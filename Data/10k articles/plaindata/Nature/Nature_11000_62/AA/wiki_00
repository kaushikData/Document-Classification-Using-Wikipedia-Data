{"id": "38398925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38398925", "title": "Animal Coloration (book)", "text": "Animal Coloration (book)\n\nAnimal Coloration, or in full Animal Coloration: An Account of the Principal Facts and Theories Relating to the Colours and Markings of Animals, is a book by the English zoologist Frank Evers Beddard, published by Swan Sonnenschein in 1892. It formed part of the ongoing debate amongst zoologists about the relevance of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to the observed appearance, structure, and behaviour of animals, and vice versa.\n\nBeddard states in the book that it contains little that is new, intending instead to give a clear overview of the subject. The main topics covered are camouflage, then called 'protective coloration'; mimicry; and sexual selection. Arguments for and against these aspects of animal coloration are intensively discussed in the book.\n\nThe book was reviewed in 1892 by the major journals including \"The Auk\", \"Nature\", and \"Science\". The scientist reviewers Joel Asaph Allen, Edward Bagnall Poulton and Robert Wilson Shufeldt took up different positions on the book and accordingly praised or criticized Beddard's work.\n\nModern evaluation of the book is from a variety of perspectives, including the history of Darwinism, the history of the Thayer debate on the purpose of camouflage, the mechanisms of camouflage, sexual selection, and mimicry. Beddard is seen as having covered a wide swath of modern biology with both theory and experiment.\n\nBeddard (1858–1925) was an English zoologist specializing in Annelid worms, but writing much more widely on topics including mammals and zoogeography. He also contributed articles on earthworms, leeches and nematode worms to the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\". His decision to write an accessible book on animal coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote \"Animal Coloration\" at a time when scientists' confidence in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was at a low ebb. Beddard's book was part of an ongoing debate among zoologists about how far natural selection affected animals, and how far other forces – such as the direct action of light – might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. Edward Bagnall Poulton's far more strongly pro-Darwinian book \"The Colours of Animals\" had appeared just two years earlier in 1890.\n\nBeddard explains in his preface that the book grew from his 1890 Davis Lectures given for the public at London Zoo. The book \"contains hardly anything novel, but professes to give some account of the principal phenomena of coloration exhibited by animals.\" He also notes that since Poulton's recent book \"deal[s] with colour almost entirely from the point of view of natural selection, I have attempted to lay some stress upon other aspects of the question.\" Similarly, because Poulton treated insects in some detail, Beddard chooses to give more attention to other groups, though \"it is impossible not to devote a good deal of space to insects\". The examples are mainly from Beddard's own observation of \"animals that may be usually seen in the Zoological Society's Gardens\", though he also introduces and quotes the work of other scientists, including Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace.\n\nThe book has four colour plates by Peter Smit, who both drew and prepared the chromolithographic plates. Plate 1 is stated in the \"List of Illustrations\" \"To face page 108\", but as bound in the first edition it is used as a Frontispiece, facing the title page.\n\nThere are also 36 woodcuts (in black and white) in the text, though one of these, \"Eolis and Dendronotus\" is intentionally repeated as figures 10 and 19 to accompany the text in two places. The woodcuts vary from small line drawings on a simple white background (as in the diagrammatic figure 28 of \"Psyche helix\", and figure 34 of the winter moth) to page-width illustrations like figure 2 which shows ermines in winter pelage, in a realistic depiction with a detailed snowy scene in the background. The woodcuts are certainly by a number of different artists; many are unsigned, but figures 5 and 26 are signed \"E.A. Brockhaus X.A\" lower right (X=cut, A=Artist), while figure 29 is signed \"GM\" lower left, and figures 35 and 36 are signed \"ES\" lower left. Figure 2 bears a monograph \"FR\", lower left, and figure 7, of the penguin \"Aptenodytes patagonica\" is stated to be \"from Brehm\" (\"Brehms Tierleben\").\n\n\"Animal Coloration\" has a simple structure of six chapters in its 288 pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American zoologist and ornithologist Joel Asaph Allen reviewed \"Animal Coloration\" in \"The Auk\" in 1893. Allen notes Beddard's remark that the book contains hardly anything novel, so that it is mainly a review of previous theories, but welcomes it as a review of the state of knowledge together with Beddard's critical commentary. Allen notes that Beddard could have gone further in criticising Weismann and Poulton on colour changes, but is \"glad to see [that Beddard] is willing to grant that the influence of an animal's surroundings may exercise a direct influence upon its coloration without the intervention of the agency of 'natural selection.'\"\n\nAllen praises Beddard's \"commendable conservatism\" in his discussion of camouflage, which he compares to the \"credulous spirit\" of other authors. Reviewing the chapter on warning coloration, Allen remarks that the great horned owl is known to prey on the skunk, showing that even such a disagreeably pungent animal can be subject to predation.\n\nOn mimicry, Allen is critical of Bates's theory, arguing that edible mimics (such as flies) are often not protected by resembling distasteful models (such as wasps). Allen notes that Beddard deals with many special cases \"as of .. spiders mimicking ants, etc.\" and finds the arguments against any selective advantage from Batesian mimicry, and so against natural selection, somewhat conclusive. Finally, reviewing the chapter on sexual selection, Allen writes (knowing that Wallace largely rejected sexual selection)\n\nAllen then makes some remarks, praising Beddard for the \"fine vein of irony\" that he uses of\n\nThe zoologist Edward Bagnall Poulton, whose work is referred to throughout Beddard's book, reviewed \"Animal Coloration\" in \"Nature\" in 1892. Poulton is critical of Beddard and other authors, defending Darwin's theory of natural selection as \"the most generally accepted explanation of organic evolution\" and insisting that in \"case after case\" the Darwinian explanation turns out to be correct.\n\nThe white supremacist scientist Robert Wilson Shufeldt reviewed \"Animal Coloration\" in \"Science\" in 1892, praising it as a concise and useful summary of the subject. He admires Macmillan Publishers' handling of the book with its attractive wood-cuts and coloured lithographic plates. He is pleased to find many Americans in the index. He quotes Beddard's distinction between colour and coloration. He considers that the book brings readers fully up to date and even adds a few new ideas. He recommends the book to all working American naturalists.\n\nThe anonymous reviewer in \"Popular Science Monthly\" in December 1892 writes that Beddard has \"made a book interesting to both the zoologist and the general reader.\" On protective coloration, \"he raises the question whether as a matter of fact animals are concealed from their foes by their protective resemblances, and shows that there is much evidence on the negative side\", and further that such colours are sometimes produced \"more simply and directly than by the operation of natural selection.\" On warning colours, the reviewer notes that Beddard gives \"much weight\" to Eisig's theory that \"the usual bright pigments\" in caterpillars (accidentally) cause inedibility, \"instead of being produced to advertise it\" and that Beddard cautions against assuming that \"the sight or taste of animals were the same as that of man\".\n\nBeddard's \"Animal Coloration\" is cited and discussed both by historians of science, and by practising scientists from a number of different fields. For example, the book illuminates the progress of Darwinism, camouflage research, sexual selection, mimicry and the debate on the purpose of animal coloration triggered by Abbott Thayer. These areas are described in turn below.\n\nThe historian Robinson M. Yost explains that Darwinism went into eclipse during the 1890s. At that time, most zoologists felt that natural selection could not be the main cause of biological adaptation, and sought alternative explanations. As a result, many zoologists rejected both Batesian mimicry and Müllerian mimicry. Beddard, writes Yost, explained some problems in the theory of mimicry including that, given how many insect species there are, resemblances between species could arise by chance, and that mimicry was sometimes either useless or actually harmful. In Yost's view, Beddard wanted more evidence that natural selection really was responsible. Yost cites the staunch Darwinist Poulton's hostile review of 1892, which asserts the pre-eminence of Darwin's theory. But, writes Yost, Beddard was not alone in being wary of natural selection.\n\nThe zoologist Martin Stevens and colleagues, in 2006, write that \"almost all early discussions of camouflage were of the background-matching type\", citing Wallace, Poulton, and Beddard, \"until the pioneering work of Thayer (1909) and Cott (1940)\", which added disruptive coloration. Cott however both makes use of Beddard as an authority (for the fact that the Hudson's Bay lemming turns white in winter whereas the Scandinavian lemming does not, and for his experiments on the effectiveness of prey coloration on predators) and is critical of him for the \"extreme and illogical\" opinion held by Beddard and other authors that keeping perfectly still is vital to camouflage. Cott pointed out on that subject that a cryptic colour scheme makes an animal harder to track and to recognize, even while it is moving.\n\nThe ornithologist Geoffrey Edward Hill, writing in 2002, notes that both Poulton and Beddard discuss sexual selection, and both agreed that \"sexual selection by female choice is a likely explanation for the bright coloration of at least some species of birds\". In contrast, Hill observes, Cott's detailed 1940 book does not mention it at all; like other zoologists including Wallace and Huxley, Cott preferred explanations \"firmly rooted in natural selection\".\n\nThe American evolutionary zoologists Jane Van Zandt Brower and Lincoln Pierson Brower followed up the experiments described in the book (pp. 153–159). Beddard, they write, observed the results of feeding the drone fly \"Eristalis tenax\", a harmless but intimidating Batesian mimic of honeybees, to various predators. A chameleon, a green lizard, and a sand skink eagerly consumed the flies, whereas a thrush and a great spotted woodpecker did not. However, they — like Cott before them, they note — were unable to replicate Beddard's claim that toads would eat insects of any kind, including stinging bees and wasps. They describe their own experimental investigations of bees and their drone fly mimics, like Beddard using toads as the predators, concluding that the Batesian mimicry of the honeybee by the drone fly was \"highly effective\".\n\nThe historian of science Sharon Kingsland, in a 1978 paper on \"Abbott Thayer and the protective coloration debate\", uses Beddard repeatedly to illuminate the different strands of the argument. She quotes Beddard (p. 94) on how difficult the question of animal coloration seemed in the 1890s. Thayer — an artist, not a scientist — had dived head-first into the debate. One of the protagonists, notes Kingsland, was Joel Asaph Allen, who had reviewed Beddard's book, and who believed that the environment directly influenced animal coloration — Kingsland cites Beddard p. 54 here —, so natural selection seemed to him an unlikely factor, and he pointed out that blending inheritance would dilute the effect of selection. Furthermore, argues Kingsland, again citing Beddard (p. 148), another major protagonist, Alfred Russel Wallace, was emphasizing the problem of conspicuous markings, which could be selected for as warning coloration.\n\nWallace went so far as to argue, notes Kingsland, that bright colours in sexual dimorphism \"resulted from a surplus of vital energy\", citing Beddard p. 263 ff. Thayer, on the other hand, had exactly one explanation for everything: natural selection for protective coloration, in particular camouflage by countershading, which radically departed from earlier explanations such as Allen's environmental influences (colours might be affected by light) or Beddard's suggestion that dolphins might have dark backs and light bellies as camouflage when seen from above and from below (Kingsland cites Beddard, p. 115).\n\n"}

He fell in love during their encounter, but she fled after discovering his presence and intentions, as she wished to remain a chaste attendant of Artemis. After a long chase, she prayed to her goddess to ask for protection. Artemis hid her in a cloud, but Alpheus was persistent. She began to perspire profusely from fear, and soon transformed into a stream. Artemis then broke the ground allowing Arethusa another attempt to flee. Her stream traveled under the sea to the island of Ortygia, but Alpheus flowed through the sea to reach her and mingle with her waters. Virgil augurs for Arethusa a salt-free passage beneath the sea on the condition that, before departing, she grant him songs about troubled loves, not those in her own future, but those of Virgil's friend and contemporary, the poet Cornelius Gallus, whom Virgil imagines dying from unrequited love beneath the famous mountains of Arcadia, Maenalus and Lycaeus.During Demeter's search for her daughter Persephone, Arethusa entreated Demeter to discontinue her punishment of Sicily for her daughter's disappearance. She told the goddess that while traveling in her stream below the earth, she saw her daughter looking sad as the queen of Hades.\n\nThe Roman writer Ovid called Arethusa by the name \"Alpheias\", because her stream was believed to have a subterranean communication with the river Alpheius, in Peloponnesus.\n\nApart from retellings by classical authors including Ovid and Virgil, Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote a poem on \"Arethusa\" in 1820.\nAs a patron figure of Syracuse, the head of Arethusa surrounded by dolphins was a usual type on their coins. They are regarded as among the most famous and beautiful Ancient Greek coins.\n\nKarol Szymanowski, polish classical music composer named \"The Fountain of Arethusa\" first of his three poems entitled \"Myths\" for violin and piano.\nThe Saucy Arethusa is an 18th-century song about a British naval ship named after Arethusa.

A movement of Benjamin Britten's oboe piece \"Six Metamorphoses After Ovid\" is entitled \"Arethusa.\"\n\nAlso Ralph Vaughan Williams, the English classical music composer, composed \"Sea Songs\", a quick march for both brass band and wind band written in 1923, used a Morris Dance tune 'The Royal Princess' which was also known by the title 'The Arethusa', alongside two other shanty tunes 'Admiral Benbow' and 'Portsmouth'.\n\n\n"}

Absorption is complete by 90 days, and full tensile strength remains for at least 7 days. This eventual disintegration makes it good for use in rapidly healing tissues and in internal structures that cannot be re-accessed for suture removal.\n\nCatgut suture has high knot-pull tensile strength and good knot security due to special excellent handling features. It is used for all surgical procedures including general closure, ophthalmic, orthopedics, obstetrics/gynecology and gastrointestinal surgery. It is absorbed faster in patients with cancer, anemia, and malnutrition. It also absorbed faster when used in the mouth and the vagina, due to the presence of microorganisms.\n\nCatgut has largely been replaced by synthetic absorbable polymers such as Vicryl and polydioxanone. It is not used at all for human surgery in some countries. In Europe and Japan, gut sutures have been banned due to concerns that they could transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease), although the herds from which gut is harvested are certified BSE-free.\n\nCatgut suture is made by twisting together strands of purified collagen taken from the serosal or submucosal layer of the small intestine of healthy ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats) or from beef tendon. The natural plain thread is precision ground in order to achieve a monofilament character and treated with a glycerol-containing solution. The suture is sterilized with a sterilizing fluid containing ethylene oxide, isopropyl alcohol and distilled water. Catgut suture is straw-colored, and is available in sizes USP 6-0 (1 metric) to USP 3 (7 metric).\nAlthough the name implies the usage of guts of cats, there is no record of feline guts being used for this purpose. The word catgut is deived from the term kitgut or kitstring (the string used on a kit, or fiddle). Misinterpretation of the word kit as referring to a young cat led to the use of the term catgut. Surgical gut is in fact made from the submucosa of sheep intestine or the serosa of bovine intestine and is approximately 90% collagen. Perhaps another possible explanation of the name is the combination of the words cattle and gut. B Braun Medical AG, a German Multi National company first industrialized catgut suture and Catgut is a brand registered with B Braun.\n\nCatgut Chrome (B Braun) suture is a variant treated with chromic acid salts. This treatment produces roughly twice the stitch-holding time of plain catgut, but greater tissue inflammation occurs. Full tensile strength is extended to 18–21 days. It is brown rather than straw-colored, and has improved smoothness due to the dry presentation of the thread (plain catgut is wet). It is otherwise similar to plain catgut.\n\nFast catgut suture is heat-treated to give even more rapid absorption in the body.\n\nThe first known absorbable sutures were made of the intestines of sheep. The manufacturing process was similar to that of natural musical strings for violins and guitar, and also of natural strings for tennis racquets.\n\nGut strings were being used as medical sutures as early as the 3rd century AD as Galen, a prominent Greek physician from the Roman Empire, is known to have used them.\n"}

By connecting Turkmenistan to China’s domestic grid, this pipeline makes it possible to transport gas some 7000 km from Turkmenistan to Shanghai\n\nThe initial proposal for Central Asia–China gas pipeline was presented as the Kazakhstan–China gas pipeline, which was to follow along the Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline. In June 2003, during China's President Hu Jintao's visit to Kazakhstan, agreements to expedite the appraisal of the project were signed. Following these agreements, KazMunayGas and PetroChina started a feasibility study of the pipeline project. At the same time China continued negotiations with other Central Asian countries.\n\nOn 3 April 2006, China and Turkmenistan signed a framework agreement on the pipeline construction and long-term gas supply. In June 2007, during his visit to China, Turkmeni President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow signed an accord to speed up implementation of the Turkmeni-Chinese gas pipeline project. On 30 April 2007, Uzbekistan and China signed an agreement on the construction and exploitation of the pipeline's Uzbekistan section. In July 2007, it was formally announced that Turkmenistan will join original Kazakhstan-China pipeline project. On 8 November 2007, Kazakhstan's oil company KazMunayGas signed an agreement with the China National Petroleum Corporation on principles of future work on the pipeline.\n\nOn 30 August 2007, the construction of the long Turkmen section of the pipeline began. This section was built by Stroytransgaz, a subsidiary of Gazprom. Main contractors were China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation, and Zeromax. Construction of the Uzbek section started on 30 June 2008. It was built by Asia Trans Gas, a joint venture of Uzbekneftegas and CNPC. Construction works of the Kazakh section started on 9 July 2008 and the first stage was finished in July 2009. It was built by Asian Gas Pipeline company, a joint venture of CNPC and KazMunayGas. The main contractors of this section were KazStroyService and China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation. The first of the two initial parallel line were completed early November 2009.\n\nThe Kazakh section of the pipeline was inaugurated on 12 December 2009 during China's president Hu Jintao's visit to Kazakhstan. The whole pipeline was inaugurated on 14 December 2009 in a ceremony in Saman-Depe during Hu Jintao's visit to Turkmenistan with the leaders of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.\nOn 13 June 2010 China and Kazakhstan signed an agreement on a branch line from Western Kazakhstan.\n\nThe second line was completed by the end of 2010. Construction of the third line began in 2012. It became operational on 15 June 2014, and is expected to reach the designed throughput of in December 2015. The construction of a fourth line of the pipeline is expected to be launched at the end of 2014.\n\nAccording to CNPC, the inflow of Turkmen gas helps China in meeting its energy demands and stabilizes the country's overall consumption structure. It was expected that the pipeline's deliveries boost the natural gas proportion of energy consumption of China by an estimated 2%, which reduces the overall smoke, dust and carbon dioxide emissions. For Turkmenistan, the project helps the country diversify its energy exports by delivering gas eastward as opposed to its previous deliveries to Russia and Iran. Until the inauguration of the pipeline, nearly 70% of Turkmenistan's gas exports transited through Russian pipelines. Central Asia–China gas pipeline is the first pipeline to bring Central Asian natural gas to China and highlights China's quest for Central Asian energy exports. While Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are also considering selling their gas to China, Chinese government already made new moves to penetrate deeper into Central Asian energy sector by lending $3 billion to Turkmenistan to develop the South Iolotan field in 2009 and $10 billion to Kazakhstan to pay for future oil supplies.\n\nThe whole pipeline is about long, of which in Turkmenistan and in Uzbekistan. The diameter of the pipeline is . It consists of three parallel lines with combined total capacity of which would be reached by 2015. Construction of the first line cost US$7.3 billion. The pipeline project also includes the purification plant at Samand-Depe to remove high sulfur content of natural gas.\n\nThe pipeline starts in Saman-Depe carrying natural gas from the Bagtyyarlyk gas fields on the right bank of Amu Darya in Turkmenistan. It is mainly supplied from Iolotan and Sag Kenar fields. The pipeline enters Uzbekistan in Olot and runs across Uzbekistan to southern Kazakhstan parallel to the existing Bukhara–Tashkent–Bishkek–Almaty pipeline. The pipeline crosses the Kazakhstan–China border at Khorgos, where it is connected to the second West–East Gas Pipeline.\n\nIn Shymkent, the pipeline will be linked with the branch line from Beyneu in western Kazakhstan. It will supply natural gas from the Karachaganak, Tengiz and Kashagan gas fields. The branch line will have a capacity of 15 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. It will be commissioned in 2014.\n\n\n"}

Along with the chrysanthemum, the cherry blossom is considered the national flower of Japan.\n\nMany of the varieties that have been cultivated for ornamental use produce small, unpalatable fruit. Edible cherries generally come from cultivars of the related species \"Prunus avium\" and \"Prunus cerasus\".\n\n\"Hanami\" is the centuries-old practice of picnicking under a blooming \"sakura\" or \"ume\" tree. The custom is said to have started during the Nara period (710–794), when it was \"ume\" blossoms that people admired in the beginning, but by the Heian period (794–1185) cherry blossoms came to attract more attention, and \"hanami\" was synonymous with \"sakura\". From then on, in both waka and haiku, meant \"cherry blossoms\". The custom was originally limited to the elite of the Imperial Court, but soon spread to samurai society and, by the Edo period, to the common people as well. Tokugawa Yoshimune planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the \"sakura\" trees, people had lunch and drank sake in cheerful feasts.\n\nEvery year the Japanese Meteorological Agency and the public track the \"sakura zensen\" (cherry blossom front) as it moves northward up the archipelago with the approach of warmer weather via nightly forecasts following the weather segment of news programs. The blossoming begins in Okinawa in January, and typically reaches Kyoto and Tokyo at the end of March or the beginning of April. It proceeds into areas at the higher altitudes and northward, arriving in Hokkaido a few weeks later. Japanese pay close attention to these forecasts and turn out in large numbers at parks, shrines and temples with family and friends to hold flower-viewing parties. \"Hanami\" festivals celebrate the beauty of the cherry blossom and for many are a chance to relax and enjoy the beautiful view. The custom of \"hanami\" dates back many centuries in Japan. The eighth-century chronicle \"Nihon Shoki\" (日本書紀) records \"hanami\" festivals being held as early as the third century AD.\n\nMost Japanese schools and public buildings have cherry blossom trees outside of them. Since the fiscal and school year both begin in April, in many parts of Honshu, the first day of work or school coincides with the cherry blossom season.\n\nThe Japan Cherry Blossom Association developed a list of Japan's Top 100 Cherry Blossom Spots with at least one location in every prefecture.\n\nIn Japan, cherry blossoms symbolize clouds due to their nature of blooming \"\", besides being an enduring metaphor for the ephemeral nature of life, an aspect of Japanese cultural tradition that is often associated with Buddhist influence, and which is embodied in the concept of \"mono no aware\". The association of the cherry blossom with \"mono no aware\" dates back to 18th-century scholar Motoori Norinaga. The transience of the blossoms, the exquisite beauty and volatility, has often been associated with mortality and graceful and readily acceptance of destiny and karma; for this reason, cherry blossoms are richly symbolic, and have been utilized often in Japanese art, manga, anime, and film, as well as at musical performances for ambient effect. There is at least one popular folk song, originally meant for the shakuhachi (bamboo flute), titled \"Sakura\", and several pop songs. The flower is also represented on all manner of consumer goods in Japan, including kimono, stationery, and dishware.\nThe \"Sakurakai\" or Cherry Blossom Society was the name chosen by young officers within the Imperial Japanese Army in September 1930 for their secret society established with the goal of reorganizing the state along totalitarian militaristic lines, via a military coup d'état if necessary.\n\nDuring World War II, the cherry blossom was used to motivate the Japanese people, to stoke nationalism and militarism among the populace. Even prior to the war, they were used in propaganda to inspire \"Japanese spirit\", as in the \"Song of Young Japan\", exulting in \"warriors\" who were \"ready like the myriad cherry blossoms to scatter\". In 1932, Akiko Yosano's poetry urged Japanese soldiers to endure sufferings in China and compared the dead soldiers to cherry blossoms. Arguments that the plans for the Battle of Leyte Gulf, involving all Japanese ships, would expose Japan to serious danger if they failed, were countered with the plea that the Navy be permitted to \"bloom as flowers of death\". The last message of the forces on Peleliu was \"Sakura, Sakura\" — cherry blossoms. Japanese pilots would paint them on the sides of their planes before embarking on a suicide mission, or even take branches of the trees with them on their missions. A cherry blossom painted on the side of the bomber symbolized the intensity and ephemerality of life; in this way, the aesthetic association was altered such that falling cherry petals came to represent the sacrifice of youth in suicide missions to honor the emperor. The first kamikaze unit had a subunit called \"Yamazakura\" or wild cherry blossom. The government even encouraged the people to believe that the souls of downed warriors were reincarnated in the blossoms.\n\nIn its colonial enterprises, Imperial Japan often planted cherry trees as a means of \"claiming occupied territory as Japanese space\".\n\nCherry blossoms are a prevalent symbol in Irezumi, the traditional art of Japanese tattoos. In tattoo art, cherry blossoms are often combined with other classic Japanese symbols like koi fish, dragons or tigers.\n\nIt was later used for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics mascot Someity.\n\nJapan has a wide variety of cherry blossoms (\"sakura\"); well over 200 cultivars can be found there. The following species, hybrids, and varieties are used for \"sakura\":\nThe most popular variety of cherry blossom in Japan is the \"Somei Yoshino\". Its flowers are nearly pure white, tinged with the palest pink, especially near the stem. They bloom and usually fall within a week, before the leaves come out. Therefore, the trees look nearly white from top to bottom. The variety takes its name from the village of Somei (now part of Toshima in Tokyo). It was developed in the mid- to late-19th century at the end of the Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji period. The \"Somei Yoshino\" is so widely associated with cherry blossoms that \"jidaigeki\" and other works of fiction often depict the variety in the Edo period or earlier; such depictions are anachronisms.\n\nWinter \"sakura\" or \"fuyuzakura\" (\"Prunus subhirtella autumnalis\") begins to bloom in the fall and continues blooming sporadically throughout the winter. It is said to be a cross between \"edohiganzakura\", the Tokyo Higan cherry (\"P. incisa\") and \"mamezakura\" (\"P. pendula\").\n\nOther categories include \"yamazakura\", \"yaezakura,\" and \"shidarezakura\". The yaezakura have large flowers, thick with rich pink petals. The \"shidarezakura\", or weeping cherry, has branches that fall like those of a weeping willow, bearing cascades of pink flowers.\n\nDuring World War II, a prisoner of war (POW) camp near the town of Cowra in New South Wales, Australia, was the site of one of the largest prison escapes of the war, on 5 August 1944. During the Cowra breakout and subsequent rounding up of POWs, four Australian soldiers and 231 Japanese soldiers died and 108 prisoners were wounded. The Japanese War Cemetery holding the dead from the Breakout was tended after the war by members of the Cowra RSL and ceded to Japan in 1963. In 1971 the Cowra Tourism Development decided to celebrate this link to Japan, and proposed a Japanese garden for the town. The Japanese government agreed to support this development as a sign of thanks for the respectful treatment of their war dead; the development also received funding from the Australian government and private entities.\n\nThe garden was designed by Ken Nakajima (1914–2000), a world-renowned designer of Japanese gardens at the time. The first stage was opened in 1979, and a second stage in 1986. The gardens were designed in the style of the Edo period and are a \"kaiyū-shiki\" or strolling garden. They are designed to show all of the landscape types of Japan. At five hectares (12 acres), the Cowra Japanese Garden is the largest Japanese garden in the Southern Hemisphere. An annual cherry blossom festival during September is now a major event in Cowra's tourism calendar.\n\nWith the Japanese diaspora to Brazil, many immigrants brought seedlings of cherry trees. In São Paulo State, home to the largest Japanese community outside Japan, it is common to find them in Japan-related facilities and in some homes, usually of the cultivars \"Prunus serrulata\" 'Yukiwari' and \"Prunus serrulata\" var. \"lannesiana\" 'Himalaya'. Some cities, as Garça and Campos do Jordão, have annual festivals to celebrate the blooming of the trees and the Japanese culture. In the Parana State (in southern Brazil), many cities received many of these immigrants, who planted the trees, as in Apucarana, Maringá, Cascavel and especially in the capital city of Curitiba.\n\nIn the capital city of Paraná, the first seedlings were brought by Japanese immigrants in the first half of the 20th century, but large quantities of them were only planted from the 1990s, with the opening of the Botanical Garden of Curitiba. Nowadays the seedlings are produced locally and used in afforestation of streets and squares – as in the Japanese Square, where there are more than 30 cherry trees around the square which were sent by the Japanese Empire to Curitiba.\n\nVancouver, British Columbia is famous for its thousands of cherry trees (estimated 50,000) lining many streets and in many parks, including Queen Elizabeth Park and Stanley Park. Vancouver holds the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival every year. With multiple varieties and a temperate climate, they begin to bloom in February yearly and peak in April.\n\nHigh Park in Toronto, Ontario features many Somei-Yoshino cherry trees (the earliest species to bloom and much loved by the Japanese for their fluffy white flowers) that were given to Toronto by Japan in 1959. Through the Sakura Project, the Japanese Consulate donated a further 34 cherry trees to High Park in 2001, plus cherry trees to various other locations like Exhibition Place, McMaster University, York University (near Calumet College and on Ottawa Road near McLaughlin College) and the University of Toronto's main (next to Robarts Library) and Scarborough campuses. Niagara Falls also has many near the Falls itself. Royal Botanical Gardens in Burlington and Hamilton was also the recipient of a number of Somei-Yoshino cherry trees that were donated by the Consulate-General of Japan in Toronto as part of the Sakura Project. The trees are located in the Arboretum and the Rock Garden and were planted to celebrate the continual strengthening of friendship between Japan and Canada. Peak bloom time at Royal Botanical Gardens is normally around the last week of April or the first week of May.\n\nCherry trees naturally grow in the middle northern or southern part of China, the area nearby the sea. However, the most famous cherry blossom parks in China reflect Japan's brief occupation of parts of China during the first half of the 20th century or the donation from Japan thereafter:\n\nParc de Sceaux, located in a suburb of Paris, has two orchards of cherry trees, one for white cherry blossoms (Prunus avium) and one for pink cherry blossoms (Prunus serrulata), the latter with about 150 trees that attract many visitors when they bloom in early April.\n\nThe cherry blossom is a major tourist attraction in Germany's Altes Land orchard region. The largest Hanami in Germany, in Hamburg, with Japanese-style fireworks, organized by the German-Japanese society, draws tens of thousands spectators every spring. Starting in 2015, Hamburg will be allowed to bestow the title of \"Cherry Blossom Queen\" by the Japan Cherry Blossom Association, one of only three cities worldwide to receive this privilege. The first Cherry Blossom Queen of Hamburg will be crowned by the Cherry Blossom Queen of Japan on May 23.\n\nIn 1990, along prior sections of the Berlin Wall, Japan donated cherry blossoms to express appreciation of German reunification. The gift was supported by donations from the Japanese people allowing for over 9,000 trees to be planted. The first trees were planted in November of that year near Glienicker Bridge.\n\nThe Cherry Blossom festival in the Bonn Altstadt is also very famous: .\n\nIn India, the cherry blossom is an attraction as well, most notably in Himalayan states like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Sikkim & northern districts of West Bengal of Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling. Temple towns like Kalpa, Sarahan, Chitkul, Sangla and Narkanda are notable for their wild cherry blossom during spring covering Himalayan foothills. They can also be seen in various British-era botanical gardens especially in Nilgiri Hills, Garo Hills, Khasi Hills as well as in some hill stations in the Western Ghats.\n\nPrunus cerasoides is wild Himalayan cherry and sour cherry, known in Hindi as padma or padmakashtha, is a deciduous cherry tree found in parts of East, South and Southeast Asia. It is of the family \"Rosaceae\" and the genus \"Prunus\".\nRecently Kolkata municipal department and the forest department planted cherry blossoms across main city places like Rajarhat. They were in full bloom the first week of March 2017.\n\nThe origins of cherry blossoms in South Korea is contentious. The Japanese planted Yoshino cherry trees at Seoul's Changgyeonggung Palace and the viewing of cherry blossoms was introduced to Korea during Japanese rule. The festivals continued even after the Japanese surrendered at the end of WWII but have been controversial, and many cherry trees were cut down to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Japanese surrender because they were seen as symbols of the occupation. Yet Koreans continued to plant Yoshino cherry trees and festivals began attracting a wide range of tourists. Many Korean media assert that the Yoshino cherry is the same species as a Korean indigenous, endangered species called king cherry, whose mass production is still being studied. \nIn 2007, a study conducted on the comparison of king cherry and Yoshino cherry concluded that these trees were categorized as distinct species. In 2016, a study on DNA analyses suggested the independent origin between king cherry and yoshino cherry each other. In 2016, a new scientific name \"Cerasus\" × \"nudiflora\" was given to King cherry to distinguish it from Yoshino cherry (\"Prunus\" × \"yedoensis\"). In Korea most of the places for cherry blossom festivals, including Yeouido and Jinhae, are still planted with Yoshino cherry trees.\n\nIn Korea, cherry blossoms have the meaning of purity and beauty.\n\nIn the year 2000, the Japan Women's Club (JWC) donated 400 cherry blossom trees to the city of Amstelveen. The trees have been planted in the cherry blossom park in the Amsterdamse Bos. A special detail is that every tree has a name — 200 trees have female Japanese names, 200 trees have female Dutch names.\n\nHagley Park is the largest urban open space in Christchurch, New Zealand and has many cherry blossom trees of several varieties.\n\nTypically found in mountainous areas, cherry blossoms are a popular attraction in Taiwan, with numerous specially tailored viewing tours. Among the most easily accessible and thus most popular locations for viewing them are Yangmingshan, in Taipei, and Wuling Farm, in Taichung.\n\nCherry blossoms are found in Northern Thailand.\n\nIn 2005, Japanese cherry trees were presented by Japan to the Nezahat Gökyiğit Botanical Garden in Istanbul, Turkey. Each tree represents one sailor of the frigate \"Ertogrul\" which was a famous frigate of the Ottoman Turkish navy. On the way back from a goodwill visit to Japan in 1890 she ran into a typhoon and sank with loss of 587 Ottoman Turkish sailors. That loss is being remembered at every anniversary. The Japanese cherry trees represent memory of those who died and provide remembrance.\n\nBatsford Arboretum in Gloucestershire (England), holds the national collection of Japanese village cherries, sato-sakura group. Keele University in Staffordshire (England), has one of the UK's largest collections of flowering cherries, with more than 150 varieties.\n\nJapan gave 3,020 cherry blossom trees as a gift to the United States in 1912 to celebrate the nations' then-growing friendship, replacing an earlier gift of 2,000 trees which had to be destroyed due to disease in 1910. These trees were planted in Sakura Park in Manhattan and line the shore of the Tidal Basin and the roadway in East Potomac Park in Washington, D.C. The first two original trees were planted by first lady Helen Taft and Viscountess Chinda on the bank of the Tidal Basin. The gift was renewed with another 3,800 trees in 1965. In Washington, D.C. the cherry blossom trees continue to be a popular tourist attraction (and the subject of the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival) when they reach full bloom in early spring. Just outside of Washington, D.C., the suburb of Kenwood in Bethesda, Maryland has roughly 1,200 trees that are popular with locals and tourists.\n\nNew Jersey's Branch Brook Park, which is maintained by the Essex County, is the oldest county park in the United States and is home to the nation's largest collection of cherry blossom trees, with about 5,000.\n\nAlso, Balboa Park of San Diego has 2,000 cherry blossom trees that blossom in mid to late March. In Los Angeles, over 2,000 trees are located at Lake Balboa in Van Nuys. These trees were donated by an anonymous Japanese benefactor and were planted in 1992. They originated from a single parent tree and were developed to grow in warm climates.\n\nPhiladelphia is also home to over 2,000 flowering Japanese cherry trees, half of which were a gift from the Japanese government in 1926 in honor of the 150th anniversary of American independence, with the other half planted by the Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia between 1998 and 2007. Philadelphia's cherry blossoms are located within Fairmount Park, and the annual Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival of Greater Philadelphia celebrates the blooming trees. The University of Washington in Seattle also has cherry blossoms in its Quad.\n\nOther US cities have an annual cherry blossom festival (or \"sakura matsuri\"), including the International Cherry Blossom Festival in Macon, Georgia, which features over 300,000 cherry trees. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden in New York City also has a large, well-attended festival. Portsmouth, New Hampshire, is the site of the peace conference that produced the Treaty of Portsmouth, for which the original Washington, DC cherry trees were given in thanks. Several cherry trees planted on the bank of the tidal pond next to Portsmouth City Hall were the gift of Portsmouth's Japanese sister city of Nichinan—the hometown of Marquis Komura Jutarō, Japan's representative at the conference. Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, has 200 somei yoshino trees, a gift from its sister institution, Japan's Chubu University.\n\nCherry blossoms and leaves are edible and both are used as food ingredients in Japan:\n\nSince the leaves contain coumarin, which is toxic in large doses, it is not recommended to eat them in great quantities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20837076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20837076", "title": "Energy in Saudi Arabia", "text": "Energy in Saudi Arabia\n\nEnergy in Saudi Arabia involves petroleum and natural gas production, consumption, and exports, and electricity production. Saudi Arabia is the world's leading oil producer and exporter.\nSaudi Arabia's economy is petroleum-based; oil accounts for 90% of the country's exports and nearly 75% of government revenue.\nThe oil industry produces about 45% of Saudi Arabia's gross domestic product, against 40% from the private sector. Saudi Arabia has per capita GDP of $20,700. The economy is still very dependent on oil despite diversification, in particular in the petrochemical sector.\n\nFor many years the Kingdom has been the world's largest petroleum producer and exporter. In 2011 it pumped about of petroleum. While most of this is exported, domestic use is rapidly increasing, primarily for electricity production.\nSaudi Arabia also has the largest, or one of the largest, proven crude oil reserves (i.e. oil that is economically recoverable) in the world (18% of global reserves, over ).\n\nSaudi Arabia, has one of the largest reserves of natural gas in the Persian Gulf. Proven natural gas reserves are over . Global production in 2009 reached of oil and of natural gas. but due to its sizeable domestic gas markets, is \"unlikely to become LNG exporters anytime soon\". Saudi Arabia is prioritising upstream gas investment, but for use in the domestic power generation market, not for export.\n\nThe country has had plans to diversify its energy sources for some time, developing solar and nuclear power.\n\nAs of January 2007, Saudi Aramco's proven reserves were estimated at , comprising about 24% of the world total. They would last for 90 years at the current rate of production. 85% of Saudi oil fields found have not produced oil yet.\n\nThe Ghawar oil field is the largest oil field in the world, holding over . Ghawar is able to produce of oil. Aramco announced expansion and integration with neighboring petrochemical plants in Ras Tanura and Yanbu by 2010 to 2012.\n\nHowever, according to journalist Karen Elliott House, \"some energy experts are convinced that current reserves are substantially lower than those officially claimed by Saudis and that the depletion rate is substantially faster.\" \nAccording to a former senior executive of the state-run Aramco oil company Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini the country's real oil reserves are 40% lower than the official estimate of 716 billion barrels of oil. House states, \"no convincing evidence ever has been provided to support the increase [in Saudi oil reserves]. And tellingly, in 1982 the kingdom and other OPEC oil producers ceased releasing production data by field. ... Finally, Saudi Arabia has not revised its reserve estimate since 1988, even though it has pumped somewhere between 5 million and 9 million barrels a day for the intervening two decades, for a total of nearly 50 billion barrels.\"\n\nNew oil fields will add up to to production capacity by 2011. The new fields are Haradh, Khurais, Khusaniyah, Manifa, Neutral Zone (shared with Kuwait), Nuayyin and Shaybah I II & III.\n\nSaudi-Arabia is the major oil producer in the world accounting for 12.9% of the global production.\n\nSaudi Arabia produces over of oil, exporting . The government is investing over $71 Billion to increase oil production to near by 2009 and up to by 2015. This may be attributed to the report that of excess capacity are needed to compensate for a natural decline in availability.\n\nThe future of Saudi Arabian oil is complicated by the fact that the major Saudi oil fields are extremely old and have been producing oil for decades. Corrosion is becoming a large problem in addition to many other problems that come over time. The result is that most of the easily produced oil is gone from these fields and tapping the rest of the oil is probably going to be much more difficult and more expensive. Such increased difficulty and expense may indicate that Saudi Arabian oil fields have already peaked.\n\nThe majority of the oil is shipped via supertankers to refineries around the world. Three major ports are used for the shipping. Ras Tanura is the world's largest offshore oil loading facility with capacity. The Ras al-Ju'aymah facility, on the coast of the Persian Gulf, loads nearly 75% of the exports. The last of the three largest terminals is the Yanbu terminal located on the Red Sea. The enormous sea shipping capacity is vital to Saudi Arabia given the absence of international pipelines.\n\nFor many years Saudi's ability to increase production of oil and stabilize price spikes led it to be compared to an international central bank and be called a \"central bank of oil‘.\n\nThe Kingdom's consumption of its own oil production has steadily increased and it now consumes about one quarter of its oil production (approximately three million barrels per day). As of 2012 petrol in Saudi Arabia was sold at a price cheaper than bottled water—approximately $.50 US per gallon. According to Jim Krane, \"Saudi Arabia now consumes more oil than Germany, an industrialized country with triple the population and an economy nearly five times as large.\" According to a report by Citigroup’s analyst Heidy Rehman, \"As a result of its subsidies we calculate 'lost' oil and gas revenues to Saudi Arabia in 2011 to be over $80 billion\", adding that \"at the domestic level, we believe the only real way to rationalize energy consumption would be to reduce subsidy levels.\"\n\nUntil 1973 the government did not receive a share of the oil drilled within its boundaries. In 1973 the Saudi government gained a 25% share of the interest from Aramco. In 1980 the Saudi government purchased nearly 100% of the Aramco oil business giving Saudi officials complete control over prices and production. In 1988 the oil company was renamed Saudi Aramco. The company is controlled by the government but also has a board of advisors and a CEO. The current CEO and President of Saudi Aramco is Amin H. Al-Nasser.\n\nThe future prospects of energy in Saudi Arabia have been studied extensively by the King Abdullah Pertroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC). Furthermore, Saudi officials are not concerned about alternative energy sources hurting the market for its exports. In a recent interview with CBS, they asked Saudi Arabia’s oil minister the following question: \"Let me be blunt, okay? And ask you to be candid: is it Aramco’s hope to prevent a switch away from oil? Somebody said, 'The country is the oil business.' You absolutely need to do this for your own survival\". The minister responded by stating that:\n\nSaudi oil policy is shaped by multiple factors and as these factors change and/or as new information becomes available, Saudi Arabia’s oil policy will also change.\n\nSaudi Arabia has the world's fourth largest reserves of natural gas, of . One-third of this reserve is found in the Ghawar. Before the master gas system, the oil company flared (burned) the gas as it came from the oil well. Until recently production of natural gas was tightly controlled as it is so closely linked to oil production. The World Trade Organization criticized the government and Aramco for heavily subsidizing natural gas. According to the Energy Information Administration the price was $0.75 MMBtu American dollars.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the fastest growing electricity consumer in the Middle East, particularly of transportation fuels. In 2005, Saudi Arabia was the world's 15th largest consumer of primary energy, of which over 60 percent was petroleum-based. The remainder was made up of natural gas.\n\nTwo ministries share responsibility for the energy sector: the Ministry of Oil and the Ministry of Water and Electricity. The Ministry of Water was created in 2001 by merging water related sub-departments. Its stated purpose is \"to prepare a comprehensive plan to establish water and sewage networks all over the Kingdom. It will also develop the country’s water policies and propose new regulations to preserve water.\" In 2003, this department was expanded.\n\nElectricity consumption in Saudi Arabia increased sharply during the 1990–2010 period due to rapid economic development. Peak loads reached nearly 24 GW in 2001—25 times their 1975 level-and are expected to approach 60 GW by 2023. The investment needed to meet this demand may exceed $90 billion. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop energy conservation policies for sustainable development.\n\nElectricity generation is 40% from Oil 52% from Natural Gas and 8% from steam. Generation capacity is approximately 55 GW. A looming energy shortage requires Saudi Arabia to increase its capacity. Capacity is planned to be increased to 120 GW by 2032.\n\nThe government has approved the construction of a $300 million facility to turn waste into energy. The facility will process 180 tons of waste per day, producing 6 MW of electricity and of distilled water.\n\nTowards the end of 1998, the electricity sector embarked upon a major restructuring program. One of its aims was to achieve sustainable performance. Although progress has been made, remaining challenges, include high demand growth, low generation capacity reserve margins, inefficient energy use, absence of time-of-use rate adjustments, and the need for large capital investments to fund expansion.\n\nCurrent sustainable policies, particularly those encouraging energy conservation, led to peak load savings of more than 871 MW in 2001, mainly as a result of collaboration between the Ministry of Water and Electricity and the Saudi Electricity Company.\n\nPolicies and programs are being developed for public awareness, energy regulation and legislation, and energy information and programming. If energy conservation is successful, demand can be reduced by 5–10%. This is equivalent to 3–6 GW of additional capacity, which represents a possible $1.5–3.0 billion saving over 20 years. Typically, investment in energy efficiency is 1% of utility sales revenues, which for a country like Saudi Arabia could be $15–60 million annually. If only savings on air conditioning are considered, the return on investment is equivalent to 400–500 MW of generating capacity—a saving of up to $0.25 billion p.a.\n\nThe development of electricity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia can be divided into two stages:\n\nPhase 1: Initially, electricity generation was left to small, local companies. Such companies sold power at varying rates according to local costs.\n\nIn 1961 (1381 AH), the Department of Electricity Affairs was established within the Ministry of Commerce, with a mandate to regulate the electricity generation sector and to issue permits and licenses to electricity companies and to encourage national investment.\n\nIn 1972 (1392 AH), the Department of Electricity Services was established. This Department was separated from the Ministry of Commerce and was given the additional responsibility of planning electrical services for the Kingdom as a whole.\n\nIn 1974 (1394 AH), the Ministry of Commerce was divided into the Commerce Agency and the Industry and Electricity Agency. In that same year, the electricity tariff was set for all companies at a level below their actual costs.\n\nIn 1975 (1395 AH), the Government adopted ambitious plans for economic development requiring investment in industry and electrification. The Ministry of Industry and Electricity was formed, with an Industrial Affairs Agency and an Electricity Affairs Agency. The Electricity Affairs Agency expanded the planning, co-ordination and regulatory roles for providing electrical services. The Electricity Corporation was established in 1976 (1396 AH) to coordinate the electricity plans contained in the Kingdom's Development Plan.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1981 (1396 – 1401 AH) all community electricity generation was gradually subsumed under the four regional Saudi Consolidated Electricity Companies (SCECOs), located in the Central, Eastern, Southern and Western regions.\n\nWith the formulation of a coherent development plan and the establishment of the SCECOs, the Government was able to bring electricity to the towns, villages and settlements throughout the Kingdom.\n\nThe number of electricity customers grew from 216,000 in 1970 (1390 AH) to 3,035,000 in 1996 and 4,955,906 in 2006.\n\nIn May 2003, electricity was made the responsibility of the Ministry of Water and Electricity.\n\nThe first SCECO (SCECO-East) was created in 1976 (1396/97 AH). This was followed in 1979 (1399/1400 AH) by SCECO-South. Electricity for the southwest is provided by another consolidated company, and the central region is served by SCECO-Central.\n\nThe General Electricity Corporation (GEC) had overall responsibility for the Kingdom's electricity system and had direct responsibility for the provision of electrical supplies to rural areas not then covered by the consolidated companies.

{"id": "3588836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3588836", "title": "Hardness", "text": "Hardness\n\nHardness is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation induced by either mechanical indentation or abrasion. Some materials (e.g. metals) are harder than others (e.g. plastics, wood). Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong intermolecular bonds, but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; therefore, there are different measurements of hardness: \"scratch hardness\", \"indentation hardness\", and \"rebound hardness\".\n\nHardness is dependent on ductility, elastic stiffness, plasticity, strain, strength, toughness, viscoelasticity, and viscosity.\n\nCommon examples of hard matter are ceramics, concrete, certain metals, and superhard materials, which can be contrasted with soft matter.\n\nThere are three main types of hardness measurements: \"scratch\", \"indentation\", and \"rebound\". Within each of these classes of measurement there are individual measurement scales. For practical reasons conversion tables are used to convert between one scale and another.\n\nScratch hardness is the measure of how resistant a sample is to fracture or permanent plastic deformation due to friction from a sharp object. The principle is that an object made of a harder material will scratch an object made of a softer material. When testing coatings, scratch hardness refers to the force necessary to cut through the film to the substrate. The most common test is Mohs scale, which is used in mineralogy. One tool to make this measurement is the sclerometer.\n\nAnother tool used to make these tests is the pocket hardness tester. This tool consists of a scale arm with graduated markings attached to a four-wheeled carriage. A scratch tool with a sharp rim is mounted at a predetermined angle to the testing surface. In order to use it a weight of known mass is added to the scale arm at one of the graduated markings, the tool is then drawn across the test surface. The use of the weight and markings allows a known pressure to be applied without the need for complicated machinery.\n\nIndentation hardness measures the resistance of a sample to material deformation due to a constant compression load from a sharp object. Tests for indentation hardness are primarily used in engineering and metallurgy fields. The tests work on the basic premise of measuring the critical dimensions of an indentation left by a specifically dimensioned and loaded indenter.\n\nCommon indentation hardness scales are Rockwell, Vickers, Shore, and Brinell, amongst others.\n\nRebound hardness, also known as \"dynamic hardness\", measures the height of the \"bounce\" of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height onto a material. This type of hardness is related to elasticity. The device used to take this measurement is known as a scleroscope.\n\nTwo scales that measures rebound hardness are the Leeb rebound hardness test and Bennett hardness scale.\n\nThere are five hardening processes: Hall-Petch strengthening, work hardening, solid solution strengthening, precipitation hardening, and martensitic transformation.\n\nIn solid mechanics, solids generally have three responses to force, depending on the amount of force and the type of material:\n\nStrength is a measure of the extent of a material's elastic range, or elastic and plastic ranges together. This is quantified as compressive strength, shear strength, tensile strength depending on the direction of the forces involved. Ultimate strength is an engineering measure of the maximum load a part of a specific material and geometry can withstand.\n\nBrittleness, in technical usage, is the tendency of a material to fracture with very little or no detectable plastic deformation beforehand. Thus in technical terms, a material can be both brittle and strong. In everyday usage \"brittleness\" usually refers to the tendency to fracture under a small amount of force, which exhibits both brittleness and a lack of strength (in the technical sense). For perfectly brittle materials, yield strength and ultimate strength are the same, because they do not experience detectable plastic deformation. The opposite of brittleness is ductility.\n\nThe toughness of a material is the maximum amount of energy it can absorb before fracturing, which is different from the amount of force that can be applied. Toughness tends to be small for brittle materials, because elastic and plastic deformations allow materials to absorb large amounts of energy.\n\nHardness increases with decreasing particle size. This is known as the Hall-Petch relationship. However, below a critical grain-size, hardness decreases with decreasing grain size. This is known as the inverse Hall-Petch effect.\n\nHardness of a material to deformation is dependent on its microdurability or small-scale shear modulus in any direction, not to any rigidity or stiffness properties such as its bulk modulus or Young's modulus. Stiffness is often confused for hardness. Some materials are stiffer than diamond (e.g. osmium) but are not harder, and are prone to spalling and flaking in squamose or acicular habits.\n\nThe key to understanding the mechanism behind hardness is understanding the metallic microstructure, or the structure and arrangement of the atoms at the atomic level. In fact, most important metallic properties critical to the manufacturing of today’s goods are determined by the microstructure of a material. At the atomic level, the atoms in a metal are arranged in an orderly three-dimensional array called a crystal lattice. In reality, however, a given specimen of a metal likely never contains a consistent single crystal lattice. A given sample of metal will contain many grains, with each grain having a fairly consistent array pattern. At an even smaller scale, each grain contains irregularities.\n\nThere are two types of irregularities at the grain level of the microstructure that are responsible for the hardness of the material. These irregularities are point defects and line defects. A point defect is an irregularity located at a single lattice site inside of the overall three-dimensional lattice of the grain. There are three main point defects. If there is an atom missing from the array, a vacancy defect is formed. If there is a different type of atom at the lattice site that should normally be occupied by a metal atom, a substitutional defect is formed. If there exists an atom in a site where there should normally not be, an interstitial defect is formed. This is possible because space exists between atoms in a crystal lattice. While point defects are irregularities at a single site in the crystal lattice, line defects are irregularities on a plane of atoms. Dislocations are a type of line defect involving the misalignment of these planes. In the case of an edge dislocation, a half plane of atoms is wedged between two planes of atoms. In the case of a screw dislocation two planes of atoms are offset with a helical array running between them.\n\nIn glasses, hardness seems to depend linearly on the number of topological constraints acting between the atoms of the network. Hence, the rigidity theory has allowed predicting hardness values with respect to composition.\n\nDislocations provide a mechanism for planes of atoms to slip and thus a method for plastic or permanent deformation. Planes of atoms can flip from one side of the dislocation to the other effectively allowing the dislocation to traverse through the material and the material to deform permanently. The movement allowed by these dislocations causes a decrease in the material's hardness.\n\nThe way to inhibit the movement of planes of atoms, and thus make them harder, involves the interaction of dislocations with each other and interstitial atoms. When a dislocation intersects with a second dislocation, it can no longer traverse through the crystal lattice. The intersection of dislocations creates an anchor point and does not allow the planes of atoms to continue to slip over one another A dislocation can also be anchored by the interaction with interstitial atoms. If a dislocation comes in contact with two or more interstitial atoms, the slip of the planes will again be disrupted. The interstitial atoms create anchor points, or pinning points, in the same manner as intersecting dislocations.\n\nBy varying the presence of interstitial atoms and the density of dislocations, a particular metal's hardness can be controlled. Although seemingly counter-intuitive, as the density of dislocations increases, there are more intersections created and consequently more anchor points. Similarly, as more interstitial atoms are added, more pinning points that impede the movements of dislocations are formed. As a result, the more anchor points added, the harder the material will become.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Organized in the wake of the successful International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957-1958, the International Biological Program was an attempt to apply the methods of big science to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues.\n\nThe IBP was organized under the leadership of C. H. Waddington beginning in 1962 and officially started in 1964, with the goal of exploring \"The Biological Basis of Productivity and Human Welfare\". In its early years, Canadian and European ecologists were the main participants; by 1968, the United States also became heavily involved. However, unlike other more successful applications of the big science model of scientific research, the IBP lacked a clear, socially and scientifically pressing goal. Many biologists, particularly molecular biologists and evolutionary ecologists, were sharply critical of the IBP, which they viewed as throwing money at ill-defined or relatively unimportant problems and reducing the freedom of scientists to choose their own research projects.\n\nThe main results of the IBP were five biome studies, the largest of which were the Grassland Biome project and the Eastern Deciduous Forest Biome project (both of which had ties to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which provided tracer isotopes for nutrient- and energy-flow experiments). Though the impact of these studies was modest, the IBP marked a dramatic increase in the scale of funding for ecosystem ecology, which remained high (relative to earlier levels) even after the conclusion of the program in June 1974. Far more influential than any of the IBP biome studies was contemporary Hubbard Brook ecosystem study of 1963-1968, which—lacking the hierarchical organization of IBP projects—grew gradually according to individual scientists' interest and involved more informal collaboration.\n\nOne of the most influential IBP projects in Europe was the Solling Project in Lower Saxony (Germany), led by Heinz Ellenberg. Evidence from here proved decisive in the 1980s to track down Acid Rain as major cause of Forest Decline. \n\nIn tropical areas, the LAMTO project held by French professor Maxime Lamotte in Ivory Coast provided a thorough analysis of the savannah energy budget and a profound knowledge of almost all biodiversity present in this savannah.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known as the naturalist on James Cook's second Pacific voyage, where he was accompanied by his son Georg Forster. These expeditions promoted the career of Johann Reinhold Forster and the findings became the bedrock of colonial professionalism and helped set the stage for the future development of anthropology and ethnology. They also laid the framework for general concern about the impact that alteration of the physical environment for European economic expansion would have on exotic societies.\n\nForster's family originated in the Lords Forrester in Scotland from where his great-grandfather had emigrated after losing most of his property during the rule of Oliver Cromwell along with many other Scots. Forster himself was born in the city of Tczew (Dirschau), in the province of Royal Prussia, in the Crown of Poland. He studied languages and natural history at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin, theology at the University of Halle, afterwards serving as a Protestant pastor in Mokry Dwór (Nassenhuben) Pomeranian Voivodship. He married his cousin Elisabeth Nikolai. They had several children including a son, Georg Forster and a daughter Virginia Viktoria.\n\nIn 1765 he accepted an offer made to him by the Russian government to inspect and report upon the new colonies founded on the banks of the Volga, in the province of Saratov. His irritable temper soon involved him in difficulties with the Russian government, and in the following year he went with Georg (the eldest of eight children, seven of which survived childhood) to England and became teacher of natural history at Warrington, Lancashire.\n\nHe spent three years teaching at the Dissenting Warrington Academy, succeeding Joseph Priestley. Compelled by his violent temper to resign this appointment, Forster then moved with his son to London, where they earned a precarious living by doing translations. In 1771, he published \"A Catalogue of the Animals of North America\", which listed the region's mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, insects, arachnids, and crustaceans.\n\nWhen Joseph Banks withdrew at the last moment as naturalist on Cook's second voyage, Forster and his son were appointed to fill the vacant position. In July 1772 they set sail on the \"Resolution\", returning to England in July 1775. During a stop in Cape Town, Forster engaged Anders Sparrman to act as his assistant.\n\nBoth the Forsters kept detailed diaries of everything they saw on the voyage, and made extensive collections of both natural history specimens and artefacts. On his return Forster published \"Observations Made during a Voyage round the World\" (1778). However the income from the book was insufficient to clear his debts, and the bulk of Georg's drawings from the voyage had to be sold to Joseph Banks. During the next few years Forster undertook a variety of writing work, including a German translation of Thomas Pennant's \"Arctic Zoology\".\n\nIn November 1779 Forster was appointed Professor of Natural history and Mineralogy at the University of Halle, and director of the Botanische Garten der Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, where he remained until his death. His \"Descriptiones animalium\", completed within a month of returning to England with Cook, was eventually edited by Hinrich Lichtenstein and published in 1844.\n\nForster's contributions to the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\" (1772–73) on zoology, ornithology, and ichthyology established him as one of the earliest authorities on North American zoology.\n\n\n"}

The requirements grow increasingly stringent with the desired degree of vacuum achievable in the vacuum chamber.\nThe materials can produce gas by several mechanisms. Molecules of gases and water can be adsorbed on the material surface (therefore materials with low affinity to water have to be chosen, which eliminates many plastics). Materials may sublimate in vacuum (this includes some metals and their alloys, most notably cadmium and zinc). Or the gases can be released from porous materials or from cracks and crevices. Traces of lubricants, residues from machining, can be present on the surfaces. A specific risk is outgassing of solvents absorbed in plastics after cleaning.\n\nThe gases liberated from the materials not only lower the vacuum quality, but also can be reabsorbed on other surfaces, creating deposits and contaminating the chamber.\n\nYet another problem is diffusion of gases through the materials themselves. Atmospheric helium can diffuse even through Pyrex glass, even if slowly; this however is usually not an issue. Some materials might also expand or increase in size causing problems in delicate equipment.\n\nIn addition to the gas-related issues, the materials have to maintain adequate strength through the entire required temperature range (sometimes reaching cryogenic temperatures), maintain their properties (elasticity, plasticity, electrical and thermal conductivity or lack of it, etc.), be machinable, and if possible not be overly expensive. Yet another concern is the thermal expansion coefficient match of adjacent parts.\n\nMaterials outgas by three mechanisms: release of absorbed gases (desorption from the bulk of the material), release of adsorbed gases (desorption from the surface only), and evaporation of the material itself. The former can be reduced by a bakeout, the latter is an intrinsic property of the material. Some outgassed materials can deposit on other surfaces, contaminate the vacuum system and be difficult to get rid of.\n\nThe most common sources of trouble (out-gassing) in vacuum systems are:\n\n\n\n\nLubrication of moving parts is a problem for vacuum. Many lubricants have unacceptable outgassing rates, others (e.g. graphite) lose lubricating properties.\n\n\nIn addition to the concerns above, materials for use in spacecraft applications have to cope with radiation damage and high-intensity ultraviolet radiation, thermal loads from solar radiation, radiation cooling of the vehicle in other directions, and heat produced within the spacecraft's systems. Another concern, for orbits closer to Earth, is the presence of atomic oxygen, leading to corrosion of exposed surfaces; aluminium is an especially sensitive material. Silver, often used for surface-deposited interconnects, forms layer of silver oxide that flakes off and may erode up to a total failure.\n\nCorrosion-sensitive surfaces can be protected by a suitable plating, most often with gold; a silica layer is also possible. However the coating layer is subject to erosion by micrometeoroids.\n"}

The identification of Mount Judi as the landing site of the ark persisted in Syriac and Armenian tradition throughout Late Antiquity but was abandoned for the tradition equating the biblical location with the highest mountain of the region, Mount Ararat.\n\nJewish Babylonian, Syriac, and Islamic traditions identify Mount Judi or Qardu as a peak near the town of Jazirat ibn Umar (modern Cizre), at the headwaters of the Tigris, near the modern Syrian–Turkish border. Arab historian Al-Masudi (d. 956), reported that the spot where the ark came to rest could be seen in his time. Al-Masudi locates Jabal Judi at 80 parasangs from the Tigris.\n\nMount Judi was historically located in the province of Corduene, south of Lake Van.\n\nThe relation of some of the spellings is clear.\nThe origin of \"Judi\" is less clear. It is usually interpreted as a corrupted version of the same name, via \"al-gurdi\" (Reynolds 2004).\nThe proposal that the two names are ultimately the same was first advanced by the English Orientalist George Sale in his translation of the Qur'an published in 1734. Sale's footnote reads:\n\nSale goes on to say that there was once a famous Christian monastery on the mountain, but that this was destroyed by lightning in the year 776 AD, following which\n\nThe Syrians of the east Tigris had a legend of the ark resting on the \"Djûdi\" mountain in the land of Corduene (\"Kard\", \"Korchayk\", \"Carduchoi\"). This legend may in origin have been independent of the Genesis account of Noah's flood, rooted in the more general Near Eastern flood legends, but following Christianization of the Syrians, from about the 2nd century AD, it became associated with the Mountains of Ararat where Noah landed according to Genesis, and from Syria also this legend also spread to the Armenians. The Armenians did not traditionally associate Noah's landing site with Mount Ararat, known natively as \"Masis\", but until the 11th century continued to associate Noah's ark with Mount Judi.\n\nIt is to be noted, the biblical \"Ararat\" is thought be a variation of \"Urartu\", an ancient term for the region north of ancient Assyria which encompasses the Armenian plateau. \n\nAccording to Josephus, the Armenians in the 1st century showed the remains of Noah's ark at a place called αποβατηριον \"Place of Descent\" (, \"Nakhichevan\", Ptolemy's Ναξουανα), about 60 miles southeast of the summit of Mount Ararat (ca. ). \n\nThe \"mountains of Ararat\" in Genesis have become identified in later (medieval) Christian tradition with the peak now known as Mount Ararat itself, a volcanic massif on the border between Turkey and Armenia and known in Turkish as \"Agri Dagh\" (Ağrı Dağı).\n\nThe Quranic account of the Flood and Noah's Ark agrees with that given in Genesis, with a few variations. One of these concerns the final resting place of the Ark: according to Genesis, the Ark grounded on the \"mountains of Ararat\". According to \"Surah\" 11:44 of the Qur'an, the final resting place of the vessel was called \"Judi\", without the word \"mountain\". However, the use of Arabic definite letter \"Al\" in front of word Judi in the Quran signifies that it is pointing to a definite place (or mountain, in this case). Has it been referring to a general height, it would have been just \"Judi\", not \"Al-Judi\". §\n\nThe 9th century Arab geographer Ibn Khordadbih identified the location of mount Judi as being in the land of Assyria (\"Al-Akrad\"), and the Abbasid historian Abu al-Hasan 'Alī al-Mas'ūdī (c. 896-956) recorded that the spot where it came to rest could be seen in his time. Masudi also said that the Ark began its voyage at Kufa in central Iraq, and sailed to Mecca, where it circled the Kaaba, before finally travelling to Judi. Yaqut al-Hamawi, also known as Al-Rumi, placed the mountain \"above Jazirat ibn Umar, to the east of the Tigris\" and mentioned a mosque built by Noah that could be seen in his day, and the traveller Ibn Battuta passed by the mountain in the 14th century.\n\nIn the 1980s, adventurer and self-styled archaeologist Ron Wyatt and his colleague David Fasold claimed to have discovered Noah's Ark at Durupınar, some twenty miles from Mt. Ararat near a mountain locals called \"Cudi Dağı\". Fasold later vacillated on the claim.\n\nThe description of medieval geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi matches exactly a 2089 m peak north of Silopi, that is now called \"Jabal Judi\" or \"Judi Dagh\" by Muslims and \"Gardu\" by Christians and Jews.\n"}
{"id": "1182980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1182980", "title": "Mountain formation", "text": "Mountain formation\n\nMountain formation refers to the geological processes that underlie the formation of mountains. These processes are associated with large-scale movements of the Earth's crust (tectonic plates). Folding, faulting, volcanic activity, igneous intrusion and metamorphism can all be parts of the orogenic process of mountain building. The formation of mountains is not necessarily related to the geological structures found on it.\n\nThe understanding of specific landscape features in terms of the underlying tectonic processes is called \"tectonic geomorphology\", and the study of geologically young or ongoing processes is called \"neotectonics\".\n\nFrom the late 18th century until its replacement by plate tectonics in the 1960s geosyncline theory was used to explain much mountain-building.\n\nThere are four main types of mountains: volcanic, fold,residual, and block. A more detailed classification useful on a local scale predates plate tectonics and adds to these categories.\n\nMovements of tectonic plates create volcanoes along the plate boundaries, which erupt and form mountains. A \"volcanic arc system\" is a series of volcanoes that form near a subduction zone where the crust of a sinking oceanic plate melts and drags water down with the subducting crust.\n\nMost volcanoes occur in a band encircling the Pacific Ocean (the Pacific Ring of Fire), and in another that extends from the Mediterranean across Asia to join the Pacific band in the Indonesian Archipelago. The most important types of volcanic mountain are \"composite cones\" or \"stratovolcanoes\" (Vesuvius, Kilimanjaro and Mount Fuji are examples) and \"shield volcanoes\" (such as Mauna Loa on Hawaii, a hotspot volcano).\n\nA shield volcano has a gently sloping cone due to the low viscosity of the emitted material, primarily basalt. Mauna Loa is the classic example, with a slope of 4°-6°. (The relation between slope and viscosity falls under the topic of angle of repose.) The composite volcano or stratovolcano has a more steeply rising cone (33°-40°), due to the higher viscosity of the emitted material, and eruptions are more violent and less frequent than for shield volcanoes. Besides the examples already mentioned are Mount Shasta, Mount Hood and Mount Rainier.\n\nWhen plates collide or undergo subduction (that is – ride one over another), the plates tend to buckle and fold, forming mountains. Most of the major continental mountain ranges are associated with thrusting and folding or orogenesis. Examples are the Jura and the Zagros mountains.\n\nWhen a fault block is raised or tilted, block mountains can result. Higher blocks are called \"horsts\" and troughs are called \"grabens\". A spreading apart of the surface causes tensional forces. When the tensional forces are strong enough to cause a plate to split apart, it does so such that a center block drops down relative to its flanking blocks.\n\nAn example of this is the Sierra Nevada Range, where delamination created a block 650 km long and 80 km wide that consists of many individual portions tipped gently west, with east facing slips rising abruptly to produce the highest mountain front in the continental United States.\n\nUnlike orogenic mountains there is no widely accepted geophysical model that explains elevated passive continental margins such as the Scandinavian Mountains, Eastern Greenland, the Brazilian Highlands or Australia's Great Dividing Range.\nDifferent elevated passive continental margins most likely share the same mechanism of uplift. This mechanism is possibly related to far-field stresses in Earth’s lithosphere. According to this view elevated passived margins can be likened to giant anticlinal lithospheric folds, where folding is caused by horizontal compression acting on a thin to thick crust transition zone (as are all passive margins).\n\nResidual mountains are formed as a result of erosion of an existing elevated area. They are also called mountains of denudation. \n\nExamples in Europe include:\nthe Scottish Highlands, the Scandinavian Mountains, and Snowdonia in Wales.\n\nExamples in India include: the Aravalli Range, the Nilgiri Mountains in Tamilnadu, the Rajmahal Hills, and the Eastern and Western Ghats.\n\nHotspots are supplied by a magma source in the Earth's mantle called a mantle plume. Although originally attributed to a melting of subducted oceanic crust, recent evidence belies this connection. The mechanism for plume formation remains a research topic.\n\nSeveral movements of the earth's crust that lead to mountains are associated with faults. These movements actually are amenable to analysis that can predict, for example, the height of a raised block and the width of an intervening rift between blocks using the rheology of the layers and the forces of isostasy. Early bent plate models predicting fractures and fault movements have evolved into today's kinematic and flexural models.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32684041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32684041", "title": "Pacific Equatorial Forest", "text": "Pacific Equatorial Forest\n\nThe Pacific Equatorial Forest is a tropical forest ecosystem located at 0° latitude in coastal Ecuador, in the province of Manabí. The ecosystem is most notable for its high diversity of forest types unusually close in proximity. Tropical rainforest, moist evergreen forest, premontane cloud forest, and tropical deciduous forest can all be encountered over the course of a one-day hike, and the change from one type of forest to another can occur in as little as 100 meters. \n\nThe Pacific Equatorial Forests, along with the rest of the coastal forests of Ecuador, is considered the most threatened tropical forest in the world and is part of the Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena biodiversity hotspot. As much as 98% of coastal tropical forest have already been lost in Ecuador, almost all occurring during the last three generations. The Pacific Equatorial Forest, in particular, represents the greatest concentration of unprotected forest in coastal Ecuador and has been designated by several international conservation organizations as a global conservation priority.\n\nThe Pacific Equatorial Forests is bound by the shores of the Pacific Ocean to the west and the peaks of the long and narrow Jama-Coaque Coastal Mountain Range, which stretches along the coast at an average distance of 10 km inland. The Pacific Equatorial Forest extends as far south as Cabo Posado, at 0 degrees and 22 minutes south of the equator, and as far north as Pedernales, at 0 degrees and 3 minutes north of the equator. However, patches of the ecosystem can be found as far north as Punta Tortuga and Galera at 0 degrees and 46 minutes north of the equator. \n\nThe core area of the Pacific Equatorial Forest covers two counties, Jama and Pedernales, in the northwest of the province of Manabí in Ecuador. The Jama-Coaque mountains (pronounced \"Hama Ko-Ah-Kay\") takes its name from the ancient civilization that thrived in the region from 355 B.C. to 1532 A.D; whose territory is believed to have been limited to this specific ecosystem and the adjacent coastline. The Pacific Equatorial Forest covers 650 square kilometres, or 65,000 hectares of land, of which approximately 19,000 hectares are still forested.\n\nThe Pacific Equatorial Forest is subject to what is known as a tropical monsoon climate. The ecosystem is located directly adjacent to the changeover from the cold and dry Humboldt ocean current from southern Chile and the warm El Niño ocean current (also known as the Equatorial Counter Current) from Panama. The cold water and air temperatures associated with the Humboldt Current inhibit rainfall in southern coastal Ecuador and Peru, creating dry to arid conditions, whereas the warm temperaturas associated with the El Nino current create humid conditions with high rainfall in northern Ecuador and coastal Colombia. \n\nFor its location at the confluence of these two ocean currents, the Pacific Equatorial Forest is a transition zone between the wettest forests (the Chocó in Colombia) and the driest desert (the Atacama in Peru) recorded on earth. This complex climatological effect is multiplied by the Jama-Coaque Coastal Mountain Range, whose sharp changes in altitude so close to the ocean account for wide variations in precipitation in very small expanses of land. The mountains rise to 845 metres (2,772 feet) above sea level at the highest peak, although the rest of the mountain range is a series of peaks that average 500–650 metres (1,640-2,132 feet) of altitude, which are shrouded in fog most of the year. \n\nStarting in late December, a change in atmospheric pressure shifts ocean currents so that warm waters come closer to shore and displace the cold waters. During this time, air and water temperatures, tides, sea levels and wave heights, and relative humidity all rise. These conditions produce heavy rainfall that used to last through August, but now usually only lasts into May. Rain during the rainy season is punctuated by sunny weather. \n\nThe dry season, which now begins in June or July and lasts sometimes into mid January, is characterized by cooler temperatures and more overcast skies. The Bamboo House research station in the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve has recorded an average daily temperature range of 24-31° Celsius (75-88° Fahrenheit) in the rainy season, and 19-29° Celsius (66-84° Fahrenheit) in the dry season. Throughout the entire coast of Ecuador, annual precipitation varies widely according to latitude, with as much as 8,000 mm of rain in the extreme north, close to the Colombian border, to as little as 300 mm in the extreme south, close to the Peruvian border. \n\nIn the Pacific Equatorial Forest, which is located in between these two extremes, precipitation primarily varies according to elevation and proximity to the ocean. In the premontane cloud forest along the peaks of the coastal mountains, which strip wáter from the nearly constant cloud cover, annual precipitation is 2,000-3,000 mm, and the vegetation is green and lush year-round. Along the shoreline, annual rainfall can be as little as 800 mm, and in these much drier conditions the majority of trees shed their leaves during the dry season, creating tropical deciduous forest (also known as tropical dry forest).\n\nThe Pacific Equatorial Forest provides habitat for serves as habitat and key migratory channel for two endangered species of primates; the (mantled howler monkey and white-fronted capuchin monkey)and six endangered species of felines, the (jaguar, puma, ocelot, oncilla, margay and jaguarundi). Other endangered mammals include the tayra, the three-toed sloth, the western agouti, and the spotted paca. \n\nEndemic and/or rare species of birds include the Red-Masked Parakeet, Pale-browed Tinamou, Pacific Pygmy Owl, Esmeralda Woodstar hummingbird, Gray-backed Hawk, Guayaquil Woodpecker, Pacific Royal-Flycatcher, Plumbeous Kite, Rufous-headed Chachalaca, and the Chocó Toucan. \n\nIn 2009, herpetologist Paul S. Hamilton discovered thirty new species of frog and one new species of snake in three remnants of Pacific Equatorial Forest (Lalo Loor Dry Forest Reserve, Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve, and Cerro Pata de Pajaro).\n\nThe primary cause of deforestation in the region is the conversion of native forest into cattle pasture, a process which is aided by illegal logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. The deforestation figure in all of coastal Ecuador is 98%. The Pacific Equatorial Forest, which has suffered an estimated loss of 75% of its native forest, has thus fared somewhat better than the rest of the region owing to its limited access and more challenging topography. However, the construction of a new coastal highway through the region threatens to facilitate the deforestation of the last remnants of Pacific Equatorial Forest. \n\nIn 2001, the Centro de Investigación de Bosques Tropicales (Tropical Forest Research Center) reported: \"Due to the high rate of endemism, the mass elimination of forest habitat in the Coastal region over the last half-century represents one of the greatest species extinction events in history.\" The human consequences of regional deforestation have likewise been significant. The dramatic loss of forest cover over the last 50 years has altered the rain cycle and caused a sharp decline in regional precipitation. \n\nWhereas three generations ago the rainy season lasted eight months per year and the dry season four, that ratio has inverted, and now the rainy season barely lasts four months, followed by eight months of drought. Rivers that used to be viable year-round now run dry half of the year, crops fail, and droughts result in high death rates of livestock, an effect which is particularly acute during periods of theLa Nina ocean-atmosphere phenomenon.\n\nThere are three small ecological reserves that protect remnants of the Pacific Equatorial Forest: Cerro Pata de Pajaro (Fundación Tercer Mundo), the Lalo Loor Dry Forest Reserve (Ceiba Foundation) and the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve (Third Millennium Alliance), which protect 1,000 acres, 500 acres, and 1250 acres respectively. \n\nThe Three Forest Trail, established in 2010, is a 25-km-long trail that connects the dry forest of the Lalo Loor Dry Forest Reserve with the rainforest of the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve via the cloud-forested mountain ridges. The trail is meant to function as an incentive for conservation, as all forest owners along the trail receive a percentage of the trail fees. \n\nHowever, the vast majority of the Pacific Equatorial Forest remains unprotected and continue to be logged and cleared for agriculture and cattle ranching. In 2009 the Ecuadorian Ministry of the Environment launched its \"Socio Bosque\" (Forest Partners) program, which provides forest owners with an annual conservation subsidy of $30 per hectare ($12/acre), has had some traction in the region but the long-term efficacy is still uncertain.\n"}

They have various names in English including the Honorable Water Immortal Kings and the Gods of the Waters. Their worship seems to derive from a misunderstanding of one of Wu Zixu's religious titles. They are believed to protect vessels in transit.\n\nThe Chinese title \"Shuǐxiān Zūnwáng\" is variously translated into English as the the Illustrious, Revered, or Eminent , the the the and the \n\nThe head of the five is Yu the Great, the legendary first emperor of the Xia Dynasty in prehistoric China. Within China, the Xia are now generally associated with the historical Erlitou culture along the Wei and middle Yellow Rivers, while foreign scholarship often continues to dismiss it as legendary. Yu became regarded as a water deity through his involvement with controlling the Great Flood of Chinese myth, which may have preserved aspects of the Yellow River's massive flooding . As Chinese generally fails to distinguish between singular and plural nouns, \"zūnwáng\" is sometimes considered to refer to a single Illustrious King. In such cases, it is usually identified with Yu alone.\n\nThe existence of a quintet of gods, however, is thought to derive from a misunderstanding of Wu Zixu's surname (\"Wǔ\") as intending its usual sense as a synonym for the Chinese word for \"five\" (, \"wǔ\") in its appearance in his divine title \"King Wu\" (, \"Wǔwáng\").\n\nWu Zixu was a Chu noble who was forced into exile in Wu. There, he helped the prince Ji Guang assassinate the king and enthrone himself as King Helü. He then played a role in Wu's invasion of his homeland, exhuming the corpse of its former king to punish it for the earlier death of his father and brother. He accurately predicted that Yue would endanger Wu but did not have the ear of Helü's successor Fuchai. He was forced to commit suicide; his body placed in a leather bag and then thrown into a river. After the fall of Wu, Wu Zixu's spirit was worshipped as Taoshen, \"God of the Waves\", and particularly as the god of the Qiantang Tidal Bore at Hangzhou. Wu Zixu had also been involved with the urban planning of King Helü's capital at Suzhou and is sometimes considered a culture hero credited with inventing the waterwheel.\n\nXiang Yu, the \"warlord of western Chu\" whose revolt ended the Qin Empire in 206, was killed fighting the forces of Han beside the Wu River in Anhui in 202. He is usually said to have slit his throat and had his body torn to pieces by his enemies, but he became regarded as a water deity from a separate legend that his body miraculously remained standing in the waters of the Wu after his suicide.\n\nQu Yuan was a poet and advisor to his relative the king of Chu. He was exiled upon supposedly slanderous reports of his fellow courtiers and committed suicide by walking into the Miluo while holding a rock, out of frustration with either his exile or with the direction of Chu's public policy. His memory is honored at Duanwu by various the traditions of the Dragon Boat Festival, although some believe this to have been a misplaced bit of Wu Zixu's legacy.\n\nThe fifth figure variously appears as \"King\"Ao \"Àowáng\") or as the inventor Lu Ban.\n\nThe \"King\" Ao—literally the \"Arrogant King\"—is the deified form of Ao (, \"Ào\") or Jiao (, \"Jiāo\"), the preternaturally strong son of Han Zhuo, the advisor who usurped the realm of the archer Houyi in the 8th year of the reign of the Xia king Xiang. Ao is said to have conquered the state of Ge for his father during the same year. He became regarded as a water deity through his supposed role as the inventor of ships, which he was said to be able to sail across land as well as water. He was killed by Xiang's son .\n\nLu Ban, also known by his Cantonese name Lo Pan, was a woodworker at the end of the Spring and Autumn Period who became revered as the Chinese god of carpentry and masonry. The great demand for his work during his life supposedly compelled him to invent or improve a number of carpenter's tools—the saw, the square, the planer, the drill, the shovel, and an ink marking tool—to complete his many projects more quickly.\n\nThe worship of the Shuixian Zunwang as a quintet of kings appears to derive from a misunderstanding of one of Wu Zixu's religious titles. (Chinese generally lacks plural noun forms and his surname is a variant of the Chinese word for \"five\".) The honorable kings of the water immortals were first worshipped around Xiamen, which became a stronghold for Ming loyalists during the Qing conquest of China. Under Koxinga, the Zheng dynasty defeated the Dutch on Taiwan and moved from a base at Xiamen to the area around Tainan, which they ruled as the Kingdom of Tungning. They appear to have been responsible for the introduction of the worship of Fujian's five kings there.\n\nThe Shuixian Zunwang are worshipped as protectors of ships in transit. A shrine in their honor was included on most Taiwanese vessels during the imperial era; even today, most Taiwanese harbors include temples to them. Their shrines also appear in Mazuist temples.\n\n"}

In 2010, 70 percent of the country's electricity generation came from coal-fired power plants, but the Chinese government is investing heavily in renewable energy technologies. As of 2013, 21 percent of China's electricity generation comes from renewable sources. This represents only 9 percent of overall primary energy consumption in the country. China's latest goal is to increase renewable energy to 9.5 percent of overall primary energy use by 2015. To implement China's new clean energy capacity into the national power grid, and to improve the reliability of the country's existing infrastructure, requires significant upgrades and ultimately, a smart grid.\nA smart grid differs from a conventional power grid in that it includes a system of information and communication technologies to bidirectionally transmit and distribute electricity more efficiently and reliably. Additionally, this technology allows consumers to manage their power usage and make choices for economically efficient products and services. China's national utility, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), is responsible for the oversight of these upgrades.\n\nChina's national utility, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), announced plans to invest $250 billion in electric power infrastructure upgrades over the next five years, of which $45 billion is earmarked for smart grid technologies. Another $240 billion between 2016 and 2020 will be added to complete the smart grid project. .\n\n• Set technical and management standards\n\n• Develop technology and equipment\n\n• Set development plans and initiate pilot projects\n\n• Specifically, in 2010, China plans to start construction on the \"Two Vertical, Two Horizontal\" plan and reach interregional transmission capability of 12.9 GW by the end of the year.\n\n• Construct UHV grid and urban-rural distribution grid\n\n• Construct smart grid operation/control and interactive service system\n\n• Key technological breakthroughs and their applications\n\n• By 2015, UHV and other intra-regional transmission capacity will be 240 GW. Distribution and power provision will reach a reliability rate of 99.915% or higher in the cities and 99.73% or higher in rural areas. Smart meters will be in widespread use and EV charging stations will have been deployed in numbers that will satisfy demand\n\n• Complete a strong, smart grid\n\n• Become world leaders in management, technology and equipment\n\n• By 2020, UHV and other intra-regional transmission capacity will reach 400 GW, enough to connect all planned coal, hydro, nuclear and wind power to areas with high demand\n\nDuring 2011 SGCC took bids for 44 million smart meter units. In total, 65 companies received bids for smart meters from SGCC. The total smart meter market in China is estimated to be 330 million smart meter units worth approximately US$7.7 billion. By 2011, SGCC had deployed 45 million smart meter units. All SGCC users are expected to be equipped with smart meters by 2014. \n\n\nIn December 2011 construction on battery energy storage station residing in Zhangbei, Hebei Province was completed by BYD and SGCC. The storage station is capable of storing 36 MWh of energy in a series of lithium iron-phosphate batteries approximately the size of a football field. Designed to be implemented in conjunction with a 140 MW expansion of renewable energy (solar and wind), this project is worth over US$500 million.\n\nThe first digital substation was built in China in 2006. By 2009 China had implemented more than 70 digital substations. The implementation of digital substations is critical to the smart grid because of it allows for processing of energy generated from conventional and renewable sources, protects the grid from attack, and communicates with the rest of the grid.\n\nFor flexible power transmission in the grid, substantial infrastructure upgrades must be made to the existing power grid. This is primarily being done by upgrading the existing power grid to a system capable of transmitting ultra high voltage AC and ultra high voltage DC power. Over half of China's investment in flexible power transmission is in the form of static VAR compensators or SVCs. In 2009, SGCC announced its plan to invest approximately 88 billion dollars in ultra high voltage equipment.\n\nIn August 2009 SGCC established its first commercially available electric vehicle charging station, the Caoxi Electrical Vehicle Charging Station. As of 2010, 76 electric vehicle charging stations have been built in 41 Chinese cities. Continued investment in electric car infrastructure reflects the country's goal of having 500,000 electric, hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles on the road by 2015 and 5 million by 2020.\n\nIn September 2011, SGCC announced plans to invest $250 billion in electric power infrastructure upgrades over the next five years, of which $45 billion is earmarked for smart grid technologies. Another $240 billion between 2016 and 2020 will be added to complete the smart grid project.\n\nIn 2012, China’s Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) signed an agreement with the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to deploy its first demand response pilot project. Honeywell was selected in 2011 to develop the smart grid project and implement its automated demand response (ADR) technology to temporarily decrease energy use in commercial and industrial facilities. The reduction is triggered when citywide consumption peaks and threatens to outpace the ability to produce power, which creates instability, and the potential for brownouts and blackouts. The project is part of a grant agreement between the State Grid Electric Power Research Institute (SGEPRI), a subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China, and the USTDA.\n\nAuto DR looks at energy use as a dynamic variable in balancing supply and demand. Implementation of the Honeywell pilot project gave SGCC the latest technologies and perspective on how to realize the benefits of demand response. China is the World's largest Transmission and Distribution market with capital expenditures on power lines growing at an annual rate of 15 to 20 percent until 2018. With this level of investment, US companies can test and commercialize technology in China at a faster and larger scale than in other parts of the World, including developed countries. \n\nThe agencies involved in the ADR pilot deemed it a success and the technology is now being implemented in other parts of China, including Shanghai. The results of the program showed that \"the industrial site’s load reduction varied with production schedule. The site saw a reduction of 7.7 percent during full production periods. When not operating at full production, the site’s demand response shed capacity increased more than 30 percent. The two commercial buildings provided a more stable and consistent load shed response, shedding between 15 and 20 percent.\"\n\nAccording to the Chinese authorities a strong and robust smart grid market would total $20 billion annually by 2015. Rolling out Ultra-High Voltage (UHV) transmission systems would account for more than 60% of that market, while smart meters and wind power connectivity could reach $2 billion and $800 million annually respectively.\n\nSGCC has implemented these smart grid technologies in areas such as Liangjiang, with the project there passing inspection in Q3 of 2014. It currently comprises one 220 kV substation and seven 110 kV substations. SGCC also launched the first UHV power grid in Tianjin in November 2014. The project calls for 290 transmission towers to be built, with 22 of those already constructed. Tianjin currently imports 20 percent of its electricity, and this project will increase that total to 30 percent with an estimated additional capacity of 5 million KW. Tianjin’s maximum voltage will also double, from 500 kV to 1000 kV, all while reducing coal consumption by 9 million tons, as well as reducing carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide emissions.\n\nIn March 2014, the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) approached SGCC for a technical partnership and expertise to help the Philippines in their smart grid pilot project in Antipolo.\n"}

The approach can be seen as a development of the distributed generation concept.\n\nSuch systems are based on a combination of district heating, district cooling, plus 'electricity generation islands' that are interlinked via a private wire electricity system (largely bypassing the normal power grid to cut transmission losses and charges, as well as increasing the robustness of the system). The surplus from one generating island can therefore be used to make up the deficit at another.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the first sustainable community energy system was pioneered by Woking Borough Council, starting in 1991. The system uses traditional and a phosphoric acid fuel cell co-generation plants, thermal storage, heat fired absorption cooling and photovoltaics (over 9% of the UK's small capacity), to supply both residential and non-residential customers, as well as the Council's own facilities. By end of 2005 there were over 60 generating islands in the Borough.\n\nDespite the investment in the plant, the system delivers cheaper energy than can be supplied from the traditional 'brown energy' suppliers, helping to tackle fuel poverty. It is part of a plan to cut local carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050. Their initiatives won the Council the Queen's Award for Enterprise in 2002 .\n\nThe London Climate Change Agency is starting to construct a similar system in London.\n\nIn 1997, people of Wildpoldsried, in some cases acting as individuals, began a series of projects that produce renewable energy. The first efforts were wind turbines and biomass digesters for cogeneration of heat and power. In the time since, new work has included a number of energy conservation projects, more wind and biomass use, small hydro plants, photovoltaic panels on private houses, and district heating. Tied to this are ecological flood control and wastewater systems.\n\nToday, the effects of this are an unforeseen level of prosperity resulting in construction of nine new community buildings, including a school, gymnasium, and community hall, complete with solar panels. There are three companies operating four biogas digesters with a fifth under construction. There are seven windmills with two more on the way. One hundred and ninety private households are equipped with solar, which pays them dividends. The district heating network has 42 connections. There are three small hydro power plants. Wildpoldsried now produces 321 percent more energy than it needs and is generating 4.0 million Euro in annual revenue. At the same time, there has been a 65% reduction in the town’s carbon footprint.\n\n\n"}

They usually contain centres of chalcedony which may have been fractured followed by deposition of agate, jasper or opal, either uniquely or in combination. Also frequently encountered are quartz and gypsum crystals, as well as various other mineral growths and inclusions. Thundereggs usually look like ordinary rocks on the outside, but slicing them in half and polishing them may reveal intricate patterns and colours. A characteristic feature of thundereggs is that (like other agates) the individual beds they come from can vary in appearance, though they can maintain a certain specific identity within them. \n\nThunderegg is not synonymous with either geode or agate. A geode is a simple term for a rock with a hollow in it, often with crystal formation/growth. A thunderegg on the other hand is a specific geological structure. A thunderegg may be referred to as a geode if it has a hollow in it (see illustration of Gehlberg specimen), but not all geodes are thundereggs because there are many different ways for a hollow to form. Similarly, a thunderegg is just one of the forms that agate can assume.\n\nThundereggs are found globally where conditions are optimal. In the US, Oregon is one of the most famous thunderegg locations. Germany is also an important center for thunderegg agates (especially sites like St Egidien and Gehlberg). Other places known for thundereggs include Ethiopia, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Mexico, Argentina, Canada, Mount Hay and Tamborine Mountain, (Australia) and the Esterel massif, (France).\n\nThundereggs are found in flows of rhyolite lava. They form in gas pockets in the lava, which act as molds, from the action of water percolating through the porous rock carrying silica in solution. The deposits lined and filled the cavity, first with a darker matrix material, then an inner core of agate or chalcedony. The various colors come from differences in the minerals found in the soil and rock that the water has moved through.\n\nOn March 30, 1965, the thunderegg was designated as the Oregon state rock by a joint resolution of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. While thundereggs can be collected all over Oregon, the largest deposits are found in Crook, Jefferson, Malheur, Wasco and Wheeler counties. The world’s largest thunderegg, a 1.75 ton specimen, is housed by the Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals in Oregon.\n\nNative American legend reportedly considers the rocks to be the eggs of the thunderbirds which occupied Mount Hood and Mount Jefferson (Oregon). Thunder Spirits on the mountains hurled the \"eggs\" at each other.\n\n\n"}
