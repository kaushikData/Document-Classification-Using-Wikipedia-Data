{"id": "18932702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18932702", "title": "Alan Moore", "text": "Alan Moore\n\nAlan Moore (born 18 November 1953) is an English writer known primarily for his work in comic books including \"Watchmen\", \"V for Vendetta\", \"The Ballad of Halo Jones\" and \"From Hell\". Regarded by some as the best graphic novel writer in history, he is widely recognised among his peers and critics. He has occasionally used such pseudonyms as Curt Vile, Jill de Ray, and Translucia Baboon; also, reprints of some of his work have been credited to The Original Writer when Moore requested that his name be removed.\n\nMoore started writing for British underground and alternative fanzines in the late 1970s before achieving success publishing comic strips in such magazines as \"2000 AD\" and \"Warrior\". He was subsequently picked up by the American DC Comics, and as \"the first comics writer living in Britain to do prominent work in America\", he worked on major characters such as Batman (\"\") and Superman (\"\"), substantially developed the character Swamp Thing, and penned original titles such as \"Watchmen\". During that decade, Moore helped to bring about greater social respectability for comics in the United States and United Kingdom. He prefers the term \"comic\" to \"graphic novel\". In the late 1980s and early 1990s he left the comic industry mainstream and went independent for a while, working on experimental work such as the epic \"From Hell\" and the prose novel \"Voice of the Fire\". He subsequently returned to the mainstream later in the 1990s, working for Image Comics, before developing America's Best Comics, an imprint through which he published works such as \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" and the occult-based \"Promethea\".\n\nMoore is an occultist, ceremonial magician, and anarchist, and has featured such themes in works including \"Promethea\", \"From Hell\", and \"V for Vendetta\", as well as performing avant-garde spoken word occult \"workings\" with The Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels, some of which have been released on CD.\n\nDespite his own personal objections, his works have provided the basis for a number of Hollywood films, including \"From Hell\" (2001), \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" (2003), \"V for Vendetta\" (2005), and \"Watchmen\" (2009). Moore has also been referenced in popular culture, and has been recognised as an influence on a variety of literary and television figures including Neil Gaiman, Joss Whedon, and Damon Lindelof. He has lived a significant portion of his life in Northampton, England, and he has said in various interviews that his stories draw heavily from his experiences living there.\n\nMoore was born on 18 November 1953, at St Edmund's Hospital in Northampton to a working-class family who he believed had lived in the town for several generations. He grew up in a part of Northampton known as The Boroughs, a poverty-stricken area with a lack of facilities and high levels of illiteracy, but he nonetheless \"loved it. I loved the people. I loved the community and ... I didn't know that there was anything else.\" He lived in his house with his parents, brewery worker Ernest Moore, and printer Sylvia Doreen, with his younger brother Mike and his maternal grandmother. He \"read omnivorously\" from the age of five, getting books out of the local library, and subsequently attended Spring Lane Primary School. At the same time, he began reading comic strips, initially British strips, such as \"Topper\" and \"The Beezer\", but eventually also American imports such as \"The Flash\", \"Detective Comics\", \"Fantastic Four\", and \"Blackhawk\". He later passed his 11-plus exam, and was therefore eligible to go to Northampton Grammar School, where he first came into contact with people who were middle class and better educated, and he was shocked at how he went from being one of the top pupils at his primary school to one of the lowest in the class at secondary. Subsequently, disliking school and having \"no interest in academic study\", he believed that there was a \"covert curriculum\" being taught that was designed to indoctrinate children with \"punctuality, obedience and the acceptance of monotony\".\n\nIn the late 1960s Moore began publishing his own poetry and essays in fanzines, eventually setting up his own fanzine, \"Embryo\". Through \"Embryo\", Moore became involved in a group known as the Northampton Arts Lab. The Arts Lab subsequently made significant contributions to the magazine. He began dealing the hallucinogenic LSD at school, being expelled for doing so in 1970 – he later described himself as \"one of the world's most inept LSD dealers\". The headmaster of the school subsequently \"got in touch with various other academic establishments that I'd applied to and told them not to accept me because I was a danger to the moral well-being of the rest of the students there, which was possibly true.\"\n\nWhilst continuing to live in his parents' home for a few more years, he moved through various jobs, including cleaning toilets and working in a tannery. In late 1973, he met and began a relationship with Northampton-born Phyllis Dixon, with whom he moved into \"a little one-room flat in the Barrack Road area in Northampton\". Soon marrying, they moved into a new council estate in the town's eastern district while he worked in an office for a sub-contractor of the local gas board. Moore felt that he was not being fulfilled by this job, and so decided to try to earn a living doing something more artistic.\n\nAbandoning his office job, he decided to instead take up both writing and illustrating his own comics. He had already produced a couple of strips for several alternative fanzines and magazines, such as \"Anon E. Mouse\" for the local paper \"Anon\", and \"St. Pancras Panda\", a parody of Paddington Bear, for the Oxford-based \"Back Street Bugle\". His first paid work was for a few drawings that were printed in \"NME\", and not long after he succeeded in getting a series about a private detective known as \"Roscoe Moscow\" published using the pseudonym of Curt Vile (a pun on the name of composer Kurt Weill) in the weekly music magazine \"Sounds\", earning £35 a week. Alongside this, he and Phyllis, with their newborn daughter Leah, began claiming unemployment benefit to supplement this income. Not long after this, in 1979 he also began publishing a new comic strip known as \"Maxwell the Magic Cat\" in the \"Northants Post\", under the pseudonym of Jill de Ray (a pun on the Medieval child murderer Gilles de Rais, something he found to be a \"sardonic joke\"). Earning a further £10 a week from this, he decided to sign off of social security, and would continue writing \"Maxwell the Magic Cat\" until 1986. Moore has stated that he would have been happy to continue Maxwell's adventures almost indefinitely, but ended the strip after the newspaper ran a negative editorial on the place of homosexuals in the community. Meanwhile, Moore decided to focus more fully on writing comics rather than both writing and drawing them, stating that \"After I'd been doing [it] for a couple of years, I realised that I would never be able to draw well enough and/or quickly enough to actually make any kind of decent living as an artist.\"\n\nTo learn more about how to write a successful comic-book script, he asked advice from his friend, comic-book writer Steve Moore, whom he had known since he was fourteen. Interested in writing for \"2000AD\", one of Britain's most prominent comic magazines, Alan Moore then submitted a script for their long running and successful series \"Judge Dredd\". While having no need for another writer on \"Judge Dredd\", which was already being written by John Wagner, \"2000AD\"'s editor Alan Grant saw promise in Moore's work – later remarking that \"this guy's a really fucking good writer\" – and instead asked him to write some short stories for the publication's \"Future Shocks\" series. While the first few were rejected, Grant advised Moore on improvements, and eventually accepted the first of many. Meanwhile, Moore had also begun writing minor stories for \"Doctor Who Weekly\", and later commented that \"I really, really wanted a regular strip. I didn't want to do short stories ... But that wasn't what was being offered. I was being offered short four or five-page stories where everything had to be done in those five pages. And, looking back, it was the best possible education that I could have had in how to construct a story.\"\n\nFrom 1980 through to 1984, Moore maintained his status as a freelance writer, and was offered a spate of work by a variety of comic book companies in Britain, namely Marvel UK, and the publishers of \"2000AD\" and \"Warrior\". He later remarked that \"I remember that what was generally happening was that everybody wanted to give me work, for fear that I would just be given other work by their rivals. So everybody was offering me things.\" It was an era when comic books were increasing in popularity in Britain, and according to Lance Parkin, \"the British comics scene was cohering as never before, and it was clear that the audience was sticking with the title as they grew up. Comics were no longer just for very small boys: teenagers – even A-level and university students – were reading them now.\"\n\nDuring this three-year period, \"2000AD\" would accept and publish over fifty of Moore's one-off stories for their \"Future Shocks\" and \"Time Twisters\" science fiction series. The editors at the magazine were impressed by Moore's work and decided to offer him a more permanent strip, starting with a story that they wanted to be vaguely based upon the hit film \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\". The result, \"Skizz\", which was illustrated by Jim Baikie, told the story of the titular alien who crashes to Earth and is cared for by a teenager named Roxy, and Moore later noted that in his opinion, this work \"owes far too much to Alan Bleasdale.\" Another series he produced for \"2000AD\" was \"D.R. and Quinch\", which was illustrated by Alan Davis. The story, which Moore described as \"continuing the tradition of Dennis the Menace, but giving him a thermonuclear capacity\", revolved around two delinquent aliens, and was a science-fiction take on \"National Lampoon\"'s characters O.C. and Stiggs. The work widely considered to be the highlight of his \"2000AD\" career, and that he himself described as \"the one that worked best for me\" was \"The Ballad of Halo Jones\". Co-created with artist Ian Gibson, the series was set in the 50th century. The series was discontinued after three books due to a dispute between Moore and Fleetway, the magazine's publishers, over the intellectual property rights of the characters Moore and Gibson had co-created.\n\nAnother comic company to employ Moore was Marvel UK, who had formerly purchased a few of his one-off stories for \"Doctor Who Weekly\" and \"Star Wars Weekly\". Aiming to get an older audience than \"2000AD\", their main rival, they employed Moore to write for the regular strip \"Captain Britain\", \"halfway through a storyline that he's neither inaugurated nor completely understood.\" He replaced the former writer Dave Thorpe, but maintained the original artist, Alan Davis, whom Moore described as \"an artist whose love for the medium and whose sheer exultation upon finding himself gainfully employed within it shine from every line, every new costume design, each nuance of expression.\"\n\nThe third comic company that Moore worked for in this period was Quality Communications, publishers of a new monthly magazine called \"Warrior\". The magazine was founded by Dez Skinn, a former editor of both IPC (publishers of \"2000 AD\") and Marvel UK, and was designed to offer writers a greater degree of freedom over their artistic creations than was allowed by pre-existing companies. It was at \"Warrior\" that Moore \"would start to reach his potential\". Moore was initially given two ongoing strips in \"Warrior\": \"Marvelman\" and \"V for Vendetta\", both of which debuted in \"Warrior\"'s first issue in March 1982. \"V for Vendetta\" was a dystopian thriller set in a future 1997 where a fascist government controlled Britain, opposed only by a lone anarchist dressed in a Guy Fawkes costume who turns to terrorism to topple the government. Illustrated by David Lloyd, Moore was influenced by his pessimistic feelings about the Thatcherite Conservative government, which he projected forward as a fascist state in which all ethnic and sexual minorities had been eliminated. It has been regarded as \"among Moore's best work\" and has maintained a cult following throughout subsequent decades.\n\n\"Marvelman\" (later retitled \"Miracleman\" for legal reasons) was a series that originally had been published in Britain from 1954 through to 1963, based largely upon the American comic \"Captain Marvel\". Upon resurrecting \"Marvelman\", Moore \"took a kitsch children's character and placed him within the real world of 1982\". The work was drawn primarily by Garry Leach and Alan Davis. The third series that Moore produced for \"Warrior\" was \"The Bojeffries Saga\", a comedy about a working-class English family of vampires and werewolves, drawn by Steve Parkhouse. \"Warrior\" closed before these stories were completed, but under new publishers both \"Miracleman\" and \"V for Vendetta\" were resumed by Moore, who finished both stories by 1989. Moore's biographer Lance Parkin remarked that \"reading them through together throws up some interesting contrasts – in one the hero fights a fascist dictatorship based in London, in the other an Aryan superman imposes one.\"\n\nAlthough Moore's work numbered amongst the most popular strips to appear in \"2000 AD\", Moore himself became increasingly concerned at the lack of creator's rights in British comics. In 1985, he talked to fanzine \"Arkensword\", noting that he had stopped working for all British publishers bar IPC, \"purely for the reason that IPC so far have avoided lying to me, cheating me or generally treating me like shit.\" He did join other creators in decrying the wholesale relinquishing of all rights, and in 1986 stopped writing for \"2000 AD\", leaving mooted future volumes of the \"Halo Jones\" story unstarted. Moore's outspoken opinions and principles, particularly on the subject of creator's rights and ownership, would see him burn bridges with a number of other publishers over the course of his career.\n\nMeanwhile, during this same period, he – using the pseudonym of Translucia Baboon – became involved in the music scene, founding his own band, The Sinister Ducks, with David J (of goth band Bauhaus) and Alex Green, and in 1983 released a single, \"March of the Sinister Ducks\", with sleeve art by illustrator Kevin O'Neill. In 1984, Moore and David J released a 12-inch single featuring a recording of \"This Vicious Cabaret\", a song featured in \"V for Vendetta\", which was released on the Glass Records label. Moore would write the song \"Leopardman at C&A\" for David J, and it would be set to music by Mick Collins for the album \"We Have You Surrounded\" by Collins' group The Dirtbombs.\n\nMoore's work in \"2000 AD\" brought him to the attention of DC Comics editor Len Wein, who hired him in 1983 to write \"The Saga of the Swamp Thing\", then a formulaic and poor-selling monster comic. Moore, with artists Stephen R. Bissette, Rick Veitch, and John Totleben, deconstructed and reimagined the character, writing a series of formally experimental stories that addressed environmental and social issues alongside the horror and fantasy, bolstered by research into the culture of Louisiana, where the series was set. For \"Swamp Thing\" he revived many of DC's neglected magical and supernatural characters, including the Spectre, the Demon, the Phantom Stranger, Deadman, and others, and introduced John Constantine, an English working-class magician based visually on the British musician Sting; Constantine later became the protagonist of the series \"Hellblazer\", which became Vertigo's longest running series at 300 issues. Moore would continue writing \"Swamp Thing\" for almost four years, from issue No. 20 (January 1984) through to issue No. 64 (September 1987) with the exception of issues No. 59 and 62. Moore's run on \"Swamp Thing\" was successful both critically and commercially, and inspired DC to recruit British writers such as Grant Morrison, Jamie Delano, Peter Milligan, and Neil Gaiman to write comics in a similar vein, often involving radical revamps of obscure characters. These titles laid the foundation of what became the Vertigo line.\n\nMoore began producing further stories for DC Comics, including a two-part story for \"Vigilante\", which dealt with domestic abuse. He was eventually given the chance to write a story for one of DC's best-known superheroes, Superman, entitled \"For the Man Who Has Everything\", which was illustrated by Dave Gibbons and published in 1985. In this story, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Robin visit Superman on his birthday, only to find that he has been overcome by an alien organism and is hallucinating about his heart's desire. He followed this with another Superman story, \"\", which was published in 1986. Illustrated by Curt Swan, it was designed as the last Superman story in the pre-\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" DC Universe.\n\nThe limited series \"Watchmen\", begun in 1986 and collected as a trade paperback in 1987, cemented Moore's reputation. Imagining what the world would be like if costumed heroes had really existed since the 1940s, Moore and artist Dave Gibbons created a Cold War mystery in which the shadow of nuclear war threatens the world. The heroes who are caught up in this escalating crisis either work for the US government or are outlawed, and are motivated to heroism by their various psychological hang-ups. \"Watchmen\" is non-linear and told from multiple points of view, and includes highly sophisticated self-references, ironies, and formal experiments such as the symmetrical design of issue 5, \"Fearful Symmetry\", where the last page is a near mirror-image of the first, the second-last of the second, and so on, and in this manner is an early example of Moore's interest in the human perception of time and its implications for free will. It is the only comic to win the Hugo Award, in a one-time category (\"Best Other Form\"). It is widely seen as Moore's best work, and has been regularly described as the greatest comic book ever written. Alongside roughly contemporary works such as Frank Miller's \"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\", Art Spiegelman's \"Maus\", and Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez's \"Love and Rockets\", \"Watchmen\" was part of a late 1980s trend in American comics towards more adult sensibilities. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that \"Watchmen\" \"called into question the basic assumptions on which the super hero genre is formulated\". DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed in 2010 that \"As with \"The Dark Knight Returns\", \"Watchmen\" set off a chain reaction of rethinking the nature of super heroes and heroism itself, and pushed the genre darker for more than a decade. The series won acclaim ... and would continue to be regarded as one of the most important literary works the field ever produced.\" Moore briefly became a media celebrity, and the resulting attention led to him withdrawing from fandom and no longer attending comics conventions (at one UKCAC in London he is said to have been followed into the toilet by eager autograph hunters).\n\nHe and Gibbons had earlier created the character Mogo as part of DC's Green Lantern Corps and a short story by Moore and artist Kevin O'Neill published in \"Green Lantern Corps Annual\" No. 2 (1986) was one of the inspirations for the \"Blackest Night\" storyline in 2009-2010.\n\nIn 1987 Moore submitted a proposal for a miniseries called \"Twilight of the Superheroes\", the title a twist on Richard Wagner's opera \"Götterdämmerung\" (meaning \"Twilight of the Gods\"). The series was set in the future of the DC Universe, where the world is ruled by superheroic dynasties, including the House of Steel (presided over by Superman and Wonder Woman) and the House of Thunder (led by the Captain Marvel family). These two houses are about to unite through a dynastic marriage, their combined power potentially threatening freedom, and several characters, including John Constantine, attempt to stop it and free humanity from the power of superheroes. The series would also have restored the DC Universe's multiple earths, which had been eliminated in the continuity-revising 1985 limited series \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". The series was never commissioned, but copies of Moore's detailed notes have appeared on the Internet and in print despite the efforts of DC, who consider the proposal their property. Similar elements, such as the concept of hypertime, have since appeared in DC comics. The 1996 miniseries \"Kingdom Come\" by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, was also set amid a superheroic conflict in the future of the DC Universe. Waid and Ross have stated that they had read the \"Twilight\" proposal before starting work on their series, but that any similarities are both minor and unintended.\n\nMoore wrote the lead story in \"Batman Annual\" No. 11 (1987) drawn by George Freeman. The following year saw the publication of \"\", written by Moore and illustrated by Brian Bolland. It revolved around The Joker, who had escaped Arkham Asylum and gone on a killing spree, and Batman's effort to stop him. Despite being a key work in helping to redefine Batman as a character, along with Frank Miller's \"The Dark Knight Returns\" and \"\", Lance Parkin believed that \"the theme isn't developed enough\" and \"it's a rare example of a Moore story where the art is better than the writing,\" something Moore himself acknowledges.\n\nMoore's relationship with DC Comics had gradually deteriorated over the issues of creator's rights and merchandising. Moore and Gibbons were not paid any royalties for a \"Watchmen\" spin-off badge set, as DC defined them as a \"promotional item\", and according to certain reports, he and Gibbons gained only 2% of the profits earned by DC for \"Watchmen\". Meanwhile, a group of creators including Moore, Frank Miller, Marv Wolfman, and Howard Chaykin, fell out with DC over a proposed age-rating system similar to those used for films. After completing \"V for Vendetta\", which DC had already begun publishing, thus enabling him to finish the final few episodes, in 1989, Moore stopped working for DC.\n\nAbandoning DC Comics and the mainstream, Moore, with his wife Phyllis and their mutual lover Deborah Delano, set up their own comics publishing company, which they named Mad Love. The works that they published in Mad Love turned away from the science fiction and superhero genres that Moore was used to writing, instead focusing on realism, ordinary people, and political causes. Mad Love's first publication, \"AARGH\", was an anthology of work by a number of writers (including Moore) that challenged the Thatcher government's recently introduced Clause 28, a law designed to prevent councils and schools \"promoting homosexuality\". Sales from the book went towards the Organisation of Lesbian and Gay Action, and Moore was \"very pleased with\" it, stating that \"we hadn't prevented this bill from becoming law, but we had joined in the general uproar against it, which prevented it from ever becoming as viciously effective as its designers might have hoped.\" Moore followed this with a second political work, \"Shadowplay: The Secret Team\", a comic illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz for Eclipse Comics and commissioned by the Christic Institute, which was included as a part of the anthology \"Brought to Light\", a description of the CIA's covert drug smuggling and arms dealing. In 1998 \"Brought to Light\" was adapted by Moore in collaboration with composer Gary Lloyd as a narrative and music work which was released on cd.\n\nAfter prompting by cartoonist and self-publishing advocate Dave Sim, Moore then used Mad Love to publish his next project, \"Big Numbers\", a proposed 12-issue series set in \"a hardly-disguised version of Moore's native Northampton\" known as Hampton, and deals with the effects of big business on ordinary people and with ideas of chaos theory. Illustration of the comic was begun by Bill Sienkiewicz, who left the series after only two issues in 1990, and despite plans that his assistant, Al Columbia, would replace him, it never occurred and the series remained unfinished. Following this, in 1991 the company Victor Gollancz Ltd published Moore's \"A Small Killing\", a full length story illustrated by Oscar Zárate, about a once idealistic advertising executive haunted by his boyhood self. According to Lance Parkin, \"A Small Killing\" is \"quite possibly Moore's most underrated work\". Soon after this, Mad Love itself was disbanded as Phyllis and Deborah ended their relationship with Moore, taking with them much of the money that he had earned from his work in the 1980s.\n\nMeanwhile, Moore began producing work for \"Taboo\", a small independent comic anthology edited by his former collaborator Stephen R. Bissette. The first of these was \"From Hell\", a fictionalised account of the Jack the Ripper murders of the 1880s. Inspired by Douglas Adams' novel \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\", Moore reasoned that to solve a crime holistically, one would need to solve the entire society it occurred in, and depicts the murders as a consequence of the politics and economics of the time. Just about every notable figure of the period is connected with the events in some way, including \"Elephant Man\" Joseph Merrick, Oscar Wilde, Native American writer Black Elk, William Morris, artist Walter Sickert, and Aleister Crowley, who makes a brief appearance as a young boy. Illustrated in a sooty pen-and-ink style by Eddie Campbell, \"From Hell\" took nearly ten years to complete, outlasting \"Taboo\" and going through two more publishers before being collected as a trade paperback by Eddie Campbell Comics. It was widely praised, with comics author Warren Ellis calling it \"my all-time favourite graphic novel\".\n\nThe other series that Moore began for \"Taboo\" was \"Lost Girls\", which he described as a work of intelligent \"pornography\". Illustrated by Melinda Gebbie, with whom Moore subsequently entered into a relationship, it was set in 1913, where Alice from \"Alice in Wonderland\", Dorothy from \"The Wizard of Oz\" and Wendy from \"Peter Pan\" – who are each of a different age and class – all meet in a European hotel and regale each other with tales of their sexual encounters. With the work, Moore wanted to attempt something innovative in comics, and believed that creating comics pornography was a way of achieving this. He remarked that \"I had a lot of different ideas as to how it might be possible to do an up-front sexual comic strip and to do it in a way that would remove a lot of what I saw were the problems with pornography in general. That it's mostly ugly, it's mostly boring, it's not inventive – it has no standards.\" Like \"From Hell\", \"Lost Girls\" outlasted \"Taboo\", and a few subsequent instalments were published erratically until the work was finished and a complete edition published in 2006.\n\nMeanwhile, Moore set about writing a prose novel, eventually producing \"Voice of the Fire\", which would be published in 1996. Unconventional in tone, the novel was a set of short stories about linked events in his hometown of Northampton through the centuries, from the Bronze Age to the present day, which combined to tell a larger story.\n\nIn 1993 Moore declared himself to be a ceremonial magician. The same year marked a move by Moore back to the mainstream comics industry and back to writing superhero comics. He did so through Image Comics, widely known at the time for its flashy artistic style, graphic violence, and scantily clad large-breasted women, something that horrified many of his fans. His first work published by Image, an issue of the series \"Spawn\", was soon followed by the creation of his own mini-series, \"1963\", which was \"a pastiche of Jack Kirby stories drawn for Marvel in the sixties, with their rather overblown style, colourful characters and cosmic style\". According to Moore, \"after I'd done the \"1963\" stuff I'd become aware of how much the comic audience had changed while I'd been away [since 1988]. That all of a sudden it seemed that the bulk of the audience really wanted things that had almost no story, just lots of big, full-page pin-up sort of pieces of artwork. And I was genuinely interested to see if I could write a decent story for that market.\"\n\nHe subsequently set about writing what he saw as \"better than average stories for 13- to 15-year olds\", including three mini-series based upon the \"Spawn\" series: \"Violator\", \"Violator/Badrock\", and \"Spawn: Blood Feud\". In 1995, he was also given control of a regular monthly comic, Jim Lee's \"WildC.A.T.S.\", starting with issue No. 21, which he would continue to write for fourteen issues. The series followed two groups of superheroes, one of which is on a spaceship headed back to its home planet, and one of which remains on Earth. Moore's biographer Lance Parkin was critical of the run, feeling that it was one of Moore's worst, and that \"you feel Moore should be better than this. It's not special.\" Moore himself, who remarked that he took on the series – his only regular monthly comic series since \"Swamp Thing\" – largely because he liked Jim Lee, admitted that he was not entirely happy with the work, believing that he had catered too much to his conceptions of what the fans wanted rather than being innovative.\n\nNext he took over Rob Liefeld's \"Supreme\", about a character with many similarities with DC Comics' Superman. Instead of emphasising increased realism as he had done with earlier superhero comics he had taken over, Moore did the opposite, and began basing the series on the Silver Age Superman comics of the 1960s, introducing a female superhero Suprema, a super-dog Radar, and a Kryptonite-like material known as Supremium, in doing so harking back to the original \"mythic\" figure of the American superhero. Under Moore, Supreme would prove to be a critical and commercial success, announcing that he was back in the mainstream after several years of self-imposed exile.\n\nWhen Rob Liefeld, one of Image's co-founders, split from the publisher and formed his own company Awesome Entertainment, he hired Moore to create a new universe for the characters he had brought with him from Image. Moore's \"solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them.\" Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as \"Glory\" and \"Youngblood\", as well as a three-part mini-series known as \"Judgment Day\" to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe. Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying \"I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the work and I found it hard to respect him. And also by then I was probably feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee, Jim Valentino – people like that – that a couple of the Image partners were seeming, to my eyes, to be less than gentlemen. They were seeming to be not necessarily the people I wanted to deal with.\"\n\nImage partner Jim Lee offered to provide Moore with his own imprint, which would be under Lee's company WildStorm Productions. Moore named this imprint America's Best Comics, lining up a series of artists and writers to assist him in this venture. Lee soon sold WildStorm – including America's Best Comics – to DC Comics, and \"Moore found himself back with a company he'd vowed to never work with again\". Lee and editor Scott Dunbier flew to England personally to reassure Moore that he would not be affected by the sale, and would not have to deal with DC directly. Moore decided that there were too many people involved to back out from the project, and so ABC was launched in early 1999.\n\nThe first series published by ABC was \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", which featured a variety of characters from Victorian adventure novels, such as H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain, H. G. Wells' Invisible Man, Jules Verne's Captain Nemo, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Wilhelmina Murray from Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\". Illustrated by Kevin O'Neill, the first volume of the series pitted the League against Professor Moriarty from the \"Sherlock Holmes\" books; the second, against the Martians from \"The War of the Worlds\". A third volume entitled \"The Black Dossier\" was set in the 1950s. The series was well received, and Moore was pleased that an American audience was enjoying something he considered \"perversely English\", and that it was inspiring some readers to get interested in Victorian literature.\n\nAnother of Moore's ABC works was \"Tom Strong\", a post-modern superhero series, featured a hero inspired by characters pre-dating Superman, such as Doc Savage and Tarzan. The character's drug-induced longevity allowed Moore to include flashbacks to Strong's adventures throughout the 20th century, written and drawn in period styles, as a comment on the history of comics and pulp fiction. The primary artist was Chris Sprouse. \"Tom Strong\" bore many similarities to Moore's earlier work on \"Supreme\", but according to Lance Parkin, was \"more subtle\", and was \"ABC's most accessible comic\".\n\nMoore's \"Top 10\", a deadpan police procedural drama set in a city called Neopolis where everyone, including the police, criminals, and civilians has super-powers, costumes, and secret identities, was drawn by Gene Ha and Zander Cannon. The series ended after twelve issues, but has spawned four spin-offs: a miniseries \"Smax\", which was set in a fantasy realm and drawn by Cannon; \"\", a prequel to the main \"Top Ten\" series drawn by Ha; and two sequel miniseries, \"\", which was written by Paul Di Filippo and drawn by Jerry Ordway, and \"Top 10: Season Two\", written by Cannon and drawn by Ha.\n\nMoore's series \"Promethea\", which told the story of a teenage girl, Sophie Bangs, who is possessed by an ancient pagan goddess, the titular Promethea, explored many occult themes, particularly the Qabalah and the concept of magic, with Moore stating that \"I wanted to be able to do an occult comic that didn't portray the occult as a dark, scary place, because that's not my experience of it ... [\"Promethea\" was] more psychedelic ... more sophisticated, more experimental, more ecstatic and exuberant.\" Drawn by J. H. Williams III, it has been described as \"a personal statement\" from Moore, being one of his most personal works, and that it encompasses \"a belief system, a personal cosmology\".\n\nABC Comics was also used to publish an anthology series, \"Tomorrow Stories\", which featured a regular cast of characters such as Cobweb, First American, Greyshirt, Jack B. Quick, and Splash Brannigan. \"Tomorrow Stories\" was notable for being an anthology series, a medium that had largely died out in American comics at the time.\n\nDespite the assurances that DC Comics would not interfere with Moore and his work, they subsequently did so, angering him. Specifically, in \"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" No. 5, an authentic vintage advertisement for a \"Marvel\"-brand douche caused DC executive Paul Levitz to order the entire print run destroyed and reprinted with the advertisement amended to \"Amaze\", to avoid friction with DC's competitor Marvel Comics. A \"Cobweb\" story Moore wrote for \"Tomorrow Stories\" No. 8 featuring references to L. Ron Hubbard, American occultist Jack Parsons, and the \"Babalon Working\", was blocked by DC Comics due to the subject matter. DC had already published a version of the same event in their Paradox Press volume \"The Big Book of Conspiracies\".\n\nIn 2003, a documentary about him was made by Shadowsnake Films, titled \"The Mindscape of Alan Moore\", which was later released on DVD.\n\nWith many of the stories he had planned for America's Best Comics brought to an end, and with his increasing dissatisfaction with how DC Comics were interfering with his work, he decided to once more pull out of the comics mainstream. In 2005, he remarked that \"I love the comics medium. I pretty much detest the comics industry. Give it another 15 months, I'll probably be pulling out of mainstream, commercial comics.\" The only ABC title continued by Moore was \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\"; after cutting ties with DC he launched the new \"League\" saga, \"\", in a co-publishing partnership of Top Shelf Productions and Knockabout Comics, the first part released in 2009, the second in 2011 and the third released in 2012.\n\nIn 2006, the complete edition of \"Lost Girls\" was published, as a slipcased set of three hardcover volumes. The same year Moore published an eight-page article tracing out the history of pornography in which he argued that a society's vibrancy and success are related to its permissiveness in sexual matters. Decrying that the consumption of contemporary ubiquitous pornography was still widely considered shameful, he called for a new and more artistic pornography that could be openly discussed and would have a beneficial impact on society. He expanded on this for a 2009 book-length essay entitled \"25,000 years of Erotic Freedom\", which was described by a reviewer as \"a tremendously witty history lecture – a sort of \"Horrible Histories\" for grownups.\"\n\nIn 2007 Moore appeared in animated form in an episode of \"The Simpsons\" – a show of which he is a fan – entitled \"Husbands and Knives\", which aired on his fifty-fourth birthday.\n\nSince 2009 Moore has been a panellist on the BBC Radio 4 programme \"The Infinite Monkey Cage\", which is hosted by physicist Brian Cox and comedian Robin Ince.\n\nIn 2010 Moore began what he described as \"the 21st century's first underground magazine\". Titled \"Dodgem Logic\", the bi-monthly publication consists of work by a number of Northampton-based authors and artists, as well as original contributions from Moore.\n\nIn January 2011, the fourth and final issue of Moore's \"Neonomicon\" was released by Avatar Press. This horror mini-series is set in the H. P. Lovecraft universe, and like \"The Courtyard\", is illustrated by Jacen Burrows.\n\nMoore has appeared live at music events collaborating with a number of different musicians, including a 2011 appearance with Stephen O'Malley at the All Tomorrow's Parties 'I'll Be Your Mirror' music festival in London.\n\nA planned future project is an occult textbook known as \"The Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic\", written with Steve Moore. It will be published by Top Shelf in \"the future\". In September 2016, he published a novel called \"Jerusalem\", which is also set in Northampton.\n\nAlan Moore has joined the Occupy Comics Kickstarter project. Moore contributed an essay on comics as counter-culture.\n\nHe continues to work with Kevin O'Neill on their \"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" spin-off, \"Nemo\". Avatar Press announced a twelve-part series with Jacen Burrows called \"Providence\" on H. P. Lovecraft and the sources of the Cthulhu Mythos for 2015, which has since been completed.\n\nIn 2014 Moore announced that he was leading a research and development project to \"create an app enabling digital comics to be made by anyone\". \"Electricomics\" premiered in 2015. It is an open source app for reading and creating interactive comics. Moore wrote the story \"Big Nemo\", a dystopian sequel to Winsor McCay's Little Nemo. It was illustrated by Colleen Doran and animated by Ocasta Studios with colors by Jose Villarubia. \"The Guardian\" chose it as one of the best iPhone/iPad apps of 2015. Pipedream Comics named it the Digital Comics App of the Year.\n\nIn 2016, Moore confirmed that after authoring a final \"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" book, he plans on retiring from regularly writing comic books.\n\nAs of April 2016, Moore has been curating a comic book anthology series entitled \"Cinema Purgatorio\" published by Avatar Press, each issue opening with a story written by Moore and illustrated by Kevin O'Neill. The book also features the writing and artist team-ups of Garth Ennis & Raulo Cáceres (\"Code Pru\"), Max Brooks & Michael DiPascale (\"A More Perfect Union\"), Kieron Gillen & Ignacio Calero (\"Modded\"), and Christos Gage & Gabriel Andrade (\"The Vast\"). The anthology series has been described as “Classic tropes of pulp fiction, either turned on their head, given new filters or explored in ridiculous detail, by some of the very best comic creators we have today.”\n\nIn 2018 Moore contributed to the comic anthology \"24 Panels\". The publication was curated by Kieron Gillan and intended to raise funds for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire of 2017.\n\nIn a number of his comics, where he was taking over from earlier writers, including \"Marvelman\", \"Swamp Thing\", and \"Supreme\", he used the \"familiar tactic of wiping out what had gone before, giving the hero amnesia and revealing that everything we'd learned to that point was a lie.\" In this manner he was largely able to start afresh with the character and their series and was not constrained by earlier canon. While commenting on the artistic restrictiveness of serialised comic books, artist Joe Rubinstein gave the example that a comics creator would be limited in what he could do with Spider-Man, and added, \"unless you're Alan Moore, who would probably kill him and bring him back as a real spider or something\".\n\nAs a comics writer, Moore applies literary sensibilities to the mainstream of the medium as well as including challenging subject matter and adult themes. He brings a wide range of influences to his work, such as William S. Burroughs, Thomas Pynchon, Robert Anton Wilson, and Iain Sinclair, New Wave science fiction writers like Michael Moorcock, and horror writers such as Clive Barker. Influences within comics include Will Eisner, Steve Ditko, Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Kirby, and Bryan Talbot.\n\nMoore's work in the comic book medium has been widely recognised by his peers and by critics. Comics historian George Khoury asserted that \"to call this free spirit the best writer in the history of comic books is an understatement\" whilst interviewer Steve Rose referred to him as \"the Orson Welles of comics\" who is \"the undisputed high priest of the medium, whose every word is seized upon like a message from the ether\" by comic book fans. Douglas Wolk observed: \"Moore has undisputably made it into the Hall of Fame: he's one of the pillars of English language comics, alongside Jack Kirby and Will Eisner and Harvey Kurtzman and not many others. He's also the grand exception in that hall, since the other pillars are artists – and more often than not, writer/artists. Moore is a writer almost exclusively, though his hyper detailed scripts always play to the strengths of the artists he works with. That makes him the chief monkey wrench in comics author theory. The main reason that almost nobody's willing to say that a single cartoonist is \"categorically\" superior to a writer/artist team is that such a rule would run smack into Moore's bibliography. In fact, a handful of cartoonists who almost always write the stories they draw have made exceptions for Moore – Jaime Hernandez, Mark Beyer and most memorably Eddie Campbell.\"\nMoore has won numerous Jack Kirby Awards during his career, including for Best Single Issue for \"Swamp Thing Annual\" No. 2 in 1985 with John Totleben and Steve Bissette, for Best Continuing Series for \"Swamp Thing\" in 1985, 1986 and 1987 with Totleben and Bissette, Best Writer for \"Swamp Thing\" in 1985 and 1986 and for \"Watchmen\" in 1987, and with Dave Gibbons for Best Finite Series and Best Writer/Artist (Single or Team) for \"Watchmen\" in 1987.\n\nHe received an Inkpot Award at the San Diego Comic-Con International in 1985.\n\nMoore has won multiple Eagle Awards, including virtually a \"clean sweep\" in 1986 for his work on \"Watchmen\" and \"Swamp Thing\". Moore not only won \"favourite writer in both the US and UK categories\", but had his work win for favourite comic book, supporting character, and new title in the US; and character, continuing story and \"character worthy of own title\" in the UK (in which last category his works held all top three spots).\n\nMoore has been nominated for the \"Comics Buyer's Guide\" Fan Awards several times, winning for Favorite Writer in 1985, 1986, 1987, 1999, and 2000. He won the CBG Fan Award for Favorite Comic Book Story (\"Watchmen\") in 1987 and Favorite Original Graphic Novel or Album (\"\" with Brian Bolland) in 1988.\n\nHe received the Harvey Award for Best Writer for 1988 (for \"Watchmen\"), for 1995 and 1996 (for \"From Hell\"), for 1999 (for his body of work, including \"From Hell\" and \"Supreme\"), for 2000 (for \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\"), and for 2001 and 2003 (for \"Promethea\").\n\nAmong his numerous international prizes are the German Max & Moritz Prize for an exceptional oeuvre (2008) and the British National Comics Award for Best Comics Writer Ever (in 2001 and 2002). He also won French awards like the Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Best Album for \"Watchmen\" in 1989 and \"V for Vendetta\" in 1990, and the Prix de la critique for \"From Hell\" in 2001, the Swedish Urhunden Prize in 1992 for \"Watchmen\" and several Spanish Haxtur Awards, in 1988 for \"Watchmen\" and 1989 for \"Swamp Thing\" No. 5 (both for Best Writer).\n\nIn 1988 he received a World Fantasy Award for Best Novella for \"A Hypothetical Lizard\", which Avatar Press published in 2004 as a comics adaption by Antony Johnston. Moore also won two International Horror Guild Awards in the category Graphic Story/Illustrated Narrative (in 1995 with Eddie Campbell for \"From Hell\" and in 2003 with Kevin O'Neill for \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\") Moore received a Bram Stoker Award in the category Best Illustrated Narrative for \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" in 2000, then again in 2012 for \"Neonomicon\" as Best Graphic Novel.\n\nIn 2005, \"Watchmen\" was the only graphic novel to make it on to \"Time\"'s \"The 100 Best Novels from 1923 to the Present\" list.\n\nBest Writer\n\nBest Writer/Artist\n\nBest Single Issue/Single Story\n\nBest Serialized Story\n\nBest Continuing Series\n\nBest Finite Series/Limited Series\n\nBest New Series\n\nBest Anthology\n\nBest Graphic Album/Best Graphic Album: New\nBest Graphic Album: Reprint\n\nThe Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame\n\nDue to the success of his comics, a number of filmmakers have expressed a desire to make film adaptations over the years. Moore himself has consistently opposed such ventures, stating that \"I wanted to give comics a special place when I was writing things like \"Watchmen\". I wanted to show off just what the possibilities of the comic book medium were, and films are completely different.\" Expressing similar sentiments, he also remarked that \"If we only see comics in relation to movies then the best that they will ever be is films that do not move. I found it, in the mid 80s, preferable to concentrate on those things that only comics could achieve. The way in which a tremendous amount of information could be included visually in every panel, the juxtapositions between what a character was saying and what the image that the reader was looking at would be. So in a sense ... most of my work from the 80s onwards was designed to be un-filmable.\"\n\nThe first film to be based upon Moore's work was \"From Hell\" in 2001, which was directed by the Hughes Brothers. The film made a number of radical differences from the original comic, altering the main character from an older, conservative detective to a young character played by Johnny Depp. This was followed in 2003 with \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", a film that departed radically from the books, changing the ending from a mob war over the skies of London to the infiltration of a secret base in Tibet. For these two works, Moore was content to allow the filmmakers to do whatever they wished and removed himself from the process entirely. \"As long as I could distance myself by not seeing them,\" he said, he could profit from the films while leaving the original comics untouched, \"assured no one would confuse the two. This was probably naïve on my part.\"\n\nHis attitude changed after producer Martin Poll and screenwriter Larry Cohen filed a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox, alleging that the film \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" plagiarised an unproduced script they had written entitled \"Cast of Characters\". According to Moore, \"They seemed to believe that the head of 20th Century Fox called me up and persuaded me to steal this screenplay, turning it into a comic book they could then adapt back into a movie, to camouflage petty larceny.\" Moore testified in a deposition, a process he found so unpleasant that he surmised he would have been better treated had he \"molested and murdered a busload of retarded children after giving them heroin\". Fox's settlement of the case insulted Moore, who interpreted it as an admission of guilt. In 2012 Moore claimed that he had sold the rights to these two works simply for the money; he did not expect the films ever to be made. He was simply \"getting money for old rope\". Moore said in an interview in 2012 that he had seen neither film.\n\nIn 2005 a film adaptation of Moore's \"V for Vendetta\" was released, produced by The Wachowskis and directed by James McTeigue. Producer Joel Silver said at a press conference for the Warner Bros.' \"V for Vendetta\" that fellow producer Lana Wachowski had talked with Moore, and that \"[Moore] was very excited about what [Lana] had to say.\" Moore disputed this, reporting that he told Wachowski \"I didn't want anything to do with films ... I wasn't interested in Hollywood,\" and demanded that DC Comics force Warner Bros to issue a public retraction and apology for Silver's \"blatant lies\". Although Silver called Moore directly to apologise, no public retraction appeared. Moore was quoted as saying that the comic book had been \"specifically about things like fascism and anarchy. Those words, 'fascism' and 'anarchy,' occur nowhere in the film. It's been turned into a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country.\"\n\nMoore also publicly criticised details of the script before the film's release, pointing to apparent laziness in the writing. \"They don't know what British people have for breakfast, they couldn't be bothered [to find out]. 'Eggy in a basket' apparently. Now the US have 'eggs in a basket,' which is fried bread with a fried egg in a hole in the middle. I guess they thought we must eat that as well, and thought 'eggy in a basket' was a quaint and Olde Worlde version\", he stated.\n\nThis conflict between Moore and DC Comics was the subject of an article in \"The New York Times\" on 12 March 2006, five days before the US release. In the \"New York Times\" article, Silver stated that about 20 years prior to the film's release he had met with Moore and Dave Gibbons when Silver acquired the film rights to \"V For Vendetta\" and \"Watchmen\". Silver stated, \"Alan was odd, but he was enthusiastic and encouraging us to do this. I had foolishly thought that he would continue feeling that way today, not realising that he wouldn't.\" Moore did not deny this meeting or Silver's characterisation of Moore at that meeting, nor did Moore state that he advised Silver of his change of opinion in those approximately 20 years. The \"New York Times\" article also interviewed David Lloyd about Moore's reaction to the film's production, stating, \"Mr Lloyd, the illustrator of \"V for Vendetta\", also found it difficult to sympathise with Mr Moore's protests. When he and Mr Moore sold their film rights to the comic book, Mr Lloyd said: \"We didn't do it innocently. Neither myself nor Alan thought we were signing it over to a board of trustees who would look after it like it was the Dead Sea Scrolls.\"\n\nMoore has subsequently stated that he wishes his name to be removed from all comic work that he does not own, including \"Watchmen\" and \"V for Vendetta\", much as unhappy film directors often choose to have their names removed and be credited as \"Alan Smithee\". He also announced that he would not allow his name to be used in any future film adaptations of works he does not own, nor would he accept any money from such adaptations. This request was respected by the producers of the subsequent adaptations of his work \"Constantine\" (2005) (based on a character created by Moore) and \"Watchmen\" (2009).\n\nIn a 2012 interview with LeftLion magazine, Alan Moore was asked to put a figure on how much money he had turned down by refusing to be associated with these film adaptations. He estimated it to be 'at least a few million dollars' and said: \"You can't buy that kind of empowerment. To just know that as far as you are aware, you have not got a price; that there is not an amount of money large enough to make you compromise even a tiny bit of principle that, as it turned out, would make no practical difference anyway. I'd advise everyone to do it, otherwise you're going to end up mastered by money and that's not a thing you want ruling your life.\"\n\nSince his teenage years Moore has had long hair, and since early adulthood has also had a beard. He has taken to wearing a number of large rings on his hands, leading him to be described as a \"cross between Hagrid and Danny from \"Withnail And I\"\" who could be easily mistaken for \"the village eccentric\". Born and raised in Northampton, he continues to live in the town, and used its history as a basis for his novels \"Voice of the Fire\" and \"Jerusalem\". His \"unassuming terraced\" Northampton home was described by an interviewer in 2001 as \"something like an occult bookshop under permanent renovation, with records, videos, magical artefacts and comic-book figurines strewn among shelves of mystical tomes and piles of paper. The bathroom, with blue-and-gold décor and a generous sunken tub, is palatial; the rest of the house has possibly never seen a vacuum cleaner. This is clearly a man who spends little time on the material plane.\" He likes to live in his home town, feeling that it affords him a level of obscurity that he enjoys, remarking that \"I never signed up to be a celebrity.\" He has spoken in praise of the town's former Radical MP, Charles Bradlaugh at the annual commemoration. He is also a vegetarian.\n\nWith his first wife Phyllis, whom he married in the early 1970s, he has two daughters, Leah and Amber. The couple also had a mutual lover, Deborah, although the relationship between the three ended in the early 1990s as Phyllis and Deborah left Moore, taking his daughters with them. On 12 May 2007, he married Melinda Gebbie, with whom he has worked on several comics, most notably \"Lost Girls\".\n\nIn 1993, on his fortieth birthday, Moore openly declared his dedication to being a ceremonial magician, something he saw as \"a logical end step to my career as a writer\". According to a 2001 interview, his inspiration for doing this came when he was writing \"From Hell\" in the early 1990s, a book containing much Freemasonic and occult symbolism: \"One word balloon in \"From Hell\" completely hijacked my life ... A character says something like, 'The one place gods inarguably exist is in the human mind'. After I wrote that, I realised I'd accidentally made a true statement, and now I'd have to rearrange my entire life around it. The only thing that seemed to really be appropriate was to become a magician.\" Moore associates magic very much with writing; \"I believe that magic is art, and that art, whether that be music, writing, sculpture, or any other form, is literally magic. Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words or images, to achieve changes in consciousness ... Indeed to cast a spell is simply to spell, to manipulate words, to change people's consciousness, and this is why I believe that an artist or writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world to a shaman.\"\n\nConnecting his esoteric beliefs with his career in writing, he conceptualised a hypothetical area known as the \"Idea Space\", describing it as \"... a space in which mental events can be said to occur, an idea space which is perhaps universal. Our individual consciousnesses have access to this vast universal space, just as we have individual houses, but the street outside the front door belongs to everybody. It's almost as if ideas are pre-existing forms within this space ... The landmasses that might exist in this mind space would be composed entirely of ideas, of concepts, that instead of continents and islands you might have large belief systems, philosophies, Marxism might be one, Judeo-Christian religions might make up another.\" He subsequently believed that to navigate this space, magical systems like the tarot and the Qabalah would have to be used.\n\nTaking up the study of the Qabalah and the writings of the notorious early 20th-century occultist Aleister Crowley, Moore accepted ideas from Crowley's religion, Thelema, about True Will being connected to the will of the pantheistic universe. In some of his earlier magical rituals, he used mind-altering psychedelic drugs but later gave this up, believing that they were unnecessary, and stated, \"It's frightening. You call out the names in this strange incomprehensible language, and you're looking into the glass and there appears to be this little man talking to you. It just works.\"\n\nMoore took as his primary deity the ancient Roman snake god Glycon, who was the centre of a cult founded by a prophet known as Alexander of Abonoteichus, and according to Alexander's critic Lucian, the god itself was merely a puppet, something Moore accepts, considering him to be a \"complete hoax\", but dismisses as irrelevant. According to Pagan Studies scholar Ethan Doyle-White, \"The very fact that Glycon was probably one big hoax was enough to convince Moore to devote himself to the scaly lord, for, as Moore maintains, the imagination is just as real as reality.\"\n\nMoore is a member of Northampton Arts Lab and takes walks with the novelist Alistair Fruish.\n\nMoore politically identifies as an anarchist, and outlined his interpretation of anarchist philosophy, and its application to fiction writing in an interview with Margaret Killjoy, collected in the 2009 book, \"Mythmakers and Lawbreakers\":\n\nIn December 2011, Moore responded to Frank Miller's attack on the Occupy movement, calling his more recent work misogynistic, homophobic and misguided. Worldwide, Occupy protesters have adopted the Guy Fawkes mask from \"V for Vendetta\". The mask has also been adopted by Anonymous, WikiLeaks, Egyptian revolutionaries, and anti-globalization demonstrators. Moore described Occupy as \"ordinary people reclaiming rights which should always have been theirs\" and added:\n\nMoore is a member of The Arts Emergency Service, a British charity working with 16- to 19-year-olds in further education from diverse backgrounds.\n\nIn the 2017 general election, Moore expressed guarded support for the Labour Party, mainly due to the left-wing socialist Jeremy Corbyn being elected leader, though he does not vote as a matter of political principle.\n\nDoing research into conspiracy theories for his work on \"Brought to Light\", Moore came to develop his own opinions on the subject of a global conspiracy, stating that \"Yes, there is a conspiracy, indeed there are a great number of conspiracies, all tripping each other up ... the main thing that I learned about conspiracy theories is that conspiracy theorists actually believe in the conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is chaotic. The truth is, that it is not the Jewish banking conspiracy, or the grey aliens, or the twelve-foot reptiloids from another dimension that are in control, the truth is far more frightening; no-one is in control, the world is rudderless.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50650", "title": "Astronomy", "text": "Astronomy\n\nAstronomy (from ) is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; the phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject is physical cosmology, which is the study of the Universe as a whole.\n\nAstronomy is one of the oldest of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas, performed methodical observations of the night sky. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.\n\nProfessional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.\n\nAstronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs still play an active role, especially in the discovery and observation of transient events. Amateur astronomers have made and contributed to many important astronomical discoveries, such as finding new comets.\n\n\"Astronomy\" (from the Greek ἀστρονομία from ἄστρον \"astron\", \"star\" and -νομία \"-nomia\" from νόμος \"nomos\", \"law\" or \"culture\") means \"law of the stars\" (or \"culture of the stars\" depending on the translation). Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects. Although the two fields share a common origin, they are now entirely distinct.\n\nGenerally, both of the terms \"astronomy\" and \"astrophysics\" may be used to refer to the same subject. Based on strict dictionary definitions, \"astronomy\" refers to \"the study of objects and matter outside the Earth's atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties,\" while \"astrophysics\" refers to the branch of astronomy dealing with \"the behavior, physical properties, and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena.\" In some cases, as in the introduction of the introductory textbook \"The Physical Universe\" by Frank Shu, \"astronomy\" may be used to describe the qualitative study of the subject, whereas \"astrophysics\" is used to describe the physics-oriented version of the subject. However, since most modern astronomical research deals with subjects related to physics, modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics. Some fields, such as astrometry, are purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics. Various departments in which scientists carry out research on this subject may use \"astronomy\" and \"astrophysics,\" partly depending on whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department, and many professional astronomers have physics rather than astronomy degrees. Some titles of the leading scientific journals in this field include \"The Astronomical Journal\", \"The Astrophysical Journal,\" and \"Astronomy and Astrophysics\".\n\nIn early historic times, astronomy only consisted of the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.\n\nBefore tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop. Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.\n\nA particularly important early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy, which began among the Babylonians, who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that developed in many other civilizations. The Babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses recurred in a repeating cycle known as a saros.\nFollowing the Babylonians, significant advances in astronomy were made in ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the Moon and Sun, and he proposed a model of the solar system where the Earth and planets rotated around the sun, now called the heliocentric model. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe. Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy. The Antikythera mechanism (c. 150–80 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.\n\nMedieval Europe housed a number of astronomers who made progress. Richard of Wallingford (1292–1336) made major contributions to astronomy and horology, including the invention of the first astronomical clock, the Rectangulus which allowed for the measurement of angles between planets and other astornomical bodies, as well as an equatorium called the \"Albion\" which could be used for astronomical calculations such as lunar, solar and planetary longitudes and could predict eclipses. Nicole Oresme (1320-1382) and Jean Buridan (1300-1361) first discussed evidence for the rotation of the Earth, furthermore, Buridan also developed the theory of impetus (predecessor of the modern scientific theory of inertia) which was able to show planets were capable of motion without the intervention of angels. Georg von Peuerbach (1423-1461) and Regiomontanus (1436-1476) helped make astronomical progress instrumental to Copernicus's development of the heliocentric model decades later. \n\nAstronomy flourished in the Islamic world and other parts of the world. This led to the emergence of the first astronomical observatories in the Muslim world by the early 9th century. In 964, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest galaxy in the Local Group, was described by the Persian astronomer Azophi in his \"Book of Fixed Stars\". The SN 1006 supernova, the brightest apparent magnitude stellar event in recorded history, was observed by the Egyptian Arabic astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and Chinese astronomers in 1006. Some of the prominent Islamic (mostly Persian and Arab) astronomers who made significant contributions to the science include Al-Battani, Thebit, Azophi, Albumasar, Biruni, Arzachel, Al-Birjandi, and the astronomers of the Maragheh and Samarkand observatories. Astronomers during that time introduced many Arabic names now used for individual stars. It is also believed that the ruins at Great Zimbabwe and Timbuktu may have housed astronomical observatories. Europeans had previously believed that there had been no astronomical observation in sub-Saharan Africa during the pre-colonial Middle Ages, but modern discoveries show otherwise.\n\nFor over six centuries (from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment), the Roman Catholic Church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy than probably all other institutions. Among the Church's motives was finding the date for Easter.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system. His work was defended by Galileo Galilei and expanded upon by Johannes Kepler. Kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the planets around the sun. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was Isaac Newton, with his invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation, who finally explained the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.\n\nImprovements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries. The English astronomer John Flamsteed catalogued over 3000 stars, More extensive star catalogues were produced by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. The astronomer William Herschel made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet Uranus, the first new planet found. The distance to a star was announced in 1838 when the parallax of 61 Cygni was measured by Friedrich Bessel.\n\nDuring the 18–19th centuries, the study of the three-body problem by Leonhard Euler, Alexis Claude Clairaut, and Jean le Rond d'Alembert led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Joseph Louis Lagrange and Pierre Simon Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.\n\nSignificant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and photography. Joseph von Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, Gustav Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of temperatures, masses, and sizes.\n\nThe existence of the Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way, as its own group of stars was only proved in the 20th century, along with the existence of \"external\" galaxies. The observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the Universe. Theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as black holes and neutron stars, which have been used to explain such observed phenomena as quasars, pulsars, blazars, and radio galaxies. Physical cosmology made huge advances during the 20th century. In the early 1900s the model of the Big Bang theory was formulated, heavily evidenced by cosmic microwave background radiation, Hubble's law, and the cosmological abundances of elements. Space telescopes have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere. In February 2016, it was revealed that the LIGO project had detected evidence of gravitational waves in the previous September.\n\nOur main source of information about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light, or more generally electromagnetic radiation. Observational astronomy may be categorized according to the corresponding region of the electromagnetic spectrum on which the observations are made. Some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the Earth's surface, while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere. Specific information on these subfields is given below.\n\nRadio astronomy uses radiation with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter, outside the visible range. Radio astronomy is different from most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.\n\nAlthough some radio waves are emitted directly by astronomical objects, a product of thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed is the result of synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields. Additionally, a number of spectral lines produced by interstellar gas, notably the hydrogen spectral line at 21 cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.\n\nA wide variety of other objects are observable at radio wavelengths, including supernovae, interstellar gas, pulsars, and active galactic nuclei.\n\nInfrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.\nWith the exception of infrared wavelengths close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space. Some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared. This allows the study of the chemistry of space; more specifically it can detect water in comets.\n\nHistorically, optical astronomy, also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of astronomy. Images of observations were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700 nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.\n\nUltraviolet astronomy employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200 Å (10 to 320 nm). Light at those wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei. However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.\n\nX-ray astronomy uses X-ray wavelengths. Typically, X-ray radiation is produced by synchrotron emission (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), thermal emission from thin gases above 10 (10 million) kelvins, and thermal emission from thick gases above 10 Kelvin. Since X-rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, all X-ray observations must be performed from high-altitude balloons, rockets, or X-ray astronomy satellites. Notable X-ray sources include X-ray binaries, pulsars, supernova remnants, elliptical galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and active galactic nuclei.\n\nGamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nMost gamma-ray emitting sources are actually gamma-ray bursts, objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, neutron stars, and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei.\n\nIn addition to electromagnetic radiation, a few other events originating from great distances may be observed from the Earth.\n\nIn neutrino astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded underground facilities such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III for the detection of neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A. Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories. Some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nGravitational-wave astronomy is an emerging field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, such as the \"Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory\" LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole. A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.\n\nThe combination of observations made using electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos or gravitational waves and other complementary information, is known as multi-messenger astronomy.\n\nOne of the oldest fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of calendars.\n\nCareful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics. More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.\n\nThe measurement of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder that is used to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated dark matter in the galaxy.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the measurement of the stellar wobble of nearby stars was used to detect large extrasolar planets orbiting those stars.\n\nTheoretical astronomers use several tools including analytical models and computational numerical simulations; each has its particular advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving broader insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models reveal the existence of phenomena and effects otherwise unobserved.\n\nTheorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models and from the results predict observational consequences of those models. The observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomena.\n\nTheorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.\n\nPhenomena modeled by theoretical astronomers include: stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation; large-scale distribution of matter in the Universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics. Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole (\"astro\")physics and the study of gravitational waves.\n\nSome widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now included in the Lambda-CDM model are the Big Bang, Cosmic inflation, dark matter, and fundamental theories of physics.\n\nA few examples of this process:\n\nDark matter and dark energy are the current leading topics in astronomy, as their discovery and controversy originated during the study of the galaxies.\n\nAstrophysics is the branch of astronomy that employs the principles of physics and chemistry \"to ascertain the nature of the astronomical objects, rather than their positions or motions in space\". Among the objects studied are the Sun, other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background. Their emissions are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, \"astrophysicists\" typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.\n\nIn practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of dark matter, dark energy, and black holes; whether or not time travel is possible, wormholes can form, or the multiverse exists; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe. Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include Solar System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.\n\nAt a distance of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a variable star, but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle. This is an 11-year oscillation in sunspot number. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.\n\nThe Sun has steadily increased in luminosity by 40% since it first became a main-sequence star. The Sun has also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant impact on the Earth. The Maunder minimum, for example, is believed to have caused the Little Ice Age phenomenon during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe visible outer surface of the Sun is called the photosphere. Above this layer is a thin region known as the chromosphere. This is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated corona.\n\nAt the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.\n\nA solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the Sun until, at the outermost limit of the Solar System, it reaches the heliopause. As the solar wind passes the Earth, it interacts with the Earth's magnetic field (magnetosphere) and deflects the solar wind, but traps some creating the Van Allen radiation belts that envelop the Earth. The aurora are created when solar wind particles are guided by the magnetic flux lines into the Earth's polar regions where the lines the descend into the atmosphere.\n\nAstrobiology is an interdisciplinary scientific field concerned with the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. Astrobiology considers the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists, and how humans can detect it if it does. The term exobiology is similar.\n\nAstrobiology makes use of molecular biology, biophysics, biochemistry, chemistry, astronomy, physical cosmology, exoplanetology and geology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from that on Earth. The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology. Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data, and although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories.\n\nThis interdisciplinary field encompasses research on the origin of planetary systems, origins of organic compounds in space, rock-water-carbon interactions, abiogenesis on Earth, planetary habitability, research on biosignatures for life detection, and studies on the potential for life to adapt to challenges on Earth and in outer space.\n\nPlanetary science is the study of the assemblage of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being made.\n\nThe Solar System is subdivided into the inner planets, the asteroid belt, and the outer planets. The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The outer gas giant planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, and finally the Oort Cloud, which may extend as far as a light-year.\n\nThe planets were formed 4.6 billion years ago in the protoplanetary disk that surrounded the early Sun. Through a process that included gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of matter that, with time, became protoplanets. The radiation pressure of the solar wind then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many impact craters on the Moon. During this period, some of the protoplanets may have collided and one such collision may have formed the Moon.\n\nOnce a planet reaches sufficient mass, the materials of different densities segregate within, during planetary differentiation. This process can form a stony or metallic core, surrounded by a mantle and an outer crust. The core may include solid and liquid regions, and some planetary cores generate their own magnetic field, which can protect their atmospheres from solar wind stripping.\n\nA planet or moon's interior heat is produced from the collisions that created the body, by the decay of radioactive materials (\"e.g.\" uranium, thorium, and Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering.\n\nThe study of stars and stellar evolution is fundamental to our understanding of the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.\n\nAlmost all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were created inside the cores of stars.\n\nThe characteristics of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to evolve. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward while increasing its core density. The resulting red giant formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.\n\nThe final fate of the star depends on its mass, with stars of mass greater than about eight times the Sun becoming core collapse supernovae; while smaller stars blow off their outer layers and leave behind the inert core in the form of a white dwarf. The ejection of the outer layers forms a planetary nebula. The remnant of a supernova is a dense neutron star, or, if the stellar mass was at least three times that of the Sun, a black hole. Closely orbiting binary stars can follow more complex evolutionary paths, such as mass transfer onto a white dwarf companion that can potentially cause a supernova. Planetary nebulae and supernovae distribute the \"metals\" produced in the star by fusion to the interstellar medium; without them, all new stars (and their planetary systems) would be formed from hydrogen and helium alone.\nOur solar system orbits within the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy that is a prominent member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.\n\nIn the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, population I stars. The disk is surrounded by a spheroid halo of older, population II stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters.\n\nBetween the stars lies the interstellar medium, a region of sparse matter. In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.\n\nAs the more massive stars appear, they transform the cloud into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind one or more young open clusters of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way.\n\nKinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies have demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.\n\nAstrochemistry is the study of the abundance and reactions of molecules in the Universe, and their interaction with radiation. The discipline is an overlap of astronomy and chemistry. The word \"astrochemistry\" may be applied to both the Solar System and the interstellar medium. The study of the abundance of elements and isotope ratios in Solar System objects, such as meteorites, is also called cosmochemistry, while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of molecular gas clouds is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.\n\nStudies in this field contribute to the understanding of the formation of the solar system, Earth's origin and geology, abiogenesis, and the origin of climate and oceans.\n\nThe study of objects outside our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned with the formation and evolution of Galaxies, their morphology (description) and classification, the observation of active galaxies, and at a larger scale, the groups and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the latter is important for the understanding of the large-scale structure of the cosmos.\n\nMost galaxies are organized into distinct shapes that allow for classification schemes. They are commonly divided into spiral, elliptical and Irregular galaxies.\n\nAs the name suggests, an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.\n\nA spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.\n\nIrregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.\n\nAn active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.\n\nA radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include Seyfert galaxies, Quasars, and Blazars. Quasars are believed to be the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.\n\nThe large-scale structure of the cosmos is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies. This structure is organized into a hierarchy of groupings, with the largest being the superclusters. The collective matter is formed into filaments and walls, leaving large voids between.\n\nCosmology (from the Greek κόσμος (\"kosmos\") \"world, universe\" and λόγος (\"logos\") \"word, study\" or literally \"logic\") could be considered the study of the Universe as a whole.\nObservations of the large-scale structure of the Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded over the course of 13.8 billion years to its present condition. The concept of the big bang can be traced back to the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965.\n\nIn the course of this expansion, the Universe underwent several evolutionary stages. In the very early moments, it is theorized that the Universe experienced a very rapid cosmic inflation, which homogenized the starting conditions. Thereafter, nucleosynthesis produced the elemental abundance of the early Universe. (See also nucleocosmochronology.)\n\nWhen the first neutral atoms formed from a sea of primordial ions, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation. The expanding Universe then underwent a Dark Age due to the lack of stellar energy sources.\n\nA hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in the mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and are believed to have created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.\n\nGravitational aggregations clustered into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies. Over time, these pulled in more matter, and were often organized into groups and clusters of galaxies, then into larger-scale superclusters.\n\nVarious fields of physics are crucial to studying the universe. Interdisciplinary studies involve the fields of quantum mechanics, particle physics, plasma physics, condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, optics, and nuclear physics.\n\nFundamental to the structure of the Universe is the existence of dark matter and dark energy. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.\n\nAstronomy and astrophysics have developed significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Astrobiology is the study of the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.\n\nThe study of chemicals found in space, including their formation, interaction and destruction, is called astrochemistry. These substances are usually found in molecular clouds, although they may also appear in low temperature stars, brown dwarfs and planets. Cosmochemistry is the study of the chemicals found within the Solar System, including the origins of the elements and variations in the isotope ratios. Both of these fields represent an overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry. As \"forensic astronomy\", finally, methods from astronomy have been used to solve problems of law and history.\n\nAstronomy is one of the sciences to which amateurs can contribute the most.\n\nCollectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and a variety of deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.\n\nMost amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (\"e.g.\" the One-Mile Telescope).\n\nAmateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field of astronomy and it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.\n\nAlthough the scientific discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides in understanding the nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "566533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=566533", "title": "Blueshift", "text": "Blueshift\n\nA blueshift is any decrease in wavelength, with a corresponding increase in frequency, of an electromagnetic wave; the opposite effect is referred to as redshift. In visible light, this shifts the color from the red end of the spectrum to the blue end.\n\nDoppler blueshift is caused by movement of a source towards the observer. The term applies to any decrease in wavelength and increase in frequency caused by relative motion, even outside the visible spectrum. Only objects moving at near-relativistic speeds toward the observer are noticeably bluer to the naked eye, but the wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or other particle is shortened in the direction of travel.\n\nDoppler blueshift is used in astronomy to determine relative motion:\n\nUnlike the \"relative\" Doppler blueshift, caused by movement of a source towards the observer and thus dependent on the received angle of the photon, gravitational blueshift is \"absolute\" and does not depend on the received angle of the photon:\nIt is a natural consequence of conservation of energy and mass–energy equivalence, and was confirmed experimentally in 1959 with the Pound–Rebka experiment. Gravitational blueshift contributes to cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy via the Sachs–Wolfe effect: when a gravitational well evolves while a photon is passing, the amount of blueshift on approach will differ from the amount of gravitational redshift as it leaves the region.\n\nThere are faraway active galaxies that show a blueshift in their [O III] emission lines. One of the largest blueshifts is found in the narrow-line quasar, PG 1543+489, which has a relative velocity of -1150 km/s. These types of galaxies are called \"blue outliers\".\n\nIn a hypothetical universe undergoing a runaway big crunch contraction, a cosmological blueshift would be observed, with galaxies further away being increasingly blueshifted—the exact opposite of the actually observed cosmological redshift in the present expanding universe.\n\n"}

In the modern era systematic study of the process of breath-figures water condensation was carried out by Aitken and Rayleigh, among others. Half a century later the interest to the breath-figure formation was revived in a view of study of atmospheric processes, and in particular the extended study of a dew formation which turned out to be a complicated physical process. The experimental and theoretical study of dew formation has been carried out by Beysens. Thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of dew formation, which are crucial for understanding of formation of breath-figures inspired polymer patterns will be addressed further in detail. \n\nBreakthrough in the application of the breath-figures patterns was achieved in 1994–1995 when Widawski, François and Pitois reported manufacturing of polymer films with a self‐organized, micro-scaled, honeycomb morphology using the breath-figures condensation process. The reported process was based on the rapidly evaporated polymer solutions exerted to humidity. The  introduction into experimental techniques involved in manufacturing of micropatterned surfaces is supplied in reference 1; image representing typical breath-figures-inspired honeycomb pattern is shown in Figure 1. \n\nThe main physical processes involved in the process are: 1) evaporation of the polymer solution; 2) nucleation of water droplets; 3) condensation of water droplets; 4) growth of droplets; 5) evaporation of water; 6) solidification of polymer giving rise to the eventual micro-porous pattern. This experimental technique allows obtaining well-ordered, hierarchical, honeycomb surface patterns. A variety of experimental techniques were successfully exploited for the formation of breath-figures self-assembly induced patterns including drop-casting, dip-coating and spin-coating. Hierarchical patterning occurring under breath-figures self-assembly was reported.  The characteristic dimension of pores is usually close to 1 µm, whereas the characteristic lateral dimension of the large-scale patterns is ca. 10–50 µm.\n\n"}

This is popular in the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and Ireland.

DECC believed that collective switching had the ability to increase the competition for consumers within the energy market, particularly people who had never switched before and encouraging suppliers to innovate to acquire new customers.\n\nThe schemes are not directly regulated by energy industry regulator OFGEM, but they are indirectly through the supplier which \"wins\" any particular collective switch; as that supplier has obligations to the consumer under its supply licence conditions. Collective switches may also be run by Price Comparison Websites which can be accredited by OFGEM's confidence code, but the collective switch itself falls outside of this confidence code.\n\nCollective switching attempts to deliver the best tariff for a collection of disparate consumers that may have different usage patterns and priorities. It should not purport to deliver the cheapest deal to all participants as there are inevitably outliers that would obtain a better deal elsewhere. As the name suggests the emphasis is on collective rather than cheapest; although if the numbers of members are large enough and the remit of the collective switch is solely price then the associated deal may indeed be the cheapest deal at a point in time; but that is by no means certain. Collective switching can also apply to any type of tariff for which there is a collective need; green energy supply is an obvious example of a collective switch where the criteria that is not purely a function of cost.\n\n"}

Crowders Mountain was named for Crowders Creek which originated near its base. Contrary to some historical information, Crowders Mountain was not named for Ulrick Crowder (Ulrich Krauter). There is no historical evidence that he was ever in the immediate area. The cliffs are a popular destination for rock climbers.\n\nThe mountain itself is a monadnock, an isolated erosional remnant that rises abruptly from the surrounding plain. Geologically neither Crowders Mountain nor The Pinnacle are true mountains. Crowders Mountain sharply rises some above the surrounding countryside, and presents sheer rock cliffs that are 100 - in height. The mountain rises to above sea level. The peak is believed to be the remnant of a much higher mountain which formed some 400 - 500 million years ago and was gradually worn down by the elements. The park sets at the northeast end of the Kings Mountain Range, a long range of low peaks which include the site of the Battle of Kings Mountain of the American Revolution.\n\nThe Park contains two peaks:\n\nThe Visitors Center is located at 522 Park Office Ln, Kings Mountain, NC (704) 853-5375\n\nBuffalo herds grazed much of the land, which was prairie, before European settlers arrived.The Cherokee Indians had a trading route that crossed Crowders Mountain, and the peaks marked boundaries between the hunting lands of the Catawba and Cherokee Indians.\n\nIn the early 1970s a mining company conducted exploratory sampling on the mountain as preparation to purchase the mineral rights. Thanks to grassroots efforts by local citizens, educational institutions, and organizations the state government was convinced that the area should be set aside and protected due to significant natural communities, plants and animals, intrinsic beauty, and unique recreational opportunities. In 1973 the State of North Carolina officially designated the area as Crowders Mountain State Park and it opened to the public in 1974. The Pinnacle was added to the park in 1987.

After witnessing Hades's abduction of the goddess Persephone and trying to prevent it, she was turned to liquid by Hades.\n\nCyane had as a partner the river god Anapos (or Anapis).

It takes its name from Mount Darwin in the West Coast Range, where it was first reported, and later gave its name to Darwin Crater, a probable impact crater, and the inferred source of the glass.\n\nFragments of Darwin glass are found scattered over a 410 km² (160 miles squared) area. Such an area is called a strewn field. On slopes and flat ground between 250 and 500 m elevation, the glass occurs with quartzite fragments buried under peat and soil. The peat is normally around 20 cm thick, and the quartzite fragment horizon is typically 30 cm thick. On mountain peaks higher than 500 m, the bedrock is directly exposed to the air, and Darwin glass occurs occasionally on the surface. In valleys below 220 m the Darwin glass is buried below peat and sediments. The glass occurs north, west and south from the crater. Its distribution extends to Kelly Basin and the lower northeast shore of Macquarie Harbour. Northwards it extends almost to the Lyell Highway and Crotty Dam. Darwin glass is rare in the crater itself.\n\nIn controlled excavations of gravel deposits the abundance of Darwin glass was found to vary from 0.3 to 47 kg/m³. The highest abundance was found about 2 km from the crater, with the average abundance estimated at 3.4 kg/m³ of gravel over a 50 km² study area near the crater. From this it can be estimated that about 25000 tons of Darwin glass, or about 10000 m³, occurs in this 50 km² area. The amount of glass is large compared with the size of the crater. Preservation is helped by acid ground water which does not dissolve the glass, but this alone cannot explain the glass abundance. There is so much glass present that the glass must have been more copiously produced than in other meteorite impacts of similar size. \nThe glass is light to dark green, white or black. The glass takes the form of twisted masses, fragments or chunks up to 10 cm. Internally it has a flowing texture defined by lines of elliptical bubbles.\nThere are two kinds of Darwin glass when composition is measured. Type 1 is normally white or green whereas type 2 is normally black to dark green. The dark glass contains less silica and more magnesium and iron than the light green glass. The dark glass is also enriched in chromium, nickel and cobalt. A possible explanation for the chemical differences is that, in addition to being mainly composed of melted local metamorphic rocks, the type 2 glass also contains a component of extraterrestrial material from the meteorite.\nDarwin glass has been dated at about 816,000 years old using argon dating methods.\n\nThe glass is an impactite resulting from the melting of local rocks due to the impact of a large meteorite. The assumed source is a 1.2-kilometer-wide topographic depression known as Darwin Crater. The crater is filled with 230 m of sediments and breccia. A crater of that size would be created by a meteorite 20 to 50 m in diameter and its impact with Earth would release 20 megatons of energy.\n\n"}

Their total capacity was about 5900 megawatts. 90 percent of electricity production in Azerbaijan accounts for TPPs, and 10 percent for hydroelectric power stations. \n\nThe Energy Regulatory Agency under the Ministry of Energy was established on the basis of the Department for State Energy And Gas Supervision of the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Azerbaijan by the Decree of president dated December 22, 2017, and its charter was approved.\n\nAccording to the World Energy Trilemma İndex, compiled by the World Energy Council for 2017, Azerbaijan has taken the 31st place (BBA) among 125 countries. \n\nAccording to the Global Energy Architecture Performance Index report 2017, compiled by the World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan ranked 36th out of 127 countries with 0.67 score. \n\nAccording to 2016 report of organization that mentioned above, Azerbaijan ranked 32th out of 126 countries with 0.68 score. Economic growth and development was 0,68 score, environmental sustainability 0.57 score, energy access and security 0.79 score.\n\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Azerbaijan accounted for half of the world’s oil production . Oil wells have been operating in Baku since the 1840s. Well before the famous discovery of oil in a drilled well in Pennsylvania by Edwin Drake in 1859, Azerbaijan had drilled its first oil well in Bibi-Heybat (settlement of Baku) in 1846. As of the early 21st century, almost all production came from off shore in the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan was one of only four former Soviet republics (along with Russian, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan) to be self-sufficient in petroleum. However, production declined following the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union until foreign investment provided the capital for new development, turning this trend around in 1998. Production rose from in 1998 to an average of in 2004.\n\nAccording to industry journals and government sources, proven oil reserves as of 2004 totaled between 7 billion and . The State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) has planned for joint development of the off shore fields (which are now largely untapped) and has entered into several agreements to build oil pipelines. For instance, a project with the Caspian Pipeline Consortium would carry oil from the Caspian Sea to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. Another deal with Turkey involved the construction of a 1,760 km pipeline, the symbolic first length of which was installed in September 2002, to carry crude oil from Baku to Ceyhan, Turkey. In 1995 Azerbaijan had 17 offshore oil fields in production. Guneshli, about 96 km off the Azeri coast, currently accounts for more than half the annual production. By the end of 2002, 33 companies in 15 foreign countries had signed agreements to develop 21 major oil fields in Azerbaijan. As of 2003 disputes over off shore oil rights in the Caspian Sea continued to hinder development of those reserves. \n\nFrom 1987 to 1993, production deceased from 13.8 million tons of oil and 12.5 billion cubic meters gas to 10.3 million tons of oil and 6.8 billion cubic meters of gas. The annual rate of decline in production was 7.1% for oil and 13.5% for gas. The exploratory drilling decreased by 17 times, or by 170,000 meters, was 10,000 meters in 1995 compared to 1970. \n\n\"Shah Deniz-2\" energy strategic projects is the energy security and energy diversification project.\n\nContract of the Shah Deniz gas field was signed in 1996, and the first pipeline connecting the Caspian Sea with the Georgian side of the Black Sea coast was built in 1999. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan main oil export pipeline connecting the Caspian Sea with the Mediterranean and international markets was built in 2006 , and the Southern Gas Pipeline in 2007. \n\nThe 2013 report by UK-based Global Witness NGO revealed that companies working in Azerbaijan’s oil industry have no transparency and accountability. It has been documented that millions of dollars of revenue disappear into the hands of obscurely owned private companies that cooperate with SOCAR.\n\nThe report concluded that the opacity of the deals struck by Socar \"is systemic\" and added, \n“These findings should be of great concern to the international community as a whole. Oil and its derivative products are central to the Azerbaijani economy, making up 95% of exports in 2011. It is important for Europe that Azerbaijan keeps the oil and gas flowing and maintains a transparent and well-run energy industry. Yet this briefing shows that much of the oil business in Azerbaijan remains opaque, and corruption is still perceived to be at epidemic levels…\"\n\nNatural gas production has become more important in recent years, especially in Baku, where some of the oil wells have been exhausted. Proven reserves as of late 2004 totaled 1.37 trillion cubic metres. Production of natural gas in 2011 totaled 17.66 billion cubic metres. Ukraine and Iran are interested in running a natural gas pipeline through Azerbaijan en route to Eastern Europe.\n\nOn March 10, 2016, Natiq Aliyev, Azerbaijani energy minister, publicly said that Azerbaijan has enough gas reserves to fill the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). The SGC is an energy project whose goal is to move 10 billion cub meters of gas from Azerbaijan through Georgia and Turkey to Europe.\n\n\nIn 2011, net electricity generation was estimated at 19.44 billion kWh. In 2011, consumption of electricity was estimated at 13.57 billion kWh. Total installed capacity at the beginning of 2011 was 6.392 million kW. Eight thermal plants supply more than 80% of capacity, and the rest comes from 5 hydroelectric plants. The main power plants (both are thermal) were near Ali Bairamly (1,100 MW) and Mingechaur (2,100 MW).\n\nThe power of the country's electroenergy system has reached 7,172.6 MW. Currently, the system's capacity is 5200 MW and the peak power required is around 3750-3900 MW. In 2017, the production of electricity amounted to 22 209.8 million kWh including 20 445.4 million kWh at thermal power plants and 1 732.8 million kWh of electricity at hydroelectric power stations and totally decreased by 2.0% compared to the corresponding period of 2016 (22 665.7 million kWh).\n\nTotally 4778.8 million cubic meters of natural gas and 311.5 thousand tons of mazut were used for electricity generation during the year.\n\n50 MVA transformer with 110/35 kV, two 110 kV circuit breakers and 35 kV electrical equipment were installed at Hoca Hasan substation of Binagadi district. 110 kV double-circuit transmission line between 110 kV \"Liman\" and \"White City\" substations, three transformer substations with 35 / 0,4 kV were constructed.\n\nIn 2017, oil production amounted to around 38.7 million tons in the country. 28.9 million tons of extracted oil belonged to the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli, 2.4 million tons to Shah deniz (condensate) and 7.4 million tons to the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic.\n\nIn 2017, President Ilham Aliyev took part in the opening of the following substations: \n\n\n\nPetroleum and natural gas resources are the basis for an extensive system of refineries, which produce gasoline, herbicides, fertilizers, kerosene, synthetic rubber, and plastics.\n\nIn January 2015, the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, announced that he would direct his government to create programs to bring investment dollars to industries other than oil. Specifically, President Aliyev cited industrial and agricultural industries as an example.\n\nAliyev cited Azerbaijani’s economy by saying, “That’s why it’s much easier to attract investments to stable countries with socio-political stability and information growth.” He said that the banking industry will become more important in helping develop the country’s non-energy industries.\n\n"}

Almost half (48%) of DEI's power output is generated using lignite, a drop from the 51.6% in 2009.\n\n12% of Greece's electricity comes from hydroelectric power plants and another 20% from natural gas. Between 2009 and 2010, independent companies' energy production increased by 56%, from 2,709 Gigawatt hour in 2009 to 4,232 GWh in 2010.\n\nIn line with the European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece aims to get 18% of its overall energy from renewable sources by 2020. In 2015, according to the independent power transmission operator in Greece (ΑΔΜΗΕ) more than 20% of the electricity in Greece has been produced from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric powerplants. This percentage in April reached 50%. The same trend was the case also for 2016 .\n\nThe contribution of RES (non-hydroelectric) to the gross final electricity consumption accounted for 24.5% in 2016, while hydroelectric power represented approximately 25% by installed capacity. According to the Greek Electricity Market Operator (LAGIE), the total installed capacity in the Greek interconnected system at the end of 2016 accounted for almost 16,615 MW, including 3,912 MW lignite, 4,658 MW natural gas, 3,173 MW large hydro-power and 4,873 MW RES. \n\nGreece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation, however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin.\n\nGreece has 10 million barrels of proved oil reserves as of 1 January 2011. Hellenic Petroleum is the country's largest oil company, followed by Motor Oil Hellas. Greece's oil production stands at 7,946 barrels per day (bbl/d), ranked 90th, while it exports 1,863 bbl/d (57th) and imports 496,600 bbl/d (25th).\n\nIn 2011 the Greek government approved the start of oil exploration and drilling in three locations within Greece, with an estimated output of 250 to 300 million barrels over the next 15 to 20 years. The estimated output in Euros of the three deposits is €25 billion over a 15-year period, of which €13–€14 billion will enter state coffers. Greece's dispute with Turkey over the Aegean poses substantial obstacles to oil exploration in the Aegean Sea.\n\nIn addition to the above, Greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the Ionian Sea as well as the Libyan Sea, within the Greek exclusive economic zone, south of Crete. The Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Climate Change announced that there was interest from various countries (including Norway and the United States) in exploration, and the first results regarding the amount of oil and gas in these locations are expected in the summer of 2012.\n\nA number of oil and gas pipelines are currently under construction or under planning in the country. Such projects include the \"Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy\" (ITGI) and \"South Stream\" gas pipelines.\n\nThe Turkey–Greece pipeline is a long natural gas pipeline, which connects Turkish and Greek gas grids completed in September 2007.\n\nMegalopoli Mine is a large lignite and coal mine owned by the Public Power Corporation of Greece. The largest lignite and coal mine in Greece are in the area of Western Macedonia and especially in Ptolemaida.\n\nIn a summary, the Greek energy market situation regarding the production of energy from biomass is presented. EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC requires the EU to fulfill at least 20% of its total energy needs with renewable by 2020.

Commercial foam rubbers are generally made of either polyurethane or natural latex. Latex foam rubber, used in mattresses, is well known for its endurance. Polyurethane is a thermosetting polymer that comes from combination of Methyl di-isocyanate and polyethylene and some other chemical additives. \n\nFoam rubber was first produced in 1929 by Dunlop Rubber researcher chemists E. A. Murphy and Eric Owen using whipped latex. In 1937 isocyanate based materials were first used for the formation of foam rubbers, after World War II styrene-butadiene rubber replaced many natural types of foam. Foam rubbers have been used commercially for a wide range of applications since around the 1940s. \n\nPolyether polyurethane rubber was discovered and patented in the 1950s by Charles C. Price. Currently, polyurethane-based foams make up over 90%, by weight, of the entire market for polyurethanes. The largest amount of polyurethane is used by these industries: construction, transportation, home furniture, noise and vibration reduction, and carpet. Construction uses 27% of polyurethane, and transportation uses 21%. Flexible foam is the leading material usage at 44% total volume, and rigid foam material at 28% of the United States market.\n\nRates of polymerization can range from many minutes to just a few seconds. Fast reacting polymers feature short cycle periods and require the use of machinery to thoroughly mix the reacting agents. Slow polymers may be mixed by hand, but require long periods on mixing, as a result industrial application tends to use machinery to mix products. Product processing can range from a variety of techniques including, but not limited to spraying, open pouring, and molding.\n\nThe main physical properties of foam rubber are generalized as being “Lightweight, buoyant, cushioning performance, thermal and acoustic insulation, impact damping and cost reduction”. Crosslinking technology is used in the formation of EVA based foams, including LLDPE, LDPE, HDPE, PP, and TPE. Crosslinking is the most important characteristic in the production of foam rubber to obtain the best possible foam expansion and physical properties. Crosslinking is defined as chemical bonding between polymer chains, and is used for foam rubber manufacturing to stabilize bubble expansion, enhanced resistance to thermal collapse and improve physical properties.\n\nDue to the variety in polyurethane chemistries, it is difficult to recycle foam materials using a single method. Reusing slab stock foams for carpet backing is how the majority of recycling is done. This method involves shredding the scrap and bonding the small flakes together to form sheets. Other methods involve breaking the foam down into granules and dispersing them into a polyol blend to be molded into the same part as the original. The recycling process is still ever developing for foam rubber and the future will hopefully unveil new and easier ways for recycling.\n\n"}

She has studied saxophone and composition in Oslo, Birmingham, London, New York and Buenos Aires. Aagre was awarded the Norwegian Government scholarship for the year 2005/2006.\n\nAagre released her first album \"Katalyze\" in 2004 with Frøy Aagre Offbeat, including Andreas Ulvo, Freddy Augdal and Roger Williamsen, and attracted notice throughout Europe, and soon found herself invited to perform at major festivals in Europe, North America and India. There after followed \"Countryside\" (2006) and \"Cycle of Silence\" (2010) both receiving great reviews. When attending the Banff Jazz Workshop in Canada, in 2005, Aagre started a collaboration with the Brisbane band Misinterprotato (now known as Trichotomy). This led to touring with the trio, including an appearance at Wangaratta Jazz Festival in 2009.\n\nHere is the liner notes for the latest album Frøy Aagre Electric: The name Frøy Aagre Electric refers to the new setup with Fender Rhodes Electric Piano, effects and bass synth as opposed to the previous setup of merely acoustic instruments. This album is divided into two parts; following is a description of part 1, the main section of the album (track 1–6). Part 2 is the three duo pieces at the end (track 7–9).\n\nWhilst the previous album, \"Cycle of Silence\" explored the use of silence in music, this album goes in the opposite direction, exploring energy, vitality, rhythmic drive and musical playfulness.\nThe focus during the compositional process, the rehearsal period, recording session and the mixing process was to create musical momentum; by making the music constantly move and flow between different sections and contrasting moods, creating tension and relief by using various instrumentations, electronic sounds and dynamics. The focus during the recording session itself was to capture the electric live energy in the studio.\n\nWhereas previous albums have been acoustic, melodic jazz with occasional hints of classical and world music, my change of musical preferences and the entry of electronic sounds have added influence from pop and electronica to the music.\nThis album is groundbreaking and a game changer for me. Entering the world of electronic sounds has broadened my musical horizon and opened doors to new genres to mix and play with as part of my musical pallet, yet not being totally devoted to any.\n\nI strive to maintain a balance between spontaneity and structure, bridging the gap between the composed and the improvised by making it part of the same overall form. As always I care a lot about the melodies, but this time in combination with a stronger focus on rhythmic drive. Choosing the right musicians for your music is important to make your music blossom and Andreas and Jonas have contributed tremendously to the musical expression of this album. I would also like to mention the wonderful guests who has lifted the music further and broadened the range of sounds.\n\nThe album itself is a journey, like snapshots of my life; \"Berlin\", composed in this thrilling city, one of my favourites in Europe and \"City Lights\" inspired by the urban pulse and uplifting energy of big capital cities. “Castle in the Air”, is written to Andreas Ulvo, my musical soul mate over the last 10 years, and was a tune that created spontaneous energetic moments in the recording studio.\n“Birds, Bees and Forest Trees” is inspired by a particularly beautiful walk in the woods, \"Entanglement\" is about the close relationships in life and the playful \"African Wig\", with African music influences recalls moments from my African tour.\nThe album ends in quiet contemplation with three duo pieces, of which Youth and Loss 77 is heavily influenced in the aftermath of the national tragedy of 22 July 2011.\n\nThis is the inspiration behind the compositions, but I hope you make the music your own and connect it to your life and experiences.\n\n\n\n"}

Its first experimental observation took place in 1997-1998 on the newly built high-speed railway line in Sweden (from Gothenburg to Malmo) for high-speed trains X 2000. At some locations along this line characterised by very soft ground (near Ledsgard) the Rayleigh wave velocity was as low as 45 m/s, and train speeds of only 165–170 km/h were sufficient to observe the effect. In particular, the increase in train speeds from 140 to 180 km/h was accompanied by about tenfold increase in generated ground vibration level, which agrees with the theory. It is now understood that, with the increase of operating train speeds, this phenomenon represents a major environmental problem associated with building new high-speed railway lines.\n\nThe most efficient way to mitigate ground vibration boom is to reduce train speeds at locations where Rayleigh wave velocities in the ground are very low. If this is not desirable, e.g. for economic reasons, some mitigation measures can be applied, such as stiffening of railway embankments or building protective trenches and barriers between railways and residential or industrial buildings. Any mitigation measures would involve the specific ground investigation works along the route.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50274456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50274456", "title": "HUMARA assay", "text": "HUMARA assay\n\nHUMARA Assay is one of the most widely used methods to determine the clonal origin of a tumor. The method is based on X chromosome inactivation and it takes the advantage of having different methylation status of a gene called HUMARA (short for Human Androgen receptor) that is located on X chromosome. Considering the fact that once one X chromosome is inactivated in a cell, all other cells derived from it will have the same X chromosome inactivated, this approach becomes a great tool to differentiate a monoclonal population from a polyclonal one in a female tissue. HUMARA gene, in particular, has three important features that make it highly convenient for the purpose.\n\n1-) The gene is located on X chromosome and it goes through inactivation by methylation in normal embryogenesis of a female infant. The fact that most-but not all-genes on X chromosome undergo inactivation, this feature becomes an important one.\n\n2-) Human Androgen Receptor gene alleles have varying numbers of CAG repeats. Thus, when DNA from a healthy female tissue is amplified by PCR for a specific region of the gene, two separated bands can be seen on the gel.\n\n3-) The region that is amplified by PCR also has certain base orders that make it susceptible to be digested by HpaII (or HhaI) enzyme when it is not methylated. This detail gives the opportunity to researchers to differentiate a methylated allele from the unmethylated one.\n\nThanks to these qualities of HUMARA gene, clonal origin of any tissue from a female mammalian organism can be determined.\n\nThe basic process is performed as the following :\n\n1-) DNA from the tissue is isolated.\n\n2-) The isolated DNA is treated with the suitable enzyme (such as HpaII) in optimal conditions for a suggested amount of time (i.e. overnight).\n\n3-) DNA is cleaned and the certain region of HUMARA gene is amplified by PCR using \"suitable\" primers (as an example, please see:Ref.2)\n\n4-) After running PCR products through a gel, the gel is visualized and the results are analyzed accordingly. If two bands are apparent, the tissue studied is most likely of polyclonal origin. If a single band is observed, the tissue is monoclonal unless two alleles have exactly the same numbers of CAG repeats or different cells with the same inactivated initiated the tumor; so, seemingly monoclonal although it is actually polyclonal.\n\nIn order to make a conclusion about the clonality of a tumor, it is best to use the DNA from a normal tissue of the same person, and a sample without enzyme treatment must also be amplified as a control. If, even in normal tissues without enzyme treatment, a single band is observed, it may be explained as follows; this person has the genetic pattern as XO (this possibility can be excluded to see a band after enzyme treatment because, if indeed XO is the genetic pattern of the sample, then, there will be NO methylation, therefore no band should be visible after digesting with the enzyme. In the case of seeing a band after enzyme treatment, the observation is most likely to mean that the person has two X chromosomes with exact CAG repeats.) When you see two bands for normal tissue (both enzyme treated and untreated), and you see two bands for enzyme treated tumor sample but two bands for untreated tumor DNA, then you are surely looking at a polyclonal tumor. However, if you see the same number of bands only with a single band after enzyme treatment, there is a rather high chance for the tumor of your interest to be monoclonal. In this last case, monoclonality is not for sure because, as stated earlier, there is the possibility of having exact same -CAG- repeats on both alleles.\n"}

The region is divided into several smaller magmatic provinces. Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, Sverdrup Basin, Amerasian Basin, and northern Greenland (Peary Land) are some of the larger divisions. Today, HALIP covers an area greater than , making it one of the largest and most intense magmatic complexes on the planet. However, eroded volcanic sediments in sedimentary strata in Svalbard and Franz Josef Land suggest that an extremely large portion of HALIP volcanics have already been eroded away.\n\nThe HALIP event lasted from 130 million years ago to approximately 60 million years ago. During its active period, there were two distinct phases of volcanism. The first phase lasted from 130 million years ago to 80 million years ago and was characterized by tholeiitic igneous activity. During this time, numerous dikes and sills formed, and there were eruptions of basaltic flow. The basalts formed at this time are relatively rich in TiO and have a similar composition to continental flood basalts. The second phase lasted from approximately 85 million years ago to 60 million years ago and was characterized by mildly alkaline igneous activity and the eruption of flood basalts. The igneous rocks formed during the second phase have a similar geochemical makeup as the intra-plate composition.\n\nThe Arctic Ocean is a few hundred million years old, making it the youngest ocean on Earth. In the Precambrian, when the Arctic was located south of the Equator, the continent Arctica (or Arctida) filled the gap between the cratons that today surround the Arctic region. Arctica rifted apart in the Late Precambrian (950 Ma) and was reassembled in a new configuration in the Late Paleozoic (255 Ma).\n\nDuring the Jurassic-Cretaceous this second continent, known as Pangea, broke apart, opening the Amerasian Basin and the Arctic Ocean. HALIP dispersed the components of this second continent around the margins of the Arctic Ocean where they are now terranes and microplates embedded into fold belts or overlain by sediments. As the Atlantic and Arctic oceans opened during the Mesozoic and into the Cenozoic, the Arctic Region underwent several stages of rifting, sedimentation, and magmatism.\n\nDolerites collected from Svalbard and elsewhere in the Arctic are mafic intra-plate tholeiites characteristic of HALIP, which indicated that the LIP formed during the opening of the Arctic Ocean around 148–70 Ma. Seismic and magnetic analyses of the seafloor produced ages of 118–83 Ma.\n\nThe HALIP is widely thought to have originated from a mantle plume, and the igneous activity of the province often tracked along a similar path as the Icelandic hotspot.\n\nThe HALIP is divided into several magmatic provinces. These provinces are divided by location, igneous rock composition, and the formations present.\n\nIn the Svalbard province, the HALIP is expressed as an extensive system of alkaline intrusive doleritic rocks. The intrusions largely appear in the form of sills that can reach thicknesses of and continuously extend for up to laterally. The basaltic rocks found in Svalbard have an intra-plate composition and are though to originate from a source near the Alpha Ridge. The Svalbard province is also closely associated with the Franz Josef Land province (discussed below). The two provinces combined cover an area of approximately .\n\nThe Franz Josef Land province is closely associated with the Svalbard province. Franz Josef Land is located approximately east of Svalbard and contains igneous rocks of very similar composition to those of Svalbard. However, the archipelago is scattered with a prominent swarm of southeast trending dikes. Extensive sills and volcanic flows can also be found in the region, as well as a few dikes of other trends. The timing of the Franz Josef Land formations and the Svalbard formations is thought to be nearly identical, furthering the evidence for a large initial plume head model for the HALIP.\n\nThe Sverdrup Basin province spreads across the Canadian Arctic Islands. The region is characterized by the presence of a radiating dike swarm across the Queen Elizabeth Islands that seems to suggest the presence of a mantle plume beneath the Alpha Ridge. This province contains igneous rocks of both tholeiitic and alkaline composition. There are also a respectable number of sills and flood basalts in the province. The flood basalts in the Canadian Arctic Islands are similar to those of the Columbia River flood basalts in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The Sverdrup Basin Magmatic Province covers an area of .\n\nThe Amerasian Basin’s most prominent feature is the Alpha Ridge – which is thought to be the location of the mantle plume that fed the HALIP. The ridge reaches a height of from the seafloor. Also in the region are a few basaltic dikes. The Amerasian Basin extends over .\n\nThe northern Greenland province, also known as Peary Land, contains three dike swarms. The Nansen Land swarm trends SSE-SE and is the oldest of the swarms. The middle-aged swarm is known as the Erlandsen Swarm and trends SE-ESE. The J. P. Koch Swarm is the youngest of the three and trends eastward. The two younger swarms tend to have igneous rocks of alkaline composition, while the Nansen Land swarm tends to have more tholeiitic composition. The Peary Land province covers an area of over .\n\nThe Barents Sea province is characterized by igneous intrusions with much similarity to Svalbard and Franz-Josef Land. This region is well known for being petroleum-rich. The Barents Sea province covers an area of .\n\nLarge igneous provinces such as HALIP are thought to have caused global climate change. Late Cretaceous (92–86 Ma) vertebrates, including long champsosaurs, a crocodile-like reptile, found in the Canadian Arctic suggests that polar climate was much warmer during the Cretaceous when average annual temperature must have exceeded 14 °C.\n\nThe BLIP intrusions could have released perhaps of carbon from the contact aureoles which could have triggered the Aptian oceanic anoxic event (OAE1a) at 120 Ma.\n\n\n"}

Scientific drilling is a critical tool in understanding of Earth processes and structure. It provides direct insight into Earth processes and critically tests geological models. Results obtained from drilling projects at critical sites can be applied to other areas worldwide. It is, therefore, believed that international cooperation in continental scientific drilling is an essential component for a responsible management strategy for the Earth's natural resources and environment.\n\nThe ICDP was founded in February 1996 in the German Embassy in Tokyo as a result of the German Continental Deep Drilling Program (KTB; 1987-1995). The serves as the headquarters for both the current ICDP and the former KTB project.\n\nICDP supports international science teams with a proven need for continental-based drilling. The proposed projects help to answer societal challenges related to dynamics of planet Earth, contributing to major advances in understanding Earth’s environment and life, sustainable geo- and energy resources, as well as safeguarding from natural disasters.\n\nICDP proposals seek to help understand how both the climate and the environment have changed on global and regional scales. Areas of research within this theme include paleoclimate studies investigating the manner in which Earth’s past climate has changed, the reasons for such changes, as well as the role of environmental forcing in human evolution, for example in the Eastern Rift Valley of Africa. Other ICDP proposals focus on the effects of volcanism and major impacts on climate and mass extinctions. Deep biosphere research has also become an important component of drilling projects to help get a better understanding of evolution and extent of life on Earth. Other proponents of deep-life that coincide with ICDP goals include addressing metabolic rates, carbon cycling, and energy sources of subsurface microbial activity, how microbial life has adapted to the more extreme conditions of subsurface habitats, and the role of the deep biosphere on the geosphere and atmosphere.\n\nThere is a rise in demand for renewable and clean energy resources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Knowing the composition, structure and evolution of Earth’s crust can help to understand how best to manage and use Earth's resources and environment. Research is needed in this area to determine sustainable practices in exploring and exploiting natural resources. ICDP undertakes a variety of scientific drilling projects to study the origin of mineral resources and to discover new unconventional resources such as gas hydrates and geothermal energy.\n\nResearch areas within sustainable georesources include the nature of the deep biosphere and its relation to geologic processes such as hydrocarbon maturation, ore deposition and energy resources, the origin and evolution of sedimentary basins and hydrocarbon resources, and the role of various geologic settings, including volcanoes and plate boundaries, in ore deposit formation. Other georesource studies include understanding the stresses, such as urbanization and sea-level-rise, on freshwater resources and heat and mass transfer. The transfer of heat and mass, i.e. magma, hot fluids, groundwater and sediment, controls the concentration of metals and hydrocarbons as well as providing renewable geothermal energy resources.\n\nICDP has accepted many proposals related to formation, potential hazard, and mitigation associated with fault boundaries, volcanoes, impact structures and plate margins. Topics include, but are not limited to, earthquakes generated on fault boundaries like San Andreas Fault and North Anatolian Fault Zone, geophysical and geochemical properties of different volcanic sources, impact basin evolution and effect on Earth’s environment and ecology, and tsunamis generation.\n\nThe International Continental Scientific Drilling Program accepts proposals each year by Jan 15th from individual or groups of scientists from member countries (See Members). Proposals are selected based primarily on scientific merits and expected impacts. The steps from project to proposal include submission of a pre-proposal letter by the Principal Investigators followed by the development of Workshop Proposal and Full Proposal if the pre-proposal is recommended.\n\nCurrently, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States and UNESCO are members of the ICDP.\n\n\n"}

Based at Western Michigan University in the United States, the ISCSC holds an annual conference and publishes the journal \"Comparative Civilizations Review\".\n\nIn October 1961, in Salzburg, Austria, an extraordinary group of scholars gathered to create the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations. Among the 26 founding members from Austria, Germany, France, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Spain, Italy, England, Russia, the United States, China and Japan were such luminaries as Pitirim Sorokin and Arnold Toynbee. For six days, the participants debated such topics as the definition of “civilization,” problems in the analysis of complex cultures, civilizational encounters in the past, the Orient versus the Occident, problems of universal history, theories of historiography, and the role of the “human sciences” in “globalization.” The meeting was funded by the Austrian government, in cooperation with UNESCO, and received considerable press coverage. Sorokin was elected the Society’s first president. After several meetings in Europe, the advancing age of its founding members and the declining health of then president, Othmar F. Anderle, were important factors in the decision to transfer the Society to the United States. Between 1968 and 1970 Roger Williams Wescott of Drew University facilitated that transition. In 1971, the first annual meeting of the ISCSC (US) was held in Philadelphia. Important participants in that meeting and in the Society’s activities during the next years included Benjamin Nelson (the Society’s first American president), Roger Wescott, Vytautas Kavolis, Matthew Melko, David Wilkinson, Rushton Coulborn and C.P.

{"id": "35305141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35305141", "title": "International communication", "text": "International communication\n\nInternational communication (also referred to as the \"study of global communication\" or transnational communication) is the communication practice that occurs across international borders. The need for international communication was due to the increasing effects and influences of globalization. As a field of study, international communication is a branch of communication studies, concerned with the scope of \"government-to-government\", \"business-to-business\", and \"people-to-people\" interactions at a global level. Currently, international communication is being taught at colleges across the United States. Due to the increasingly globalized market, employees who possess the ability to effectively communicate across cultures are in high demand. International communication \"encompasses political, economic, social, cultural and military concerns\".\n\nEfficient communication networks played crucial roles in establishing ancient imperial authority and international trade. The extent of empire could be used as an 'indication of the efficiency of communication'. Ancient empires such as Rome, Persia and China, all utilized writing in collecting information and dispersing, creating enormous postal and dispatch systems. As early as in fifteenth century, news had been disseminated trans-nationally in Europe. 'The wheat traders of Venice, the silver traders of Antwerp, the merchants of Nuremberg and their trading partners shared economic newsletters and created common values and beliefs in the rights of capital.'\n\nIn 1837, Samuel Morse invented telegraph. Given its speed and reliability in delivering information, telegraph offered opportunities for capital and military expansion. As showed in Table 1.1, the establishment of cable hardware signifies global power order in late nineteenth and early twentieth century.\n\nTable 1.1 Cabling the world\nThe newspaper industry and international telegraph networks mutually facilitated each other. As the supply and demand of newspaper industry rapidly increased in nineteenth century, news agencies were established successively. The French Havas Agency was founded in 1835, the German agency Wolffin 1849 and the British Reuters in 1851. These three European agencies, which started to operate internationally, were all subsidized by their respective governments.\n\nWestern countries seized the chances to implement radio communication after the first radio transmissions of human voice in 1902. But the two mechanisms of radio broadcasting were distinctively different. In the USA, the Radio Act of 1927 confirm its status as an advertising-funded commercial enterprise, while in Britain, the public broadcasting pioneer British Broadcasting Corporation set up in the same year. During the First World War and the Second World War, radio broadcasting played a significant role in both domestic public opinion management and international diplomacy propaganda abroad. Even in the Cold War times, this radio-dominated international communication still featured in propaganda respective ideologies. The prominent example is the Voice of America, which ran a global network to indoctrinate \"American dream\" to its international audience.\n\nSince the cold war officially ended in 1990, the intense relations of super powers halted with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the emergence of the Third World countries, the unequally developed communication order can no longer exist. The Third World called for ceasing their marginalized communication status. Especially when international communications stepped into the information age, 'the convergence of telecommunication and computing and the ability to move all type of data – pictures, words, sounds – via the Internet have revolutionized international information exchange.'\n\nWhen communicating internationally it is important to take culture into consideration. Though English has become the language of business, many businesses fail to recognize that the language used does not determine how business is conducted. Therefore, it is important to understand that intercultural and international communication are interchangeable.\n\nAs a tourist it may be acceptable to maintain the cultural norms from a country of origin when visiting, though attempting to adapt would be appreciated. However, when conducting business it is important to recognize cultural differences, especially when communicating. At the turn of the century there was a large amount of research based on the needs of those that travel abroad in order to commercialize products or services. The list of researchers includes Hofstede, 1991; Storti, 1994; Ansari & Jackson, 1995; Cushner & Brislin, 1996; Adler, 1997; Mead, 1998; and Marx, 1999. From those studies Gibson's volume becomes an important source of information for business professionals interested in succeeding internationally. As explained by Douglas Storey, there was a change in style and strategy of American diplomacy since 1979 after the first addition of Glen Fisher's book appeared.\n\nDespite the reason for international communication it is important to understand that international communication is not limited to the language spoken during communication.\n\nInternational communication is widely spread and multilayered in contemporary society, however it is not considered as a separate academic discipline because of its overlapping with other subjects.

Early home movies show him training for a life at sea, climbing a telephone pole in his backyard, and wrestling & Jiu Jitsu to prepare for the inevitable fights he believed would occur due to his reading the novels of Jack London and Joseph Conrad.\n\nJohnson became a professional sailor (joining the Merchant Marine in 1926) working summers as crew and captain of various yachts including the \"Charmian\" for Newcomb Carlton (President of Western Union.), which led to the opportunity to sail on the \"Peking.\" He was an amateur filmmaker and his footage on the barque \"Peking\" in 1929 would become the now famous film \"Around Cape Horn\".\n\nWhile serving as mate on board the \"Wanderbird\", Johnson met (Harriet) Electa \"Exy\" Search whom he married in 1932. The Johnsons circumnavigated the world seven times on two vessels, both named \"Yankee\", each trip with a new crew and each taking approximately 18 months. The first \"Yankee\", bought in 1933, was a Dutch North Sea pilot schooner.\nThe second \"Yankee\", bought in 1947, was a retired German North Sea pilot schooner which the Johnsons rerigged as a brigantine.\nThey then retired from circumnavigation and, in 1958-9, had the last \"Yankee\" built at Westhaven in Zaandam, the Netherlands. She was a steel ketch for sailing the inland waterways of Europe, designed by Irving Johnson and Olin Stephens of Sparkman & Stephens.\n\nMany of the Johnsons' voyages have been documented in their own books and many articles and videos produced by the National Geographic Society and others throughout their sailing career. With an amateur crew, they traveled hundreds of thousands of miles to the islands of the South Pacific, ports of call in Southeast Asia, around the Cape of Good Hope and home to Gloucester without incident 18 months later seven times.\n\nUpon the urging of Bill Donovan, then head of the predecessor to the OSS, Johnson joined the U.S. Navy, and was at Pearl Harbor on the day of the attack. His intimate knowledge of the South Pacific made him a natural choice to advise the Pacific Fleet on the tides, swells, currents, depths and shoals around the treacherous reefs and atolls of the South Seas. He was commissioned a Lieutenant Commander, and joined the USS \"Sumner\", finishing the war as her commanding officer. On board they created and printed five-color charts, scouted out potential harbours for US Navy vessels, and conducted underwater demolition to improve the suitability of some of the harbours. Johnson also dove on recently sunken Japanese vessels, searching for classified Japanese documents. One success was a chart of the minefields surrounding Japanese harbors.\n\nMuch like his colleague Alan Villiers, Johnson educated the public about the majestic age of sail throughout his life, personally narrating showings of \"Around Cape Horn\" on board the \"Peking\", docked at South Street Seaport in New York City from 1974-2016 and working with Mystic Seaport and the Sea Education Association, serving as a trustee of both until his death in 1991.\n\nThe Los Angeles Maritime Institute has recently honored Irving and Exy by naming their twin brigantines for use in their award-winning Topsail Youth program after them.\n\nThe doyenne of modern sail training, Exy Johnson personally oversaw the christening ceremonies of the vessels whose construction she was instrumental in until her death in 2004.\n\nFormer crew members of their voyages include actor Sterling Hayden and Dr. Christopher B. Sheldon. Dr. Sheldon's experience on board the ill-fated brigantine \"Albatross\" served as the basis for the film \"White Squall\" (1996). Capt. Johnson also mentored yachtsman Jim Stoll, who became one of the directors of the Flint School.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous series. The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time.\n\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, the climate was warmer than present, although throughout the period a cooling trend is evident. The tropics became restricted to equatorial regions and northern latitudes experienced markedly more seasonal climatic conditions.\n\nDue to plate tectonics, the Americas were gradually moving westward, causing the Atlantic Ocean to expand. The Western Interior Seaway divided North America into eastern and western halves; Appalachia and Laramidia. India maintained a northward course towards Asia. In the Southern Hemisphere, Australia and Antarctica seem to have remained connected and began to drift away from Africa and South America. Europe was an island chain. Populating some of these islands were endemic dwarf dinosaur species.\n\nIn the Late Cretaceous, the hadrosaurs, ankylosaurs, and ceratopsians experienced success in Asiamerica (Western North America and eastern Asia). Tyrannosaurs dominated the large predator niche in North America. They were also present in Asia, although were usually smaller and more primitive than the North American varieties. Pachycephalosaurs were also present in both North America and Asia. Dromaeosaurs shared the same geographical distribution, and are well documented in both Mongolia and Western North America. Additionally therizinosaurs (known previously as segnosaurs) appear to have been in North America and Asia. Gondwana held a very different dinosaurian fauna, with most predators being abelisaurs and carcharodontosaurs; and titanosaurs being among the dominant herbivores.\nSpinosaurids were also present during this time. \nBirds became increasingly common and diverse, diversifying in a variety of enantiornithe and ornithurine forms. Early Neornithes such as \"Vegavis\" co-existed with forms as bizarre as \"Yungavolucris\" and \"Avisaurus\". Though mostly small, marine Hesperornithes became relatively large and flightless, adapted to life in the open sea.\n\nThough primarily represented by azhdarchids, other forms like pteranodontids, tapejarids (\"Caiuajara\" and \"Bakonydraco\"), nyctosaurids and uncertain forms (\"Piksi\", \"Navajodactylus\") are also present. Historically, it has been assumed that pterosaurs were in decline due to competition with birds, but it appears that neither group overlapped significantly ecologically, nor is it particularly evident that a true systematic decline was ever in place, especially with the discovery of smaller pterosaur species.\n\nSeveral old mammal groups began to disappear, with the last eutriconodonts occurring in the Campanian of North America. In the northern hemisphere, cimolodont, multituberculates, metatherians and eutherians were the dominant mammals, with the former two groups being the most common mammals in North America. In the southern hemisphere there was instead a more complex fauna of dryolestoids, gondwanatheres and other multituberculates and basal eutherians; monotremes were presumably present, as was the last of the haramiyidans, \"Avashishta\".\n\nMammals, though generally small, ranged into a variety of ecological niches, from carnivores (Deltatheroida), to mollusc-eater (Stagodontidae), to herbivores (multituberculates, \"Schowalteria\", Zhelestidae and Mesungulatidae) to highly atypical cursorial forms (Zalambdalestidae, Brandoniidae).\n\nTrue placentals only evolved at the very end of the epoch; the same can be said for true marsupials. Instead, nearly all known eutherian and metatherian fossils belong to other groups.\nIn the seas, mosasaurs suddenly appeared and underwent a spectacular evolutionary radiation. Modern sharks also appeared and giant-penguin-like polycotylid plesiosaurs (3 meters long) and huge long-necked elasmosaurs (13 meters long) also diversified. These predators fed on the numerous teleost fishes, which in turn evolved into new advanced and modern forms (Neoteleostei). Ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs, on the other hand, became extinct during the Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event.\n\nNear the end of the Cretaceous Period, flowering plants diversified. In temperate regions, familiar plants like magnolias, sassafras, roses, redwoods, and willows could be found in abundance.\n\nThe Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time, approximately (Ma). It is widely known as the \"K–T extinction event\" and is associated with a geological signature, usually a thin band dated to that time and found in various parts of the world, known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–T boundary). \"K\" is the traditional abbreviation for the Cretaceous Period derived from the German name \"Kreidezeit\", and \"T\" is the abbreviation for the Tertiary Period (a historical term for the period of time now covered by the Paleogene and Neogene periods). The event marks the end of the Mesozoic Era and the beginning of the Cenozoic Era. \"Tertiary\" being no longer recognized as a formal time or rock unit by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the K-T event is now called the Cretaceous—Paleogene (or K-Pg) extinction event by many researchers.\n\nNon-avian dinosaur fossils are only found below the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary and became extinct immediately before or during the event. A very small number of dinosaur fossils have been found above the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, but they have been explained as reworked fossils, that is, fossils that have been eroded from their original locations then preserved in later sedimentary layers. Mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs and many species of plants and invertebrates also became extinct. Mammalian and bird clades passed through the boundary with few extinctions, and evolutionary radiation from those Maastrichtian clades occurred well past the boundary. Rates of extinction and radiation varied across different clades of organisms.\n\nScientists have hypothesized that the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinctions were caused by one or more catastrophic events such as massive asteroid impacts or increased volcanic activity. Several impact craters and massive volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps have been dated to the approximate time of the extinction event. These geological events may have reduced sunlight and hindered photosynthesis, leading to a massive disruption in Earth's ecology. Other researchers believe the extinction was more gradual, resulting from slower changes in sea level or climate.\n"}

{"id": "8593995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8593995", "title": "National Museum of Natural History (Luxembourg)", "text": "National Museum of Natural History (Luxembourg)\n\nThe National Museum of Natural History (, ) is a natural history museum in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg. The museum is located in the Grund quarter on the eastern bank of the Alzette river, next to the Neumünster Abbey cultural centre.\n\nThe museum is composed of eight separate scientific sections, spanning the natural sciences: botany, ecology, geology and mineralogy, geophysics and astrophysics, palaeontology, vertebrate zoology, and invertebrate zoology.\n\nThe Society of the Natural Sciences was established in 1850, under the patronage of Prince Henry, the newly appointed Governor of Luxembourg representing Grand Duke William III. The society's primary aim was the promotion of the natural sciences and natural history to the general population. To achieve this, the government put at the society's disposal a section of the city Athenaeum, now the National Library. Opening its doors in 1854, this area hosted a number of cabinets displaying fossil specimens, spread across three rooms. After almost four decades of this arrangement, pressure for display area caused the museum to move into its own premises, at the Vauban Barracks in Pfaffenthal, in 1892. However, these were criticised for being unattractive to visitors, hence undermining the museum's attempts to promote natural history to the general public.\n\nIn 1922, the museum moved once again. The new site was the Old Gendarmerie, on the Fishmarket, in the historic heart of Luxembourg City, which the museum shared with the National Museum of History and Art. Purchased by the government, the building, along with a neighbouring house, were initially unsuitable for the housing of the museum, and the state embarked upon a renovation programme, during which time, the collections were closed to the general public, causing much public anger. The renovations had almost been completed by the outbreak of the Second World War, but the German occupation caused the museum to move again temporarily to protect its collections. Despite the war, the building in Fishmarket was virtually undamaged, allowing the museum to re-occupy the premises immediately. In 1946, a temporary installation was opened, marking the museum's return to its original purpose, thirty-four years after its closure. By 1952, the last room had been opened, marking a return to normal operation.\n\nIt was in the decades following the war that the museum diversified away from its core activities, engaging in fields such as geophysics and astrophysics; such was the museum's commitment to these fields that it was the owner of the first electron microscope in the country. However, the expansion of the museum into these additional fields put added pressure on the space of the museum in Fishmarket, particularly as the National Museum of History and Art was also expanding. After a decade-long search for a suitable new site, on 11 January 1990, the Chamber of Deputies agreed to restore Saint Jean's Hospice, in Grund.\n\nThe new site was opened in June 1996, spread across three buildings, each dedicated to a different aspect of the museum's functions: collection displays, teaching classrooms, and research laboratories.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21477", "title": "Neogene", "text": "Neogene\n\nThe Neogene () (informally Upper Tertiary or Late Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary. The term \"Neogene\" was coined in 1853 by the Austrian palaeontologist Moritz Hörnes (1815–1868).\n\nDuring this period, mammals and birds continued to evolve into roughly modern forms, while other groups of life remained relatively unchanged. Early hominids, the ancestors of humans, appeared in Africa near the end of the period. Some continental movement took place, the most significant event being the connection of North and South America at the Isthmus of Panama, late in the Pliocene. This cut off the warm ocean currents from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean, leaving only the Gulf Stream to transfer heat to the Arctic Ocean. The global climate cooled considerably over the course of the Neogene, culminating in a series of continental glaciations in the Quaternary Period that follows.\n\nIn ICS terminology, from upper (later, more recent) to lower (earlier):\n\nThe Pliocene Epoch is subdivided into 2 ages:\n\n\nThe Miocene Epoch is subdivided into 6 ages:\nIn different geophysical regions of the world, other regional names are also used for the same or overlapping ages and other timeline subdivisions.\n\nThe terms \"Neogene System\" (formal) and \"upper Tertiary System\" (informal) describe the rocks deposited during the \"Neogene Period\".\n\nThe continents in the Neogene were very close to their current positions. The Isthmus of Panama formed, connecting North and South America. The Indian subcontinent continued to collide with Asia, forming the Himalayas. Sea levels fell, creating land bridges between Africa and Eurasia and between Eurasia and North America.\n\nThe global climate became seasonal and continued an overall drying and cooling trend which began at the start of the Paleogene. The ice caps on both poles began to grow and thicken, and by the end of the period the first of a series of glaciations of the current Ice Age began.\n\nMarine and continental flora and fauna have a modern appearance. The reptile group Choristodera became extinct in the early part of the period, while the amphibians known as Allocaudata disappeared at the end. Mammals and birds continued to be the dominant terrestrial vertebrates, and took many forms as they adapted to various habitats. The first hominins, the ancestors of humans, may have appeared in southern Europe and migrated into Africa.\n\nIn response to the cooler, seasonal climate, tropical plant species gave way to deciduous ones and grasslands replaced many forests. Grasses therefore greatly diversified, and herbivorous mammals evolved alongside it, creating the many grazing animals of today such as horses, antelope, and bison. Eucalyptus fossil leaves occur in the Miocene of New Zealand, where the genus is not native today, but have been introduced from Australia.\n\nThe Neogene traditionally ended at the end of the Pliocene Epoch, just before the older definition of the beginning of the Quaternary Period; many time scales show this division.\n\nHowever, there was a movement amongst geologists (particularly marine geologists) to also include ongoing geological time (Quaternary) in the Neogene, while others (particularly terrestrial geologists) insist the Quaternary to be a separate period of distinctly different record. The somewhat confusing terminology and disagreement amongst geologists on where to draw what hierarchical boundaries is due to the comparatively fine divisibility of time units as time approaches the present, and due to geological preservation that causes the youngest sedimentary geological record to be preserved over a much larger area and to reflect many more environments than the older geological record. By dividing the Cenozoic Era into three (arguably two) periods (Paleogene, Neogene, Quaternary) instead of seven epochs, the periods are more closely comparable to the duration of periods in the Mesozoic and Paleozoic eras.\n\nThe International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) once proposed that the Quaternary be considered a sub-era (sub-erathem) of the Neogene, with a beginning date of 2.58 Ma, namely the start of the Gelasian Stage. In the 2004 proposal of the ICS, the Neogene would have consisted of the Miocene and Pliocene epochs. The International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) counterproposed that the Neogene and the Pliocene end at 2.58 Ma, that the Gelasian be transferred to the Pleistocene, and the Quaternary be recognized as the third period in the Cenozoic, citing key changes in Earth's climate, oceans, and biota that occurred 2.58 Ma and its correspondence to the Gauss-Matuyama magnetostratigraphic boundary. In 2006 ICS and INQUA reached a compromise that made Quaternary a subera, subdividing Cenozoic into the old classical Tertiary and Quaternary, a compromise that was rejected by International Union of Geological Sciences because it split both Neogene and Pliocene in two.\n\nFollowing formal discussions at the 2008 International Geological Congress in Oslo, Norway, the ICS decided in May 2009 to make the Quaternary the youngest period of the Cenozoic Era with its base at 2.58 Mya and including the Gelasian age, which was formerly considered part of the Neogene Period and Pliocene Epoch. Thus the Neogene Period ends bounding the succeeding Quaternary Period at 2.58 Mya.\n\n"}
{"id": "2236015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236015", "title": "North Pacific Current", "text": "North Pacific Current\n\nThe North Pacific Current (sometimes referred to as the North Pacific Drift) is a slow warm water current that flows west-to-east between 30 and 50 degrees north in the Pacific Ocean. The current forms the southern part of the North Pacific Subpolar Gyre and the northern part of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The North Pacific Current is formed by the collision of the Kuroshio Current, running northward off the coast of Japan, and the Oyashio Current, which is a cold subarctic current that flows south and circulates counterclockwise along the western North Pacific Ocean. In the eastern North Pacific off southern British Columbia, it splits into the southward flowing California Current and the northward flowing Alaska Current.\n\nOriginating from the eastward directed flow occurring east of the island of Honshu, Japan, the North Pacific Current extends over 40° of longitude. According to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, the NPC may be considered to be a part or an extension of the Kuroshio current. The current covers a large area and transports warmer water from the subtropics to the sub-polar latitudes. Average sea surface temperature along the NPC can range in the winter from 45-61°F (7.2-16.1°C) and in the summer months 64°F-74°F (17.8-23.3°C).\n\nAs it flows from west to east, the latitudinal extent of the NPC increases such that it spans some 20 degrees of latitude east of the dateline. This is associated with a decrease in the speed of current; eastward directed speeds at the surface are typically less than 0.05 m/s (5 cm/s) in the central Pacific. As the NPC approaches the west coast of North America, it divides into two broad currents: the northward flowing Alaska Current and the southward flowing California Current.This splitting of flow is referred to as the bifurcation of the NPC. \n\nThe Gulf of Alaska and the California Current receive different volumes and flows of warm water from the North Pacific Current. The Gulf of Alaska receives about 60% of the flow of the NPC while the California Current receives the remaining 40%. These values may fluctuate, resulting in changes in the volume and the speed of the NPC water entering into the Alaska and California Currents.\n\nThe NPC forms the northward portion of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. As the eastward extension of the Kuroshio, the westward flow of the NPC can lead to the transport of material from the western Pacific to the coast of North America. For example, some of the marine debris from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011 was transported by the NPC across the Pacific, leading to deposition of tsunami debris along the shores of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon.\n\n"}

OAR is also referred to as NOAA Research.\n\nNOAA Research is the research and development arm of NOAA and is the driving force behind NOAA environmental products and services aimed at protecting life and property and promoting sustainable economic growth. Research, conducted by programs within NOAA and through collaborations outside NOAA, focuses on enhancing the understanding of environmental phenomena such as tornadoes, hurricanes, climate variability, changes in the ozone layer, El Niño/La Niña events, fisheries productivity, ocean currents, deep sea thermal vents, and coastal ecosystem health. \n\nThe origins of NOAA Research date back more than 200 years with the creation of the Survey of the Coast in 1807 by Thomas Jefferson. The Coast Survey, which became the U.S. Lake Survey office in 1841, was developed to undertake \"a hydrographic survey of northwestern [Great] lakes.\" Research executed by the scientists of this group was innovative and holistic: the first current meters were developed to understand water flow rates, and forecasting techniques were greatly enhanced to predict water levels and the relationship to lakefront property. The same traits of world class, long-term research continue to define NOAA Research today.\n\nThe science and technology that NOAA Research produces is not only relevant to society, it anticipates and responds to partners’ needs to demonstrates the value of technologies so that partners can deploy them into their applications. OAR works with end-users to integrate mature technologies (and associated expertise) into larger systems, either in NOAA operations or partner applications, via testbeds, patents, etc.\n\nNOAA Research is an open research network consisting of seven federal research laboratories, six program offices, sixteen Cooperative Institutes (which are non-federal, non-profit research institutions in 5-10 year collaborative partnerships with NOAA), and 33 university based Sea Grant programs. OAR also relies on work performed at numerous public, private, and academic institutions. Through its laboratories, programs, and external partners, OAR seeks to balance the activities that benefit from the long-term, dedicated capabilities of federal facilities with those that require the diverse expertise of our university partners.\n\nThe components and programs of NOAA Research are:\n\nWorking under the broad themes of Climate, Atmosphere, and Oceans, NOAA scientists study the ocean's depths and the highest reaches of space. NOAA's long-term commitment to conducting preeminent research includes engaging in-house and external talent to: \nResearch plans and products are developed in partnership with academia and other federal agencies, and are peer-reviewed and widely distributed. A high premium is placed on external collaboration both domestically and internationally.\n\nNOAA Research has three primary research areas: Climate, Weather and Air Chemistry, and Oceans, Coasts & the Great Lakes.\n\nNOAA's research laboratories, the Climate Program Office, and research partners conduct research into complex climate systems and how they work. The aim of this research is to predict climate variation in the shorter term, for example, cold spells or periods of drought, and over longer terms, such as centuries and beyond.\n\nNOAA scientists are at the forefront of studying climate change and modeling what the effects will be on the Earth. Researchers at NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) have developed the Coupled Hydrosphere-Atmosphere Research Model (CHARM) to enable a valid assessment of the impact of how climate change might affect the climate and ecology of the Great Lakes. The CHARM model provides a realistic surface-atmosphere feedback portrayal, and accounts for runoff from land surfaces. It allows researchers to predict that global warming likely will bring higher temperatures and increased precipitation to the Great Lakes. Development of a second generation of CHARM is underway to help answer questions about greenhouse warming effects on Great Lakes water quantity.\n\nNOAA researchers closely monitor the Earth's atmosphere searching for clues about long-term changes in the global climate. The data collected worldwide by NOAA researchers contributes to the understanding of complex climatic systems and the ability to forecast changes.\n\nNOAA Research organizations conduct research on the upper and lower atmosphere as well as the space environment. Their findings form the basis for NOAA's contributions to major national and international environmental programs and agreements.\n\nFor instance, improvements in forecast and warning services provided by the National Weather Service are a direct result of NOAA research. Improvements in numerical modeling, observations gathered by satellites and Doppler weather radars (NEXRAD), and sophisticated weather warning and information processing and communications systems, have collectively led to significantly improved severe weather forecasts and warnings.\n\nOther research programs focus on observation and study of the chemical and physical processes of the atmosphere, detecting the effects of pollution on those processes and monitoring and forecasting the phenomena affecting the Sun-Earth environment.\n\nNOAA Research, in cooperation with its research partners, explores and investigates ocean habitats and resources. The findings of NOAA researchers contribute to the management of fisheries, conservation of coastlines, and development of a stronger economy through marine products and businesses, such as biotechnology and sustainable aquaculture.\n\nNOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) in Seattle, Washington, designed Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART-II) technology, which provides two-way communication capabilities, allowing engineers the ability to troubleshoot these systems from the lab and repair them remotely when possible. This capability minimizes system downtime, especially in the harsh winter conditions of the North Pacific, and reduces costs by not having to deploy a ship to make repairs.\n\nMost environmental questions are not easily answered.

The resulting encoded material is conceptually similar to the pattern of magnetic field orientations within the magnetic domains of a ferromagnet, and thus may be considered as a possible technology for computer storage media. The encoded regions are optically active (have a varying index of refraction) and thus may be \"read out\" optically.\n\nThe encoding process proceeds by application of ultraviolet light tuned to the absorption band associated with the transition of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. During UV application, an external electric field is used to modify the electric dipole moment of regions of the ferroelectric material that are exposed to UV light. By this process, a pattern of local electric field orientations can be encoded.\n\nTechnically, the encoding effect proceeds by the creation of a population inversion between the valence and conduction bands, with the resulting creation of plasmons. During this time, ferroelectric perovskite materials can be forced to change geometry by the application of an electric field. The encoded regions become optically active due to the Pockels effect.\n\nThe pattern of ferroelectric domain orientations can be read out optically. The refractive index of the ferroelectric material at wavelengths from near-infrared through to near-ultraviolet is affected by the electric field within the material. A changing pattern of electric field domains within a ferroelectric substrate results in different regions of the substrate having different refractive indices. Under these conditions, the substrate behaves as a diffraction grating, allowing the pattern of domains to be inferred from the interference pattern present in the transmitted readout beam.\n\n\n\n\n__notoc__\n"}

{"id": "97150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97150", "title": "Shofar", "text": "Shofar\n\nA shofar (pron. , from , ) is an ancient musical horn typically made of a ram's horn, used for Jewish religious purposes. Like the modern bugle, the shofar lacks pitch-altering devices, with all pitch control done by varying the player's embouchure. The shofar is blown in synagogue services on Rosh Hashanah and at the very end of Yom Kippur, and is also blown every weekday morning in the month of Elul running up to Rosh Hashanah. Shofars come in a variety of sizes and shapes, depending on the choice of animal and level of finish.\n\nThe shofar is mentioned frequently in the Hebrew Bible, the Talmud and rabbinic literature. In the first instance, in , the blast of a shofar emanating from the thick cloud on Mount Sinai makes the Israelites tremble in awe.\n\nThe shofar was used to announce the new moon and the Jubilee year. The first day of the seventh month (Tishrei) is termed \"a memorial of blowing\", or \"a day of blowing\", the shofar. They were used for signifying the start of a war. Later, they were also employed in processions as musical accompaniment, and eventually were inserted into the temple orchestra by David. Note that the \"trumpets\" described in Numbers 10 are a different instrument, described by the Hebrew word for 'trumpet' (), not ().\n\nThe Torah describes the first day of the seventh month (the first of Tishrei, or Rosh Hashanah) as a \"zikron teruˁah\" (; Lev. 23:24) and as a \"yom teruˁah\" (; Num. 29). This was interpreted by the Jewish sages as referring to the blowing of the shofar.\n\nIn the Temple in Jerusalem, the shofar was sometimes used together with the trumpet. On New Year's Day the principal ceremony was conducted with the shofar, which instrument was placed in the center with a trumpet on either side; it was the horn of a wild goat and straight in shape, being ornamented with gold at the mouthpiece. On fast days the principal ceremony was conducted with the trumpets in the center and with a shofar on either side. On those occasions the shofarot were rams' horns curved in shape and ornamented with silver at the mouthpieces. On Yom Kippur of the jubilee year the ceremony was performed with the shofar as on New Year's Day.\n\nOn Rosh Hashanah and other full holidays (Day of Atonement, Sukkot, Passover and the Feast of Weeks) a single priest perfected two sacrifices in honor of the full holiday. On Rosh Hashanah, something special occurred during the special sacrifice. Arguably two Shofar sounders played the long notes and one trumpet player played the short note. Accordingly, Rosh Hashanah is called Yom Teruah (the day of the blast). Otherwise, the trumpets had \"top billing\". Rosh Hashanah 27a, supports this claim: \"Said Raba or it may have been R. Joshua B. Levi: What is the scriptural warrant for this? – Because it is written, 'With trumpets and the sound of the Shofar shout ye before the King in the Temple, we require trumpets and the sound of the Shofar; elsewhere not.'\"\n\nIndeed, on Yom Kippur, the Shofar was sounded to announce the Jubilee Year (every 50 years, Jews were granted forgiveness, debts were forgiven, indentured Israelites were granted freedom, and the fields \"shall become owned by the priests\". Shofar first indicated in Yovel (Jubilee Year—Lev. 25:8–13). Indeed, in Rosh Hashanah 33b, the sages ask why the Shofar sounded in Jubilee year. Rosh Hashanah 29a indicates that in ordinary years both Shofars and trumpets are sounded, but in the Jubilee Year only the Shofar blasts. The Rabbi's created the practice of the Shofar's sounding every Yom Kippur rather than just on the Jubilee Year (once in 50 years).\n\nOtherwise, for all other special days, the Shofar is sounded shorter and two special silver Trumpets announced the sacrifice. When the trumpets sound the signal, all the people who were within the sacrifice prostrate themselves, stretching out flat, face down and on the ground.\n\nThe shofar was blown in the times of Joshua to help him capture Jericho. As they surrounded the walls, the shofar was blown and the Jews were able to capture the city. The shofar was commonly taken out to war so the troops would know when a battle would begin. The person who would blow the shofar would call out to the troops from atop a hill. All of the troops were able to hear the call of the shofar from their position because of its distinct sound.\n\nAt the inception of the diaspora, during the short-lived ban on playing musical instruments, the shofar was enhanced in its use, as a sign of mourning for the destruction of the temple. The declaration of the ban's source was in fact set to music itself as the lamentation \"Al Naharoth Bavel\" within a few centuries of the ban. (A full orchestra played in the temple. The ban was so that this would not be taken for granted, hence the wording of the ban, \"if I forget thee O Jerusalem, over my chiefest joy...\".) The shofar continues to announce the Jewish year, and the sighting of the new moon, to introduce Shabbat, to carry out the commandment to sound it on Rosh Hashanah, and to mark the end of the day of fasting on Yom Kippur, once the services have been completed in the evening. Secular uses have been discarded (see a notable exception in a section further down).\n\nThe shofar is primarily associated with Rosh Hashanah; indeed, Rosh Hashanah is called (or 'day of the shofar blast'). In the Mishnah (book of early rabbinic laws derived from the Torah), a discussion centers on the primacy of the shofar in the time before the destruction of the second temple (70 CE). Indeed, the shofar was the center of the ceremony, with two silver trumpets playing a lesser role. On other solemn holidays, fasts, and new moon celebrations, two silver trumpets were featured, with one shofar playing a lesser role. The shofar is also associated with the jubilee year in which, every fifty years, Jewish law provided for the release of all slaves, land, and debts. The sound of the shofar on Rosh Hashanah announced the jubilee year, and the sound of the shofar on Yom Kippur proclaimed the actual release of financial encumbrances.\n\nThe halakha (Jewish law) rules that the shofar may not be sounded on Shabbat, due to the potential that the (shofar sounder) may inadvertently carry it, which is in a class of forbidden Shabbat work. In ancient Israel, the shofar was sounded on Shabbat in the temple located in Jerusalem. After the temple's destruction, the sounding of the shofar on Shabbat was restricted to the place where the great Sanhedrin (Jewish legislature and court from 400 BCE to 100 CE) was located. However, when the Sanhedrin ceased to exist, the sounding of the shofar on Shabbat was discontinued.\n\nAccording to rabbinic literature, the shofar says, \"Awake, sleepers from your sleep, and slumberers arise from your slumber!\"\n\nThe Sages indicated that the mitzvah was to hear the sounds of the shofar. They went so far as to consider a shofar blown into a pit or cave and to decide whether a person who hears the original sound or the echo has fulfilled the mitzvah. Mishnah (Rosh Hashanah 27b). The Shulchan Aruch sums up that if the hearer hears the reverberation, the mitzvah is not valid. However, if the listener perceives the direct sounds, he fulfils the mitzvah. Thus, most modern halakhic authorities hold that hearing a shofar on the radio or the Internet would not be valid to satisfy the mitzvah because \"electronically reproduced sounds do not suffice for mitzvot that require hearing a specific natural sound... However, one should consult a competent rabbi if an unusually pressing situation arises, as some authorities believe that performing mitzvot through electronically reproduced sound is preferable to not performing them at all.\"\n\nAccording to Jewish law women and minors are exempt from the commandment of hearing the shofar blown (as is the case with any positive, time-bound commandment), but they are encouraged to attend the ceremony.\n\nIf the (shofar sounder) blows with the intention that all who hear will perform the mitzvah, then anyone listening—even someone passing by—who intends to hear the Shofar can perform the mitzvah because the community blower blows for everybody. If the listener stands still, it is presumed he intends to hear. If one hears the blast but with no intention of fulfilling the mitzvah, then the mitzvah has not been fulfilled.\n\nThe expert who blows (or \"blasts\" or \"sounds\") the shofar is termed the or (lit. \"master of the blast\"). Being a is an honor. Every male Jew is eligible for this sacred office, providing he is acceptable to the congregation. The one who blows the shofar on Rosh Hashanah should be learned in the Torah and shall be God-fearing.\n\nThe Shulchan Aruch discusses who is fit to blow the shofar on behalf of a congregation:\n\nAccording to the Talmud, a shofar may be made from the horn of any animal from the Bovidae family except that of a cow, although a ram is preferable. Bovidae horns are made of a layer of keratin (the same material as human toenails and fingernails) around a core of bone, with a layer of cartilage in between, which can be removed to leave the hollow keratin horn. An antler, on the other hand, is made of solid bone, so an antler cannot be used as a shofar because it cannot be hollowed out.\n\nThere is no requirement for ritual slaughter (shechita), and theoretically, the horn can come from a non-kosher animal because under most, but not all, interpretations of Jewish law the shofar is not required to be ('permissible in your mouth'); the mitzvah is hearing the shofar, not eating the animal it came from. The shofar falls into the category of – objects used to perform a mitzvah that do not themselves have inherent holiness. Moreover, because horn is always inedible, it is considered ('mere dust') and not an unkosher substance.\n\nThe Elef Hamagen (586:5) delineates the order of preference: 1) curved ram; 2) curved other sheep; 3) curved other animal; 4) straight—ram or otherwise; 5) non-kosher animal; 6) cow. The first four categories are used with a \"bracha\" (blessing), the fifth without a \"bracha\", and the last, not at all.\nIn practice two species are generally used: the Ashkenazi and Sefardi shofar is made from the horn of a domestic ram, while a Yemeni shofar is made from the horn of a kudu. A Moroccan shofar is flat, with a single, broad curve.\nA crack or hole in the shofar affecting the sound renders it unfit for ceremonial use. A shofar may not be painted in colors, but it may be carved with artistic designs (Shulkhan Arukh, Orach Chayim, 586, 17). Shofars (especially the Sephardi shofars) are sometimes plated with silver across part of their length for display purposes, although this invalidates them for use in religious practices.\n\nThe horn is flattened and shaped by the application of heat, which softens it. A hole is made from the tip of the horn to the natural hollow inside. It is played much like a European brass instrument, with the player blowing through the hole, causing the air column inside to vibrate. Sephardi shofars usually have a carved mouthpiece resembling that of a European trumpet or French horn, but smaller. Ashkenazi shofars do not.\n\nBecause the hollow of the shofar is irregular in shape, the harmonics obtained when playing the instrument can vary: rather than a pure perfect fifth, intervals as narrow as a fourth, or as wide as a sixth may be produced.\n\nThe \"tekiah\" () and \"teruah\" () sounds mentioned in the Tanakh were respectively bass and treble. The \"tekiah\" (or \"t'kiah\" or \"t'qiah\") was a plain, deep sound, ending abruptly; the \"teruah\" (or \"t'ruah\"), a trill between two tekiahs. These two sounds, constituting a single unit of shofar sounding, were rendered three times during a service added specially for Rosh HaShanah: first in honor of God's kingship (\"malchiyot\" or \"malchuyot\")); next to recall the Binding of Isaac, in order to cause the congregation to be remembered before God (zichronot); and a third time to comply with the precept regarding the shofar (shofrot).\n\nThe word \"teruah\" (a broken sound) appears three times in the Bible in the context of the shofar, from which the Talmud derives the rule that three such sounds must be made. In addition, other verses connect the word \"tekiah\" (an unbroken sound) to teruah twice, thus leading the Talmud to rule that each \"teruah\" must be preceded and followed by a \"tekiah\", leading to a total of nine blasts (\"tekiah-teruah-tekiah\" three times).\n\nOver time doubts arose as to the correct sound of the teruah. The Talmud is uncertain whether it means a moaning/groaning or a staccato beat sound. A system of three sounds was therefore devised to account for all the possibilities:\n\nThe doubt as to the nature of the Biblical teruah, whether it was simply a broken moan (shevarim), a staccato (teruah) or both (shevarim-teruah), necessitates three near-repetitions to make sure of securing the correct sound. The sequence of the shofar blowing is thus:\n\nThis series is also known by its acronyms: \"TaShRaT, TaShaT, TaRaT,\" respectively.\n\nWhen blowing the \"shevarim-teruah\", the \"tekiah\" is lengthened to be slightly longer than the duration of the \"shevarim\" and the \"teruah\" together.\n\nSome opinions require trebling the series, based on the mention of \"teruah\" three times in connection with the seventh month (Lev. xxiii, xxv; Num. xxix), and also on the above-mentioned division of the service into \"malchiyot\", \"zichronot\", and \"shofarot\".\n\nTo fulfill all of the opinions and criteria above, a total of thirty blasts are sounded, the minimum number required today:\n\nAlternatively, although fewer opinions are satisfied, some communities sound a single series of \"tashrat-tashat-tarat\" without trebling. This may also fulfill the required total of thirty blasts, if tekiah is counted as one note, shevarim three, and teruah nine.\n\nRegardless, all halachic authorities teach that one should follow one's community's custom.\n\nIt is customary to hear 100 or 101 sounds in the synagogue, although the minimum requirement is to hear 30 sounds.\n\nThe shofar is sounded just before, during and after the Musaf prayer on Rosh Hashanah. For the sounding just before Musaf, after the Torah reading, relevant verses from the Bible are recited, followed by two blessings: one on the Biblical commandment of \"hearing the sound of the shofar\" and the blessing of Shehecheyanu. After that, thirty shofar blasts are sounded. In the Musaf prayer itself, the shofar is sounded three times during the silent prayer, and then again three times during the leader's repetition. For each of these soundings, ten appropriate selections from the Bible are recited, followed by a benediction, followed finally by a series of ten shofar blasts. After leader's repetition of the Musaf prayer is completed, a final series of ten (or eleven, depending on the community's custom) shofar blasts are sounded, yielding a total of 100 or 101 blasts. (Some communities do not blow the shofar during the silent Musaf prayer, instead blowing the 30 blasts after the leader's repetition.) After the service is over, it is customary to blow another series of thirty blasts \"to confuse the Satan\".\nAccording to the Sephardic tradition, a full 101 blasts are sounded, corresponding to the 100 cries of the mother of Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army who did not return home after being killed by Yael (Judges 5:28). One cry is added to symbolize the legitimate love of a mother mourning her son.\n\nThe shofar is used mainly on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. It is blown in synagogues to mark the end of the fast at Yom Kippur, and blown at four particular occasions in the prayers on Rosh Hashanah. Because of its inherent ties to the Days of Repentance and the inspiration that comes along with hearing its piercing blasts, the shofar is also blown after morning services for the entire month of Elul, the last month of the Jewish civil year and the sixth of the Jewish ecclesiastical year. It is not blown on the last day of month, however, to mark the difference between the voluntary blasts of the month and the mandatory blasts of the holiday. Shofar blasts are also used during penitential rituals such as Yom Kippur Katan and optional prayer services called during times of communal distress. The exact modes of sounding can vary from location to location.\n\nIn an effort to improve the skills of shofar blowers, an International Day of Shofar Study is observed on Rosh Chodesh Elul, the start of the month preceding Rosh Hashanah.\nDuring the Ottoman and the British rule of Jerusalem, Jews were not allowed to sound the shofar at the Western Wall. After the Six-Day War, Rabbi Shlomo Goren famously approached the Wall and sounded the shofar. This fact inspired Naomi Shemer to add an additional line to her song \"Jerusalem of Gold\", saying, \"a shofar calls out from the Temple Mount in the Old City.\"\n\nIn pop music, the shofar is used by the Israeli Oriental metal band Salem in their adaptation of \"Al Taster\" (Psalm 27). The late trumpeter Lester Bowie played a shofar with the Art Ensemble of Chicago. In the film version of the musical \"Godspell\", the first act opens with cast member David Haskell blowing the shofar. In his performances, Israeli composer and singer Shlomo Gronich uses the shofar to produce a very wide range of notes. Since 1988 Rome-based American composer Alvin Curran's project \"Shofar\" features the shofar as a virtuoso solo instrument and in combination with sets of natural and electronic sounds. Madonna used a shofar played by Yitzhak Sinwani on the Confessions Tour and the album \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" for the song \"Isaac\", based on Im Nin'alu. In 2003, The Howard Stern Show featured a contest called \"Blow the Shofar\", which asked callers to correctly identify popular songs played on the shofar. The shofar is sometimes used in Western classical music. Edward Elgar's oratorio \"The Apostles\" includes the sound of a shofar, although other instruments, such as the flugelhorn, are usually used instead.\n\nThe shofar has been used in a number of films, both as a sound effect and as part of musical underscores. Elmer Bernstein incorporated the shofar into several cues for his score for Cecil B. DeMille's \"The Ten Commandments\"; one of the shofar calls recorded by Bernstein was later reused by the sound editors for \"Return of the Jedi\" for the Ewoks' horn calls. Jerry Goldsmith's scores to the films \"Alien\" and \"Planet of the Apes\" also incorporate the shofar in their orchestration.\n\nThe Shofar has been sounded as a sign of victory and celebration. Jewish elders were photographed blowing multiple shofars after hearing that the Nazis surrendered on May 8, 1945. The shofar has played a major role in the pro-Israel movement and often played in the Salute to Israel Parade and other pro-Israel demonstrations.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They can take in water, and will keep doing so until they are full, or until the rate at which they can transmit water into and through the pores is exceeded. Some of this water will steadily drain through the soil (via gravity) and end up in the waterways and streams, but much of it will be retained, despite the influence of gravity. Much of this retained water can be used by plants and other organisms, thus contributing to land productivity and soil health.\n\nPores (the spaces that exist between soil particles) provide for the passage and/or retention of gasses and moisture within the soil profile. The soil's ability to retain water is strongly related to particle size; water molecules hold more tightly to the fine particles of a clay soil than to coarser particles of a sandy soil, so clays generally retain more water. Conversely, sands provide easier passage or transmission of water through the profile. Clay type, organic content, and soil structure also influence soil water retention.\n\nThe maximum amount of water that a given soil can retain is called field capacity, whereas a soil so dry that plants cannot liberate the remaining moisture from the soil particles is said to be at wilting point. Available water is that which the plants can utilize from the soil within the range between field capacity and wilting point. Roughly speaking for agriculture (top layer soil), soil is 25% water, 25% air, 45% mineral, 5% other; water varies widely from about 1% to 90% due to several retention and drainage properties of a given soil.\n\nThe role of soil water retention is profound; its effects are far reaching and relationships are invariably complex. This section focuses on a few key roles and recognizes that it is beyond the scope of this discussion to encompass all roles that can be found in the literature.\n\nThe process by which soil absorbs water and water drains downwards is called percolation.\n\nSoil water retention is essential to life. It provides an ongoing supply of water to plants between periods of replenishment (infiltration), so as to allow their continued growth and survival. For example, over much of temperate Victoria, Australia, this effect is seasonal and even inter-annual; the retained soil water that has accumulated in preceding wet winters permits survival of most perennial plants over typically dry summers when monthly evaporation exceeds rainfall. Soils generally contain more nutrients, moisture, and humus.\n\nSoil moisture has an effect on the thermal properties of a soil profile, including conductance and heat capacity. The association of soil moisture and soil thermal properties has a significant effect on temperature-related biological triggers, including seed germination, flowering, and faunal activity. (more water causes soil to more slowly gain or lose temperature given equal heating; water has roughly double the Heat capacity of soil)\n\nRecent climate modelling by Timbal et al. (2002) suggests a strong linkage between soil moisture and the persistence and variability of surface temperature and precipitation; further, that soil moisture is a significant consideration for the accuracy of \"inter-annular\" predications regarding the Australian climate.\n\nThe role of soil in retaining water is significant in terms of the hydrological cycle; including the relative ability of soil to hold moisture and changes in soil moisture over time:\n\n\n\n"}

The oil has been used over centuries as a perfume, a traditional medicine, or in religious ceremonies across a wide territory from India to Europe.\n\nCatholic Church iconography uses spikenard to represent Saint Joseph. With this meaning, Pope Francis has included the spikenard in his coat of arms.\n\n\"Nardostachys jatamansi\" is a flowering plant of the valerian family that grows in the Himalayas of Nepal, China, and India. The plant grows to about 1 meter (3 ft) in height and has pink, bell-shaped flowers. It is found in the altitude of about . Rhizomes (underground stems) can be crushed and distilled into an intensely aromatic amber-colored essential oil with thick consistency. Nard oil is used as a perfume, an incense, and an herbal medicine.\n\nLavender (genus \"Lavandula\") was also known by the ancient Greeks as \"nardos\", nard, after the Sanskrit \"narada\" or \"nalada\".\n\nThe oil was known in ancient times and was part of the Ayurvedic herbal tradition of India. It was obtained as a luxury in ancient Egypt, the Near East. In Rome, it was the main ingredient of the perfume \"nardinum\" (O.L. \"náladam\"), derived from the Hebrew שבלת נֵרד (\"shebolet nerd\", head of nard bunch), which was part of the Ketoret used when referring to the consecrated incense described in the Hebrew Bible and Talmud. It is also referred to as the HaKetoret (the incense). \n\nIt was offered on the specialized incense altar when the Tabernacle was located in the First and Second Jerusalem Temples. The ketoret was an important component of the Temple service in Jerusalem. Nard is mentioned a number of times in the Tanakh, and as part of incense in reference to \"hilchot shabbat\" in Tractate Shabbat 78b as well as Maimonides Hilchot Shabbat 18:16. It is mentioned twice in the Song of Solomon (1:12 and 4:13).\n\nNard was used to perfume the body of Patroklos by Achilles in Book 18 of Homer's \"Iliad\". Pliny's \"Natural History\" lists twelve species of \"nard\", identifiable with varying assurance, including \"Lavandula stoechas\" and tuberous valerian as well as true nard (in modern terms \"Nardostachys jatamansi\").\n\nIt was a common flavouring in Ancient Roman foods and occurs frequently in the recipes of Apicius, though it tends to be used sparingly.\n\nSpikenard was used to season foods in Medieval European cuisine, especially as a part of the spice blend used to flavor hypocras, a sweetened and spiced wine drink. From the 17th century, it was one of the ingredients for a strong beer called stingo.\n\nThe ancient Greeks called the lavender herb \"nardus\", after the Syrian city of Naarda (possibly the modern town of Dohuk, Iraq). It was also commonly called \"nard\". The species originally grown was \"L. stoechas\".\n\nIn the hispanic iconographic tradition of the Catholic Church, the spikenard is used to represent Saint Joseph. The Vatican has said that the coat of arms of Pope Francis includes the spikenard in reference to Saint Joseph.\n\nNard (Italian \"nardo\") is also mentioned in of the \"Inferno\" book of Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy\", such as (in the translation of H.

It has a characteristic temperature dependence of\n\nwhere formula_2 is a parameter dependent on the model under consideration.\n\nThe Mott variable-range hopping describes low-temperature conduction in strongly disordered systems with localized charge-carrier states and has a characteristic temperature dependence of\n\nfor three-dimensional conductance (with formula_2 = 1/4), and is generalized to \"d\"-dimensions\n\nHopping conduction at low temperatures is of great interest because of the savings the semiconductor industry could achieve if they were able to replace single-crystal devices with glass layers.\n\nThe original Mott paper introduced a simplifying assumption that the hopping energy depends inversely on the cube of the hopping distance (in the three-dimensional case). Later it was shown that this assumption was unnecessary, and this proof is followed here. In the original paper, the hopping probability at a given temperature was seen to depend on two parameters, \"R\" the spatial separation of the sites, and \"W\", their energy separation. Apsley and Hughes noted that in a truly amorphous system, these variables are random and independent and so can be combined into a single parameter, the \"range\" formula_6 between two sites, which determines the probability of hopping between them.\n\nMott showed that the probability of hopping between two states of spatial separation formula_7 and energy separation \"W\" has the form:\nwhere α is the attenuation length for a hydrogen-like localised wave-function. This assumes that hopping to a state with a higher energy is the rate limiting process.\n\nWe now define formula_9, the \"range\" between two states, so formula_10. The states may be regarded as points in a four-dimensional random array (three spatial coordinates and one energy coordinate), with the \"distance\" between them given by the range formula_6.\n\nConduction is the result of many series of hops through this four-dimensional array and as short-range hops are favoured, it is the average nearest-neighbour \"distance\" between states which determines the overall conductivity. Thus the conductivity has the form\nwhere formula_13is the average nearest-neighbour range. The problem is therefore to calculate this quantity.\n\nThe first step is to obtain formula_14, the total number of states within a range formula_6 of some initial state at the Fermi level. For \"d\"-dimensions, and under particular assumptions this turns out to be\nwhere formula_17.\nThe particular assumptions are simply that formula_13 is well less than the band-width and comfortably bigger than the interatomic spacing.\n\nThen the probability that a state with range formula_6 is the nearest neighbour in the four-dimensional space (or in general the (\"d\"+1)-dimensional space) is\nthe nearest-neighbour distribution.\n\nFor the \"d\"-dimensional case then\n\nThis can be evaluated by making a simple substitution of formula_22 into the gamma function, formula_23\n\nAfter some algebra this gives\nand hence that\n\nWhen the density of states is not constant (odd power law N(E)), the Mott conductivity is also recovered, as shown in this article.\n\nThe Efros–Shklovskii (ES) variable-range hopping is a conduction model which accounts for the Coulomb gap, a small jump in the density of states near the Fermi level due to interactions between localized electrons. It was named after Alexei L. Efros and Boris Shklovskii who proposed it in 1975.\n\nThe consideration of the Coulomb gap changes the temperature dependence to\n\nfor all dimensions (i.e. formula_2 = 1/2).\n\n"}

The teams of the member nations of the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), baseball's world governing body, are ranked based on their tournament results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of WBSC-recognized international tournaments. Under the existing system, rankings are based on a team's performance over the last four years, with major international tournaments awarded a higher weighting compared to minor international and continental tournaments.\n\nIn January 2009, the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) first published a listing in rank order of its member associations to provide a basis for comparison of the relative strengths of these teams. Though primarily focused on the respective men's senior teams of member nations, the current ranks also include points awarded based on results at the IBAF 'AAA' (Under 18) Junior and 'AA' (Under 16) Youth Championships held during the tracking period. Beginning in 2015, the rankings also determine which twelve teams participate in the WBSC Premier12 tournament.\n\nThe initial women's baseball rankings were based upon results from past Women's Baseball World Cups. While the calculations of the women's rankings are similar to that of the men's, one main difference is that they are inclusive of the three most recent IBAF Women's Baseball World Cups whereas the men's rankings only include the last two. Points are weighted in favor of the more recent results.\n\nIn the wake of the International Olympic Committee's decision to cut baseball from the 2012 Olympics program, the IBAF pushed the growth of women's baseball as to include a women's component in its bid for a reinstatement of the sport in future Olympics. The effort to unify the sports resulted in the merger of the IBAF with the International Softball Federation in 2013 to create the WBSC. As a result, the WBSC is also responsible for ranking international men's and women's softball teams.\n\nUnder the current system used, points are awarded to member nations based purely on their final position in recognised international tournaments. This is opposed to other international sports ranking systems such as the ICC Test Championship for cricket, that is based on both individual matches and the results of series, or the FIFA World Rankings for football, that is based solely on individual matches.\n\nPoints are awarded according to the following table:\n\"\" - If more than 32 teams compete, points are only awarded to the first 32 teams. (i.e. the spread is from 5th - 31st, Last gets 1 point.)\nThe points awarded after 4th place are spread evenly in an attempt to ensure balance between tournaments with different-sized fields: finishing 6th out of 20 teams is considered to be a higher accomplishment than finishing 6th out of 8 teams. Given that points are not fixed beyond 4th place, a calculation is used to determine how many points are awarded to each position. The calculation gives the difference between any two consecutive positions from 4th through to last (e.g. 4th and 5th, 7th and 8th, 21st and 22nd, etc.). The calculation is:\n\nThis is illustrated in the following table:\n\nA multiplier is used in awarding points, based on the prestige of the tournament and the quality of the teams involved. The table below reflects the changes in the international baseball schedule recently approved by the WBSC. Below are the multipliers that will be used beginning in 2012.\n\nWorld Baseball Classic 6x (Winner receives 50 points, multiplied by 6 for a total of 300 points)\n\nPremier 12 6x\n\nWBC Qualifiers * (Pool winner receives 50 points, 2nd – 40 pts, 3rd – 30 pts, 4th – 15 pts)\n\n21U and 18U 2x\n\n15U and 12U 1x\n\nContinental Championships, Continental Qualifiers, and all other WBSC-sponsored events will receive a multiplier based on the number of top-10 teams from the previous year-end rankings that are entered in the tournament. (See below)\n\n1.00× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where 3 or more competing teams are in the previous year-end top 10\n\n0.75× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where 2 competing teams are in the previous year-end top 10\n\n0.50× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where 1 competing team is in the previous year-end top 10\n\n0.25× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where no competing teams are in the previous year-end top 10\n\nAfter each tournament where ranking points are awarded, the WBSC re-releases the ranking list with the points from the most recent tournament added, and points from tournaments more than four years old removed.\n\n"}

In 1786 he graduated from the Navy Cadet Corps and took part in the Russo-Swedish War (1788-1790). During 1790-1793 he served in the Baltic Fleet. During 1793-1799 he sailed British ships all over the globe. Between 1793 and 1795 he served as a volunteer aboard the 36-gun HMS \"Oiseau\", under her captain, Robert Murray. Lisyansky recalled in his memoirs his experiences on the North American Station operating against French convoys and privateers, and how while in the West Indies he was struck by yellow fever, recalling how Murray had helped his recovery, even giving up part of his own accommodation for the sick Lisyansky.\n\nIn 1803-1806 Lisyanski as the commanding officer of the Russian-American Company's merchant sloop \"Neva\" took part in the first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth. The expedition was under the command of Count Nikolay Petrovich Rezanov, Plentipotentiary of Alexander I for the Far Eastern and Western colonies of the Russian Empire, and Captain Adam Johann von Krusenstern in \"Nadezhda\". They started from Kronstadt, but the ships split after visiting Hawaii, and Count Nikolay Rezanov and Lisianski headed to Russian America (Alaska). In 1804 \"Neva\" visited Easter Island, and later that year, was essential in defeating the Tlingit in the Battle of Sitka, Alaska. In 1805 he met Krusenstern again in Macau, but they soon separated. Also in 1805, he was the first to describe the Hawaiian monk seal on the island which now bears his name. Eventually, \"Neva\" was the first to return to Kronstadt on 22 July 1806. For his feats Lisyanski received several rewards, including the Order of Saint Vladimir of 3rd degree.\nLisyanski was buried at Tikhvin Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, St. Petersburg.\n\nA number of places are named after him: Lisianski Island in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a peninsula of Baranof Island, Alaska, a bay, a strait, a river, and a cape in North America, an undersea mountain in Okhotsk Sea, and a peninsula by the Okhotsk Sea. There is monument and Memorial museum of U.Lisyansky in ukrainian town of Nizhyn.\n\n"}
