{"id": "13683986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13683986", "title": "Alberta Royalty Review", "text": "Alberta Royalty Review\n\nThe 2007 Alberta Royalty Review was an independent panel, chaired by William M. Hunter, established by the government of Alberta to review the level of resource royalties collected by the provincial government from petroleum and natural gas companies. In their final report entitled \"Our Fair Share\" released on September 18, 2007 the panel concluded that Albertans, who own their natural resources, were not receiving their \"fair share\" from energy development. Royalty rates and formulas had \"not kept pace with changes in the resource base and world energy markets.\" As a result of the review new regulations came into effect under the Alberta Mines and Minerals Act including the Petroleum Royalty Regulation, 2009, and the Natural Gas Royalty Regulation, 2009. The government of Alberta expected to collect approximately $2 billion annually with new royalty formulas implemented in 2009. Instead of an increase in royalties on oil and gas, Alberta collected $13.5 billion less from 2009 to 2014 with the new formula. There was a flaw in the 2009 New Well Royalty Rate formula which was in effect by May 1, 2011, regarding the royalties on gas which had provided almost 67% of total royalties collected by Alberta prior to 2009. Under the 2009 formula applied to Natural Gas and By-products represented a decrease from the previous fixed rates. With this formula gas royalties declined by approximately $5 billion per year and provided only 17% of total royalties. In 2008 the global price of oil plummeted from an all-time high of $145 a barrel on July 8, 2008 to $32 a barrel later in 2008 resulting in \"the cancellation of many energy projects\" in Alberta. By 2015 several of these oil projects had not resumed. In spite of this, Alberta collected $2 billion in oil sands royalties in the post-2009 period with the new rate of 20% compared to $1.5 billion from 2004-2009 with the old rate of 15%. \n\nIn areas surveyed and homesteaded early in Alberta's history all sub-soil resource rights belong to the land owner, but in the areas surveyed later or in the massive crown land areas of the northern half of the province where the current productive oil fields are located, the Crown, represented by the provincial government, owns all sub-soil resources.\n\nUnlike many other oil-producing jurisdictions such as Saudi Arabia or Norway, Alberta does not have a government oil company that owns and exploits all petroleum resources. Instead privately owned oil companies of various sizes, from inside and outside Canada are encouraged to drill for oil and gas or mine oilsands on Crown land, and in exchange pay a royalty.\n\nIn 1930, the Natural Resources Transfer Act, shifted control of natural resources in Alberta from the federal government to the provincial government.\n\nIn 1931 the Alberta government set the royalty rate at five per cent on oil and gas, creating a rift with the oil industry.\n\nIn 1971, soon after winning a majority government for the Progressive Conservatives in 1971, then-premier Peter Lougheed moved to increase Alberta's share of royalties creating hostilities with the oil industry. At that time the price of oil was rising globally as the influence of the newly formed Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased.\n\nIn 1986 when the price of oil bottomed at US$10 a barrel, Don Getty, who was premier from 1985 to 1992, responded by providing the oil industry with $250 million in incentives and royalty cuts. By the end of 1986 Alberta had granted another nine-month cut from 12% to 1% in royalties at the Suncor oilsands. \n\nRalph Klein lowered royalties during the early 1990s to spur investment in the oil sands that faced an uncertain future with the low price of oil at that time. In 1997 the Alberta government set a \"generic royalty formula for oil sands projects\" using the \"1% and 25% formula.\" In 2001 the oil and gas industry represented 23 percent of Alberta's GDP.\n\nIn 2006, a year before becoming Premier of Alberta, Ed Stelmach announced his commitment to reviewing royalty rates for the oil sands as well as for conventional oil and natural gas. As Premier in 2007 he tasked then-Minister of Finance Lyle Oberg to lead the Alberta Royalty Review process. By 2007 The oil and gas industry represented 19 percent of the province's GDP.\n\nIn 2006-7 the oil sands royalty revenue was $2.411 billion. In 2007/08 it rose to $2.913 billion and it continued to rise in 2008/09 to $2.973 billion. Following the revised Alberta Royalty Regime it fell in 2009/10 to $1.008 billion. In that year Alberta's total resource revenue \"fell below $7 billion...when the world economy was in the grip of recession.\"\n\nIn February 2012 the Province of Alberta \"expected $13.4 billion in revenue from non-renewable resources in 2013-14. By January 2013 the province was anticipating only $7.4 billion. \"30 per cent of Alberta’s approximately $40-billion budget is funded through oil and gas revenues. Bitumen royalties represent about half of that total.\" In 2009/10 royalties from the oil sands amounted to $1.008 billion (Budget 2009 cited in Energy Alberta 2009.\n\nIn order to accelerate development of the oil sands, the federal and provincial governments more closely aligned taxation of the oil sands with other surface mining resulting in \"charging one per cent of a project’s gross revenues until the project’s investment costs are paid in full at which point rates increased to 25 per cent of net revenue. These policy changes and higher oil prices after 2003 had the desired effect of accelerating the development of the oil sands industry. \"A revised Alberta Royalty Regime was implemented in January 1, 2009 through which each oil sands project pays a gross revenue royalty rate of 1%.\n\nThe Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes described how royalty payments were calculated:\n\nWhen the price of oil per barrel is less than or equal to $55/bbl indexed against West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes 2011:30)(Indexed to the Canadian dollar price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to a maximum of 9%). When the price of oil per barrel is less than or equal to $120/ bbl indexed against West Texas Intermediate (WTI) \"payout.\"\n\nPayout refers \"the first time when the developer has recovered all the allowed costs of the project, including a return allowance on those costs equal to the Government of Canada long-term bond rate [\"LTBR\"].\n\nIn order to encourage growth and prosperity and due to the extremely high cost of exploration, research and development, oil sands and mining operations pay no corporate, federal, provincial taxes or government royalties other than personal income taxes as companies often remain in a loss position for tax and royalty purposes for many years. Defining a loss position becomes increasingly complex when vertically-integrated multi-national energy companies are involved. Suncor claims their realized losses were legitimate and that Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is unfairly claiming \"$1.2-billion\" in taxes which is jeopardizing their operations.\n\n\"Bitumen Valuation Methodology (BVM) is a method to determine for royalty purposes a value for bitumen produced in oil sands projects and either upgraded on-site or sold or transferred to affiliates. The BVM ensures that Alberta receives market value for its bitumen production, taken in cash or bitumen royalty-in-kind, through the royalty formula. Western Canadian Select (WCS), a grade or blend of Alberta bitumens, diluents (a product such as naphtha or condensate which is added to increase the ability of the oil to flow through a pipeline) and conventional heavy oils, developed by Alberta producers and stored and valued at Hardisty, AB was determined to be the best reference crude price in the development of a BVM.\"\n\nBy the end of 2001 the price of oil was as low as $20 a barrel. By July 8, 2008 the price of oil steadily increased until it reached an all-time high of $145 a barrel. Later in 2008 the price of oil plummeted to $32 a barrel resulting in \"the cancellation of many energy projects\" in Alberta. By 2015 several of these oil projects had not resumed.\n\nIn 2009/2010 the Alberta government collected $6.1 billion in royalties representing a drop of $3 billion.\n\nAccording to a 2015 University of Alberta's Parkland Institute report by Jim Roy, who was a Senior Advisor for Royalty Policy for Alberta Energy from 1985 to 1993, from 2010 to 2015 Alberta collected $13.5 billion less in royalty than in the previous five years. Instead of getting the expected $2 billion per year increase, Alberta saw a $3 billion per year decrease. The decrease was composed of a $5 billion per year decrease in gas royalty partially offset by increases in oil royalty and oil sands royalty. The total value of hydrocarbon production was about the same during each five-year period.\n\nFrom October 2009 to 2013/14 bitumen and crude oil royalties \"averaged $6.2 billion and contributed just under 16 per cent to government revenues on an annual basis.\" The Alberta government predicted in its 2014/15 fiscal-year budget that there would be \"an annual average of $8.0 billion in bitumen and crude oil royalties over the next three fiscal years (2014/15 to 2016/17) and an increase in the annual share of bitumen and crude oil royalties to over 17 per cent of government revenues.\"\n\nIn 2012-2013 $3.56 billion in royalties were collected from the oil sands.\n\nRoyalty rates on oil in Alberta are based on the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark in oil pricing in North America and the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. Western Canadian Select is the benchmark crude for Albertan oil.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Alberta Finance Minister in September 2007, the Chairman of the 2007 Alberta Royalty Review Bill Hunter, claimed \"Albertans do not receive their fair share from energy development and they have not, in fact, been receiving their fair share for some time.\"\n\nThe panel's report not only recommended increased royal rates for all three major resources (conventional oil, natural gas, and oilsands) but also insisted that the government had failed to collect royalties already owed.\n\nThe recommended rate increase amounted to a 20% increase or an extra $2 billion per year.\n\nSome supporters of the oil industry responded to the 2007 Review with concerns that Calgary would become the \"Caracas on the Bow\" in the province of \"Albertastan.\"\n\nIn 2007 the political response was highly polarized, with the parties of the left, the Alberta Liberals and Alberta New Democrats, criticizing the government for failing to get Alberta's \"fair share\" and, in effect, subsidizing oil companies at the expense of the public purse. They failed to make any gains against the Conservatives during the Alberta provincial general election of 2008, however, despite a record low turnout caused primarily by traditional Tory supporters staying home.\n\nThe highly respected global energy consultancy, Wood Mackenzie, released a study in September 2007, in which they ranked Alberta's 2007 fiscal regime for oil sands as 11th most favourable out of 100 jurisdictions globally. If all of the recommendations of the report [were] implemented, the report indicated \"that the oil sand terms would still rank 44 out of 100 countries in terms of attractiveness.\" In 2007 the proposed 64% government take remained well below the average government take of 74% calculated by Wood Mackenzie for the other countries in the study (this take included government equity participations in many countries). The Wood Mackenzie study confirms the findings of the Panel in this regard.\"\n\nIn September 2007, TD Bank Financial Group Chief economist, Don Drummond and Derek Burelton claimed Alberta's economy would continue to thrive. The TD report expected Alberta's response to the ARR to be \"the next major event,\" TD economists suggested that many of the review Panel's recommendations made economic sense. TD Economics had designated the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor as Canada's western economic tiger in 2003. From 1993 to 2003, Calgary-Edmonton Corridor \"registered explosive real economic growth and population increases, surpassing rates chalked up in the majority of North American urban centres.\" By 2003 oil and gas royalty revenues were surging and the Corridor was \"the only urban region in Canada to rival U.S. metropolitan areas in terms of both productivity and standard of living.\"\n\nThe Conservatives partially implemented the panel's recommendations. This coincided with a fall in oil prices during 2008 economic crisis. Oil and gas companies, especially juniors, complained that this hurt their bottom line, and threatened to move out of the province or shut down. In 2008 the global price of oil plummeted from $145 a barrel to $32 a barrel and many energy projects left the province or were shut down in Alberta. Some never resumed. Alberta collected $2 billion in oil sands royalties in the post-2009 period with the new rate of 20%.\n\nThe Alberta government announced on March 11, 2010 that royalty rates effective in January 2011, would be rolled back cutting the maximum rate for conventional oil from 50% to 40% of revenues and cutting the maximum rate for natural gas from 50% to 36%. The large decrease in royalty starting in 2009 was mostly due to the way the gas formula automatically adjusted to the falling price for natural gas. The government introduced a \"new well\" incentive that capped royalty to a maximum of 5% during the first year of production. However, this incentive had no actual effect on gas royalty because the price-sensitive formula has set a negative royalty rate each month since being introduced. For almost all wells, the royalty formula defaults to the minimum royalty rate of 5%. Those on the right criticized the government for raising royalties and damaging profits in Alberta's most important industry, which they likened the \"killing The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs\". Junior oil companies were instrumental in funding the upstart Wildrose Party which emerged in the Alberta provincial general election of 2012 as the major challenger to the governing Tories, and became the Official Opposition.\n\nThe repercussion for royalties was that in 2009/2010, the Alberta government collected 6.1 billion dollars in royalties for the oil and gas sector. This was a drop of $3 billion. Over the next five years, Alberta collected $13.5 billion less in royalty than in the previous five years. Instead of getting the expected $2 billion per year increase, Alberta saw a $3 billion per year decrease. The decrease was composed of a $5 billion per year decrease in gas royalty partially offset by increases in oil royalty and oil sands royalty. The total value of hydrocarbon production was about the same during each five-year period.\n\n"}
{"id": "46789513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46789513", "title": "Applegate mechanism", "text": "Applegate mechanism\n\nThe Applegate mechanism (Applegate's mechanism or Applegate effect) explains long term orbital period variations seen in certain eclipsing binaries. As a main sequence star goes through an activity cycle, the outer layers of the star are subject to a magnetic torque changing the distribution of angular momentum, resulting in a change in the star's oblateness. The orbit of the stars in the binary pair is gravitationally coupled to their shape changes, so that the period shows modulations (typically on the order of ∆P/P ∼ 10) on the same time scale as the activity cycles (typically on the order of decades).\n\nCareful timing of eclipsing binaries has shown that systems showing orbital period modulations on the order of ∆P/P ∼ 10 over a period of decades are quite common. A striking example of such a system is Algol, for which the detailed observational record extends back over two centuries. Over this span of time, a graph of the time dependence of the difference between the observed times of eclipses \"versus\" the predicted times shows a feature (termed the \"great inequality\") with a full amplitude of 0.3 days and a recurrent time scale of centuries. Superimposed on this feature is a secondary modulation with a full amplitude of 0.06 days and a recurrent time scale of about 30 years. Orbital period modulations of similar amplitude are seen in other Algol binaries as well.\n\nAlthough recurrent, these period modulations do not follow a strictly regular cycle. Irregular recurrence rules out attempts to explain these period modulations as being due to apsidal precession or the presence of distant, unseen companions. Apsidal precession explanations also have the problem that they require an eccentric orbit, but the systems in which these modulations are observed often show orbits of little eccentricity. Furthermore, third body explanations have the issue that in many cases, a third body massive enough to produce the observed modulation should not have managed to escape optical detection, unless the third body were quite exotic.\n\nAnother phenomenon observed in certain Algol binaries has been monotonic period increases. This is quite distinct from the far more common observations of alternating period increases and decreases explained by the Applegate mechanism. Monotonic period increases have been attributed to mass transfer, usually (but not always) from the less massive to the more massive star\n\nThe time scale and recurrence patterns of these orbital period modulations suggested to Matese and Whitmire (1983) a mechanism invoking changes in the quadrupole moment of one star with subsequent spin-orbit coupling. However, they could not provide any convincing explanation for what might cause such fluctuations in the quadrupole moment.\n\nTaking the Matese and Whitmire mechanism as a basis, Applegate argued that changes in the radius of gyration of one star could be related to magnetic activity cycles. Supportive evidence for his hypothesis came from the observation that a large fraction of the late-type secondary stars of Algol binaries appear to be rapidly rotating convective stars, implying that they should be chromospherically active. Indeed, orbital period modulations are seen only in Algol-type binaries containing a late-type convective star.\n\nGiven that gravitational quadrupole coupling is involved in producing orbital period changes, the question remained of how a magnetic field could induce such shape changes. Most models of the 1980s assumed that the magnetic field would deform the star by distorting it away from hydrostatic equilibrium. Marsh and Pringle (1990) demonstrated, however, that the energy required to produce such deformations would exceed the total energy output of the star.\n\nA star does not rotate as a solid body. The outer parts of a star contribute most to a star's quadrupole moment. Applegate proposed that as a star goes through its activity cycle, magnetic torques could cause a redistribution of angular momentum within a star. As a result, the rotational oblateness of the star will change, and this change would ultimately result in changing the orbital period via the Matese and Whitmire mechanism. Energy budget calculations indicate that the active star typically should be variable at the ΔL/L ≈ 0.1 level and should be differentially rotating at the ΔΩ/Ω ≈ 0.01 level.\n\nThe Applegate mechanism makes several testable predictions:\n\nTests of the above predictions have been supportive of the mechanism's validity, but not unambiguously so.\n\nThe Applegate effect provides a unified explanation for many (but not all) ephemeris curves for a wide class of binaries, and it may aid in the understanding of the dynamo activity seen in rapidly rotating stars.\n\nThe Applegate mechanism has also been invoked to explain variations in the observed transit times of extrasolar planets, in addition to other possible effects such as tidal dissipation and the presence of other planetary bodies.\n\nHowever, there are many stars for which the Applegate mechanism is inadequate. For example, the orbital period variations in certain eclipsing post-common-envelope binaries are an order of magnitude larger than can be accommodated by the Applegate effect, with magnetic braking or a third body in a highly elliptical orbit providing the only known mechanisms able to explain the observed variation.\n"}

{"id": "18453514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18453514", "title": "Atlantic history", "text": "Atlantic history\n\nAtlantic history is a specialty field in history that studies of the Atlantic World in the early modern period. The Atlantic World was created by the discovery of a new land by Europeans, and Atlantic History is the study of that world. It is premised on the idea that, following the rise of sustained European contact with the New World in the 16th century, the continents that bordered the Atlantic Ocean—the Americas, Europe, and Africa—constituted a regional system or common sphere of economic and cultural exchange that can be studied as a totality.. \n\nIts theme is the complex interaction between Europe (especially Britain, France, and the Iberian Peninsula) and the New World colonies. It encompasses a wide range of demographic, social, economic, political, legal, military, intellectual and religious topics treated in comparative fashion by looking at both sides of the Atlantic. Religious revivals characterized Britain and Germany, as well as the First Great Awakening in the American colonies. Migration and race/slavery have been important topics.\n\nPractitioners of Atlantic history typically focus on the interconnections and exchanges between these regions and the civilizations they harbored. In particular, they argue that the boundaries between nation states which traditionally determined the limits of older historiography should not be applied to such transnational phenomena as slavery, colonialism, missionary activity and economic expansion. Environmental history and the study of historical demography also play an important role, as many key questions in the field revolve around the ecological and epidemiological impact of the Columbian Exchange.\n\nRobert R. Palmer, an American historian of the French Revolution, pioneered the concept in the 1950s with a wide-ranging comparative history of how numerous nations experienced what he called \"The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800\" (1959 and 1964). Since the 1980s Atlantic history has emerged as an increasingly popular alternative to the older discipline of imperial history, although it could be argued that the field is simply a refinement and reorientation of traditional historiography dealing with the interaction between early modern Europeans and native peoples in the Atlantic sphere. The organization of Atlantic History as a recognized area of historiography began in the 1980s under the impetus of American historians Bernard Bailyn of Harvard University and Jack P. Greene of Johns Hopkins University, among others. The post-World War II integration of the European Union and the continuing importance of NATO played an indirect role in stimulating interest throughout the 1990s.\n\nBernard Bailyn's Seminar on the History of the Atlantic World promoted social and demographic studies, and especially regarding demographic flows of population into colonial America. As a leading advocate of the history of the Atlantic world, Bailyn has organized an annual international seminar at Harvard designed to promote scholarship in this field. Bailyn's \"Atlantic History: Concepts and Contours\" (2005) explores the borders and contents of the emerging field, which emphasizes cosmopolitan and multicultural elements that have tended to be neglected or considered in isolation by traditional historiography dealing with the Americas. Bailyn's reflections stem in part from his seminar at Harvard since the mid-1980s.\n\nOther important scholars are Jack Greene directed a program at Johns Hopkins in Atlantic History from 1972 to 1992 that has now expanded to global concerns. Karen Ordahl Kupperman established the Atlantic Workshop at New York University in 1997.\n\nOther scholars in the field include Ida Altman, Kenneth J. Andrien, David Armitage, Trevor Burnard, Jorge Canizares-Esguerra, Nicholas Canny, Philip D. Curtin, Laurent Dubois, J.H. Elliott, David Eltis, Alison Games, Eliga H. Gould, Anthony Grafton, Joseph C. Miller, Philip D. Morgan, Anthony Pagden, Jennifer L. Anderson, John Thornton, James D. Tracy, Carla G. Pestana, Isaac Land, Richard S. Dunn, and Ned C. Landsman.\n\nAlison Games (2006) explores the convergence of the multiple strands of scholarly interest that have generated the new field of Atlantic history, which takes as its geographic unit of analysis the Atlantic Ocean and the four continents that surround it. She argues Atlantic history is best approached as a slice of world history. The Atlantic, moreover, is a region that has logic as a unit of historical analysis only within a limited chronology. An Atlantic perspective can help historians understand changes within the region that a more limited geographic framework might obscure. Attempts to write a Braudelian Atlantic history, one that includes and connects the entire region, remain elusive, driven in part by methodological impediments, by the real disjunction that characterized the Atlantic's historical and geographic components, by the disciplinary divisions that discourage historians from speaking to and writing for each other, and by the challenge of finding a vantage point that is not rooted in any single place.\n\nOne impetus for Atlantic studies began in the 1960s with the historians of slavery who started tracking the flows of slaves from Africa to the New World. A second source came from historians of colonial America. Many were trained in early modern European history and were familiar with the historiography regarding England and the British Empire., which had been introduced a century before by George Louis Beer and Charles McLean Andrews. Colonialists have long been open to interdisciplinary perspectives, such as comparative approaches. In addition there was a frustration involved in writing about very few people in a small remote colony. Atlantic history opens the horizon to large forces at work over great distances.\n\nSome critics have complained that Atlantic history is little more than imperial history under another name. Is it perhaps too expansive in claiming to subsume both of the American continents, Africa and Europe, without seriously engaging with them?\n\nCanadian scholar Ian K. Steele (2009) argues that Atlantic history will tend to draw students beyond their national myths, while offering historical support for such 21st century policies as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Organization of American States, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), the New Europe, Christendom, and even the United Nations. He concludes, \"The early modern Atlantic can even be read as a natural antechamber for American‐led globalization of capitalism and serve as an historical challenge to the coalescing New Europe. No wonder that the academic reception of the new Atlantic history has been enthusiastic in the United States, and less so in Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, where histories of national Atlantic empires continue to thrive.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3697368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3697368", "title": "Coffee ring effect", "text": "Coffee ring effect\n\nIn physics, a \"coffee ring\" is a pattern left by a puddle of particle-laden liquid after it evaporates. The phenomenon is named for the characteristic ring-like deposit along the perimeter of a spill of coffee. It is also commonly seen after spilling red wine. The mechanism behind the formation of these and similar rings is known as the coffee ring effect or in some instances, the coffee stain effect, or simply ring stain.\n\nThe coffee-ring pattern originates from the capillary flow induced by the differential evaporation rates across the drop: liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting edgeward flow can carry nearly all the dispersed material to the edge. As a function of time, this process exhibit a \"rush-hour\" effect, that is, a rapid acceleration of the edgeward flow at the final stage of the drying process.\n\nEvaporation induces a Marangoni flow inside a droplet. The flow, if strong, redistributes particles back to the center of the droplet. Thus, for particles to accumulate at the edges, the liquid must have a weak Marangoni flow, or something must occur to disrupt the flow. For example, surfactants can be added to reduce the liquid's surface tension gradient, disrupting the induced flow. Water has a weak Marangoni flow to begin with, which is then reduced significantly by natural surfactants.\n\nInteraction of the particles suspended in a droplet with the free surface of the droplet is important in creating a coffee ring. \"When the drop evaporates, the free surface collapses and traps the suspended particles .. eventually all the particles are captured by the free surface and stay there for the rest of their trip towards the edge of the drop.\" This result means that surfactants can be used to manipulate the motion of the solute particles by changing the surface tension of the drop, rather than trying to control the bulk flow inside the drop.\n\nThe coffee-ring pattern is detrimental when uniform application of a dried deposit is required, such as in printed electronics. It can be suppressed by adding elongated particles, such as cellulose fibers, to the spherical particles that cause the coffee-ring effect. The size and weight fraction of added particles may be smaller than those of the primary ones.\n\nIt is also reported that controlling flow inside a droplet is a powerful way to generate uniform film; for example, by harnessing solutal Marangoni flows occurring during evaporation.\nMixtures of low boiling point and high boiling point solvents were shown to suppress the coffee ring effect, changing the shape of a deposited solute from a ring-like to a dot-like shape.\n\nControl of the substrate temperature was shown to be an effective way to suppress the coffee ring formed by droplets of water-based solution. On a heated hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrate, a thinner ring with an inner deposit forms, which is attributed to Marangoni convection.\n\nControl of the substrate wetting properties on slippery surfaces can prevent pinning of the drop contact line, which will therefore suppress the coffee ring effect by reducing the number of particles deposited at the contact line. Drops on superhydrophobic or liquid impregnated surfaces are less likely to have a pinned contact line and will suppress ring formation.\n\nAlternating voltage electrowetting may suppress coffee stains without the need to add surface-active materials. Reverse particle motion may also reduce the coffee-ring effect because of the capillary force near the contact line. The reversal takes place when the capillary force prevails over the outward coffee-ring flow by the geometric constraints.\n\nThe lower-limit size of a coffee ring depends on the time scale competition between the liquid evaporation and the movement of suspended particles. When the liquid evaporates much faster than the particle movement near a three-phase contact line, coffee ring cannot be formed successfully. Instead, these particles will disperse uniformly on a surface upon complete liquid evaporation. For suspended particles of size 100 nm, the minimum diameter of the coffee ring structure is found to be 10 μm, or about 10 times smaller than the width of human hair. The shape of particles in the liquid is responsible for coffee ring effect. On porous substrates, the competition among infiltration, particle motion and evaporation of the solvent governs the final deposition morphology.\n\nThe pH of the solution of the drop influences the final deposit pattern. The transition between these patterns is explained by considering how DLVO interactions such as the electrostatic and Van der Waals forces modify the particle deposition process.\n\nThe coffee ring effect is utilized in convective deposition by researchers wanting to order particles on a substrate using capillary-driven assembly, replacing a stationary droplet with an advancing meniscus drawn across the substrate. This process differs from dip-coating in that evaporation drives flow along the substrate as opposed to gravity.\n\nConvective deposition can control particle orientation, resulting in the formation of crystalline monolayer films from nonspherical particles such as hemispherical, dimer, and dumbbell shaped particles. Orientation is afforded by the system trying to reach a state of maximum packing of the particles in the thin meniscus layer over which evaporation occurs. They showed that tuning the volume fraction of particles in solution will control the specific location along the varying meniscus thickness at which assembly occurs. Particles will align with their long axis in- or out-of-plane depending on whether or not their longer dimension of the particle was equal to the thickness of the wetting layer at the meniscus location. Such thickness transitions were established with spherical particles as well. It was later shown that convective assembly could control particle orientation in assembling multi-layers, resulting in long-range 3D colloidal crystals from dumbbell shaped particles. These finds were attractive for the self-assembled of colloidal crystal films for applications such as photonics. Recent advances have increased the application of coffee-ring assembly from colloidal particles to organized patterns of inorganic crystals.\n"}

{"id": "25727150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25727150", "title": "Dravya", "text": "Dravya\n\nDravya () is a term used to refer to a substance. According to the Jain philosophy, the universe is made up of six eternal substances: sentient beings or souls (\"jīva\"), non-sentient substance or matter (\"pudgala\"), principle of motion (\"dharma\"), the principle of rest (\"adharma\"), space (\"ākāśa\") and time (\"kāla\"). The latter five are united as the \"ajiva\" (the non-living). As per the Sanskrit etymology, \"dravya\" means substances or entity, but it may also mean real or fundamental categories.\n\nJain philosophers distinguish a substance from a body, or thing, by declaring the former as a simple element or reality while the latter as a compound of one or more substances or atoms. They claim that there can be a partial or total destruction of a body or thing, but no substance can ever be destroyed. \n\nAccording to Jain philosophy, this universe consists of infinite \"jivas\" or souls that are uncreated and always existing. There are two main categories of souls: un-liberated mundane embodied souls that are still subject to transmigration and rebirths in this \" samsara \" due to karmic bondage and the liberated souls that are free from birth and death. All souls are intrinsically pure but are found in bondage with karma since beginning-less time. A soul has to make efforts to eradicate the karmas attain its true and pure form.\n\n10th-century Jain monk Nemichandra describes the soul in \"Dravyasamgraha\":\n\nThe qualities of the soul are \"chetana\" (consciousness) and \"upyoga\" (knowledge and perception). Though the soul experiences both birth and death, it is neither really destroyed nor created. Decay and origin refer respectively to the disappearing of one state and appearing of another state and these are merely the modes of the soul. Thus Jiva with its attributes and modes, roaming in \"samsara\" (universe), may lose its particular form and assume a new one. Again this form may be lost and the original acquired.\n\nMatter is classified as solid, liquid, gaseous, energy, fine Karmic materials and extra-fine matter i.e. ultimate particles. \"Paramāṇu\" or ultimate particle (atoms or sub-atomic particles) is the basic building block of all matter. It possesses at all times four qualities, namely, a color (\"varna\"), a taste (\"rasa\"), a smell (\"gandha\"), and a certain kind of palpability (\"sparsha\", touch). One of the qualities of the \"paramāṇu\" and \"pudgala\" is that of permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its basic qualities remain the same. It cannot be created nor destroyed and the total amount of matter in the universe remains the same.\n\n\"Dharma\" means the principles of Motion that pervade the entire universe. Dharma and Adharma are by themselves not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without \"Dharma\" motion is not possible. The medium of motion helps matter and the sentient that are prone to motion to move, like water (helps) fish. However, it does not set in motion those that do not move.\n\nWithout \"adharma\", rest and stability is not possible in the universe. The principle of rest helps matter and the sentient that are liable to stay without moving, like the shade helps travellers. It does not stabilize those that move. According to Champat Rai Jain:\n\nSpace is a substance that accommodates the living souls, the matter, the principle of motion, the principle of rest and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points.\n\n\"Kāla\" is a real entity according to Jainism and is said to be the cause of continuity and succession. Champat Rai Jain in his book \"\"The Key of Knowledge\" wrote: Jaina philosophers call the substance of Time as \"Niścay\" Time to distinguish it from \"vyavhāra\" (practical) Time which is a measure of duration- hours, days and the like.\n\nOut of the six \"dravyas\", five except time have been described as \"astikayas\", that is, extensions or conglomerates. Since like conglomerates, they have numerous space points, they are described as \"astikaya\". There are innumerable space points in the sentient substance and in the media of motion and rest, and infinite ones in space; in matter they are threefold (i.e. numerable, innumerable and infinite). Time has only one; therefore it is not a conglomerate. Hence the corresponding conglomerates or extensions are called—\"jivastikaya\" (soul extension or conglomerate), \"pudgalastikaya\" (matter conglomerate), \"dharmastikaya\" (motion conglomerate), \"adharmastikaya\" (rest conglomerate) and \"akastikaya\" (space conglomerates). Together they are called \"pancastikaya\" or the five \"astikayas\".\n\nThese substances have some common attributes or gunas such as:\n\nThere are some specific attributes that distinguish the dravyas from each other:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10921309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10921309", "title": "Energy in Norway", "text": "Energy in Norway\n\nNorway is a large energy producer, and one of the world's largest exporters of oil. \nMost of the electricity in the country is produced by hydroelectricity. \nNorway is one of the leading countries in the electrification of its transport sector, with the largest fleet of electric vehicles per capita in the world (see plug-in electric vehicles in Norway and electric car use by country). \n\nSince the discovery of North Sea oil in Norwegian waters during the late 1960s, exports of oil and gas have become very important elements of the economy of Norway. \nWith North Sea oil production having peaked, disagreements over exploration for oil in the Barents Sea, the prospect of exploration in the Arctic, as well as growing international concern over global warming, energy in Norway is currently receiving close attention.\n\nIn 2011, Norway was the eighth largest crude oil exporter in the world (at 78Mt), and the 9th largest exporter of refined oil (at 86Mt). It was also the world's third largest natural gas exporter (at 99bcm), having significant gas reserves in the North Sea. Norway also possesses some of the world's largest potentially exploitable coal reserves (located under the Norwegian continental shelf) on earth.\n\nNorway's abundant energy resources represent a significant source of national revenue. Crude oil and natural gas accounted for 40% of the country's total export value in 2015. As a share of GDP, the export of oil and natural gas is approximately 17%. As a means to ensure security and mitigate against the “Dutch disease” characterized by fluctuations in the price of oil, the Norwegian government funnels a portion of this export revenue into a pension fund, the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG). The Norwegian government receives these funds from their market shares within oil industries, such as their two-thirds share of Statoil, and allocates it through their government controlled domestic economy. This combination allows the government to distribute the natural resource wealth into welfare investments for the mainland. Tying this fiscal policy to the oil market for equity concerns creates a cost-benefit economic solution towards a public access good problem in which a select few are able to reap the direct benefits of a public good. Domestically, Norway has addressed the complications that occur with oil industry markets in protecting the mainland economy and government intervention in distributing its revenue to combat balance-of-payment shocks and to address energy security.\n\nThe externalities engendered from Norway’s activities on the environment, pose another concern apart from its domestic economic implications. Most of Norwegian gas is exported to European countries, 20% of European gas consumption is from Norway, and Norwegian oil supplies 2% of the global consumption of oil. Considering that three million barrels of oil adds 1.3 Mt of CO2 per day to the atmosphere as it is consumed, 474 Mt/year, the global CO2 impact of Norway’s natural resource supply is significant. Despite that Norway exports eight times the amount of energy consumed domestically, most of Norway’s carbon emissions are from its oil and gas industry at 30% and from road traffic at 23%. To address the problem of CO2 emissions, the Norwegian government has adopted different measures, including signing multilateral and bilateral treaties to cut its emissions in lieu of rising global environmental concerns. \n\nNorway can serve as a role model for many countries in terms of petroleum resource management. In Norway, good institutions and open and dynamic public debate involving a whole variety of civil society actors are key factors for successful petroleum governance. \n\nIn May 1963, Norway asserted sovereign rights over natural resources in its sector of the North Sea. Exploration started on July 19, 1966, when Ocean Traveller drilled its first hole. Initial exploration was fruitless, until Ocean Viking found oil on August 21, 1969. By the end of 1969, it was clear that there were large oil and gas reserves in the North Sea. The first oil field was Ekofisk, which produced 427,442 barrels of crude in 1980. Subsequently, large natural gas reserves have also been discovered and it was specifically this huge amount of oil found in the North Sea that made Norway’s separate path outside the EU possible.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the 1972 Norwegian referendum to not join the European Union, the Norwegian Ministry of Industry, headed by Ola Skjåk Bræk moved quickly to establish a national energy policy. Norway decided to stay out of OPEC, keep its own energy prices in line with world markets, and spend the revenue—known as the \"currency gift\"—in the Petroleum Fund of Norway. The Norwegian government established its own oil company, Statoil, and awarded drilling and production rights to Norsk Hydro and the newly formed Saga Petroleum.\n\nThe North Sea turned out to present many technical challenges for production and exploration, and Norwegian companies invested in building capabilities to meet these challenges. A number of engineering and construction companies emerged from the remnants of the largely lost shipbuilding industry, creating centers of competence in Stavanger and the western suburbs of Oslo. Stavanger also became the land-based staging area for the offshore drilling industry. Due to refinery needs when making special qualities of commercial oils, Norway imported NOK 3.5 billion of foreign oil in 2015.\n\nIn March 2005, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Petersen stated that the Barents Sea, off the coast of Norway and Russia, may hold one third of the world's remaining undiscovered oil and gas.\nAlso in 2005, the moratorium on exploration in the Norwegian sector, imposed in 2001 due to environmental concerns, was lifted following a change in government. A terminal and liquefied natural gas plant is now being constructed at Snøhvit and, as the Arctic ice cap shrinks due to global warming, it is thought that Snøhvit may also act as a future staging post for oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean.\n\nElectricity generation in Norway is almost entirely from hydroelectric power plants. Of the total production in 2005 of 137.8 TWh, 136 TWh was from hydroelectric plants, 0.86 TWh was from thermal power, and 0.5 TWh was wind generated. In 2005 the total consumption was 125.8 TWh.\n\nNorway was the first country to generate electricity commercially using sea-bed tidal power. A 300 kilowatt prototype underwater turbine started generation in the Kvalsund, south of Hammerfest, on November 13, 2003. \n\nNorway and Sweden's grids have long been connected. \nBeginning in 1977 the Norwegian and Danish grids were connected with the Skagerrak power transmission system with a transmission capacity of 500 MW, growing to 1,700 MW in 2015. \nSince 6 May 2008, the Norwegian and Dutch electricity grids are interconnected by NorNed submarine HVDC (450 kilovolts) cable with a capacity of 700 megawatts. \n\nDespite producing the majority of its electricity from hydroelectric plants, Norway is ranked 30th in the 2008 list of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita and 37th in the 2004 list of countries by ratio of GDP to carbon dioxide emissions. Norway is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, under which it agreed to reduce its carbon emissions to no more than 1% above 1990 levels by 2012.\n\nOn April 19, 2007, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg announced to the Labour Party annual congress that Norway's greenhouse gas emissions would be cut by 10 percent more than its Kyoto commitment by 2012, and that the government had agreed to achieve emission cuts of 30% by 2020. He also proposed that Norway should become carbon neutral by 2050, and called upon other rich countries to do likewise. This carbon neutrality would be achieved partly by carbon offsetting, a proposal criticised by Greenpeace, who also called on Norway to take responsibility for the 500 m tonnes of emissions caused by its exports of oil and gas. World Wildlife Fund Norway also believes that the purchase of carbon offsets is unacceptable, saying \"it is a political stillbirth to believe that China will quietly accept that Norway will buy climate quotas abroad\". The Norwegian environmental activist Bellona Foundation believes that the prime minister was forced to act due to pressure from anti-European Union members of the coalition government, and called the announcement \"visions without content\".\n\nIn January 2008 the Norwegian government went a step further and declared a goal of being carbon neutral by 2030. But the government has not been specific about any plans to reduce emissions at home; the plan is based on buying carbon offsets from other countries.\n\nNorway was the first country to operate an industrial-scale carbon capture and storage project at the Sleipner oilfield, dating from 1996 and operated by Statoil. Carbon dioxide is stripped from natural gas with amine solvents and is deposited in a saline formation. The carbon dioxide is a waste product of the field's natural gas production; the gas contains 9% CO, more than is allowed in the natural gas distribution network. Storing it underground avoids this problem and saves Statoil hundreds of millions of euros in carbon taxes. Sleipner stores about one million tonnes of CO a year.\n\n\n"}

The plan was launched in March 2007, and after months of tough negotiations between the member countries, it was adopted by the European Parliament on December 2008. The package focuses on emissions cuts, renewables and energy efficiency.\n\n10 January 2007: The European Commission presented a series of proposals setting ambitious targets of greenhouse gases reduction. It announced the EU would commit itself to reducing emissions of developed countries by 30% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2020 in international negotiations. In addition, the Commission planned its commitment to reduce its domestic emissions by at least 20% by 2020.\n\n8–9 March 2007: The European Council approved of the objectives of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases presented by the Commission on 10 January 2007. As part of a plan of action on energy policy for the period 2007–2009, it also supported the 20-20-20 targets.\n\n23 January 2008: The European Commission presented the definitive package, including proposals outlined by the European Council. The plan was to be discussed and adopted by the European Council in March 2008. The Commission also proposed to extend the system of emissions trading, to impose reductions of GHG emissions to economic sectors that are not covered by the system, and to promote renewable energies.\n\n13–14 March 2008: The European Council agreed on the guiding principles of the package and set an agenda.\n\n11–18 December 2008: Discussion about the package during the European Council, and definitive adoption of the package by the European Parliament.\n\nDecember 2009: World Climate Conference in Copenhagen to find an international agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change, which expires at the end of 2012.\n\nAfter the Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997 by most European countries but expiring in 2012, a new international agreement to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases was to be negotiated at Poznan (Poland) and in Copenhagen in 2009. To play a leading role in these negotiations, the European Union wanted to develop as quickly as possible a common position in the fight against climate change, and thus implemented its own measures to deal with climate change.\n\nMeeting on 8 and 9 March 2007, the European Council adopted new environmental targets even more ambitious than that of the Kyoto Protocol. The plan included the so-called \"three 20 targets\", but in reality it consisted in four proposals. These aims were:\n\nAfter having launched the negotiations on the package by proposing to implement measures to fight against climate change on January 2007, the European Commission proposed new measures a year later. The proposals include the three \"20 targets\" of the previous European Council.\n\nThe new guidelines set by the Commission proposed a limit of emissions by vehicles, to develop capture and storage of , to invite each member state to reduce their greenhouse gases emissions, and to reform the European emission trading system. This last proposal was subject to much debate between the member states. The Commission proposed first to extend this system from 2013, and to extend it to all greenhouse gases instead of restricting it to emissions. It also proposed to extend emission ceilings to more sectors and industries. It finally planned to end free allocation and to switch to paying quotas in 2013 for all power producers, and by 2020 for other industries.\n\nThe plan was concluded rapidly: it was adopted at the European Council on 11 and 12 December 2008, and was voted by the European Parliament one week later. The initial deadline for the adoption of the package in the Parliament was March 2009. However, protests from some countries arose regarding the modalities for achieving these objectives, notably because of the economic and financial crisis, which caused tough negotiations between countries.\n\nThe European Council of 11 and 12 December 2008 definitively adopted the package, but modified the initial measures. The 27 Heads of State and governments finally agreed to implement the 20-20-20 targets: by 2020, reduce by 20% the emissions of greenhouse gases, increase by 20% the energy efficiency in the EU and to reach 20% of renewables in total energy consumption in the EU. As for the auctioning of emission of greenhouse gases, a gradual introduction is scheduled: companies will have to buy 20% of allowances from 2013, 70% in 2020 and 100% in 2027. However, if no international agreement is reached in the next years, the industrial companies most exposed to international competition will benefit free allocation of quotas. Finally, in the sector of electricity, exceptions are envisaged for the new member states until 2020, while the auctioning of all the allowances will be effective from 2013 for other EU members. The package was then submitted to the European Parliament from 15 to 18 December.\n\nDuring the negotiations, some member states have expressed concerns about the increase in energy costs caused by the implementation of the package: the increase could be of 10% to 15% by 2020. Above all, several countries were concerned about the supposed consequences of the auctioning of all emissions of greenhouse gases on electricity prices, on the one hand, and above all on the competitiveness of the most polluting industrial companies.\n\nPoland and most new member states, whose electricity relies mainly on coal, fear that this reform, increasing electricity prices, could undermine their economic growth and their energy security. They wanted to benefit from a derogation allowing a progressive switch to paying quotas, starting at 20% in 2013 to reach 100% in 2020. Poland and the Baltic States also claimed that the package would force them to develop their gas imports from Russia to reduce their GHG emissions, limiting their energy independence. The member states responded by proposing to improve the electrical interconnections of these countries with the European market. In late October, the Prime Ministers of Poland, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania agreed to establish a plan of energy interconnection.\n\nOn the other hand, member states disputed on how to avoid the outsourcings of the most polluting industries, subject to competition of rivals from countries with little involvement in the fight against global warming. Germany proposed the allocation of free emission quotas to the most vulnerable (especially steel industry) companies.\n\n"}

Some fjords and channels are important navigable channels providing access to ports like Punta Arenas, Puerto Chacabuco and Puerto Natales.\n\nDuring colonial times, the fjords and channels of Patagonia were first explored by the Spaniards. There were a number of motivations for their explorations, including a desire to Christianize indigenous peoples, to prevent intrusions of any foreign power into territory claimed by Spain, to increase geographic knowledge of the zone, and finally, to search for a mythical city called City of the Caesars. In 1792, the viceroy of Peru ordered the exploration of the Patagonian channels in order to find an entrance to the interior of Patagonia. The said order was carried of by José de Moraleda who led an expedition that visited many of the main channels of the zone. In the early to mid 19th century, explorations by hydrographers like Robert FitzRoy and Francisco Hudson increased knowledge on the channels. The channels south of the Isthmus of Ofqui were explored in detail by Chilean government agent Hans Steffen in the late 19th century.\n\nThis route is mostly used by vessels desiring to avoid the heavy seas and bad weather so often experienced on passing into the Pacific Ocean from the western end of the Strait of Magellan. The large full-powered mail steamers generally at once gain the open sea at Cape Pillar (at the west entrance of the Strait of Magellan), as experience has shown that time is thus saved to them; but vessels of less engine power, to which punctuality and dispatch is not so much an object as avoiding possible danger, will find the Patagonian Channels the best route.\n\nThe general features of these channels are high, abrupt shores, with innumerable peaks and headlands remarkably alike in character, their bold, rugged heads giving an appearance of gloomy grandeur rarely seen elsewhere. The shores are generally steep-to and the channels, for the most part, open and free, while the few dangers that exist are usually marked by kelp. The tides are regular and not strong, except in the English Narrows.\n\nIn the case of the two above mentioned and some other fjords, these waterways proved of value as transport lanes when western Patagonia was settled and incorporated into Chile. On the other hand, the fjords have served as a natural barrier preventing north-south land travel in Chilean Patagonia.\n\nAll waters between the Chilean baselines and the continental shoreline are internal waters, according to the Chilean decree 416 of 14 June 1977 based in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, that is, the coastal nation is free to set laws, regulate any use, and use any resource. Foreign vessels have no right of passage within internal waters, and this lack of right to innocent passage is the key difference between internal waters and territorial waters.

There are 150 major ships sailing in the southern regions of Chile.\n\nCruise ships also operate between the main ports of the region and offer a journey that is considered an experience in itself, due to the slow way of entering this magnificent landscape of narrow channels and solitary islands.\n\nThe Carretera Austral requires the use of three ferries: a 30-minute crossing about south of the start of the highway in Puerto Montt, a 5-hour crossing from Hornopirén ( south of Puerto Montt) to Caleta Gonzalo and a 50-minute crossing from Puerto Yungay to Rio Bravo, connecting to the final of the highway.\n\nWith the exception of Chiloé Island, the region is sparsely inhabited. The main ports are: Puerto Montt, Quellón, Chaitén, Melinka, Puerto Chacabuco, Puyuguapi, Puerto Natales, Punta Arenas, Porvenir and Puerto Williams.\n\nSouth of Chiloé, there are also small ports like Villa Puerto Edén, Bahía Corbeta Papudo on Guarello Island, Puerto Bories, Puerto Navarino, Puerto Toro, and Caleta Eugenia.\n\nIn order to open a direct passage from the Moraleda Channel to the Messier Channel without to go out into the open Pacific Ocean to round the Taitao Peninsula, the Chilean Government ordered in 1937 the construction of a canal from the San Rafael Lagoon through the isthmus (2,200 m long, 17 m wide, 5 m depth) to the Negro River, that later should be dredged . 1937 began the work on the ground, under the management of the railways department of the Ministry of Public Works. Work continued until May 1943 when funds ran out. The map on the right shows the \"Laguna San Rafael\" and the \"Golfo Elefantes\", they are the southernmost part of the Moraleda Channel. The \"Golfo San Esteban\" can be seen as the northernmost part of the Messier Channel.\n\nThe Chacao Channel bridge, also known as Chiloé Bicentennial Bridge, is a planned bridge that is to link the island of Chiloé with mainland Chile crossing the Chacao Channel. It was one of the several projects that were planned to commemorate the Chile's bicentennial in 2010. If completed as a suspension bridge, it would be the largest such bridge in South America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to local myth, Gaoua was founded when the Lobi migrated across from northern Ghana where they found the Gan people peoples occupying the territory. As a result, they named the trek across to Gaoua \"Gan-houo\" meaning \"route of the Gan people\".\nAttractions in the town include a sacred grove of trees, the Poni Museum (\"Musée des Civilisations des Peuples du Sud-Ouest\" or \"Musée du Poni\") and caves. There is also a mosque on elevated ground near the centre. The Gaoua Catholic parish Church of the Sacred Heart will be the cathedral for the newly erected Catholic Diocese of Gaoua.\n\nThough their ancient home was considered to be Takyiman in Ghana, the Lobi migrated across the Mouhoun River as a result of the Dagomba Wars in the 1770s. Thirty years later, the Lobi displaced the Gan at Gaoua. The French occupied southwest Burkina Faso in 1879, based on the region's reputation for gold, dating back to the era of Mossi and Dyula gold traders. Although primarily farmers, the Lobi did partake of gold panning around Gaoua, besides Gaoua being on a trade route to the Poura gold mines further north.\n\n"}

It was originally published in his doctoral thesis \"Studies of the morphological activity of rivers as illustrated by the River Fyris.\" in 1935. The graph takes sediment particle size and water velocity into account. \n\nThe upper curve shows the critical erosion velocity in cm/s as a function of particle size in mm, while the lower curve shows the deposition velocity as a function of particle size. Note that the axes are logarithmic. \n\nThe plot shows several key concepts about the relationships between erosion, transportation, and deposition. For particle sizes where friction is the dominating force preventing erosion, the curves follow each other closely and the required velocity increases with particle size. However, for cohesive sediment, mostly clay but also silt, the \"erosion\" velocity increases with decreasing grain size, as the cohesive forces are relatively more important when the particles get smaller. The critical velocity for deposition, on the other hand, depends on the settling velocity, and that decreases with decreasing grainsize. The Hjulström curve shows that sand particles of a size around 0.1 mm require the lowest stream velocity to erode.\n\nThe curve was expanded by Åke Sundborg in 1956. He significantly improved the level of detail in the cohesive part of the diagram, and added lines for different modes of transportation. The result is called the \"Sundborg diagram\", or the \"Hjulström-Sundborg Diagram\", in the academic literature.\n\nThis curve dates back to early 20th century research on river geomorphology and has no more than a historical value nowadays, although its simplicity is still attractive. Among the drawbacks of this curve are that it does not take the water depth into account and more importantly, that it does not show that sedimentation is caused by flow velocity \"deceleration\" and erosion is caused by flow \"acceleration\". The dimensionless Shields Diagram is now unanimously accepted for initiation of sediment motion in rivers. Much work was done on river sediment transport formulae in the second half of the 20th century and that work should be used preferably to Hjulström's curve.\n\n"}
{"id": "25340494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25340494", "title": "Ice lens", "text": "Ice lens\n\nIce lenses are bodies of ice formed when moisture, diffused within soil or rock, accumulates in a localized zone. The ice initially accumulates within small collocated pores or pre-existing crack, and, as long as the conditions remain favorable, continues to collect in the ice layer or ice lens, wedging the soil or rock apart. Ice lenses grow parallel to the surface and several centimeters to several decimeters (inches to feet) deep in the soil or rock. Studies between 1990 and present have demonstrated that rock fracture by ice segregation (i.e., the fracture of intact rock by ice lenses that grow by drawing water from their surroundings during periods of sustained subfreezing temperatures) is a more effective weathering process than the freeze-thaw process which older texts proposed.\n\nIce lenses play a key role in frost induced heaving of soils and fracture of bedrock, which are fundamental to weathering in cold regions. Frost heaving creates debris and dramatically shapes landscapes into complex patterns. Although rock fracture in periglacial regions (alpine, subpolar and polar) has often been attributed to the freezing and volumetric expansion of water trapped within pores and cracks, the majority of frost heaving and of bedrock fracture results instead from ice segregation and lens growth in the near-surface frozen regions. Ice segregation results in rock fracture and frost heave.\n\nFrost heave is the process by which the freezing of water-saturated soil causes the deformation and upward thrust of the ground surface. This process can distort and crack pavement, damage the foundations of buildings and displace soil in regular patterns. Moist, fine-grained soil at certain temperatures is most susceptible to frost heaving.\n\nFrost heave is common in arctic tundra because the permafrost maintains ground frozen at depth and prevents snowmelt and rain from draining. As a result, conditions are optimal for deep ice lens formation with large ice accumulations and significant soil displacement.\n\nDifferential frost heave producing complex patterns will occur if the correct conditions exist. Feedback from one year's frost heave influences the effects in subsequent years. For example, a small increase in overburden will affect the depth of ice formation and heaving in the subsequent years. Time-dependent models of the frost heave indicate that over a long enough period the short-separation perturbations damp out, while mid-range perturbations grow and come to dominate the landscape.\n\nBands of sediment or glacial till have been observed below Antarctic ice sheets; these are believed to result from ice lenses forming in the debris. In the faster flowing glacial regions, the ice sheet is sliding over water saturated sediments (glacial till) or actually being floated upon a layer of water. The till and water served to reduce friction between the base of the ice sheet and the bedrock. These subglacial waters come from surface water which seasonally drains from melting at the surface, as well as from ice-sheet base melting.\n\nIce lens growth within the bedrock below the glacier is projected during the summer months when there is ample water at the base of the glacier. Ice lenses will form within the bedrock, accumulating until the rock is sufficiently weakened that it shears or spalls off. Layers of rock along the interface between glaciers and the bedrock are freed, producing much of the sediments in these basal regions of glaciers. Since the rate of glacier movement is dependent upon the characteristics of this basal ice, research is ongoing to better quantify the phenomena.\n\nThe basic condition for ice segregation and frost heaving is existence of a region in soil or porous rock which is relatively permeable, is in a temperature range which allows the coexistence of ice and water (in a premelted state), and has a temperature gradient across the region.\n\nA key phenomenon for understanding ice segregation in soil or porous rock (also referred to as an ice lens due to its shape) is premelting, which is the development of a liquid film on surfaces and interfaces at temperatures significantly below their bulk melting temperature. The term premelting is used to describe the reduction in the melting temperature (below 0 °C) which results from the surface curvature of water that's confined in a porous medium (the Gibbs-Thomson effect). Premelted water exists as a thin layer on the surface of ice. Under premelting conditions, ice and water can coexist at temperatures below -10 °C in a porous medium. The Gibbs-Thomson effect results in water migrating down a thermal gradient (from higher temperatures to lower temperatures); Dash states, “…material is carried to colder regions…” This can also be viewed energetically as favoring larger ice particles over smaller (Ostwald ripening). As a result, when conditions exist for ice segregation (ice lens formation) water flows toward the segregated ice and freezes on the surface, thickening the segregated ice layer.\n\nIt is possible to develop analytic models using these principles; they predict the following characteristics, which are consistent with field observations: \n\nRocks routinely contain pores of varying size and shape, regardless of origin or location. Rock voids are essentially small cracks, and serve as the location from which a crack can propagate if the rock is placed in tension. If ice accumulates in a pore asymmetrically, the ice will place the rock in tension in a plane perpendicular to the ice accumulation direction. Hence the rock will crack along a plane perpendicular to the direction of ice accumulation, which is effectively parallel to the surface.\n\nWalder and Hallet developed models that predict rock crack-growth locations and rates consistent with fractures actually observed in the field. Their model predicted that marble and granite grow cracks most effectively when the temperatures range from a −4 °C to −15 °C; in this range granite may develop fractures enclosing ice 3 meters in length in a year. When the temperature is higher the ice which is formed does not apply enough pressure to cause the crack to propagate. When the temperature is below this range the water is less mobile and cracks grow more slowly.\n\nMutron confirmed that ice initially forms in pores and creates small microfractures parallel to the surface. As ice accumulates, the ice layer grows outward in what is frequently characterized as an ice-lens parallel to the surface. Ice will form in water-permeable rock in much the same way as it forms in soil. If the ice layer resulted from cooling from a single direction (e.g., the top) the rock fracture tends to lie close to the surface(e.g., 1–2 cm in chalk). If the ice layer results from freezing from both sides (e.g., above and below) the rock fracture tends to lie deeper (e.g., 2-3.5 cm in chalk).\n\nThe formation of an ice sphere can happen when an object is about 0.5 ft - 1 ft above where the water reaches repeatedly. The water will form a thin layer of ice on any surface it reaches. Each wave is an advancement and recession of water. The advancement soaks everything on the shore. When the wave recedes, it's left exposed to freezing temperatures. This brief moment of exposure causes a thin layer of ice to form. When that formation is suspended in the air by dead vegetation or erect objects, the ice will begin to form a sphere or teardrop-like shape. Similar to how a condensation nucleus forms, the sphere needs a base that is not water. Most commonly on vegetation, the sphere starts as a dot of ice on a branch or stem. As waves soak the shore in water and briefly expose the soaked objects to freezing temperatures, the dot begins to grow as each thin layer wraps itself around the previous layer. Over time, they form spheres or teardrop-like formations\n"}

The Great Barrier Reef, considered one of the seven natural wonders of the world and a biodiversity hotspot, is located in Australia. Similar to other coral reefs, it is experiencing degradation due to ocean acidification. Ocean acidification results from a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is taken up by the ocean. This process can increase sea surface temperature, decrease aragonite, and lower the pH of the ocean.\n\nCalcifying organisms are under risk, due to the resulting lack of aragonite in the water and the decreasing pH. This decreased health of coral reefs, particularly the Great Barrier Reef, can result in reduced biodiversity. Organisms can become stressed due to ocean acidification and the disappearance of healthy coral reefs, such as the Great Barrier Reef, is a loss of habitat for several taxa. \nAtmospheric carbon dioxide has risen from 280 to 380 ppm since the industrial revolution. This increase in carbon dioxide has led to a 0.1 decrease in pH, and it could decrease by 0.5 by 2100. When carbon dioxide meets seawater it forms carbonic acid, which then dissociates into hydrogen, bicarbonate, and carbonate and lowers the pH of the ocean. Sea surface temperature, ocean acidity, and dissolved inorganic carbon are also positively correlated with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Ocean acidification can cause hypercapnia and increase stress in marine organisms, thereby leading to decreasing biodiversity. Coral reefs themselves can also be negatively affected by ocean acidification, as calcification rates decrease as acidity increases.\n\nAragonite is impacted by the process of ocean acidification, because it is a form of calcium carbonate. It is essential in coral viability and health, because it is found in coral skeletons and is more readily soluble than calcite. Increasing carbon dioxide levels can reduce coral growth rates from 9 to 56%. Other calcifying organisms, such as bivalves and gastropods, experience negative effects due to ocean acidification as well.\n\nAs a biodiversity hotspot, the many taxa of the Great Barrier Reef are threatened by ocean acidification. Rare and endemic species are in greater danger due to ocean acidification, because they rely upon the Great Barrier Reef more extensively. Additionally, the risk of coral reefs collapsing due to acidification poses a threat to biodiversity. The stress of ocean acidification could also negatively affect biological processes, such as photosynthesis or reproduction, and allow organisms to become vulnerable to disease.\n\nCoral is a calcifying organism, putting it at high risk for decay and slow growth rates as ocean acidification increases. Aragonite, which impacts the ability of coral to take up CaCO, decreases when pH decreases. Levels of aragonite have decreased by 16% since industrialization, and could be lower in some portions of the Great Barrier Reef because the current allows northern corals to take up more aragonite than the southern corals. Aragonite is predicted to reduce by 0.1 by 2100. Since 1990, calcification rates of \"Porites\", a common large reef-building coral in the Great Barrier Reef, have decreased by 14.2% annually. Aragonite levels across the Great Barrier Reef itself are not equal; due to currents and circulation, some portions of the Great Barrier Reef can have half as much aragonite as others. Levels of aragonite are also affected by calcification and production, which can vary from reef to reef. If atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches 560 ppm, most ocean surface waters will be adversely undersaturated with respect to aragonite and the pH will have reduced by about 0.24 units – from almost 8.2 today to just over 7.9. At this point (sometime in the third quarter of this century at current rates of increase) only a few parts of the Pacific will have levels of aragonite saturation adequate for coral growth. Additionally, if atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches 800 ppm, the ocean surface water pH decrease will be 0.4 units and total dissolved carbonate ion concentration will have decreased by at least 60%. At this point it is almost certain that all reefs of the world will be in erosional states. Increasing the pH and replicating pre-industrialization ocean chemistry conditions in the Great Barrier Reef, however, led to an increase in coral growth rates by 7%.\n\nOcean acidification can also lead to increased sea surface temperature. An increase of about 1 or 2 °C can cause the collapse of the relationship between coral and zooxanthellae, possibly leading to bleaching. Average sea surface temperature in the Great Barrier Reef is predicted to increase between 1 and 3 °C by 2100. This breakdown of the relationship between the coral and the zooxanthellae occurs when Photosystem II is damaged, either due to a reaction with the D1 protein or a lack of carbon dioxide fixation; these result in a lack of photosynthesis and can lead to bleaching.\n\nOcean acidification threatens coral reproduction throughout almost all aspects of the process.Gametogenesis may be indirectly affected by coral bleaching. Additionally, the stress that acidification puts on coral can potentially harm the viability of the sperm released. Larvae can also be affected by this process; metabolism and settlement cues could be altered, changing the size of population or viability of reproduction. Other species of calcifying larvae have shown reduced growth rates under ocean acidification scenarios. Biofilm, a bioindicator for oceanic conditions, underwent reduced growth rate and altered composition in acidification, possibly affecting larval settlement on the biofilm itself.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is a biodiversity hotspot, but it is threatened by ocean acidification and its resulting increased temperature and reduced levels of aragonite. Elasmobranchs in the Great Barrier Reef are vulnerable to ocean acidification primarily due to their reliance on the habitat and ocean acidification's destruction of coral reefs. Rare and endemic species, such as the porcupine ray, are at high risk as well. Larval health and settlement of both calcifying and non-calcifying organisms can be harmed by ocean acidification. A predator to coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef, the Crown of Thorns sea star, has experienced a similar death rate to the coral on which it feeds. Any increase in nutrients, possibly from river run-off, can positively affect the Crown of Thorns and lead to further destruction of the coral.\n\nCoralline algae holds together some coral reefs and is present in multiple ecosystems. As ocean acidification intensifies, however, it will not respond well and could damage the viability and structural integrity of coral reefs. Ocean acidification can also indirectly affect any organism; increased stress can reduce photosynthesis and reproduction, or make organisms more vulnerable to disease. Additionally, as coral reefs decay, their symbiotic relationships and residents will have to adapt or find new habitats on which to rely.\n\nOrganisms have been found to be more sensitive to the effects of ocean acidification in early, larval or planktonic stages. As ocean acidification does not exist in a vacuum, the multiple problems facing the Great Barrier Reef combine to further stress the organisms. Not only can ocean acidification affect habitat and development, but it can also affect how organisms view predators and conspecifics. Studies on the effects of ocean acidification have not been performed on long enough time scales to see if organisms can adapt to these conditions. However, ocean acidification is predicted to occur at a rate that evolution cannot match. Increasing temperature is also affecting the behavior and fitness of the common coral trout, a very important fish in sustaining the health of coral reefs.\n"}

{"id": "51444569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51444569", "title": "Intelligence Act (France)", "text": "Intelligence Act (France)\n\nThe French Intelligence Act of 24 July 2015 (French: \"loi relative au renseignement\") is a statute passed by the French Parliament. The law creates a new chapter in the Code of Internal Security aimed at regulating the surveillance programs of French intelligence agencies, in particular those of the DGSI (domestic intelligence) and the DGSE (foreign intelligence).\n\nThe Intelligence Bill was introduced to the Parliament on 19 March 2015 by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls and presented as the government's reaction to the Charlie Hebdo shooting. Despite widespread mobilization, the Bill was adopted with 438 votes in favor, 86 against and 42 abstentions\nat the National Assembly and 252 for, 67 against and 26 abstentions at the Senate. It was made into law on 24 July 2015.\n\nAlthough framed by the government as a response to the Paris attacks of January 2015, the passage of the Intelligence Act was actually long in the making. The previous law providing a framework for the surveillance programs of French intelligence agencies was the Wiretapping Act of 1991, aimed at regulating telephone wiretaps. Many surveillance programs developed in the 2000s—especially to monitor Internet communications—were rolled out outside of any legal framework. As early as 2008, the French government's White Paper of Defense and National Security stressed that \"intelligence activities do not have the benefit of a clear and sufficient legal framework\", and said that \"legislative adjustments\" were necessary.\n\nThis section summarizes the main provisions of the Intelligence Act.\n\nThrough article L. 811-3, the Act extended the number of objectives that can justify extrajudicial surveillance. These include:\n\nThese surveillance powers can also be used by law enforcement agencies that are not part of the official \"intelligence community\" and whose combined staff is well over 45,000.\n\nThe existing oversight commission, the \"Commission nationale de contrôle des interceptions de sécurité\", was replaced by a new oversight body called the \"National Oversight Commission for Intelligence-Gathering Techniques\" (\"Commission nationale de contrôle des techniques de renseignement\", or CNCTR). It is composed of:\n\n\nThe CNCTR has 24 hours to issue its \"ex ante\" non-binding opinion regarding the surveillance authorizations delivered by the Prime Minister before surveillance begins, except in cases of \"absolute emergency\" where it is simply notified of the surveillance measure within 24 hours upon deliverance (article L. 821-3).\n\nFor \"ex post\" oversight, the CNCTR has \"permanent, comprehensive and direct access to records, logs, collected intelligence, transcripts and extractions\" of collected data. It is able to conduct both planned and in the premises where these documents are centralized (article L. 833-2-2). If an irregularity is found, it can send to the Prime Minister a \"recommendation\" so that she can put an end to it. One hugely significant exception to the CNCTR's oversight powers are the bulk of data obtained through data-sharing with foreign intelligence agencies (article L. 833-2-3).\n\nTechniques of communications surveillance covered by the Act include telephone or Internet wiretaps (L. 852-1), access to identifying data and other metadata (L. 851-1), geotagging (L. 851-4) and computer network exploitation (L. 853-2), all of which are subject to authorization of a renewable duration of 4 months.\n\nThe Act authorizes the use of scanning device (nicknamed \"black boxes\") to be installed on the infracturstures of telecom operators and hosting providers. Article L. 851-3 of the Code of Internal Security provides that, \"for the sole purpose of preventing terrorism, automated processing techniques may be imposed on the networks of [telecom operators and hosting providers] in order to detect, according to selectors specified in the authorisation, communications that are likely to reveal a terrorist threat.\n\nAnother provision limited to anti-terrorism allows for the real-time collection of metadata (article L. 851-3, for terrorism only and for a 4 months period). Initially, the provision targeted only individuals \"identified as a [terrorist] threat\". After the 2016 Nice Attack, it was extended by a Bill of the state of emergency to cover individuals \"likely to be related to a threat\" or who simply belong to \"the entourage\" of individuals \"likely related to a threat\". According to La Quadrature du Net, this means that the provision can now potentially cover \"hundreds or even thousands of persons (...) rather than just the 11 700 individuals\" reported to be on the French terrorism watchlist.\n\nThe Act authorizes computer network exploitation, or computer hacking, as a method for intelligence gathering. Article L. 853-2 allows for:\n\nConsidering the intrusiveness of computer hacking, the law provides that these techniques are authorized for a duration of 30 days, and only \"when intelligence cannot be collected by any other legally authorized mean.\"\n\nThe Act also grants blanket immunity to intelligence officers who carry on computer crimes into computer systems located abroad (article 323-8 of the Criminal Code).\n\nThe Act also provides chapter on the \"surveillance of international communications\", particularly relevant for the DGSE's surveillance programs. International communications are defined as \"communications emitted from or received abroad\" (article L. 854-1 and following). They can be intercepted and exploited in bulk on the French territory with reduced oversight.

It runs from Kazakhstan's Caspian shore to Xinjiang in China. The pipeline is owned by the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and the Kazakh oil company KazMunayGas.\n\nThe construction of pipeline was agreed between China and Kazakhstan in 1997. The first section of pipeline from the Aktobe region's oil fields to the Atyrau was completed in 2003. The construction of pipeline from to Alashankou started in September 2004 and was completed in December 2005. The construction of Kenkiyak–Kumkol section was agreed between Kazakhstan and China on 18 August 2007.

The basin has a semi-elliptical shape that extends on a north–south axis, with roughly length and width. The average depth is . It is located in the Eastern Ranges, on the anticlinal of Nemocón, in the northeast of the department, at an altitude of .\n\nGeologically, the lake is of Pleistocene origin and is linked to the formation of the Eastern Ranges, which had a strong uprising activity during the Pliocene. Because of its location there is a wide distribution of sedimentary rocks, and the Guadalupe Group, Guaduas, Bogotá and Cacho formations are present in the area. The basin is crossed along its axis by the Suesca Fault, uplifting sandstone.\n\nThe soils of the basin are classified as alfisols, where erosion areas are classified as \"bad soils\". Generally these correspond to cold and dry climates, with corrugated relief and highly evolved soils, where the presence of erosion is common, and most horizons have enrichment with clay. These soils were formed during the Pliocene and Quaternary, containing deposits of volcanic ash from the Cordillera Central, which weathered into clays, currently present in the lower strata.\n\nThe original vegetation was composed of encenillo and \"corono\" forests, accompanied by more xerophytic Andean communities, which correspond to the Low montane dry forest (bs-MB) according to the Holdridge life zones. The actual land cover is dominated by exotic species, mostly \"Acacia decurrens\", with few remnants of native vegetation in the north and south of the basin.\n\nFrom a climatic point of view, the region has a bimodal rainfall regime, with an annual average of 647 mm, average temperatures of 14 °C, 70% relative humidity and evaporation of 1331 mm/year. The winds are a determinant factor for the vegetation and climate, as they are mainly influenced by Sabana de Bogotá, Magdalena River Valley and the Orinoco Plains, which converge in the area to generate specific characteristics from the point of view of moisture and the feasibility of rainfall.\n\nThe region is under the jurisdiction of the Corporación Autonoma Regional de Cundinamarca (CAR) (environmental authority) and its central axis (north–south) serves as the boundary between the municipalities of Cucunubá and Suesca.\n\nAs with various other lakes on the Altiplano, Tota, Siecha, Guatavita and Iguaque, the Muisca who were the original inhabitants of the area before the Spanish conquest of the Muisca, performed religious rituals at Lake Suesca.\n\nThe basin has suffered severe deforestation and erosion, which together have negatively affected the lake ecosystem, which added to the impact of climate change have led to a significant reduction of the water surface. Plans for sustainable development are made in recent years.\n\nSince 1970, a soil remediation process with \"Acaia decurrens\", \"Pinus patula\" and \"Eucalyptus globulus\" was started, but due to the lack of management, the problems related with water scarcity due to the reduction of runoff and water contained in the soil increased. Nowadays the entire basin is located within a forest reserve that has little management by the authorities.\n\nBy oral tradition, it is known that the lake had a great variety of species, such as \"Guapucha\" \"(\") and \"Capitan de la Sabana\" (\"Eremophilus mutisii\"), now locally extinct due to the desiccation of the water body and the introduction of carp and trout, which also disappeared by the same effect of El Niño in 1998.\n\nThe lake is an important stop-over for many migratory birds, but few counting exercises have been made in the area.\n\n\n\n"}

Liquid latex contains about one-third latex, two-thirds water (plus less than one percent ammonia to keep the latex from spoiling and to control the pH of the solution). Liquid latex is sold in jars ranging from 2 oz. through gallon jugs and the consistency is similar to latex house paint. A four-ounce jar can typically cover an average sized body. It is typically applied using a disposable sponge and takes about five to ten minutes to dry depending on how thick it is applied. As it dries it solidifies to a rubbery consistency and in the processes ends up shrinking about three percent.\n\nAs the latex dries it becomes very sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over. Most manufacturers offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry to take away the stickiness allowing the movement of the model's limbs. Alternatively, shimmer powders can be dusted over dried liquid latex to create metallic effects. One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.\n\nUnlike most other body and face paints, liquid latex is removed by peeling it off since water does not reactivate it. Peeling the latex from the skin can be painful to some people and does tend to pull body hairs out similar to waxing. Even though latex is non-toxic, some people can have an allergic reaction. The most severe of these happen immediately and are categorised as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. Cosmetic liquid latex contains approximately 0.3% ammonia to increase shelf-life. Craft and mould making latex can contain more than double this amount and as a result has a much stronger odour. The fumes from the ammonia in liquid latex can irritate the eyes when used as special effect make up on the face. For this reason it is recommended that liquid latex be allowed to vent for several minutes before being applied in this way. Appropriate liquid latex safety guidelines should be followed before the cosmetic use of liquid latex.\n\nLatex is a natural ingredient that comes from rubber trees in the form of a milky liquid. There are thousands of species of plants that produce different types of latex, including the Chicle tree that yields the raw material for producing the rubbery material in chewing gum. Unlike some rubber compounds, rubber tree latex is non-toxic in both its liquid and solid states, and because of this it can be found in many products such as surgical gloves, condoms and body paint. Liquid latex is naturally clear and then dries into a translucent amber color. Manufacturers add pigments to the product to provide opaque paint choices of multiple colors. The color of the paint in the jar may initially look chalky, but as it dries it develops into a rich color (grey becomes black for example). Additional acrylic paints can be mixed with the liquid latex solution for custom colors but may not be suitable for use a cosmetic application.\n\nLiquid latex used for special effect make-up projects like scars and gashes incorporate flesh colored latex that is applied to the skin and then built up using materials such as tissue paper and cotton.\n\n\"Liquid latex safety guidelines\"\n"}

The USDA-ARS GRIN seed collection contains 6,200 \"Capsicum\" accessions alone, which include 4000 \"Capsicum annuum\" accessions. The other \"Capsicum\" species in the USDA germplasm repository include: \"C. chinense, C. baccatum, C. frutescens, C. pubescens, C. cardenasii, C. chacoense, C. flexuosum, C. eximium, C. rhomboideum, C. galapagoense,\" and \"C. tovarii.\" \n\nThere are five major species of cultivated \"Capsicum\", \"C. annuum, C. chinense, C. baccatum, C. frutescens, C. pubescens,\" and within those species are several \"taxonomic varieties\". Because of the ability of many of species to cross and generate inter-specific hybrids, albeit with low success, there are also what is referred to as \"complexes\" within the genus \"Capsicum\" of closely related and sexually compatible species. This includes the \"Capsicum annuum complex,\" which consists of \"C. annuum, C. frutescens,\" and \"C. chinense\".\n\nMajor species and their taxonomic varieties:\n\nThere are several different general types typically based on shape, intended use and pungency level. Some general types include:\n\nThe species and varieties include many economically important cultivars with different shapes, colors, and flavors that are grown for different purposes, such as spices, vegetables, and herbal medicines. Some confusion has resulted from the legal term \"plant variety\", which is used interchangeably with \"cultivar\" (not with \"taxonomic variety\"). The terminology around a cultivar also includes terms such as heirloom, open-pollinated, self-pollinated, and hybrid.\n\nHeirloom varieties are typically those that have been selected and grown historically with seed saved every year, and are still maintained today in similar fashion, such as the blocky-type California Wonder. Open-pollinated varieties are those that are maintained without strict barriers to prevent out-crossing and then seed is collected at and stored from each harvest such as the lamuyo-type Marconi Yellow. While open-pollinated varieties are typically true-to-type, there may be occasional out-crossing to other \"Capsicum\" varieties that may introduce some heterogeneity. Self-pollinated varieties are similar to open-pollinated varieties in that they are true-to-type and seed is collected at and stored from each harvest, but measures are taken to minimize out-crossing. This may involve placing a barrier such as a mesh bag or cage over the plant to prevent pollinators from reaching flowers, ensuring that the plant has \"selfed\". This is how much seed intended for home-garden use is produced, like the cultivar Early Jalapeño. These three types of cultivar seed production are all similar in that only one parent is used and the seed are produced generally through selfing.\n\nHybrid varieties take advantage of a phenomenon called heterosis or hybrid vigor, which occurs in pepper. To generate a hybrid variety, two self-pollinated varieties are intentionally crossed, and all seed from this cross are collected. The new hybrid variety typically is more vigorous than either of the two parents contributing to traits such as higher yield. Hybrid seed if saved will not produce a homogeneous set of plants the next generation, meaning that the two parents will need to be crossed again to generate more hybrid seed. This method is used to produce hybrid \"Capsicum\" cultivars such as the blocky-types Double-Up and Orange Blaze. Much of the commercial pepper production uses hybrid varieties for their improved traits.\n\n\"Capsicum annuum\", native from southern North America through Central America to South America, has been cultivated worldwide for over 400 years. Its forms are varied, from large to small, sweet to sour, and very hot/pungent to bland. Despite being a single species, \"C. annuum\" has many forms, with a variety of names, even in the same language. Official names aside, in American English, any variety lacking heat is colloquially known as a sweet pepper, and those sweet peppers that have a blocky-shape are referred to as bell peppers. A variety that produces capsaicin is colloquially known as a hot pepper or chili pepper. In British English, the sweet varieties are called \"peppers\" and the hot varieties \"chillies\", whereas in Australian English, the name \"capsicum\" is commonly used for bell peppers exclusively and \"chilli\" is often used to encompass the hotter varieties.\n\nThe plant is a tender perennial subshrub, with a densely branched stem. The plant reaches 0.5–1.5 m (20–60 in). Single white flowers develop into the fruit, which is typically green when unripe, but may lack chlorophyll causing a white color, changing usually to red, although some varieties may ripen to yellow, orange, peach, brown, or purple. The species are grown in temperate climates as an annual, but they are especially productive in warm and dry climates.\n\nThese have a distinctive, fruity flavor, and are commonly ground into colorful powders for use in cooking, each identified by its color.\n\n\"Capsicum chinense\" or \"Chinese capsicum\" is a misnomer since all \"Capsicum\" species originated in the New World. Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin (1727–1817), a Dutch botanist, named the species in that way in 1776 because he believed they originated in China. Most of the peppers of this species have a distinctive flavor and are similar in flavor to each other.\n\n Sometimes considered to be the same species as \"C. annuum\"\n\n\"Capsicum pubescens\" is among the oldest of domesticated peppers, and was grown as long as 5000 years ago. It is probably related to undomesticated plants that still grow in South America (\"C. cardenasii\", \"C. eximium\", and others).\n\n\n"}

She was also the mother (or sister) of Ismenus, god of the Theban river of the same name. Melia was an important cult figure at Thebes. She was worshipped at the Ismenion, the Temple of Apollo at Thebes, and was associated with a nearby spring.\n\nThe late 6th–early 5th century BC Theban poet Pindar tells us that Melia, a daughter of Oceanus, was, by Apollo, the mother of the Theban hero and prophet Tenerus. Elsewhere he refers to her as \"Melia of the golden spindle\". The 2nd century AD Greek geographer Pausanias provides a more complete account. According to Pausanias, Melia was abducted, and Melia's father Oceanus ordered his son Caanthus to find her. Caanthus found Melia at Thebes being held by Apollo, but unable to get Melia away from Apollo, Caanthus set fire to Apollo's sanctuary, and Apollo shot and killed him. Pausanius says that, in addition to Tenerus, to whom Apollo gave the \"art of divination\", Melia had another son by Apollo, Ismenus, after whom the Theban river Ismenus was named.\n\nThe story of Melia and Caanthus, as recorded by Pausainus, is a close parallel to the more famous story of Europa and Cadmus, the founder and first king of Thebes. Like Melia, Europa is abducted by an Olympian god (in this case Zeus), and her brother Cadmus is sent by their father to bring Europa back home, but like Caanthus, Cadmus is unsuccessful. As noted by Fontenrose, there are other apparent congruences between the Theban Melia and Europa. Like Melia, Europa was also the name of an Oceanid, and Agenor, the usual father of Europa, had, according to the fifth-century BC mythographer Pherecydes, a daughter named Melia who was a wife of Danaus, while, according to the mythographer Apollodrus, one of Danaos' wife's was also named Europa.\n\nThere were apparently other versions of this Theban Melia's story. In some traditions perhaps, the Thebans Melia and Ismenus were siblings, rather than mother and son. A scholiast on Pindar says that Ismenus was Melia's brother. According to the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the first fratricide occurred at Thebes when Melia's brothers, Ismenus and Claaitus (a corruption or variant of Caanthus?) fought over her.\n\nA version of Melia's story perhaps also involved the Theban Amphion. Pherecydes says that Melia was the name of one of the daughters of Amphion and his wife Niobe, while later sources tell us that Ismenus was the name of one of their sons. Like Caanthus, Amphion was shot and killed by Apollo because of an attack on his temple.\n\nThe 3rd century BC poet Callimachus appears to make this Theban Melia, rather than a daughter of Oceanus, one of the \"earth-born\" Meliae, the ash tree nymphs, who, according to Hesiod, were born, along with the Erinyes and the Giants, from Gaia (Earth) and the blood of Uranus (Sky), which dripped on Gaia when Uranus was castrated by his son Cronus.\n\nAccording to the mythographer Apollodorus, the mother of Phoroneus, and Aegialeus, by her brother, the river god Inachus, was also a daughter of Oceanus named Melia.\n\nMelia was an important object of cult worship at the Ismenion, the major sanctuary of Apollo Ismenios at Thebes. In at least three separate poems, Pindar mentions Melia in connection with the Theban sanctuary. In one he refers to the Ismenion and \"the splendid hall of Oceanus’ daughter . . . Melia\". In another, Pindar summons the local heroines, the daughters of Cadmus, Semele and Ino Leucothea, along with the mother of Heracles, to \"join Melia at the treasury of the golden tripods,\" that is in the \"adyton\", the inner inviolate sanctuary of the Ismenion where the votive tripods were dedicated.\nAlso at the Ismenion, Pindar locates the \"immortal couch [\"λέχει\"] of Melia\", the child-bed, where Melia gave birth. A spring near the Ismenion was identified with Melia, perhaps the source of the Ismenus river, and perhaps the same spring as the one mentioned by Pausanias as the spring, above the Ismenion, by which her brother Caanthus was buried.\n\nThe Thebans traced their descent from the union of Apollo and Melia, through the heroes Tenerus and Ismenus. According to Larson, while their descent from Apollo—a panhellenic Olympian god—increased their prestige, and connected them to other Greeks, their descent from Melia—a nymph associated with the local landscape—helped to establish their connection with the land that they inhabited.\n\n"}

Given the choice, she chose Heracles over Zeus who went off in search of other pursuits. She gave birth to Hercules's son Hyllus; some suggest that he was a figure distinct from Hyllus, the son of Heracles by Deianeira.\n\nHeracles tried to find refuge on the mythical island of Scheria, widely considered to be the island of Corfu in modern Greece, after the murder of his children. He decided to rest near a lake. This lake happened to be the place in which Melite and her sisters were currently residing. When Melite saw Hercules she hid him away from her siblings in a deeper and darker part of the lake where she had sex with him. The two then traveled to another part of the island and stayed there until Melite gave birth to Hyllus.\n\nZeus was in a rage over her choice of a mortal over him, and so he appealed to her father who would not let her have anymore children with Hercules or any sexual contact whatsoever. Hercules promptly left Melite for other mortals.

The entire body is yellow to yellowish brown. The dorsal segments (tergites) of the mesosoma often have longitudinal irregular stripes that are black to dark brown. They exhibit sexual dimorphism, the adult females being generally larger than males but have a lower number of pectinal teeth (16 to 23, as opposed to 22 to 28 in males).\n\nThe pedipalps of \"M. eupeus\" have a maximum of ten diagonal rows of granules on the fixed finger and eleven on the movable finger. The pedipalp chelae (pincers) are wider than the patella (segment IV). The segments of the metasoma are thick and have eight keels (octocarinate). The telson is subglobose with a flat dorsal surface.\n\n\"M. eupeus\" were first described by the German arachnologist Carl Ludwig Koch in 1839. It is classified under the genus \"Mesobuthus\" and belongs to the largest family of scorpions, the thick-tailed scorpion family Buthidae. Currently, more than 23 subspecies of \"M. eupeus\" are recognized.\n\n\"M. eupeus\" feed on small insects such as crickets or small cockroaches. Cannibalism is very rare in this species. They do not dig burrows and prefer using natural spaces and burrows under stones and other objects. They have slender pedipalps so they usually rely on their stings for killing their prey.\n\nThe venom of \"M. eupeus\" is not as potent as that of other dangerous buthid species. Victims of stings feel intense pain, hyperemia, swelling and a burning sensation in the affected area, while numbness and itching were also reported in some cases.\n\nAs in other scorpions, the venom of \"M. eupeus\" contains various neurotoxic proteins that interact specifically with ion channels. A number of unique proteins in this scorpion's venom have been identified, cloned and investigated for clinical applications. For instance, MeuKTX, structurally related to BmKTX (α-KTx3.6) from \"M. martensii\", potently inhibits rKv1.1, rKv1.2 and hKv1.3 channels but does not affect rKv1.4, rKv1.5, hKv3.1, rKv4.3, and hERG channels even at high concentrations. In contrast, BeKm-1 specifically inhibits hERG channels, which are potassium channels critical to maintaining normal electrical activities in the heart, but showed no effects on various other potassium channels tested. Inhibitors of sodium channels have also been found in this venom.\n\nA number of antimicrobial peptides have also been found in the venom of \"M. eupeus\". Meucin-13 and Meucin-18 exhibited extensive cytolytic effects on bacteria, fungi and yeasts. Furthermore, Meucin-24 and Meucin-25, first identified from genetic sequences expressed in their venom gland, were shown to selectively kill \"Plasmodium falciparum\" and inhibit the development of \"Plasmodium berghei\", both malaria parasites, but do not harm mammalian cells. These two venom-derived proteins are therefore attractive candidates for the development of anti-malarial drugs.\n\nIranian researchers have also reported that the venom of \"M. eupeus\" has anti-inflammatory properties and is effective as an anti-arthritis treatment in an experimental rat model, but the mechanism of action is unknown.\n\n\"Mesobuthus eupeus\" mostly lives in arid or semi-arid habitats with little or no vegetation.\nIts geographical distributions consists of eastern Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, southern Russia, northern Syria, eastern Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Australia, southern Mongolia and northern China.\n\n\n"}

Together with her husband Wākea (\"sky father\") Papa is the ancestor of all people and Kalo, and mother of islands as the Kanaka Maoli manifestation of Mother Earth.\n\nThe Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument was renamed in 2007 to the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, a variant form of her name.\n\nThere are many legends surrounding Papa. She is worshipped by Native Hawaiians, especially by women, as a primordial force of creation who has the power to give life and to heal. A women's temple, called Hale o Papa, is the primary religious structure associated with her worship. Hale o Papa are often built in connection with Luakini, or men's temples (places of \"official\" ceremony, which are primarily dedicated to the gods Kū and Lono), although it is believed by many practitioners that they may also exist independently. \n\nShe was the daughter of Kuaniehu who married Kahakauakoko (f). Papanuihanaumoku first married Wakea, then his brother Te Tumu, then Atea and last but not least, Rangi. Papa's husbands were the sons of Kupulanakehau (f) who married Kahiko. She was certainly not a God, her descendants from her and her husbands were the Ariki lines (High ranking Nobles, Kings) of Hawaii, Rarotonga, Aitutaki and the Maori. These lines permeated into all the Isles of Polynesia. Papa's great/great/great/great/great grandmother was Oahu, daughter of Hawaii Loa and Hualalai.\nPapanuihanaumoku, also known as Papa and Papatuanuku died in Waieri, Tahiti.\n\nAccording to legend, Papa was born in Kalihi Valley, Oʻahu and spent her early childhood there. She travelled throughout the islands, and eventually wed Wākea. Together they had a daughter, Hoohokukalani (literally, \"one who creates the stars of heaven\"). As the girl grew, Wākea fell in love with his daughter and began to have an intimate relationship with her. He tricked Papa (in some versions of the story, the institution of the kapu system was part of his scheme) in order to keep her away, so that he could seduce Hoohokukalani. When Papa discovered the truth, she was furious. However, when Hoohokukalani gave birth to a stillborn baby, it was Papa who named the child Haloa and buried him in the soft earth; from that place sprung the first kalo. Hoohokukalani again mated with her father Wākea, and had a living child, who was also named Haloa. This child became the ancestor to all Kanaka Maoli, or all humans (depending upon interpretation)..\n\nIn the Aloha ʻĀina movement, Papa is often a central figure, as her spirit is that of the life-giving, loving, forgiving earth who nurtures human life, and who is being abused by the misdeeds of mankind, especially in regard to the abuse of nature.\n\nIn 2008, Papahānaumoku and Wākea's names inspired the newly inaugurated Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "618077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=618077", "title": "Power engineering", "text": "Power engineering\n\nPower engineering, also called power systems engineering, is a subfield of electrical engineering that deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of electric power, and the electrical apparatus connected to such systems. Although much of the field is concerned with the problems of three-phase AC power – the standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world – a significant fraction of the field is concerned with the conversion between AC and DC power and the development of specialized power systems such as those used in aircraft or for electric railway networks. Power engineering draws the majority of its theoretical base from electrical engineering.\n\nElectricity became a subject of scientific interest in the late 17th century. Over the next two centuries a number of important discoveries were made including the incandescent light bulb and the voltaic pile. Probably the greatest discovery with respect to power engineering came from Michael Faraday who in 1831 discovered that a change in magnetic flux induces an electromotive force in a loop of wire—a principle known as electromagnetic induction that helps explain how generators and transformers work.\n\nIn 1881 two electricians built the world's first power station at Godalming in England. The station employed two waterwheels to produce an alternating current that was used to supply seven Siemens arc lamps at 250 volts and thirty-four incandescent lamps at 40 volts. However supply was intermittent and in 1882 Thomas Edison and his company, The Edison Electric Light Company, developed the first steam-powered electric power station on Pearl Street in New York City. The Pearl Street Station consisted of several generators and initially powered around 3,000 lamps for 59 customers. The power station used direct current and operated at a single voltage. Since the direct current power could not be easily transformed to the higher voltages necessary to minimise power loss during transmission, the possible distance between the generators and load was limited to around half-a-mile (800 m).\n\nThat same year in London Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs demonstrated the first transformer suitable for use in a real power system. The practical value of Gaulard and Gibbs' transformer was demonstrated in 1884 at Turin where the transformer was used to light up forty kilometres (25 miles) of railway from a single alternating current generator. Despite the success of the system, the pair made some fundamental mistakes. Perhaps the most serious was connecting the primaries of the transformers in series so that switching one lamp on or off would affect other lamps further down the line. Following the demonstration George Westinghouse, an American entrepreneur, imported a number of the transformers along with a Siemens generator and set his engineers to experimenting with them in the hopes of improving them for use in a commercial power system.\n\nOne of Westinghouse's engineers, William Stanley, recognised the problem with connecting transformers in series as opposed to parallel and also realised that making the iron core of a transformer a fully enclosed loop would improve the voltage regulation of the secondary winding. Using this knowledge he built the world's first practical transformer based alternating current power system at Great Barrington, Massachusetts in 1886. In 1885 the Italian physicist and electrical engineer Galileo Ferraris demonstrated an induction motor and in 1887 and 1888 the Serbian-American engineer Nikola Tesla filed a range of patents related to power systems including one for a practical two-phase induction motor which Westinghouse licensed for his AC system.\n\nBy 1890 the power industry had flourished and power companies had built thousands of power systems (both direct and alternating current) in the United States and Europe – these networks were effectively dedicated to providing electric lighting. During this time a fierce rivalry in the US known as the \"War of Currents\" emerged between Edison and Westinghouse over which form of transmission (direct or alternating current) was superior. In 1891, Westinghouse installed the first major power system that was designed to drive an electric motor and not just provide electric lighting. The installation powered a synchronous motor at Telluride, Colorado with the motor being started by a Tesla induction motor. On the other side of the Atlantic, Oskar von Miller built a 20 kV 176 km three-phase transmission line from Lauffen am Neckar to Frankfurt am Main for the Electrical Engineering Exhibition in Frankfurt. In 1895, after a protracted decision-making process, the Adams No. 1 generating station at Niagara Falls began transmitting three-phase alternating current power to Buffalo at 11 kV. Following completion of the Niagara Falls project, new power systems increasingly chose alternating current as opposed to direct current for electrical transmission.\n\nThe generation of electricity was regarded as particularly important following the Bolshevik seizure of power. Lenin stated \"Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country.\" He was subsequently featured on many Soviet posters, stamps etc. presenting this view. The GOELRO plan was initiated in 1920 as the first Bolshevik experiment in industrial planning and in which Lenin became personally involved. Gleb Krzhizhanovsky was another key figure involved, having been involved in the construction of a power station in Moscow in 1910. He had also known Lenin since 1897 when they were both in the St. Petersburg chapter of the \"Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class\".\n\nIn 1936 the first commercial high-voltage direct current (HVDC) line using mercury-arc valves was built between Schenectady and Mechanicville, New York. HVDC had previously been achieved by installing direct current generators in series (a system known as the Thury system) although this suffered from serious reliability issues. In 1957 Siemens demonstrated the first solid-state rectifier (solid-state rectifiers are now the standard for HVDC systems) however it was not until the early 1970s that this technology was used in commercial power systems. In 1959 Westinghouse demonstrated the first circuit breaker that used SF as the interrupting medium. SF is a far superior dielectric to air and, in recent times, its use has been extended to produce far more compact switching equipment (known as switchgear) and transformers. Many important developments also came from extending innovations in the ICT field to the power engineering field. For example, the development of computers meant load flow studies could be run more efficiently allowing for much better planning of power systems. Advances in information technology and telecommunication also allowed for much better remote control of the power system's switchgear and generators.\n\nPower Engineering deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of electricity as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include transformers, electric generators, electric motors and power electronics.\n\nPower engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid. These systems are called off-grid power systems and may be used in preference to on-grid systems for a variety of reasons. For example, in remote locations it may be cheaper for a mine to generate its own power rather than pay for connection to the grid and in most mobile applications connection to the grid is simply not practical.\n\nElectricity generation covers the selection, design and construction of facilities that convert energy from primary forms to electric power.\n\nElectric power transmission requires the engineering of high voltage transmission lines and substation facilities to interface to generation and distribution systems. High voltage direct current systems are one of the elements of an electric power grid.\n\nElectric power distribution engineering covers those elements of a power system from a substation to the end customer.\n\nPower system protection is the study of the ways an electrical power system can fail, and the methods to detect and mitigate for such failures.\n\nIn most projects, a power engineer must coordinate with many other disciplines such as civil and mechanical engineers, environmental experts, and legal and financial personnel. Major power system projects such as a large generating station may require scores of design professionals in addition to the power system engineers. At most levels of professional power system engineering practice, the engineer will require as much in the way of administrative and organizational skills as electrical engineering knowledge.\n\nIn both the UK and the USA, professional societies had long existed for civil and mechanical engineers. The IEE was founded in the UK in 1871, and the AIEE in the United States in 1884. These societies contributed to the exchange of electrical knowledge and the development of electrical engineering education.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3204676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3204676", "title": "Tauroctony", "text": "Tauroctony\n\nTauroctony is a modern name given to the central cult reliefs of the Roman Mithraic Mysteries. The imagery depicts Mithras killing a bull, hence the name \"tauroctony\" after the Greek word \"tauroktonos\" (\"ταυροκτόνος\", \"bull killing\"). It is distinct from the cultic slaughter of a bull in ancient Rome and known as a Taurobolium, which was mainly associated with the cult of Cybele.\n\nDespite the name, the scene is symbolic, and there is no evidence that patrons of the Roman cult ever performed such a rite. Like all Greco-Roman mysteries, the Mithraic Mysteries was limited to initiates, and there is very little known about the cult's beliefs or practices. However, several images of the bull include a \"dorsuale\" ribbon or blanket, which was a Roman convention to identify a sacrificial animal, so it is fairly certain that the killing of the bull represents a sacrificial act. And, because the main bull-killing scene is often accompanied by explicit depictions of the sun, moon, and stars, it is also fairly certain that the scene has astrological connotations. But despite dozens of theories on the subject, none has received widespread acceptance. While the basic bull-killing image appears to have been adopted from a similar depiction of Nike, and it is certain that the bull-killing symbolism and the ancillary elements together tell a story (i.e. the cult myth, the cult's \"mystery\", told only to initiates), that story has been lost and is now unknown. Following several decades of increasingly convoluted theories, Mithraic scholarship is now generally disinclined to speculation.\n\nThe tauroctony should not be confused with a \"taurobolium\", which was an actual bull-killing cult act performed by initiates of the Mysteries of Magna Mater, and has nothing to do with the Mithraic Mysteries. \"There is no evidence that [initiates of the Mithraic mysteries] ever performed such a rite [i.e. a real bull killing], and \"a priori\" considerations suggest that a mithraeum – any mithraeum – would be a most impractical place to attempt it.\"\n\nWhether as a painting or as carved monument, a depiction of the tauroctony scene belonged to the standard furniture of every mithraeum. At least one depiction would be mounted on the wall at the far end of the space where ritual activity took place, often in a niche dressed to be especially cavelike. Richly furnished mithraea, such as one in Stockstadt am Main, had multiple cult reliefs.\n\nThe scenes can be roughly divided into two groups. The \"simple\" depictions, which include just the main bull-killing scene, and the compound depictions, in which the tauroctony is the central and largest element, but which is framed by panels that portray other scenes.\n\nThe oldest known representative of the tauroctony scene is \"CIMRM\" 593/594 from Rome, a dedication of a certain Alcimus, slave steward/bailiff (\"servus vilicus\") of T. Claudius Livianus, who is identified with T. Iulius Aquilinus Castricius Saturninus Claudius Livianus, the praetorian prefect under Trajan. Like the other five earliest monuments of the Mithraic mysteries, it dates to around 100 CE.\n\nAlthough there are numerous minor variations, the basic features of the central tauroctony scene is highly uniform: Mithras half-straddles a bull that has been forced to the ground. The bull invariably appears in profile, facing to his right (the viewers’ left). In original (un-reconstructed) depictions, Mithras invariably has his head turned away from the bull, and in many he is looking back over his right shoulder up to Sol (statuary that shows Mithras looking at the bull are the result of Renaissance-era restorations of monuments that were missing a head). The bull is held down by Mithras' left leg, which is bent at an angle and the knee of which presses down on the bull's spine. The bull's rump and right hind leg is restrained by Mithras' right leg, which is almost fully extended.\n\nWith his left hand, Mithras pulls back the head of the bull by the nostrils or the muzzle (never by the horns, which – if at all represented – are short). In his right hand, Mithras usually holds a knife or short sword plunged into the neck/shoulder of the bull. Alternatively (\"CIMRM\" 2196), the knife is sticking into the bull's neck, and Mithras has his arm raised as if in triumph. Mithras is usually dressed in a knee-length long-sleeved tunic (\"tunica manicata\"), closed boots and breeches (\"anaxyrides\", \"bracae\"). Mithras' cape, if he wears one, is usually spread open, as if flying. Occasionally, Mithras is nude (\"CIMRM\" 2196, 2327; 201; 1275). On his head, Mithras usually wears a phrygian cap, like the one worn by Attis.<!--\n"}

Containing only phosphorus and nitrogen, this material is classified as a binary nitride. No applications have been developed for this material, which remains a topic of research. It is a white solid, although samples often appear colored owing to impurities.\n\nTriphosphorus pentanitride can be produced by reactions between various phosphorus(V) and nitrogen compounds (such as ammonia and sodium azide); including a reaction between the elements.\n\nSimilar methods are used to prepared boron nitride (BN) and silicon nitride (SiN); however the products are generally impure and amorphous.\n\nCrystalline samples have been produced by the reaction of ammonium chloride and hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene or phosphorus pentachloride.\n\nPN has also been prepared at room temperature, by a reaction between phosphorus trichloride and sodium amide.\n\nPN is thermally less stable than either BN or SiN, with decomposition to the elements occurring at temperatures above 850 °C:\n\nIt is resistant to weak acids and bases, and insoluble in water at room temperature, however it hydrolyzes upon heating to form the ammonium phosphate salts (NH)HPO and NHHPO.\n\nTriphosphorus pentanitride reacts with lithium nitride and calcium nitride to form the corresponding salts of PN and PN. Heterogenous ammonolyses of triphosphorus pentanitride gives imides such as HPN and HPN. It has been suggested that these compounds may have applications as solid electrolytes and pigments.\n\nSeveral different polymorphs are known for triphosphorus pentanitride. The alpha‑form of triphosphorus pentanitride (α‑PN) is encountered at atmospheric pressure and exists at pressures up to 6 GPa, at which point it converts to the gamma‑variety (γ‑PN) of the compound. Computational chemistry indicates that a third, delta‑variety (δ‑PN), will form at around 43 GPa with a Kyanite-like structure.\n\nThe structure of α‑PN has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, which showed a network structure of edge‑sharing PN tetrahedra.\n\nTriphosphorus pentanitride currently has no large scale applications although it had found use as a gettering material for incandescent lamps; replacing various mixtures containing red phosphorus in the late 1960s. The lighting filaments are dipped into a suspension of PN prior to being sealed into the bulb. After bulb closure, but whilst still on the pump, the lamps are lit, causing the PN to thermally decompose into its constituent elements. Much of this is removed by the pump but enough P vapor remains to react with any residual oxygen inside the bulb. Once the vapor pressure of P is low enough either filler gas is admitted to the bulb prior to sealing off or, if a vacuum atmosphere is desired the bulb is sealed off at that point. The high decomposition temperature of PN allows sealing machines to run faster and hotter than was possible using red phosphorus.\n\nRelated halogen containing polymers, trimeric bromophosphonitrile, (PNBr), m.p. 192 °C and tetrameric bromophosphonitrile, (PNBr), m.p. 202 °C find similar lamp gettering applications for tungsten halogen lamps, where they perform the dual processies of gettering and precise halogen dosing.\nIt has also been investigated as a new material for semiconductor based electronics; particularly as a gate insulator in metal-insulator-semiconductor devices.\n\nSeveral patents have been filed for the use of triphosphorus pentanitride in fire fighting measures.\n\n"}

A player's ranking is determined by her results at a maximum of 16 tournaments for singles and 11 for doubles and points are awarded based on how far a player advances in a tournament. The basis for calculating a player's ranking are those tournaments that yield the highest ranking points during the rolling 52-week period with the condition that they must include points from the 4 Grand Slams, the 4 Premier Mandatory tournaments and the WTA Finals. In addition, for Top 20 players, their best two results at Premier 5 tournaments will also count. Up until 2016, the WTA also distributed ranking points, for singles players only, who competed at the Summer Olympics. However, this has since been discontinued.\n\nThe points distribution for tournaments in 2017 is shown below. Points earned in 2013 were a little different in some cases and retained their value until they expired after 52 weeks.\n\n\"+H\" indicates that Hospitality is provided.\n\nIn ITF tournaments, the main draw is normally 32 for singles and 16 for doubles. Losers in the first round of doubles will receive points equal to that shown in the R32 column above. For subsequent rounds (quarter-finals onwards) the points are the same as for singles.\n\nThe following is a chronological list of players who have achieved the number one position in singles since the WTA began producing computerized rankings on November 3, 1975 (active players in green):\n\n\"Last update: 19 November 2018\"\n\nThe year-end number one player is the player at the head of the WTA rankings following the completion of the final tournament of the calendar year.\n\nThe following is a list of singles players who were ranked world No. 5 or higher but not No. 1 (active players in green):\n\n\n"}
