The caves are renowned for their karst qualities, namely the formation that has been eroded by water action that has developed from a sinkhole to become a blind valley. Several good examples of crayback formations exist in both entrances.\n\nThe reserve is situated south of and north of , near the small village of . The caves are registered as a natural heritage site on the Register of the National Estate for its large diversity of karst morphological and sedimentological features. Camping in the reserve is permitted, with sixty campground sites and two cottages. The caves are open seven days a week during school holidays; and closed on Monday and Tuesday during school terms.\n\nThe most popular feature of the Abercrombie Caves is \"The Archway\" the largest natural arch in the southern hemisphere. Within \"The Archway\" cave is the gold miners dance platform built in January 1880 by gold miners, replacing a platform built in the 1860s, the 1880s platform is still used for performances to this day including the annual Carols in the Caves performance.\n\nOther caves within the reserve are \"King Solomon's Temple\", \"Cathedral Cave\", \"Grove Cave\", and the \"Bushranger's Cave\".\n\nIt is believed that a tourist party visited the caves in 1834 but the Caves were not 'officially' discovered until 1842 by Surveyor W. R. Davidson. Surveyor Wells discovered the Koh-i-noor, Bushranger, Long Tunnel, and Cathedral caves and the Hall of Terpsichore (The Dance Hall) in 1843. Explorer William Wentworth and Governor Charles Fitzroy visited Abercrombie Caves in 1844.\n\nIt is believed that various bushrangers used the caves as a hideout during the 1800s. The earliest known is the Ribbon Gang who used the caves in 1830.\n\nGold was discovered in the area in 1854. A gold exploration community was established at Mount Gray, just above the caves. Miners from many of the surrounding communities would often visit the caves for recreation.\n\nThe caves were originally known as Burragylong Caverns and during the mining period they became known as Abercrombie caves.\n\nVandalism occurred in the early days when many pieces of white marble were carted away by the visitors as souvenirs and the miners damaged many of the formations by firing rifles at them. Some graffiti name carvings can still be seen inside the caves from the 19th century period.\n\n\n"}

The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) or snow line separates the ablation zone from the higher-altitude accumulation zone. The ablation zone often contains meltwater features such as supraglacial lakes, englacial streams, and subglacial lakes. Sediments dropped in the ablation zone forming small mounds or hillocks are called kames. Kame and kettle hole topography is useful in identifying an ablation zone of a glacier. The seasonally melting glacier deposits much sediment at its fringes in the ablation area. Ablation constitutes a key part of the glacier mass balance. \n\nThe amount of snow and ice gained in the accumulation zone and the amount of snow and ice lost in the ablation zone determine glacier mass balance. Often mass balance measurements are made in the ablation zone using snow stakes. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "30543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30543", "title": "Alhambra", "text": "Alhambra\n\nThe Alhambra (; ; , \"Al-Ḥamrāʾ\", lit. \"The Red One\", the complete Arabic form of which was \"Qalat Al-Hamra\") is a palace and fortress complex located in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. It was originally constructed as a small fortress in AD 889 on the remains of Roman fortifications, and then largely ignored until its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its current palace and walls. It was converted into a royal palace in 1333 by Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada. After the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered in the Renaissance style. In 1526 Charles I & V commissioned a new Renaissance palace better befitting the Holy Roman Emperor in the revolutionary Mannerist style influenced by humanist philosophy in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid Andalusian architecture, but it was ultimately never completed due to Morisco rebellions in Granada.\n\nAlhambra's last flowering of Islamic palaces were built for the last Muslim emirs in Spain during the decline of the Nasrid dynasty, who were increasingly subject to the Christian Kings of Castile. After being allowed to fall into disrepair for centuries, the buildings occupied by squatters, Alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of Napoleon, who had conducted retaliatory destruction of the site. The rediscoverers were first British intellectuals and then other north European Romantic travelers. It is now one of Spain's major tourist attractions, exhibiting the country's most significant and well-known Islamic architecture, together with 16th-century and later Christian building and garden interventions. The Alhambra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the inspiration for many songs and stories.\n\nMoorish poets described it as \"a pearl set in emeralds\", an allusion to the colour of its buildings and the woods around them. The palace complex was designed with the mountainous site in mind and many forms of technology were considered. The park (Alameda de la Alhambra), which is overgrown with wildflowers and grass in the spring, was planted by the Moors with roses, oranges, and myrtles; its most characteristic feature, however, is the dense wood of English elms brought by the Duke of Wellington in 1812. The park has a multitude of nightingales and is usually filled with the sound of running water from several fountains and cascades. These are supplied through a conduit long, which is connected with the Darro at the monastery of Jesus del Valle above Granada.\n\nDespite long neglect, willful vandalism, and some ill-judged restoration, the Alhambra endures as an atypical example of Muslim art in its final European stages, relatively uninfluenced by the direct Byzantine influences found in the Mezquita of Córdoba. The majority of the palace buildings are quadrangular in plan, with all the rooms opening on to a central court, and the whole reached its present size simply by the gradual addition of new quadrangles, designed on the same principle, though varying in dimensions, and connected with each other by smaller rooms and passages. Alhambra was extended by the different Muslim rulers who lived in the complex. However, each new section that was added followed the consistent theme of \"paradise on earth\". Column arcades, fountains with running water, and reflecting pools were used to add to the aesthetic and functional complexity. In every case, the exterior was left plain and austere. Sun and wind were freely admitted. Blue, red, and a golden yellow, all somewhat faded through lapse of time and exposure, are the colors chiefly employed.\n\nThe decoration consists for the upper part of the walls, as a rule, of Arabic inscriptions—mostly poems by Ibn Zamrak and others praising the palace—that are manipulated into geometrical patterns with vegetal background set onto an arabesque setting (\"Ataurique\"). Much of this ornament is carved stucco (plaster) rather than stone. Tile mosaics (\"alicatado\"), with complicated mathematical patterns (\"tracería\", most precisely \"lacería\"), are largely used as panelling for the lower part. Similar designs are displayed on wooden ceilings (Alfarje). Muqarnas are the main elements for vaulting with stucco, and some of the most accomplished dome examples of this kind are in the Court of the Lions halls. The palace complex is designed in the Nasrid style, the last blooming of Islamic Art in the Iberian Peninsula, that had a great influence on the Maghreb to the present day, and on contemporary Mudejar Art, which is characteristic of western elements reinterpreted into Islamic forms and widely popular during the Reconquista in Spain.\n\nCompleted towards the end of Muslim rule of Spain by Yusuf I (1333–1353) and Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada (1353–1391), the Alhambra is a reflection of the culture of the last centuries of the Moorish rule of Al Andalus, reduced to the Nasrid Emirate of Granada. It is a place where artists and intellectuals had taken refuge as the Reconquista by Spanish Christians won victories over Al Andalus. The Alhambra integrates natural site qualities with constructed structures and gardens, and is a testament to Moorish culture in Spain and the skills of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian artisans, craftsmen, and builders of their era.\n\nThe literal translation of Alhambra, \"the red (female),\" reflects the color of the red clay of the surroundings of which the fort is made. The buildings of the Alhambra were originally whitewashed; however, the buildings as seen today are reddish. Another possible origin of the name is the tribal designation of the Nasrid Dynasty, known as the Banu al-Ahmar \"Arabic: Sons of the Red (male)\", a sub-tribe of the Arab Qahtanite Banu Khazraj tribe. One of the early Nasrid ancestors was nicknamed \"Yusuf Al Ahmar\" (Yusuf the Red) and hence the (Nasrid) fraction of the Banu Khazraj took up the name of Banu al-Ahmar.\n\nThe first reference to the Qal‘at al-Ḥamra was during the battles between the Arabs and the Muladies (people of mixed Arab and European descent) during the rule of the ‘Abdullah ibn Muhammad (r. 888–912). In one particularly fierce and bloody skirmish, the Muladies soundly defeated the Arabs, who were then forced to take shelter in a primitive red castle located in the province of Elvira, presently located in Granada. According to surviving documents from the era, the red castle was quite small, and its walls were not capable of deterring an army intent on conquering. The castle was then largely ignored until the eleventh century, when its ruins were renovated and rebuilt by Samuel ibn Naghrela, vizier to the emir Badis ben Habus of the Zirid Dynasty of Al Andalus, in an attempt to preserve the small Jewish settlement also located on the natural plateau, Sabikah Hill.\n\nIbn Nasr, the founder of the Nasrid Dynasty, was forced to flee to Jaén to avoid persecution by King Ferdinand III of Castile and the Reconquista supporters working to end Spain's Moorish rule. After retreating to Granada, Ibn-Nasr took up residence at the Palace of Badis ben Habus in the Alhambra. A few months later, he embarked on the construction of a new Alhambra fit for the residence of a sultan. According to an Arabic manuscript since published as the \"Anónimo de Granada y Copenhague\",\n\nThe design included plans for six palaces, five of which were grouped in the northeast quadrant forming a royal quarter, two circuit towers, and numerous bathhouses. During the reign of the Nasrid Dynasty, the Alhambra was transformed into a palatine city, complete with an irrigation system composed of acequias for the gardens of the Generalife located outside the fortress. Previously, the old Alhambra structure had been dependent upon rainwater collected from a cistern and from what could be brought up from the Albaicín. The creation of the Sultan's Canal solidified the identity of the Alhambra as a palace-city rather than a defensive and ascetic structure. The hydraulic system includes two long water channels and several sophisticated elevation devices to bring water onto the plateau.\n\nThe last Nasrid sultan, Muhammad XII of Granada, surrendered the Emirate of Granada in 1492 without the Alhambra itself being attacked when the forces of the Reyes Católicos, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, took the surrounding territory with a force of overwhelming numbers.\n\nThe decoration within the palaces comes from the last great period of Andalusian art in Granada. With little of the Byzantine influence of contemporary Abassid architecture, artists endlessly reproduced the same forms and trends, creating a new style that developed over the course of the Nasrid Dynasty. The Nasrids used freely all the stylistic elements that had been created and developed during eight centuries of Muslim rule in the Peninsula, including the Caliphate horseshoe arch, the Almohad sebka (a grid of rhombuses), the Almoravid palm, and unique combinations of them, as well as innovations such as stilted arches and muqarnas (stalactite ceiling decorations). Structurally, the design is simple and does not evince significant innovation. While artistically pleasing it was until the reconquest structurally ad hoc and reliant on the skills of subject artisans and workers.\n\nColumns and muqarnas appear in several chambers, and the interiors of numerous palaces are decorated with arabesques and calligraphy. The arabesques of the interior are ascribed to, among other sultans, Yusuf I, Mohammed V, and Ismail I, Sultan of Granada.\n\nAfter the Christian conquest of the city in 1492, the conquerors began to alter the Alhambra. The open work was filled up with whitewash, the painting and gilding effaced, and the furniture soiled, torn, or removed. Charles I (1516–1556) rebuilt portions in the Renaissance style of the period and destroyed the greater part of the winter palace to make room for a Renaissance-style structure which was never completed. Philip V (1700–1746) Italianised the rooms and completed his palace in the middle of what had been the Moorish building; he had partitions constructed which blocked up whole apartments.\n\nOver subsequent centuries the Moorish art was further damaged, and in 1812 some of the towers were destroyed by the French under Count Sebastiani. In 1821, an earthquake caused further damage. Restoration work was undertaken in 1828 by the architect José Contreras, endowed in 1830 by Ferdinand VII. After the death of Contreras in 1847, it was continued by his son Rafael (died 1890) and his grandson. Especially notable was the intervention of in the 1930s: the young architect \"opened arcades that had been walled up, re-excavated filled-in pools, replaced missing tiles, completed inscriptions that lacked portions of their stuccoed lettering, and installed a ceiling in the still unfinished palace of Charles V\".\n\nAccording to the site's current architect, Pedro Salmeron Escobar, the Alhambra evolved organically over a period of several centuries from the ancient hilltop fortress defined by a narrow promontory carved by the river Daro and overlooking the \"Vega\" or Plain of Granada as it descends from the Sierra Nevada. The red earth from which the fortress is constructed is a granular aggregate held together by a medium of red clay which gives the resulting layered brick- and stone- reinforced construction (\"tapial calicastrado\") its characteristic hue and is at the root of the name of 'the Red Hill'.\n\nThis crude earthiness is counterpointed by the startling fine alabaster white stucco work of the famous interiors. Meltwater from the 'Snowy Mountains' is drawn across an arched vault at the eastern tip of the \"Torre del Agua\" ('Water Tower') and channeled through the citadel via a complex system of conduits (\"acequia\") and water tanks (\"los albercones\") which create the celebrated interplay of light, sound and surface.\n\nAlhambra is about in length by at its greatest width. It extends from west-northwest to east-southeast and covers an area of about or 35 acres. The Alhambra's most westerly feature is the Alcazaba (citadel), a strongly fortified position built to protect the original post-Roman districts of \"Iliberri\", now 'Centro', and \"Gárnata al-yahūd\" ('Granada of the Jews', now \"Realejo\", and the Moorish suburb of \"El Albayzín\".\n\nDue to touristic demand, modern access runs contrary to the original sequence which began from a principal access via the \"Puerta de la Justicia\" (Gate of Justice) onto a large souq or public market square facing the Alcazaba, now subdivided and obscured by later Christian-era development. From the \"Puerta del Vino\" (Wine Gate) ran the \"Calle Real\" (Royal Street) dividing the Alhambra along its axial spine into a southern residential quarter, with mosques, hamams (bathhouses) and diverse functional establishments, and a greater northern portion, occupied by several palaces of the nobility with extensive landscaped gardens commanding views over the Albayzin. All of this was subservient to the great Tower of the Ambassadors in the \"Palacio Comares\", which acted as the royal audience chamber and throne room with its three arched windows dominating the city. The private, internalised universe of the \"Palacio de Los Leones\" (Palace of the Lions) adjoins the public spaces at right angles (see Plan illustration) but was originally connected only by the function of the Royal Baths, the Eye of Aixa's Room serving as the exquisitely decorated focus of meditation and authority overlooking the refined garden of \"Lindaraja/Daraxa\" toward the city.\n\nThe rest of the plateau comprises a number of earlier and later Moorish palaces, enclosed by a fortified wall, with thirteen defensive towers, some such as the \"Torres de la Infanta\" and \"Cattiva\" containing elaborate vertical palaces in miniature. The river Darro passes through a ravine on the north and divides the plateau from the Albaicín district of Granada. Similarly, the Assabica Valley, containing the Alhambra Park, lies on the west and south, and, beyond this valley, the almost parallel ridge of Monte Mauror separates it from the Antequeruela district. Another ravine separates it from the Generalife, the summer pleasure gardens of the emir. Escobar notes that the later planting of deciduous elms obscures the overall perception of the layout, so a better reading of the original landscape is given in winter when the trees are bare.\n\nThe Alhambra resembles many medieval Christian strongholds in its threefold arrangement as a castle, a palace and a residential annex for subordinates. The alcazaba or citadel, its oldest part, is built on the isolated and precipitous foreland which terminates the plateau on the northwest. All that remains are its massive outer walls, towers and ramparts. On its watchtower, the 25 m (85 ft) high \"Torre de la Vela\", the flag of Ferdinand and Isabella was first raised as a symbol of the Spanish conquest of Granada on 2 January 1492. A turret containing a large bell was added in the 18th century and restored after being damaged by lightning in 1881. Beyond the Alcazaba is the palace of the Moorish rulers, The Nasrid Palaces or Alhambra proper, and beyond this is the Alhambra Alta (Upper Alhambra), originally occupied by officials and courtiers.\n\nAccess from the city to the Alhambra Park is afforded by the \"Puerta de las Granadas\" (Gate of Pomegranates), a triumphal arch dating from the 15th century. A steep ascent leads past the Pillar of Charles V, a fountain erected in 1554, to the main entrance of the Alhambra. This is the \"Puerta de la Justicia\" (Gate of Justice), a massive horseshoe archway surmounted by a square tower and used by the Moors as an informal court of justice. The hand of Fatima, with fingers outstretched as a talisman against the evil eye, is carved above this gate on the exterior; a key, the symbol of authority, occupies the corresponding place on the interior. A narrow passage leads inward to the \"Plaza de los Aljibes\" (Place of the Cisterns), a broad open space which divides the Alcazaba from the Moorish palace. To the left of the passage rises the \"Torre del Vino\" (Wine Tower), built in 1345 and used in the 16th century as a cellar. On the right is the palace of Charles V, a smaller Renaissance building, to construct which part of the Alhambra, including the original main entrance, was torn down.\n\nThe Royal Complex (Plaza de Nazaríes) consists of three main parts: Mexuar, Serallo, and the Harem. The Mexuar is modest in decor and houses the functional areas for conducting business and administration. Strapwork is used to decorate the surfaces in Mexuar. The ceilings, floors, and trim are made of dark wood and are in sharp contrast to white, plaster walls. Serallo, built during the reign of Yusuf I in the 14th century, contains the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles). Brightly colored interiors featured \"dado\" panels, \"yesería\", \"azulejo\", cedar, and \"artesonado\". Artesonado are highly decorative ceilings and other woodwork. Lastly, the Harem is also elaborately decorated and contains the living quarters for the wives and mistresses of the Arab monarchs. This area contains a bathroom with running water (cold and hot), baths, and pressurized water for showering. The bathrooms were open to the elements in order to allow in light and air.\n\nThe present entrance to the \"Palacio Árabe\" (Arab palace), or \"Casa Real\", is by a small door from which a corridor connects to the \"Patio de los Arrayanes\" (Court of the Myrtles), also called the \"Patio de la Alberca\" (Court of the Blessing or Court of the Pond), from the Arabic \"birka\", \"pool\". The birka helped to cool the palace and acted as a symbol of power. Because water was usually in short supply, the technology required to keep these pools full was expensive and difficult. This court is 42 m (140 ft) long by 22 m (74 ft) broad, and in the centre there is a large pond set in the marble pavement, full of goldfish, and with myrtles growing along its sides. There are galleries on the north and south sides; the southern gallery is 7 m (23 ft) high and supported by a marble colonnade. Underneath it, to the right, was the principal entrance, and over it are three windows with arches and miniature pillars. From this court, the walls of the \"Torre de Comares\" are seen rising over the roof to the north and reflected in the pond.\n\nThe \"Salón de los Embajadores\" (Hall of the Ambassadors) is the largest room in the Alhambra and occupies all the \"Torre de Comares\". It is a square room, the sides being 12 m (37 ft) in length, while the centre of the dome is 23 m (75 ft) high. This was the grand reception room, and the throne of the sultan was placed opposite the entrance. The grand hall projects from the walls of the palace, providing views in three directions. In this sense, it was a \"mirador\" from which the palace's inhabitants could gaze outward to the surrounding landscape. The tiles are nearly 4 ft (1.2 m) high all round, and the colours vary at intervals. Over them is a series of oval medallions with inscriptions, interwoven with flowers and leaves. There are nine windows, three on each facade, and the ceiling is decorated with white, blue and gold inlays in the shape of circles, crowns and stars. The walls are covered with varied stucco works, surrounding many ancient escutcheons.\n\nThe Court of the Lions (\"Patio de los Leones\") is an oblong courtyard, 116 ft (35 m) in length by 66 ft (20 m) in width, surrounded by a low gallery supported on 124 white marble columns. A pavilion projects into the court at each extremity, with filigree walls and a light domed roof. The square is paved with coloured tiles and the colonnade with white marble, while the walls are covered 5 ft (1.5 m) up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, with a border above and below of enamelled blue and gold. The columns supporting the roof and gallery are irregularly placed. They are adorned by varieties of foliage, etc.; about each arch there is a large square of stucco arabesques; and over the pillars is another stucco square of filigree work.\n\nIn the centre of the court is the Fountain of the Lions, an alabaster basin supported by the figures of twelve lions in white marble, not designed with sculptural accuracy but as symbols of strength, power, and sovereignty. Each hour one lion would produce water from its mouth. At the edge of the great fountain there is a poem written by Ibn Zamrak. This praises the beauty of the fountain and the power of the lions, but it also describes their ingenious hydraulic systems and how they actually worked, which baffled all those who saw them.\n\nThe \"Sala de los Abencerrajes\" (Hall of the Abencerrages) derives its name from a legend according to which the father of Boabdil, the last sultan of Granada, having invited the chiefs of that line to a banquet, massacred them here. This room is a perfect square, with a lofty dome and trellised windows at its base. The roof is decorated in blue, brown, red and gold, and the columns supporting it spring out into the arch form in a remarkably beautiful manner. Opposite to this hall is the \"Sala de las dos Hermanas\" (Hall of the two Sisters), so-called from two white marble slabs laid as part of the pavement. These slabs measure 500 by 220 cm (15 by 7½ ft). There is a fountain in the middle of this hall, and the roof — a dome honeycombed with tiny cells, all different, and said to number 5000 — is an example of the \"stalactite vaulting\" of the Moors.\n\nOf the outlying buildings connected to the Alhambra, the foremost in interest is the Palacio de Generalife or Gineralife (the Muslim \"Jennat al Arif\", \"Garden of Arif,\" or \"Garden of the Architect\"). This villa dates from the beginning of the 14th century but has been restored several times. The \"Villa de los Martires\" (Martyrs' Villa), on the summit of Monte Mauror, commemorates by its name the Christian slaves who were forced to build the Alhambra and confined here in subterranean cells. The \"Torres Bermejas\" (Vermilion Towers), also on Monte Mauror, are a well-preserved Moorish fortification, with underground cisterns, stables, and accommodation for a garrison of 200 men. Several Roman tombs were discovered in 1829 and 1857 at the base of Monte Mauror.\n\nAmong the other features of the Alhambra are the \"Sala de la Justicia\" (Hall of Justice), the \"Patio del Mexuar\" (Court of the Council Chamber), the \"Patio de Daraxa\" (Court of the Vestibule), and the \"Peinador de la Reina\" (Queen's Robing Room), in which there is similar architecture and decoration. The palace and the Upper Alhambra also contain baths, rows of bedrooms and summer-rooms, a whispering gallery and labyrinth, and vaulted sepulchres.\n\nThe original furniture of the palace is represented by one of the famous Alhambra vases, very large Hispano-Moresque ware vases made in the Sultanate to stand in niches around the palace. These famous examples of Hispano-Moresque ware date from the 14th and 15th centuries. The one remaining in the palace, from about 1400, is 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) high; the background is white and the decoration is blue, white and gold.\n\nParts of the following works are set in the Alhambra:\n\nThe plot of the \"Ballet-héroïque\" entitled \"Zaïde, Reine De Grenade\", by the French Baroque composer Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer (c. 1705–1755), takes place at the Alhambra. Alhambra has directly inspired musical compositions as Francisco Tárrega's famous tremolo study for guitar \"Recuerdos De La Alhambra\". Claude Debussy's piece for two pianos composed in 1901, \"Lindaraja\", and the prelude, \"La Puerta Del Vino\", from the second book of preludes composed from 1912 to 1913. Isaac Albéniz wrote a piano suite \"Recuerdos De viaje\", which included a piece called \"En La Alhambra\", while his suite Iberia contained a piece called \"El Albacin\". Albéniz also composed a \"Suite Alhambra\", but was uncompleted.\n\"En Los Jardines Del Generalife\", the first movement of Manuel de Falla's \"Noches En Los Jardines De España\", and other pieces by composers such as Ruperto Chapí (\"Los Gnomos De La Alhambra\", 1891), Tomás Bretón, and many others are included in a stream referred to by scholars as \"Alhambrismo\".\n\nIn 1976, filmmaker Christopher Nupen filmed \"The Song Of The Guitar\" at the Alhambra which was an hour-long program featuring the legendary Spanish guitarist, Andrés Segovia. British composer Julian Anderson wrote an orchestral piece, \"Alhambra Fantasy\".\n\nIn pop and folk music, Alhambra is the subject of the Ghymes song of the same name. The rock band The Grateful Dead released a song called \"Terrapin Station\" on the 1977 album of the same name. It consisted of a series of small compositions penned by Robert Hunter and put to music by Jerry Garcia; a lyrical section of this suite was called \"Alhambra\". In September 2006, Canadian singer/composer Loreena McKennitt performed live at the Alhambra. The resulting video recordings premiered on PBS and were later released as a 3-disc DVD/CD set called \"Nights From The Alhambra\". The Basque pop group Mocedades performed a song called \"Juntos En La Alhambra\". \"Alhambra\" is the title of an EP recording by Canadian rock band, The Tea Party, containing acoustic versions of a few of their songs. Alhambra and Albaicín are mentioned in the Mago de Oz song named \"El Paseo De Los Tristes\" from the album entitled \"Gaia II\". On California rapper Dom Kennedy's 2015 album \"By Dom Kennedy\", there is a song entitled \"Alhambra\".\n\nThe Alhambra tiles are remarkable in that they contain nearly all, if not all, of the seventeen mathematically possible wallpaper groups. This is a unique accomplishment in world architecture. M. C. Escher's visit in 1922 and study of the Moorish use of symmetries in the Alhambra tiles inspired his subsequent work on tessellation, which he called \"regular divisions of the plane\".\n\nMarcel L'Herbier's 1921 film \"El Dorado\" features many scenes shot in and around the Alhambra palace. This was the first time permission had been granted for a feature film company to shoot inside the Alhambra palace and L'Herbier gave prominent place to its gardens, fountains and geometric architectural patterns, which became some of the film's most memorable images.\n\nAnimated films by Spanish director Juan Bautista Berasategui such as \"Ahmed, El Principe De La Alhambra\" and \"El Embrujo Del Sur\" are based on stories in Washington Irving's \"Tales of the Alhambra\".\n\nThe Court of the Lions was depicted in \"Assassin's Creed\" (2016) when Sultan Muhammad XII surrenders the 'Apple of Eden', a powerful artifact in the center of the movie plot, in exchange for his son's safe return. Both the Court of the Lions and Granada's Albaicin are featured on The animated film .\n\nThe fictional Broadway theatre (the interior actually Auckland, New Zealand's Civic Theatre), in which Kong is displayed as the 'Eighth Wonder of the World' in 2005's \"King Kong\", is named \"The Alhambra\".\n\n\n\nThere is a main belt asteroid named Alhambra.\n\nThe Alhambra inspired the synagogue Isaac M. Wise Temple.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10280388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10280388", "title": "Animals in Islam", "text": "Animals in Islam\n\nIn Islam, God is in a relationship with animals: according to the Qur'an, they praise him, even if this praise is not expressed in human language. Baiting animals for entertainment or gambling is prohibited.\n\nThe Quran explicitly allows the eating of the meat of certain \"halal\" (, lawful) animals. Although some Sufis have practised vegetarianism, there has been no serious discourse on the possibility of vegetarian interpretations. Certain animals can be eaten under the condition that they are slaughtered in a specified way. \"Stunning cannot be used to kill an animal, according to the Halal Food Authority (HFA), a non-profit organisation that monitors adherence to halal principles. But it can be used if the animal survives and is then killed by halal methods, the HFA adds,\" reports the BBC. Prohibitions include swine, carrion, and animals involved in \"dhabihah\" (, ritual slaughter) in the name of someone other than God. The Quran also states \"eat of that over which the name of Allah, hath been mentioned.\" \n\nIn pre-Islamic Arabia, Arab Bedouin, like other people, attributed the qualities and the faults of humans to animals. Generosity, for example, was attributed to the cock; perfidy to the lizard; stupidity to the bustard; and boldness to the lion.\n\nBased on the facts that the names of certain tribes bear the names of animals, survivals of animal cults, prohibitions of certain foods and other indications, W.  R. Smith argued for the practice of totemism by certain tribes of Arabia. Others have argued that this evidence may only imply practice of a form of animalism. In support of this, for example, it was believed that upon one's death, the soul departs from the body in the form of a bird (usually a sort of owl); the soul-as-bird then flies about the tomb for some time, occasionally crying out (for vengeance).\n\nAccording to Islam, human beings are allowed to use animals, but only if their rights are respected. The owner of an animal must do everything they can to benefit the animal. If the owner fails to perform their duties for the animal, nobody else has the right to use them. The duties humans have for animals in Islam are based on the Quran, Sunnah and traditions.\n\nFrom the Islamic perspective, animal protection is more important than the fulfillment of certain religious obligations in special circumstances.\n\nHarming, disabling, injuring, or cutting out the organs from any animal is prohibited. Islam strongly warns people against committing such an act.\nMuslims may not cut the forelock, mane, or tail of a horse, because it is believed there is goodness in its forelock; its mane provides it warmth; and it swats insects away with its tail.\n\nMuslims are not allowed to commit some acts like castration and interbreeding animals. Muhammad forbade people from castrating animals.\n\nFrom the Muslim perspective, Muslims are not allowed to harass and misuse animals, which even includes actions like snatching a leaf from an ant's mouth. Muslims have no right to brand animals, even in the war they will not be hamstringing or crucifying animals before killing and burning them even though they cause harm to human. They should not be harassed to obtain animal meat by doing things like swift and powerful slaughter, avoid cutting lengthwise for fast die or must be refused anything that causes interval between slaughtering and final death. In Islamic slaughter, one is not authorized to break the spinal cord by cutting its head or breaking its backbone, and even removing wool from animals is not allowed because it causes them vulnerability.\n\nIn Islam, Muslims are not allowed to use any equipment that damages the animal, (for example, beating them in a circus show, forcing them to carry heavy loads, or making them run at extreme speeds in races) even to train them. Instead, it should use methods such as sensitization to specific sounds.\n\nMuslims are obliged to provide food and water for any thirsty or hungry animal they see, even if the animal does not belong to them. In providing food and water it should be noted a few points: 1)The quality of the Provisions. 2) The Provision rate: in this case, it should be noted the animal's condition (pregnancy, illness, working, etc.) and the place of the animal.\n\nAnimals' health must be respected in itself, its food and water, its place of living.\n\nIn the event an animal falls ill, Muslims are expected to pay for the care and medication.\n\nFrom an Islamic view, the appropriate place for animal life should have three characteristics: 1) Fits the animal situation: they should not be placed in a dirty and bad condition on the pretext that they do not understand. 2) Fits the physical needs of the animal: the place should be in such a way so as to keep the animal healthy and protect it from cold and heat. 3) The dwelling of animals should not cause pollution of the environment or disease of other organisms.\n\nIn Islam, the privacy of animals is respected as of humans. Respect to animals is not limited to their living time, but after death, it is also not right to disrespect their bodies for malicious purposes.\n\nAlthough over two hundred verses in the Qur'an deal with animals and six \"sura\" (chapteral divisions) of the Qur'an are named after animals, animal life is not a predominant theme in the Qur'an; \"hayawān\"/\"haywān\" (; plural \"haywānāt\"), the Arabic word meaning \"animal\" appears only once in the Qur'an but in the sense of everlasting life (personal). On the other hand, the term \"dābba\" (; plural \"dawābb\"), usually translated as \"beast\" or \"creature\" to sometimes differentiate from flying birds while surprisingly including humans, occurs a number of times in the Qur'an, while remaining rare in medieval Arabic works on zoology. Animals in the Qur'an and early Muslim thought may usually (though not necessarily) be seen in terms of their relation to human beings, producing a tendency toward anthropocentrism. \n\nThe Qur'an teaches that God created animals from water. God cares for all his creatures and provides for them. All creation praises God, even if this praise is not expressed in human language. God has prescribed laws for each species (laws of nature). Since animals follow the laws God has ordained for them, they are to be regarded as \"Muslim\", just as a human who obeys the laws prescribed for humans (Islamic law) is a Muslim. Just like humans, animals form \"communities\". In verse , the Qur'an applies the term \"ummah\", generally used to mean \"a human religious community\", for genera of animals. The \"Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an\" states that this verse has been \"far reaching in its moral and ecological implications.\"\n\nThe Qur'an says that animals benefit humans in many ways and that they are aesthetically pleasing to look at. This is used a proof of God's benevolence towards humans. Animals that are slaughtered in accordance with sharia may be consumed. According to many verses of the Qur'an, the consumption of pork is sinful, unless there is no alternative other than starving to death (in times, for example, of war or famine).\n\"Surat Yusuf\" of the Quran mentions that a reason why Ya‘qub was reluctant to let his son Yusuf to play in the open, even in the presence of his brothers, was that a wolf could eat him.\n\nThe Quran contains three mentions of dogs: \n\nHunting dogs and the dog of the Companions of \"al-Kahf\" (, the Cave) are described in a positive light, and the companionship of these dogs is mentioned with approval. The Qurʼan, thus, contains not even a hint of the condemnation of dogs found in certain \"Hadith\".\nThere is a whole chapter in the Quran naming \"The Ants\". In Sunni Islam killing of Ants is prohibited.\nThe Quran talks about a miraculous \"She-Camel of God\" (, 'she-camel') that came from stone, in the context of the Prophet Salih, Thamudi people and Al-Hijr.\n\nPork is \"haram\" (, forbidden) to eat, because its essence is considered impure, this is based on the verse of the Qur'an where it is described as being \"rijs\" (, impure) ().\n\nVerses 50 and 51 of \"Surat al-Muddaththir\" in the Quran talk about \"ḥumur\" (, 'asses' or 'donkeys') fleeing from a \"qaswarah\" (, 'lion', 'beast of prey' or 'hunter'), in its criticism of people who were averse to Muhammad's teachings, such as donating wealth to the less wealthy.\n\n\"Sunnah\" refers to the traditional biographies of Muhammad wherein examples of sayings attributed to him and his conduct have been recorded. Sunni and Shi'a \"hadith\" (anecdotes about Muhammad) differ vastly, with Shi'a \"hadith\" generally containing more anthropomorphism and praise of animals.\n\nAnimals must not be mutilated while they are alive.\n\nMuhammad is also reported (by Ibn Omar and Abdallah bin Al-As) to have said: \"there is no man who kills [even] a sparrow or anything smaller, without its deserving it, but God will question him about it [on the judgment day]\" and \"Whoever is kind to the creatures of God is kind to himself.\"\n\nMuhammad issued advice to kill animals that were \"Fasiq\" ( \"Harmful ones\"), such as the rat and the scorpion, within the holy area \"haram\" (, holy area) of Mecca. Killing other non-domesticated animals in this area, such as zebras and birds, is forbidden.\n\nThere is an account in the Qur'an's \"sura\" an-Naml of Sulaymaan (Solomon) talking to ants. and birds.\n\nMuslims are required to sharpen the blade when slaughtering animals to ensure that no pain is felt. Muhammad is said: \"For [charity showed to] each creature which has a wet liver [i.e. is alive], there is a reward.\"\n\nThere is a \"hadith\" in Muwatta’ Imam Malik about Muslim Pilgrims having to beware of the wolf, besides other animals.\n\nIbn Mughaffal reported: \"The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ordered the killing of rabid dogs, and then said: What about them, i. e. about other dogs? and then granted concession (to keep) the dog for hunting and the dog for (the security) of the herd, and said: When the dog licks the utensil, wash it seven times, and rub it with earth the eighth time.\" (From Muslim Book #002, Hadith #0551)\n\nIbn 'Umar reported \"Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) giving the command for killing dogs...\" (From Muslim Book #010, Hadith #3809)\n\nSome Muslim commentators (e.g. Bassam Zawadi) suggest however that these killings were to be limited to \"rabid dogs\".\nprimary source\nThe majority of Muslim jurists consider dogs to be ritually unclean, though jurists from the Sunni Maliki school disagree. However, outside their ritual uncleanness, Islamic \"Fatwā\", or rulings, enjoin that dogs be treated kindly or else be freed. Muslims generally cast dogs in a negative light because of their ritual impurity. the story of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus in the Qur'an (and also the role of the dog in early Christianity) is one of the striking exceptions. though dogs are not recommended as pets, they are allowed to be kept, especially if used for work and protection, such as guarding the house or farm, or when used for hunting purposes.\nMuhammad, the messenger of Allah (God) in Islam, is also reported as having reprimanded some men who were sitting idly on their camels in a marketplace, saying \"either ride them or leave them alone\". Apart from that, the camel has significance in Islam.\nAl-Qaswa' () was a female Arabian camel that belonged to Muhammad, and was dear to him. Muhammad rode on Qaswa during the \"Hegira\" (, 'Migration') from Mecca to Medina, his Hajj in 629 CE, and the Conquest of Mecca in 630. The camel was also present during the Battle of Badr in 624. After the passing away of the Prophet, the Camel is reported to have starved itself to death, refusing to take food from anyone.\n\nIn the \"Nahj al-Balagha\", the Shi'a book of the sayings of Ali, an entire sermon is dedicated to praising peacocks.\nBees are highly revered in Islam. The structural genius of a bee is thought as due to divine inspiration. Their product honey is also revered as medicine. Killing a bee is considered a great sin.\n\nIn Shi'ite \"ahadith\", bats are praised as a miracle of nature.\n\nThe \"dhi’b\" (, wolf) may symbolize ferocity. As for the \"kalb\" (, dog), there are different views regarding it. Some schools of Islamic law consider dogs as unclean (\"najis\"), while others, such as the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence distinguishes between wild dogs and pet dogs, only considering the saliva of the former to be impure.\n\nAccording to the Qur'an, the use of hunting dogs is permitted, which is a reason the Maliki school draws a distinction between feral and domesticated dogs―since Muslims can eat game that has been caught in a domesticated dog's mouth, the saliva of a domesticated dog cannot be impure. Abou El Fadl \"found it hard to believe that the same God who created such companionable creatures would have his prophet declare them 'unclean, stating that animosity towards dogs \"reflected views far more consistent with pre-Islamic Arab customs and attitudes\". Furthermore, \"he found that a hadith from one of the most trustworthy sources tells how the Prophet himself had prayed in the presence of his playfully cavorting dogs.\" Islamic scholar Ingrid Mattson teaches that for followers of other schools, \"there are many other impurities present in our homes, mostly in the form of human waste, blood, and other bodily fluids\" and that since it is common for these impurities to come in contact with a Muslim's clothes, they are simply washed or changed before prayer. The Qur'an (18:18) praises a group of dogs that guarded Muslims who were fleeing religious persecution. Mattson thus notes that \"This tender description of the dog guarding the cave makes it clear that the animal is good company for believers.\"\n\nThe historian William Montgomery Watt states that Muhammad's kindness to animals was remarkable; he cites an instance of Muhammad while traveling with his army to Mecca in 630  CE, posting sentries to ensure that a female dog and her newborn puppies were not disturbed. On the other hand, in a tradition found in the Sunni \"hadith\" book \"al-Muwatta’\", Muhammad is reported as saying that the company of dogs voids a portion of a Muslim's good deeds. However, in \"two separate narrations by Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet told his companions of the virtue of saving the life of a dog by giving it water and quenching its thirst. One story referred to a man who was blessed by Allah for giving water to a thirsty dog, the other was a prostitute who filled her shoe with water and gave it to a dog, who had its tongue rolling out from thirst. For this deed she was granted the ultimate reward, the eternal Paradise under which rivers flow, to live therein forever.\"\n\nAll of the Kutub al-Sittah record Hadiths prohibiting one from keeping dogs except for farming, herding and hunting, with those not keeping them for such purposes punished with deduction of \"qirat\" from their rewards each day. In a chapter on \"al-Musaqat\" (sharecropping), Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj records fifteen traditions on the spiritual loss incurred from domestication of dogs, with seven being on the authority of 'Abd Allah ibn 'Umar and the other eight on Abu Hurairah's authority. While five reports of Ibn Umar state two Carats (\"Qiratan\") as a daily deduction for keeping dogs without a genuine purpose, the other two refer to deduction of only one Carat (\"Qirat\"). Only one report of Abu Hurairah mentions the deduction as two carats, while the other seven mentions it as one. Three hadiths in \"Dhaba'iḥ and Sayd\" of Sahih al-Bukhari are among some of the hadiths which include \nIbn Umar's tradition regarding deduction of two qirats for the same. According to a narration classified as authentic by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, jet-black dogs with two spots on the eyes are a manifestation of evil in animal form; however, according to Khaled Abou El Fadl, the majority of scholars regard this to be \"pre-Islamic Arab mythology\" and \"a tradition to be falsely attributed to the Prophet\". In spite of El Fadl's views, the hadith today continue to publish that dogs are unclean and they annul prayers.\n\nDomestic cats have a special place in Islamic culture. Muhammad is said to have loved his cat Muezza () to the extent that \"he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it.\"\n\nBig cats like the \"asad\" (, lion), \"namir\" (, leopard), and \"namur\" (, Tiger), can symbolize ferocity, similar to the wolf.\nApart from ferocity, the lion has an important position in Islam and Arab culture. Men noted for their bravery, like Ali, Hamzah ibn Abdul-Muttalib and Omar Mukhtar, were given titles like \"Asad Allāh\" (, \"Lion of God\") and \"Asad aṣ-Ṣaḥrā’\" (, \"Lion of the Desert\").\n\nA spider is supposed to have saved Muhammad and Abu Bakr by spinning a web over the entrance of the cave in which they hid. Because of the web, the persecutor of them through the cave must be empty, otherwise, there would not have been a web. Therefore, Muslims consider killing spiders as a sin.\n\nHowever, \"jurists from the Sunni Maliki School disagree with the idea that dogs are unclean.\" Individual \"faṫāwā\" (, \"rulings\") have indicated that dogs be treated kindly or otherwise released and earlier Islamic literature often portrayed dogs as symbols of highly esteemed virtues such as self-sacrifice and loyalty, which, in the hands of despotic and unjust rulers, become oppressive instruments.\n\nUsually, in Muslim majority cultures, animals have names (one animal may be given several names), which are often interchangeable with names of people. Muslim names or titles like \"asad\" and \"ghadanfar\" (Arabic for lion), \"shir\" and \"arslan\" (Persian and Turkish for lion, respectively) are common in the Muslim world. Prominent Muslims with animal names include: Hamzah, Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Al-Azdi (called \"Abu Hurairah\", the Father of the kitten), Abdul-Qadir Gilani (called \"al-baz al-ashhab\", the wise falcon) and Lal Shahbaz Qalander of Sehwan (called \"red falcon\").\n\nIslamic literature has many stories of animals. Arabic and Persian literature boast many animal fables. The most famous, \"Kalilah wa-Dimnah\" or \"Panchatantra\", translated into Arabic by Abd-Allāh Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ in the 8th century, was also known in Europe. In the 12th century, Shihab al-Din al-Suhrawadi wrote many short stories of animals. At about the same time, in north-eastern Iran, Attar Neyshapuri (Farid al-Din Attar) composed the epic poem \"Mantiq al-Tayr\" (meaning \"The Conference of the Birds\").\n\nIn Malaysia in 2016, the Malaysian Islamic Development Department, a religious governing body, prohibited the use of the term \"hot dog\" to refer to the food of that name. It asked food outlets selling them to rename their products or risk refusal of halal certification. Per local media, Malaysian halal food guidelines prohibit naming halal products after non-halal products. Islamist organization Hamas which controls the Gaza Strip, banned public dog walking in May 2017, stating it was to \"protect our women and children\". Hamas officials stated that the ban was in response to rise in dog walking on the streets which they stated was \"against culture and traditions in Gaza\".\n\nUK animal welfare organizations have decried some ritual methods of slaughter practiced in Islam (\"dhabihah\") and Judaism (\"shechita\") as inhumane and causing \"severe suffering\". According to Judy MacArthur Clark, Chairperson of the Farm Animal Welfare Council, cattle require up to two minutes to bleed to death when halal or kosher means of slaughter are used on cattle: \"This is a major incision into the animal and to say that it doesn't suffer is quite ridiculous.\" In response, Majid Katme of the Muslim Council of Britain stated that \"[i]t's a sudden and quick haemorrhage. A quick loss of blood pressure and the brain is instantaneously starved of blood and there is no time to start feeling any pain.\"\n\nIn permitting \"dhabiha\", the German Constitutional Court cited the 1978 study led by Professor Wilhelm Schulze at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover which concluded that \"[t]he slaughter in the form of ritual cut is, if carried out properly, painless in sheep and calves according to the EEG recordings and the missing defensive actions.\" Muslims and Jews have also argued that traditional British methods of slaughter have meant that \"animals are sometimes rendered physically immobile, although with full consciousness and sensation. Applying a sharp knife in \"shechita\" and \"dhabh\", by contrast, ensures that no pain is felt: the wound inflicted is clean, and the loss of blood causes the animal to lose consciousness within seconds.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The Laboratory’s research ranges from microbial oceanography to the large-scale biogeochemical processes that drive ocean ecosystems and global environmental conditions, and is organized around the three core themes of Blue Biotechnology, Ocean Biogeochemistry and Climate Change, and Ocean Health. The Laboratory's 60,000 square-foot, shore-based campus is located in East Boothbay, Maine, on the Damariscotta River estuary. In December 2012, the campus became the first LEED Platinum certified laboratory in Maine and one of seven in the New England area. The Laboratory was recently rated one of the top 10 places to work in Maine.\n\nThe majority of the Laboratory's funding comes from federal and state grants and contracts, licenses and contracts with the private sector, and philanthropic support. Bigelow Laboratory supports the work of over 70 scientists and staff. The Laboratory also maintains a library open to the public both in East Boothbay and at McKown Point in West Boothbay Harbor, Maine, in collaboration with the Maine Department of Marine Resources. \n\nThe Laboratory’s primary research focus is on the microbial life and biogeochemical dynamics of the world’s ocean, advancing society’s understanding of the interactions between ocean ecosystems, global processes, and the environment. The Laboratory’s education programs include undergraduate training through a semester program offered in affiliation with Colby College, and a National Science Foundation-funded summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. The Laboratory is also the home to several service facilities, including the Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (NCMA), the Single Cell Genomics Center (SCGC) , and the J.J. MacIsaac Facility for Aquatic Cytometry.\n\nThe Laboratory was established by Drs. Charles and Clarice Yentsch in 1974 as a private, non-profit research institution named for the oceanographer Henry Bryant Bigelow, founding Director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Dr. Bigelow’s extensive investigations in the early part of the twentieth century are recognized as the foundation of modern oceanography. His multi-year expeditions in the Gulf of Maine, where he collected water samples and data on phytoplankton, fish populations, and hydrography, established a new paradigm of intensive, ecologically-based oceanographic research in the United States and made this region one of the most thoroughly studied bodies of water, for its size, in the world. \n\nSince its founding, the Laboratory has attracted over $100 million in federal grants for research projects, winning competitive, peer reviewed awards from all of the principal federal research granting agencies. The Laboratory’s total operating revenue (including philanthropy) has grown by 68% over the past six years to $7.9 million in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012. Federal research grants have supported most of the Laboratory’s research operations and administrative needs in the past; education and outreach programs have relied on other sources of support, primarily contributions from individuals and private philanthropic foundations.\n\nFrom 2008 until his death in December 2016, the Laboratory’s executive director was Graham Shimmield, Ph.D., FRSE, a marine geochemist and former director of the Scottish Association of Marine Sciences. Interim Executive Director is Benjamin Twining, Ph.D..\n\nBigelow Laboratory’s mission is to undertake and sustain excellence in fundamental research into the ecosystems of the world’s ocean and thereby comprehend their relevance to a changing world; to promote the education and enlightenment of ocean science to society at all ages; and to directly contribute to the sustainability of research, enterprise, and knowledge exchange, both locally and nationally. Bigelow Laboratory seeks to understand key processes driving ocean ecosystems, their evolution, and their fundamental relationship to life on Earth through interrelated programs in research, education, and technology transfer. Its focus ranges from microbial oceanography to the large-scale dynamics of the global ocean.\n\nThe Laboratory’s Ocean Science and Education Campus facilities and infrastructure in East Boothbay, Maine are organized into three “Centers of Discovery”.\n\nNorton Center for Blue Biotechnology (NCBB). Research in the NCBB applies molecular biology and microbial ecology to the viruses, bacteria, archaea, and algae living in diverse environments throughout the world’s oceans in order to understand their evolution, genetic and chemical make-up, and their culture and industrial application. NCBB scientists work with the reservoir of microbial organisms in the natural environment and those preserved in cultures. The NCBB houses the world’s first microbial single cell genomics facility (SCGC), the Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (NCMA), containing one of the world’s first combined collections of marine algae, bacteria, archaea, and viruses; a flow cytometry laboratory; a bioreactor facility; and a laboratory focused on the oceanic deep biosphere. \n\nCenter for Ocean Biogeochemistry and Climate Change (COBCC). The research conducted at the COBCC addresses questions of ocean biogeochemistry and climate change at many scales, from local to global, and from individual cells to entire ocean basins. By bringing together the research activities in ocean observing, air-sea interactions, ocean biogeochemistry, cellular biogeochemistry, and land-sea interactions into a single, integrated space, the COBCC catalyzes the collaboration needed to provide scientific information on the role of microscopic marine communities in global ocean processes and climate change.\n\nCenter for Ocean Health (COH). Collectively, Bigelow Laboratory’s research brings a systems biology perspective to oceanographic research. Current developments in microbial and genomic research offer the opportunity to develop fundamental new research methods in ocean systems that go beyond traditional field-to-laboratory approaches. Research in the COH is focused on advancing the knowledge needed for future management and stewardship of marine ecosystems.\n\nThe Laboratory’s education activities include high school, undergraduate, and professional training programs; postdoctoral training and mentoring; public events and programs based on the international Café Scientifique model; and online resources for teachers and students. \n\nAt the high school level, Bigelow Laboratory offers the annual Keller BLOOM (Bigelow Laboratory Orders Of Magnitude) program for Maine high school juniors, and the BLOOM Educators' program for Maine teachers to bring ocean science into their classrooms. The week-long BLOOM programs offer participants the opportunity work alongside professional researchers, exploring the biological, chemical and geological characteristics of the local marine environment through field and laboratory work.\n\nAs part of its affiliation with Colby College in Waterville, Maine, the Laboratory offers a full semester of courses in residence at the Bigelow campus. Students live in East Boothbay, take classes from Bigelow scientists, learn how to conduct field research through a field course on the Damariscotta River, and conduct independent research with a scientist. mentor In addition, Bigelow senior scientists teach in Waterville during in the college’s “January Program,” a five-week period of intensive single course offerings between the fall and spring academic terms. \n\nThe Laboratory annually offers a ten-week summer training program as a national site of the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program.\n\nThe Laboratory has established an Office of Corporate Alliances and Technology Transfer, which works with the science staff to build portfolios of proprietary and protected intellectual property, and establish relationships with private sector partners who can help the Laboratory commercialize marketable technologies.\n"}

{"id": "888727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=888727", "title": "Flag of Earth", "text": "Flag of Earth\n\nSome individuals and organizations have promoted designs for a flag representing the planet Earth, though none have been officially recognized as such by any governmental body. The most widely recognized flags associated with Earth are the flag of the United Nations and the Earth Day flag. Listed below are some of the unofficial contenders for a Flag of Earth:\n\nA flag designed by John McConnell in 1969 for the first Earth Day is a dark blue field charged with \"The Blue Marble\", a famous NASA photo of the Earth as seen from outer space. The first edition of McConnell's flag used screen-printing and used different colors: ocean and land were blue and the clouds were white. McConnell presented his flag to the United Nations as a symbol for consideration.\n\nBecause of the political views of its creator and its having become a symbol of Earth Day, the flag is associated with environmental awareness, and the celebration of the global community. It was offered for sale originally in the \"Whole Earth Catalog\", and is the only flag which was endorsed by McConnell. \n\n\"The Blue Marble\" image was placed in the public domain, and the public nature of this image was the basis of a legal battle that resulted in the invalidation of a trademark and copyright that was originally issued to the Earth Day flag through its original promotional entity, World Equity, Inc. This does not invalidate the official history of McConnell's flag, only the official documentation that was issued on it.\n\nThe One Flag in Space initiative is an offshoot of the Space Generation Congress (SGC), the Space Generation Advisory Council's yearly world meeting. It promotes usage of the \"Blue Marble\" flag for space exploration (it does not explicitly mention it being McConnell's design).\n\nAdopted in 1946, the flag of the United Nations has been used to indicate world unity, although it technically only represents the United Nations itself. It has a geographical representation of the planet, and its high visibility usage makes it a well-known contender for representing Earth. During the planning for NASA's moon landings of the 1960s, it was suggested that a UN flag be used in place of the flag of the US.\n\nJames William van Kirk, a minister from Youngstown, Ohio, designed in 1913 a peace flag with rainbow stripes, stars and a globe. With this flag, he twice made a peace tour through Europe. The Universal Peace Congress adopted this flag as its World Peace Flag.\n\nDesigned by Pierre de Coubertin in 1914 and adopted in Olympic games since 1920, the Olympic flag represents all mankind and has a white bar with 5 interlocking rings of 5 colors. The five rings represent the five continents. The six colors (including the white color of the background) represent all of the world's nations.\n\nThe World Citizen is a social movement for global citizenship under a proposed world government. In 1953, one of its activists, Garry Davis, founded the World Service Authority, which sells the World Passport (a fantasy travel document) with a proposed flag of the world.\n\nThe astrological (and astronomical) symbol of Earth is another candidate for Earth's flag, often depicted with a blue background, with the symbol at its center.\n\nAnother Earth flag was created around the same time in 1970 by a farmer from Homer, Illinois named James W. Cadle. Cadle's version of the Earth flag consists of a blue circle representing Earth in the center of the flag, a segment of a large yellow circle representing the sun and a small white circle for the moon, all on a black background. It is particularly popular amongst SETI researchers and is used by SETI worldwide. The flag flies at the Ohio State University Radio Observatory and was lowered to half mast when Carl Sagan died. Flag of Earth Co. International was also founded by Cadle which sold the flag. The Flag of Earth became public domain in 2003.\n\nThe World Flag is an international flag created in 1988 by Paul Carroll to act as a symbol to inspire \"positive global change while continuing to embrace and celebrate cultural diversity.\" The current 2008 version of the combined World Flag has a world map 216 flags; including the flags of every UN member state, the United Nations, and several territories of larger nations.\n\nThe World Flag has been flown at the UN Headquarters for the \"A Prayer for Peace\" event, The World Trade Center, Earth Day in Central Park, and at various other events around the world.\n\nIn 2015 a Swedish artist, Oskar Pernefeldt, proposed the \"International Flag of the Planet Earth\". It was conceived to be used in space expeditions and it has two main purposes: \n\nThe creators predict that it will be eventually used in Mars landing in 2025 or in a future colony on that planet. The flag is used by space research groups with intent to implanting a base on Mars. The design of the flag consists of seven rings intersecting each other and a deep-blue-sea in the background. The rings are centered on the flag forming a flower in the middle, representing life on Earth. The intersection of the rings represent that all things on Earth are linked directly or indirectly. The rings are organized in a Borromean rings–like fashion, representing not only the seven continents, but how no part of Earth can be removed without the whole structure collapsing. Finally, the deep-blue represents the ocean and the importance of water for life on Earth.\n\nThe One World Flag is a concept published in 2018 by the German activist and visual artist Thomas Mandl. The design of the flag consists of a blue circle on a translucent blank background. Through the usage of Sheer fabrics, the environment blends into the flag background and thus becomes an integral part of the flag design representing the ever-changing nature of culture, society, politics, and environment of the planet earth. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "4387132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4387132", "title": "Gravity of Earth", "text": "Gravity of Earth\n\nThe gravity of Earth, denoted by , is the net acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of gravitation (from distribution of mass within Earth) and the centrifugal force (from the Earth's rotation).\n\nIn SI units this acceleration is measured in metres per second squared (in symbols, m/s or m·s) or equivalently in newtons per kilogram (N/kg or N·kg). Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s, which means that, ignoring the effects of air resistance, the speed of an object falling freely will increase by about 9.8 metres per second every second. This quantity is sometimes referred to informally as \"little \" (in contrast, the gravitational constant is referred to as \"big \").\n\nThe precise strength of Earth's gravity varies depending on location. The nominal \"average\" value at Earth's surface, known as is, by definition, 9.80665 m/s. This quantity is denoted variously as , (though this sometimes means the normal equatorial value on Earth, 9.78033 m/s), , gee, or simply (which is also used for the variable local value). \n\nThe weight of an object on Earth's surface is the downwards force on that object, given by Newton's second law of motion, or (). Gravitational acceleration contributes to the total gravity acceleration, but other factors, such as the rotation of Earth, also contribute, and, therefore, affect the weight of the object.\nGravity does not normally include the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, which are accounted for in terms of tidal effects.\nIt is a vector (physics) quantity, whose direction coincides with a plumb bob.\n\nA non-rotating perfect sphere of uniform mass density, or whose density varies solely with distance from the centre (spherical symmetry), would produce a gravitational field of uniform magnitude at all points on its surface. The Earth is rotating and is also not spherically symmetric; rather, it is slightly flatter at the poles while bulging at the Equator: an oblate spheroid. There are consequently slight deviations in the magnitude of gravity across its surface.\n\nGravity on the Earth's surface varies by around 0.7%, from 9.7639 m/s on the Nevado Huascarán mountain in Peru to 9.8337 m/s at the surface of the Arctic Ocean. In large cities, it ranges from 9.7760 in Kuala Lumpur, Mexico City, and Singapore to 9.825 in Oslo and Helsinki.\n\nIn 1901 the third General Conference on Weights and Measures defined a standard gravitational acceleration for the surface of the Earth: \"g\" = 9.80665 m/s. It was based on measurements done at the Pavillon de Breteuil near Paris in 1888, with a theoretical correction applied in order to convert to a latitude of 45° at sea level. This definition is thus not a value of any particular place or carefully worked out average, but an agreement for a value to use if a better actual local value is not known or not important. It is also used to define the units kilogram force and pound force.\n\nThe surface of the Earth is rotating, so it is not an inertial frame of reference. At latitudes nearer the Equator, the outward centrifugal force produced by Earth's rotation is larger than at polar latitudes. This counteracts the Earth's gravity to a small degree – up to a maximum of 0.3% at the Equator – and reduces the apparent downward acceleration of falling objects.\n\nThe second major reason for the difference in gravity at different latitudes is that the Earth's equatorial bulge (itself also caused by centrifugal force from rotation) causes objects at the Equator to be farther from the planet's centre than objects at the poles. Because the force due to gravitational attraction between two bodies (the Earth and the object being weighed) varies inversely with the square of the distance between them, an object at the Equator experiences a weaker gravitational pull than an object at the poles.\n\nIn combination, the equatorial bulge and the effects of the surface centrifugal force due to rotation mean that sea-level gravity increases from about 9.780 m/s at the Equator to about 9.832 m/s at the poles, so an object will weigh about 0.5% more at the poles than at the Equator.\n\nGravity decreases with altitude as one rises above the Earth's surface because greater altitude means greater distance from the Earth's centre. All other things being equal, an increase in altitude from sea level to causes a weight decrease of about 0.29%. (An additional factor affecting apparent weight is the decrease in air density at altitude, which lessens an object's buoyancy. This would increase a person's apparent weight at an altitude of 9,000 metres by about 0.08%)\n\nIt is a common misconception that astronauts in orbit are weightless because they have flown high enough to escape the Earth's gravity. In fact, at an altitude of , equivalent to a typical orbit of the ISS, gravity is still nearly 90% as strong as at the Earth's surface. Weightlessness actually occurs because orbiting objects are in free-fall.\n\nThe effect of ground elevation depends on the density of the ground (see Slab correction section). A person flying at 30 000 ft above sea level over mountains will feel more gravity than someone at the same elevation but over the sea. However, a person standing on the earth's surface feels less gravity when the elevation is higher.\n\nThe following formula approximates the Earth's gravity variation with altitude:\n\nWhere\n\nThe formula treats the Earth as a perfect sphere with a radially symmetric distribution of mass; a more accurate mathematical treatment is discussed below.\n\nAn approximate value for gravity at a distance from the center of the Earth can be obtained by assuming that the Earth's density is spherically symmetric. The gravity depends only on the mass inside the sphere of radius . All the contributions from outside cancel out as a consequence of the inverse-square law of gravitation. Another consequence is that the gravity is the same as if all the mass were concentrated at the center. Thus, the gravitational acceleration at this radius is\nwhere is the gravitational constant and is the total mass enclosed within radius . If the Earth had a constant density , the mass would be and the dependence of gravity on depth would be\nIf the density decreased linearly with increasing radius from a density at the center to at the surface, then , and the dependence would be\n\nThe actual depth dependence of density and gravity, inferred from seismic travel times (see Adams–Williamson equation), is shown in the graphs below.\n\nLocal differences in topography (such as the presence of mountains), geology (such as the density of rocks in the vicinity), and deeper tectonic structure cause local and regional differences in the Earth's gravitational field, known as gravitational anomalies. Some of these anomalies can be very extensive, resulting in bulges in sea level, and throwing pendulum clocks out of synchronisation.\n\nThe study of these anomalies forms the basis of gravitational geophysics. The fluctuations are measured with highly sensitive gravimeters, the effect of topography and other known factors is subtracted, and from the resulting data conclusions are drawn. Such techniques are now used by prospectors to find oil and mineral deposits. Denser rocks (often containing mineral ores) cause higher than normal local gravitational fields on the Earth's surface. Less dense sedimentary rocks cause the opposite.\n\nIn air, objects experience a supporting buoyancy force which reduces the apparent strength of gravity (as measured by an object's weight). The magnitude of the effect depends on air density (and hence air pressure); see Apparent weight for details.\n\nThe gravitational effects of the Moon and the Sun (also the cause of the tides) have a very small effect on the apparent strength of Earth's gravity, depending on their relative positions; typical variations are 2 µm/s (0.2 mGal) over the course of a day.\n\nGravity acceleration is a vector quantity. In a spherically symmetric Earth, gravity would point directly towards the sphere's centre. As the Earth is slightly flatter, there are consequently slight deviations in the direction of gravity.\n\nTools exist for calculating the strength of gravity at various cities around the world. The effect of latitude can be clearly seen with gravity in high-latitude cities: Anchorage (9.826 m/s), Helsinki (9.825 m/s), being about 0.5% greater than that in cities near the equator: Kuala Lumpur (9.776 m/s), Manila (9.780 m/s). The effect of altitude can be seen in Mexico City (9.776 m/s; altitude ), and by comparing Denver (9.798 m/s; ) with Washington, D.C. (9.801 m/s; ), both of which are near 39° N. Measured values can be obtained from Physical and Mathematical Tables by T.M. Yarwood and F. Castle, Macmillan, revised edition 1970.\n\nIf the terrain is at sea level, we can estimate formula_5, the acceleration at latitude formula_6:\n\nThis is the International Gravity Formula 1967, the 1967 Geodetic Reference System Formula, Helmert's equation or Clairaut's formula.\n\nAn alternative formula for \"g\" as a function of latitude is the WGS (World Geodetic System) 84 Ellipsoidal Gravity Formula:\nwhere,\n\n\nthen, where formula_13,\n\nThe difference between the WGS-84 formula and Helmert's equation is less than 0.68 μm·s.\n\nThe first correction to be applied to the model is the free air correction (FAC) that accounts for heights above sea level. Near the surface of the Earth (sea level), gravity decreases with height such that linear extrapolation would give zero gravity at a height of one half of the earth's radius - (9.8 m·s per 3,200 km.)\n\nUsing the mass and radius of the Earth:\n\nThe FAC correction factor (Δ\"g\") can be derived from the definition of the acceleration due to gravity in terms of G, the Gravitational Constant (see Estimating \"g\" from the law of universal gravitation, below):\n\nwhere:\n\nAt a height \"h\" above the nominal surface of the earth \"g\" is given by:\n\nSo the FAC for a height \"h\" above the nominal earth radius can be expressed:\n\nThis expression can be readily used for programming or inclusion in a spreadsheet. Collecting terms, simplifying and neglecting small terms (\"h\"«\"r\"), however yields the good approximation:\n\nUsing the numerical values above and for a height \"h\" in metres:\n\nGrouping the latitude and FAC altitude factors the expression most commonly found in the literature is:\nwhere formula_24 = acceleration in m·s at latitude formula_25 and altitude \"h\" in metres.\n\nFor flat terrain above sea level a second term is added for the gravity due to the extra mass; for this purpose the extra mass can be approximated by an infinite horizontal slab, and we get 2π\"G\" times the mass per unit area, i.e. 4.2 m·s·kg (0.042 μGal·kg·m) (the Bouguer correction). For a mean rock density of 2.67 g·cm this gives 1.1 s (0.11 mGal·m). Combined with the free-air correction this means a reduction of gravity at the surface of ca. 2 µm·s (0.20 mGal) for every metre of elevation of the terrain. (The two effects would cancel at a surface rock density of 4/3 times the average density of the whole earth. The density of the whole earth is 5.515 g·cm, so standing on a slab of something like iron whose density is over 7.35 g·cm would increase one's weight.)\n\nFor the gravity below the surface we have to apply the free-air correction as well as a double Bouguer correction. With the infinite slab model this is because moving the point of observation below the slab changes the gravity due to it to its opposite. Alternatively, we can consider a spherically symmetrical Earth and subtract from the mass of the Earth that of the shell outside the point of observation, because that does not cause gravity inside. This gives the same result.\n\nFrom the law of universal gravitation, the force on a body acted upon by Earth's gravity is given by\n\nwhere \"r\" is the distance between the centre of the Earth and the body (see below), and here we take \"m\" to be the mass of the Earth and \"m\" to be the mass of the body.\n\nAdditionally, Newton's second law, \"F\" = \"ma\", where \"m\" is mass and \"a\" is acceleration, here tells us that\n\nComparing the two formulas it is seen that:\n\nSo, to find the acceleration due to gravity at sea level, substitute the values of the gravitational constant, \"G\", the Earth's mass (in kilograms), \"m\", and the Earth's radius (in metres), \"r\", to obtain the value of \"g\":\n\nNote that this formula only works because of the mathematical fact that the gravity of a uniform spherical body, as measured on or above its surface, is the same as if all its mass were concentrated at a point at its centre. This is what allows us to use the Earth's radius for \"r\".\n\nThe value obtained agrees approximately with the measured value of \"g\". The difference may be attributed to several factors, mentioned above under \"Variations\":\nThere are significant uncertainties in the values of \"r\" and \"m\" as used in this calculation, and the value of \"G\" is also rather difficult to measure precisely.\n\nIf \"G\", \"g\" and \"r\" are known then a reverse calculation will give an estimate of the mass of the Earth. This method was used by Henry Cavendish.\n\n\n"}

The world standings system for synchronized skating and the season's world ranking had not been implemented until 2010.\n\nAccording to the \"ISU Communication 1629\" and \"ISU Communication 1630\" published by the ISU on July 21, 2010, the ISU Council decided to implement two types of World Standings / Ranking, namely \"ISU World Standings\" and \"ISU Season's World Ranking\", since the 2010–11 season.\n\nThe ISU World Standings for single & pair skating and ice dance, are taking into account results of the preceding two seasons and the current season and remains the basis for the draws at ISU events and part of the criteria for the selection of competitors for the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating and other ISU events designated by the ISU Council.\n\nThe ISU Season's World Ranking, is based on the results of the current ongoing season only.

Due to limits on entries to events (no more than three from each country), and varying numbers of high-level skaters/teams in each country, skaters/teams from some countries may find it more difficult to qualify to compete at major events. Thus, a skater/team with a lower season's best but from a country with few high-level skaters/teams may qualify to a major event while a skater/team with a much higher season's best but from a country with more than three high-level skaters/teams may not be sent.

{"id": "40243586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40243586", "title": "Islam and cats", "text": "Islam and cats\n\nThe domestic cat is a revered animal in Islam. Admired for its cleanliness as well as for being loved by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, the cat is considered \"the quintessential pet\" by Muslims.\n\nCats have been venerated in the Near East since antiquity, a tradition adopted by Islam, albeit in a much modified form. According to many hadiths, Muhammad prohibited the persecution and killing of cats.\nOne of Muhammad's companions was known as Abu Hurairah (literally: \"Father of the Kitten\") for his attachment to cats. Abu Hurairah claimed that he had heard Muhammad declare that a woman went to Hell for starving a female kitten and not providing her with any water, but this was disputed by Muhammad's widow Aisha. According to legend, Abu Hurairah's cat saved Muhammad from a snake. In gratitude, Muhammad stroked the cat's back and forehead, thus blessing all cats with the righting reflex. The stripes some cats have on their foreheads are believed to mark the touch of Muhammad's fingers.\n\nThe American poet and travel author Bayard Taylor (1825–1878) was astonished when he discovered a Syrian hospital where cats roamed freely. The institution, in which domestic felines were sheltered and nourished, was funded by a waqf, along with caretakers' wages, veterinary care and cat food. Edward William Lane (1801–1876), a British Orientalist who resided in Cairo, described a cat garden originally endowed by the 13th-century Egyptian sultan Baibars, whose European contemporaries held a very different attitude towards cats, eating them or killing them under papal decrees. Wilfred Thesiger, in his book \"The Marsh Arabs\", notes that cats were allowed free entry to community buildings in villages in the Mesopotamian Marshes, and even fed, though dogs and other animals were driven out. Aside from protecting granaries and food stores from pests, cats were valued by the paper-based Arab-Islamic cultures for preying on mice that destroyed books. For that reason, cats are often depicted in paintings alongside Islamic scholars and bibliophiles. The medieval Egyptian zoologist Al-Damiri (1344–1405) wrote that the first cat was created when God caused a lion to sneeze, after animals on Noah's Ark complained of mice.\n\nIn Islamic tradition, cats are admired for their cleanliness. They are thought to be ritually clean, unlike dogs, and are thus allowed to enter homes and even mosques, including Masjid al-Haram. Food sampled by cats is considered halal and water from which cats have drunk is permitted for wudu. Furthermore, there is a widespread belief among Muslims that cats seek out people who are praying.\n\nMuslim scholars are divided on the issue of neutering animals. Most, however, maintain that neutering cats is allowed \"if there is some benefit in neutering the cat and if that will not cause its death\". Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen, a 20th-century Saudi Arabian Sunni imam, preached:\n\nA UK-based pet food company, Halal Pet Products Ltd, produces what they claim to be a completely halal cat food, which they named Muezza Pure. The company justifies their development of the product by asserting that, while there are no laws in Islam prohibiting animals from eating haram foods, Muslims are forbidden to handle or feed haram foods, such as pork and carrion, to animals.\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, Muezza (or Muʿizza) () was Muhammad's favorite cat. In legend, Muhammad awoke one day to the sounds of the adhan. Preparing to attend prayer, he began to dress himself; however, he soon discovered his cat Muezza sleeping on the sleeve of his prayer robe. Rather than wake her, he used a pair of scissors to cut the sleeve off, leaving the cat undisturbed. Another story is, upon returning from the mosque, Muhammad received a bow from Muezza. He then smiled and gently stroked his beloved cat three times.\n\nWhile the folktale of Muezza is found in both Muslim and non-Muslim sources and many hadith reference cats in a positive manner, it does not appear to be attested before the 20th century. It may be based on a similar story told by the followers of the medieval Sufi sheikh Ahmed ar-Rifa'i, who is also said to have cut his sleeve because a cat was sleeping on it, then stitched it up later and said \"nothing changed\".\n\n\n"}

This happens through light scattered by the imaging mechanism itself, for example through internal reflection and scattering from material imperfections in the lens. Lenses with large numbers of elements such as zooms tend to exhibit greater lens flare, as they contain a relatively large number of interfaces at which internal scattering may occur. These mechanisms differ from the focused image generation mechanism, which depends on rays from the refraction of light from the subject itself. \n\nFlare manifests itself in two ways: as visible artifacts, and as a haze across the image. The haze makes the image look \"washed out\" by reducing contrast and color saturation (adding light to dark image regions, and adding white to saturated regions, reducing their saturation). Visible artifacts, usually in the shape of the lens iris, are formed when light follows a pathway through the lens that contains one or more reflections from the lens surfaces.\n\nFlare is particularly caused by very bright light sources. Most commonly, this occurs when shooting into the sun (when the sun is in frame or the lens is pointed in the direction of the sun), and is reduced by using a lens hood or other shade. For good-quality optical systems, and for most images (which do not have a bright light shining into the lens), flare is a secondary effect that is widely distributed across the image and thus not visible, although it does reduce contrast.\n\nThe spatial distribution of the lens flare typically manifests as several starbursts, rings, or circles in a row across the image or view. Lens flare patterns typically spread widely across the scene and change location with the camera's movement relative to light sources, tracking with the light position and fading as the camera points away from the bright light until it causes no flare at all. The specific spatial distribution of the flare depends on the shape of the aperture of the image formation elements. For example, if the lens has a 6-bladed aperture, the flare may have a hexagonal pattern.\n\nSuch internal scattering is also present in the human eye, and manifests in an unwanted veiling glare most obvious when viewing very bright lights or highly reflective surfaces. In some situations, eyelashes can also create flare-like irregularities, although these are technically diffraction artifacts.\n\nWhen a bright light source is shining on the lens but not in its field of view, lens flare appears as a haze that washes out the image and reduces contrast. This can be avoided by shading the lens using a lens hoods. In a studio, a gobo or set of barn doors can be attached to the lighting to keep it from shining on the camera. Filters can be attached to the camera lens which will also minimise lens flare, which is especially useful for outdoor photographers.\n\nWhen using an anamorphic lens, as is common in analog cinematography, lens flare can manifest itself as horizontal lines. This is most commonly seen in car headlights in a dark scene, and may be desired as part of the \"film look\".\n\nA lens flare is often deliberately used to invoke a sense of drama. A lens flare is also useful when added to an artificial or modified image composition because it adds a sense of realism, implying that the image is an un-edited original photograph of a \"real life\" scene.\n\nFor both of these reasons (implying realism and/or drama) artificial lens flare is a common effect in various graphics editing programs, although its use can be a point of contention among professional graphic designers. Lens flare was one of the first special effects developed for computer graphics because it can be imitated using relatively simple means. Basic flare-like effects, for instance in computer and video games, can be obtained using static or animated starburst, ring, and disc textures that are moved according to the position of the light source. More sophisticated rendering techniques have been developed based on ray tracing or photon mapping.\n\nLens flare was typically avoided by Hollywood cinematographers, but when filming \"Easy Rider\", Harrison Arnold was forced to modify a camera car for his Arriflex, which resulted in numerous lens flares as he shot motorcycle footage against Southwestern U.S. landscapes.\n\nCostume designer Rita Riggs purposefully would sometimes dress Bea Arthur in \"Maude\" in a red that would flare to make a statement, to match Maude's personality as a \"red flag\".\n\nDirector J. J. Abrams added numerous lens flares to his films \"Star Trek\" and \"Super 8\" by aiming powerful off-camera light sources at the lens. He explained in an interview about Star Trek: \"I wanted a visual system that felt unique. I know there are certain shots where even I watch and think, 'Oh that's ridiculous, that was too many.' But I love the idea that the future was so bright it couldn't be contained in the frame.\" Many complained of the frequent use; Abrams admitted it was \"overdone, in some places.\"\n\nDavid Boyd, the director of photography of the sci-fi \"Firefly\" series, desired this style so much (harkening back to 1970s television), that he sent back cutting-edge lenses that reduced lens flare in exchange for cheaper ones.\n\nThe first deliberate lens flare was made by cinematographer Hiroshi Segawa in the movie Woman in the Dunes in 1964. Earlier in the movies, lens flare was considered as defect and was strongly avoided.\n\nDirector Michael Bay, well-known for heavy use of CGI in his films, digitally adds lens flares to most light sources in his films.\n\nThe use of photographic filters can cause flare, particularly ghosts of bright lights (under central inversion). This can be eliminated by not using a filter, and reduced by using higher-quality filters or narrower aperture.\n\nOne form of flare is specific to digital cameras. With the sun shining on an unprotected lens, a group of small rainbows appears. This artifact is formed by internal diffraction on the image sensor, which acts like a diffraction grating. Unlike true lens flare, this artifact is not visible in the eyepiece of a digital SLR camera, making it more difficult to avoid.\n\n"}

By weight, its mineral composition is about 40–40–20% concentration of sand-silt-clay, respectively. These proportions can vary to a degree, however, and result in different types of loam soils: sandy loam, silty loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, and loam. In the USDA textural classification triangle, the only soil that is not predominantly sand, silt, or clay is called \"loam\". Loam soils generally contain more nutrients, moisture, and humus than sandy soils, have better drainage and infiltration of water and air than silt and clay-rich soils, and are easier to till than clay soils. The different types of loam soils each have slightly different characteristics, with some draining liquids more efficiently than others. The soil's texture, especially its ability to retain nutrients and water are crucial. Loam soil is suitable for growing most plant varieties.\n\nBricks made of loam, mud, sand, and water, with an added binding material such as rice husks or straw, have been used in construction since ancient times.\n\nLoam is considered ideal for gardening and agricultural uses because it retains nutrients well and retains water while still allowing excess water to drain away. A soil dominated by one or two of the three particle size groups can behave like loam if it has a strong granular structure, promoted by a high content of organic matter. However, a soil that meets the textural definition of loam can lose its characteristic desirable qualities when it is compacted, depleted of organic matter, or has clay dispersed throughout its fine-earth fraction.\n\nLoam is found in a majority of successful farms in regions around the world known for their fertile land. Loam soil feels soft and crumbly and is easy to work over a wide range of moisture conditions.\n\nLoam may be used for the construction of houses, for example in loam post and beam construction. Building crews can build a layer of loam on the inside of walls, which can help to control air humidity. Loam, combined with straw, can be used as a rough construction material to build walls. This is one of the oldest technologies for house construction in the world. Within this there are two broad methods: the use of rammed earth, or unfired bricks (adobe).\n"}

The term can also be extended to mythological lands generally, to underground civilizations, or even to whole planets.\n\nThe classification of lost lands as continents, islands, or other regions is in some cases subjective; for example, Atlantis is variously described as either a \"lost island\" or a \"lost continent\".

{"id": "12418604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12418604", "title": "Mount Olympus", "text": "Mount Olympus\n\nMount Olympus (; \"Olympos\", for Modern Greek also transliterated \"Olimbos\", or ) is the highest mountain in Greece. It is located in the Olympus Range on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia, between the regional units of Pieria and Larissa, about southwest from Thessaloniki. Mount Olympus has 52 peaks, deep gorges, and exceptional biodiversity. The highest peak, Mytikas (Μύτικας \"Mýtikas\"), meaning \"nose\", rises to . It is one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence.\n\nOlympus was notable in Greek mythology as the home of the Greek gods, on Mytikas peak. Mount Olympus is also noted for its rich flora. It has been a National Park, the first in Greece, since 1938. It is also a World Biosphere Reserve.\n\nEvery year, thousands of people visit Olympus to admire its fauna and flora, tour its slopes, and reach its peaks. Organized mountain refuges and various mountaineering and climbing routes are available to visitors who want to explore it. The usual starting point for climbing Olympus is the town of Litochoro, on the eastern foothills of the mountain, 100 km from Thessaloniki.\n\nThe shape of Olympus was formed by rain and wind, which produced an isolated tower almost above the sea, which is only away at Litochoro. Olympus has many peaks and an almost circular shape. The mountain has a circumference of , an average diameter of , and of area. To the northwest lies the Vlach village of Kokkinoplou. The Makryrema stream separates Olympus from the massif of Voulgara. The villages Petra, Vrontou and Dion lie to the northwest, while on the eastern side there is the town of Litochoro, where Enipeas bisects the massif of Olympus. On its southeastern side, the Ziliana gorge divides Mount Olympus from Kato Olympos (Lower Olympus), while on its southwestern foothills, there are the villages Sykaminea and Karya. The Agia Triada Sparmou Monastery and the village Pythion lie to the west.\n\nOlympus' dry foothills, known as the Xirokampi, are covered in chaparral and provides habitat for animals such as wild boar. Further east, the plain of Dion is fertile and watered by the streams which originate on Olympus.\nMount Olympus is formed of sedimentary rock laid down 200 million years ago in a shallow sea. Various geological events that followed caused the emergence of the whole region and the sea. Around one million years ago glaciers covered Olympus and created its plateaus and depressions. With the temperature rise that followed, the ice melted and the streams that were created swept away large quantities of crushed rock in the lowest places, forming the alluvial fans, that spread out all over the region from the foothills of the mountain to the sea. The Geological Museum of Mount Olympus, located in Leptokarya, provides detailed information about the geological structure of the mountain.\n\nThe complicated geological past of the region is obvious from the morphology of Olympus and its National Park. Features include deep gorges and dozens of smooth peaks, many of them in altitude of more than , including Aghios Antonios (), Kalogeros (), Toumpa () and Profitis Ilias (). However, it is the central, almost vertical, rocky peaks, that impress the visitor. Over the town of Litochoro, on the horizon, the relief of the mountain displays an apparent V, between two peaks of almost equal height. The left limb is the peak named Mytikas (or Pantheon). It is Greece's highest peak. Then, on the right is Stefani (or Thronos Dios [Throne of Zeus]), which presents the most impressive and steep peak of Olympus, with its last sharply rising 200 meters presenting the greatest challenge for climbers. Further south, Skolio ( second highest peak – ) completes an arc of about 200 degrees, with its steep slopes forming on the west side, like a wall, an impressive precipitous amphitheatrical cavity, in depth and in circumference, the 'Megala Kazania'. On the east side of the high peaks the steep slopes form zone like parallel folds, the 'Zonaria'. Even narrower and steeper scorings, the 'Loukia', lead to the peak.\n\nΟn the north side, between Stefani and Profitis Ilias, extends the Muses' Plateau, at , while further south, almost in the center of the massif, extends the alpine tundra region of Bara, at an altitude of . Olympus has numerous ravines and gullies. Most distinguishable of the ravines are those of Mavrologos-Enipeas (14 km) and Mavratzas-Sparmos (13 km) near Bara and 'cut' the massif in two oval portions. On the southern foothills the great gorge of Ziliana, 13 km long, consists of a natural limit that separates the mountain from Lower Olympus. There are also many precipices and a number of caves, even nowadays unexplored. The form and layout of the rocks favor the emergence of numerous springs, mainly lower than 2,000 m, of small seasonal lakes and streams and of a small river, Enipeas, with its springs in the site Prionia and its estuary in the Aegean Sea.\n\nThe origin of the name Όλυμπος \"Olumpos\" is unknown and usually considered of \"pre-Greek\" origin. In Homeric Greek (\"Odyssey\" 6.42), the variant Οὔλυμπος \"Oulumpos\" occurs, conceived of as the seat of the gods (and not identified with any specific peak).\nHomer (\"Iliad\" 5.754, \"Odyssey\" 20.103) also appears to be using οὔλυμπος as a common noun, as a synonym of οὐρανός \"ouranos\" \"sky\".\nMt Olympus was historically also known as \"Mount Belus\", after \"Iliad\" 1.591, where the seat of the gods is referred to as βηλ[ός] θεσπεσίο[ς] \"heavenly threshold\".\n\nIn Ancient Greek religion and mythology, \"Olympus\" was the name of the home of the Twelve Olympian gods of the ancient Greek world.\nThis was conceived of as a lofty mountaintop, and in all regions settled by Greek tribes, the highest local elevation tended to be so named; among the numerous peaks called \"Olumpos\" in antiquity are mountains in Mysia, Laconia, Lycia, Cyprus, Attica, Euboea, Ionia and Lesbos, and others.\nThessalian Olympus is the highest peak in any territory with Greek settlement and came to be seen as the \"Pan-Hellenic\" representative of the mythological seat of the gods, by at least the 5th century BC, as Herodotus (1.56) identifies Olympus as the peak in Thessaly.\n\nIn Pieria, at Olympus's northern foot, the mythological tradition had placed the nine Muses, patrons of the Fine Arts, daughters of Zeus and the Titanide Mnemosyne.\n\nIn antiquity, the Olympus massif forms the border between Thessaly and Macedon. The history of the surrounding area is consequently of interest in the context of the Rise of Macedon, the Chremonidean War and the Macedonian Wars during the 4th to 2nd centuries BC.\nIn the period of the Ottoman Empire the mountain was a hiding place and base of operations for klephts and armatoloi.\n\nIn Olympus, the second armatoliki was founded, led by Kara Michalis in 1489. The action of the klephts in Olympus led the Turks to visit their outrage on the klephts' ally-village of Milia (in the late 17th century), which they destroyed. In that period Livadi in Olympus became the seat of the armatoliki of Olympus and Western Macedonia, with their first renowned commander Panos Zidros. In the 18th century the Turks had to replace the armatoloi (who very often joined the klephts) with Moslem Albanian armatoloi who ravaged the countryside of Macedonia. However, Olympus' armatoloi, even after their capitulation to Ali Pasha, never ceased fighting on land and at sea. Among them who were active there and in nearby regions were Nikotsaras, Giorgakis Olympios and the legendary family of Lazaioi. In the early 20th century, even for some time after the liberation from the Ottoman Empire (1912), robbers were active in the region – the best known of them the notorious Giagoulas, while during the German invasion in 1941 the Greek army fought significant battles along with units of New Zealanders and Australians. During the German Occupation (1941–1944) the mountain was one of the centers of the Greek Resistance, while a little later the Greek Civil War (1946–49) started there, in Litochoro.\n\nThe whole region of Pieria's Olympus was declared archaeological and historical site for the preservation of its monumental and historical character. Five km away from the sea is Dion, sacred city of the ancient Macedons, dedicated to Zeus and the Twelve Olympians. Its prosperity lasted from the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD. The excavations, continuing since 1928, have revealed numerous findings of the Macedonian, the Hellenistic and the Roman period. Currently there is a unique archaeological park of 200 hectares, with the ancient town and the sacred places of worship, outside its walls. Many statues and other invaluable items are kept in the nearby Dion's archaeological museum. Pimblia and Leivithra, two other towns in Olympus' region, are related to Orpheus and the \"Orphic\" mysteries. According to a tradition Orpheus, son of Apollo and Calliope (one of the Muses), taught here the mystic ceremonies of worship of Dionysus (also known as Bacchus). By the sea, in a strategic position, at Macedonia's gates is located Platamon Castle, built between 7th and 10th century AD in the ancient town of Heracleia. To the north the ancient Pydna is located. Here, in 168 BC, the decisive battle between the Macedonians and the Romans took place. Between Pydna and Mount Olympus are a fortified bishops seat from the Byzantine period called Louloudies and the Macedonian Tombs of Katerini and Korinos.\n\nIn the Olympus region, there are also several Christian monuments, among them the highest-altitude chapel of Orthodox Christianity, dedicated to Prophet Elias, in Greek tradition associated with mountaintops, on the summit of the same name (Προφήτης Ηλίας \"Profitis Ilias\"), at 2,803 m.\nIt was built in the 16th century by Saint Dionysios of Olympus, who also founded the most significant monastery in the region. The Old Monastery of Dionysios (altitude 820 m) lies in Enipeas' gorge and is accessible by car from Litochoro. It was looted and burned by the Ottomans and in 1943 it was destroyed by the German invaders, who suspected it was a guerilla den. Nowadays it has been partially restored and operates as a dependency of the New Monastery of Dionysios, that is outside Litochoro. On Olympus' southern foot, in a dominant position (820 m) in Ziliana gorge, there is the Kanalon Monastery, 8 km away from Karya. It was founded in 1055 by the monks Damianos and Joakim and since 2001 it has been restored and operates as a convent. Further west, in the edge of Mavratza stream, at 1,020 m, there is the Agia Triada Sparmou Monastery, that flourished in the early 18th century, possessed great property and assisted to establish the famous Tsaritsani' school. It was abandoned in 1932, but in 2000 it was completely renovated and reopened as a male monastery, affiliated to Elassona's diocese.\n\nThe third highest peak of Mt Olympus, called \"Agios Antonios\" (Άγιος Αντώνιος \"Saint Anthony\", , 2,817 m), is known to have been the site of a sanctuary of Zeus in antiquity based on archaeological finds discovered in 1961. In the modern era, a series of explorers tried to study the mountain and to tried to reach its summit. Examples include the French archaeologist Leon Heuzey (1855), the German explorer Heinrich Barth (1862), and the German engineer Edward Richter. Richter tried to reach the summit in 1911 but was abducted by klephts, who also killed the Ottoman gendarmes that accompanied him.\n\nIt was just one year after the liberation of Greece from Ottoman rule, on 2 August 1913, that the summit of Olympus was finally reached. The Swiss Frédéric Boissonnas and Daniel Baud-Bovy, aided by a hunter of wild goats from Litochoro, Christos Kakkalos, were the first to reach Greece's highest peak. Kakkalos, who had much experience climbing Olympus, was the first of the three to climb Mytikas. Afterwards, and till his death in 1976, he was the official guide on Olympus. In 1921, he and Marcel Kurz reached the second highest summit of Olympus, Stefani. Based on these explorations, Kurz in 1923 edited \"Le Mont Olympe\", a book that includes the first detailed map of the summits. In 1928, the painter Vasilis Ithakisios climbed Olympus together with Kakalos, reaching a cave that he named \"Shelter of the Muses\", and he spent many summers painting views of the mountain. Olympus was later photographed and mapped in detail by others, and a series of successful climbs and winter ascents of the steepest summits in difficult weather conditions took place.\n\nClimbing Mount Olympus is a non-technical hike, except for the final section from the Skala summit to the Mytikas peak, which is a YDS class 3 rock scramble. It is estimated that 10,000 people climb Mount Olympus each year, most of them reaching only the Skolio summit. Most climbs of Mount Olympus start from the town of Litochoro, which took the name \"City of Gods\" because of its location at the foot of the mountain. From there a road goes to Prionia, where the hike begins at the bottom of the mountain.\n\nGenerally speaking Olympus' climate can be described as one of mediterranean type with continental influence. Its local variations is the result of the impact of the sea and the rugged relief of the region. In the lower locations (Litochoro and the foothills) the climate is typically mediterranean, i.e. hot and dry in the summer, while humid and cold in the winter. Higher it is more humid and severe, with more intense phenomena; in these locations it often snows all over the winter, while raining and snowing is not unusual, even in the summer. The temperature varies in the winter from −10 °C to 10 °C and in the summer from 0 °C to 20 °C, while winds are an almost everyday occurrence. Generally the temperature falls 1 °C per 200 m of altitude. As the altitude rises, the phenomena are more intense and the variations of temperature and humidity are often sudden.\n\nThe coastal northeast slopes of Olympus receive more rain than the continental northwest, so, as a result, there is a clear difference in vegetation, being more abundant in the first of them. Hottest month is August, while coldest is February.\n\nThe mountain's highest zone, over 2,000 metres, is snowcapped for about nine months (September to May). In some places the winds gather snow, 8–10 metres thick (\"anemosouria\" in Greek), while in some deep ravines the snow is maintained all over the year (everlasting snow). For this Olympus' alpine region, recordings have been made in the 1960s in the highest-altitude weather station in Greece, that was established on the summit of Aghios Antonios (2,815 m), providing a number of interesting data for the mountain's climate. Τhe average temperature is −5 °C in winter and 10 °C in summer. The average annual precipitation heights vary from 149 cm at Prionia (1,100 m) to 170 cm at Aghios Antonios, about half of them rainfall and hailstorms in summer and the rest snowfall in winter. The weather may change several times in the same day. In summer rainfalls are frequent, commonly as evening thunderstorms, many times accompanied by hail and strong winds. However water springs over 2,000 metres are scarce and visitors should ensure that they have always water and of course the necessary clothing for any weather conditions.\n\nThe research of Olympus' plants started in 1836, when the French botanist Aucher-Éloy studied them. According to this and later studies, the National Park of Olympus is considered one of the richest flora regions in Greece, with about 1,700 species and subspecies, that represent some 25% of Greek flora. Of them 187 are characterized as significant, 56 are Greek endemic and of them 23 are local endemic, i.e. they can be found only in Olympus, and 16 are rare in Greece or/and have there the limits of their spread within Northern Greece.\n\nAn important book about the plants and flowers, from the beach of the agean sea up to the upper regions, of Mount Olympus was written in 1980 by the Swedish botanist Arne Strid.\n\nMost of those found in lower altitude are the common Mediterranean and central European species. Jankaea heldreichii, a plant relic of the Ice age, is of particular interest for the botanists. Τhe intense diversity of the landscape, the varying orientation of the slopes and their position in relation to the sea affect locally Olympus' climate and so a local microclimate prevails, combined with the geological background and the soil favor the growth of particular vegetation types and biotopes. Generally Olympus' northeast side is densely forested, as it receives the most rainfall, while the southwest one has significantly sparser vegetation. Moreover, there is a clear sequence of the vegetation zones in accordance to altitude, in Olympus there is no such a regularity. It is due to the great microclimate variety, caused by the region's landscape.\n\nIn Olympus there are generally four sequent flora zones, but not clearly separated:\n\nIn the altitude between 300 and 500 metres occurs the evergreen broadleaf trees' zone (maquis). Along with oak (Quercus ilex) and Greek strawberry tree there occur kermes oak, strawberry tree, Phillyrea latifolia, bay laurel, cedar and others. Of the deciduous species most common are flaxinus ulmus, Montpellier maple, Judas tree, terebinth, Cotinus coggygria and others.\n\nThe evergreen broadleaf trees' zone is gradually replaced by ecosystems of European black pine, that forms compact clusters, with no intermediate zone of deciduous oaks, although trees of these species occur sporadically within clusters of black pine. On the northern slopes of Xirolakos valley, at altitude between 600 and 700 metres, there is a high forest of downy oak of about 120 hectares.\n\nΤhe black pine dominates on the eastern and northern side of the mountain, between 500 and 1,700 metres. In this zone there is also hybrid fir in small groups and scrubs or small clumps, particularly in the lower region and in the sites Naoumi (west) and Stalamatia and Polykastro (east), where it is mixed with black pine and Bosnian pine. In this zone there is also beech. While in the neighboring mountains Pierians and Ossa it creates an extended vegetation zone, in Olympus it is restricted to small clusters, appearing as islets, mainly in more humid locations and the best soils. A particularly rich variety of trees and shrubs is found in Enipeas' gorge. One can see there elm, cherry plum, European yew, hazel, holly, cornus mas, manna ash, maple and a considerable variety of herbaceous plants. Gorges and ravines are covered by oriental planes, willows, black alders and riverside greenery.\n\nTypical species of this zone is Bosnian pine. This rare kind of pine occurs sporadically higher than 1,000 metres and gradually replaces the black pine, while over 1,400 metres it creates an almost unmixed forest. Οver 2,000 metres the forest becomes sparser, reaching to 2,750 metres, thus creating the highest forest limit (highest limit of forest growth) in the Balkans, or even in Europe. Another feature of this zone is that over 2,500 metres the trees appear in a crawling form. The region, where Bosnian pine grows, is mostly dry and its slopes are rocky. There are no springs or water streams. The vegetation growing there is adapted to specific local conditions and represented by typical shrubs, graminaceous, chasmophytes etc., while the flora includes many endemic species of the Balkans.\n\nBeyond Bosnian pine's zone follows an extensive zone, without trees, with alpine meadows, consisted by a mosaic of grassland ecosystems, depending on the topography, the slope and the orientation of the ground. In general, this alpine flora with more than 150 plant species, contains snow accumulation meadows, grassy swamps, alpine scree and rock crevices. On the meadows, the rocks and the steep slopes live most of the endemic Olympus' plants, among them some of the most beautiful wildflowers in Greece. Half of them are found only in the Balkans and 23 only in Olympus and nowhere else.\n\nThe list of 23 local endemic plants at Mount Olympus from the Olympus National Park Management Agency:\n\n\"Achillea ambrosiaca, Alyssum handelii, Asprerula muscosa, Aubrieta thessala, Campanula oreadum, Carum adamovicii, Centaurea incompleta, Centaurea litochorea, Centaurea transiens, Cerastrium theophrasti, Coincla nivalis, Erysimum olympicum, Festuca olympica, Genista sakellariadis, Jankaea heldreichii, Ligusticum olympicum, Melampyrus ciliatum, Ophrys helenae\" (\"Ophrys sphegodes\" subsp. \"helenae\"), \"Poa thessala, Potentilla deorum, Rynchosinapis nivalis, Silene dionysii, Silene oligantha, Veronica thessalica, Viola striis-notata, Viola pseudograeca\".\n\nΟlympus' fauna, that has not been systematically studied so far, includes considerable variety and is marked by important, rare and endangered species. Large mammals, that lived formerly in the region, like deer, have disappeared. In ancient times there were lions (Pausanias), while at least until the 16th century there were bears (Life of St. Dionysios the Later).\n\nThere have been recorded 32 species of mammals, including wild goat (Rυρicapra rupicapra balcanica), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), wildcat (Felis sylvestris), beech marten (Martes foina), red fox (vulpes vulpes) and red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). There have also been detected 108 species of birds (like sparrowhawk, cinereous vulture, rock partridge, white stork, rock dove, European robin, lanner falcon, peregrine falcon, tree falcon, golden eagle, short-toed snake eagle, booted eagle and hoopoe). Many of them, particularly the birds of prey, are scarce. In addition there are the common reptiles of Greek fauna (22 species like snakes, turtles, lizards, etc.) and some amphibians (8 species) in streams and seasonal ponds, as well as a great variety of insects, particularly butterflies.\n\nGreece's highest mountain, dwelling of the Twelve Gods of antiquity, has been the first region in the country to be applied specific protective rules, by its declaration as a National Park in 1938. The aim of this declaration was \"...the preservation in perpetuity of the natural environment of the region, i.e. of wild flora, fauna and natural landscape, as well as its cultural and other values...\". In addition the declaration has aimed promoting scientific research along with environmental education for the public and tourist development in the region. Specific laws prohibit all forms of exploitation on the eastern side of the mountain in an area of about 4,000 hectares, that is the core of the Park. A wider region, around this core, has been designated \"peripheral zone of the National Park\", so that its managing and exploitation to be done so as not to adversely affect the core's protection. At present, the park has been expanded to 24,000 hectares. Administratively it belongs to Pieria's and Larissa's Prefectures and specifically to the municipalities Diou-Olympou and Katerinis (Pieria) and Τempon and Elassonas (Larissa). Its lowest altitude is 600 metres and its peak, Mytikas, at 2,918 metres. In 1981 UNESCO proclaimed Olympus \"Biosphere Reserve\". European Union has listed Olympus in the \"Significant for Birdlife Regions of European Union\". It is also registered in the list of Natura 2000 European Network as a special protection area and a site of community interest.\n\nIn June 2016 the Olympus National Park Information Center, located at Litochoro, opened its gates. It informs their visitors about geologie, archaeological sites, mythology, monasteries, plants, animals and other subjects affecting Mount Olympus. Hikers will find help from professional rangers, a guide provides tours for groups in the mountain area.\n\nThe Park is protected by specific legislation. Under the \"Special Regulation\" entrance to the Park is allowed only by the existing roads and traffic is allowed from sunrise to sunset only on formed paths. The visitor should also know that the following activities are not allowed:\n\n\nOlympus' massif is found about in the middle of Continental Greece and is easy to approach from the national railway network on the Athens-Thessaloniki line and the secondary roads that connect towns and villages around the mountain, with the principal base for excursions being the town of Litochoro, where there are many hotels and taverns. In addition, on Pieria's coastal zone there are many camp sites and lodgings. The nearest international airport is that of Thessaloniki, and railway stations are those of Litochoro, Katerini and Leptokarya. There is frequent service by KTEL buses and a taxi stand is in Litochoro's central square.\n\nMap for an overview: More detailed map of the Olympos region:\n\n\n\nThe official list of the refuges at Mount Olympus is maintained by the Olympus National Park Management Agency.\n\nSince 2010 exists the Olympus Alpine Biblioteca. It houses a collection of books and texts around the subject Mount Olympus. Currently over 300 titles are listed, many of them available for free download. \n\nMount Olympus and the national Park around it were selected as the main motif for the Greek National Park Olympus commemorative coin, minted in 2005. On the reverse, the War of the Titans on Mount Olympus is portrayed along with flowering branches on the lower part of the coin. Above the scene is written, in Greek, \"National Park Olympus\".\n\n\n"}

It is a partial differential equation for the vertical velocity, formula_1, which is defined as the Lagrangian rate of change of pressure with time. Mathematically, formula_2, where formula_3 represents a material derivative. It is valid for large scale flows under the conditions of quasi-geostrophy and hydrostatic balance. In fact, one may consider the vertical velocity that results from solving the omega equation as that which is needed to maintain quasi-geostrophy and hydrostasy.\nThe equation reads:\n\nwhere formula_4 is the Coriolis parameter, formula_5 is related to the static stability, formula_6 is the geostrophic velocity vector, formula_7 is the geostrophic relative vorticity, formula_8 is the geopotential, formula_9 is the horizontal Laplacian operator and formula_10 is the horizontal del operator.\n\nThe derivation of the formula_1 equation is based on the vorticity equation and the thermodynamic equation. The vorticity equation for a frictionless atmosphere may be written using pressure as the vertical coordinate:\n\nHere formula_12 is the relative vorticity, formula_13 the horizontal wind velocity vector, whose components in the formula_14 and formula_15 directions are formula_16 and formula_17 respectively, formula_18 the absolute vorticity, formula_19 the Coriolis parameter, formula_2 the material derivative of pressure formula_21. formula_22 is the unit vertical vector, formula_23 is the isobaric Del (grad) operator, formula_24 is the vertical \nadvection of vorticity and formula_25 represents the transformation of horizontal vorticity into vertical vorticity.\n\nThe thermodynamic equation may be written as:\n\nwhere formula_26, in which formula_27 is the supply of heat per unit-time and mass, formula_28the specific heat of dry air, formula_29 the gas constant for dry air, formula_30 is the potential temperature and formula_31 is geopotential formula_32. \n\nThe formula_1 equation () is then obtained from equation () and () by substituting values:\nand\n\ninto (), which gives:\n\nDifferentiating () with respect to formula_21 gives:\n\nTaking the Laplacian (formula_37) of () gives:\n\nAdding () and (), simplifying and substituting formula_38, gives:\n\nEquation () is now a linear differential equation in formula_1, such that it can be split into two part, namely formula_40 and formula_41, such that:\n\nand\n\nwhere formula_40 is the vertical velocity due to the mean baroclinicity in the atmosphere and formula_41 is the vertical velocity due to the non-adiabatic heating, which includes the latent heat of condensation, sensible heat radiation, etc. (Singh & Rathor, 1974).\n\nPhysically, the omega equation combines the effects of vertical differential of geostrophic absolute vorticity advection (first term on the right-hand side) and three-dimensional Laplacian of thickness thermal advection (second term on the right-hand side) and determines the resulting vertical motion (as expressed by the dependent variable formula_1.)\n\nThe above equation is used by meteorologists and operational weather forecasters to assess development from synoptic charts. In rather simple terms, positive vorticity advection (or PVA for short) and no thermal advection results in a negative formula_1, that is, ascending motion. Similarly, warm advection (or WA for short) also results in a negative formula_1 corresponding to ascending motion. Negative vorticity advection (NVA) or cold advection (CA) both result in a positive formula_1 corresponding to descending motion.\n\n"}
{"id": "680955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=680955", "title": "Palouse", "text": "Palouse\n\nThe Palouse ( ) is a distinct geographic region of the northwestern United States, encompassing parts of north central Idaho, southeastern Washington, and, by some definitions, parts of northeast Oregon. It is a major agricultural area, primarily producing wheat and legumes. Situated about north of the Oregon Trail, the region experienced rapid growth in the late 19th century and was once Washington's most populous region, surpassing even the Puget Sound area.\n\nThe Palouse is home to two land-grant universities, the University of Idaho in Moscow and Washington State University in Pullman. Just eight miles (13 km) apart, both schools opened in the early 1890s.\nThe origin of the name \"Palouse\" is unclear. One theory is that the name of the Palus tribe (spelled in early accounts variously as Palus, Palloatpallah, Pelusha, etc.) was converted by French-Canadian fur traders to the more familiar French word \"pelouse\", meaning \"land with short and thick grass\" or \"lawn.\" Over time, the spelling changed to Palouse. Another theory is that the region's name came from the French word and was later applied to its indigenous inhabitants.\n\nTraditionally, the Palouse region was defined as the fertile hills and prairies north of the Snake River, which separated it from Walla Walla County, and north of the Clearwater River, which separated it from the Camas Prairie, extending north along the Washington and Idaho border, south of Spokane, centered on the Palouse River. This region underwent a settlement and wheat-growing boom during the 1880s, part of a larger process of growing wheat in southeast Washington, originally pioneered in Walla Walla County south of the Snake River.\n\nWhile this definition of the Palouse remains common today, the term is sometimes used to refer to the entire wheat-growing region, including Walla Walla County, the Camas Prairie of Idaho, the Big Bend region of the central Columbia River Plateau, and other smaller agricultural districts such as Asotin County, Washington, and Umatilla County, Oregon. This larger definition is used by organizations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature, who define the Palouse Grasslands ecoregion broadly.\n\nThe community of Palouse, Washington, is located in Whitman County, about 7 miles (11 km) west of Potlatch, Idaho.\n\nNevertheless, the traditional definition of the Palouse region is distinct from the older Walla Walla region south of the Snake River, where dryland farming of wheat was first proved viable in the region in the 1860s. During the 1870s, the Walla Walla region was rapidly converted to farmland, while the initial experiments in growing wheat began in the Palouse region, which previously had been the domain of cattle and sheep ranching. When those trials proved more than successful, a minor land rush quickly filled the Palouse region with farmers during the 1880s. The simultaneous proliferation of railroads only increased the rapid settlement of the Palouse. By 1890 nearly all the Palouse lands had been taken up and converted to wheat farming.\n\nUnlike the Walla Walla Country, which was solidly anchored on the city of Walla Walla, the Palouse region saw the rise of at least four centers, all within several miles of each other: Colfax (the oldest), Palouse, Pullman, and on the Idaho side, Moscow. These four centers, along with at least ten lesser ones, resulted in a diffuse pattern of rural centers, relative to the centralized Walla Walla county.\n\nCities along the borders of the Palouse, and by some definitions included within it, include Lewiston, Idaho, serving the Camas Prairie farmlands; Ritzville, serving the eastern edge of the Big Bend Country; and Spokane, the region's major urban hub. So dominant was Spokane's position that it became known as the capital of the Inland Empire, including all the wheat-producing regions, the local mining districts, and lumber-producing forests. Spokane also served as the region's main railroad and transportation hub.\n\nBy 1910, although local terms like Palouse, Walla Walla Country, Big Bend, Umatilla Country, and Camas Prairie continued to be common, many people of the region began to regard themselves as living in the Inland Empire, the Wheat Belt, the Columbia Basin, or simply Eastern Washington, Oregon, or North Idaho.\n\nThe peculiar and picturesque loess hills which characterize the Palouse Prairie are underlain by wind-blown sediments of the Palouse Loess that covers the surface of over on the Columbia Plateau in southeastern Washington, western Idaho, and northeastern Oregon. The Palouse Loess forms a fine-grained mantle of variable thickness that lies upon either the Miocene Columbia River Basalt Group, non-glacial Pliocene fluvial sediments of the Ringold Formation, or Pleistocene glacial outburst flood sediments that are known informally as the \"Hanford formation.\" At its thickest, the Palouse Loess is up to thick. It consists of multiple layers of loess separated by multiple well-defined calcrete paleosols and erosional unconformities. The degree of development of individual layers of calcrete together with thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence dating of the loess indicate that each calcrete layer represents a period of thousands to tens of thousands of years of nondeposition, weathering, and soil development that occurred between episodic periods of loess deposition. A consistent sequence of normal-reverse-normal polarity signatures demonstrates that the older layers of loess accumulated between 2 and 1 million years ago. Detailed optically stimulated luminescence dating has shown that the uppermost layer of Palouse Loess accumulated between 15,000 years ago and modern times and the layer of loess underlying it accumulated episodically between about 77,000 and 16,000 years ago. Regional trends in the distribution, thickness, texture, and overall composition of the Palouse Loess indicate that it largely consists of the wind-blown sediments eroded from fine-grained deposits of the Hanford formation that were periodically deposited by repeated Missoula Floods within the Eureka Flats area.\n\nAlthough superficially resembling sand or other types of dunes, the loess hills of the Palouse are of far different origin. Internally, they lack any evidence of cross-bedding or erosion of interbedded layers of loess and calcrete that characterize dunes formed by moving currents. Instead, these hills consist of alternating layers of loess and calcrete that are more or less concordant with the modern surface of these hills. This layering demonstrates that the Palouse hills loess accumulated from the airfall of wind-silt from suspension. In addition, the ubiquitous homogenization of the loess by innumerable plant roots and insect burrows as it accumulated further supports the conclusion drawn from numerous thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence dates that individual layers of loess accumulated over an extended period of time in terms of thousands of years. Finally, the calcrete horizons are paleosols that represent the periodic cessation of loess accumulation for periods of thousands of years during which they formed within the surface of a loess layer.\n\nEarly farming was extremely labor-intensive and relied heavily on human and horse-power. An organized harvesting/threshing team in the 1920s required 120 men and 320 mules and horses. Teams moved from farm to farm as the crops ripened. By this point, the combine had been invented and was in use, but few farmers had enough horses to pull such a machine, which required a crew of 40 horses and six men to operate on level ground. Because of this, use of combines on the Palouse lagged behind use in other farming communities in the United States.\n\nIt was only when the Idaho Harvester Company in Moscow began to manufacture a smaller machine that combine harvesting became feasible. By 1930, 90% of all Palouse wheat was harvested using combines.\n\nThe next step in mechanization was development of the tractor. As with the combines, the first steam engine and gasoline-powered tractors were too heavy and awkward for use on the steep Palouse hills. The smaller, general use tractors introduced in the 1920s were only marginally used. As a result, by 1930, only 20% of Palouse farmers used tractors.\n\nToday, the Palouse region is the most important lentil-growing region in the USA.\n\nOnce an extensive prairie composed of mid-length perennial grasses such as Bluebunch wheatgrass (\"Agropyron spicatum\") and Idaho fescue (\"Festuca idahoensis\"), today virtually all of the Palouse Prairie is planted in agricultural crops. The native prairie is one of the most endangered ecosystems in the United States (Noss et al. 1995), as only a little over one percent of the original prairie still exists.\n\nPeople have taken their toll on wildlife. Birds and small mammals, once abundant, are now few. The intensive roadbed-to-roadbed farming currently practiced across the Palouse leaves few fences and fewer fencerows. Many intermittent streams have been plowed over; many perennial streams with large wet meadows adjacent to them are now intermittent or deeply incised.\n\nRiparian areas offer breeding habitat for a greater diversity of birds than any other habitat in the U.S. (Ratti and Scott 1991). Loss of trees and shrubs along stream corridors means fewer birds and eventually fewer species. The majority of riparian areas have been lost across the bioregion.\nLately, conversion of agricultural lands to suburban homesites on large plots invites a new suite of biodiversity onto the Palouse Prairie. University of Idaho wildlife professor J. Ratti documented changes in bird community composition over a 10-year period as he converted a wheat field into a suburban wildlife refuge. As of 1991, his yard attracted 86 species of birds, an increase from 18 (Ratti and Scott 1991).\n\nIntensification of agriculture has affected both water quantity and quality. Agriculture has changed the hydrograph, increasing peak runoff flows and shortening the length of runoff. The result is more intense erosion and loss of perennial prairie streams. As early as the 1930s soil scientists were noting significant downcutting of regional rivers (Victor 1935) and expansion of channel width. Higher faster runoff caused streams to downcut quickly, effectively lowering the water table in immediately adjacent meadows. On the South Palouse River, this process was so efficient that by 1900 farming was possible where it had been too wet previously (Victor 1935). Replacement of perennial grasses with annual crops resulted in more overland flow and less infiltration, which translates at a watershed level to higher peak flows that subside more quickly than in the past. Once perennial prairie streams are now often dry by mid-summer. This has undoubtedly influenced the amphibious and aquatic species.\n\nAs population grew, towns and cities appeared changing the complexion of the area. By 1910, there were 22,000 people scattered in 30 communities across the Palouse Prairie.\n\nCrop production increased dramatically (200–400%) after the introduction of fertilizer following World War II.\n\nSince 1900, 94% of the grasslands and 97% of the wetlands in the Palouse ecoregion have been converted to crop, hay, or pasture lands. Approximately 63% of the lands in forest cover in 1900 are still forested, 9% are grass, and 7% are regenerating forestlands or shrublands. The remaining 21% of previously forested lands have been converted to agriculture or urban areas.\nThe impacts of domestic grazers on the grasslands of the Palouse and Camas Prairies was transitory because much of the areas were rapidly converted to agriculture. However, the canyonlands of the Snake and Clearwater rivers and their tributaries with their much shallower soils, steep topography, and hotter, drier climate, were largely unsuitable for crop production and were consequently used for a much longer period by grazing domestic animals (Tisdale 1986). There, intense grazing and other disturbances have resulted in irreversible changes with the native grasses largely replaced by annual grasses of the genus Bromus and noxious weeds, particularly from the genus Centaurea. The highly competitive plants of both of these genera evolved under similar climatic regimes in Eurasia and were introduced to the U.S. in the late 19th century.\n\nWith the adoption of no-till farming practices in the Palouse region in the early 2000s, the negative environmental impact of agriculture has visibly decreased.\n\nWhile there is some debate over how frequently the Palouse prairie burned historically, there is consensus that fires are generally less frequent today than in the past, primarily due to fire suppression, construction of roads (which serve as barriers to fire spread) and conversion of grass and forests to cropland (Morgan et al. 1996). Historians recount lightning-ignited fires burning in the pine fringes bordering the prairies in late autumn, but the extent to which forest fires spread into the prairie or the converse is not known. Some fire ecologists believe the Nez Perce burned the Palouse and Camas Prairies to encourage growth of Camas (Morgan, pers. Comm); but there is little historical record to solve the mystery. European-American settlers used fire to clear land for settlement and grazing until the 1930s. Since then, forest fires have become less common. One result has been increasing tree density on forested lands and encroachment of shrubs and trees into previously open areas. Consequently, when fires occur in the forest, they are more likely to result in mixed severity or stand replacing events.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23291", "title": "Pliocene", "text": "Pliocene\n\nThe Pliocene (; also Pleiocene) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years BP. It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene.\n\nAs with other older geologic periods, the geological strata that define the start and end are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain. The boundaries defining the Pliocene are not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer Miocene and the relatively cooler Pliocene. The upper boundary was set at the start of the Pleistocene glaciations.\n\nCharles Lyell (later Sir Charles) gave the Pliocene its name in \"Principles of Geology\" (volume 3, 1833).\n\nThe word \"pliocene\" comes from the Greek words (, \"more\") and (, \"new\" or \"recent\") and means roughly \"continuation of the recent\", referring to the essentially modern marine mollusc fauna.\n\nH.W. Fowler called the term \"Pliocene\" (like other geological jargon such as \"pleistocene\" and \"miocene\") a \"regrettable barbarism\" and an indication that even \"a good classical scholar\" such as Lyell should have requested a philologist's help when coining words.\n\nTo summarize the usage of these \"regrettable barbarisms\" in the labelling of the Cenozoic (\"recent life\") era (from youngest to oldest):\n\nwith the understanding that these are all \"new\" relative to the Mesozoic (\"middle life\" - the age of dinosaurs) and Paleozoic (\"old life\" - Trilobites, coal forests, and the earliest Synapsida) eras.\n\nIn the official timescale of the ICS, the Pliocene is subdivided into two stages. From youngest to oldest they are:\n\n\nThe Piacenzian is sometimes referred to as the Late Pliocene, whereas the Zanclean is referred to as the Early Pliocene.\n\nIn the system of\n\nIn the Paratethys area (central Europe and parts of western Asia) the Pliocene contains the Dacian (roughly equal to the Zanclean) and Romanian (roughly equal to the Piacenzian and Gelasian together) stages. As usual in stratigraphy, there are many other regional and local subdivisions in use.\n\nIn Britain the Pliocene is divided into the following stages (old to young): Gedgravian, Waltonian, Pre-Ludhamian, Ludhamian, Thurnian, Bramertonian or Antian, Pre-Pastonian or Baventian, Pastonian and Beestonian. In the Netherlands the Pliocene is divided into these stages (old to young): Brunssumian C, Reuverian A, Reuverian B, Reuverian C, Praetiglian, Tiglian A, Tiglian B, Tiglian C1-4b, Tiglian C4c, Tiglian C5, Tiglian C6 and Eburonian. The exact correlations between these local stages and the ICS stages is still a matter of detail.\n\nThe global average temperature in the mid-Pliocene (3.3–3 mya) was 2–3 °C higher than today, carbon dioxide levels were the same as today, and global sea level was 25 m higher. The northern hemisphere ice sheet was ephemeral before the onset of extensive glaciation over Greenland that occurred in the late Pliocene around 3 Ma.\nThe formation of an Arctic ice cap is signaled by an abrupt shift in oxygen isotope ratios and ice-rafted cobbles in the North Atlantic and North Pacific ocean beds. Mid-latitude glaciation was probably underway before the end of the epoch. The global cooling that occurred during the Pliocene may have spurred on the disappearance of forests and the spread of grasslands and savannas.\n\nContinents continued to drift, moving from positions possibly as far as 250 km from their present locations to positions only 70 km from their current locations. South America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene, making possible the Great American Interchange and bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive large marsupial predator and native ungulate faunas. The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAfrica's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea, cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean. The border between the Miocene and the Pliocene is also the time of the Messinian salinity crisis.\n\nSea level changes exposed the land bridge between Alaska and Asia (Beringia).\n\nPliocene marine rocks are well exposed in the Mediterranean, India, and China. Elsewhere, they are exposed largely near shores.\n\nThe change to a cooler, dry, seasonal climate had considerable impacts on Pliocene vegetation, reducing tropical species worldwide. Deciduous forests proliferated, coniferous forests and tundra covered much of the north, and grasslands spread on all continents (except Antarctica). Tropical forests were limited to a tight band around the equator, and in addition to dry savannahs, deserts appeared in Asia and Africa.\n\nBoth marine and continental faunas were essentially modern, although continental faunas were a bit more primitive than today. The first recognizable hominins, the australopithecines, appeared in the Pliocene.\n\nThe land mass collisions meant great migration and mixing of previously isolated species, such as in the Great American Interchange. Herbivores got bigger, as did specialized predators.\n\nIn North America, rodents, large mastodons and gomphotheres, and opossums continued successfully, while hoofed animals (ungulates) declined, with camel, deer and horse all seeing populations recede. Rhinos, three toed horses (\"Nannippus\"), oreodonts, protoceratids, and chalicotheres became extinct. Borophagine dogs and \"Agriotherium\" became extinct, but other carnivores including the weasel family diversified, and dogs and short-faced bears did well. Ground sloths, huge glyptodonts, and armadillos came north with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama.\n\nIn Eurasia rodents did well, while primate distribution declined. Elephants, gomphotheres and stegodonts were successful in Asia, and hyraxes migrated north from Africa. Horse diversity declined, while tapirs and rhinos did fairly well. Cows and antelopes were successful, and some camel species crossed into Asia from North America. Hyenas and early saber-toothed cats appeared, joining other predators including dogs, bears and weasels.\nAfrica was dominated by hoofed animals, and primates continued their evolution, with australopithecines (some of the first hominins) appearing in the late Pliocene. Rodents were successful, and elephant populations increased. Cows and antelopes continued diversification and overtaking pigs in numbers of species. Early giraffes appeared. Horses and modern rhinos came onto the scene. Bears, dogs and weasels (originally from North America) joined cats, hyenas and civets as the African predators, forcing hyenas to adapt as specialized scavengers.\n\nSouth America was invaded by North American species for the first time since the Cretaceous, with North American rodents and primates mixing with southern forms. Litopterns and the notoungulates, South American natives, were mostly wiped out, except for the macrauchenids and toxodonts, which managed to survive. Small weasel-like carnivorous mustelids, coatis and short-faced bears migrated from the north. Grazing glyptodonts, browsing giant ground sloths and smaller caviomorph rodents, pampatheres, and armadillos did the opposite, migrating to the north and thriving there.\n\nThe marsupials remained the dominant Australian mammals, with herbivore forms including wombats and kangaroos, and the huge \"Diprotodon\". Carnivorous marsupials continued hunting in the Pliocene, including dasyurids, the dog-like thylacine and cat-like \"Thylacoleo\". The first rodents arrived in Australia. The modern platypus, a monotreme, appeared.\n\nThe predatory South American phorusrhacids were rare in this time; among the last was \"Titanis\", a large phorusrhacid that migrated to North America and rivaled mammals as top predator. Other birds probably evolved at this time, some modern, some now extinct.\n\nAlligators and crocodiles died out in Europe as the climate cooled. Venomous snake genera continued to increase as more rodents and birds evolved. Rattlesnakes first appeared in the Pliocene. The modern species \"Alligator mississippiensis\", having evolved in the Miocene, continued into the Pliocene, except with a more northern range; specimens have been found in very late Miocene deposits of Tennessee. Giant tortoises still thrived in North America, with genera like \"Hesperotestudo\". Madtsoid snakes were still present in Australia. The amphibian order Allocaudata became extinct.\n\nOceans continued to be relatively warm during the Pliocene, though they continued cooling. The Arctic ice cap formed, drying the climate and increasing cool shallow currents in the North Atlantic. Deep cold currents flowed from the Antarctic.\n\nThe formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 3.5 million years ago cut off the final remnant of what was once essentially a circum-equatorial current that had existed since the Cretaceous and the early Cenozoic. This may have contributed to further cooling of the oceans worldwide.\n\nThe Pliocene seas were alive with sea cows, seals, sea lions and sharks.\n\nIn 2002, Narciso Benítez \"et al.\" calculated that roughly 2 million years ago, around the end of the Pliocene epoch, a group of bright O and B stars called the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association passed within 130 light-years of Earth and that one or more supernova explosions gave rise to a feature known as the Local Bubble. Such a close explosion could have damaged the Earth's ozone layer and caused the extinction of some ocean life (at its peak, a supernova of this size could have the same absolute magnitude as an entire galaxy of 200 billion stars).\n\n\n\n"}

(\"Belvidere\" means \"beautiful to behold\" in the Italian language.) This 300-year-old tree is believed to have served as a gathering place for pow wows held by the Native American Wamesit tribe. (\"Wamesit\" is an Algonquian word meaning: \"a cornucopia of plenty for all.\") The Wamesit Indians congregated in this area for thousands of years, and the land on which this tree grew on (which was high ground with an underground spring close by) was held as sacred to them as was the tree itself. It is also said that Revolutionary War soldiers such as Deacon Thomas Clark, Captain John Trull, and General Joseph Varnum, as well as others from this New England hamlet, traveled past the Pow-Wow Oak on their way to defend Lexington and Concord on Patriots Day, April 19, 1775. This was the very beginning of the American Revolution, which started in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1909, Middlesex County decided to pave Clark Road, then a dirt and gravel road that was referred to as \"The Old Bridal Path\". Albert E. O'Heir, an immigrant from Canada, who lived in the old Hunt Home at 241 Clark Road, did not want to see the tree, which stood in the middle of the road, cut down. In order that the tree might stand, O'Heir donated for one cent to the City of Lowell, \"9,463 square feet\" of his land on Clark Road.\n\nIn May 1931, the Molly Varnum Chapter of the Massachusetts Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) erected a sign next to the tree to commemorate the ancient oak, the Wamesit Indians, and the local militia who passed by it while traveling through that Lowell neighborhood (then still part of the town of Tewksbury) during the Revolutionary War.\nIn September, 2009, a local, grass-roots, neighborhood, environmental organization called the Pow-Wow Oak Protectors (a registered, non-profit, public-charity), founded by George Nicholas Koumantzelis, was formed to ensure the continued safety of the tree, as it had been encroached upon for decades, doing damage to its health. In May 2011, local groups, including a current chapter of the Old Concord DAR and the Pow-Wow Oak Protectors, raised funds to have the tree's commemorative sign refurbished. The Pow-Wow Oak has also been recognized and preserved by the American Forests Historic Trees Program, and by the City of Lowell via the Pow Wow Oak Tree Preservation Covenant, which was recorded on March 12, 2012, at the Middlesex (North District) Registry of Deeds, Book 25799, Page 105.\n\nIn May 2011, a documentary movie called \"The Last Pow-Wow Oak\" about the Pow-Wow Oak and the crusade to save it by the Pow-Wow Oak Protectors, as well as other, local, concerned groups, was produced and released by local artist, musician, film maker, and documentarian, Andrew Szava-Kovats. In March 2014, an accompanying book (with the same title) to the movie, including more detailed legal documents and historical data about the whole Pow-Wow Oak saga, was written and produced by Andrew Szava-Kovats.\n\nOn May 21, 2013, during a very strong wind storm, a large upper branch (not the lower horizontal \"arm\" that pointed west) of the Pow-Wow Oak collapsed onto nearby Clark Road. The following day, the decision was made by the City Manager's Office of the City of Lowell to, questionably, cut down the \"entire tree\" to the ground because extensive interior decay in the mid to upper sections of the tree had more than partially compromised the tree and the safety of pedestrians and nearby motorists.\n\nOn Thursday, November 12, 2015, a dedication ceremony was held at the Peter W. Reilly Elementary School on Douglas Road in Lowell, MA, commemorating the installation of a permanent display of a huge round piece of the trunk of the Pow-Wow Oak.\n\n"}
{"id": "3715622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3715622", "title": "Psychro Cave", "text": "Psychro Cave\n\nPsychro Cave () is an ancient Minoan sacred cave in Lasithi plateau in the Lasithi district of eastern Crete. Psychro is associated with the Diktaean Cave (Greek: \"Diktaion Antron\"), one of the putative sites of the birth of Zeus. Other legends place it as the Idaean Cave on Mount Ida. According to Hesiod, \"Theogony\" (477-484), Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Lyctus and hid him in a cave of Mount Aegaeon. Since the late nineteenth century the Diktaean Cave, which is above the modern village of Psychro, has been identified with this sanctuary.\n\nPsychro is 1,025 metres above sea level. The cave is located in the prefecture of Lasithi.\n\nThe Dictaean cave is famous in Greek mythology as the place where Amalthea, nurtured the infant Zeus with her goat's milk. The archaeology attests to the site's long use as a place of cult worship. The nurse of Zeus, who was charged by Rhea to raise the infant Zeus in secret here, to protect him from his father Cronus (Krónos) is also called the nymph Adrasteia in some contexts. It is one of a number of caves believed to have been the birthplace or hiding place of Zeus. The mountains, of which the cave are part, are known in Crete as Dikte.\n\nThe cave was first excavated in 1886 by Joseph Hatzidakis, President of the Syllogos at Candia, and F. Halbherr. In 1896, Sir Arthur Evans investigated the site.\n\nIn 1899, J. Demargne and David George Hogarth of the British School at Athens conducted further investigations; Hogarth's brief report published in 1900 gives a picture of the destruction wrought by primitive archaeological methods: immense fallen blocks from the upper cave roof were blasted before removal; the rich black earth had been previously ransacked. The stuccoed altar in the upper cave was discovered in 1900, surrounded by strata of ashes, pottery and \"other refuse\", among which were votive objects in bronze, terracotta, iron and bone, with fragments of some thirty libation tables and countless conical ceramic cups for food offerings. Bones among the ash layer attest to sacrifice of bulls, sheep and goats, deer and a boar.\n\nThe undisturbed lowest strata of the upper cave represented the transition between Late Minoan Kamares ware to earliest Mycenaean levels; finds represented the Geometric Style of the ninth century BCE, but few later than that. More recent excavation has revealed the use of the cave reached back to Early Minoan times, and votive objects attest to the cave's being the most frequented shrine by Middle Minoan times (MM IIIA).\n\nThe lower grotto falls steeply with traces of a rock-cut stair to a pool, out of which stalactites rise. \"Much earth had been thrown down by diggers of the Upper Grotto,\" Hogarth reported, \"and this was found full of small bronze objects.\" In the vertical chinks of the lowest stalactites, Hogarth's team found \"toy double-axes, knife-blades, needles, and other objects in bronze, placed there by dedicators, as in niches. The mud at the edge of the subterranean pool was also rich in similar things and in statuettes of two types, male and female and engraved gems.\"\n\nIn 1961, the art historian and archaeologist John Boardman published the finds uncovered by these and other excavations.\n\nWhile clay human figurines are normally found in peak sanctuaries, Psychro and the sanctuary on Mount Ida stand out as the only sacred caves that have yielded human figurines. Psychro is also a unique sacred cave for a bronze leg, also known as a votive body part, which is the only votive body part to be found in a sacred cave. More common sacred cave finds at Psychro include stone and ceramic lamps.\n\nPsychro yielded an uncommon number of semi-precious stones, including carnelian, steatite, amethyst, jasper and hematite.\n\nPsychro's artefacts are now on display at the Heraklion Museum, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the Louvre and the British Museum.\n\n\n"}

Constituent members include Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, United States Virgin Islands, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nThe creation of the SSEB can be traced to the Southern Governors Conference meeting in Point Clear, Alabama, which on October 20, 1955 approved the \"Point Clear Plan\" whereby Southern states would coordinate the possible development of civilian uses of nuclear energy in the region. The agreement led to Florida Governor LeRoy Collins convening a preliminary energy conference on January 25, 1956 in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Also attended by Tennessee Governor Frank Clement, representatives of fifteen Southern and Border states, as well as nuclear energy experts, additional meetings were held at Raleigh, North Carolina, Aiken, South Carolina and a March 1, 1956 meeting in Miami, Florida. Under the auspices of the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), Gov. Collins convened a \"Work Conference on Nuclear Energy\" at Redington Beach, Florida on August 1, 1956, which urged Southern governors to create \"statewide atomic energy citizens advisory committees\".\n\nThese efforts resulted in the creation of a \"Regional Advisory Council on Nuclear Energy\" (RACNE), which first convened in Atlanta on Feb. 1-2, 1957 with representatives from 14 states in attendance. Administrative support for the Council, originally provided by SREB, was transferred to the Council of State Governments's regional office.\n\nBy September 1961, with eight states having ratified a RACNE-drafted proposed interstate compact, RACNE became the \"Southern Interstate Nuclear Board\" (SINB), the precursor to the SSEB, which then was officially sanctioned by enactment of Public Law 87-563, filed by Senator Albert Gore, Sr., of Tennessee and signed into law by President John F.

Traditional varieties and ecotypes were sown in the diversified ecological regions of Italy until the introduction of Corn Belt hybrids in the twentieth century presented outstanding ecological adaptation, yield and cooking characteristics.\n\nMost Italian agro-ecotypes of maize are from the \"Indurata\" and \"Indentata\" sections and their combinations, characterized by kernels with flint, semi-dent and dent consistency.

{"id": "49505197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49505197", "title": "Truncated upland", "text": "Truncated upland\n\nA truncated upland, truncated highland or bevelled upland () is the heavily eroded remains of a fold mountain range, often from an early period in earth history. The term \"Rumpfgebirge\" (\"rump mountains\") was first introduced into the literature in 1886 by Ferdinand von Richthofen. The rumps of the former mountain ranges may be found in many lowland regions of the earth's crust (where they form the so-called basement rocks) and especially outcrop in Central Europe through more recent tectonics. This could result in an uplifted peneplain which is one type of truncated upland.\n\nThe valley structures of truncated uplands are often more irregular than in the younger fold mountains, which is due to the considerably younger tectonic processes and stronger erosion of the former mountain ranges that were originally often up to several thousand metres high. By contrast, their plateaux are orographically similar in shape. \n\nIn western Europe many of the Central Upland ranges fall into the category of truncated uplands - for example the Harz, the Ore Mountains, the Fichtel Mountains and the Rhenish Massif. Other ranges also date to the time of the Variscan orogeny, including those on either side of the Rhine, such as the Black Forest and Vosges and, from the Bavarian Forest in northeast Bavaria, through the Bohemian Forest in the Czech Republic to the Bohemian Massif in Austria and the Czech Republic, not to mention the French Massif Central. This mountain formation took place in the Middle Palaeozoic, during the Devonian and Carboniferous epochs about 350 to 250 million years ago. Already by the Permian the Variscan mountains had been eroded into the so-called Permian peneplain and overlain by sedimentary strata. These remains survive as Variscan \"islands\" between the younger sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic. During the course of subsequent earth history, fault block tectonics followed, which characterised the present appearance of the German Central Uplands. These truncated Variscan mountains are usually strongly affected by magmatic processes.\n\nThe erosion of the mountains exposed numerous mineral resources e.g. silver and iron ore in the Harz as well as copper (the Rammelsberg is a type locality for SEDEX deposits), or uranium in the Ore Mountains.\n\nEven older are the Caledonian Mountains of Scotland and the rest of the plateaux and coastal mountains in Scandinavia, which were formed about 500 million years ago.\n\nIn North America the almost 3,000-kilometre-long mountain chain of the Appalachians is one of the largest areas of truncated highland in the world. It extends in widths of 200 to 300 kilometre from the southern states of the United States to the east Canadian Newfoundland, but only reaches heights of just over 2,000 metres in the south. Many mineral deposits of coal, mineral oil and iron ore, as well as fertile plains make the range and its surrounding area into one of the richest regions of America.\n\nThe Urals between eastern Europe and Siberia have a similar importance in terms of mining and the economy; and the extent of these mountains in Russia, which are up to 1,900 metres high, is similar to that of the Appalachians.\n"}

While still in progress, the wind lens has a few changes in design which have led to impacts on how wind energy can be used and harnessed while changing how it impacts the world around us.\n\nAs the normal wind turbine does, the wind lens harnesses the energy of the wind but has a few modifications in order to increase efficiency as well as the impact on the environment.\n\nStudies have shown that the Wind Lens can have between two and five times more the output of power compared to the wind turbine due to the way it harnesses more wind.\n\nThe turbulence created as a result of the new configuration creates a low pressure zone behind the turbine, causing greater wind to pass through the turbine, and this, in turn, increases blade rotation and energy output. One way to get the most out of the wind input is by using a specially shaped tube around the blades. The tube, or shroud, is shaped as a diffuser which works like a magnifying glass for wind. The diffuser, which is smaller in the front and bigger in the back, catches more wind and focuses the wind towards the center blades which also leads to more efficient production of power.\n\nIn addition to the diffuser shape of the shroud, the back has a brim. This brim disturbs the wind flow which creates vortexes that cause a low pressure area to be formed behind the wind lens. The wind then flows to the low pressure area through the blades of the wind lens. The increased airflow through the blades leads to another reason of higher power production.\n\nThe diffuser shape and the brim combined creates more efficiently placed and accurate airflow. This results in a higher amount of energy that is produced.\n\nComplaints about the wind turbine include the effect on the bird population, sound production, and radar interference which limits all its placement in urban areas. The creators of the wind lens took a look at the problems and tried to solve them by adjusting the design.\n\nWind turbines have a detrimental effect on the bird population due to migration patterns and birds being caught and injured or even killed by the towering high speed blade. In order to fix this issue, the wind lens shroud that is around the blade, helps protect birds from entering the path of the blade and a mesh has been added to either end to prevent birds from being pulled into its blades. The addition of this mesh creates a negligible decrease in power production therefore having more benefits. In addition to the mesh, the wind lens is designed to avoid birds by making it a more compact and shorter, therefore making it possible for birds to easily fly over the wind lens unlike the wind turbine.\n\nWind lenses have been made such that it produces less sound than wind turbines, making it possible for placement in urban areas without disturbing residents. The design of the blade is made so the angle and shape of the blade is able to cut through the wind more silently.\n\nThe biggest cause of the sound in the conventional wind turbine is the air drag at the tips of the blades but now the tips of the blades are covered and the more of the wind is more focused towards the center of the blades due to the diffuser shroud which means the air drag at the tips of the blades are minimized.\n\nRadar interference is consistently a problem with wind turbines which causes different groups to be against the use of wind farms near urban areas. After studies were performed to test the radar interference of wind lenses compared to the wind turbine, the wind lens had significiantly less intereference because of the smaller more compact design of the shroud itself as well as the shape and make of the shroud making it less of a problem with radar interference.\n\nDespite the beneficial additions to the design, there are still limitations.\n\nThe wind lens requires far more materials compared to the current design of wind turbines. Such materials for the shroud as well as the mesh requires a great amount of energy and cost.\n\nWhile still producing less noise and interference, it will still cause disturbances until it becomes zero.\n\nThe wind load on the wind lens is higher and therefore may be too heavy for the wind lens to maintain due to structural challenges. This means it may have a lot of power unused or that the wind lens is more prone to breaking.\n\nThe idea is not anything new and previous testing has tried and failed, however other projects have never had large scale testing and have come to a stage this far with this much success.\n\nThe wind lens is being looked to as a way to increase the production of clean energy as well as an archetype for other types of clean energy.\n\nThe wind lens can replace the current production energy of fossil fuels which harms the environment and can be an alternative to the less efficient wind turbine since it is adaptable to more environments and produces higher amounts of energy.\n\nThe wind lens is currently being adjusted and approved by testing it in multiple ways and at multiple places.\n\n\n"}

The beach is a narrow spit of land, which forms a natural barrier between the fresh water delta of the Dalyan river and the Mediterranean. It is one of the main breeding grounds for loggerhead sea turtles (\"Caretta caretta\") in the Mediterranean and is therefore often referred to as \"Turtle Beach\". The loggerhead turtle (\"Caretta caretta\") is on the IUCN Red list of endangered animals. For this reason the beach has had a protected status since 1988 and is part of the Köyceğiz-Dalyan Special Environmental Protection Area.\n\nThe greatest threat to the survival of the loggerhead sea turtle is on these sandy beaches where its life begins. This has triggered an international conservation effort that began in the 1990s. The effort to protect loggerhead sea turtle eggs and to assure a safe breeding ground for this endangered species has made international headlines. This issue is one of the most critical items on Turkey's environmental agenda.\nFrom 1984 onwards there had been rumours about developing the beach for mass tourism. Plans were discussed for building a hotel and a marina at the delta side and bungalows at \"Küçük Dalyan\" at the banks of Sülüngür lake. \nIn 1986 the owners of the beach huts were summoned to clear and dismantle their huts by October that year. \nIn April 1987 the rumours about a hotel complex came true, when building started on the Kaunos Beach Hotel, an 1800-bed holiday resort to be financed with German development aid funds. \nSince this would have meant the end of an important nesting habitat for the loggerhead turtle, June Haimoff, together with fellow-environmentalists such as David Bellamy, Lily Venizelos, Günther Peter, Nergis Yazgan and Keith Corbett, launched a campaign to save the beach. \nThis started a grim international struggle between conservationists and developers. There were protests from -amongst others- the IUCN, Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund and the Zoologische Gesellschaft Frankfurt. \nEspecially in the Federal Republic of Germany the building project caused great indignation, because German DEG (Deutsche Finanzierungsgesellschaft für Beteiligungen in Entwicklungsländern) wanted to claim a fund of 5 million euros worth from public means under the pretense of \"development aid\".\nJune Haimoff approached the WWF, upon which Prince Philip -then president- asked the Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Özal for a moratorium, while awaiting an Environmental impact assessment. This request was granted and building temporarily stopped. In the meantime the German Federal Government decided against the use of funds for the hotel by DEG. In July 1988 the Turkish government decided against development and gave İztuzu beach and its hinterland the Special Environmental Protection Area status.\n\nJune Haimoff has narrated the struggle to preserve İztuzu beach as a nesting habitat in her autobiographical book \"Kaptan June and the Turtles\", that was first published in 1997. In 2001 a Turkish translation was published called \"Kaptan June ve Kaplumbağalar\".\n\nWith an average of some 300 nests per year, İztuzu Beach is one of the prime nesting habitats of the loggerhead turtle in the Mediterranean. \nTo prevent disturbance and disruption of the turtles and their nests, strict regulations have been imposed by the government since 1988:\nThese measures have proven to be successful, despite the enormous increase of tourism. The monitoring programme carried out from 1988 onwards, shows a stable population and even a slight increase of nests on the beach.\nEver since May 2009 there has been a turtle centre at the beach, run by the Biology Department of Pamukkale University. During the breeding season students and volunteers are involved in monitoring. They locate and count nests and protect them with cages to prevent predation. Injured turtles found on the beach or in the estuary are brought in for treatment and rehabilitation.\nIn February 2011 the \"Kaptan June Sea Turtle Conservation Foundation\" was established, a foundation whose mission is to protect sea turtles and their habitat. The former beach hut of conservationist June Haimoff has been brought back to İztuzu and has been transformed into a small museum. In May 2011 she was rewarded an MBE by Elizabeth II for her services to environmental conservation and the protection of endangered turtles in Turkey.\n\nIn the period from 1988 onwards the Köyceğiz-Dalyan region has become a popular holiday destination. İztuzu Beach is frequented, both by people living or staying in Dalyan and by day tourists from e.g. Marmaris and Sarıgerme. In 2008 İztuzu Beach was proclaimed winner in the category \"Best Open Space (Europe)\" by \"The Times\" because of the eco-friendly exploitation of the beach.:\nIn 2011 Dalyan and İztuzu Beach were proclaimed \"Best Beach Destination of Europe\" by Dutch holiday assessment website Zoover.\n\n\n"}
