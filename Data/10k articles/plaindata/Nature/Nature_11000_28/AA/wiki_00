The word \"Caipora\" comes from tupi and means \"inhabitant of the forest\".\n\nIt is represented as a dark-skinned, small Indian, naked with a very long black mane, smoking a cigar and very mischievous. Sometimes Caipora is depicted as a girl and other times as a boy. The representation of the creature varies among the different regions of Brazil, and is sometimes confused with Curupira, which is another mythological creature who protects the forest. Curupira is often depicted as a boy with red hair, who has his feet turned backwards in order to deceive trackers.\n\nIn some regions, the indigenous tribes believed that the Caipora was afraid of the light. For this reason, they would walk around the forest protecting themselves using firebrands. Some say it rides a great peccary holding a stick. In some other areas of Brazil, the Caipora is considered to be a cannibal and would eat anything, even the smallest insects.\n\nThe Caipora is known as a forest dweller, as a king of the animals of sorts, and is very vengeful of hunters who do not respect the rules of \"fair-play\" when hunting. It is told that it scares away prey and \"hides\" animal tracks or makes hunters lose their way in the jungle. It disorients the hunters by simulating animal noises and by leaving fake tracks.\n\nAccording to a popular belief, his activity intensifies on those days in which hunting is not supposed to take place, therefore on Fridays, Sundays and the religious days. Religious beliefs prohibited hunting on certain days, but there are claims about ways to trick the protector of the forest. It is known that the Caipora likes smoke, so on Thursday nights, the hunters would leave smoke by the trunk of a tree and say \"Toma, Caipora, deixa eu ir embora\" (which means \"Here you go, Caipora, let me leave\" in Portuguese). The good luck of hunters is also due to the propitiatory gifts that were offered to the creature.\n\nIn the children's TV series \"Castelo Rá-Tim-Bum\", Caipora is a regular character. In this version is characterized as a female creature with a big red fur and a black mask. She has the ability to teleport when hear whistles and sometimes demonstrates wild aspects. The character has also made an appearance in a TV adaptation of Sítio do Picapau Amarelo, but being a male creature.\n\nIn \"Harry Potter\", the Caipora protect the magical school Castelobruxo in Brazil. They are described as small, furry, and extremely mischievous.\n\nIn the northeast area of Brazil, they say that being Caipora means that you are going through tough times, with bad luck and unhappiness.\n\nSome Brazilian writers, which include Machado de Assis and Aluísio de Azevedo, used the words \"Caipora\" and \"Caiporism\" to identify a state of misfortune.\n\nThe word \"Caipora\" has also been used to describe the slaves who had escaped into the forests.\n\n"}

Carbon-based fuels are of two main kinds, biofuels and fossil fuels. Whereas biofuels are derived from recent-growth organic matter and are typically harvested, as with logging of forests and cutting of corn, fossil fuels are of prehistoric origin and are extracted from the ground, the principal fossil fuels being oil, coal, and natural gas.\n\nFrom an economic policy perspective, an important distinction between biofuels and fossil fuels is that only the former is sustainable or renewable. \n\nWhereas we can continue to obtain energy from biofuels indefinitely in principle, the Earth's reserves of fossil fuels was determined millions of years ago and is therefore fixed as far as our foreseeable future is concerned. The great variability in the ease of extraction of fossil fuels however makes its endgame scenario one of increasing prices over one or more centuries rather than of abrupt exhaustion.\n\nFrom the perspective of climate and ecology, biofuels and fossil fuels have in common that they contribute to the production of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which has emerged in recent decades as the fastest-changing greenhouse gas, whose principal impacts are global warming and ocean acidification. However biofuels actively participate in the carbon cycle today by photosynthesizing carbon dioxide, unlike fossil fuels whose participation was long ago, and can therefore in principle bring atmospheric CO into an equilibrium not possible with the continued use of fossil fuel. But in practice photosynthesis is a slow process, and the additional fuel produced by artificial methods of accelerating it such as application of fertilizer tends to be offset by the energy consumed by the accelerating processes, to a degree currently under active debate. In contrast the speed of photosynthesis is immaterial for fossil fuels because they had millions of years in which to accumulate. Burning of both fossil fuels and biofuels usually also produces carbon monoxide, which is toxic and can kill a person after mixing with the haemoglobin of the blood, increasing its concentration in the body. Biofuels and fossil fuels may also produce many other air pollutants depending on the contents of the fuel.\n\n"}

In it, to avoid unclassical words such as \"rochus\" (chess rook) or \"alfinus\" (chess bishop), the rooks are described as towers (armored howdahs) on elephants' backs, and the bishops as archers:\n\nA leaked unauthorized 742-line draft version was published in 1525. Its text is very different, and in it Caïssa is called Scacchia, the chess rook is a cyclops, and the chess bishop is a centaur archer.\n\nThis led to the modern name \"castle\" for the chess rook, and thus the term \"castling\", and the modern shape of the European rook chesspiece. Also for a time, some chess players in Europe called the rook \"elephant\" and the bishop \"archer\". In German, \"Schütze\" (\"archer\") became a general word for a chess bishop until displaced by \"Läufer\" (\"runner\") in the 18th century.\n\nThe young English orientalist William Jones re-used the idea of a Chess poem in 1763, in his own poem \"Caïssa Or The Game at Chess\" written in English hexameters. In his poem, Caïssa initially repels the advances of the god of war, Mars. Spurned, Mars seeks the aid of the god Euphron (Jones's invention), brother of Venus, who creates the game of chess as a gift for Mars to win Caïssa's favor.\n\nIt is an unproven assumption that Jones's name \"Caïssa\" (ka-is-sa) is an equivalent to Vida's name \"Scacchia\" (ska-ki-a).\n\nThe English version of Philidor's Introduction to Chess contained Jones's poem. In 1851 the poem was translated into French by Camille Théodore Frédéric Alliey.\n\nCaïssa is referred to in chess commentary.\n\nCaïssa as a concept has also been explored by some who seek the evidence of the sacred feminine in chess.\n\nThe first computer program that won the World Computer Chess Championship (in 1974) was named Kaissa.\n\nThe card game features a program type named Caïssa, which are modeled after chess pieces.\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

The tube has a triode for amplification, along with two diodes, one typically for use as a detector and the other as a rectifier for automatic gain control, in one envelope. In practice the two diodes usually share a common cathode. Multiple tube sections in one envelope minimized the number of tubes required in a radio or other apparatus.\n\nIn European nomenclature a first letter \"E\" identifies tubes with heaters to be connected in parallel to a transformer winding of 6.3 V; \"A\" identifies similar 4 V; \"U\" identifies tubes with heaters to be connected in series across the mains supply, drawing 100 mA; \"H\" identifies similar 150 mA, \"C\" identifies similar 200 mA, and \"P\" identifies similar 300 mA series-connected tubes. Following the voltage letter, \"A\" stands for a low-current (signal) diode section, \"B\" for a double diode with common cathode section, \"C\" for a triode section, \"F\" for a pentode section, \"H\" for a hexode or heptode section, and \"L\" for a power tetrode or pentode section. The first number identified the base type, for example 3 for Octal base; 9 for B7G sub-miniature 7 pin. The remaining numbers identified a particular tube type; tubes with all characters except the first identical had identical electrodes but a different heater; e.g. the EBC81 and UBC81. Generally, odd numbers identified tubes / valves with variable mu characteristics and even numbers straight, or sharp cut-off types. \n\nAmerican nomenclature, also used in Europe, used a number to identify the heater voltage, then one or two sequentially assigned letters, then a number specifying the total number of electrodes plus one. The 6.3V EABC80 has 7 electrodes; the US equivalent are 6AK8 and 6T8, where the \"AK\" and \"T\" have no particular meaning; the 6N8 (EBF80) is a dual diode+pentode with 7 electrodes.\n\nThere are many double diode triode tubes, including EBC81 (6BD7), EBC90 (6AT6), EBC91 (6AV6) and the older EBC1, EBC2, EBC11, EBC21, EBC33, EBC41 (identical to EBC81 but Rimlock (B8A) socket instead of noval), ABC1 (EBC1 with a 4 V heater), CBC1 (EBC1 with a 200 mA heater). The commoner tube line-ups of an AM-only radio set with mains transformer having a double diode-triode were one of the following: ECH11+EF11+EBC11+EL11 Y8A Base -\"or\"- ECH42(or 41)+EF42(or 41)+ EBC41+ EL41(or 42) Rimlock Base -\"or\"- ECH81+EF80(or 85 or 89)+ EBC81(or 91)+ EL84 (noval Socket) + rectifier and magic eye indicator (depending on the radio class and manufacturer). AC/DC sets without mains transformer would use \"U\" tubes of the same types, e.g. UCH42+UF41+UBC41+UL41+UY41 rectifier.\n\nThere was also a tube with a double diode and a triode sharing a common cathode, and an additional, independent single diode section, named EABC80 or 6AK8 or 6T8 (with a shorter glass envelope) and its versions for AC/DC transformerless receivers with series heater chains, named PABC80 (9AK8, 300 mA for TV sets), HABC80 (19T8, 150 mA for radios) and UABC80 (27AK8, 100 mA for radios). This tube was designed for early AM/FM (MW/VHF) radio sets and was widely used until the end of the tube era; the double diode was used for FM demodulation, the third, independent diode for AM detection and/or automatic gain control (AGC).\n\nThe main configurations for an early tube AM/FM set using EABC80 in the 1950s and '60s were:\n\nEC92+EF80(or 85 or 89)+ECH81+EF80(or 85 or 89)+EABC80+EL84(or 95) -\"or\"- ECC85+EF80(or 85 or 89)+ECH81+EABC80+EL84(or 95)+ rectifier (tube or solid state) and indicator, depending on the radio class and manufacturer. For AC/DC radios, UCC85+UCH81+UF80(or 85 or 89)+UABC80+UL84+ rectifier and indicator.

It was approved on 25 October 2012 and entered into force on 4 December 2012. The directive introduces legally binding measures to encourage efforts to use energy more efficiently in all stages and sectors of the supply chain. It establishes a common framework for the promotion of energy efficiency within the EU in order to meet its energy efficiency headline target of 20% by 2020. It also paves the way for further improvements thereafter.\n\nThe directive provides for the establishment of indicative national energy efficiency targets for 2020. Member states were to have submitted their National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAP) by 30 April 2014, outlining the measures they have implemented to improve energy efficiency and their expected and/or achieved energy savings. In addition, member states are required to report annually on progress toward their national targets. The policy requirements in the directive are minimum obligations and member states may introduce more stringent measures.\n\nThe Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU was preceded by the Energy Services Directive 2006/32/EC. This earlier directive contained a target of a 9% reduction in energy usage within 9years of the directive coming into force. The earlier directive also required EU members to submit National Energy Efficiency Action Plans, with the first plan to be lodged by 30 June 2007.\n\nOn 23 July 2014 the European Commission announced a new target of a 30% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030.\n\nDocuments leaked in show that the United Kingdom repeatedly fought to water down key measures during the development of the directive and forced some measures to become voluntary rather than mandatory. As a result, a new version of the directive allows member states to set their own energy efficiency targets, instead of the original requirement of a mandatory target of 20% improvement.\n\nThe directive promotes rules to remove barriers in energy markets and to overcome market failures that may impede the uptake of energy efficiency. Under the directive, the public sector is to play an exemplary role and consumers will have a right to know how much energy they consume.\n\nThe following categories are covered by the directive:\n\n\nIndividual National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAP) for 2014 and Annual Reports for 2016 are available for download. Some national action plans have Wikipedia articles as well:\n\n\nA 2014 study finds that, despite the directive being technically complex and lacking binding targets, it is an improvement over earlier European Union policy on energy efficiency. Notwithstanding, the document is weakened by the number of exemptions and the number of passages it contains requiring interpretation. The process of implementation is also subject to problems.\n\nA 2016 study examines the treatment of article7 of the directive by each of the 28 member states. Titled \"Energy efficiency obligation schemes\", this key article requires that countries \"implement energy efficiency obligations and/or alternative policy instruments in order to reach a reduction in final energy use of 1.5% per year\". To fulfill this requirement, the member states have proposed very different policy measures and adopted very different calculation methods and monitoring and verification schemes. The study analyses each national action plan and estimates whether the projected savings are likely to materialise and whether these will be sufficient to meet the article7 target.\n\n\n\n"}

Within Hindu tradition, the five Pandavas from the epic, Mahabharata are described as staying in Ekachakra during their years in exile. It is also famous as the birthplace of Nityananda Rama (b 1474 CE), a principal religious figure in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition.\n\nThe village extends north and south for an area of about eight miles. Other villages, namely Viracandra-pura and Virabhadra-pura, are situated within the area of the village of Ekacakra. In honor of Virachandra Goswami (the son of Nityananda), these places are renowned as Viracandra-pura and Virabhadra-pura.\n\nThe origin of the name Ekachakra is associated with the legend of the Pandavas. In the battle of Kurukshetra when Krishna broke his vow of not taking any sides in the war to save his devotee Arjuna, he has rushed with a wheel to hit Bhishmadeva who had been fighting with Arjuna. When Bhishmadeva satisfied him with many beautiful prayers, Krishna lost his anger and tossed aside the wheel. The wheel fell on this tract of land and therefore got the name \"Ekachakra\". \"Eka\" means one, and \"chakra\" means wheel.\n\nIn the Mahabharata, it is also believed to be the place where Demon Bakasura lived who was later slain by Bhima. However, there are several places all over India which contest as ancient Ekachakra.\n\nThis is said to be the actual birthplace of Nityananda. In the Janmasthan Mandir there is a deity of Nitai (Nityananda) worshipped by a local brahmin family. Hadai Pandita Bhavan is the site of the original house of Nityananda’s father. The small white temple next to Nitai Kund marks the exact spot where Nityananda was born. There are two banyan trees by this temple that are said to have existed since the time of Nityananda.\n\nIn the center of the main altar of the temple is a deity of Lord Nityananda. To his left, with his hands raised, is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. On Nityananda’s right is Advaita Acharya. The side altar has deities of Radha-Radhakanta and Radha-Srikanta, a large dancing Gouranga in the center, and ten brass sakhis at the bottom. The temple was constructed by Prasannakumara Karapharma.\n\nThere is an old Pippala tree here called 'Mala Tala'. Just before Nityananda departed the village in his youth, Hadai Pandita came here and chanted japa under this tree. Mala means \"japa beads\" and tala means \"tree.\" When Nitai was about to depart Hadai Pandita left his japa beads here due to anxiety.\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu came to Ekacakra many years after Nityananda left. It is said that at that time Chaitanya left his flower garland on a branch of this tree. Mala also means \"garland.\" Therefore, also for this reason this tree was called Mala Tala.\n\n(Also known as Jahnu Kund) It is said that Nitai brought all the sacred waters from all the holy places to this kunda to save the local residents from having to journey to the Ganges to take a sacred bath. It is named Hantugada because Nityananda Prabhu used to perform the Dadhi-cida festival of distributing chipped rice with yogurt prasadam here and He would take the prasada while kneeling down.\n\nThis place is a five-minute walk (400m) into the fields, southeast of Nityananda’s birthplace. It is surrounded by a group of Keli-kadamba trees. The Pandavas are said to have lived here with their mother, Kunti, when they were exiled to the forest.\n\nThe current deity within the Bankima Raya temple was found by Nityananda himself, within the Yamuna river of Ekachakra.\nThe deity was then installed in a temple that is now submerged within Jahnu kunda.\nNityananda is believed to have merged within this deity at the time of his disappearance.\nThe present temple of Bankima Raya is also an old one.\nThe deity of Jahnava Mata (Nityananda's wife) was placed beside him.\nIn this temple there is also a small samadhi of Virachandra Goswami.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3276514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3276514", "title": "Energetics", "text": "Energetics\n\nEnergetics (also called energy economics) is the study of energy under transformation. Because energy flows at all scales, from the quantum level to the biosphere and cosmos, energetics is a very broad discipline, encompassing for example thermodynamics, chemistry, biological energetics, biochemistry and ecological energetics. Where each branch of energetics begins and ends is a topic of constant debate. For example, Lehninger (1973, p. 21) contended that when the science of thermodynamics deals with energy exchanges of all types, it can be called energetics.\n\nIn general, energetics is concerned with defining relationships to describe the tendencies of energy flows and storages under transformation, defined here as phenomena which behave like historical invariants under repeated observations. When some critical number of people have observed such invariance, such a principle is usually then given the status of a 'fundamental law' of science. As in all scientific inquiry, whether a theorem or principle is considered a fundamental law appears to depend on how many people agree to the proposition. The ultimate aim of energetics therefore is the description of fundamental laws. Philosophers of science have held that the fundamental laws of thermodynamics can be treated as laws of energetics, (Reiser 1926, p. 432). By continuing to more accurately describe these laws, energetics aims to produce reliable predictions about energy flow and storage transformations at any scale.\n\nEnergetics has a controversial history. Some authors maintain that the its origins may be found in the work of the ancient Greeks, but that the mathematical formalisation began with the work of Leibniz. Richard de Villamil (1928) said that Rankine formulated the science of energetics in his paper \"Outlines of the Science of Energetics\" published in the Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow in 1855. W. Ostwald and E. Mach subsequently developed the study, and by the late 1800s energetics was understood to be incompatible with the atomic view of the atom forwarded by Boltzmann's gas theory. Proof of the atom settled the dispute but not without significant damage. In the 1920s Lotka attempted to build on Boltzmann's views through a mathematical synthesis of energetics with biological evolutionary theory. Lotka proposed that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum useful energy flow transformation. This view subsequently influenced the further development of ecological energetics, especially the work of Howard T. Odum.\n\nDe Villamil attempted to clarify the scope of energetics with respect to other branches of physics by positing a system that divides mechanics into two branches; energetics (the science of energy), and \"pure\", \"abstract\" or \"rigid\" dynamics (the science of momentum). According to Villamil energetics can be mathematically characterised by scalar equations, and rigid dynamics by vector equations. In this division the dimensions for dynamics are \"space\", time and mass, and for energetics, \"length\", time and mass (Villamil 1928, p. 9). This division is made according to fundamental suppositions about the properties of bodies, e.g.:\n\n\nIn Villamil's classification system, dynamics says yes to 1 and no to 2, whereas energetics says no to 1 and yes to 2. Therefore, in Villamil's system, dynamics assumes that particles are rigidly fixed together and cannot vibrate, and consequently must all be at zero kelvin. The conservation of momentum is a consequence of this view, however it is considered valid only in logic and not to be a true representation of the facts (Villamil, p. 96). In contrast energetics does not assume that particles are rigidly fixed together, and thus are free to vibrate, and consequently can be at non-zero temperatures.\n\nAs a general statement of energy flows under transformation, the principles of energetics include the first four laws of thermodynamics which seek a rigorous description. However the precise place of the laws of thermodynamics within the principles of energetics is a topic currently under debate. If the ecologist Howard T. Odum was right, the principles of energetics take into consideration a hierarchical ordering of energy forms, which aims to account for the concept of energy quality, and the evolution of the universe. Albert Lehninger (1973, p. 2) called these hierarchical orderings the\n\nOdum proposed 3 further energetic principles and one corollary that take energy hierarchy into account. The first four principles of energetics are related to the same numbered laws of thermodynamics, and are expanded upon in that article.\n\n\n\n"}

Renewable technologies can enhance energy security in electricity generation, heat supply, and transportation.\n\nAccess to cheap energy has become essential to the functioning of modern economies. However, the uneven distribution of fossil fuel supplies among countries, and the critical need to widely access energy resources, has led to significant vulnerabilities. Threats to global energy security include political instability of energy producing countries, manipulation of energy supplies, competition over energy sources, attacks on supply infrastructure, as well as accidents and natural disasters. Energy security, therefore, has become fundamental from many perspectives, and is being therefore increasingly at the centre of legal and policy issues linked to social, economic, and development matters.\n\nThe Fukushima I nuclear accidents in Japan have brought new attention to how national energy systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, with climate change already bringing more weather and climate extremes. These threats to our old energy systems provide a rationale for investing in renewable energy. Shifting to renewable energy \"can help us to meet the dual goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thereby limiting future extreme weather and climate impacts, and ensuring reliable, timely, and cost-efficient delivery of energy\". Investing in renewable energy can have significant dividends for our energy security.\n\nThe International Energy Agency's \"World Energy Outlook 2006\" concludes that rising petroleum demand, if left unchecked, would accentuate vulnerability to a severe supply disruption and resulting sudden price increases, in consuming countries. Renewable biofuels for transport represent a key source of diversification from petroleum products. Biofuels from grain and beet in temperate regions have a role, but they are relatively expensive and their energy efficiency and carbon dioxide savings, vary. Biofuels from sugar cane and other highly productive tropical crops are much more competitive and beneficial. But all first generation biofuels ultimately compete with the production of food for land, water, and other resources. More effort is required to develop and commercialize second generation biofuel technologies, such as biorefineries and cellulosic ethanol, enabling the flexible production of biofuels and related products from non-edible parts of the plant.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), cellulosic ethanol commercialization could allow ethanol fuels to play a much larger role in the future than previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be produced in many regions of the United States.\n\nIn those countries where growing dependence on imported gas is a pressing energy security issue, renewable energy technologies can provide alternative sources of electric power production as well as displacing electricity demand through production of direct heat. The IEA suggests that the direct contribution that renewable energy can make to domestic or commercial space heating and industrial process heat should be examined more closely. Heat from solar, geothermal sources, and heat pumps, is increasingly economic but is often overlooked in government programmes that promote public acceptance and provide incentives for renewable electricity and energy efficiency.\n\nSolar heating systems are a well known technology and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses. The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment. In many warmer climates, a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage (50 to 75%) of domestic hot water energy.\n\nAs the electricity grid becomes increasingly vulnerable to faults from equipment failure, willful attack or even sunspot activity, the risk of a major national scale grid failure is rising. The deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks. The IEA suggests that attention in this area has focused too much on the issue of the variability of renewable electricity production. However, this only applies to certain renewable technologies, mainly wind power and solar photovoltaics, and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned, the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system, as well as the demand side flexibility. Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment. But at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management, and additional costs may be required for back-up or system modification.\n\nRenewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system: \n\nIn 2010, four German states, totaling 10 million people, relied on wind power for 43-52% of their annual electricity needs. Denmark isn't far behind, supplying 22% of its power from wind in 2010 (26% in an average wind year). The Extremadura region of Spain is getting up to 25% of its electricity from solar, while the whole country meets 16% of its demand from wind. Just during 2005-2010, Portugal vaulted from 17% to 45% renewable electricity. \n\nMinnkota Power Cooperative, the leading U.S. wind utility in 2009, supplied 38% of its retail sales from the wind.\n\nPhysicist Amory Lovins has said that following hundreds of blackouts in 2005, Cuba reorganized its electricity transmission system into networked microgrids and cut the occurrence of blackouts to zero within two years, limiting damage even after two hurricanes. Networked island-able microgrids describes Lovins’ vision where energy is generated locally from solar power, wind power and other resources and used by super-efficient buildings. When each building, or neighborhood, is generating its own power, with links to other “islands” of power, the security of the entire network is greatly enhanced.\n\nThe Combined Power Plant, a project linking 36 wind, solar, biomass, and hydroelectric installations throughout Germany, has demonstrated that a combination of renewable sources and more-effective control can balance out short-term power fluctuations and provide reliable electricity with 100 percent renewable energy.\n\nIt has been argued that investor-state dispute settlement rights may grant investors in carbon-intensive industries a mechanism to inhibit government policies promoting renewable energy technologies. The impact of dispute settlement through international arbitration or negotiation, however, is also deemed to be a useful tool to foster investment in sustainable energy and tackle connected issues linked to security, environmental threats, and sustainable development.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6095325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6095325", "title": "Gilgamesh flood myth", "text": "Gilgamesh flood myth\n\nThe Gilgamesh flood myth is a flood myth in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". Many scholars believe that the flood myth was added to Tablet XI in the \"standard version\" of the Gilgamesh Epic by an editor who utilized the flood story from the Epic of Atrahasis. A short reference to the flood myth is also present in the much older Sumerian Gilgamesh poems, from which the later Babylonian versions drew much of their inspiration and subject matter.\n\nGilgamesh’s supposed historical reign is believed to have been approximately 2700 BCE, shortly before the earliest known written stories. The discovery of artifacts associated with Aga and Enmebaragesi of Kish, two other kings named in the stories, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh.\n\nThe earliest Sumerian Gilgamesh poems date from as early as the Third dynasty of Ur (2100–2000 BCE). One of these poems mentions Gilgamesh’s journey to meet the flood hero, as well as a short version of the flood story. The earliest Akkadian versions of the unified epic are dated to ca. 2000–1500 BCE. Due to the fragmentary nature of these Old Babylonian versions, it is unclear whether they included an expanded account of the flood myth; although one fragment definitely includes the story of Gilgamesh’s journey to meet Utnapishtim. The “standard” Akkadian version included a long version of the story and was edited by Sin-liqe-unninni sometime between 1300 and 1000 BCE.\n\nThe Gilgamesh flood tablet XI contains additional story material besides the flood. The flood story was included because in it the flood hero Utnapishtim is granted immortality by the gods and that fits the immortality theme of the epic. The main point seems to be that Utnapishtim was granted eternal life in unique, never-to-be-repeated circumstances. As if to demonstrate this point, Utnapishtim challenges Gilgamesh to stay awake for six days and seven nights. However, as soon as Utnapishtim finishes speaking Gilgamesh falls asleep. Utnapishtim instructs his wife to bake a loaf of bread for every day he is asleep so that Gilgamesh cannot deny his failure. Gilgamesh, who wants to overcome death, cannot even conquer sleep.\n\nAs Gilgamesh is leaving, Utnapishtim's wife asks her husband to offer a parting gift. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh of a boxthorn-like plant at the very bottom of the ocean that will make him young again. Gilgamesh obtains the plant by binding stones to his feet so he can walk on the bottom of the sea. He recovers the plant and plans to test it on an old man when he returns to Uruk. Unfortunately, when Gilgamesh stops to bathe it is stolen by a serpent that sheds its skin as it departs, apparently reborn. Gilgamesh, having failed both chances, returns to Uruk, where the sight of its massive walls provokes him to praise this enduring work of mortal men. The implication may be that mortals can achieve immortality through lasting works of civilization and culture.\n\nLines 1-203, Tablet XI (note: with \"supplemental sub-titles and line numbers added for clarity\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the flood story material, (lines 1–203), tablet XI contains the following flood story elements:\n\nList of titled subparts, Tablet XI-(by Kovacs):\n\nThese are some of the sentences copied more or less directly from the \"Atrahasis\" version to the \"Gilgamesh\" epic:\nThe Epic of Atrahasis provides additional information on the flood and flood hero that is omitted in Gilgamesh XI and other versions of the Ancient Near East flood myth. According to Atrahasis III ii, lines 40–47 the flood hero was at a banquet when the storm and flood began: \"He invited his people ... to a banquet ... He sent his family on board. They ate and they drank. But he (Atrahasis) was in and out. He could not sit, could not crouch, for his heart was broken and he was vomiting gall.\"\n\nAccording to Tigay, Atrahasis tablet III iv, lines 6–9 clearly identify the flood as a local river flood: \"Like dragonflies they [dead bodies] have filled the river. Like a raft they have moved in to the edge [of the boat]. Like a raft they have moved in to the riverbank.\" The sentence \"Like dragonflies they have filled the river.\" was changed in Gilgamesh XI line 123 to \"Like the spawn of fishes, they fill the sea.\" Tigay holds that we can see the mythmaker's hand at work here, changing a local river flood into an ocean deluge.\n\nMost other authorities interpret the Atrahasis flood as universal. A. R. George, and Lambert and Millard make it clear that the gods' intention in Atrahasis is to \"wipe out mankind\". The flood destroys \"all of the earth\". The use of a comparable metaphor in the Gilgamesh epic suggests that the reference to \"dragonflies [filling] the river\" is simply an evocative image of death rather than a literal description of the flood However, the local river flood in Atrahasis could accomplish destruction of all \"mankind\" and \"all of the earth\" if the scope of \"mankind\" is limited to all of the people living on \"all of the land\" of the flood plains in the lower river valley known to the Atrahasis writer.\n\nOther editorial changes were made to the Atrahasis text in Gilgamesh to lessen the suggestion that the gods may have experienced human needs. For example, Atrahasis OB III, 30–31 \"The Anunnaki, the great gods [were sitt]ing in thirst and hunger\" was changed in Gilgamesh XI, line 113 to \"The gods feared the deluge.\" Sentences in Atrahasis III iv were omitted in Gilgamesh, e.g. \"She was surfeited with grief and thirsted for beer\" and \"From hunger they were suffering cramp.\"\n\nThese and other editorial changes to Atrahasis are documented and described in the book by Prof. Tigay (see below) who is associate professor of Hebrew and Semitic languages and literature in the University of Pennsylvania. Prof. Tigay comments: \"The dropping of individual lines between others which are preserved, but are not synonymous with them, appears to be a more deliberate editorial act. These lines share a common theme, the hunger and thirst of the gods during the flood.\"\n\nAlthough the 18th century BC copy of the Atrahasis (Atra-Hasis) epic post-dates the early Gilgamesh epic, we do not know whether the Old-Akkadian Gilgamesh tablets included the flood story, because of the fragmentary nature of surviving tablets. Some scholars argue that they did not. Tigay, for example, maintains that three major additions to the Gilgamesh epic, namely the prologue, the flood story (tablet XI), and tablet XII, were added by an editor or editors, possibly by Sin-leqi-unninni, to whom the entire epic was later attributed. According to this view, the flood story in tablet XI was based on a late version of the Atrahasis story.\n\nAs with most translations, especially from an ancient, dead language, scholars differ on the meaning of ambiguous sentences.\n\nFor example, line 57 in Gilgamesh XI is usually translated (with reference to the boat) \"ten rods the height of her sides\", or \"its walls were each 10 times 12 cubits in height\". A rod was a dozen cubits, and a Sumerian cubit was about 20 inches. Hence these translations imply that the boat was about 200 feet high, which would be impractical with the technology in Gilgamesh's time (about 2700 BC). There is no Akkadian word for \"height\" in line 57. The sentence literally reads \"Ten dozen-cubits each I-raised its-walls.\" A similar example from an unrelated house building tablet reads: \"he shall build the wall [of the house] and raise it four ninda and two cubits.\" This measurement (about 83 feet) means wall length not height.\n\nLine 142 in Gilgamesh XI is usually translated \"Mount Niṣir held the boat, allowing no motion.\" Niṣir is often spelled \"Nimush\", which is described as the newer reading. The Akkadian words translated \"Mount Niṣir\" are \"KUR-ú KUR ni-ṣir\". The word KUR could mean hill or country; it is capitalized because it is a Sumerian word. The first KUR is followed by a phonetic complement \"-ú\" which indicates that KUR-ú is to be read in Akkadian as \"šadú\" (hill) and not as \"mātu\" (country). Since \"šadú\" (hill) could also mean \"mountain\" in Akkadian, and scholars knew the Biblical expression \"Mount Ararat\", it has become customary to translate \"šadú\" as \"mountain\" or \"mount\". The flood hero was Sumerian, according to the WB-62 Sumerian King List, and in Sumerian the word KUR meant \"hill\" or \"country\", not \"mountain\". The second KUR lacks a phonetic complement and is therefore read in Akkadian as \"mātu\" (country). Hence, the entire clause reads \"The hill/mound country niṣir held the boat\".\n\nLines 146-147 in Gilgamesh XI are usually translated \"I ... made sacrifice, incense I placed on the peak of the mountain.\" Similarly \"I poured out a libation on the peak of the mountain.\" But Kovacs provides this translation of line 156: \"I offered incense in front of the mountain-ziggurat.\" Parpola provides the original Akkadian for this sentence: \"áš-kun sur-qin-nu ina UGU ziq-qur-rat KUR-i\" Áš-kun means I-placed; sur-qin-nu means offering; ina-(the preposition) means on-(upon); UGU means top-of; ziq-qur-rat means temple tower; and KUR-i means hilly. Parpola's glossary (page 145) defines ziq-qur-rat as \"temple tower, ziggurat\" and refers to line 157 so he translates ziq-qur-rat as temple tower in this context. The sentence literally reads \"I placed an offering on top of a hilly ziggurat.\" A ziggurat was an elevated platform or temple tower where priests made offerings to the temple god. Most translators of line 157 disregard ziq-qur-rat as a redundant metaphor for peak. There is no authority for this other than previous translations of line 157. Kovacs' translation retains the word ziggurat on page 102.\n\nOne of the Sumerian cities with a ziggurat was Eridu located on the southern branch of the Euphrates River next to a large swampy low-lying depression known as the apsû. The only ziggurat at Eridu was at the temple of the god Ea (Enki), known as the apsû-house. In Gilgamesh XI, line 42 the flood hero said \"I will go down [the river] to the apsû to live with Ea, my Lord.\"\n\nLines 189–192 (lines 198–201) in Gilgamesh XI are usually translated \"Then Enlil came aboard the boat. He took hold of my hand and brought me on board. He brought aboard my wife and made her kneel at my side. Standing between us, he touched our foreheads to bless us.\" In the first sentence \"Then dingir-kabtu came aboard the boat\" the Akkadian determinative dingir is usually translated as \"god\", but can also mean \"priest\" Dingir-kabtu literally means \"divine important-person\". Translating this as Enlil is the translator's conjecture.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29382860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29382860", "title": "Global Precipitation Measurement", "text": "Global Precipitation Measurement\n\nGlobal Precipitation Measurement (GPM) or Global Precipitation Index (GPI) is a joint mission between JAXA and NASA as well as other international space agencies to make frequent (every 2–3 hours) observations of Earth’s precipitation. It is part of NASA's Earth Systematic Missions program and works with a satellite constellation to provide full global coverage. The project provides global precipitation maps to assist researchers in improving the forecasting of extreme events, studying global climate, and adding to current capabilities for using such satellite data to benefit society. GPM builds on the notable successes of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), which was also a joint NASA-JAXA activity.\n\nThe project is managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, and consists of a GPM Core Observatory satellite assisted by a constellation of spacecraft from other agencies and missions. The Core Observatory satellite measures the two and three dimensional structure of Earth’s precipitation patterns and provides a new calibration standard for the rest of the satellite constellation. The GPM Core Observatory was assembled and tested at Goddard Space Flight Center, and launched from Tanegashima Space Center, Japan, on a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries H-IIA rocket. The launch occurred on February 28, 2014 at 3:37am JST on the first attempt. Agencies in the United States, Japan, India and France (together with Eumetsat) operate the remaining satellites in the constellation for agency-specific goals, but also cooperatively provide data for GPM.\nGPM has five broad science objectives:\n\nThe DPR is a spaceborne radar, providing three-dimensional maps of storm structure across its swath, including the intensity of rainfall and snowfall at the surface. The DPR has two frequencies, allowing researchers to estimate the sizes of precipitation particles and detect a wider range of precipitation rates. The Ku-band radar, similar to the PR on TRMM, covers a 245 km (152 mile) swath. Nested inside that, the Ka-band radar covers a 120 km (74.5 mile) swath. Data from the DPR is sent to the ground via a single-access link with TDRSS relay satellites.\n\nThe GMI is a passive sensor that observes the microwave energy emitted by the Earth and atmosphere at 13 different frequency/polarization channels. These data allow quantitative maps of precipitation across a swath that is 885 km (550 miles) wide. This instrument continues the legacy of TRMM microwave observations, while adding four additional channels, better resolution, and more reliable calibration. Data from the GMI is continuously sent to the ground via a multiple-access link with TDRSS relay satellites.\n\nGPM produces and distributes a wide variety of precipitation data products. Processing takes place at the Precipitation Processing System (PPS) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, as well as at the JAXA facility in Japan. Data is provided at multiple \"levels\" of processing, from raw satellite measurements to best-estimate global precipitation maps using combinations of all the constellation observations and other meteorological data. All data from the mission is made freely available to the public on NASA websites. Precipitation data is made available in a variety of formats, spatial and temporal resolutions, and processing levels which are accessible on the Precipitation Measurement Missions \"Data Access\" webpage. Several data visualization and analysis tools have been made available to provide easy access for the science and applications communities, which include the in-browser Earth science data analysis tool Giovanni, a web API, and a 3D near-realtime global precipitation viewer. \nIn addition to maintaining social media accounts and the GPM Road to Launch Blog, JAXA and NASA developed several outreach activities specific to this mission prior to launch that the public could participate in. After launch a series of featured articles and videos were produced to highlight various scientific goals and discoveries of the mission, and an \"Extreme Weather\" blog is maintained to provide timely updates about the latest extreme precipitation events and natural disasters occurring around the world. A Precipitation Education website is also maintained to provide teachers and students with lesson plans, animations, and other resources to teach about the water cycle, Earth science, and the GPM mission. \n\nThe main character Mohan Bharghav (Shahrukh Khan) in 2004 Indian film \"Swades: We, the People\" is a Project Manager in NASA's GPM project. Movie starts from NASA's GPM project analysis. Bharghav discuss the importance of GPM and its positive impact on Earth. In the movie the GPM satellite is launched by the Space Shuttle.\n\nA short anime film of 6 minutes, \"Dual frequency Precipitation Radar Special Movie\", was produced by JAXA and White Fox in 2013.\n\n"}

Bushby's trek is known as the Goliath Expedition.\n\nBushby was born 30 March 1969 in Hull, England. He attended a local comprehensive school and joined the British Army at the age of 16. Bushby served with the 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment for 11 years.\n\nThe Goliath Expedition is Bushby's attempt to walk around the world \"with unbroken footsteps\", from Punta Arenas, Chile, to his home in Hull, England. He began his journey on 1 November 1998 and originally expected to finish the over- trek in 8 years, though numerous delays ensure it will not be completed until sometime after 2018.\n\nBushby set off from Punta Arenas, Chile, on 1 November 1998, and had completed over as of 2006, walking through South, Central, and North America. With over to walk, and maintaining his current speed, he then estimated he would return home to Hull, England, by 2012.\n\nIn March 2006, Bushby and French adventurer Dimitri Kieffer crossed the Bering Strait on foot, having to take a roundabout 14-day route across a frozen section to cross the wide strait from Alaska to Siberia. They were detained by Russian border troop officers while they were crossing the Russian border near the Chukotkan village of Uelen, for not entering Russia at a correct port-of-entry. They were threatened to be banned from Russia, which would stop the journey. It was announced on 5 May 2006, that the Russian appeal court had upheld Bushby's application and his walk would continue. This was reported to be the result of consultation between John Prescott, the then British Deputy Prime Minister (and MP in Bushby's home town of Hull), and Roman Abramovich, the then Governor of Chukotka.\n\nOn 16 March 2007, it was announced that Bushby has successfully obtained the required permission from the Russian authorities, and began to prepare for the second half of his Goliath Expedition. Bushby would walk the first leg of this stage to Yakutsk, along with Kieffer. He had a difficult struggle with the Russian authorities to get a visa and a visit permit (the entire area is a military area, and a special visit permit is needed). During 2007, he managed to walk more than from Uelen to Dvoynoye (not far from Bilibino), returning to Alaska when his visa ran out in November.\n\nIn 2008 he only walked for three weeks, reaching Bilibino. He started very late, since the visa approval was delayed, and when the snow disappeared in May he could not continue because the area is filled with swamps and rivers, impossible to penetrate on foot when not frozen. He is only allowed to be in Russia for 90 days out of every 180 days per visa, and he must leave the country before each visa expires.\n\nFrom late 2008 to 2010, he spent his time in Mexico for cost reasons and was unable to travel to Russia. This was both because of trouble getting a visa and permits, and because of financial trouble; Bushby lost several of his sponsors as a result of the Late-2000s financial crisis. After Bushby secured new sponsors in 2010, the Russian government issued him another visa, and he resumed walking across Russia in the spring of 2011.\n\nIn addition to the 90-day time restraint imposed by Russian visas, Bushby has been hampered by the tundra conditions. Because his route takes him through an area that can only be traveled on foot via frozen rivers and ice roads, he can only walk during the late winter and early spring. On 25 April 2011, after walking approximately , Bushby reached the town of Srednekolymsk, completing his leg for 2011. Beginning his 2012 leg, he only needed to travel an additional before reaching improved roads, meaning his travel will only be limited by the Russian visa rules. On 12 April 2012, Bushby reported on his site that the Russian authorities had denied him a visa for 2012. He will continue to try to obtain a visa at some point in the future.\n\nIn March 2013 Russia banned Bushby from re-entering Russia for five years.\n\nWith help from National Geographic Bushby walked over 3,000 miles from Los Angeles to Washington DC. His destination was the Russian Embassy. At the end of the adventure Bushby's visa ban was overturned and he was granted a letter of invitation from the Russian government. He was granted a visa in 2014, at the embassy, marking the end of his year long journey.\n\nBushby crossed Russia-Mongolia border in 2017, and as of 08 August 2017 he is in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.\n\nBushby wrote a book about his walk entitled \"Giant Steps\", first published in 2005. The latest edition (2007) includes events up to 31 March 2006, and his Bering Strait crossing.\n\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

The \"kaya\" forest is considered to be an intrinsic source of ritual power and the origin of cultural identity; it is also a place of prayer for members of the particular ethnic group. The settlement, ritual centre, and fortified enclosure associated with the forest are also part of the \"kaya\". In the present day, the \"kaya\" is also referred to as a traditional organizational unit of the Mijikenda. Eleven of the approximately 30 separate \"kaya\" have been grouped together and inscribed as the Sacred Mijikenda Kaya Forests, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nMore than 50 \"kaya\" have been identified within the Kwale, Mombasa, and Kilifi counties. They measure between 30 and 300 hectares each. These are scattered over a coastal stretch of in the southern coastal plains area of Kenya, between the towns of Mombasa and Kilifi. While visitors are not allowed to enter most \"makaya\", Kaya Kinondo, a 30-hectare forest on Diani Beach, allows visitors and falls under the auspices of the Kaya Kinondo Ecotourism Project.\n\nMany \"kaya\" were originally fortified villages of the various ethnic groups, the Digo, Chonyi, Kambe, Duruma, Kauma, Ribe, Rabai, Jibana, and Giriama people. The villages have lowland tropical forest areas in their surrounds and were reached via paths through the forest. The forest flora was used solely for the collection of medicinal herbs. The practices of tree cutting, livestock grazing, and farmland clearing were not permitted within a \"kaya\".\n\nIn the present day, intensive deforestation for agricultural use and logging necessitated declaring 38 \"kaya\" forest areas legally as national monuments.

While plant species identified are 187 plant, bird species are 48, and butterflies 45 species.Colobus monkey and Golden-rumped elephant shrew are also reported.\n\nEntry into the forest was dictated by the traditional rules set by a governing body called the \"ngambi\" formed by elderly members of the community. This governing body was primarily concerned with its management, conservation and utilization of the biological resources in adherence to the traditional beliefs about the sacredness of the forest. However, the creation of central governing body has affected the role of the local elders.\n\nAn Eco Tourism project was launched in 2001 with funds provided by Ford Foundation with the objective of generating income for the local people and also encourage ecotorism and concurrently help preserve the sacredness of the forests. Eleven Mijikenda \"kaya\" were grouped together and inscribed as the Sacred Mijikenda Kaya Forests, a World Heritage Site, in 2008 under criteria (iii), (v), and (vi).\n\n\"Fingo\" (protective talismans) are buried in the \"kaya\" and are cared for by \"kaya\" elders who protect the traditions of the Mijikenda. Mijikenda believe that they brought the \"fingo\" charms from their ancestral home of Shungwaya, a myth of origin. In the present day, many \"fingo\" are lost or stolen, considered to be objet d'art.\n\nThere are many myths and beliefs narrated by the local women of the area which relate to the sacredness of these forests. It is the general belief that the forests are inhabited by spirits. Some of them believe that cutting a tree with a machete could result in the machete rebounding and causing injury to the leg which could be healed only by offering cloth to village elders in a ceremony. It is also believed that food cooked using wood from these sacred forest could cause sickness, and also that a dwelling built with timber drawn from the forest would collapse. The conservation of the sacredness of the forest was aimed at preserving its darkness.\n\n\n"}

The word \"korrigan\" means \"small-dwarf\" (\"korr\" means dwarf, \"ig\" is a diminutive and the suffix \"an\" is a hypocoristic). It is closely related to the Cornish word \"korrik\" which means \"gnome\". The name changes according to the place. Among the other names, there are \"korrig\", \"korred\", \"korrs\", \"kores\", \"couril\", \"crion\", \"goric\", \"kornandon\", \"ozigan\", \"nozigan\", \"torrigan\", \"viltañs\", \"poulpikan\", \"paotred ar sabad\"...\n\nThe term is used variously by writers on Breton folklore. Théodore de Villemarqué in \"Barzaz Breiz\" uses the term interchangeably with \"fairy\" and distinguishes them from dwarves (\"nains\"). In contrast Walter Evans-Wentz in \"The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries\" argued that in the mythology of Morbihan there is no clear distinction between korrigans and nains: \"Very often corrigans regarded as nains, equally with all kinds of \"lutins\", are believed to be evil spirits or demons condemned to live here on earth in a penitential state for an indefinite time.\" They like to dance around fountains. However, they give themselves away when they cannot enumerate the full list of the days of the week (because of the sacredness of the full week).\n\nOther authors use the term only to refer to siren-like female fairies who inhabit springs and rivers, \"lovely lustful golden-haired women who tried to lure men into their beds – and into a watery death\". These creatures are very beautiful when seen at dusk or night, but by day their eyes are red, their hair white, and their skin wrinkled; thus they try to avoid being seen by day.\n\nKorrigans have beautiful hair and red flashing eyes. They are sometimes described as important princesses or druidesses who were opposed to Christianity when the Apostles came to convert Brittany. They hate priests, churches, and especially the Virgin Mary. They can predict the future, change shape, and move at lightning speed. Like sirens and mermaids, they sing and comb their long hair, and they haunt fountains and water wells. They have the power of making men fall in love with them, but they then kill the ones who do. In many popular tales, they are eager to deceive the imprudent mortals who see them dancing or looking after a treasure, and fond of stealing human children, substituting them with changelings. On the night of 31 October (Samhain), they are said to be lurking near dolmens, waiting for victims.\n\nAccording to the Breton poem, Ar-Rannou, there are 9 korrigans, \"who dance, with flowers in their hair, and robes of white wool, around the fountain, by the light of the full moon.\"\n\n"}

There are many hypothesised magnetic weapons, such as the railgun and coilgun which accelerate a magnetic (in the case of railguns; non-magnetic) mass to a high velocity, or ion cannons and plasma cannons which focus and direct charged particles using magnetic fields.\n\nRailguns use two parallel metal rails connected to a power supply. When a conductive projectile is placed between the rails, the circuit is completed and a magnetic field is created down the rails up to the point of the projectile. This creates a force which pushes the projectile along the track, accelerating it to great speeds until it leaves the rails and the circuit is broken.\n\nCoilguns, on the other hand, have a barrel made up of coils of magnetic material. The projectile is placed between the coils, which have a pulse of electricity passed through them. This pulls the projectile into the centre of the coil. The coils further down the track are then pulsed in sequence at specific times, accelerating the projectile until it leaves the barrel. \n\nIon cannons are beam weapons that fire beams of ions (particles, i.e. atoms that have been affected in some way as to cause them to gain an electrical charge). Ion cannons are actually particle cannons; only the particles used are ionized. Due to their electrical charges, the fired ions also have the potential to disable electronic devices, vehicles, and anything else that has an electrical or similar power source. The inspiration for this effect arises from the electromagnetic pulse generated by nuclear detonations, which can be devastating to electronic devices.\n\n\n"}

It opened as the Proto-Tethys Ocean subducted under these terranes and closed as the Cimmerian terranes (that also broke-off Gondwana and moved north) gave way to the Tethys Ocean. Confusingly, the Neo-Tethys is sometimes defined as the ocean south of a hypothesised mid-ocean ridge separating Greater Indian from Asia, in which case the ocean between Cimmeria and this hypothesised ridge is called the Meso-Tethys, i.e. the \"Middle-Tethys\".\n\nThe so-called Hunic terranes are divided into the \"European Hunic\" (today the crust under parts of Europe – called Armorica – and Iberia) and \"Asiatic Hunic\" (today the crust of parts of southern Asia). A large transform fault separated the two terranes.\n\nThe role the Paleo-Tethys played in the supercontinent cycle, and especially the break-up of Pangaea, is unresolved. Some geologists argue that the opening of the North Atlantic was triggered by the subduction of Panthalassa under the western margins of the Americas while other argue that the closure of the Paleo-Tethys and Tethys resulted in the break-up. In the first scenario, mantle plumes caused the opening of the Atlantic and the break-up of Pangaea and the closure of the Tethyan domain was one of the consequences of this process; in the other scenario, the longitudinal forces that closed the Tethyan domain were transmitted latitudinally in what is today the Mediterranean region, resulting in the initial opening of the Atlantic.\n\nThe Paleo-Tethys Ocean began to form when back-arc spreading separated the European Hunic terranes from Gondwana in the late Ordovician, to begin moving toward Euramerica (also known as the Old Red Sandstone Continent) in the north. In the process, the plate under the Rheic Ocean between Euramerica and the European Hunic terranes subducted and rifts in this plate resulted in the formation of a small Rhenhercynian Ocean which lasted until Late Carboniferous time.\n\nIn the Early Devonian, the eastern part of Paleo-Tethys opened up, when the Asiatic Hunic terranes, including the North and South China microcontinents, moved northward.\n\nThese events caused Proto-Tethys Ocean, a precursor of Paleo-Tethys, to shrink, until the Late Carboniferous, when the Chinese blocks collided with Siberia. In the Early Carboniferous however, a subduction zone developed south of the European Hunic terranes consuming Paleo-Tethys oceanic crust.\n\nIn the Carboniferous continental collision took place between the Old Red Sandstone Continent and the European Hunic terrane, in North America this is called the Alleghenian orogeny, in Europe the Variscan orogeny. The Rheic Ocean had completely disappeared, and the western Paleo-Tethys was closing.\n\nBy the Late Permian, the small elongated Cimmerian plate (today's crust of Turkey, Iran, Tibet and parts of South-East Asia) broke away from Gondwana (now part of Pangaea). South of the Cimmerian continent a new ocean, the Tethys Ocean, was created. By the Late Triassic, all that was left of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean was a narrow seaway.\n\nIn the Early Jurassic epoch, as part of the Alpine Orogeny, the oceanic crust of the Paleo-Tethys subducted under the Cimmerian plate, closing the ocean from west to east. A last remnant of Paleo-Tethys Ocean might be an oceanic crust under the Black Sea. (Anatolia, to the sea's south, is a part of the original Cimmerian continent that formed the southern boundary of the Paleo-Tethys.)\n\nThe Paleo-Tethys Ocean sat where the Indian Ocean and Southern Asia are now located. The Equator ran the length of the sea, giving it a tropical climate. The shores and islands probably supported dense coal forests.\n\n"}
{"id": "10396528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10396528", "title": "Peter Rose and Anne Conlon", "text": "Peter Rose and Anne Conlon\n\nPeter Anthony Rose MBE (music) and Anne Conlon MBE (words) are award-winning writers best known for their environmental musicals for children. They were both teachers in Lancashire, England, for the majority of their creative achievements and most of their works have been written specially for St Augustine's RC High School, Billington. At the time Peter Rose was their head of music.\n\nRose and Conlon's first collaboration was \"The Conversion Job\" (1980–1); a currently unpublished musical which told the story of Augustine and his monks as they tried to convert Britain to Christianity. This was first performed at St Augustine's RC High School. Their second collaboration was the choral piece \"The Kestrel Song\" (1982), which was later published by their publishers Josef Weinberger (1995). This piece describes\n\"the thoughts of a kestrel as it hovers above the motorway… From the safety of the sky, the Kestrel watches \"all the madness of these men rushing blindly onwards\". The fog descends, but the traffic rushes on, until the inevitable disaster happens\"\n\"The Kestrel Song\" won them the \"1982 BBC Pebble Mill – WWF Sounds Natural\" competition, which brought the writers to the attention of Ivan Hattingh, Head of Development at WWF-UK at the time. Shortly after this, Ivan Hattingh called the writers and asked them to write an extended musical, similar to \"The Kestrel Song\", but about the Amazon Rainforest. Although it seemed an impossible task, they accepted and penned the first half of \"Yanomamo\" (1983), which described the beauties of the Amazon rainforest. By the second half, which contrasts the lighter first, the writers explore the human problems that existed in the Amazon basin at the time, and ask strong questions about western attitudes to tribal societies and our role in protecting such important and sensitive natural balances.\n\n\"Yanomamo\" is a 90-minute work for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band, and the original production, performed by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School, was narrated by Sir David Attenborough and premiered at the Royal Institute, London, before appearing at the Edinburgh Festival. They later performed \"Yanomamo\" in America, narrated by Sting, which production was recorded for television and later broadcast (on Easter Sunday, 1989) on Channel 4 under the title of \"Song of the Forest\". The TV version was commercially released by WWF. Since its publication the musical has seen performances by thousands of children throughout the world. This interest was also helped by the inclusion of \"Yanomamo\" as part of the BBC Radio Music Workshop series for schools (1991), including a short dramatic script specially written for the series by Conlon. After the TV adaption was broadcast, the school was officially recognised when two of the young soloists were presented to the Duke of Edinburgh and presented with the Ford European Conservation Award in the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\n\nRose and Conlon's next collaboration was in 1985 with \"Daughters of Pendle\". This fully dramatic musical explores 16th-century witchcraft in Lancashire, and was first performed by St Augustine's RC High School. The show is currently unpublished.\n\nAfter the highly successful \"Yanomamo\", Ivan Hattingh commissioned Rose and Conlon to write another musical, outlining the severe problems of migration from the countryside to the cities in developing countries. \"African Jigsaw\" (1986) was written and first performed by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School at the Barbican Concert Hall, London, narrated by actress Mary Miller and winning a Henry Ford Conservation Award. \"African Jigsaw\" was also performed by the school at the Royal Festival Hall in 1987, this time with Sir Charles Groves and the Philharmonic Orchestra at a Royal Gala charity performance for the homeless. Again, this musical is a 90-minute work for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band. \"African Jigsaw\" was later transmitted as a Splash Special by ITV in 1987, and also part of the ITV Middle English series. Conlon's narration explores the thoughts of one central character; an African mother who has stayed in the countryside whilst her son has started a new life for himself in the city.\n\nThree years later saw their third WWF commission, \"Ocean World\" (1990). This time they focused on the problems that threaten the existence of the sea. \"Ocean World\" tells the story of a female humpback whale as she journeys to her northern feeding grounds. We are with her at the birth to her first calf, and along her journey we meet other creatures of the deep who have their own problems to contend with. Ocean World premiered at the Royal Festival Hall by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School and was narrated by Sir David Attenborough. A television version, currently available from WWF-UK, was made and transmitted in 1991 as part of Channel 4's \"Fragile Earth\" series. The work follows the same pattern as their previous WWF commissions, and is a 90-minute work for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band.\n\nRose and Conlon are also known for writing work with a Christian message. In 1987, they were commissioned to write a Harvest Festival Anthem, \"Care for your World\", which was performed on BBC's \"Songs of Praise\". Two years later, in March 1989 their hymns were featured in \"The Daily Service\" on BBC Radio 4. \nRose and Conlon did not collaborate after this until 1996, with the publication of their hymn book \"Hymns for a Caring World\", and their fourth WWF-UK commission \"Arabica\", inspired by a conference Conlon attended about world economics. \"Arabica\" is a musical about the coffee industry and the people involved in the growing, producing and selling of it. This was premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School with narration by actor Burt Caesar. \"Arabica\" is arguably the most musically complex of their shows, and most controversial, and has never been broadcast.\n\nThere was question whether they would write another large-scale musical after \"Arabica\", but in 2000 they wrote \"Song of Creation\" to celebrate the millennium. \"Song of Creation\", unlike their WWF musicals, was written for the catholic charity CAFOD, and premiered at the Royal Festival Hall, London. However, they kept their regular blueprint of writing for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band. The original production of \"Song of Creation\" was narrated by Mary Miller, who also narrated their \"African Jigsaw\" in 1986.\n\nBy contrast to their WWF musicals, \"Song of Creation\" has no story as such, yet explores the wonders of creation and of human initiative, at the same time addressing the question of human responsibility for this human drive. Effectively, Rose and Conlon's latest work completes their cycle of environmental musicals by exploring the whole of the world in which we live; the natural balances that occur (which are also explored particularly in \"Yanomamo\" with regards to the rainforest), and the linking together of Western and Developing cultures (which is a theme that runs throughout their work, especially in \"African Jigsaw\").\n\nTwo new works by Rose and Conlon premiered in 2009. The first, commissioned by Children's International Voices of Enfield, is a smaller piece, \"Caledonian Shadows\", and was performed in London on Sunday 15 March. The second work is a full-length WWF-Commission, \"One Sun, One World\" and was performed at the Royal Albert Hall at the end of the year.\n\nThey were both appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to musical education and conservation.\n\n"}
{"id": "24975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24975", "title": "Piezoelectricity", "text": "Piezoelectricity\n\nPiezoelectricity is the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials (such as crystals, certain ceramics, and biological matter such as bone, DNA and various proteins) in response to applied mechanical stress. The word \"piezoelectricity\" means electricity resulting from pressure and latent heat. It is derived from the Greek word ; \"piezein\", which means to squeeze or press, and \"ēlektron\", which means amber, an ancient source of electric charge. French physicists Jacques and Pierre Curie discovered piezoelectricity in 1880.\n\nThe piezoelectric effect results from the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and electrical states in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry. The piezoelectric effect is a reversible process: materials exhibiting the piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied mechanical force) also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect, the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field. For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension. Conversely, those same crystals will change about 0.1% of their static dimension when an external electric field is applied to the material. The inverse piezoelectric effect is used in the production of ultrasonic sound waves.\n\nPiezoelectricity is exploited in a number of useful applications, such as the production and detection of sound, piezoelectric inkjet printing, generation of high voltages, electronic frequency generation, microbalances, to drive an ultrasonic nozzle, and ultrafine focusing of optical assemblies. It forms the basis for a number of scientific instrumental techniques with atomic resolution, the scanning probe microscopies, such as STM, AFM, MTA, and SNOM. It also finds everyday uses such as acting as the ignition source for cigarette lighters, and push-start propane barbecues, as well as being used as the time reference source in quartz watches.\n\nThe pyroelectric effect, by which a material generates an electric potential in response to a temperature change, was studied by Carl Linnaeus and Franz Aepinus in the mid-18th century. Drawing on this knowledge, both René Just Haüy and Antoine César Becquerel posited a relationship between mechanical stress and electric charge; however, experiments by both proved inconclusive.\n\nThe first demonstration of the direct piezoelectric effect was in 1880 by the brothers Pierre Curie and Jacques Curie. They combined their knowledge of pyroelectricity with their understanding of the underlying crystal structures that gave rise to pyroelectricity to predict crystal behavior, and demonstrated the effect using crystals of tourmaline, quartz, topaz, cane sugar, and Rochelle salt (sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate). Quartz and Rochelle salt exhibited the most piezoelectricity.\n\nThe Curies, however, did not predict the converse piezoelectric effect. The converse effect was mathematically deduced from fundamental thermodynamic principles by Gabriel Lippmann in 1881. The Curies immediately confirmed the existence of the converse effect, and went on to obtain quantitative proof of the complete reversibility of electro-elasto-mechanical deformations in piezoelectric crystals.\n\nFor the next few decades, piezoelectricity remained something of a laboratory curiosity. More work was done to explore and define the crystal structures that exhibited piezoelectricity. This culminated in 1910 with the publication of Woldemar Voigt's \"Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik\" (\"Textbook on Crystal Physics\"), which described the 20 natural crystal classes capable of piezoelectricity, and rigorously defined the piezoelectric constants using tensor analysis.\n\nThe first practical application for piezoelectric devices was sonar, first developed during World War I. In France in 1917, Paul Langevin and his coworkers developed an ultrasonic submarine detector. The detector consisted of a transducer, made of thin quartz crystals carefully glued between two steel plates, and a hydrophone to detect the returned echo. By emitting a high-frequency pulse from the transducer, and measuring the amount of time it takes to hear an echo from the sound waves bouncing off an object, one can calculate the distance to that object.\n\nThe use of piezoelectricity in sonar, and the success of that project, created intense development interest in piezoelectric devices. Over the next few decades, new piezoelectric materials and new applications for those materials were explored and developed.\n\nPiezoelectric devices found homes in many fields. Ceramic phonograph cartridges simplified player design, were cheap and accurate, and made record players cheaper to maintain and easier to build. The development of the ultrasonic transducer allowed for easy measurement of viscosity and elasticity in fluids and solids, resulting in huge advances in materials research. Ultrasonic time-domain reflectometers (which send an ultrasonic pulse through a material and measure reflections from discontinuities) could find flaws inside cast metal and stone objects, improving structural safety.\n\nDuring World War II, independent research groups in the United States, Russia, and Japan discovered a new class of synthetic materials, called ferroelectrics, which exhibited piezoelectric constants many times higher than natural materials. This led to intense research to develop barium titanate and later lead zirconate titanate materials with specific properties for particular applications.\n\nOne significant example of the use of piezoelectric crystals was developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories. Following World War I, Frederick R. Lack, working in radio telephony in the engineering department, developed the “AT cut” crystal, a crystal that operated through a wide range of temperatures. Lack's crystal didn't need the heavy accessories previous crystal used, facilitating its use on aircraft. This development allowed Allied air forces to engage in coordinated mass attacks through the use of aviation radio.\n\nDevelopment of piezoelectric devices and materials in the United States was kept within the companies doing the development, mostly due to the wartime beginnings of the field, and in the interests of securing profitable patents. New materials were the first to be developed — quartz crystals were the first commercially exploited piezoelectric material, but scientists searched for higher-performance materials. Despite the advances in materials and the maturation of manufacturing processes, the United States market did not grow as quickly as Japan's did. Without many new applications, the growth of the United States' piezoelectric industry suffered.\n\nIn contrast, Japanese manufacturers shared their information, quickly overcoming technical and manufacturing challenges and creating new markets. In Japan, a temperature stable crystal cut was developed by Issac Koga. Japanese efforts in materials research created piezoceramic materials competitive to the United States materials but free of expensive patent restrictions. Major Japanese piezoelectric developments included new designs of piezoceramic filters for radios and televisions, piezo buzzers and audio transducers that can connect directly to electronic circuits, and the piezoelectric igniter, which generates sparks for small engine ignition systems and gas-grill lighters, by compressing a ceramic disc. Ultrasonic transducers that transmit sound waves through air had existed for quite some time but first saw major commercial use in early television remote controls. These transducers now are mounted on several car models as an echolocation device, helping the driver determine the distance from the car to any objects that may be in its path.\n\nThe nature of the piezoelectric effect is closely related to the occurrence of electric dipole moments in solids. The latter may either be induced for ions on crystal lattice sites with asymmetric charge surroundings (as in BaTiO and PZTs) or may directly be carried by molecular groups (as in cane sugar). The dipole density or polarization (dimensionality [C·m/m] ) may easily be calculated for crystals by summing up the dipole moments per volume of the crystallographic unit cell. As every dipole is a vector, the dipole density P is a vector field. Dipoles near each other tend to be aligned in regions called Weiss domains. The domains are usually randomly oriented, but can be aligned using the process of \"poling\" (not the same as magnetic poling), a process by which a strong electric field is applied across the material, usually at elevated temperatures. Not all piezoelectric materials can be poled.\n\nOf decisive importance for the piezoelectric effect is the change of polarization P when applying a mechanical stress. This might either be caused by a reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by re-orientation of molecular dipole moments under the influence of the external stress. Piezoelectricity may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on: 1. the orientation of P within the crystal; 2. crystal symmetry; and 3. the applied mechanical stress. The change in P appears as a variation of surface charge density upon the crystal faces, i.e. as a variation of the electric field extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk. For example, a 1 cm cube of quartz with 2 kN (500 lbf) of correctly applied force can produce a voltage of 12500 V.\n\nPiezoelectric materials also show the opposite effect, called the converse piezoelectric effect, where the application of an electrical field creates mechanical deformation in the crystal.\n\nLinear piezoelectricity is the combined effect of\n\nThese may be combined into so-called \"coupled equations\", of which the strain-charge form is:\nIn matrix form,\nwhere [\"d\"] is the matrix for the direct piezoelectric effect and [\"d\"] is the matrix for the converse piezoelectric effect. The superscript \"E\" indicates a zero, or constant, electric field; the superscript \"T\" indicates a zero, or constant, stress field; and the superscript t stands for transposition of a matrix.\n\nNotice that the third order tensor formula_7 maps vectors into symmetric matrices. There are no non-trivial rotation-invariant tensors that have this property, which is why there are no isotropic piezoelectric materials.\n\nThe strain-charge for a material of the 4mm (C) crystal class (such as a poled piezoelectric ceramic such as tetragonal PZT or BaTiO) as well as the 6mm crystal class may also be written as (ANSI IEEE 176):\n\nwhere the first equation represents the relationship for the converse piezoelectric effect and the latter for the direct piezoelectric effect.\n\nAlthough the above equations are the most used form in literature, some comments about the notation are necessary. Generally, \"D\" and \"E\" are vectors, that is, Cartesian tensors of rank 1; and permittivity \"ε\" is a Cartesian tensor of rank 2. Strain and stress are, in principle, also rank-2 tensors. But conventionally, because strain and stress are all symmetric tensors, the subscript of strain and stress can be relabeled in the following fashion: 11 → 1; 22 → 2; 33 → 3; 23 → 4; 13 → 5; 12 → 6. (Different conventions may be used by different authors in literature. For example, some use 12 → 4; 23 → 5; 31 → 6 instead.) That is why \"S\" and \"T\" appear to have the \"vector form\" of six components. Consequently, \"s\" appears to be a 6-by-6 matrix instead of a rank-3 tensor. Such a relabeled notation is often called Voigt notation. Whether the shear strain components \"S\", \"S\", \"S\" are tensor components or engineering strains is another question. In the equation above, they must be engineering strains for the 6,6 coefficient of the compliance matrix to be written as shown, i.e., 2(\"s\" − \"s\"). Engineering shear strains are double the value of the corresponding tensor shear, such as \"S\" = 2\"S\" and so on. This also means that \"s\" = , where \"G\" is the shear modulus.\n\nIn total, there are four piezoelectric coefficients, \"d\", \"e\", \"g\", and \"h\" defined as follows:\n\nwhere the first set of four terms corresponds to the direct piezoelectric effect and the second set of four terms corresponds to the converse piezoelectric effect. For those piezoelectric crystals for which the polarization is of the crystal-field induced type, a formalism has been worked out that allows for the calculation of piezoelectrical coefficients \"d\" from electrostatic lattice constants or higher-order Madelung constants.\n\nOf the 32 crystal classes, 21 are non-centrosymmetric (not having a centre of symmetry), and of these, 20 exhibit direct piezoelectricity (the 21st is the cubic class 432). Ten of these represent the polar crystal classes, which show a spontaneous polarization without mechanical stress due to a non-vanishing electric dipole moment associated with their unit cell, and which exhibit pyroelectricity. If the dipole moment can be reversed by applying an external electric field, the material is said to be ferroelectric.\n\nFor polar crystals, for which P ≠ 0 holds without applying a mechanical load, the piezoelectric effect manifests itself by changing the magnitude or the direction of P or both.\n\nFor the nonpolar but piezoelectric crystals, on the other hand, a polarization P different from zero is only elicited by applying a mechanical load. For them the stress can be imagined to transform the material from a nonpolar crystal class (P = 0) to a polar one, having P ≠ 0.\n\nMany materials, both natural and synthetic, exhibit piezoelectricity:\n\n\nThe action of piezoelectricity in Topaz can probably be attributed to ordering of the (F,OH) in its lattice, which is otherwise centrosymmetric: orthorhombic bipyramidal (mmm). Topaz has anomalous optical properties which are attributed to such ordering.\n\nDry bone exhibits some piezoelectric properties. Studies of Fukada \"et al.\" showed that these are not due to the apatite crystals, which are centrosymmetric, thus non-piezoelectric, but due to collagen. Collagen exhibits the polar uniaxial orientation of molecular dipoles in its structure and can be considered as bioelectret, a sort of dielectric material exhibiting quasipermanent space charge and dipolar charge. Potentials are thought to occur when a number of collagen molecules are stressed in the same way displacing significant numbers of the charge carriers from the inside to the surface of the specimen. Piezoelectricity of single individual collagen fibrils was measured using piezoresponse force microscopy, and it was shown that collagen fibrils behave predominantly as shear piezoelectric materials.\n\nThe piezoelectric effect is generally thought to act as a biological force sensor. This effect was exploited by research conducted at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which established that sustained application of electrical potential could stimulate both resorption and growth (depending on the polarity) of bone in-vivo. Further studies in the 1990s provided the mathematical equation to confirm long bone wave propagation as to that of hexagonal (Class 6) crystals.\n\nBiological materials exhibiting piezoelectric properties include:\n\n\nCeramics with randomly oriented grains must be ferroelectric to exhibit piezoelectricity. The macroscopic piezoelectricity is possible in textured polycrystalline non-ferroelectric piezoelectric materials, such as AlN and ZnO. \nThe family of ceramics with perovskite, tungsten-bronze and related structures exhibits piezoelectricity:\n\nMore recently, there is growing concern regarding the toxicity in lead-containing devices driven by the result of restriction of hazardous substances directive regulations. To address this concern, there has been a resurgence in the compositional development of lead-free piezoelectric materials.\nSo far, neither the environmental effect nor the stability of supplying these substances have been measured.\n\nA piezoelectric potential can be created in any bulk or nanostructured semiconductor crystal having non central symmetry, such as the Group III–V and II–VI materials, due to polarization of ions under applied stress and strain. This property is common to both the zincblende and wurtzite crystal structures. To first order, there is only one independent piezoelectric coefficient in zincblende, called e, coupled to shear components of the strain. In wurtzite, there are instead three independent piezoelectric coefficients: \"e\", \"e\" and \"e\".\nThe semiconductors where the strongest piezoelectricity is observed are those commonly found in the wurtzite structure, i.e. GaN, InN, AlN and ZnO. ZnO is the most used material in the recent field of piezotronics.\n\nSince 2006, there have also been a number of reports of strong non linear piezoelectric effects in polar semiconductors.\nSuch effects are generally recognized to be at least important if not of the same order of magnitude as the first order approximation.\n\nThe piezo-response of polymers is not as high as the response for ceramics; however, polymers hold properties that ceramics don't. Over the last few decades, non-toxic, piezoelectric polymers have been studied and applied due to their flexibility and smaller acoustical impedance. Other properties that make these materials significant include their biocompatibility, biodegradability, low cost, and low power consumption compared to other piezo-materials (ceramics, etc.). Piezoelectric polymers and non-toxic polymer composites can be used given their different physical properties.\n\nPiezoelectric polymers can be classified by bulk polymers, voided charged polymers, and polymer composites. A piezo-response observed by bulk polymers is mostly due to its molecular structure. There are two types of bulk polymers: amorphous and semi-crystalline. Examples of semi-crystalline polymers are Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) and its copolymers, Polyamides, and Paralyne-C. Non-crystalline polymers, such as Polyimide and Polyvinylidene Chloride (PVDC), fall under amorphous bulk polymers. Voided charged polymers exhibit the piezoelectric effect due to charge induced by poling of a porous polymeric film. Under an electric field, charges form on the surface of the voids forming dipoles. Electric responses can be caused by any deformation of these voids. The piezoelectric effect can also be observed in polymer composites by integrating piezoelectric ceramic particles into a polymer film. A polymer doesn’t have to be piezo-active to be an effective material for a polymer composite. In this case, a material could be made up of an inert matrix with a separate piezo-active component.\n\nPVDF exhibits piezoelectricity several times greater than quartz. The piezo-response observed from PVDF is about 20-30 pC/N. That is an order of 5-50 times less than that of piezoelectric ceramic lead zirconate titanate (PZT). The thermal stability of the piezoelectric effect of polymers in the PVDF family (ie. vinylidene fluoride co-poly trifluoroethylene) goes up to 125°C. Some applications of PVDF are pressure sensors, hydrophones, and shock wave sensors.\n\nDue to their flexibility, piezoelectric composites have been proposed as energy harvesters and nanogenerators. In 2018, it was reported by Zhu et al. that a piezoelectric response of about 17 pC/N could be obtained from PDMS/PZT nanocomposite at 60% porosity. Another PDMS nanocomposite was reported in 2017, in which BaTiO3 was integrated into PDMS to make a stretchable, transparent nanogenerator for self-powered physiological monitoring. In 2016, polar molecules were introduced into a polyurethane foam in which high responses of up to 244 pC/N were reported.\n\nIn 2000, it was shown that an actuator can be made of paper. The wood fibers, called cellulose fibers, are aligned so that there is a dipolar orientation. This allows the material to become piezoelectric. To enhance the effect, the material can be poled for further alignment. D33 responses for cellular polypropylene are around 200 pC/N. Some applications of cellular polypropylene are musical key pads, microphones, and ultrasound-based echolocation systems.\n\nA strong shear piezoelectric activity was observed in self-assembled diphenylalanine peptide nanotubes (PNTs), indicating electric polarization directed along the tube axis. Comparison with LiNbO and lateral signal calibration yields sufficiently high effective piezoelectric coefficient values of at least 60 pm/V (shear response for tubes of ≈200 nm in diameter). PNTs demonstrate linear deformation without irreversible degradation in a broad range of driving voltages.\n\nCurrently, industrial and manufacturing is the largest application market for piezoelectric devices, followed by the automotive industry. Strong demand also comes from medical instruments as well as information and telecommunications. The global demand for piezoelectric devices was valued at approximately US$14.8 billion in 2010. The largest material group for piezoelectric devices is piezoceramics, and piezopolymer is experiencing the fastest growth due to its low weight and small size.\n\nPiezoelectric crystals are now used in numerous ways:\n\nDirect piezoelectricity of some substances, like quartz, can generate potential differences of thousands of volts.\n\n\nThe principle of operation of a piezoelectric sensor is that a physical dimension, transformed into a force, acts on two opposing faces of the sensing element. Depending on the design of a sensor, different \"modes\" to load the piezoelectric element can be used: longitudinal, transversal and shear.\n\nDetection of pressure variations in the form of sound is the most common sensor application, e.g. piezoelectric microphones (sound waves bend the piezoelectric material, creating a changing voltage) and piezoelectric pickups for acoustic-electric guitars. A piezo sensor attached to the body of an instrument is known as a contact microphone.\n\nPiezoelectric sensors especially are used with high frequency sound in ultrasonic transducers for medical imaging and also industrial nondestructive testing (NDT).\n\nFor many sensing techniques, the sensor can act as both a sensor and an actuator – often the term \"transducer\" is preferred when the device acts in this dual capacity, but most piezo devices have this property of reversibility whether it is used or not. Ultrasonic transducers, for example, can inject ultrasound waves into the body, receive the returned wave, and convert it to an electrical signal (a voltage). Most medical ultrasound transducers are piezoelectric.\n\nIn addition to those mentioned above, various sensor applications include:\n\n\nAs very high electric fields correspond to only tiny changes in the width of the crystal, this width can be changed with better-than-µm precision, making piezo crystals the most important tool for positioning objects with extreme accuracy — thus their use in actuators.\nMultilayer ceramics, using layers thinner than , allow reaching high electric fields with voltage lower than . These ceramics are used within two kinds of actuators: direct piezo actuators and Amplified piezoelectric actuators. While direct actuator's stroke is generally lower than , amplified piezo actuators can reach millimeter strokes.\n\nThe piezoelectrical properties of quartz are useful as a standard of frequency.\n\n\nTypes of piezoelectric motor include:\n\nAside from the stepping stick-slip motor, all these motors work on the same principle. Driven by dual orthogonal vibration modes with a phase difference of 90°, the contact point between two surfaces vibrates in an elliptical path, producing a frictional force between the surfaces. Usually, one surface is fixed, causing the other to move. In most piezoelectric motors, the piezoelectric crystal is excited by a sine wave signal at the resonant frequency of the motor. Using the resonance effect, a much lower voltage can be used to produce a high vibration amplitude.\n\nA stick-slip motor works using the inertia of a mass and the friction of a clamp. Such motors can be very small. Some are used for camera sensor displacement, thus allowing an anti-shake function.\n\nDifferent teams of researchers have been investigating ways to reduce vibrations in materials by attaching piezo elements to the material. When the material is bent by a vibration in one direction, the vibration-reduction system responds to the bend and sends electric power to the piezo element to bend in the other direction. Future applications of this technology are expected in cars and houses to reduce noise. Further applications to flexible structures, such as shells and plates, have also been studied for nearly three decades.\n\nIn a demonstration at the Material Vision Fair in Frankfurt in November 2005, a team from TU Darmstadt in Germany showed several panels that were hit with a rubber mallet, and the panel with the piezo element immediately stopped swinging.\n\nPiezoelectric ceramic fiber technology is being used as an electronic damping system on some HEAD tennis rackets.\n\nIn people with previous total fertilization failure, piezoelectric activation of oocytes together with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) seems to improve fertilization outcomes.\n\nA recent application of piezoelectric ultrasound sources is piezoelectric surgery, also known as piezosurgery. Piezosurgery is a minimally invasive technique that aims to cut a target tissue with little damage to neighboring tissues. For example, Hoigne \"et al.\" reported its use in hand surgery for the cutting of bone, using frequencies in the range 25–29 kHz, causing microvibrations of 60–210 μm. It has the ability to cut mineralized tissue without cutting neurovascular tissue and other soft tissue, thereby maintaining a blood-free operating area, better visibility and greater precision.\n\nIn 2015, Cambridge University researchers working in conjunction with researchers from the National Physical Laboratory and Cambridge-based dielectric antenna company Antenova Ltd, using thin films of piezoelectric materials found that at a certain frequency, these materials become not only efficient resonators, but efficient radiators as well, meaning that they can potentially be used as antennas. The researchers found that by subjecting the piezoelectric thin films to an asymmetric excitation, the symmetry of the system is similarly broken, resulting in a corresponding symmetry breaking of the electric field, and the generation of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nIn recent years, several attempts at the macro-scale application of the piezoelectric technology have emerged to harvest kinetic energy from walking pedestrians. The piezoelectric floors have been trialed since the beginning of 2007 in two Japanese train stations, Tokyo and Shibuya stations. The electricity generated from the foot traffic is used to provide all the electricity needed to run the automatic ticket gates and electronic display systems. In London, a famous nightclub exploited the piezoelectric technology in its dance floor. Parts of the lighting and sound systems in the club can be powered by the energy harvesting tiles. However, the piezoelectric tile deployed on the ground usually harvests energy from low frequency strikes provided by the foot traffic. This working condition may eventually lead to low power generation efficiency.\n\nIn this case, locating high traffic areas is critical for optimization of the energy harvesting efficiency, as well as the orientation of the tile pavement significantly affects the total amount of the harvested energy. A density flow evaluation is recommended to qualitatively evaluate the piezoelectric power harvesting potential of the considered area based on the number of pedestrian crossings per unit time. In X. Li's study, the potential application of a commercial piezoelectric energy harvester in a central hub building at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia is examined and discussed. Optimization of the piezoelectric tile deployment is presented according to the frequency of pedestrian mobility and a model is developed where 3.1% of the total floor area with the highest pedestrian mobility is paved with piezoelectric tiles. The modelling results indicate that the total annual energy harvesting potential for the proposed optimized tile pavement model is estimated at 1.1 MW h/year, which would be sufficient to meet close to 0.5% of the annual energy needs of the building. In Israel, there is a company which has installed piezoelectric materials under a busy highway. The energy generated is adequate and powers street lights, billboards and signs.\n\nTire company Goodyear has plans to develop an electricity generating tire which has piezoelectric material lined inside it. As the tire moves, it deforms and thus electricity is generated.\n\nThe efficiency of a hybrid photovoltaic cell that contains piezoelectric materials can be increased simply by placing it near a source of ambient noise or vibration. The effect was demonstrated with organic cells using zinc oxide nanotubes. The electricity generated by the piezoelectric effect itself is a negligible percentage of the overall output. Sound levels as low as 75 decibels improved efficiency by up to 50%. Efficiency peaked at 10 kHz, the resonant frequency of the nanotubes. The electrical field set up by the vibrating nanotubes interacts with electrons migrating from the organic polymer layer. This process decreases the likelihood of recombination, in which electrons are energized but settle back into a hole instead of migrating to the electron-accepting ZnO layer.\n\n\n"}

Kline was the former President of the National Academy of Public Administration; former Deputy and Acting Administrator, General Services Administration (GSA); and former Associate Administrator, Management Operations, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n\nKline was born in the town of New Ringgold, Pennsylvania to Rev. Raymond Adam Kline and Marie (Herb). He, and his three sisters, were raised by their mother after their father died in 1936 from respiratory complications brought on by mustard gas exposure in World War I. Economic circumstances after Rev. Kline's death compelled the family to move to the Lutheran Orphans Home in Topton, PA. Kline, along with his mother Marie and three sisters, Helen, Marguerite and Yvonne, lived for two years at the orphanage from 1938 to 1940. Kline attended Lebanon High School in Lebanon, PA from 1941 to 1944 where he was actively involved in academic clubs and sports. After graduating high school, Kline attended the Virginia Military Institute in the Army Specialized Training Program in 1944. He then volunteered in the U.S. Army during World War II, serving in active duty as Staff Sergeant and platoon leader, 1st Division, 26th Infantry Regiment in the European theater from 1944 to 1946. While in Germany, he stood guard at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals. Kline attended Lebanon Valley College from 1946 to 1950 on the G.I. Bill and graduated with an A.B. degree in political science (Pi Gamma Mu). Kline was later recalled back to the U.S. Army during the Korean War and served in the Military Police Corps from 1950 to 1951. After his years in military service, Kline took on various jobs including working as a police officer in Ocean City, Maryland. Kline attended George Washington University School of Public Administration at night from 1952 to 1954 and fell short of his master's degree when he learned that his thesis topic had already been taken. His work and law school superseded efforts to complete the thesis. From 1954 to 1957, Kline attended George Washington University Law School and graduated with a LLB degree (Phi Delta Phi). The law degree fulfilled a promise that Kline made to his father just prior to his death. Kline was admitted to the Bar of the District of Columbia in 1958. In 1959, he was admitted to Federal Bar Association. He later received Honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from both George Washington University (1982) and Lebanon Valley College (1990).\n\nKline enjoyed a long career in public service in Washington, D.C.. His career began at the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships from 1952 to 1956. After studying law in Washington, DC, he moved to Huntsville, AL. where he was employed by the Army Missile Command (Redstone Arsenal). Kline became a Management Analyst at Army Missile Command in 1958. While in Huntsville, he taught Political Science at the University of Alabama 1958-1963. He was recruited by NASA to serve as principal staff advisor to Dr. Wernher von Braun in the Executive Staff for the Management Development office during the Apollo era at the newly formed George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville from 1962 to 1968. During the time of the first United States manned missions in space, Kline served, among other duties, as von Braun's congressional speech writer. A notable speech included the often repeated phrase \"the moon is our Paris,\" written for the Fourth National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space in 1964. Kline maintained several close ties with the astronauts and staff involved in the early moon missions. Kline moved back to the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC in a new capacity at NASA as the Associate Administrator for Management Operations from 1968 to 1979. Kline remained involved with space exploration and manned space missions, which became a lifelong passion. After his tenure at NASA, Kline took the job of Deputy Administrator at GSA from 1979 to 1985 and was GSA's Acting Administrator 1981, 1984-1985. In 1982, Kline was awarded the Presidential rank of Distinguished Senior Executive by President Reagan. As Acting Administrator of GSA, Kline worked to restore independence of the National Archives from GSA and directly contributed to passage of the National Archives and Records Administration Act of 1984. After his retirement in 1985 from public service after 33 years in the Federal government, Kline became President of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), a non-partisan, nonprofit corporation established in 1967 and chartered by Congress to provide research and counsel to increase the effectiveness of American government at all levels. Kline served as NAPA's president from 1985 to 1992. During this time at NAPA, Kline appeared before several congressional committees to provide testimony on various topics. Since retirement in 1992, Kline was voted onto the Board of the Kerr Foundation, a non-profit charitable and educational organization in Oklahoma, where he served until 2009. Kline also served on other boards including the Procurement Round Table and the Roger W. Jones Award for Executive Leadership at American University. Kline also holds the top awards from three Federal agencies: the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, the GSA Distinguished Service Award and the Archivists' Distinguished Service Award from the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nAfter retiring in 1992, Kline remained in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., serving on several advisory boards. He enjoyed his family, travel, and various intellectual pursuits. Kline married Jeanelle Batley April 26, 1958, and they had two children: Robin Jeanelle (b. 1962) Raymond Ashley (b. 1969).\n\n"}

The names are intended to reduce confusion in the event of concurrent storms in the same basin. Generally once storms produce sustained wind speeds of more than , names are assigned in order from predetermined lists depending on which basin they originate. However, standards vary from basin to basin: some tropical depressions are named in the Western Pacific, while tropical cyclones must have a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the centre before they are named in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nBefore the formal start of naming, tropical cyclones were named after places, objects, or saints' feast days on which they occurred. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived in the latter part of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes and naming lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins, as well as the Australian region, Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean.\n\nBefore the formal start of naming, tropical cyclones were often named after places, objects, or saints' feast days on which they occurred. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the North Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.\n\nAt present, tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven warning centers and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to facilitate the effective communication of forecasts and storm-related hazards to the general public. This is especially important when multiple storms are occurring simultaneously in the same ocean basin. Names are generally assigned in order from predetermined lists, once they produce one, three, or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than . However, standards vary from basin to basin, with some systems named in the Western Pacific when they develop into tropical depressions or enter PAGASA's area of responsibility. Within the Southern Hemisphere, systems must be characterized by a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the center before they are named.\n\nAny member of the World Meteorological Organization's hurricane, typhoon and tropical cyclone committees can request that the name of a tropical cyclone be retired or withdrawn from the various tropical cyclone naming lists. A name is retired or withdrawn if a consensus or majority of members agree that the system has acquired a special notoriety, such as causing a large number of deaths and amounts of damage, impact, or for other special reasons. A replacement name is then submitted to the committee concerned and voted upon, but these names can be rejected and replaced with another name for various reasons: these reasons include the spelling and pronunciation of the name, the similarity to the name of a recent tropical cyclone or on another list of names, and the length of the name for modern communication channels such as social media. PAGASA also retires the names of significant tropical cyclones when they have caused at least in damage or have caused at least 300 deaths.\n\nWithin the North Atlantic Ocean, tropical or subtropical cyclones are named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC/RSMC Miami) when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least . There are six lists of names which rotate every six years and begin with the first letters A—W used, skipping Q and U, and alternating between male and female names. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization's Hurricane Committee meeting. If all of the names on a list are used, storms are named after the letters of the Greek alphabet.\n\nWithin the Eastern Pacific Ocean, there are two warning centers that assign names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least . Tropical cyclones that intensify into tropical storms between the coast of Americas and 140°W are named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC/RSMC Miami), while tropical cyclones intensifying into tropical storms between 140°W and 180° are named by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC/RSMC Honolulu). Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists and a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Hurricane Committee.\n\nThe current naming scheme began with the 1978 season, one year before the Atlantic basin (and which anomalously used the list that will be used next in 2018, rather than the one for 2020). As with the Atlantic basin, it uses alternating women's and men's names, and also includes some Spanish and a few French names. Before then, only women's names were used. Because Eastern Pacific hurricanes mainly threaten western Mexico and Central America, the lists contain more Spanish names than the Atlantic lists.\n\nWhen a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the Equator between the coastline of the Americas and 140°W, it will be named by the NHC. There are six lists of names which rotate every six years and begin with the letters A—Z used, skipping Q and U, with each name alternating between a male or a female name. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization's Hurricane Committee. If all of the names on a list are used, storms are named using the letters of the Greek alphabet.\n\nWhen a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the Equator between 140°W and 180°, it is named by the CPHC. Four lists of Hawaiian names are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization's hurricane committee, rotating without regard to year, with the first name for a new year being the next name in sequence that was not used the previous year. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next Hurricane Committee meeting.\n\nTropical cyclones that occur within the Northern Hemisphere between the anti-meridian and 100°E are officially named by the Japan Meteorological Agency when they become tropical storms. However, PAGASA also names tropical cyclones that occur or develop into tropical depressions within their self-defined area of responsibility between 5°N–25°N and 115°E-135°E. This often results in tropical cyclones in the region having two names.\n\nTropical cyclones within the Western Pacific are assigned international names by the JMA when they become a tropical storm with 10-minute sustained winds of at least . The names are used sequentially without regard to year and are taken from five lists of names that were prepared by the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee, after each of the 14 members submitted 10 names in 1998. The order of the names to be used was determined by placing the English name of the members in alphabetical order. Members of the committee are allowed to request the retirement or replacement of a system's name if it causes extensive destruction or for other reasons such as number of deaths. Unlike other basins, storms are also named after plants, animals, objects, and mythological beings.\n\nSince 1963, PAGASA has independently operated its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones that occur within its own self-defined Philippine Area of Responsibility. The names are taken from four different lists of 25 names and are assigned when a system moves into or develops into a tropical depression within PAGASA's jurisdiction. The four lists of names are rotated every four years, with the names of significant tropical cyclones retired should they have caused at least in damage and or at least 300 deaths within the Philippines. Should the list of names for a given year be exhausted, names are taken from an auxiliary list, the first ten of which are published every year.\n\nWithin the North Indian Ocean between 45°E – 100°E, tropical cyclones are named by the India Meteorological Department (IMD/RSMC New Delhi) when they are judged to have intensified into a cyclonic storm with 3-minute sustained wind speeds of at least . There are eight lists of names which are used in sequence and are not rotated every few years; however, the names of significant tropical cyclones are retired.\n\nWithin the South-West Indian Ocean in the Southern Hemisphere between Africa and 90°E, a tropical or subtropical disturbance is named when it is judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least . This is defined as being when gales are either observed or estimated to be present near a significant portion of the system's center. Systems are named in conjunction with Météo-France Reunion by either Météo Madagascar or the Mauritius Meteorological Service. If a disturbance reaches the naming stage between Africa and 55°E, then Météo Madagascar names it; if it reaches the naming stage between 55°E and 90°E, then the Mauritius Meteorological Service names it. The names are taken from three pre-determined lists of names, which rotate on a triennial basis, with any names that have been used automatically removed. The names that are going to be used during a season are selected in advance by the World Meteorological Organization's RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee from names submitted by member countries.\n\nWithin the Australian region in the Southern Hemisphere between 90°E – 160°E, a tropical cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis indicate that a system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue. The Indonesian Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 90°E and 141°E, while Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 141°E and 160°E. Outside of these areas, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology names systems that develop into tropical cyclones. In order to enable local authorities and their communities in taking action to reduce the impact of a tropical cyclone, each of these warning centres reserve the right to name a system early if it has a high chance of being named. If a name is assigned to a tropical cyclone that causes loss of life or significant damage and disruption to the way of life of a community, then the name assigned to that storm is retired from the list of names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting.\n\nIf a system intensifies into a tropical cyclone between the Equator-10°S and 90°E-141°E, it will be named by the Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika (BMKG/TCWC Jakarta). Names are assigned in sequence from list A, while list B details names that will replace names on list A that are retired or removed for other reasons.\n\nIf a system intensifies into a tropical cyclone between the Equator – 10°S and 141°E – 160°E, then it will be named by Papua New Guinea National Weather Service (NWS, TCWC Port Moresby). Names are assigned in sequence from list A and are automatically retired after being used regardless of any damage caused. List B contains names that will replace names on list A that are retired or removed for other reasons.\n\nWhen a system develops into a tropical cyclone below 10°S between 90°E and 160°E, then it will be named by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) which operates three Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane. The names are assigned in alphabetical order and used in rotating order without regard to year.\n\nWithin the Southern Pacific basin in the Southern Hemisphere between 160°E – 120°W, a tropical cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis indicate that a system has gale force or stronger winds near the centre which are forecast to continue. The Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) names systems that are located between the Equator and 25°S, while the New Zealand MetService names systems (in conjunction with the FMS) that develop to the south of 25°S. In order to enable local authorities and their communities in taking action to reduce the impact of a tropical cyclone, the FMS reserves the right to name a system early if it has a high chance of being named. If a tropical cyclone causes loss of life or significant damage and disruption to the way of life of a community, then the name assigned to that cyclone is retired from the list of names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting. The name of a tropical cyclone is determined by using Lists A — D in order, without regard to the year before restarting with List A. List E contains names that will replace names on A-D when needed.\n\nWhen a tropical or subtropical storm exists in the South Atlantic Ocean, the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center's Serviço Meteorológico Marinho names the system using a predetermined list of names. The names are assigned in alphabetical order and used in rotating order without regard to year.\n\n\n"}

Less certainly, the term tylosis is in use to summarise the physiological process and the resulting occlusion in the xylem of woody plants as response to injury or as protection from decay in heartwood. \nIt is a key process in wall one of the Compartmentalization Of Decay In Trees (CODIT) and other woody plants.\n\nObserved in section under a microscope, tyloses appear as balloon-like protrusions emanating from axial paratracheal parenchyma cells into xylem vessels through pits linking the two. In some types, there may be a distinct barrier between the tyloses emanating from the pits into the vessels, while they may be barely distinguishable in other cases.\n\nTylosis in narrow vesseled plant vessels counteracts the axial spread of fungal hyphae and other pathogens by slowing down their vertical spread with a physical barrier. A similar process occurs in gymnosperms, which block access to tracheids by closing the pits that join them to each other. \n\nThe blocked vessels also provide a defense against the radial spread of pathogens, limiting their horizontal spread through the plant stem. Protection is stronger at the boundaries where annual rings meet.\n\nThe effectiveness of both vertical and horizontal barriers is affected by the speed at which they are established by tyloses, being typically faster in healthier plants.\n\nAs a tree grows, its cambium adds an annual increment (or ring) of new wood, and in many species of trees the older wood towards the centre of the tree becomes less important for physiological processes like water and nutrient transportation, and this is converted by the tree to heartwood. This heartwood has no active defenses against infection, but is protected from infection and decay by the blockage of the xylem vessels with tyloses and various substances such as gums, resins and waxes containing high concentrations of volatile organic compounds such as terpenes that are toxic to insect larvae and tree pathogens such as bacteria and fungi. These products are produced by the cambium and transported to the centre of the stem by cellular structures called medullary rays radiating from the center of the stem and then enter living axial paratracheal parenchyma cells. As the wood ages, the contents of the parenchyma cell burst into the dead vessel through the pit linking the two. The parenchyma cell then dies as its contents are disgorged into the empty space of the dry vessel and highly effective decay-inhibiting substances, notably tannin, are formed and absorbed by the adjacent vessel walls.\n\n"}
