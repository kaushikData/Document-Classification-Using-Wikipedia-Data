The platform uses a Msta-S chassis with a battery of laser projectors mounted in the turret. It was developed by the Soviet Union in order to disable the optical-electronic equipment of enemy missiles, ground and aerial vehicles.\n\nThe 1K17 Szhatie was developed in the 1970s and 1980s. Although the Soviet Union attempted to keep the plans secret, the Pentagon managed to obtain drawings from defectors. Western intelligence services code named it the Stiletto. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the development of the Szhatie was abandoned, as the development and manufacturing of the laser projection system had become too expensive and unnecessary. Two of these \"tanks\" were tested, with one being scrapped and the other being displayed in the Army Technology Museum near Moscow, but without its laser projector.\n\nThe Russian Armed Forces already have been commissioned some types of laser weaponry, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov said on 2 August 2016. These might be laser systems for jamming tank armament command systems or air defence/anti-missile systems. The first of these laser systems were supplied to the Russian Armed Forces in 2017 according to President Vladimir Putin and Borisov later claimed that these systems are able to destroy hostile targets instantly.\n\nThe \"tank\" used an intense laser beam to disable the optical-electronic equipment of the enemy vehicles. This was created by focusing light through 30 kg of artificial rubies which made the whole system very expensive to produce. The optics that produced the laser were placed at the end of a silver coated spiral which helped amplify the beam and increase convergence. The energy to power the laser was provided by a generator and an auxiliary battery system. The lenses themselves were able to operate in different environments by moving metal caps closer to protect the lens. It was also equipped with a 12.7mm NSV machine gun to defend itself against attacks by infantry and air.\n\nA similar laser system was also developed around the same time named \"Sangvin\", which was based on the ZSU-23-4 self-propelled anti-aircraft gun.\n\n"}

Bugorski was leaning over the equipment when he stuck his head in the path of the 76 GeV proton beam. Reportedly, he saw the flash \"brighter than a thousand suns\" but did not feel any pain.\n\nThe left half of Bugorski's face swelled up beyond recognition and, over the next several days, the skin started to peel, revealing the path that the proton beam (moving near the speed of light) had burned through parts of his face, his bone and the brain tissue underneath. As it was believed that he had received far in excess of a fatal dose of radiation, Bugorski was taken to a clinic in Moscow where the doctors could observe his expected demise. However, Bugorski survived and even completed his Ph.D. There was virtually no damage to his intellectual capacity, but the fatigue of mental work increased markedly. Bugorski completely lost hearing in the left ear, save a moderate case of tinnitus. The left half of his face was paralyzed due to the destruction of nerves. He was able to function well, except for the fact that he had occasional complex partial seizures and rare tonic-clonic seizures.\n\nBugorski continued to work in science and held the post of coordinator of physics experiments. Because of the Soviet Union's policy of maintaining secrecy on nuclear power-related issues, Bugorski did not speak about the accident for over a decade. He continued going to the Moscow radiation clinic twice a year for examinations and to meet with other nuclear-accident victims. He was described as \"a poster boy for Soviet and Russian radiation medicine\". In 1996, he applied unsuccessfully for disabled status to receive free epilepsy medication. Bugorski showed interest in making himself available for study to Western researchers but could not afford to leave Protvino.\n\nBugorski is married to Vera Nikolaevna, and they have a son, Peter.\n\n\n"}

All 15 people on board were killed.\n\nRadio contact was lost about 9 minutes after takeoff, but no reports of a crash were initially received by the authorities. The next day, wreckage and a fuel slick were found on the surface of Botany Bay, Sydney. The aircraft had been drawn into a thunderstorm and subjected to extreme turbulence. It had broken up and crashed into Botany Bay less than from where it took off.\n\nThe loss of Flight 325 was the first fatal accident suffered by Ansett since commencement of operations as Ansett Airways Pty Ltd in 1935.\n\nAnsett-ANA Flight 325, a Vickers Viscount registered VH-TVC \"John Oxley\", took off from Sydney airport on runway 07 at 7:17 pm local time for a scheduled passenger flight to Canberra. The aircraft was being leased from Trans-Australia Airlines in exchange for a DC-6B aircraft. On board were the pilot, Stan Lindsay; co-pilot, Ben Costello; two air hostesses, Aileen Keldie and Elizabeth Hardy; and eleven passengers.\n\nAround the time of takeoff there was a severe thunderstorm with very heavy rain to the south of the airport and another to the north. Above Sydney airport there was cloud at about but no thunderstorm activity. Flight 325 was observed to enter cloud shortly after take off. Five other aircraft took off while this meteorological situation existed.\n\nFlight 325 was directed to take-off and continue heading east towards the Tasman Sea until reaching an altitude of , turn around and fly west to a radio navigation aid west of the airport and then turn south-west for Canberra. The crew were to ensure they passed over the airport no lower than .\n\nFive minutes after takeoff the crew advised they had reached . About 3½ minutes later, Sydney air traffic control called Flight 325 with a routine request for information but received no reply. No further radio communication was received from Flight 325 so when it did not arrive at Canberra airport authorities knew it had suffered an accident. An air search was planned to commence at dawn.\n\nApproximately 9 minutes after takeoff the outer section of the right wing had been torn away and the aircraft had crashed into Botany Bay. The rain, thunder and lightning associated with the thunderstorm over Botany Bay had been so intense that no-one saw the aircraft or observed anything crash into the water. Accident Investigator Frank Yeend wrote \"The weather was so bad that this aircraft crashed in the middle of a major city without anybody having seen it or heard anything that would give cause to alarm.\"\n\nWhen it became clear Flight 325 was not responding to radio calls and the aircraft could not be seen on the radar screen in the control tower the Alert Phase of search and rescue procedures was initiated. The Police, RAAF, Royal Australian Navy and Volunteer Coastal Patrol were notified. A message was broadcast on the radio frequency used by coastal shipping. The Department of Civil Aviation air-sea rescue launch based on Botany Bay made a circuit of the Bay's foreshores. When Flight 325 failed to arrive at its destination, search and rescue procedures were elevated to the Distress Phase. In the hours after loss of contact with Flight 325 no report was received of an aircraft accident so there was general foreboding that it had crashed into the Tasman Sea. At first light the next morning two Douglas DC-3 aircraft began searching the sea to the east of Sydney. A helicopter and several motor launches also began searching Botany Bay.\n\nSoon after sunrise the crew of the helicopter reported an item floating on Botany Bay. The crew of the air-sea rescue launch investigated the sighting and retrieved a piece of damaged upholstery. Airline staff confirmed the upholstery was from a Vickers Viscount pilot's seat. Searchers on the beach in the north-east of Botany Bay, near Bunnerong Power Station, found some cabin furnishings and human remains. At the south of the Bay the outer section of the right wing, still showing registration VH-TVC, was found protruding above the surface of shallow water near Kurnell. Later in the day Police and Navy divers investigated a large fuel slick in the centre of Botany Bay and discovered the scattered wreckage of VH-TVC in of water, north of the outer section of the right wing. The aircraft had crashed south-east of Sydney airport.\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy sent a team of clearance divers and \"HMAS Kimbla\", a boom defence vessel, to Botany Bay and brought the main wreckage of VH-TVC to the surface. After a week \"Kimbla\" was replaced by \"HMAS Walrus\", a smaller workboat from which the Navy divers worked for many weeks, locating and recovering many smaller pieces of wreckage.\n\nThe right tailplane was missing from the main wreckage. Navy divers eventually found the missing parts of the tailplane close to where the outer section of the right wing was found, indicating the right tailplane was also torn from the aircraft prior to its impact with the water.\n\nNumerous small items, including many from the number 4 engine nacelle, were found on Kurnell peninsula, south of the outer section of the right wing. The wreckage trail was aligned approximately north-south with the main wreckage at the north in Botany Bay; and the smaller, lighter items at the south on Kurnell peninsula.\n\nThe aircraft was not equipped with a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder so it was important that as much as possible of the wreckage should be recovered and examined. The recovery effort continued for 3 months.\n\nThe top section of the rudder was not found during the recovery of the wreckage. Twelve years after the accident the missing section was found in shallow water in Botany Bay, near Kurnell Beach.\n\nAs pieces of wreckage from VH-TVC were progressively recovered from Botany Bay they were laid out in a hangar at Sydney airport to allow investigators to search for the cause of the accident. The right tailplane and the outer section of the right wing had received almost no damage on impact with the water but the main wreckage in Botany Bay showed extensive disintegration, suggesting a very high speed of impact. No evidence was found of any fault or mechanical failure that might have existed prior to the accident.\n\nIt soon became clear that the spar in the right wing had broken and the outer section of the wing had been torn away by the airstream. The lower boom (or lower flange) in the wing spar had failed in upward bending at station 323 due to extreme overload. The wing had been overloaded while the aircraft was flying at very high speed, probably in excess of the maximum safe speed of indicated airspeed. As an immediate consequence of the aircraft's gyrations during failure of the right wing, the right tailplane had also been subjected to excessive forces and had separated from the fuselage.\n\nEngineers assisting the accident investigation calculated that for the wing spar to fail in the way it did in VH-TVC would require the aircraft to be flying faster than its maximum speed of and, while being subjected to a severe recovery manoeuvre by the crew, to encounter a very strong gust, possibly as much as . At the time of the accident investigation, gusts up to had been measured inside thunderstorms by suitably equipped research aircraft. Investigators were aware of the crash of Capital Airlines Flight 75, a Vickers Viscount that crashed in Maryland, USA in May 1959 after encountering extreme turbulence associated with thunderstorms.\n\nAll the wreckage lay in a trail aligned north-south. By making assumptions about the likely terminal velocities of key pieces of wreckage, accident investigators were able to determine the approximate location, height and speed of the aircraft at the time it broke up. They believed the outer section of the right wing was torn away when the aircraft was south of its intended flight path, heading in a northerly direction, and at a height between . They believed this occurred at a time when the aircraft should have been at about , heading west and passing over a radio navigation aid nine miles away. It was necessary for the investigation to find a rational explanation as to why the aircraft was so far from where it should have been.\n\nAccident investigators studied a scientific report titled \"The Thunderstorm\" published in the USA in 1949. This report proposed that where two thunderstorms were separated, edge to edge, by less than there was a likelihood of severe turbulence in the clear air between the two. The accident investigators believed it was likely that Flight 325, while flying west between two mature thunderstorms, encountered strong turbulence that caused the crew to lose control and the aircraft to lose a significant amount of height and enter the thunderstorm to the south of the airport. While flying north, possibly in an attempt to escape the thunderstorm, the crew encountered continuing strong turbulence that caused control to be lost again. The aircraft accelerated to its maximum safe speed or faster and while the crew were struggling to regain control the aircraft was suddenly subjected to extreme turbulence that caused the right wing and the right tailplane to fail.\n\nA Board of Accident Inquiry was appointed in 1962 to investigate all aspects of the accident to Flight 325. chairman of the board was Mr Justice Spicer of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The Board first convened on 12 June 1962, sat for 24 days and closed on 27 July 1962.\n\nInvestigation of the accident concluded:\n\n\"The cause of the accident was the failure in flight of the starboard outer wing in upward bending due to tensile overloading of the lower spar boom at station 323, probably induced by a combination of manoeuvre and gust loading when the speed of the aircraft was in excess of 260 knots. The circumstances and available evidence carry a strong implication that the in-flight structural failure was preceded by a loss of control with a consequential increase in speed to at least 260 knots. The most probable explanation for the loss of control is that the aircraft entered an area of unexpected turbulence of such severity as to deprive the pilots of full recovery.\"\n\nThe Inquiry gave a strong impetus for greater co-operation between the meteorological service and air traffic control; and for airline aircraft in Australia to be equipped with weather radar to give pilots of these aircraft the ability to avoid hazardous weather. All Australian airliners were required to be equipped with weather radar by 1 June 1963.\n\nThe aircraft was Vickers Viscount 720, serial number 46. It was registered VH-TVC and first flew on 17 November 1954. It was delivered to Trans Australia Airlines on 8 December 1954 and named \"John Oxley\" in honour of an early Australian explorer and surveyor.\n\nVH-TVC was leased to Ansett-ANA on 7 March 1960 and operated with the passenger cabin configured for 48 passengers.\n\nThe aircraft made 12,010 flights and flew for 16,946 hours.\n\n\n"}

Specifically, the survey aimed to \"carry out a rapid assessment of the current state of coral reef systems and to make this scientific record publicly available for scientists worldwide to use\". The survey was sponsored by the Catlin Group until the survey ended when the Catlin group ended sponsorship. The original team created a film, chasing coral and a new, global initiative known as 50 reefs.\n\nThe survey started in September 2012, and was focused on sections of the Great Barrier Reef across a range of depths. Specifically, 32 reefs were sampled, which equated to approximately of reef. This produced around 105,000 images, which are currently being analysed by scientists globally, using image recognition software. In addition to imaging shallow reefs, the deeper reef was sampled. This also led to the discovery of the deepest known coral reef in the Great Barrier Reef, which is located at a depth of .\n\nThis initial success led to the continuation of the survey globally. In 2013, the survey focussed on sampling corals in the Caribbean sea and Bermuda. Other sites are also being explored in 2014.\n\nThe status of surveyed reefs is being documented using high-resolution, 360-degree panoramic vision. These images are GPS-tagged with camera direction recorded, documenting precise locations. This method of documentation is intended to form a visual record of the world's reefs, allowing different reefs to be visually compared, and individual reefs to be monitored over time. This imaging also aims to help both the general public and specific groups (e.g. policy makers) better identify and understand the threats facing coral reefs. Likewise, these images are intended to assist the formation of strategies to protect reefs.\n\nTo survey deeper reefs, specialist divers and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROUVs) are being utilised. The temperatures of these deep reefs are also being monitored. In addition, biological samples are being collected to identify potential genetic links between shallow and deep coral systems, which could be important for conservation. Pulsed Amplitude Modulated (PAM) stress detection devices are also being used in deeper reefs to monitor stress levels.\n\nMuch of this imaging was produced using the SVII Camera. The SVII is a self-propelling underwater panoramic camera, and was designed by the survey team. The camera can be controlled by a diver, and is propelled at a constant speed. The Seaview SVII-S has also been designed, and is a lighter, human-propelled version of the SVII which can be transported by a single person. Underwater tablets are used to control the cameras and observe real-time images, and have also been used for communication, especially with social media. \n\nAs mentioned, ROUVs are used to sample deeper reefs. These are highly mobile, and can operate at low depths. These ROUVs also contain scientific equipment which can be altered depending on the sampling being carried out, and can carry out sampling. As with the low-depth cameras, these ROUVs are able to produce high definition geo-positioned images.\n\nData from the Catlin Seaview Survey has been used to construct the Catlin Global Reef Record, which was launched in 2013. This database contains images and data collected by the Catlin Seaview Survey and by other coral reef research. However, the huge photographic records generated by the Catlin Seaview Survey are the main aspect of this record. The Catlin Global Reef Record is freely available to scientists globally, and can be used to analyse these reef environments and monitor their change.\n\n"}

{"id": "38945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38945", "title": "Cooking banana", "text": "Cooking banana\n\nCooking bananas are banana cultivars in the genus \"Musa\" whose fruits are generally used in cooking. They may be eaten ripe or unripe and are generally starchy. Many cooking bananas are referred to as plantains ( , ) or green bananas, although not all of them are true plantains. Bananas are treated as a starchy fruit with a relatively neutral flavour and soft texture when cooked. Bananas fruit all year round, making them a reliable all-season staple food.\n\nCooking bananas are a major food staple in West and Central Africa, the Caribbean islands, Central America, and northern, coastal parts of South America. Members of the genus \"Musa\" are indigenous to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and Oceania, including the Malay Archipelago (modern Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines) and Northern Australia. Africa is considered a second centre of diversity for \"Musa\" cultivars: West Africa for some plantains and the central highlands for East African Highland bananas (\"Musa\" AAA-EAHB; known as \"matoke\" in Uganda), most of which are cooked, although some are primarily used to make beer. \n\nThe term \"plantain\" is loosely applied to any banana cultivar that is usually cooked before it is eaten. However, there is no botanical distinction between bananas and plantains. Cooking is also a matter of custom, rather than necessity, for many bananas. In fact, ripe plantains can be eaten raw since their starches are converted to sugars. In some countries, where only a few cultivars of banana are consumed, there may be a clear distinction between plantains and bananas. In other countries, where many cultivars are consumed, there is no distinction in the common names used.\n\nIn botanical usage, the term \"plantain\" is used only for true plantains, while other starchy cultivars used for cooking are called \"cooking bananas\". All modern true plantains have three sets of chromosomes (i.e. they are triploid). Many are hybrids derived from the cross of two wild species, \"Musa acuminata\" and \"Musa balbisiana\". The currently accepted scientific name for all such crosses is \"Musa\" × \"paradisiaca\". Using Simmonds and Shepherds' 1955 genome-based nomenclature system, cultivars which are cooked often belong to the AAB Group, although some (e.g. the East African Highland bananas) belong to the AAA Group, and others (e.g. Saba bananas) belong to the ABB Group.\n\nFe'i bananas (\"Musa\" × \"troglodytarum\") from the Pacific Islands are often eaten roasted or boiled, and thus informally referred to as \"mountain plantains.\" However, they do not belong to either of the two species that all modern banana cultivars are descended from.\n\nPlantains contain more starch and less sugar than dessert bananas, therefore they are usually cooked or otherwise processed before being eaten. They are always cooked or fried when eaten green. At this stage, the pulp is hard and the peel often so stiff that it has to be cut with a knife to be removed.\n\nMature, yellow plantains can be peeled like typical dessert bananas; the pulp is softer than in immature, green fruit and some of the starch has been converted to sugar. They can be eaten raw, but are not as flavourful as dessert bananas, so are usually cooked. When mature, yellow plantains are fried, they tend to caramelize, turning a golden-brown color. They can also be boiled, baked, microwaved or grilled over charcoal, either peeled or unpeeled.\n\nPlantains are a staple food in the tropical regions of the world, ranking as the tenth most important staple food in the world. As a staple, plantains are treated in much the same way as potatoes and with a similar neutral flavour and texture when the unripe fruit is cooked by steaming, boiling or frying.\n\nSince they fruit all year round, plantains are a reliable all-season staple food, particularly in developing countries with inadequate food storage, preservation and transportation technologies. In Africa, plantains and bananas provide more than 25 percent of the carbohydrate requirements for over 70 million people. \"Musa\" spp. do not stand high winds well, however, so plantain plantations are liable to destruction by hurricanes.\n\nAn average plantain has about 220 calories and is a good source of potassium and dietary fiber. The sap from the fruit peel, as well as the entire plant, can stain clothing and hands, and can be very difficult to remove.\n\nLinnaeus originally classified bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: \"Musa paradisiaca\" for plantains and \"Musa sapientum\" for dessert bananas. Both are now known to be hybrids between the species \"Musa acuminata\" (A genome) and \"Musa balbisiana\" (B genome). The earlier published name, \"Musa\" × \"paradisiaca\", is now used as the scientific name for all such hybrids. Most modern plantains are sterile triploids belonging to the AAB Group, sometimes known as the \"Plantain group\". Other economically important cooking banana groups include the East African Highland bananas (Mutika/Lujugira subgroup) of the AAA Group and the Pacific plantains (including the Popoulo, Maoli, and Iholena subgroups), also of the AAB Group.\n\nIn countries in Central America and the Caribbean, the plantain is either simply fried, boiled or made into plantain soup.\n\nIn Ghana of West Africa, boiled plantain is eaten with \"kontomire\" stew, cabbage stew or \"fante-fante\" (fish) stew. The boiled plantain can be mixed with groundnut paste, pepper, onion and palm oil to make \"eto\", which is eaten with avocado. Ripe plantains can also be fried and eaten with black eyed beans cooked in palm oil – a popular breakfast dish. Kelewele, a Ghanaian snack, is spiced ripe plantain deep fried in palm oil or vegetable oil. In Nigeria, plantain is eaten boiled, fried or roasted; \"boli\" – roasted plantain – is usually eaten with palm oil or groundnut. \n\nIn Guatemala, ripe plantains are eaten boiled, fried, or in a special combination where they are boiled, mashed and then stuffed with sweetened black beans. Afterwards, they are deep fried in sunflower or corn oil. The dish is called \"rellenitos de plátano\" and is served as a dessert. In Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba, it can also be mashed after it has been fried and be made a \"mofongo\", or fried and made into \"tostones, tajadas\", or \"platanutres,\" or it can be boiled or stuffed. \"Tostones\", also known as \"patacones\" are a popular staple in many South American countries.\n\nPlantains can be used for cooking at any stage of ripeness, but ripe ones can be eaten raw. As the plantain ripens, it becomes sweeter and its colour changes from green to yellow to black, just like bananas. Green plantains are firm and starchy, and resemble potatoes in flavour. Yellow plantains are softer and starchy yet sweet. Extremely ripe plantains have softer, deep yellow pulp that is much sweeter.\n\nPlantains in the yellow to black stages of ripeness can be used in sweet dishes. Steam-cooked plantains are considered a nutritious food for infants and the elderly. A ripe plantain is used as food for infants at weaning, mashed with a pinch of salt.\n\nPlantains are also dried and ground into flour; \"banana meal\" forms an important foodstuff. \n\nIn southern India, dried plantain powder is mixed with a little bit of fennel seed powder and boiled in milk or water to make baby food to feed babies until they are one year old.\n\nIn Peru, plantains are boiled and blended with water, spices, and sugar to make chapo. In Kerala, ripe plantains are boiled with sago, coconut milk, sugar and spices to make a pudding.\n\nAfter removing the skin, the unripe fruit can be sliced thin and deep fried in hot oil to produce chips. This thin preparation of plantain is known as \"tostones\", \"patacones\" or \"plataninas\" in some of Central American and South American countries, \"platanutres\" in Puerto Rico, \"mariquitas\" or \"chicharritas\" in Cuba and \"chifles\" in Ecuador and Peru. In Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, \"tostones\" instead refers to thicker twice-fried patties (see below). In Cuba, plantain chips are called \"mariquitas\". They are sliced thinly, and fried in oil until golden colored. They are popular appetizers served with a main dish. In Colombia they are known as \"platanitos\" and are eaten with suero atollabuey as a snack. \"Tostada\" refers to a green, unripe plantain which has been cut into sections, fried, flattened, fried again, and salted. These tostadas are often served as a side dish or a snack. They are also known as \"tostones\" or \"patacones\" in many Latin American countries. In Honduras, banana chips are called \"tajadas\", which may be sliced vertically to create a variation known as plantain strips.\n\nChips fried in coconut oil and sprinkled with salt, called \"upperi\" or \"kaya varuthathu\", are a snack in South India. They are an important item in sadya, a vegetarian feast prepared during festive occasions. The chips are typically labeled \"plantain chips\" when they are made of green plantains that taste starchy, like potato chips. In Tamil Nadu, a thin variety made from green plantains is used to make chips seasoned with salt, chili powder and asafoetida. In the western/central Indian language Marathi, the plantain is called \"rajeli kela\" (figuratively meaning \"king-sized\" banana), and is often used to make fried chips.\n\nCurries and soups using plantains are consumed throughout the world.\n\nAlcapurria is a type of savory Puerto Rican fritter. Although usually consisting mainly of grated green bananas and yautias, they can also contain plantains. The \"masa\" (dough) is used to encase a filling of ground meat (\"picadillo\"), and the \"alcapurrias\" are then deep-fried.\n\nPlantains are used in the Ivory Coast dish \"aloco\" as the main ingredient. Fried plantains are covered in an onion-tomato sauce, often with a grilled fish between the plantains and sauce.\n\n\"Little spiders\" in Spanish translation, a Puerto Rican pattie fritter made from shredded unripe and ripe plantains mixed sometimes with herbs, spices and eggs.\n\nSri Lanka's ash plantains called \"alu kesel\" are generally used for cooking. On some occasions, they are used in Ayurvedic medicine. Plantain flower also called as kesel mala (or kehelmala or kesel muwa). Plantain flower (or kehelmala or kesel muwa) is also used to make curries to be eaten with rice.\n\nIn the Philippines, Banana cue is a popular snack. 'Banana cue' may be a misnomer as it is not cooked in a skewer over hot embers like a barbecue. Rather, the peeled flesh of an under-ripe plantain is fried in hot oil over medium fire before it is held in a skewer ready for sale. There are two ways to prepare a banana cue. One way is to fry the peeled banana in oil with some amount of brown sugar thrown in to caramelize the flesh. Another way is to fry the flesh in oil until done. When done, they are scooped out of the cooking pan and placed on a dripping pan to allow the oil to drip, before a generous amount of refined sugar is sprinkled over them. A variant from Mindanao, known as \"Ginanggang\", is different in that it is actually grilled over charcoal.\n\nPhilippine plantains (called Saba or Cardaba Bananas) are much smaller than the Latin American varieties, usually around 4–5 inches and somewhat boxy in shape. They are eaten mostly in their ripe stage as a dessert or sweet snack, often simply boiled, in syrup, or sliced lengthwise and fried, then sprinkled with sugar. They are also quite popular in this fried form (without the sugar) in the local version of the Spanish dish, \"Arroz a la Cubana\", consisting of minced picadillo-style seasoned beef, white rice, and fried eggs, with fried plantains on the side. In addition, there is the equally popular \"merienda\" snack, \"Turrón\", where ripe plantains, as well as jackfruit in some variants, are sliced and then wrapped in lumpia wrapper (a thin rice paper) and deep-fried. Turron is then finished off with a brown sugar glaze.\n\nThe traditional South American style large plantains (grown in the Southern Philippines) are now increasingly available in local Filipino markets.\n\n\"Boli\" is the term used for roasted plantain in Nigeria. The plantain is usually grilled and served with roasted fish, ground peanuts and a hot palm oil sauce. It is very popular as a lunch snack in southern and western Nigeria, for example in Rivers State, Bayelsa State, Cross River State, Delta State, Edo State and Lagos State. It is popular among the working class as a quick midday meal.\n\nPlantain dumplings from Puerto Rico are grated and mixed with cornstarch, egg, seasoning, parsley, and annatto oil. They are then formed into a ball about the size of a golf ball. The balls are first deep fried and then dropped into a hot broth usually a soup with pigeon peas and ham called asopao.\n\nCayeye, also called Mote de Guineo, is a traditional Colombian dish from the Caribbean Coast of the country. Cayeye is made by cooking small green bananas or plantains in water, then mashing and mixing them with refrito, made with onions, garlic, red bell pepper, tomato and achiote.\n\nCayeye are usually served for breakfast with fresh grated Colombian cheese (Queso Costeño) and fried fish, shrimp, crab, or beef. Most popular is Cayeye with fresh cheese, avocado and fried egg on top.\n\n\"Chifles\" is the Spanish term used in Peru and Ecuador for fried green plantains sliced (1 or 2 mm thick); it is also used to describe plantain chips which are sliced thinner.\n\nPlantain is popular in West Africa, especially Cameroon, Bénin, Ghana and Nigeria; when ripe plantain is fried, it is generally called \"dodo\" (dough – dough). The ripe plantain is usually sliced diagonally for a large oval shape, then fried in oil to a golden brown color. This can be eaten as such, with stew or served with beans or on rice.\n\nIn Ikire, a town in Western Nigeria precisely Osun State, there is a special and unique way of preparing plantain chips. This is popularly called Dodo Ikire. Dodo Ikire is made from overripe plantain, chopped in small pieces, sprinkled with chili pepper and fried in boiling point palm oil. After frying it turns blackish. The fried plantain chips are then stuffed carefully into a special conically shaped woven basket of about 10 centimeters high. This special dodo can have a preservative quality that lasts up to two months without refrigeration.\n\n\"Ethakka appam\", \"pazham\" (banana) \"boli\" or \"pazham pori\" are terms used for fried plantain in Kerala. The plantain is usually dipped in sweetened rice and white flour batter and then fried in coconut or vegetable oil. It is a very popular snack among Keralites. This is very similar to pisang goreng (Indonesian for fried bananas), which is a dessert common to Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. It is also known as Bajji in Tamil Nadu.\n\nEto a popular Ghanaian traditional dish. It is mainly made from boiled and mashed yam or plaintain. For the plaintain option called ‘Boodie eto’, the plantain can be used unripe, slightly ripe or fully ripe.\n\nCulturally, it was the food fed to a bride on the day of her marriage and its best savored with a whole egg, groundnut (peanuts) and sliced avocado.\n\n\"Fufu de platano\" is a traditional and very popular lunch dish in Cuba, and essentially akin to the Puerto Rican mofongo. It is a \"fufu\" made by boiling the plantains in water and mashing with a fork. The \"fufu\" is then mixed with chicken stock and \"sofrito\", a sauce made from lard, garlic, onions, pepper, tomato sauce, a touch of vinegar and cumin. The texture of Cuban \"fufu\" is similar to the \"mofongo\" consumed in Puerto Rico, but it is not formed into a ball. \"Fufu\" is also a common centuries-old traditional dish made in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon and other West & Central African countries. It is made in a similar fashion as the Cuban \"fufu\", but is pounded, and has a thick paste, putty-like texture which is then formed into a ball. West African \"fufu\" is sometimes separately made with cassava, yams or made with plantains combined with cassava.\n\nIn Ecuador, plantain is boiled, crushed, scrambled, and fried into \"majado\". This dish is typically served with a cup of coffee and bistek, fish, or grated cheese. It is a popular breakfast dish. Majado is also used as a base to prepare tigrillo and \"bolones\". To prepare trigrillo, majado is scrambled with pork rind, egg, cheese, green onions, parsley, and cilantro. To prepare bolones, majado is scrambled with cheese, pork rind, or a mixture of both. The resulting mixture is then shaped into a sphere which is later deep-fried. Both tigrillo and bolones are typically served with a cup of coffee.\n\nA traditional mangú from the Dominican Republic consists of peeled green, boiled plantains, mashed with enough hot water they were boiled in so the consistency is a little stiffer than mashed potatoes. It is traditionally eaten for breakfast, topped with sautéed onions and accompanied by fried eggs, fried cheese, fried salami, or avocado.\n\n\"Matooke\", or \"matoke\", is a cooking banana dish of the Baganda, now widely prepared in Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and eastern Congo. The cooking bananas (specifically East African Highland bananas) are peeled, wrapped in the plant's leaves and set in a cooking pot (a \"sufuria\") on the stalks that have been removed from the leaves. The pot is then placed on a charcoal fire and the matoke is steamed for a few hours. While uncooked, the \"matoke\" is white and fairly hard, but cooking turns it soft and yellow. The \"matoke\" is then mashed while still wrapped in the leaves, and often is served on a fresh leaf and eaten with a sauce made of vegetables, ground peanuts, or some type of meat (goat meat and beef are common).\n\nOriginating from Puerto Rico, and essentially akin to the Cuban \"fufu\", \"mofongo\" is made by mashing fried plantains in a mortar with chicharrón or bacon, garlic, olive oil and stock. Any meat, fish, shellfish, vegetables, spices, or herbs can also be added. The resulting mixture is formed into cylinders the size of about two fists and eaten warm, usually with chicken broth. \n\n\"Mofongo relleno\" is topped with creole sauce rather than served with chicken broth. Creole sauce may contain stewed beef, chicken or seafood; it is poured into a center crater, formed with the serving spoon, in the \"mofongo\".\n\n\"Nagasari\" is a traditional steamed \"kue\" (Indonesian traditional cake) made from rice flour, coconut milk and sugar, filled with slices of banana. It is usually wrapped in banana leaves before being steamed, or prepared with pandan that gives it aroma. It is commonly eaten as a snack in Indonesia where it is also known as \"kue bandang-bandang\" by Bugis people. Sometimes it is simply called \"kue pisang\" (banana cake).\n\n\"Piñon\" is a traditional dish from Puerto Rico. The dish is similar to lasagna, but uses sweet plantains (amarillitos) to replace the pasta layers. A similar dish called \"pastelon\" is made with layers of mashed plantains.\n\nA popular Caribbean dish which originated in Puerto Rico is called \"piononos\", after Pope Pius IX, and is made of sweet plantain forming a ring stuffed with seasoned meat or seafood, with an egg-and-flour mixture covering both open sides of the ring and deep-fried.\n\n\"Pisang goreng \" (\"fried banana\" in Indonesian and Malay) is a plantain snack deep-fried in coconut oil. \"Pisang goreng\" can be coated in batter flour or fried without batter. It is a snack food mostly found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei.\n\nAfter removing the skin, the ripened fruit (\"maduro\") can be sliced (between 3 mm and 2 cm thick) and pan-fried in oil until golden brown or according to preference. In the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Colombia, Honduras (where they are usually eaten with the native sour cream) and Venezuela, they are also eaten baked in the oven (sometimes with cinnamon). In Puerto Rico baked \"plátanos maduros\" are usually eaten for breakfast and served with eggs (mainly an omelet with cheese), chorizo or bacon. Only salt is added to green plantains.\n\n\"Plátanos maduros\" are commonly eaten in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, El Salvador, Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Peru, Colombia, Cuba, Suriname, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and most of the English-speaking Caribbean (called plantain), Aruba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. In Costa Rica, they are sprinkled with sugar. In western Nigeria, fried, sliced plantains are known as \"dodo\", and in Cameroon, they are known as \"missole\". In Venezuela, the ripe fruit is cut lengthwise, 3–4 mm thick, and fried until golden and sticky to make \"tajadas\", a common side dish; they are an integral piece of the national dish, \"pabellon criollo\".\n\nIn Honduras, Venezuela and Central Colombia, fried ripened plantain slices are known as \"tajadas\". They are customary in most typical meals, such as the Venezuelan \"pabellón criollo\". The host or waiter may also offer them as \"barandas\" (guard rails), in common slang, as the long slices are typically placed on the sides of a full dish, and therefore look as such. Some variations include adding honey or sugar and frying the slices in butter, to obtain a golden caramel; the result has a sweeter taste and a characteristic pleasant smell. The same slices are known as \"amarillos\" and \"fritos maduros\" in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic respectively.\n\nIn Honduras, they are a popular takeaway food, usually with fried chicken, though they are also regularly eaten at home. They are popular chips sold in \"pulperias\" (minimarkets). In Panama, \"tajadas\" are eaten daily together with steamed rice, meat and beans, thus making up an essential part of the Panamanian diet, as with Honduras.\n\nBy contrast, in Nicaragua, \"tajadas\" are fried unripened plantain slices, and are traditionally served in a \"fritanga\" or with fried pork, or on their own on green banana leaves, either with a cabbage salad or fresh cheese.\n\nOn Colombia's Caribbean coast, \"tajadas\" of fried green plantain are consumed along with grilled meats, and are the dietary equivalent of the French-fried potatoes/chips of Europe and North America.\n\n\"Tostones\" (also known as \"banann peze\" in Haiti, \"tachinos\" or \"chatinos\" in Cuba, \"platanos verdes fritos\" or \"fritos verdes\" in the Dominican Republic and \"patacones\" in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Peru and Venezuela) are twice-fried plantain patties, often served as a side dish, appetizer, or snack. Plantains are sliced in long pieces and fried in oil. The segments are then removed and individually smashed down either with the bottom of a bottle or with a \"tostonera\", to about half their original height. Finally, the pieces are fried again and then seasoned, often with salt. In some countries, such as Haiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, the \"tostones\" are dipped in creole sauce from chicken, pork, beef, or shrimp before eating. In Nicaragua, tostones are typically served with fried cheese (Tostones con queso) and sometimes with refried beans. In some South American countries, the name \"tostones\" is used to describe this food when prepared at home and also plantain chips (mentioned above), which are typically purchased from a store. \n\nIn western Venezuela, much of Colombia and the Peruvian Amazon, \"patacones\" are a frequently seen variation of \"tostones\". Plantains are sliced in long pieces and fried in oil, then used to make sandwiches with pork, beef, chicken, vegetables and ketchup. They can be made with unripe \"patacon verde\" or ripe \"patacon amarillo\" plantains. \"Tostones\" in the Dominican Republic are only fried once and are thicker than chips. Although there are local names for \"tostones\" in almost every Latin country, they are still commonly called \"tostones\" in all of Latin America.\n\nTacacho is a roasted plantain Amazonian cuisine dish from Peru. It is usually served \"con cecina\", with bits of pork.\n\nIn Venezuela, a yo-yo is a traditional dish made of two short slices of fried ripened plantain (see Tajadas) placed on top of each other, with local soft white cheese in the middle (in a sandwich-like fashion) and held together with toothpicks. The arrangement is dipped in beaten eggs and fried again until the cheese melts and the yo-yo acquires a deep golden hue. They are served as sides or entrees.\n\nEach pseudostem of a plantain plant will flower only once, and all the flowers grow at the end of its shoot in a large bunch consisting of multiple hands with individual fingers (the fruits). Only the first few hands will become fruits.\n\nIn the Philippines, the plantain inflorescence (particularly those from saba bananas), locally known as \"puso ng saging\" (banana hearts) are eaten. In Vietnam, the young male flower, at the end of the bunch, is used in salads. In the cuisine of Laos, the plantain flower is typically eaten raw in vermicelli soups. A type of poriyal, or peretal (dry curry), is made from plantain flowers in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Thoran is made in Kerala with the end of the bunch (called \"koompu\" in Malayalam) and is considered highly nutritious. In Karnataka, the inflorescence is used to make sweet and sour \"gojju\", a gravy dish.\n\nPlantain leaves can exceed two meters in length. They are similar to banana leaves, but are larger and stronger, thus reducing waste in cooking. In Latin America, plantain leaves are lightly smoked over an open fire, which makes them more flexible, and improves storage properties, flavor and aroma. In Venezuela, they are available in grocery stores or open-air markets and are used as wrappers in \"hallacas\". In Nicaragua, they wrap \"nacatamales\", as well as \"vigoron\", \"vaho\" and other dishes. In Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia, plantain leaves are usually used to wrap \"tamales\" before and while cooking, and they can be used to wrap any kind of seasoned meat while cooking to keep the flavor in. Puerto Rican \"pasteles\" are made primarily with fresh green banana dough stuffed with pork, and then wrapped in plantain leaves which have been softened by smoking. Many rice dishes in Puerto Rico are cooked with plantain leaves as a lid to add flavor and aroma. In Puerto Rico fish and pork shoulder can be wrapped in plantain leaves and baked. \"Guanimes\", known as Puerto Rican tamales, which are made of cornmeal cooked with coconut milk and other ingredients, are wrapped in plantain leaves. Similarly, in Africa, plantain leaves are dried and used to wrap corn dough before it is boiled to make \"fanti kenkey\", a Ghanaian dish eaten with ground pepper, onions, tomatoes and fish. In Nigeria, ground beans mixed with onions, fish and boiled egg is wrapped in plantain leaves and boiled to make bean cakes called \"moin-moin\" or \"moi-moi\".\n\nTraditionally, plantain leaves are used like plates while serving South Indian thali or during sadya. A traditional southern Indian meal is served on a plantain leaf with the positions of the different kinds of food items on the leaf having significance. The leaves also have a religious significance in many Hindu rituals. They add a subtle, but essential, aroma to cooked dishes. In the Indian state of Kerala, a food preparation called \"ada\" is made in plantain leaves. Plantain leaves are also used in making \"karimeen pollichathu\" in Kerala. In the South Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, plantain leaves are used to serve food during festivals or special occasions. People use the leaves like cooking foil for steaming \"idlis\" (steamed rice cakes) and \"kozhukkatais\" (steamed rice dumplings). The leaves are also widely used as a packaging material for packing food and flowers, although plastics are beginning to replace the leaves for this purpose. The leaves are similarly used to wrap certain kinds of food in the Philippines as well.\n\nAfter harvesting the fruit, the plantain plant can be cut and the layers peeled like an onion to get a cylinder-shaped soft shoot. In the South Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, plantain shoot is chopped into fine pieces and used in salads, dry curry (often seasoned with coconut and green chillies), or wet curry (with yogurt, red chillies and coconut). Plantain shoot is considered rich in fibre, and is considered a very good remedy for avoiding constipation. Regular intake of the juice squeezed from the shoot or of the shoot consumed as a salad is locally considered a cure for various ailments such as stomach ulcers and kidney stones.\nThis can be chopped and first steamed, then fried with masala powder, to make a special dish. This dish is called \"posola\" in Assamese and a distinct part of Assamese cuisine. In Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, a thoran is made from the shoot for auspicious occasions like marriages.\nThe peeled layers are used by farmers as a binding rope for packaging agricultural produce, such as flowers, betel leaves, etc. The dried stem peels are slit into fine threads and are used for weaving mats, stringing garlands and wrapping packages. Juice from the stem and the peel have also been used traditionally in first aid for burns and minor abrasions.\n\nVazhaithandu is a Tamil word for the stem and it is used in various soups, stews, stir-fries, and koottus.\n\nPlantain is 32% carbohydrates with 2% dietary fiber and 15% sugars, 1% protein, 0.4% fat, and 65% water, supplying 122 calories in a 100-gram serving (table). Raw plantain is an excellent source (20% or higher of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin B6 (23% DV) and vitamin C (22% DV), and a good source (10-19% DV) of magnesium and potassium (table).\n\nContaining little beta-carotene (457 micrograms per 100 grams), plantain is not a good source of vitamin A (table).\n\nThe following table shows the nutrient content of raw plantain and major staple foods.\n\nPlantain and banana allergies occur with typical characteristics of food allergy or latex fruit syndrome, including itching and mild swelling of the lips, tongue, palate or throat, skin rash, stomach complaints or anaphylactic shock. Among more than 1000 proteins identified in \"Musa\" species were numerous previously described protein allergens.\n\n"}
{"id": "507776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=507776", "title": "Cotton candy", "text": "Cotton candy\n\nCotton candy (also known as fairy floss in Australia and candy floss in the Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, India and Sri Lanka) is a form of spun sugar. The confection is mostly sugar, with small amounts of either flavoring or food coloring often being added.\n\nCotton candy is made by heating and liquefying sugar and spinning it out through minute holes. It resolidifies in minutely thin strands of \"sugar glass\".. The final cotton candy contains mostly air, with a typical serving weighing around 1 ounce or 28 grams. It is often served at fairs, circuses, carnivals, and Japanese festivals, and sold on a stick or in a plastic bag. \n\nSimilar light halva confections include the Indian\" sohan papdi\" and \"pootharekulu\", the Persian \"pashmak\", and the Turkish \"pişmaniye\", although the latter is made with flour and water in addition to sugar. Tatar cuisine has similar flour-honey sweet sawdust \"talqysh-kalava\". Similar sweets include Chinese dragon's-beard candy and Korean honey skein \"kkul-tarae\".\n\nSeveral places claim the origin of cotton candy, with some sources tracing it to a form of spun sugar found in Europe in the 19th century. At that time, spun sugar was an expensive, labor-intensive endeavor and was not generally available to the average person. Others suggest versions of spun sugar originated in Italy as early as the 15th century.\n\nMachine-spun cotton candy was invented in 1897 by the dentist William Morrison and confectioner John C. Wharton, and first introduced to a wide audience at the 1904 World's Fair as \"Fairy Floss\" with great success, selling 68,655 boxes at 25¢ per box (equivalent to $6 per box today). Joseph Lascaux, a dentist from New Orleans, Louisiana, invented a similar cotton candy machine in 1921. In fact, the Lascaux patent named the sweet confection “cotton candy” and the \"fairy floss\" name faded away, although it retains this name in Australia. In the 1970s, an automatic cotton candy machine was created which made the product and packaged it. This made it easier to produce and available to sell at carnivals, fairs, and stores in the 1970s and on.\n\nTootsie Roll of Canada Ltd., the world's largest cotton-candy manufacturer, makes a bagged, fruit-flavored version called Fluffy Stuff.\n\nThe United States declared National Cotton Candy Day to be on December 7.\n\nTypical machines used to make cotton candy include a spinning head enclosing a small \"sugar reserve\" bowl into which a charge of granulated, colored sugar (or separate sugar and food coloring) is poured. Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by centrifugal force. Colored sugar packaged specially for the process is milled with melting characteristics and a crystal size optimized for the head and heated holes; granulated sugar used in baking contains fine crystals which spin out unmelted, while rock sugar crystals are too large to properly contact the heater, slowing the production of cotton candy.\n\nThe molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught in a larger bowl which totally surrounds the spinning head. Left to operate for a period, the cotton-like product builds up on the inside walls of the larger bowl, at which point machine operators twirl a stick or cone around the rim of the large catching bowl, gathering the sugar strands into portions which are served on stick or cone, or in plastic bags. As the sugar reserve bowl empties, the operator recharges it with more feedstock. The product is sensitive to humidity, and in humid summer locales, the process can be messy and sticky.\n\nModern innovations in cotton-candy equipment include vending machines which automatically produce single servings of the product, developed in Taiwan, and lighted or glowing sticks.\n\nThe source material for candy mesh is usually both colored and flavored. When spun, cotton candy is first white because it is made from sugar, but adding dye or coloring can transform the color. Originally, cotton candy was just white. In the US, so-called 'floss sugar' is available in a wide variety of flavors, but two flavor-blend colors predominate – 'blue raspberry' and 'pink vanilla', both originally formulated by the Gold Medal brand (which uses the names 'Boo Blue' and 'Silly Nilly'). Cotton candy also comes out purple, when mixed, making a significant favorite at fairs. Cotton candy machines were notoriously unreliable until Gold Medal's invention of a sprung base in 1949, and since then, they have manufactured nearly all commercial cotton-candy machines and much of the floss sugar in the US.\n\nTypically, once spun, cotton candy is only marketed by color. Absent a clear name other than 'blue', the distinctive taste of the blue raspberry flavor mix has gone on to become a compound flavor that some other foods (gum, ice cream, rock candy, fluoride toothpaste) occasionally borrow (\"cotton-candy flavored ice cream\") to invoke the nostalgia of cotton candy that people typically only get to experience on vacation or holidays. Pink bubble gum went through a similar transition from specific branded product to a generic flavor that transcended the original confection, and 'bubble gum flavor' often shows up in the same product categories as 'cotton candy flavor'.\n\nIn 1978, the first automated machine was used for the production of cotton candy. Since then, the creations and innovations of this machine have become greater and greater. They range in sizes from counter-top accessible to party and carnival size. Modern machines that are made for commercial use can hold up to of sugar and have compartments for storage of extra flavors. The rotating bowl at the top spins at 3,450 revolutions per minute.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "519887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519887", "title": "Fiber crop", "text": "Fiber crop\n\nFiber crops are field crops grown for their fibers, which are traditionally used to make paper, cloth, or rope. They are organized into 3 main groups—textile fibers (used in production of cloth), cordage fibers (used in production of rope), and filling fibers (used to stuff upholstery and mattresses). They are a type of natural fiber.\n\nFiber crops are characterized by having a large concentration of cellulose, which is what gives them their strength. The fibers may be chemically modified, like in viscose (used to make rayon and cellophane). In recent years, materials scientists have begun exploring further use of these fibers in composite materials. Due to cellulose being the main factor of a plant fibers strength, this is what scientists are looking to manipulate to create different types of fibers.\n\nFiber crops are generally harvestable after a single growing season, as distinct from trees, which are typically grown for many years before being harvested for such materials as wood pulp fiber or lacebark. In specific circumstances, fiber crops can be superior to wood pulp fiber in terms of technical performance, environmental impact or cost.\n\nThere are a number of issues regarding the use of fiber crops to make pulp. One of these is seasonal availability. While trees can be harvested continuously, many field crops are harvested once during the year and must be stored such that the crop doesn't rot over a period of many months. Considering that many pulp mills require several thousand tonnes of fiber source per day, storage of the fiber source can be a major issue.These fiber mostly found in leaf ,seeds or in the body of a tree.Fiber crops are more important in daily life basis.\n\nBotanically, the fibers harvested from many of these plants are bast fibers; the fibers come from the phloem tissue of the plant. The other fiber crop fibers are hard/leaf fibers (come from the entirety of plant vascular bundles) and surface fibers (come from plant epidermal tissue).\n\nBefore the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fiber source was recycled fibers from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from hemp, linen and cotton. A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774. Today this method is called deinking. It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from ragpickers.\n\nTo have a source of fiber to utilize in production, the fiber first must be extracted from the plant. This is done in different ways depending on the fiber classification. Bast fibers are harvested through retting which is where microbes are utilized to remove soft tissues from the plant and only the useful fibrous material remains. Hard fibers are harvested mainly through decortication which is where the non-fibrous tissues are removed by hand or machine. Lastly, surface fibers are harvested through ginning which is where a machine removes the fibers from other plant material.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "540317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=540317", "title": "Ford Explorer", "text": "Ford Explorer\n\nThe Ford Explorer is a range of SUVs manufactured by Ford Motor Company. Introduced in 1990 for the 1991 model year, it is currently in its fifth generation. Variants have also been marketed through the Lincoln-Mercury Division as the Mercury Mountaineer (1997-2010) and Lincoln Aviator (2003-2005). As with the Ford Ranger, it derives its name from a trim package used on the Ford F-Series (from 1968 to 1986). Alongside it, Ford also markets the Ford Police Interceptor Utility, a replacement for the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. A specially modified \"Special Service Vehicle\" version is also available from Ford Fleet for law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and EMS agencies. \n\nIntended as the replacement for the Ford Bronco II, the Ford Explorer was introduced in both two-door (the Ford Explorer Sport, also sold as the 1991-1994 Mazda Navajo) and four-door body styles, with the latter being the first four-door Ford SUV. Following the 2002 introduction of the third-generation Explorer, the Ford Explorer Sport was discontinued after the 2003 model year. The Ford Explorer Sport Trac is a mid-size pickup truck based upon two generations of the four-door style from 2001 to 2010. It was sold with several powertrain configurations. Along with two-wheel drive (rear-wheel drive 1991-2010; front-wheel drive 2011-present), part-time four-wheel drive, and all-wheel drive are options. Since 1995, part-time four-wheel drive has been a 'shift on the fly' system with full protection against being engaged at high speed. \n\nAs with its Ford Bronco II predecessor, the initial versions of the Ford Explorer derived its chassis and powertrain from the Ford Ranger, sharing a common chassis through 2001 for the four-door (the Explorer Sport was shared this commonality through its 2003 discontinuation and the Explorer Sport Trac would do so through 2005). For the 2002 launch of the third-generation Explorer, the model was given a body-on-frame chassis distinct from the Ranger. For the fifth-generation 2011 Explorer, the model range was shifted to unibody construction and into the full-size segment. Though sharing a similar chassis as the Ford Flex and Ford Taurus, Ford officially markets the current Ford Explorer as an SUV, slotted between the unibody-chassis Ford Escape and body-on-frame Ford Expedition.\n\nThe Ford Explorer was introduced in March 1990 for the 1991 model year. To better compete against the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and Jeep Cherokee mid-size sport-utility vehicles, Ford sought to replace the Ford Bronco II with a vehicle sized closer to its competitors. In an effort to attract family buyers, a four-door version was developed alongside the two-door (launched the same month as the four-door S-10 Blazer).\n\nAs with the Ford Bronco II, the first-generation Ford Explorer shares its chassis and underpinnings with the first-generation (1983-1992) Ford Ranger. In comparison to the Bronco II, the Explorer is far larger, with the two-door Explorer Sport gaining 12.6 inches in length and 2.1 inches of width; a four-door is 22.5 inches longer and 730 pounds heavier.\n\nAs with its predecessor, the Ford Explorer has a large degree of commonality with the Ford Ranger, sharing its front bumper, fenders (modified), headlights, grille, and wheels; with the exception of its steering wheel hub, the Explorer shares its entire dashboard with the 1989-1992 Ford Ranger. In a major change from the Bronco II, the Explorer was given its own front door stampings. In addition for creating a four-door layout, the lack of commonality with the Ranger allowed for two major aerodynamic improvements; along with the elimination of exterior drip rails (by wrapping the doors into the roof), the sideview mirrors were integrated onto the doors (rather than bolted on). \n\nSharing its engine with the Ranger and four-wheel drive Ford Aerostar, the Explorer was fitted with a German-produced 155hp 4.0L \"Cologne\" V6 as the sole engine offering, replacing the previous 2.9L V6. A Mazda M5OD 5-speed manual was the standard transmission offering, with the option of the Ford 4-speed A4LD overdrive automatic transmission. For 1993, the engine output was increased to 160hp.\n\nAlong with the standard rear-wheel drive powertrain, at its launch, the Explorer was also offered with various configurations of part-time four-wheel drive, powered by a Borg Warner 13–54 transfer case. In addition to a manually shifted transfer case, Ford offered \"Touch Drive\" electronic push-button shifting; both were \"shift-on-the-fly\" designs that allowed the vehicle to be shifted from two-wheel drive to \"four-high\" at any speed and into \"four-low\" when the vehicle was stopped. All Explorers were equipped with the Ford 8.8 axle in either a limited slip differential, or open version with a variety of available gear ratios. Four-wheel-drive front axles were the TTB (\"Twin Traction Beam\") Dana 35 with some Dana 44-spec components.\n\nAt its launch, the Ford Explorer followed the Aerostar, Bronco, Econoline, F-Series, and Ranger in model trim. The XL was sold as the base trim, with XLT as the upper range, with the outdoors-themed Eddie Bauer trim as the top trim. The XL was distinguished by a black grille (chrome optional) with steel wheels, while the XLT offered a chrome grille and alloy wheels; the Eddie Bauer offered alloy wheels and two-tone paintwork. \n\nThe Ford Explorer Sport was offered solely on the two-door body style. Offering black lower bodywork and grille and alloy wheels, the Sport was intended as a replacement for the Bronco II. From 1991 to 1994, Mazda marketed the two-door Ford Explorer as the Mazda Navajo; the model was awarded the 1991 Motor Trend Truck of the Year award.\n\nThe Ford Explorer Limited was introduced for 1993 as a luxury-trim model slotted above the Eddie Bauer. Largely introduced as a competitor to the Oldsmobile Bravada, the Explorer Limited was offered only as a four-door with an automatic transmission. Distinguished by its color-matched grille, headlight trim, and model-specific bodywork and wheels, the Limited was offered with several model-specific features, including automatic headlights, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, foglamps, and center roof console (with compass and outside thermometer). \n\nThe Limited edition, added for the 1993 model year, was available only in the 5-door body style and was positioned at the top of the lineup above the Eddie Bauer edition. It featured automatic headlights, an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, foglamps, a center roof console with compass and outside thermometer, unique wheels and grille, and an automatic transmission as standard equipment. The grill and headlight trims on the Limited edition were paint-matched to the body color, unlike the chrome (XLT) or black plastic (XL) versions on other trim levels.\n\nThe second-generation Ford Explorer made its debut in late 1994 as a 1995 model. Retaining the same footprint as its predecessor, the 1995 Ford Explorer underwent extensive modifications to its chassis to improve its road manners. In an effort to better differentiate the model line from the Ford Ranger, Ford stylists redesigned the vehicle, giving the Explorer a model-specific exterior. As with its predecessor, the second generation was sold in both three-door and five-door configurations. Rear-wheel drive was standard, with four-wheel drive offered as an option. \n\nFollowing the 2002 introduction of the third-generation five-door Ford Explorer, the three-door Explorer became a stand-alone model on the second-generation design; the Explorer Sport was produced through the 2003 model year. \n\nThis generation of the Ford Explorer marks the debut of the Mercury Mountaineer, introduced by Mercury for 1997. In 2001, the Ford Explorer Sport Trac was introduced, which was a mid-size pickup truck; offered with a crew cab with a short pickup bed, the Sport Trac was based on the five-door Explorer. The Explorer Sport Trac was produced through the 2005 model year (until it was redesigned for 2007). \n\nOutside of North America, this generation of the Explorer was marketed in right-hand drive configurations As of 2018, RHD countries (such as Japan) export used examples of the Explorer to other countries (such as Australia and New Zealand) where there is demand for right-hand drive SUVs. Due to Japan's strict Shaken Laws, used vehicles tend to have low mileage with detailed repair histories. In the United States, the second-generation Ford Explorer has the (dubious) distinction of being two of the top five vehicles traded in under the 2009 \"Cash for Clunkers\" program, with the 4WD model topping the list and the 2WD model coming in at number 4. \n\nThe second-generation Ford Explorer is based upon the Ford U1 platform shared with its predecessor, adopting the UN105/UN150 model codes. Alongside similar changes in development for the 1998 Ford Ranger, the long-running Twin I-Beam/Twin Traction Beam front suspension was retired in favor of a short/long-arm (SLA) wishbone front suspension configuration. Along with more compact packaging of front suspension components, the design allowed for improved on-road handling/feel. \n\nThe optional engine of the Ford Ranger and Ford Aerostar, the 160 hp 4.0L V6 was carried over from the first-generation Ford Explorer. To match the V8 engine of the similar-sized Jeep Grand Cherokee, for the 1996 model year, Ford introduced a 5.0L V8 as an option. Initially available on rear-wheel drive XLT models, the availability of the 210 hp V8 was expanded to many versions of the five-door Explorer. For 1997, revised cylinder heads increased output of the 5.0L V8 to 215hp. Following the 1997 introduction of the 4.6L SOHC V8 by the Ford F-Series and E-Series, the Explorer became the final vehicle sold by Ford Motor Company sold with a gasoline-fuel pushrod V8. \n\nFor 1997, the Ford Explorer gained a third engine, as Ford introduced an overhead-cam version of the 4.0L Cologne V6. Using a common displacement with the pushrod 4.0L V6, the 210 hp SOHC V6 rivaled the V8 in engine output. Offered as standard equipment on the top-trim Eddie Bauer and Limited trims, the engine became an option on all other versions of the Explorer and Explorer Sport. For 2001, the pushrod V6 was discontinued, with the SOHC becoming the standard engine in all versions of the Explorer (and the sole engine of the 3-door Explorer Sport). \n\nIn 2000, Ford added flex-fuel capability to the Explorer for the first time.\n\nA Mazda-produced 5-speed manual was standard with both V6 engines; all V8 examples were equipped with a 4-speed heavy-duty automatic (shared with the F-150, Mustang, and Crown Victoria). On four-wheel drive versions, the four-wheel drive system was redesigned for the 1995 Explorer. In place of Touch Drive from the previous generation, ControlTrac was an electronically controlled full-time four-wheel drive system with a two-speed transfer case, with software controlling a multi-disc clutch (in place of a center differential). Along with traditional two-wheel drive and high and low-range four-wheel drive, \"Auto\" mode allowed software to maintain the amount of torque sent to the front wheels; if the front axle begins to spin faster, torque is shifted from the rear wheels to the front wheels until traction is achieved. Similar to TouchDrive, ControlTrac is dash-controlled, with a rotary selector for two-wheel drive(1995-1996), auto, high range, and low range.\n\nWhile visibly similar to its predecessor, many exterior panels from the 1995 Ford Explorer were changed, with only the roofline and the side doors carrying over. As part of the changes related to the redesigned front suspension, the entire front fascia was redesigned, with the Explorer gaining model-distinct styling. In a styling theme that would be used in several other Ford small trucks, the 1995 Explorer was given an oval grille; the headlamps were changed from rectangular to oval as well, wrapping into the fenders. Depending on trim, the grille and bumpers were painted gray (XLT), body color (Limited/Sport), or chromed. In contrast to the front fascia, the rear fascia saw relatively few changes, with the rear bumper nearly unchanged. Along with slightly reshaped taillamps (with amber turn signals), the 1995 Ford Explorer marked the debut of a neon CHMSL (center brake light). \n\nAlongside the redesigned exterior, the interior of the second-generation Ford Explorer was given a redesign. Maintaining commonality with the Ranger, the Explorer was given a new dashboard (marking the debut of dual airbags in an American-produced SUV), a new instrument panel; to improve user ergonomics, the Ford Explorer introduced a double-DIN radio panel and rotary-style climate controls. \n\nFor 1997, a third-row seat was introduced as an option; expanding seating to seven passengers, the design was only offered in export markets. \n\nFor 1998, the exterior of the Ford Explorer was given a mid-cycle update. Distinguished by the addition of fender flares, the rear fascia was restyled, with larger taillamps (deleting the amber turn signals); to better accommodate export, the license plate was shifted from the bumper to the liftgate; the neon CHMSL was replaced by an LED version. 16-inch wheels replaced 15-inch wheels (shared with the Ranger). For 1999, the front bumper was redesigned, allowing for larger lower grille and fog lights. \n\nThe interior was given redesigned front and rear seats, along with second-generation airbags; in 1999, side airbags were introduced (as an option). Other options included load-leveling air suspension (on Eddie Bauer and Limited) and a reverse-sensing warning system.\n\nAt its launch, the second-generation Ford Explorer retained the use of the previous trim nomenclature; the standard trim was the XL, with the XLT serving as the primary model upgrade. Along with the two-tone Eddie Bauer trim, the highest trim Explorer was the monochromatic Ford Explorer Limited. For 2000, XLS replaced XL as the base trim (introduced as an appearance package for 1999). \n\nIn contrast to five-door Explorers, second-generation three-door Ford Explorers shifted to a separate trim nomenclature. While the XL remained the base model (largely for fleets), most examples were produced under a single Sport trim level. In 1995, the Expedition trim was introduced; roughly the 3-door equivalent of the Eddie Bauer, the trim was discontinued at the end of the model year as Ford reserved the name for the Ford Expedition full-size SUV (which entered production in mid-1996). \n\nFor 1998, the Explorer Sport became the sole version of the three-door; following the introduction of the third-generation Explorer, the Explorer Sport became a distinct model through the 2003 model year.\n\nThe third-generation Ford Explorer went on sale in January 2001 (as an early 2002 model). The U152 program began in 1995, with the final design being chosen in 1997 and frozen for production in February 1998, with development ending in 2000. The primary objective behind the third-generation Ford Explorer was to make the vehicle line more competitive in both domestic and export markets. Along with tuning the Explorer for higher-speed European driving, the Explorer was benchmarked to lead against the Lexus RX300 and the then-in-development Volkswagen Touareg. \n\nTo make the Explorer more competitive, Ford shifted away from typical SUV design, abandoning the use of the Ford Ranger chassis architecture in favor of designing a purpose-built platform. As part of the change, the Explorer became only the second rear-wheel drive American Ford platform fitted with four-wheel independent suspension (behind the MN12 platform). In another major change, the third-generation Explorer was developed solely as a five-door vehicle. Retaining the previous-generation chassis architecture, the three-door Explorer Sport continued production through the 2003 model year; the Explorer Sport Trac four-door pickup truck continued through 2005. \n\nThe third-generation Ford Explorer was marketed by all three divisions of Ford Motor Company: by Mercury as the second-generation Mercury Mountaineer; Lincoln marketed the third-generation Explorer from 2003 to 2005 as the Lincoln Aviator. \n\nThe third-generation is based on the body-on-frame Ford UN152 platform. No longer derived from the Ford Ranger, the UN152 chassis was designed specifically for the five-door Explorer and its Lincoln-Mercury counterparts. In a major shift from its predecessors, the third-generation Explorer adopted a four-wheel independent suspension configuration, never before used on a Ford truck (on American-produced SUVs, fully independent suspension was previously exclusive to the Hummer H1). Similar to the layout used on the Ford MN12-chassis cars (1989-1998 Thunderbird/Cougar and Lincoln Mark VIII), each rear wheel was connected to the rear-axle differential with two half-shafts.\n\nWhile the third-generation Ford Explorer was in development during the late 1990s controversy involving the Explorer and Firestone tires, the increased stability of the configuration was designed in part to reduce rollover risk. In another change, Firestone tires (which had caused the rollovers and crashes of the Ford Explorers) were not made available on any version of the third-generation Explorer. Ford's AdvanceTrac RSC (Roll Stability Control) system became available as a standard feature on the Explorer for the 2005 model year.\n\nAlong with rear-wheel drive, the third-generation Explorer was offered with both four-wheel drive and permanent all-wheel drive; the latter was offered on the Explorer for the first time. \n\nCarried over from the previous generation, the base engine for the third-generation Explorer was a 210hp 4.0L V6. Becoming the final V8-powered American Ford to adopt to the Modular V8, the third-generation Explorer offered a 239hp 4.6L SOHC V8 (shared with the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis) as its optional engine. A five-speed manual transmission was offered for 2002 before its discontinuation; as of 2018, it is the final year a Ford Explorer was available with a manual transmission. As an option for both the 4.0L and 4.6L V8 engines, the Ford 5R55 transmission was offered, becoming standard from 2003 to 2005. \nIn contrast with the second-generation (a major revision of the 1991-1994 generation), the exterior and interior of the third-generation Ford Explorer were completely new designs. While sharing a number of design elements with the 1997 F-Series and Ford Expedition, the Ford Explorer also served as the introduction of a new design theme for several Ford vehicles; the 2003 Ford Expedition, the Ford Freestar, Ford Freestyle, and Ford Five Hundred would share various elements of the 2002 Ford Explorer design. Retaining nearly the same proportions as the first two generations, the third-generation Explorer was an inch shorter in length and two inches wider, gaining two inches in wheelbase.\n\nWith the addition of independent rear suspension, several functional changes were brought as part of the redesign. The cargo floor was lowered several inches, adding nearly 10 cubic feet of total cargo room. Coinciding with the lower cargo floor, on nearly all models, a folding third-row seat was either standard or an option, bringing seating capacity to seven. The rear liftgate was redesigned, with the upper hatch enlarged.\n\nCarried over from the previous generation, Ford produced the Explorer in four trim levels, XLS, XLT, Eddie Bauer, and Limited. Slotted below the XLS were two major trim packages, Sport Value, Sport Choice, with Sport Premium between XLS and XLT. The outdoors-themed Eddie Bauer continued production with a two-tone exterior (with a tan lower body); the Limited wore a monochromatic body.\n\nThe \"Ford Explorer\" and the \"Mercury Mountaineer\" were both updated for the 2006 model year on a new frame, produced by \"Magna International\" rather than \"Tower Automotive\". Along with this new, stronger chassis, Ford updated the interior, redesigned the rear suspension and added power-folding third-row seats. Also, a tire pressure monitoring system and electronic stability control became standard equipment. Power running boards, like the ones from the Lincoln Navigator, were also made available on the Explorer and Mountaineer; the running boards lower to allow easier access when entering the vehicle, then retract upon door closure. Unlike previous generations, there was no right-hand drive option available for order, causing Ford to market Explorers in Japan in left-hand drive configuration. The LHD Explorers were desirable there because LHD vehicles are considered prestigious in Japan. Moreover, Ford switched to a one-piece rear liftgate design due to the problems associated with the previous generation's design.\n\nThe 4.0L 12-valve SOHC V-6 was once again the standard engine. A more powerful 4.6L 24-valve SOHC V-8, similar to the Fifth-generation Ford Mustang's engine, was available as an option. The 6-speed 6R automatic transmission, built by Ford and based on a ZF design, was made standard equipment with the V-8 engine as well. The five-speed 5R55W automatic transmission was advanced. It was the only transmission available for the V-6 engine, because the Mazda five-speed manual transmission was dropped in the previous generation.\n\nThe 2006 Ford Explorer was nominated for the \"North American Truck of the Year\" award for 2006.\n\nIn 2007, The Explorer received a few minor updates including standard AUX input on all stereos and optional power running boards, heated windshield, Ironman Package, XLT Appearance Package, and heated leather seat package.\n\nFor 2008, Ford added side curtain airbags across the Explorer range. Also, the optional satellite navigation system was also upgraded with voice control.\n\nFor 2009, the Explorer received a trailer sway control system as standard equipment, and the navigation system received traffic flow monitoring with updated gas prices from nearby stations.\n\nFor the 2010 model year, Ford's MyKey became standard on all Explorer trims.\n\nThe second generation Sport Trac came out in early 2006 for the 2007 model year. Unlike its predecessor sold through 2005, it featured the V-8 engine as an option and was based on this generation Explorer's platform. \"AdvanceTrac\" with \"Roll Stability Control\" was made standard on the Sport Trac.\n\nFor the 2007 model year, the Ford Special Vehicle Team built the \"Sport Trac Adrenalin\" concept with a supercharged version of the 4.6 L \"Modular\" V-8, with , and featuring wheels. Ford SVT said then it was the successor to the F-150 Lightning sports pickup truck. However, the SVT version of the Adrenalin was cancelled in a cost-cutting move as part of \"The Way Forward\". The Adrenalin was sold as an appearance package though from 2008-2010. It had blacked out headlights, black grill, mono color interior, different front and rear bumpers, vents in the front fenders and molded in running boards. It also came standard with 20\" polished aluminum wheels, and the fender flares that came on the Explorer and standard Sport Trac were deleted.\nFord unveiled an Explorer America concept vehicle at the 2008 North American International Auto Show. The Explorer America concept is built on a unibody platform to reduce weight and improve driveability, migrating from the body-on-frame platform of the fourth generation Explorer. It is designed for up to six passengers while improving fuel economy by 20 to 30 percent relative to the current V6 Explorer. The powertrain packages in the concept vehicle include a two-liter four-cylinder turbocharged direct injection \"EcoBoost\" gas engine with and of torque, and a 3.5L V6 version \"EcoBoost\" with and up to of torque.\n\nThe 5th generation 2011 Explorer bore similarity to the Explorer America concept's construction, and includes a unibody structure based on the D4 platform, a modified version of the D3 platform. The move from traditional SUV to crossover effectively vacated the midsize SUV segment for Ford until the revived Ford Bronco goes on sale for 2020.\n\nThe fifth generation Explorer features blacked-out A, B, and D-pillars to produce a \"floating roof\" effect similar to Land Rover's floating roof design used on its sport utility vehicles; a design which Ford previously used on the Ford Flex. The fifth generation Explorer features sculpted body work with stepped style headlamps similar to the Flex, Edge, Escape, Expedition and F-150, as well as new stepped style tail lamps. The grille features Ford's corporate three-bar design with upper and lower perforated mesh work, similar to that of the sixth-generation Ford Taurus.\n\nThe development of the fifth generation Explorer was led by chief engineer Jim Holland, who was also a chief engineer for Land Rover; heading development of the Land Rover Range Rover (L322) 2005 facelift. Holland also worked on the Ford Expedition (U324) during its initial development.\n\nThe fifth generation Explorer made its debut online on July 26, 2010. Ford had set up a Ford Explorer Facebook page ahead of its debut. Assembly of the fifth-generation Explorer moved to Ford's Chicago Assembly plant, where it is built alongside the Ford Taurus and Lincoln MKS. The Louisville plant, where the previous generation was built, was converted to produce cars based on Ford's global C platform (potentially including the Ford Focus, Ford C-Max, and Ford Kuga). Like the Escape, the Explorer will continue to be marketed as an \"SUV\" rather than a \"crossover SUV\". It went on sale in late 2010, pre-launch sales had by the end of November 2010 totaled around 15,000. The EPA rated fuel economy of 20/28 mpg city/highway for the four-cylinder EcoBoost engine option.\n\nAvailable features on the fifth generation Explorer include intelligent access with push button start, remote engine start, power liftgate, power adjustable pedals with memory, premium leather trimmed seating, heated and cooled front seats, dual headrest DVD entertainment system, adaptive cruise control, active park assist, SIRIUS Travel Link, MyFord Touch, Ford SYNC by Microsoft, Sony audio system with HD radio and Apple iTunes tagging, in-dash advanced navigation system, SoundScreen laminated acoustic and solar tinted windshield with rain-sensing wipers, 20-inch polished V-spoke aluminium wheels, and High-intensity discharge headlamps (HID) and LED tail lamps.\n\nUnlike the Explorer America concept vehicle which only seats five occupants, the production Explorer holds two rows of seating with available \"PowerFold\" fold flat third row seating (like the previous generation) and accommodates up to seven occupants.\n\nThe Explorer is available in either front-wheel drive or full-time all-wheel drive. At first only one engine was available: the ( of torque) 3.5 liter TiVCT (Twin independent Variable Camshaft Timing) V-6 attached to either the 6-speed 6F automatic or 6-speed 6F \"SelectShift\" automatic.\n\nSoon thereafter, Ford offered the economical ( of torque) 2 liter \"EcoBoost\" turbocharged, direct-injected I-4 mated to the 6-speed 6F automatic. The I-4 engine is not available with the optional 6-speed 6F SelectShift automatic, and will only be available in front-wheel drive.\n\nThe Explorer is available with an automatic intelligent all-wheel drive system inspired by Land Rover, featuring a variable center multi-disc differential with computer controlled lock. Conventional front and rear differentials are used with 3.39:1 gearing. The center multi-disc differential controls the front-to-rear torque split, biasing as much as 100 percent of torque to either the front or rear wheels. Depending on the Terrain Management mode selected, the center multi-disc differential's intelligent lock will allow for a 50:50 torque split in off-road conditions. The power take off (PTO) unit includes a heavy-duty dedicated cooling system to allow the four-wheel drive system to supply continuous non-stop torque delivery to all four wheels indefinitely, without overheating. A \"4WD\" badge is advertised on the rear liftgate on the all-wheel drive models. Explorer's overall off-road crawl ratio is 15.19:1 with high range – no low range – gearing only.\n\nOff-road electronics include Hill Descent Control (HDC), Hill Ascent Assist (HAA), four-wheel electronic traction control and Terrain Management.\n\nFour-wheel electronic traction control (ABS braking) is employed to simulate front and rear differential locks via aggressively \"brake locking\" the front or rear differentials, transferring up to 100 percent of torque from side-to-side. In the right conditions, the Explorer can keep moving even if only one wheel has traction, regardless of which wheel it is.\n\nTerrain Management includes four selectable modes. Each mode is selected via a rotary control dial on the center console, aft of the transmission shifter.\n\nDepending on the mode selected, Terrain Management will control, adjust, and fine tune the engine, transmission, center multi-disc differential lock, throttle response, four-wheel electronic traction control and electronic stability control (ESC) to adapt the SUV for optimal performance on the corresponding terrain.\n\nOff-road geometry figures for approach, departure and ramp brakeover angles are 21°, 21° and 16° respectively. Minimum running ground clearance is . Standard running ground clearance is . Low hanging running boards are no longer offered from the factory to help increase side obstacle clearance.\n\nMoving to a monocoque body usually has a negative impact on towing capacity. The new Explorer will be available with an optional trailer tow package. The package includes a Class III trailer hitch, engine oil cooler, trailer electrics connector, trailer sway control (TSC), wiring harness and a rear-view camera with trailer alignment assistance to help in backing up to a trailer. If equipped with the trailer tow package the new 2011 Explorer will be able to tow up to of braked trailer. That is greater than the towing capacity stated for the Explorer America concept and less than the outgoing Explorer's towing capacity, although that was only available with the 4.6 L V8 engine.\n\nSafety features include: Dual front adaptive SRS air bags, dual front seat side impact air bags, dual rear safety belt air bags (available first quarter, 2011) and side curtain head, torso and rollover protection air bags. Other optional safety features include BLIS blind spot information system with rear cross traffic alert, forward collision warning with brake support precrash system, Auto high-beam, Roll Stability Control (RSC), Electronic stability control (ESC) and Curve Control.\n\nThe fifth-generation Explorer was the first-ever vehicle to be equipped with inflatable dual rear inflatable safety belts. Air bags are sewn into the inside of the seat belts, and inflate with cold air to prevent burns. Ford claims it will be released as an option and to introduce inflatable seat belts on other Ford models eventually.\n\nThe fifth generation Ford Explorer earned the 2011 \"North American Truck of the Year\" award. The rear inflatable seat belts won the 2011 Best New Technology Award from the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada.\n\nThe Ford Explorer Sport was announced March 28, 2012 as an option for the 2013 model year and went on sale in June 2012. The \"Sport\" trim level comprises blackened exterior treatments, stiffened chassis and suspension, larger brakes and the installation of the EcoBoost 3.5L Twin Turbo V6 rated at and of torque. It is the only version to feature a combined 4WD/EcoBoost option (a FWD version is not being offered for the Sport trim), allowing its MPG to average between 16/city and 22/highway. This version will be slotted above the Limited trim and is expected to compete in this segment against Jeep Grand Cherokee's SRT trim and Dodge Durango's R/T trims and a newly updated 2013 Chevrolet Traverse, the latter of which unveiled their new look on the same day as the Explorer Sport as their response to Ford's news.\n\nThe refreshed 2016 model year Ford Explorer debuted at the 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show, with a redesigned front fascia, hood and lower bumper, standard LED low-beam headlights, and fog lamps that were inspired by the thirteenth generation Ford F-150. The rear of the Explorer was also refreshed with restyled LED tail lamps and dual exhaust outlets. The 2016 refresh bumped the I4 engine to a 2.3 Liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine from the 2015 Ford Mustang. A newly introduced Platinum trim now tops out the range, slotting above the Sport and Limited trims. Similar to the Platinum editions of the F150 and Ford Super Duty trucks, the Platinum trim features front and rear cameras, enhanced active park assist with perpendicular park assist, park-out assist and semi-automatic parallel parking, hands-free liftgate from the Ford Escape, an exclusive 500-watt Sony surround sound system, and a heated steering-wheel. The Platinum trim is paired with a 3.5 Liter EcoBoost Twin-turbo V6 with 365 horsepower which was previously only available with the Sport trim. The 2016 Explorer went on sale at dealerships in the Summer of 2015. Other than the addition of the top-of-the-line Platinum trim, as well as standard eighteen-inch alloy wheels on the base Explorer trim, the changes are mainly in styling, exterior and interior color combinations, technology, and power.\n\nThe Ford Explorer will receive a second facelift which will include a refreshed front end with revised LED headlights and redesigned LED fog lights plus new exterior colors, new interior colors, and new wheel designs.\n\nAn all-new, sixth-generation Ford Explorer will debut in 2019 for the 2020 model year, and is slated to return to a Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (FR Setup) utilizing Rear Wheel Drive (RWD), as utilized by all Ford Explorers prior to 2011. Ford showed a prototype 2020 Explorer under wraps on display at the 2018 Beijing Auto Show in China. A high-performance Explorer ST is also planned, joining the Ford Edge ST as Ford's second SUV from their ST performance lineup. The former is expected to be powered by a Twin-Turbocharged EcoBoost V6 gasoline engine that could produce over 400 horsepower. \n\nA prototype of the sixth-generation Ford Explorer has been seen testing, and appears similar in design to the all-new 2018 Ford Expedition and Expedition EL. \n\nThe Ford Explorer Sport was a 3-door version of the Ford Explorer, designed to take the place of the Bronco II in Ford's model line, and was produced from 1991 to 2003. The Sport began as a trim level of the Ford Explorer, but it eventually became its own model. It rode on a 10\" shorter wheelbase. There was only one Sport, but there were several other trim levels of the Explorer that were available with 2-doors, such as the XL (1991–1997), the Eddie Bauer (1991–1994), and the Expedition (1995). In 1998 the Explorer Sport became the only 3-door trim level of the Explorer, and in 2001 it became its own model, as the second generation Explorer moved on to a 5-door-only 3rd generation. Production ceased in July 2003.\nThe Explorer Sport returned to the Fifth generation Explorer however the Fifth generation Explorer Sport has 4 doors instead of the 2 doors of the old Explorer sport but has a unique engine and styling compared to the regular Explorer\n\nThe Mazda Navajo is a rebadged version of the first-generation Ford Explorer Sport that was sold during the 1991 to 1994 model years. It was Mazda's first sport-utility vehicle in North America and was sold exclusively in the United States (Mazda's Canadian division declined to market the vehicle). At its launch, the Navajo was sold in a single configuration, a three-door body with four-wheel drive. As with the Explorer, it was assembled at the Louisville Assembly Plant. The Navajo was \"Motor Trend\" magazine's Truck of the Year for 1991. The Navajo was not offered in Japan.\n\nThe Navajo and Explorer Sport largely differed in exterior trim, with unique taillights, grille, front bumper, and wheels. Inside, the two were nearly impossible to distinguish from one another, except for minor changes to seat fabrics, the typeface on the instrument cluster, and the Navajo was given a different design for its steering wheel hub. Similar to the 3-door Explorer, the Navajo came in two trim levels: base (renamed DX for 1992) and LX. In contrast to the Explorer, the base version of the Navajo offered power windows, power locks and power mirrors as standard. The LX added features such as extra interior illumination and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. An optional premium package loaded up the Navajo with luxuries including air conditioning, a stereo system with cassette deck, cruise control, sport seats with power lumbar adjustment and a pop-up/removable moonroof.\n\nFor 1992, the Navajo became available with rear-wheel drive, geared towards buyers who liked the sporty image of an SUV, but did not need four-wheel drive. Aside from the nomenclature change of the base model to DX (to fit Mazda's naming scheme), the Navajo changed so little that the company reused much of the photography from its 1991 promotional materials for another year. For 1993, the Navajo received mechanical upgrades alongside the Explorer, such as increased power for the V6 engine and four-wheel anti-lock brakes. Unlike the Explorer, however, the only other change was an optional CD player. For 1994, the LX model was given 5-spoke alloy wheels.\n\nIn comparison to the Explorer, sales of the Navajo were relatively poor and it was discontinued after the 1994 model year. Mazda would not market another sport utility vehicle in North America until the Tribute (based on the Ford Escape) launched for the 2001 model year.\n\nFollowing the end of production of the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor in 2011, Ford began development of a police-service variant of the Ford Explorer. For the 2013 model year, Ford introduced the Police Interceptor Utility; as with the related Police Interceptor Sedan variant of the Ford Taurus, the Utility is referred to as a Ford Police Interceptor in lieu of being a Ford Explorer. \n\nAs with the Police Interceptor Sedan and the Ford Expedition SSV, the Utility is not sold for retail sale and is specifically designed for use by law enforcement or use by other emergency service agencies. Along with fleet-specific options such as steel wheels and provisions for user-specific paint schemes (such as contrasting doors), the Utility comes with provisions for the fitment of emergency equipment such as radios, lightbars and sirens. To free up interior space on the center console for equipment, the transmission is fitted with a column-mounted shifter. \n\nThe Police Interceptor Utility comes with an all-wheel drive powertrain standard. Over a standard Explorer, the Utility is fitted with larger brake rotors, more advanced ABS and traction control systems, a more efficient cooling system and other standard police equipment. \n\nAt its launch, the initial engine fitted was a 305hp 3.7L version of the Ti-VCT V6, shared with the Ford Mustang and F-150. For 2014, Ford added the 365hp 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (shared with the Police Interceptor Sedan and Ford Taurus SHO). \n\nThe California Highway Patrol now uses the Police Interceptor Utility because the current Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Caprice and Dodge Charger patrol cars did not meet the payload the CHP requires for a universal patrol car. In May 2014, statisticians R.L. Polk declared the PI Utility the most popular police vehicle, based on 2013 U.S. sales figures.\n\nIn the UK, the Ford Explorer was initially available as just one model, with the 4.0-litre engine and with a high specification – the only dealer options being leather interior. Second and third-generation Explorers for the UK and other RHD markets utilised a center console-mounted shifter and hand parking brake instead of the steering column-mounted shifter and parking brake pedal used in the North American models. In 1998, a facelifted Explorer was available with minor cosmetic interior changes and a revised rear tail lift which centered the rear number plate. In 1999 the model range was revamped slightly, the base model becoming the XLT and a special edition North Face version marketed with a tie in to North Face outdoor clothing. The North Face version was available in a dark green or a silver, with body-colored bumpers, heated leather seats and a CD multichanger as standard. In 2000, the North Face was also available in black. With the introduction of the all-new platform in 2002, Ford withdrew the Explorer from the UK and EU/EFTA market.\n\nIn the Middle East, Taiwan, and China, the 2012 Ford Explorer is currently available in several trims, all of which have a 3.5-liter V6 engine and an automatic gearbox. Some GCC markets offer the front-wheel-drive version as a base model, while most of the trims have standard all-wheel-drive. The latest generation Explorer was made available in Japan the Fall of 2015.\n\nAs of 2009, American-made Explorer is exported to Bolivia, Chile, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Dominican Republic, People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Republic of China (Taiwan), The Philippines, Turkey, Russia, Iceland, the Middle East, and certain countries in South America and Africa.\n\nAs of 2014, the Explorer is available in Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nGothic black Ford Explorer vehicles are also used by federal agencies, such as Secret Service for example.\n\n240 deaths and 3,000 catastrophic injuries resulted from the combination of early generation Explorers and Firestone tires. The tire tread separated and the vehicle had an unusually high rate of rollover crash as a result. Both companies' reputations were tarnished. This event led to a disruption in the 90-year-old Ford/Firestone partnership.\n\nRollover risk is inherently higher in truck-based vehicles, like the Explorer, than in ordinary passenger cars, as modification for bulky 4-wheel-drive hardware requires increases in height to avoid compromising ground clearance (raising the center of gravity), while a short wheelbase further reduces stability. The previous Bronco II had already been cited by Consumer Reports for rollover tendencies in turns.\n\nThe Explorer was cleared by the NHTSA as no more dangerous than any other truck when driven unsafely. It used the same tires as the Ford Ranger with a relatively low rating for high temperatures. Lowering tire pressure recommendations softened the ride further and improved emergency stability through increased traction, but increased the chances of overheating tires. A 1995 redesign with a new suspension slightly raised the Explorer's center of gravity, but it was called inconsequential by a Ford spokesman. Memos by Ford engineers suggested lowering the engine height, but it would have increased the cost of the new design.\n\nExplorer rollover rates, at the time of the controversy, were higher than any of its competitors. While Firestone turned out millions of sub-standard and potentially defective tires, and was the initial cause of loss of control many Ford Explorer Firestone tire tread separation rollovers, the blame shifted towards Ford for a defectively designed and unstable vehicle .\n\nIn May 2000, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) contacted Ford and Firestone about a higher than normal incidence of tire failures on Ford Explorers, Mercury Mountaineers, and Mazda Navajos fitted with Firestone tires (later including Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickup trucks). The failures all involved \"tread separation\", in which the outer tread carcass would delaminate and cause a rapid loss of tire pressure. Ford investigated and found that several models of Firestone tires (\"ATX\", \"ATX II\", and \"Wilderness AT\") had higher failure rates, especially those made at Firestone's Decatur, Illinois plant.\n\nFord recommended a tire inflation of only likely contributing to the tread separation problem by causing the tires to operate at higher than normal temperatures.\n\nFord argued that Firestone was at fault, noting that the tires made by Firestone were very defective. Nevertheless, Ford subsequently recommended that front and rear tires should be inflated to on all Explorer models and mailed a replacement tire pressure door sticker indicating the same to all registered owners.\n\nSome have argued that poor driver reaction to tire blowout was a contributing factor. When a tire blew, the vehicle would experience a sudden sharp jerk, and many drivers reacted by counter-steering in an attempt to regain control. This action would cause a shift of the vehicle's weight, resulting in a rollover especially at higher speeds (many reports of rollovers were of vehicles being driven at speeds of and above). In a test simulating dozens of tire blowouts, Larry Webster, a test-driver for \"Car & Driver\" magazine, was repeatedly able to bring a 1994 Explorer to a stop without incident from speeds of . According to \"Forbes\" magazine, car experts and NHTSA claim that the vast majority of crash accidents and deaths are caused not by the vehicle, but by the driver, by road conditions or some combination of the two. Many vehicle injury attorneys dissent from this view.\n\nIn response to Firestone's allegations of the Explorer's design defects, NHTSA undertook a preliminary investigation and reported that further action was not required. Its conclusion was that the Explorer was no more prone to rollover than other SUVs given their high center of gravity. The subsequent introduction and proliferation of electronic stability control systems have essentially addressed and mitigated this shortcoming.\n\nIn May 2001, Ford announced it would replace 13 million Firestone tires fitted to Explorer vehicles.\n\nOn December 22, 2003, U-Haul, the largest American equipment rental company, announced it would prohibit its outlets from renting trailers to persons planning to tow behind Ford Explorers due to liability concerns, with no published data to substantiate the claim. Unofficial reports from employees indicated that it was due to the rear bumper separating from the vehicle, including the tow hook assembly. U-Haul did not alter its policies regarding the renting of trailers to persons planning to tow behind the Mercury Mountaineer, Mazda Navajo or earlier versions of the Lincoln Aviator, which are all mechanically identical to the Ford Explorer. In mid-2013, U-Haul began allowing Ford Explorers of model year 2011 and newer to tow their trailers. All other Ford Motor Company vehicles are allowed to tow U-Haul trailers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8020383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8020383", "title": "Garuda Indonesia Flight 152", "text": "Garuda Indonesia Flight 152\n\nGaruda Indonesia Flight 152 was a scheduled domestic Indonesian passenger flight from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta to Polonia International Airport in Medan, North Sumatra, operated by Garuda Indonesia using an Airbus A300B4 registered PK-GAI.\n\nOn 26 September 1997, Flight 152, on final approach into Polonia International Airport, crashed into mountainous woodlands from Medan during low visibility caused by the 1997 Southeast Asian haze. All 234 passengers and crew were killed. The crash site was in a ravine near the village of Buah Nabar in the Sibolangit district south of Medan. With 234 fatalities, it is the deadliest airline disaster in Indonesia's history.\n\nThe aircraft was an Airbus A300B4 FFCC, or \"forward-facing crew concept.\" The FFCC model is a modified version of the A300B4 in which the flight engineer station is eliminated, and the relevant controls are simplified and relocated to be positioned on the overhead panel between the two pilots. This control arrangement is similar to the Airbus A310 series, the difference being that the FFCC retains most of the analogue flight instrumentation of the original A300. The FFCC would later be developed into the A300-600 series, in which all elements of the flight deck are brought to A310 standards, including the addition of electronic flight instrumentation. The two pilots aboard the accident flight were qualified to fly both the FFCC and the -600 model, however the adequacy of their conversion training between the two would later be called into question.\nAt approximately 1:00pm, air traffic controllers in Medan cleared Flight 152 for an ILS approach into Runway 05 from its current 316 degree heading. The crew, led by Captain Rahmo Wiyogo, 42, a pilot with over 20 years of flying experience at Garuda Indonesia and more than 12,000 flying hours, and First Officer Tata Zuwaldi, a former flight engineer who recently upgraded to pilot, was instructed to turn left heading 240 degrees to intercept the ILS beacon. 120 seconds prior to impact, the crew was asked to turn left further, to 215 degrees, and descend to 2000 feet. At 1:30pm, Medan directed the flight to turn right heading to a heading of 046 to line up for arrival into Runway 05, and asked the crew to report which direction the plane was travelling. Air traffic controllers then became confused as to which plane they were talking to, as another flight with the same number (Merpati Nusantara Airlines Flight 152) was also in the area at the time.\n\nEarlier in the day, another Flight 152, Merpati Nusantara Airlines Flight 152, was handled by the same air traffic controller. This led to the controller mistakenly saying \"Merpati one five two turn left heading 240 to intercept runway zero five from the right side\"; as the wrong call sign was used, the Garuda pilots disregarded these instructions. The controller, on not receiving a response, queried the pilots on if they heard the instructions; this time the correct call sign \"Indonesia 152\" was used. The controller then repeated his instructions, though he did not say that the flight would be making its approach on the south side of the runway, or right side. The pilots believed they were flying the approach on the north side of the airport, as was the approach on the approach chart the pilots were using. Thus, when the pilots were instructed to turn right to a heading of 046 maintaining 2,000 ft to capture the localizer for the ILS to Runway 05, out of habit – or possibly due to the approach chart – the captain initiated a left turn to a heading of 046. The First Officer was distracted during the turn and did not notice for a while that the aircraft was turning left. When he did notice, he told the captain he was turning the wrong way, and the captain questioned the controller over which way they needed to turn, to which the controller confirmed they were to turn right. A confusing conversation took place over which way to turn, with the controller not having a clear picture over what the flight was doing, due the Medan radar system having a refresh time of 12 seconds.\n\nWithout a constant up-to-date view over the flight's heading, the controller thought the plane was continuing left, when it was actually turning right and into high terrain. During this time the flight descended through 2,000 ft due to the captain inputting the wrong altitude of 1,500 ft. The pilots did not notice this due to the poor visibility from the 1997 Southeast Asian haze. Five seconds prior to the initial impact with trees, the First Officer made a comment about the airplane's altitude. The FDR recorded increases in pitch and engine power, likely commanded by the crew in an effort to correct their altitude. Shortly before the recording ended, the cockpit voice recorder registered the sound of the plane striking trees, followed by shouting from the pilots. The aircraft crashed into the ground at 1:34 pm, killing all 234 people on board.\n\nThe passengers were mostly Indonesian, with six Japanese, four Germans, three Taiwanese, two Americans, two British, two Canadians, one Australian, one Belgian, one Dutch, one French, one Italian, one Malaysian, and one Swedish.\n\nForty-eight of the bodies recovered from the crash were never identified and were buried in a mass grave in a cemetery outside Medan's Polonia Airport, where 61 victims of the 1979 Garuda Fokker F28 crash were also buried. The remaining 186 bodies were identified and returned to their families for private burial.\n\nOne of the passengers killed in the crash was Singaporean businessman Yanto Tonoto, the younger brother of Sukanto Tanoto.\n\nThe causes of the crash, according to the official report of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC), were:\n\n\"There was confusion regarding turning direction of left turn instead of right turn at critical position during radar vectoring that reduced the flight crew’s vertical awareness while they were concentrating on the aircraft’s lateral changes. These caused the aircraft to continue descending below the assigned altitude of 2000 ft and hit treetops at 1550 ft above mean sea level.\"\n\nThe Report also criticized the airline's conversion training for pilots who fly both the A300-600 and A300B4-FF models. The former is equipped with digital navigation displays, while the latter is equipped with analog equipment. Though both are sufficient for conducting instrument approaches, the captain may have been overwhelmed due to his lack of familiarity with the analog instrumentation.\n\nContributing to the accident was the failure of the GPWS for undetermined reasons and the inadequate vectoring charts used by the controllers at Medan.\n\nThe first lawsuit was filed by Nolan Law Group in Chicago, Illinois on September 24, 1998 on behalf of American passengers Fritz and Djoeminah Baden. Additional lawsuits were filed in state and federal courts in Chicago related to many more victims from Indonesia, Germany, England, Italy, and Australia. The sole defendant in the lawsuits was Sundstrand Corporation (later Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation), the company that designed and manufactured the Mark-II ground proximity warning system (\"GPWS\") installed on the Airbus 300. The plaintiffs alleged that the GPWS was defectively designed, that the manufacturer was aware of its deficiencies in mountainous terrain for over a decade, and had the system worked as designed the accident could have been avoided. Had the aircraft been fitted with EGPWS the crew would have had the alarm sound between 18 and 23 seconds before impact; the accident would have been avoided.\n\nThe victims' lawyers produced several internal memos from Hamilton-Sundstrand showing that the system had been inadequately tested for mountainous terrain, having been mostly tested on flat ground with gentle slopes. Perhaps the most critical memo was one written by Hamilton-Sundstrand engineer Donald Bateman, who wrote: \"Based on recent flight demonstrations ... of the MK II GPWS, I have become very concerned about the Excessive Rate Detector Circuits in the MK II computers. I believe we have a much more potentially serious problem than was first envisioned in 1982. GPWS warnings can be short or non-existent in some circumstances.\" Bateman's memo went on to say that \"the warning time for flight into mountainous terrain and steep descent rates from altitudes above the range of the radio altimeter can be very short and erratic at times ... From our studies, the average escape margin is only three-and-one-half seconds for the typical mountainous-terrain accident scenario.\" Sundstrand's in-house experts conducted their own after-crash simulations and confirmed that a properly functioning warning system should have sounded alarms about 14 seconds before impact and that the accident would have been avoided if that had occurred.\n\nNearly six years after the crash the lawsuit was settled out of court.\n\nIn \"Coyle v. P.T. Garuda Indonesia\", Joyce Coyle filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against the Indonesian government subsidiary that operates Garuda Indonesia Airlines. Coyle alleged in her complaint that Garuda was liable for wrongful death under the Warsaw Convention. She also claimed that Garuda, which is wholly owned by the Indonesian government, could be held liable under two exceptions to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. She contended that because Garuda was authorized to operate in the United States at the time, the immunity had been explicitly waived under the rules of the Department of Transportation, which requires foreign air carriers to open themselves to suit in the United States as a condition of being allowed to fly to, from, or within this country. The waiver is limited to actions arising under treaties. Coyle also claimed that by selling tickets in the United States, Garuda waived immunity under the \"commercial activity\" exception to the FSIA. U.S. District Judge Robert E. Jones denied Garuda’s motion to dismiss, adopting a magistrate judge’s conclusion that the trip to Medan was \"one leg of an international journey\" and thus subject to the Warsaw Convention and the explicit waiver of immunity.\n\nOn appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Circuit Judge Diarmuid F. O’Scannlain, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, rejected Garuda’s claim that a flight between two points in the same country will always fall outside the scope of the waiver. But the Ninth Circuit agreed with Garuda that under the circumstances, the Badens’ trip to Medan did not constitute \"international air transportation\" within the meaning of the Warsaw Convention. The facts that the tickets did not reference any international travel, were purchased in Indonesia from a source independent of the travel agent who sold them the U.S.-Indonesia tickets, and were labeled \"DOMESTIK\" unambiguously established that the flight was not part of their international journey as contemplated by the treaty, O’Scannlain said.\n\nThe court explained:\n\"[T]he crux of this litigation is whether Flight 152 was a part of [the] larger international trip for purposes of the Warsaw Convention...whether it was a component of 'one undivided transportation...regarded by the parties as a single operation'...or just a late-added, purely domestic side trip apart from their international itinerary with its own final destination. The Badens' tickets for Flight 152 are powerful, unambiguous evidence of the latter.\"\n\nNor was the court persuaded by Coyle's \"commercial activity\" argument. For the exception to apply, O’Scannlain noted, the statute requires that the action arise from “a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state...or upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere [when such] act causes a direct effect in the United States.” The fact that Garuda sold tickets in the United States did not furnish a sufficient nexus to subject its domestic flights to the exception, the judge wrote. Senior Judge Ferdinand F. Fernandez and Judge Raymond C. Fisher joined in the opinion that ended Coyle's suit.\n\nGaruda Indonesia's fleet of ATR 72-600 aircraft use the same registration numbers as their previous fleet of Airbus A300, meaning that the registration PK-GAI was passed onto a currently-in-service ATR 72-600.\n\nThe crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 is featured in the Fifth Episode on the Season 17 of \"Mayday\" (\"Air Crash Investigation\"). The episode is titled \"Lethal Turn\".\n\nGaruda Indonesia still uses GA-152 flight number, but now used on Jakarta - Batam route operated by Boeing 737-800.\n\n\n"}

Additionally, geotechnical investigations are also used to measure the thermal resistivity of soils or backfill materials required for underground transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, radioactive waste disposal, and solar thermal storage facilities. A geotechnical investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, geophysical methods are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves soil sampling and laboratory tests of the soil samples retrieved.\n\nSurface exploration can include geologic mapping, geophysical methods, and photogrammetry, or it can be as simple as a geotechnical professional walking around on the site to observe the physical conditions at the site.\n\nTo obtain information about the soil conditions below the surface, some form of subsurface exploration is required. Methods of observing the soils below the surface, obtaining samples, and determining physical properties of the soils and rocks include test pits, trenching (particularly for locating faults and slide planes), boring, and in situ tests.\n\nBorings come in two main varieties, large-diameter and small-diameter. Large-diameter borings are rarely used due to safety concerns and expense but are sometimes used to allow a geologist or an engineer to visually and manually examine the soil and rock stratigraphy in-situ. Small-diameter borings are frequently used to allow a geologist or engineer to examine soil or rock cuttings or to retrieve samples at depth using soil samplers, and to perform in-place soil tests.\n\nSoil samples are often categorized as being either \"disturbed\" or \"undisturbed;\" however, \"undisturbed\" samples are not truly undisturbed. A disturbed sample is one in which the structure of the soil has been changed sufficiently that tests of structural properties of the soil will not be representative of in-situ conditions, and only properties of the soil grains (e.g., grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, and possibly the water content) can be accurately determined. An undisturbed sample is one where the condition of the soil in the sample is close enough to the conditions of the soil in-situ to allow tests of structural properties of the soil to be used to approximate the properties of the soil in-situ.\n\nOffshore soil collection introduces many difficult variables. In shallow water, work can be done off a barge. In deeper water a ship will be required. Deepwater soil samplers are normally variants of Kullenberg-type samplers, a modification on a basic gravity corer using a piston (Lunne and Long, 2006). Seabed samplers are also available, which push the collection tube slowly into the soil.\n\nSoil samples are taken using a variety of samplers; some provide only disturbed samples, while others can provide relatively undisturbed samples.\n\n\nA flat plate dilatometer test (DMT) is a flat plate probe often advanced using CPT rigs, but can also be advanced from conventional drill rigs. A diaphragm on the plate applies a lateral force to the soil materials and measures the strain induced for various levels of applied stress at the desired depth interval.\n\nIn-situ gas tests can be carried out in the boreholes on completion and in probe holes made in the sides of the trial pits as part of the site investigation. Testing is normally with a portable meter, which measures the methane content as its percentage volume in air. The corresponding oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations are also measured. A more accurate method used to monitor over the longer term, consists of gas monitoring standpipes should be installed in boreholes. These typically comprise slotted uPVC pipework surrounded by single sized gravel. The top 0.5 m to 1.0 m of pipework is usually not slotted and is surrounded by bentonite pellets to seal the borehole. Valves are fitted and the installations protected by lockable stopcock covers normally fitted flush with the ground. Monitoring is again with a portable meter and is usually done on a fortnightly or monthly basis.\n\nA wide variety of laboratory tests can be performed on soils to measure a wide variety of soil properties. Some soil properties are intrinsic to the composition of the soil matrix and are not affected by sample disturbance, while other properties depend on the structure of the soil as well as its composition, and can only be effectively tested on relatively undisturbed samples. Some soil tests measure direct properties of the soil, while others measure \"index properties\" which provide useful information about the soil without directly measuring the property desired.\nGeophysical methods are used in geotechnical investigations to evaluate a site's behavior in a seismic event. By measuring a soil's shear wave velocity, the dynamic response of that soil can be estimated. There are a number of methods used to determine a site's shear wave velocity:\nOther methods:\n\n\n"}

The company produces and sells anaerobic digesters that convert organic waste into methane gas and liquid fertilizer.\n\nIn 2007, HomeBioGas cofounder Yair Teller observed small biogas systems in Mexico. Inspired, he traveled to other developing nations to learn more.\nTeller, and cofounder Oshik Efrati, acquired many biogas systems from China and India. They installed them locally, quickly judging them to work poorly.\nParticularly, Teller and Efrati believed these systems suffered from poor efficiency, unpleasant odors and insect infestations. \n\nIn 2012, Teller and Efrati, now joined by final co-founder Erez Lancer, formally created HomeBiogas.\n\nIsrael's Ministry of Environmental Protection, in 2014, purchased HomeBiogas units, distributing them to Umm Batin Bedouin village. Shortly afterwards, the Ministry purchased 25 additional systems and again distributed them to Umm Batin, and another Negev Bedouin village. Similarly, HomeBiogas has also supplied biodigesters to Bedouins in the Negev in conjunction with the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies.\n\nAfter learning of the Umm Batin program, multiple governments reached out to HomeBiogas. Prominent among them is the Dominican Republic, whose government purchased 50 HomeBiogas appliances in an effort to reduce citizen dependence on wood for heating.\n\nThe European Union and the Peres Center for Peace contracted HomeBiogas to install HomeBiogas digesters in the central West Bank's Jordan Valley in 2015. Approximately 40 digesters were installed, with the European Union providing the 500,000 euros in funding.\n\nIn January 2016, HomeBiogas expanded into the domestic sector, launching an Indiegogo campaign. The campaign reached its goal of $100,000 in the first 24 hours, eventually culminating in over $250,000 raised. These first commercial units shipped in May, 2016.\n\nThe HomeBiogas system generates biogas by anaerobically fermenting organic matter. Types of acceptable organic matter include meat, dairy, and animal manure, as well. The anaerobic digestion is achieved by bacteria living inside the system. As a result, HomeBiogas runs without electricity. \n\nAs of 2016, HomeBiogas can receive inputs of up to six liters per day of food waste, or up to 15 liters per day of animal manure. Each kilogram may produce 200 liters of biogas, enough fuel for an hour of cooking.\n\nAnnually, each HomeBiogas system may eliminate up to one ton of organic waste, and six tons of carbon dioxide.\n"}
{"id": "15525260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15525260", "title": "Human power", "text": "Human power\n\nHuman power is work or energy that is produced from the human body. It can also refer to the power (rate of work per time) of a human. Power comes primarily from muscles, but body heat is also used to do work like warming shelters, food, or other humans.\n\nWorld records of power performance by humans are of interest to work planners and work-process engineers. The average level of human power that can be maintained over a certain duration of time, say over the extent of one minute or one hour is interesting to engineers designing work operations in industry. Human power is occasionally used to generate and sometimes store electrical energy in batteries for use in the wilderness.\n\nNormal human metabolism produces heat at a basal metabolic rate of around 80 watts.\n\nDuring a bicycle race, an elite cyclist can produce close to 400 watts of mechanical power over an hour and in short bursts over double that — 1000 to 1100 watts; modern racing bicycles have greater than 95% mechanical efficiency. An adult of good fitness is more likely to average between 50 and 150 watts for an hour of vigorous exercise. Over an 8-hour work shift, an average, healthy, well-fed and motivated manual laborer may sustain an output of around 75 watts of work. However, the potential yield of human electric power is decreased by the inefficiency of any generator device, since all real generators incur considerable losses during the energy conversion process.\n\nWhile attempts have been made to fit electric generators to exercise equipment, the energy collected is of low value compared to the cost of the conversion equipment.\n\nSeveral forms of transport utilize human power. They include the bicycle, wheelchair, walking, skateboard, wheelbarrow, rowing, skis, and rickshaw. Some forms may utilize more than one person. The historical galley was propelled by freemen or citizens in ancient times, and by slaves captured by pirates in more recent times. The MacCready Gossamer Condor was the first human-powered aircraft capable of controlled and sustained flight, making its first flight in 1977. In 2007, Jason Lewis of Expedition 360 became the first person to circumnavigate the globe at non-polar latitudes using only human power — walking, biking, and rollerblading across the landmasses; and swimming, kayaking, rowing, and using a 26-foot-long pedal-powered boat to cross the oceans.\n\nSome equipment uses human power. It may directly use mechanical power from muscles, or a generator may convert energy generated by the body into electrical power.\n\"Human-powered equipment\" consists of electrical appliances which can be powered by electricity generated by human muscle power as an alternative to conventional sources of electricity such as disposable primary batteries and the electrical grid. Such devices contain electric generators or an induction system to recharge their batteries. Separate crank-operated generators are now available to recharge battery-powered portable electronic devices such as mobile phones. Others, such as mechanically powered flashlights, have the generator integrated within the device.\n\nAn alternative to rechargeable batteries for electricity storage is supercapacitors, now being used in some devices such as the mechanically powered flashlight shown here. Devices that store the energy mechanically, rather than electrically, include clockwork radios with a mainspring, which is wound up by a crank and turns a generator to power the radio.\n\nAn early example of regular use of human-powered electrical equipment is in early telephone systems; current to ring the remote bell was provided by a subscriber cranking a handle on the telephone, which turned a small magneto generator. Human-powered devices are useful as emergency equipment, when natural disaster, war, or civil disturbance make regular power supplies unavailable. They have also been seen as economical for use in poor countries, where batteries may be expensive and mains electricity unreliable or unavailable. They are also an environmentally preferable alternative to the use of disposable batteries, which are wasteful source of energy and may introduce heavy metals into the environment. Communication is a common application for the relatively small amount of electric power that can be generated by a human turning a generator.\n\nThe World War II-era Gibson girl survival radio used a hand-cranked generator to provide power; this avoided the unreliable performance of dry-cell batteries that might be stored for months before they were needed, although it had the drawback that the survivor had to be fit enough to turn the crank. Survival radios were invented and deployed by both sides during the war. The SCR-578 (and the similar post-war AN/CRT-3) survival radio transmitters carried by aircraft on over-water operations were given the nickname \"Gibson Girl\" because of their \"hourglass\" shape, which allowed them to be held stationary between the legs while the generator handle was turned.\n\nDuring World War II, U.S. troops sometimes employed hand crank generators, GN-35 and GN-45, to power Signal Corps Radio sets. The hand cranking was laborious, but generated sufficient current for smaller radio sets, such as the SCR-131, SCR-161, SCR-171, SCR-284, and SCR-694.\n\nA \"windup radio\" or \"clockwork radio\" is a radio that is powered by human muscle power rather than batteries or the electrical grid. In the most common arrangement, an internal electric generator is run by a mainspring, which is wound by a hand crank on the case. Turning the crank winds the spring and a full winding will allow several hours of operation. Alternatively, the generator can charge an internal battery.\n\nRadios powered by handcranked generators are not new, but their market was previously seen as limited to emergency or military organizations. The modern clockwork radio was designed and patented in 1991 by British inventor Trevor Baylis as a response to the HIV/AIDS crisis. He envisioned it as a radio for use by poor people in developing countries without access to batteries. In 1994, British accountant Chris Staines and his South African partner, Rory Stear, secured the worldwide license to the invention and cofounded Baygen Power Industries (now Freeplay Energy Ltd), which produced the first commercial model. The key to its design was the use of a constant velocity spring to store the potential energy, which are no longer in use. After Baylis lost control of his invention when Baygen became Freeplay, the Freeplay Energy units switched to disposable batteries charged by cheaper hand-crank generators.\n\nLike other self-powered equipment, windup radios were intended for camping, emergencies and for areas where there is no electrical grid and replacement batteries are hard to obtain, such as in developing countries or remote settlements. They are also useful where a radio is not used on a regular basis and batteries would deteriorate, such as at a vacation house or cabin.\n\nWindup radios designed for emergency use often included flashlights, blinking emergency lights, and emergency sirens. They also may include multiple alternate power sources, such as disposable or rechargeable batteries, Cigarette lighter receptacles, and solar cells.\n\nThe \"Pedal Radio\" (or \"Pedal Wireless\") was a radio transmitter-receiver powered by a pedal-driven generator. It was developed by Alfred Traeger in 1929 as a way of providing radio communications to remote homesteads in the Australian outback. There were no mains or generator power available at the time and batteries to provide the power required would have been too expensive. It is considered an important Australian invention.\n\n"}

The aggregate uses for the material include:\n\n\nAlternatively if there are no local markets for the IBA the material is typically disposed of in a landfill.\n\nIf IBA is used as the aggregate in foam concrete in non-ventilated areas, hydrogen gas deposits may build up during the lifespan of the material and explode when brought into contact with sources of ignition, such as during cutting with grinding equipment.

This is accomplished by performing energy audits or assessments at manufacturers near the particular center. The IAC program has achieved over $4.5 billion of implemented energy cost savings since its inception.\n\nIndustrial Assessment Centers (formerly called the Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Center (EADC) program) were created by the Department of Commerce in 1976 and later moved to the DOE. The IAC program is administered through the Advanced Manufacturing Office under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The Centers were created to help small and medium-sized manufacturing facilities cut back on unnecessary costs from inefficient energy use, ineffective production procedures, excess waste production, and other production-related problems. According to instructions from DOE, currently the centers are only required to focus on reducing wasted energy and increasing energy efficiency. While this remains the primary focus of the assessments, waste reduction and productivity improvements are still commonly recommended.\n\nIn addition to providing technical support to small to mid-sized manufacturers through energy assessments, the IAC program offers several other important benefits.

He is a former long-serving Member of Parliament for South Imenti constituency (1992-2013), former Cabinet Minister, and former Senator for Meru County.\n\nKiraitu Murungi was born on 1 January 1952 in Kionyo village, Abogeta division of Meru District in Eastern Kenya Daniel M’Mwarania and Anjelika Kiajia. He attended Chuka High School before proceeding to Alliance High School. Murungi graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Nairobi in 1977 and attained a Master of Law in the same university in 1982. He attained another Master in 1991 of Law from Harvard Law School where he served two years in exile in the United States at the heyday of Daniel arap Moi's one-party dictatorship.\n\nMurungi was a partner in a law firm he founded with Gibson Kamau Kuria and Aaron Ringera, where he practised law for ten years. His biggest case during this tenure was representing political prisoners of the Moi government including Wanyiri Kihoro against the government itself. A case that is mentioned severally in Wanyiri Kihoro's book \"Never Say Die: The Chronicle of a Political Prisoner\" and resulted in the detention of Kuria in an attempt to cause the abandonment of the case, as well as a period in exile in various western countries for both Mr Murungi and Mr. Kuria.\n\nUpon his return from exile, Kiraitu joined the struggle for multi-party democracy in 1990 as one of Kenya's \"Young Turks.\" Murungi joined the newly formed Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) following Kenya's return to multi-party politics in 1991. He was elected to parliament on a FORD ticket during the first multi-party election in 1992, serving as MP for parliament for South Imenti Constituency, Meru. Kiraitu decamped from FORD to Democratic Party (DP) when FORD splintered in the aftermath of the demise of its leader, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, retaining the South Imenti seat during the 1997 general elections. As an opposition member of parliament between 1991 and 2002, Kiraitu served as the shadow Attorney-General and member of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Anti-Corruption.\n\nMurungi has been a member of parliament since 1992 and has formerly served as Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and as the shadow Attorney General. In the 2002 Kenya General Elections he won the South Imenti Constituency MP seat for the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) party. After the Government's defeat in the 21 November 2005 constitutional referendum, he was appointed Minister of Energy. He was then reelected as a member of parliament under a Party of National Unity (PNU) ticket in the 2007 elections.\n\nOn 8 August 2017, he was elected the governor of Meru County under a Jubilee ticket, defeating the Incumbent Peter Munya an effectively becoming the second governor of the county since its inception. Prior to being the Governor Kiraitu served as the Senator for Meru County after winning the seat under the Alliance Party of Kenya (APK) ticket in the 2013 elections.\n\nHe is one of the closest allies of former Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki. He has been accused of attempting to cover-up in the Anglo Leasing Scandal, which he once claimed that it was a \"scandal that never was\". On 8 February 2006, the BBC World Service aired a conversation between Murungi and former Governance and Ethics Permanent Secretary John Githongo where he appears to be coercing Githongo to drop his investigations on the Anglo Leasing Scandal. He had promised that Anura Pereira would forgive a debt of KES 30 million owed by Githongo's father.\n\nMurungi initially maintained that he would not resign his cabinet post despite the allegations of corruption. He claimed that he was innocent and that Githongo's reports are mere propaganda. On the recording, he has commented: \"I have listened to the alleged tape recorded evidence. It is truncated, inaudible, insufficient and inadmissible to form any credible proof of the allegations being orchestrated by Mr Githongo\". On 13 February 2006, however, President Mwai Kibaki announced that Murungi had resigned to allow full investigation into the allegations. On 14 February 2006, a day after his resignation, Murungi has claimed that he played no role at all to cover-up the Anglo Leasing Scandal. He blamed his woes on the politics of National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) and the media. However, it later emerged that President Mwai Kibaki had asked him to resign from the government.\n\nOn 10 February 2006, Murungi issued a statement that was faxed to all Kenyan media houses questioning the intentions and motives of John Githongo, in the form of 36 questions. Among the questions he asked is why John Githongo was recording his conversations with government officials and whether he was a spy for foreign nations.\n\nOn 15 November 2006 he was reinstated as Energy Minister by Kibaki. He remained in that position in the Cabinet appointed by Kibaki on 8 January 2008, following the controversial December 2007 election.\n\nIn February 2005, Murungi apologised for making a remark which was criticised as trivialising both rape and corruption. He had said that criticism from aid donors of corruption in Kenya was \"like raping a woman who is already willing\".\n\n\n"}

In the Mesozoic era, Laramidia was an island land mass separated from Appalachia to the east by the Western Interior Seaway. The seaway eventually shrank, split across the Dakotas, and retreated towards the Gulf of Mexico and the Hudson Bay. The masses joined to unite the North American continent.\n\nLaramidia is named for Laramie, Wyoming, located in the former landmass. The name was coined by J. David Archibald in 1996.\n\nLaramidia stretches from modern-day Alaska to Mexico. The area is rich in dinosaur fossils. Tyrannosaurs, dromaeosaurids, troodontids, hadrosaurs, ceratopsians (including \"Kosmoceratops\" and \"Utahceratops\"), pachycephalosaurs, and titanosaur sauropods are some of the dinosaur groups that lived on this landmass.\n\nVertebrate fossils have been found in the region from Alaska to Coahuila.\n\nFrom the Turonian age of the Late Cretaceous to the very beginning of the Paleocene, Laramidia was separated from Appalachia to the east. As a result, the fauna evolved differently on each land mass over that time. Geological conditions were generally favorable for the preservation of fossils in Laramidia, making the western United States one of the most productive fossil regions in the world. Less is known about Appalachian biodiversity in the Cretaceous as few fossiliferous deposits exist in the region today and half of the fossil beds in Appalachia were destroyed during the Pleistocene ice age. However, fossil beds which haven't been discovered yet could exist in areas of the former Appalachian continent.\n\nIn western North America during the Cretaceous the dominant theropods were the tyrannosaurs, huge predatory dinosaurs with proportionately massive heads built for ripping flesh from their prey. In Laramidia there were the theropods of Tyrannosaurinae such as \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", \"Nanuqsaurus hoglundi\", \"Daspletosaurus\", \"Teratophoneus\", and theropods of Albertosaurinae such as \"Albertosaurus\" and \"Gorgosaurus\", all being included under the same family of Tyrannosauridae and not all contemporary. The bodies of tyrannosaurs exhibited huge heads and legs, in contrast to proportionally tiny arms. The teeth exhibited in this family are rather comparable to railroad spikes and would have helped inflict major damage on prey.\n\nAnother common group of North American dinosaurs were the hadrosaurs. The fossil record shows a staggering variety of hadrosaur forms in Laramidia.\n\nOther differences in genera appear between the island land masses. Sauropods roamed Laramidia during the Cretaceous after apparently dying out in Appalachia. Nodosaurs, though, appear to have been more plentiful in Appalachia. Nodosaurs were large, herbivorous armored dinosaurs resembling armadillos. They were scarce in Laramidia by the late Cretaceous, existing only in specialized forms like \"Edmontonia\" and \"Panoplosaurus\" while nodosaurs were thriving in Appalachia.\n"}

The NFW profile is one of the most commonly used model profiles for dark matter halos.\n\nIn the NFW profile, the density of dark matter as a function of radius is given by:\n\nwhere \"ρ\" and the \"scale radius\", \"R\", are parameters which vary from halo to halo.\n\nThe integrated mass within some radius \"R\" is\n\nThe total mass is divergent, but it is often useful to take the edge of the halo to be the virial radius, \"R\", which is related to the \"concentration parameter\", \"c\", and scale radius via\n\nThe virial radius is often referred to as formula_4, and is defined as the radius at which the average density within this radius is 200 times the critical density. In this case, the total mass in the halo within formula_5 is\n\nThe value of \"c\" is roughly 10 or 15 for the Milky Way, and may range from 4 to 40\nfor halos of various sizes.\n\nThe integral of the \"squared density\" is\n\nso that the mean squared density inside of \"R\" is\n\nwhich for the virial radius simplifies to\n\nand the mean squared density inside the scale radius is simply\n\nSolving Poisson's equation gives the gravitational potential\nwith the limits formula_12 and formula_13 .\n\nThe radius of the maximum circular velocity (confusingly sometimes also referred to as formula_14) can be found from the maximum of formula_15 as\nwhere formula_17 is the positive root of \n\nOver a broad range of halo mass and redshift, the NFW profile approximates the equilibrium configuration of dark matter halos produced in simulations of collisionless dark matter particles by numerous groups of scientists. Before the dark matter virializes, the distribution of dark matter deviates from an NFW profile, and significant substructure is observed in simulations both during and after the collapse of the halos.\n\nAlternative models, in particular the Einasto profile, have been shown to represent the dark matter profiles of simulated halos as well as or better than the NFW profile by including an additional third parameter. The Einasto profile has a finite (zero) central slope, unlike the NFW profile which has a divergent (infinite) central density. Because of the limited resolution of N-body simulations, it is not yet known which model provides the best description of the central densities of simulated dark-matter halos.\n\nSimulations assuming different cosmological initial conditions produce halo populations in which the two parameters of the NFW profile follow different mass-concentration relations, depending on cosmological properties such as the density of the universe and the nature of the very early process which created all structure. Observational measurements of this relation thus offer a route to constraining these properties.\n\nThe dark matter density profiles of massive galaxy clusters can be measured directly by gravitational lensing and agree well with the NFW profiles predicted for cosmologies with the parameters inferred from other data. For lower mass halos, gravitational lensing is too noisy to give useful results for individual objects, but accurate measurements can still be made by averaging the profiles of many similar systems. For the main body of the halos, the agreement with the predictions remains good down to halo masses as small as those of the halos surrounding isolated galaxies like our own. The inner regions of halos are beyond the reach of lensing measurements, however, and other techniques give results which disagree with NFW predictions for the dark matter distribution inside \nthe visible galaxies which lie at halo centers.\n\nObservations of the inner regions of bright galaxies like the Milky Way and M31 may be compatible with the NFW profile, but this is open to debate. The NFW dark matter profile is not consistent with observations of the inner regions of low surface brightness galaxies, which have less central mass than predicted. This is known as the cusp-core or cuspy halo problem.\nIt is currently debated whether this discrepancy is a consequence of the nature of the dark matter, of the influence of dynamical processes during galaxy formation, or of shortcomings in dynamical modelling of the observational data.\n\n"}

When skillfully performed, this eases the analysis of the problem which is at study, and reduces the number of free parameters. Small or large sizes of certain dimensionless parameters indicate the importance of certain terms in the equations for the studied flow. This may provide possibilities to neglect terms in certain (areas of the) considered flow. Further, non-dimensionalized Navier–Stokes equations can be beneficial if one is posed with similar physical situations – that is problems where the only changes are those of the basic dimensions of the system.\n\nScaling of Navier–Stokes equation refers to the process of selecting the proper spatial scales – for a certain type of flow – to be used in the non-dimensionalization of the equation. Since the resulting equations need to be dimensionless, a suitable combination of parameters and constants of the equations and flow (domain) characteristics have to be found. As a result of this combination, the number of parameters to be analyzed is reduced and the results may be obtained in terms of the scaled variables.\n\nIn addition to reducing the number of parameters, non-dimensionalized equation helps to gain a greater insight into the relative size of various terms present in the equation.\nFollowing appropriate selecting of scales for the non-dimensionalization process, this leads to identification of small terms in the equation. Neglecting the smaller terms against the bigger ones allows for the simplification of the situation. For the case of flow without heat transfer, the non-dimensionalized Navier–Stokes equation depend only on the Reynolds Number and hence all physical realizations of the related experiment will have the same value of non-dimensionalized variables for the same Reynolds Number.\n\nScaling helps provide better understanding of the physical situation, with the variation in dimensions of the parameters involved in the equation. This allows for experiments to be conducted on smaller scale prototypes provided that any physical effects which are not included in the non-dimensionalized equation are unimportant.\n\nThe incompressible Navier–Stokes momentum equation is written as:\n\nwhere ρ is the density, \"p\" is the pressure, ν is the kinematic viscosity, u is the flow velocity, and g is the body acceleration field.\n\nThe above equation can be non-dimensionalized through selection of appropriate scales as follows:\n\nSubstituting the scales the non-dimensionalized equation obtained is:\n\nwhere \"Fr\" is the Froude number and \"Re\" is the Reynolds number.\n\nFor flows where viscous forces are dominant i.e. slow flows with large viscosity, a viscous pressure scale μ\"U\"/\"L\" is used. In the absence of a free surface, the equation obtained is\n\nScaling of equation () can be done, in a flow where inertia term is smaller than the viscous term i.e. when Re → 0 then inertia terms can be neglected, leaving the equation of a creeping motion.\n\nSuch flows tend to have influence of viscous interaction over large distances from an object. At low Reynolds number the same equation reduces to a diffusion equation, named Stokes equation\n\nSimilarly if Re → ∞ i.e. when the inertia forces dominates, the viscous force can be neglected by substituting μ = 0 in the equation.The non-dimensionalized Euler equation for an inviscid flow is\n\nDensity variation due to both concentration and temperature is an important field of study in Double diffusive convection\"If density changes due to both temperature and salinity is taken into account then some more terms add to the Z-Component of momentum as follows:\n\nWhere \"S\" is the salinity of the fluid, β is the thermal expansion coefficient at constant pressure and β is the coefficient of saline expansion at constant pressure and temperature.\n\nNon dimensionalizing using the scale:\nwe get\n\nwhere \"S\", \"T\" denote the salinity and temperature at top layer, \"S\", \"T\" denote the salinity and temperature at bottom layer, Ra is the Rayleigh Number, and Pr is the Prandtl Number.

Analogous to business analytics – massive mathematical models and algorithms used to predict financial behavior and potential risks – in power infrastructure model-validated analytics use the data in the original CAD model of an electrical power system to assess the impending likelihood of a short circuit, arc flash, or other power engineering problems.\n\nModel-validated analytics can also optimize power consumption energy conservation in mission-critical facilities by ensuring – like the engine management system in an automobile engine – that every component is operating within its as-designed operating specifications. This component-by-component calibration results in what is effectively a 24/7, system-wide tune-up, that occurs every millisecond. Thus they play a vital role in help organizations minimize their carbon footprint and work toward a carbon-neutral footprint.\n\nThe trademark for \"Power Analytics\" was awarded to Power Analytics Corporation in 2006.\n\nModel-validated analytics are used in mission-critical facilities (those requiring 99.9% uptime or better) marked by very dense electrical power usage, and where operational reliability is paramount. Facilities who are candidates for employing power analytics include transaction-intensive data centers, government and military installations, offshore oil platforms, air traffic control hubs, hospitals, casinos, and electric power generation and power transmission networks. In such facilities, electrical power problems can have very costly consequences, costing millions of dollars (U.S.) per minutes.\n\nModel-validated analytics employ and integrate three primary sources of power-related data:\n\n\nOnce the system is deployed, the three software platforms interoperate with one another. If there are no deviations between the “as-is” and “as-designed,” specifications, no actions are taken. However, the instant any “as-is” value begin to drift from the corresponding value specified in the CAD model, however slightly, the diagnostics engine immediately begins to isolate the deviation, assess its implications, devise a remedy, and alert the facility operator to the problem and its resolution. Because noticeable electrical power problems are frequently the result of minute anomalies that went undetected – and thus, worsened over time – model-validated analytics are recognized as a very effective technology for preempting serious power faults before they can pose a threat to the operational effectiveness of a facility.\n"}

However this is misleading, as \"selena\" indicates that selenium substitutes for a carbon atom, but actually selenium is substituted for the oxygen atom in pyrylium. In the Hantzsch-Widman system it is called seleninium. This is the name used by Chemical Abstracts. Replacement nomenclature would call this selenoniabenzene.\n\nNumbering in selenopyrylium starts with 1 on the selenium atom and counts up to 6 counter-clockwise on the carbon atoms. The positions adjacent to the chalcogen, numbered 2 and 6 can also be called α, the next two positions 3 and 5 can be termed \"β\" and the opposite carbon at position 4 can be called \"γ\".\n\nBecause selenopyrylium is a positively charged cation, it takes the solid form as a salt with non-nucleophillic anions like perchlorate, tetrafluoroborate, fluorosulfate, or hexafluorophosphate.\n\nSelenopyrylium and derivatives can be made from 1,5-diketones (glutaraldehyde), hydrogen selenide along with HCl as a catalyst in acetic acid solvent. A side product is 2,6-bis-(hydroseleno)selenacyclohexane.\n\nWhen 5-chloro-2,4-pentadienenitrile derivatives react with soidum hydroselenide, or sodium selenite, and is then treated with perchloric acid, a 2-amino-selenopyrilium perchlorate salt results.\n\nThe positive charge is not confined to the selenium atom, but distributes on the ring in several resonance structures, so that the α and γ positions have some positive charge. A nucleophillic attack targets these carbon atoms.\n\nSelenopyrylium has two prominent absorption bands in the ultraviolet spectrum, band I is at 3000 Å, and band II is at 2670 Å. Band I, also known as \"L\" is from the \"B\"←\"A\" transition. The wavelength is longer and the band is much stronger than that of benzene. This is a bathochromic shift. The wavelength is longer than in thiopyrylium and pyrylium, but the intensity is weaker, due to selenium being less electronegative. Band II, also called \"L\", is stronger and longer than that of benzene, thiopyrylium and pyrylium. Band II is polarized in the direction of Se-γ axis.\n\nThe nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum shows a 10.98 ppm shift for H2 and 6, 8.77 for H3 and H5 and 9.03 for H4 (BF salt dissolved in CDCN). Compared to other pyryliums H2,6 is more than that of oxygen or sulfur, H3,5 is between that of oxygen and sulfur, and H4 is very similar to thiopyrylium, but is slightly lower.

Due to which the fluid with lower density is always above the fluid with higher density. Stratified flows are very common such as the Earth's ocean and its atmosphere.\n\nA stratified fluid may be defined as the fluid with density variations in the vertical direction. For example, air and water; both are fluids and if we consider them together then they can be seen as a stratified fluid system. Density variations in the atmosphere profoundly affect the motion of water and air. Wave phenomena in air flow over the mountains and occurrence of smog are the examples of stratification effect in the atmosphere.\nWhen a fluid system having a condition in which fluid density decreases with height, is disturbed, then the gravity and friction restore the undisturbed conditions. If however the fluid tends to be stable if density decreases with height.\n\nIt is known that the sub critical flow of a stratified fluid past a barrier produce motions upstream of the barrier. Sub critical flow may be defined as a flow for which the Froude number based on channel height is less than 1/π, so that one\nor more stationary lee waves would be present. Some of the upstream motions do not decompose with the distance upstream. These ‘columnar’ modes have zero frequency and a sinusoidal structure in the direction of the density gradient; they effectively lead to a continuous change in upstream conditions. If the barrier is two-dimensional (i.e. of infinite extent in the direction perpendicular to the upstream flow and the direction of density gradient), inviscid theories show that the length of the upstream\nregion affected by the columnar modes increases without bound as t->infinity. Non-zero viscosity (and/or diffusivity) will, however, limit the region affected, since the wave amplitudes will then slowly decay.\n\nTurbulent mixing in stratified flows is described by mixing efficiency. This mixing efficiency compares the energy used in irreversible mixing, enlarging the minimum gravitational potential energy that can be kept in the density field, to the\nentire change in mechanical energy during the mixing process. It can be defined either as an integral quantity, calculated between inert initial and final conditions or as a fraction of the energy flux to mixing and the power into the system. These two definitions can give different values if the system is not in steady state. Mixing efficiency is especially important in oceanography as mixing is required to keep the overall stratification in a steady-state ocean. The entire amount of mixing in the oceans is equal to the product of the power input to the ocean and the mean mixing efficiency.\n\nWallis and Dobson (1973) estimate their criterion with transition observations that they call “Slugging” and note that empirically the stability limit is described by\n\nHere\nformula_2 and \nformula_3 \nwhere H is channel height and U, h and ρ denote the mean velocity, holdup and density respectively. The subscripts G and L stand for gas and liquid and g denotes Gravity.\nTaitel and Dukler (1976) [TD] expanded the (Kelvin and helmholtz) KH analysis first to the case of a finite wave on a flat liquid sheet in horizontal channel flow and then to finite waves on stratified liquid in an Inclined pipe. In order to apply this criterion they need to provide the equilibrium liquid level hL (or liquid holdup). They calculate \nformula_4through momentum balances in the gas and liquid phases (two fluid models) in which shear stresses are examine and assessed using conventional friction factors definitions. In two fluid models, the pipe geometry is taken into consideration through wetted perimeters by the gas and liquid phases, including the gas-liquid interface. This states that the wall resistance of the liquid is similar to that for open-channel flow and that of the gas to close-duct flow. This geometry analysis is general and could be applied not only to round pipes, but to any other possible shape. In this method, each pair of superficial gas and liquid velocity relates to a distinctive value of\nformula_4\n. According to [TD], a finite wave will grow in a horizontal rectangular channel of height H, when\nor\nfor inclined pipe. D is the pipe diameter and A is the cross section area.\nNote that\nformula_8.\nIf\nformula_9\nformula_10\n, and this is compatible with the result of Wallis and Dobson(1973) The [TD] overall procedure result to a weak dependence on viscosity, through the calculation of\nformula_4.\n[TD] also identify two kinds of stratified flow: stratified smooth (SS) and stratified wavy (SW). These waves, as they say, “are produced by the gas flow under conditions where the velocity of gas is enough to cause waves to form, but slower than that needed for the quick wave growth which leads transition to intermittent or annular flow.” [TD] suggest a standard to predict the transition from stratified smooth to stratified wavy flow, based on Jeffreys’ (1925, 1926) ideas.\n\nDensity stratification has significant effect on diffusion in fluids. For example, smoke which is coming from a chimney diffuses turbulently if the earth atmosphere is not stably stratified. When the lower air is in stable condition, as in morning or early evening, the smoke comes out and become flat into a long, thin layer. Strong stratification, or inversions as they are called sometimes, restrict contaminants to the lower regions of the earth atmosphere, and cause many of our current air-pollution problems.\n\n"}

{"id": "9169055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9169055", "title": "Wooden toy train", "text": "Wooden toy train\n\nWooden toy trains are toy trains that run on a wooden track system with grooves to guide the wheels of the rolling stock. While the trains, tracks and scenery accessories are made mainly of wood, the engines and cars connect to each other using metal hooks or small magnets, and some use plastic wheels mounted on metal axles. Some trains are made to resemble anthropomorphical, fictional, and prototypical railroad equipment.\n\nMarshal H. Larrabee II founded the Skaneateles Handicrafters in 1936. This toy company made wooden toy trains and wooden tracks. The gauge was very similar to that used by most companies today. However, the connections for the track pieces were of a different design than the jigsaw style \"peg and hole\" system used today. The trains were made of maple and were often left unpainted and unstained. They are compatible with many brands of modern wooden train track. Playskool took over the sales for Skaneateles Handicrafters in 1956. This company retained the design and track connecting system into the 1960s. Marshal H. Larrabee sold his company to the German-based Habermaaß GmbH in 1980. The company was renamed T.C. Timber and its products were manufactured in Skaneateles. The production line was closed in 2002.\n\nThe Jack-Built Toy Manufacturing Company marketed its own range of wooden toy trains under the brand name \"Jack Built Snap Trains\" around 1956 to 1962. These were manufactured in Japan and used a snap system to join pieces of rolling stock and tracks. Rolling stock from Jack Built Snap Trains and Skaneateles Handicrafters could ride on either manufacturer's tracks. However, individual pieces of rolling stock and track from the two brands could not be combined. This is because the coupling systems for the tracks and trains were different.\n\nCalifornia-based Ben Orel filed U.S. patent #2847798 in 1956 and was granted the patent for his \"snap coupling\" system two years later. He describes how the track could be rotated to create a \"rail\" and a \"road\" side in U.S. patent #3013726 submitted in 1960 and granted in 1961. This is similar to the idea that Learning Curve later used for their \"Thomas & Friends\" range. He also submitted a patent for magnetic couplings in 1958. This patent was granted in 1960. It may have been the earliest attempt to use magnets with a wooden toy train system. Production stopped in the mid-1960s and the company disappeared from the toy market.\n\nIn 1957, BRIO, based in Osby in southern Sweden, introduced its wooden toy train system with wooden tracks in Europe. It may have been the first company to use the \"peg and hole\" system to connect the track pieces in mass production. The metal hook system for the rolling stock has since been replaced by magnetic connectors. BRIO was also one of the first companies to use beechwood for such products.\n\nAnother Swedish company that started producing a similar toy at about this time was Micki Leksaker in Gemla. It apparently produced its first wooden train sets for a Swedish department store in 1956, thus predating Brio by a year or two.\n\nThere was a long tradition of wooden toy-making along the mountain forests surrounding Bohemia. Seiffen made wooden figures and Christmas decorations and Blumenau (today a part of Olbernhau) created building blocks and construction sets. Mass production techniques for polishing and coloring wooden toys were established and perfected in the Bohemian areas. Some of the early sets exhibited train designs that were later used for wooden track trains. In 1949, Hermann Eichhorn, of the Eichhorn family that made the PEWESTI wooden toys in Steinach, Thuringia, founded his company for wooden toys in the Bavarian town of Egglham. In 1961, he started producing his version of a wooden track railway system. Eichhorn claims that his company is the first to have systematically used the \"vario system\" for the connectors. Eichhorn applied for a U.S. patent for a \"battery powered toy train\" in 1994. In 1997 the company had to be sold to the Simba-Dickie-Group, which moved production to Unhošť, near Prague in the Czech Republic. By 1998 the company was fully integrated into the Simba-Dickie-Group. In February 1999 two fires totally destroyed the old factory buildings in Egglham and consumed most of the company's archives and work models.\n\nHeros (He+ros), the company of Hermann Rossberg of Lam in the Bavarian Forest near to the border of Bohemia, influenced train design in the Blumenau tradition. He too started a line of wooden trains in 1968 to the same gauge, using bright colors in his train designs. In the 1970s the company experimented with plastic tracks based on the peg and hole design of the wooden tracks, but soon returned to normal wooden tracks. In 2010 the company had to be sold to the Simba-Dickie-Group. The train lines where dropped and the focus shifted to wooden toy blocks and the constructor toy range while Eichhorn became the only supplier of toy trains on a wooden track system within the Simba-Dickie-Group.\n\n\"Thomas the Tank Engine\" is a character created by the Rev. W. Awdry in \"The Railway Series\" of children's books, first published in the U.K. in 1945. In 1984 a television series called \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\" was made, adding to the popularity of the characters. It was first broadcast in the United States in 1989. John W. Lee founded the company \"Learning Curve Toys\" in November 1992 with a wooden railway system called \"Thomas & Friends\" based on the Thomas the Tank Engine characters. This made the wooden toy trains even more popular than before. Learning Curve introduced some new designs for the track surface, such as the \"Clickety Clack\" rails patented 1995 and the newer tracks in 2002 with a relief to supply better traction grip for battery powered four wheel drive trains patented in 1998.\n\nWith the popularity of the toy system rising due to the success of \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\", new markets outside of the traditional groups and countries were opened. While companies such as Mapple Landmark adjusted its existing line of \"Name Trains\" to the gauge of the vario system in 1993, others such as Whittle Shortline, established in 1997, started producing rolling stock based on the more realistic designs of existing American examples. While Brio and \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\" clearly favoured the steam engine era, Whittle Shortline expanded into heavy duty diesel engines of designs hardly known in Europe. In the product line \"Trains of the World\" shown in the Brio catalog of 1998, Brio presents several historic steam engines, such as the Mallard or the Flying Scotsman along with several modern high speed trains such as the Shinkansen, TGV or ICE. The only diesel unit is from the Santa Fe line. Another project based on real-life prototypes is the \"New York City Subway Wooden Railway\" by the company named \"Munipals\".\n\nOther companies, such as Nilo and KidKraft, concentrated on related items like train tables, among other products. Suretrack sells its track securing clips, and Choo Choo Track & Toy Co., founded in 1999, has concentrated on producing and designing tracks and accessories.\n\nAlthough the original push-along trains made mostly of wood still resemble the core idea of this system toy and as of 2006 form the base of all the involved companies' production lines, electronics have gained access to the wooden world. After introducing battery powered engines in the 1990s, remote control had been added by 2002, and so-called smart tracks introduced plastic parts to the wooden track pieces. In 2006 Brio even introduced a theme resembling electronic networking with some electronic gadgets. Altogether this has led to some new track designs allowing better traction for the self powered trains or means of communication between the tracks and trains using some magnetic or electronic gadget.\n\nAs with other toys, many wooden trains and track have been manufactured in China and other Asian countries in the twenty-first century. The lead paint problems of 2007 brought this to public awareness. Manufacturing in Asia goes back a lot further though: already in the 1950s the Snap-Trains of Ben Orel were made in Japan.\n\nProbably the first major brand that was manufactured in China was the Chicago-based \"Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway\". Some of the design, such as the character faces and the spoked wheels, have stayed unique to the brand while other attributes, such as the modular build of the units with a rectangular single block chassis holding the wheels and individual buildup on top, have become widespread designs in China and elsewhere. Another major brand is Maxim. Starting with traditional rather plain and abstract designs, Maxim sold products under the name \"Tumble Tree Wood\" for retail stores. They have since adopted their current design with a winged number on their rolling stock. The main supplier is a factory in Dong Guan, China. The trains with the winged numbers are also sold by other brands such as Babalu in Germany. In 2004, Brio of Sweden moved most of their production to three factories in Guangdong Province, China. A more recent brand is Melissa & Doug that is also produced in China. Smaller projects were the short-lived ventures of Remus and Europlay.\n\nA producer that has sold its products under very many brands including its own name is Mentari Massen, with its main factory founded in 1988 in Surabaya, Indonesia. Their items have been sold as sets or individually bundled under such brand names as elile, FunToys, Toytopia, The Toy Company, Bino, Snap on Tools and Bigjigs, as well as Mentari Toys or Mentari Group.\n\nA quite prolific producer with its own clear design is Plantoys of Thailand. They have been making children's toys and furniture from rubber wood, which has since been adopted by other companies. They have a range of car and city related sets that could be used as accessories for the wooden toy train ranges of other producers. They had a joint venture with Brio in 2001–2002, being present in the Brio catalogs of the time. By 2007 they had started their own line of wooden trains, expanding it in 2008.\n\nIn 1985, Bigjigs Toys Ltd started out by selling a large range of wooden jigsaws. Then in the 1990s they moved into the wooden railway market with a small core range of wooden railway system items. In 2007 they re-launched their railway range under the brand Bigjigs Rail, in new blue sky and green hills packaging. There are, as of 2012, over 130 pieces in the Bigjigs Rail range including sets, track and a range of real life engines such as Mallard, Duchess of Hamilton and Bluebell.\n\nAlthough the products of many companies are quite compatible with each other they may vary in make, the wood used and some basic measurements. Popular woods used and advertised thus are beech, maple and rubber tree.\n\nTrack grooves are 3 mm deep, 5 mm wide and have 20 mm between them. The tracks themselves are 40 mm wide and 12 mm high. To be kept on track the system can be reduced to a shallow groove 30 mm wide, as in some road systems or small ramps that allow the vehicle to get on or off the track from the floor, or to a middle section 20 mm wide and 3 mm high, as in some beginners tracks or double track road systems. Most modern track systems have a somewhat sophisticated profile with varying degrees of slanted sides for the grooves or rounded edges. In the imperial system the tracks have been described as having grooves an eighth of an inch deep, a quarter of an inch wide and with three quarters of an inch between them. The tracks themselves are one and a half inches wide and half an inch high. However, unlike other model railroading gauges, which have been formally defined by enthusiast groups such as the National Model Railroad Association or the Normen Europäischer Modellbahnen, there is no agreed gauge for wooden trains. The actual cross sectional profile of any given manufacturer's track is usually patented, compelling new manufacturers to alter their track design enough to allow compatibility with other brands without committing patent infringement.\n\nSome track pieces such as curves and points have grooves on both sides so that they can be used from both sides. By flipping the piece around one can convert a left-hand curve or point to a right-handed one. Another possibility is to have the two grooves for trains on the one side and the single wide groove for roads on the other side. Ben Orel describes such a system in U.S. patent #3013726, which he submitted in 1960. Learning Curve made such tracks for their \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" theme.\n\nWhen trying to document a layout with exact geometry one quickly notices that a lot of layouts one builds with real track do not work using a CAD system or some track layout program. This is due to the so-called \"vario system\" which allows some play when joining the tracks, so that with some wiggling around one can make layouts line up perfectly with no danger of derailing trains which do not use the exact geometry of the pieces. This is achieved by making the pegs somewhat smaller than the holes. Sometimes the round part of the hole is not an exact circle but rather an ellipse, allowing the tracks to connect with a small gap between them. Also, the neck gap does not have a sharp edge at the end of the track, but is carved round. This may have started as a production loss or to make it easier for small children to join the tracks. Some sources state that Eichhorn was the first to design connections using this system.\n\nThough not all manufacturers use the same system for their track piece designs some principle standards have evolved, as the geometry involved with track systems tends to pose the same problems to everyone. The first question may be how to divide the circle. The standard for wooden tracks is eight pieces. The next important length is the diameter of the circle made of a line along the center of the tracks. This length is useful for figures such as an eight with the crossing at right angles, a simple L-figure, a bulge to one side or a spectacles or Mickey Mouse head, to name the simplest.\n\nA division in two gives a handy piece of straight track. For the figure eight one could use two straight pieces to go underneath and a bridge made to the same length to cross over the other straights. If one wants a crossing on the same level, the diameter can be divided by three and a crossing piece made with straights of that length. Of course one can also produce pieces of a quarter diameter length to put to the left and right of a central bridge piece that is half the length of the diameter. As one can see, it is useful to determine the length of the straight tracks by dividing the diameter of the circle made by the curves. Brio uses lengths of half, quarter and eighth as well as a third and sixth.\n\nTo solve problems of offset produced by points that branch out at the same angle producing parallel tracks, it is also useful to design such points and switches so that one of the short straights can compensate the offset. An easy way to design points is by tracing a long and a curved track to the same piece using the same connecting point as the origin. Such a merged piece can thus serve as a curve for one branch and a straight for the other while using the same dimensions as the other pieces.\n\nSeveral approaches have been made over time to add a road system to the railway tracks. The first and still most widely used level crossings use simple ramps that enable vehicles to cross the thick tracks from whatever underground the tracks are placed on. The simplest way to add roads to this existing solution is to provide a layout printed on a paper or plastic sheet or even a carpet that uses the dimensions of the wooden tracks. Some companies have made thin track pieces out of plastic or other materials that can be joined by some connecting system and have special crossover pieces to allow playing together with a wooden railway system. The next step seems to have been road track pieces of similar thickness as the railway tracks but using some other connecting design. Using the same \"peg and hole\" system as the railway tracks seems to have come later. The \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" theme from Learning Curve used track pieces that had the traditional railway design on one side and a new road design on the other using a design invented by Ben Orel in 1960. These roads had the same profile and measurements as the railway tracks, except that the part between the grooves was missing so that the road was a broad \"groove\" with sidings or curbs. The road vehicles and the railway rolling stock could be used interchangeable on both systems. Brio had introduced a track with wider grooves that was used for trains aimed at a younger age group. These used the same connection system as the other tracks and had the same distance between the grooves. This made it possible for the normal trains to run on the wider tracks. When these wide grooves have the same width as the \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" road pieces they can be used as a two way road. Other companies have since adopted this system.\n\nEarly sets such as of Skaneateles, Eichhorn and Brio all seem to have used rather simple and abstract designs. The pieces were not painted, so that trains and tracks had the same surface. The normal early trains had engines and wagons each carved from a single piece of wood and connected by hooks and eyes. Painted sets may have become common in the early 1970s, as did the use of magnets as connectors. Engines carved from a single block were commonly painted black in Europe with bright red funnels and wheels. The early trains made with construction sets and large pull-along trains may have influenced other early train designs that were built of several wood pieces (\"cut broomstick design\" among others). Normally each wooden piece had its own color, thus an engine, for example, could sport six different colors: one each for the base plate, the cylindrical boiler, the drivers cabin, the cabin roof, the funnels and the wheels. Sets with painted patterns seem to have become more popular in the late 1980s and 1990s. This may have been due to the success of the \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" series and the wish for more realistic real world designs.\n\nAs of 2007 there seem to be several design trends:\n\nTrain tables are a popular way to set up trains and railways, with fixed versions often placed in waiting rooms at hospitals, doctors' offices, or other places where some entertainment for children may be offered. This way they stay off the ground and it is not necessary to take apart the track after it is built! Wooden railway layouts based on the wTrak module standard have become part of model railroad shows in the United States - starting in the Pacific Northwest in 2009.\n\nEarly Skaneateles sets had rectangular supports that raised the track gradually. Due to the different connection system Skaneateles used at that time, tracks could be easily bent upwards at the connection point. The two-piece bridge with massive, self-supporting, ramps has been common since the 1960s. Provided with supports, this bridge could be easily elongated using normal straights. More modern bridge designs have used large amounts of plastic since the 1980s, reducing the amount of wood needed and thus producing lighter and cheaper designs. A sturdy basic bridge is the three-part bridge with the connections in the ramp section. Such designs seem to be aimed at the youngest players as they do not come apart easily. However, the design is not extendable. The two part bridge led to the development of some raised track pieces. First versions had viaduct-like designs or sported some sort of gadget like a drawbridge. Later ramps were track bent in an S-shape. As these were not self-supporting, new sorts of elevated track pieces were introduced. These consisted of a short piece of track raised by four legs. These supports were stackable and based on a square design, so that the direction could be changed by a right angle turn on the different levels.\n\nEarly buildings had windows and doors made by drawing lines in a single color on simple rectangular blocks. Sometimes they had slanted roofs made with another piece of wood, painted another color, stacked on top. A common early station design consisted of a simple platform with a roof on two or three supports along the longer axis. Later buildings have printed multicolor patterns. There have always been building sets that were similar to the popular wooden building blocks, allowing lots of individual designs. Since the 1990s building designs have become more sophisticated and interaction with the trains has increased. Learning Curve may have made this approach popular with many designs based on the story plots of the \"Thomas the Tank\" series, such as a grain loader accessory or a logging mill.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has organized this task by delegation to its subsidiaries, the energy generating company Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) and the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC). Other subsidiaries are investment branch ZESA Enterprises (ZENT) and internet provider PowerTel Communications (Pvt) ltd. ZESA is the only electricity generator and supplier for the public grid. For many years the company has failed to produce enough energy to meet demands. ZESA produced an estimated 8.89 bill kWh in 2007, while demand was estimated to 10.89 kWh. ZESA represents Zimbabwe in the Southern African Power Pool.\n\nIn general the power generation capacity in Zimbabwe is too small to meet demand from the industry and private householdings. Import of electricity from surrounding countries has eased the situation somewhat, but load shedding is used on a routine basis and some rural areas do not have electricity over long periods. Zimbabwe’s difficult economic situation causes part of the problems, as coal for power stations may at times not be produced in sufficient amounts. On the other hand, the economy is hampered by the unforeseeable energy situation. Recently the revival of the economy has increased demand.\n\nZESA owns the Kariba Power Station together with its Zambian counterpart, ZESCO. The station is part of the Kariba Dam project, damming the Zambezi river. The Zimbawean-owned capacity is said to be around 750 MW. ZESA also owns four thermal power stations, of which Hwange Thermal Power Station in the extreme west of the country is by far the largest with a theoretical capacity of about 920 MW. The other three at Harare, Bulawayo and Munyati have a nominal capacity of 270 MW together. In the last years the thermal power stations have only been producing part or no electricity due to coal shortages and maintenance neglect. Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) and Namibias NamPower have in 2009 made agreements to help ZESA to revive the capacity in exchange for power deliveries. Work on Hwange has led to a better situation and the three minor stations are scheduled to be revived in the first quarter of 2011. In December 2015 China agreed to provide a $1.2 billion loan to add 600 MW of generating capacity to the Hwange station.\n\n\nBesides plans to upgrade both the Hwange plant and the Kariba dam facility, two new plants are projected, however funding is not secured. \n\n\n"}
