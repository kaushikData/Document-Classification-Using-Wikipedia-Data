It occurred due to the extratropical remnants of an Atlantic hurricane. The storm was the third tropical cyclone and first hurricane of the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season, and developed from a tropical wave in the central Gulf of Mexico on June 18. It headed rapidly northeastward and struck Florida later that day. Shortly after entering the Atlantic Ocean, it strengthened into a tropical storm later on June 18. By the following day, it had strengthened into a hurricane. However, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about six hours later. The remnants struck Atlantic Canada, once in Nova Scotia and again in Newfoundland before dissipating on June 21.\n\nIn its early stages, the storm dropped moderately heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. A tornado near Miami and high tides on the west coast of the state also resulted in damage. Overall, losses in Florida were around $1.7 million (1959 USD). After becoming extratropical, the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada. About 45 boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they did not have radio to receive warning of the approaching storm. Rough seas of up to 49 ft (15 m) in height damaged or destroyed many boats. At least 22 fishing boats capsized over water with their crew, causing 35 fatalities. High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses were damaged, causing $750,000 (1959 CAD, $781,000 1959 USD). The event became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick.\n\nOn June 15, a tropical wave with associated instability was observed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It moved into the central Gulf of Mexico on June 16, and the next day developed a weak circulation at the same time that Tropical Storm Beulah was on the other side of the gulf. The system in the eastern gulf moved to the northeast, becoming a tropical depression by June 18 at 0000 UTC. Moving quickly to the northeast, the system moved across central Florida in less than six hours, making landfall near Tampa Bay and exiting near Cape Canaveral.\n\nAs the depression struck western Florida, it produced above normal tides, which damaged docks and caused beach erosion. Wind gusts near Sarasota reached about 49 mph (80 km/h). After previously wet conditions, the system dropped heavy rainfall across the state, unofficially reaching in some areas and causing flooding. Along the Indian River, flooding damaged citrus crops, and statewide some roads were damaged due to flooding. When the storm was first forming in the Gulf of Mexico, it spawned a tornado in Miami that lasted for over 20 minutes. The National Climatic Data Center considered it the worst tornado in the city since one in 1925, and the overall path was about . A total of 77 people were injured due to the tornado, mostly due to cuts from broken glass, and damage from it was estimated at $1.5 million. Another tornado was reported north of West Palm Beach, although it affected a sparsely populated area; total damage statewide totaled $1,656,000.\n\nLate on June 18, it is estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm, and that day the Miami Hurricane Center issued its last advisory, warning ships of the potential for future strengthening. The storm moved rapidly to the northeast, passing halfway between Bermuda and North Carolina early on June 19. At 0250 UTC that day, a ship reported a falling barometric pressure of with west-southwesterly winds of . Although it was associated with a diffused frontal zone, the storm maintained a warm core and initially remained largely tropical. At 1200 UTC on June 19, it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane about halfway between Bermuda and Nova Scotia, with a pressure of . By six hours later, it became extratropical, although the former hurricane intensified further to peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). On June 20, the storm slowed and turned sharply to the northwest. It weakened slightly before moving ashore near Canso, Nova Scotia. Crossing the island, it struck Prince Edward Island before turning sharply to the east and crossing Nova Scotia again. By late on June 20, it re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean and continued to the east-northeast. The extratropical storm moved over southeastern Newfoundland and dissipated on June 21.\n\nBefore the storm reached Atlantic Canada, the Meteorological Branch of the Department of Transport provided notices for the advancing storm. On the day of the storm, the forecast from the Halifax weather office was for light winds, and although it was amended to highlight severe conditions, boats in the region had no radio to learn of the threat. There were many salmon in the region, which prompted fishermen to set sail. As the storm approached, there were about 45 boats in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.\n\nAlong the coast of New Brunswick, the storm produced 49 ft (15 m) waves that destroyed several boats, including 22 over open waters between Point Escuminac and Richibucto. Two bodies washed ashore in the latter city, and eleven bodies were eventually discovered. About one-third of the salmon boats in Miramichi were destroyed. Across New Brunswick, the storm disrupted communications near the coast. Along the coasts of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, high waves destroyed cottages and forced some families to evacuate. The former hurricane produced strong winds in the region, peaking at 75 mph (120 km/h), and its passage was accompanied by moderate rainfall, peaking at 4.29 in (109 mm) in Nova Scotia. There, many lobster cages were destroyed, and boats were removed from their moorings. In Prince Edward Island, up to 50% of lobster traps were destroyed or missing, including 5,000 destroyed traps near Souris. As with New Brunswick, several boats were destroyed or washed ashore, and damage in the province was estimated at $750,000 (1959 CAD, $781,000 1959 USD). A total of 35 people were killed between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, mostly fishermen. As a result, the Escuminac Disaster, as it came to be known, became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick. The Minister of Fisheries considered the event as \"the worst disaster to hit a Canadian fishing fleet in about 100 years.\"\n\nIn the days after the storm, the Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Mounted Police operated search and rescue missions, while families waited on the beach. The Canadian Red Cross set up headquarters in Escuminac to assist the victims. Due to storm fatalities, 24 adults became widows, and 83 children lost a father. As a result, the New Brunswick Fishermen's Disaster Fund was created to assist the families. The fund raised $400,000 in a few months from donations from throughout Canada, as well as Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, the latter who was on a tour of the country at the time.\n\nIn memory of the storm victims, artist Claude Roussel created a wood sculpture entitled \"Les Pêcheurs – The Fishermen\", which won first prize at New Brunswick Museum in 1962. Later, residents near Escuminac raised money to turn the work into a stone monument, which was dedicated on June 19, 1969. It was nearly 7 ft (2.3 m) in height, weighed about 10,000 lbs (5 tonnes), and depicted a group of fishermen working together, with the names of the deceased on a bronze plaque. In 2001, the government of New Brunswick declared the Escuminac Disaster Monument as a provincial historical site.\n\n\n"}

For dry cells, the holder must also make electrical contact with the battery terminals. For wet cells, cables are often connected to the battery terminals, as is found in automobiles or emergency lighting equipment.\n\nA battery holder is either a plastic case with the shape of the housing moulded as a compartment or compartments that accepts a battery or batteries, or a separate plastic holder that is mounted with screws, eyelets, glue, double-sided tape, or other means. Battery holders may have a lid to retain and protect the batteries or may be sealed to prevent damage to circuitry and components from battery leakage. Coiled spring wire or flat tabs that press against the battery terminals are the two most common methods of making the electrical connection inside a holder. External connections on battery holders are usually made by contacts with pins, surface mount feet, solder lugs, or wire leads.\n\nWhere the battery is expected to last over the life of the product, no holder is necessary, and a tab welded to the battery terminals can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board.\n\nIn the late 1800s patents were issued for consumer products like flashlights; patent no. 617592 dated March 1898 is for an early metal flashlight that accepted D batteries.\n\nSome early 1900s battery holders were often no more than a cardboard box with copper contacts. By the 1920s, battery holders used twin metal clips (like fuse holders) to hold the battery in place while making electrical contact. Patent no. 1439429 was granted in Dec., 1922 for an assembly with two spring arm clips, a small switch and a lamp assembly on the end of connected wires.\n\nThe introduction of polypropylene in the 1950s and miniature batteries by Eveready allowed for the use of small plastic battery holders. These are still common in toys, decorations, and lighted or blinking items. In 1957, electric wrist watches gained popularity with the public.\n\nBattery holders developed in parallel with batteries over time; as battery package sizes shrunk so did the holders. In the 1980s, the first circuit board mounting lithium coin cell battery holders appeared in the form of patent no. 4487820 by the battery holder manufacturer MPD.\n\nThe electronics industry now uses many surface mounted lithium battery holders or sockets. CR2/3A, CR1/2AA and CR123A batteries began in camera applications, but expanded into new markets like alarm systems, hand held computers, and keyfobs.\n\nDesign of the battery holder requires knowledge of how and where the larger product will be used. Human factors to be considered include ease of battery exchange, age range and physical condition of the intended user. These elements must be taken into account for a design to be successful and are part of the design process. A designer must select between a battery holder molded into the product case or made as a separate part. For many products regulations and product safety standards affect the battery holder selection.\n\nMost current battery holders are made with polypropylene or nylon bodies rated for 80-100 °C. Lithium coin cell holders are made with high temperature PBT, nylon or LCP bodies because they normally are circuit board mounted and require wave soldering at 180-240 °C or reflow soldering at 260-300 °C.\n\nBattery contacts are the most important part of the design and require serious consideration. Since batteries are nickel-plated, it is recommended the contacts be nickel-plated to prevent galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals. Battery contacts may be fixed contacts, flexible contacts, or some combination of the two.\n\nFixed contacts are inexpensive but prone to loss of electrical connection. Combination of fixed and flexible contacts are a better solution, but this is subject to an open circuit upon movement in the direction away from the fixed position; the spring contact compresses and allows the battery to move away from the fixed contact. A flexible contact allows for slight expansion of the cell on discharge, as internal chemicals increase in volume. Flexible contacts with multiple fingers touching the anode and cathode allow for movement in multiple directions without losing electrical connection.\n\nFeatures like polarity, or reverse battery, protection can be part of the design. The contact for the anode side can be recessed behind plastic and receive a battery nub common on Alkaline batteries. Another method is a plastic channel to receive a battery post or terminal. In July 2010, Microsoft announced its plans to partner with several other companies, including Duracell and MPD, to utilize its patent no. 2007/0275299 A1, which is a new kind of polarity protection in which a battery can be inserted into a battery holder in either orientation and still operate properly. Although other technologies have existed which could do this, they were expensive or caused a passive energy drain on the battery, whereas this solution is purely mechanical and affordable to produce.\n\nBattery types such as the 9-volt have snap-on contacts.\n\nBattery holders for zinc-air batteries must not be completely air-tight since approximately 1 litre of air is required per ampere-hour of discharge per cell. The battery holder may include a valve integrated with the device power switch to allow air to be admitted when the device is switched on.\n\n\n\n"}

He worked as an engineer on dynamo and turbine design, and power generation, with great influence on the naval and electrical engineering fields. He also developed optical equipment, for searchlights and telescopes.\n\nParsons was born in London into an Anglo-Irish family, youngest son of the famous astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse. The family seat is Birr Castle, County Offaly, Ireland, and the town of Birr was called Parsonstown, after the family, from 1620 to 1899.\n\nWith his three brothers, Parsons was educated at home in Ireland by private tutors (including John Purser), all of whom were well versed in the sciences and also acted as practical assistants to the Earl in his astronomical work. One of them later became, as Sir Robert Ball, Astronomer Royal for Ireland. Parsons then read mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin and St. John's College, Cambridge, graduating from the latter in 1877 with a first-class honours degree. He joined the Newcastle-based engineering firm of W.G. Armstrong as an apprentice, an unusual step for the son of an earl; then moved to Kitsons in Leeds where he worked on rocket-powered torpedoes; and then in 1884 moved to Clarke, Chapman and Co., ship engine manufacturers near Newcastle, where he was head of their electrical equipment development. He developed a turbine engine there in 1884 and immediately utilized the new engine to drive an electrical generator, which he also designed. Parsons' steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionised marine transport and naval warfare.\n\nAnother type of steam turbine at the time, invented by Gustaf de Laval, was an impulse design that subjected the mechanism to huge centrifugal forces and so had limited output due to the weakness of the materials available. Parsons explained that his appreciation of the scaling issue led to his 1884 breakthrough on the compound steam turbine in his 1911 Rede Lecture:\n\n\"It seemed to me that moderate surface velocities and speeds of rotation were essential if the turbine motor was to receive general acceptance as a prime mover. I therefore decided to split up the fall in pressure of the steam into small fractional expansions over a large number of turbines in series, so that the velocity of the steam nowhere should be great...I was also anxious to avoid the well-known cutting action on metal of steam at high velocity.\"\n\nIn 1889, he founded C. A. Parsons and Company in Newcastle to produce turbo generators to his design. In the same year he set up the Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company (DisCO). In 1890, DisCo opened Forth Banks Power Station, the first power station in the world to generate electricity using turbo generators.\nIn 1894 he regained certain patent rights from Clarke Chapman. Although his first turbine was only 1.6% efficient and generated a mere 7.5 kilowatts, rapid incremental improvements in a few years led to his first megawatt turbine built in 1899 for a generating plant at Elberfeld, Germany.\n\nParsons was also interested in marine applications and founded the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company in Newcastle. Famously, in June 1897, his turbine-powered yacht, \"Turbinia\", was exhibited moving at speed at Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Fleet Review off Portsmouth, to demonstrate the great potential of the new technology. The \"Turbinia\" moved at . The fastest Royal Navy ships using other technologies reached . Part of the speed improvement was attributable to the slender hull of the \"Turbinia\".\n\nWithin two years, the destroyers HMS \"Viper\" and were launched with Parsons' turbines, soon followed by the first turbine powered passenger ship, Clyde steamer TS \"King Edward\" in 1901; the first turbine transatlantic liners RMS \"Victorian\" and \"Virginian\" in 1905, and the first turbine powered battleship, in 1906, all of which were driven by Parsons' turbine engines. Today, \"Turbinia\" is housed in a purpose-built gallery at the Discovery Museum, Newcastle.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1898 and received their Rumford Medal in 1902, their Copley Medal in 1928 and delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1918. He was the president of the British Association for 1916–1919. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924 at Toronto. He was knighted in 1911 and made a member of the Order of Merit in 1927.\n\nThe Parsons turbine company survives in the Heaton area of Newcastle and is now part of Siemens, a German conglomerate. Sometimes referred to as Siemens Parsons, the company recently completed a major redevelopment programme, reducing the size of its site by around three quarters and installing the latest manufacturing technology. In 1925 Charles Parsons acquired the Grubb Telescope Company and renamed it Grubb Parsons. That company survived in the Newcastle area until 1985.\n\nParsons was also known for inventing the Auxetophone, an early compressed air gramophone.\n\nParsons' ancestral home at Birr Castle in Ireland houses a museum detailing the contribution the Parsons family have made to the fields of science and engineering, with part of the museum given over to marine engineering work of Charles Parsons.\n\nIn 1883 Parsons married Katharine Bethell, the daughter of William F. Bethell. They had two children: Rachel Mary Parsons (b. 1885), and Algernon George Parsons (b. 1886), who was killed in action during World War I in 1918, aged 31.\n\nCharles Algernon Parsons died on 11 February 1931, on board the steamship \"Duchess of Richmond\" while on a cruise with his wife. The cause of death was given as neuritis. A memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on 3 March 1931. Parsons was buried in the parish church of St Bartholomew's in Kirkwhelpington in Northumberland.\n\nHis widow, Katharine, died at her home in Ray Demesne, Kirkwhelpington, Northumberland in 1933. Rachel Parsons died in 1956; stableman Denis James Pratt was convicted of her manslaughter.\n\nIn 1919 Katharine and her daughter co-founded the Women's Engineering Society, which is still in existence today.\n\nSir Charles Parsons is depicted on the reverse of an Irish silver 15 Euros silver Proof coin that was struck in 2017.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5042021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5042021", "title": "Cofiring", "text": "Cofiring\n\nCo-firing is the combustion of two (or more) different types of materials at the same time. One of the advantages of co-firing is that an existing plant can be used to burn a new fuel, which may be cheaper or more environmentally friendly. For example, biomass is sometimes co-fired in existing coal plants instead of new biomass plants. Another example is that biomass primary fuel fractions can be cofired with waste-derived fuels in biomass plants leading to an environmentally friendly destruction of waste fractions and cost-effective heat and power production. Co-firing can also be used to improve the combustion of fuels with low energy content. For example, landfill gas contains a large amount of carbon dioxide, which is non-combustible. If the landfill gas is burned without removing the carbon dioxide, the equipment may not perform properly or emissions of pollutants may increase. Co-firing it with natural gas increases the heat content of the fuel and improves combustion and equipment performance. As long as the electricity or heat produced with the biomass and landfill gas was otherwise going to be produced with non-renewable fuels, the benefits are essentially equivalent whether they are cofired or combusted alone. Also, co-firing can be used to lower the emission of some pollutants. For example, co-firing biomass with coal results in less sulfur emissions than burning coal by itself.\n\nCo-firing (also referred to as complementary firing or co-combustion) is the combustion of two different fuels in the same combustion system. Fuels can be solid fuels, liquid fuels or gaseous, and its source either fossil or renewable. Therefore, use of heavy fuel oil assisting coal power stations may technically be considered co-firing. However, the term co-firing is used in the present technological framework to designate combined combustion of two (or more) fuels sustained in time, as a normal daily practice.\n\nThe interest in co-firing and the use of this term sprung up in the 1980s in the U.S. and Europe, and referred specifically to the use of waste solid residues (paper, plastic, solvents, tars, etc.) or biomass in coal power stations that were designed only for the combustion of coal, and attempted, because of the existence of those new opportunity fuels, to carry out a combined combustion in order to increase benefit margins. This interest in co-firing has grown in the last decade mainly due to increasing social concern about global warming and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The consequences of this concern are new policies on energy and the environment aimed at reducing emissions. Co-firing is regarded as a great opportunity for replacing coal (solid fossil fuel) used for power generation with renewable fuels (biomass) with lower costs and a direct decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. During the last few decades research has provided very diverse solutions for co-firing biomass in coal power stations with a limited impact on efficiency, operation and lifespan.\n\nIn the present context the definition of co-firing could be: The use together of two (or more) fuels, the primary being fossil and the secondary from another source (renewable or residual), in a boiler originally designed for fossil fuel, either using the original combustion system or additional devices.\n\nThe concept of co-firing is quite simple. It consists in the use of two or more fuels inside the same combustion device. It is applicable to all kind of combustion systems traditionally used for power generation (pulverized fuel, fluidized bed combustion and grate firing). Co-firing in cement kilns is already a quite widespread solution for valorization of waste materials mostly, as well as for biomass. The iron industry (blast furnace) and domestic sector (coal stoves) are also sectors where co-firing could be implemented.\n\nThe use of a secondary fuel (biomass or waste) replacing a share of the original fossil fuel may require trivial changes in the facility, or a complete retrofitting with important reforms. Modifications will depend on the characteristics of the fuels, the original combustion technology, the plant layout and the type and location of auxiliary systems. The percentage of original fuel replaced, also known as co-firing rate (either expressed in mass or in energy basis) is furthermore a definitive parameter limiting the technical solutions valid for a specific plant.\n\nThe co-firing systems, according to the current state of the art and the future perspectives, can be classified into direct and indirect co-firing technologies. The former refer to those systems where combustion of both fuels takes place at the same combustion device or into the same boiler simultaneously. The secondary fuel (biomass, waste) may be either mixed with coal before the combustion starts or fed by a separate device, e.g. specific biomass burners. Indirect co-firing, on the contrary, separates the combustion of both solid fuels, though Combustion Gasses may be mixed afterwards.\n\nDirect biomass co-firing systems entail advantages of simplicity and economics. However direct co-firing systems are also more sensitive to variations in fuel quality and heterogeneity. Additionally other problems limit the rate of secondary fuel replacing the original fossil fuels. In example ash deposition (fouling and slagging) and corrosion usually increase with the use of biomass and wastes replacing coal, what may shorten the lifespan of diverse devices in contact with Combustion Gasses like superheaters, heat exchangers, selective catalytic reduction (SCR), etc. Direct co-firing systems include next technological solutions:\n\nIndirect co-firing systems imply usually more complex and expensive solutions, but they reduce usually problems related with corrosion, fouling, slagging, etc. This, a priori, allows co-firing rates larger than direct systems, that is, larger percentages of coal substituted by biomass or waste. In addition, indirect co-firing systems are in general better for fuel mixtures where secondary fuel may include potential contaminants like heavy metals or other dangerous inorganic compounds.\n\nMain indirect co-firing systems are listed next:\n\nUse of biomass in co-firing incorporate additional environmental, socio-economic and strategy advantages regarding the use of biomass in dedicated biomass plants. In case of waste residues there are no additional benefits, however the combustion of waste may change the emissions regulations to satisfy more strict regulations. For example, limits in emissions from environmental regulations for large scale combustion facilities are more permissive than regulations for incineration plants. Except for the previous drawback related to waste co-firing, the following advantages are common for waste and biomass co-firing:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2936393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2936393", "title": "Contact explosive", "text": "Contact explosive\n\nA contact explosive is a chemical substance that explodes violently when it is exposed to a relatively small amount of energy (friction, pressure, sound, light). Though different substances have varying amounts of energy sensitivity, they are all much more sensitive relative to other explosives. Contact explosives are a part of a group of explosives called primary explosives which are also very sensitive to stimuli but not to the degree of contact explosives. The extreme sensitivity of contact explosives is due to either its composition, bonds, or structure.\n\nThese are some common contact explosives.\n\nExplosives that are nitrogen-based are incredibly volatile due to the stability of nitrogen in its diatomic state, N. Most organic explosives are explosive because they contain nitrogen. They are defined as nitro compounds.\n\nSince nitrogen wants to escape the unstable bonds it has in a big compound so that it can form its highly stable N form, it makes the compound sensitive to exploding. The presence of nitrogen in these explosives also makes them much more powerful. The triple bond that holds N together has an incredible amount of bond energy that when it forms it releases the nitrogen gas at high energies over a short period of time thus creating a huge explosion.\n\nSome contact explosives contain an oxidizer and a fuel in their composition. Chemicals like gasoline, a fuel, burn instead of explode because they must come into contact with oxygen in the combustion reaction. However, if the compound already contains both the oxidant and fuel, it produces a much faster and violent reaction.\nThe structures and bonds that make up a contact explosive contribute to its instability. Covalent compounds that have a large unequal sharing of electrons have the capability to fall apart very easily and explosively. Nitrogen triiodide is a perfect example of this property. The three huge iodine atoms try to attach themselves to one small nitrogen ion, which means that the atoms are holding on to each other through a very weak bond. The weak bond between each atom is like a thread just waiting to break. Therefore, any small amount of applied energy cuts this thread and releases the iodine and nitrogen atoms to react with the fuel, allowing the reaction to occur quickly and release a large amount of energy.\n\nThe shape of the contact explosive molecule plays a role in its instability as well. Using nitrogen triiodide as an example again, its pyramidal shape forces the three iodine atoms to be incredibly close to each other. The shape further strains the already weak bonds that holds together this molecule.\nContact explosives are used in a variety of fields.\n\nMilitaries use a variety of contact explosives in combat. Some can be manufactured into different types of bombs, tactical grenades, and even explosive bullets. Dry picric acid, which is more powerful than TNT, was used in blasting charges and artillery shells. A lot of contact explosives are used in detonators. For explosives that use secondary explosives, contact explosives are used in the detonators to set off an energy chain reaction that will eventually set off the secondary explosive.\n\nCompounds like lead azide are used to manufacture bullets that explode into shrapnel on impact.\n\nFlash powders are used in a variety of military and police tactical pyrotechnics. Stun grenades, flash bangs, and flares all use flash powder to create bright flashing lights and loud noise that disorients the enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, many of these cheap, volatile contact explosives are also used in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) created by terrorists and suicide bombers. For example, acetone peroxide passes through explosive detectors and is incredibly powerful, unstable, and deadly. Evidence for the instability of these IEDs lies in the multiple reports of premature or wrongful IED explosions. However, when these explosives are used correctly, they have devastating consequences. The July 7th 2005 London bombings, the 2015 Paris attacks, and the 2016 Brussels bombings all used explosives that contained acetone peroxide.\n\nAngina pectoris, an unfortunate symptom of Ischaemic heart disease, is treated with nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is known as a vasodilator. Vasodilators work by relaxing the heart's blood vessels so the heart does not need to work as hard. Picric acid specifically has been used for burn treatment and as an Antiseptic.\n\nThe same flash powder used for military tactical pyrotechnics can also be used for several theatrical special effects. They are used to produce loud, bright flashes of light for effect. Though some flash powders are too volatile and dangerous to be safely used, there are milder compounds that are still incorporated into performances today.\n\nSilver Fulminate is used to make noise-makers, small contact poppers, and several other novelty fireworks. It is most widely used in bang snaps. In these small explosives, a minuscule amount of silver fulminate is encased in gravel and cigarette paper. Even with this small amount of silver fulminate, it produces a loud, sharp bang.\n\n\n"}

It follows a two-year portion of an ongoing class action lawsuit against the Chevron Corporation in Ecuador.\n\nThe film follows the progress during 2006 and 2007 of a $27 billion legal case brought against the Chevron Corporation following the drilling of the Lago Agrio oil field, a case described by activists as an \"Amazon Chernobyl\".\nThe plaintiffs of the class action lawsuit are 30,000 Ecuadorians living in the Amazonian rainforest who claim their ancestral homeland has been polluted by the oil industry. In addition to the legal struggle, \"Crude\" shows interviews from representatives of the plaintiffs and defendants of the class action lawsuit, and explores the influence of media support such as Vanity Fair, celebrity activism including support from musical artist Sting and his wife Trudie Styler, the power of multinational corporations, the shifting power in Ecuadorian politics, and rapidly disappearing indigenous cultures explored in the movie.\n\nThe film ends with a prediction the lawsuit will not be resolved for another decade or so unless an out of court settlement is arranged.\n\n\nChevron noted that a scene in the film \"Crude\" presented at the Sundance Film Festival, showed an environmental scientist present at a legal strategy meeting of plaintiffs' lawyers; that same scientist was later appointed by the Ecuadorian court as an ostensibly impartial expert to write a report on technical issues. However, the scene was cut from the theatrical release; Chevron lawyers wanted to know what other potentially compromising scenes were left out by Berlinger. On May 6, 2010 federal judge Lewis Kaplan sided with a petition submitted by Chevron and ruled that Berlinger turn over more than 600 hours of original footage created during the film's production. Chevron had sought to subpoena the footage as part of the ongoing lawsuit discussed in the film. Berlinger's legal team has maintained that the footage is protected by reporters' privilege and appealed the court's decision.\n\nIn his appeal, Berlinger noted that he was a highly awarded and respected independent filmmaker, that he was independent of Donziger, and argued that he had in fact gone to great lengths to make \"Crude\" a balanced portrayal. Berlinger acknowledged that he had \"tweaked\" some scenes at Donziger’s request. The scene showing the environmental scientist at the legal strategy session had been cut from the theatrical release (but not the online version for Netflix) after one of the plaintiff lawyers objected to Berlinger that showing the scene was “so serious we could lose everything.\" The US 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed the scope slightly (Berlinger had to turn over 500 hours of outtakes, rather than 600), but in 2011 upheld the lower court ruling against Berlinger, Judge Pierre Leval writing for the court: \"Those who do not retain independence as to what they will publish but are subservient to the objectives of others who have a stake in what will be published have either a weaker privilege or none at all.\"\n\nThe evidence provided by the film outtakes played an important role in Chevron obtaining a 2014 US court ruling that the American lawyers for the plaintiffs had used fraud and corruption in obtaining the $19 billion Ecuadorian court judgment against Chevron. That judgment was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on August 8, 2016.\n\nThe outtakes indicate the filmmakers were on notice that the plaintiffs were engaging in seriously shady tactics against Chevron--but failed to address it in their production. On September 7, 2018 the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague unanimously issued an award in favor of Chevron and Texaco Petroleum Company. The decision concluded that the judgment in Ecuador was fraudulent, corrupt and “should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other States.” The amount Ecuador must pay to Chevron to compensate for damages is yet to be determined. The award found that Ecuador violated its obligations under international treaties, investment agreements and international law. The Court of Arbitration’s findings of fraudulent activities included: \n\n-That the evidence placed before the Court is “the most thorough documentary, video, and testimonial proof of fraud ever put before an arbitral tribunal.\" \n\n-That the plaintiffs championed by the film actually were engaged in blackmail and bribery of Ecuadorian judges. Their efforts triggered an order to appoint an “expert” friendly to the plaintiffs. \n\n-That Ecuadorian government prosecutors “actively cooperated” with the plaintiffs. \n\n-That the plaintiffs bribed the “experts” and ghostwrote their report. \n\n-That the plaintiffs paid a retired judge to draft the acting judge’s orders—and that the same judge solicited bribes that Chevron refused to pay.\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 65 reviews, and an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dynamic, tightly arranged, and deliberately provocative, Joe Berlinger's \"Crude\" is a sobering, enraging wake-up call.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"Crude\" has been reviewed in \"The New York Times\", in \"LA Weekly\", on \"AlterNet\", and by Howard Zinn.\n\n\"Crude\" premiered on January 18, 2009 at the Sundance Film Festival and had its theatrical premiere on September 9, 2009, at the IFC Center in New York City.\n\n\n\n"}

Many ores are suitable for direct reduction.\n\nReduced iron derives its name from the chemical change that iron ore undergoes when it is heated in a furnace at high temperatures in the presence of hydrocarbon-rich gases, carbon monoxide, or elemental carbon. Direct reduction refers to processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting point of iron. The product of such solid state processes is called direct reduced iron.\n\nThe reducing gas is a mixture of gases, primarily hydrogen (H) and carbon monoxide (CO). The process temperature is typically 800 to 1200 °C.\n\nDirect reduction processes can be divided roughly into two categories: gas-based, and coal-based. In both cases, the objective of the process is to drive off the oxygen contained in various forms of iron ore (sized ore, concentrates, pellets, mill scale, furnace dust, etc.), in order to convert the ore to metallic iron, without melting it (below 1200 °C).\n\nThe direct reduction process is comparatively energy efficient. Steel made using DRI requires significantly less fuel, in that a traditional blast furnace is not needed. DRI is most commonly made into steel using electric arc furnaces to take advantage of the heat produced by the DRI product.\n\nIn modern times, direct reduction processes have been developed to specifically overcome the difficulties of conventional blast furnaces. DRI is successfully manufactured in various parts of the world. The initial investment and operating costs of direct reduction plants are low compared to integrated steel plants and are more suitable for developing countries where supplies of coking coal are limited.\n\nFactors that help make DRI economical:\n\nIndia is the world’s largest producer of direct-reduced iron, a vital constituent of the steel industry. Many other countries use variants of the process, so providing iron for local engineering industries.\n\nDirect reduced iron is highly susceptible to oxidation and rusting if left unprotected, and is normally quickly processed further to steel. The bulk iron can also catch fire since it is pyrophoric. Unlike blast furnace pig iron, which is almost pure metal, DRI contains some siliceous gangue, which needs to be removed in the steel-making process.\n\nProducing sponge iron and then working it was the earliest method used to obtain iron in the Middle East, Egypt, and Europe, where it remained in use until at least the 16th century. There is some evidence that the bloomery method was also used in China, but China had developed blast furnaces to obtain pig iron by 500 BCE.\n\nThe advantage of the bloomery technique is that iron can be obtained at a lower furnace temperature, only about 1,100 °C or so. The disadvantage, relative to a blast furnace, is that only small quantities can be made at a time.\n\nThe following carbothermic reactions reduce iron ore to iron.\n\nhematite becomes magnetite by reduction with carbon monoxide and hydrogen\n\n<chem> 3 Fe2O3 + CO -> 2 Fe3O4 + CO2</chem>\n\n<chem> 3 Fe2O3 + H2 -> 2 Fe3O4 + H2O</chem>\n\nmagnetite becomes ferrous oxide by reduction with carbon monoxide and hydrogen\n\n<chem> Fe3O4 + CO -> 3 FeO + CO2</chem>\n\n<chem> Fe3O4 + H2 -> 3 FeO + H2O</chem>\n\nferrous oxide becomes sponge iron by reduction with carbon monoxide and hydrogen\n\n<chem> FeO + CO -> Fe + CO_2</chem>\n\n<chem> FeO + H2 -> Fe + H2O</chem>\n\ncarburizing produces cementite\n\n<chem> 3 Fe + CH4 -> Fe3C + 2H2</chem>\n\n<chem> 3 Fe + 2CO -> Fe3C + CO2</chem>\n\n<chem> 3 Fe + CO +H2 -> Fe3C + H2O</chem>\n\nSponge iron is not useful by itself, but can be processed to create wrought iron. The sponge is removed from the furnace, called a bloomery, and repeatedly beaten with heavy hammers and folded over to remove the slag, oxidise any carbon or carbide and weld the iron together. This treatment usually creates wrought iron with about three percent slag and a fraction of a percent of other impurities. Further treatment may add controlled amounts of carbon, allowing various kinds of heat treatment (e.g. \"steeling\").\n\nToday, sponge iron is created by reducing iron ore without melting it. This makes for an energy-efficient feedstock for specialty steel manufacturers which used to rely upon scrap metal.\n\n\n\n"}

Numerous types of sleds are used, depending on their function. They can be used for dog sled racing. In Greenland the dogs pull in a fan shape in front of the sled opposed to other regions where to dogs pull side by side in pairs.\n\nDog power has been used for hunting and travel for over a thousand years. As far back as the 10th century BCE these dogs have contributed to human culture.\n\nAssembling a dog sled team involves picking leader dogs, point dogs, swing dogs, and wheel dogs. The lead dog is crucial, so mushers take particular care of these dogs. Another important detail is to have powerful wheel dogs to pull the sled out from the snow. Point dogs (optional) are located behind the leader dogs, swing dogs between the point and wheel dogs, and team dogs are all other dogs in between the wheel and swing dogs and are selected for their endurance, strength, and speed as part of the team. In dog sledding, Siberian Huskies or Alaskan Malamutes are the main types of dogs that are used for recreational sledding because of their strength and speed and endurance as well as their ability to withstand the cold. However, Alaskan Huskies (a mix between Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes) are also a popular dog for sled dog racing, because of their endurance, good eating habits, speed, and dedication to running even when tired.\n\nSometimes, for sprint races, mushers use short haired hounds that are faster than the average husky. These hounds are raised from a young age to pull. It is harder to train hounds than it is to train Siberian Huskies and Malamutes to pull a sled because it is not in their nature. Training should start at around six months of age by pulling a small log behind them.\n\n\n"}

The foundation has a mission to end the United States' dependence on oil by removing barriers to competition in the transportation fuel market. The founders believe that fuel prices could be permanently reduced to below $1 a gallon.\n\nThe foundation's Board of Advisors includes former CIA Director R. James Woolsey, Jr., former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, former president of the Rockefeller Foundation Peter Goldmark, former dean of the University of Colorado's Graduate School of Public Policy Marshall Kaplan, former president of Shell Oil Company John Hofmeister and Co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security Gal Luft. The CEO is Joseph A. Cannon.\n\nThe foundation believes that high oil prices are a result of a systematic monopoly. Contrary to a more traditional monopoly, where one company has a large enough market share to control prices, the oil-market is believed to be a monopolistic market because oil is the primary, and in most cases the only, fuel for transportation. These monopolistic forces create a situation where oil expenditures in the U.S. top $780 billion per year, more than twenty times the amount spent on coal.\n\nAccording to the Foundation, outdated regulations prevent drivers from making simple modifications to their engines that would enable their cars to run on alternatives fuels, hence threatening oil's monopoly over the transportation fuel market. Updating these regulations to allow for current vehicles to modify their engines would allow for a near-term, widespread expansion of fuel choice for drivers. Ethanol, methanol, natural gas and electric cars are seen as viable replacement fuels to compete against oil in an open market. No one fuel is explicitly favored over the others but most people believe methanol made from natural gas holds the most promise to break oil's monopoly.\n\n"}

The stone displays patterns on its surface that have been interpreted as Simplified Chinese characters and Traditional Chinese characters, and have been read as \"Communist Party of China\" (), or alternatively as \"Communist Party of China perish\" ().\n\nHidden Character Stone is a main attraction along with a jade water basin (玉水金盆) that is part of the Qiannan Pingtang National Geological Park (黔南平塘地质公园). The park has an area of about 201.6 square kilometers. The stone is in a narrow gap between two cliffs, just wide enough for two people.\n\nIn June 2002, the Duyun international photography exposition (都匀国际摄影博览会) recommended an area in Zhangbu as a photo spot. The stone was discovered during cleanup after the expo. The area has been isolated, untouched by humans for a long time. The person cleaning the area was staff member Wang Guo-fu (王国富), who discovered the characters written on the stone.\n\nFrom December 5–8, 2003 a Chinese scientific inspection group was formed to investigate the stone with about 15 scientists. Some of the notables include Li Ting-dong (李廷栋) from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Liu Bao-jun (刘宝君) from Chinese academy of Sciences and Li Feng-lin (李凤麟) from China University of Geosciences. The stone was analyzed to be about 270 million years old from the Permian period. There are no traces of the characters being made by humans. Other researchers included Li Feng-lin (李鳳麟) and Gu Jing-yi (賈精一).\n\nLi Ting-dong further commented about the stone's contribution to science, and that there is nothing like it. Liu Bao-jun further support additional research to be done and was interested in the natural formation of the characters on the stone. Each character on the stone is about one square shaku, which is about 1 square foot.\n\nThe five-character version suggests the characters on the stone said \"Communist Party of China\" (中国共产党). This is the version publicly accepted in the PRC. Also when referring to this version, the stone has been called (救星石), literally \"savior stone\". This name comes from people who are passionate in supporting and admire the Communist Party. The story of how the stone was discovered usually follows this version. Zhang Dahua (张大华) of Zhangbu village once publicly gave an explanation of how the name \"savior stone\" was created.\n\nThe six-character version suggests the characters on the stone said \"Communist Party of China perish\" (中国共产党亡). There has been criticism that the sixth and last character \"perish\" (亡) has been purposely neglected to turn a \"Perish communist stone\" (亡共石) into a \"savior stone\". This is not a version accepted in the PRC, hence when mainland media reports it, it has to hide the perish character. Often when pictures are shown with the stone having six characters, the description still refers to it by the five-character version. In Chinese text the character \"perish\" (亡) is often used in association with the perish of a state like \"Chu perish\" (楚亡), \"Wei perish\" (魏亡).\n\nThe characters on the stone are a mix of Traditional Chinese characters and Simplified Chinese characters. The first and third character (, ) are identical in both versions. The second character \"country\" () and fourth character \"produce\" () is in the traditional form. The fifth character, \"party\" () is in the simplified form. The sixth character \"perish\" () has no difference. Some have analyzed all the odd characters as Simplified, while the even characters are Traditional.\n\n\nThe origin of the characters remain a subject of dispute. There were some early speculations that the characters were put there by the People's Liberation Army, but according to the path of the Long March, they never went to Pingtang. The characters also read left to right, which was not practiced at the time. The inclusion of a Simplified character before the CPC did any simplifications also ruled them out. There were also some skeptics who suspected the village was creating a fraud to build their tourism industry at the time.Others think the Hidden Character Stone was made in the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe Hidden Character Stone has appeared as a topic on a number of shows such as CCTV's \"Approaching Science\" (走近科学) and the Hong Kong ATV show \"China's Mystery Files\" (中國神祕檔案). Both refer to the five-character version.\n"}

InMotion is based in Helmond and is composed mostly of students from the Eindhoven University of Technology and Fontys University of Applied Sciences. The team was founded in 2012 by Albert Maas under the guidance of Maarten Steinbuch . \nIn 2017, the Fusion, the team’s first car, was built. The Fusion is an electric formula car and holds the electric lap record in Circuit Zandvoort , Circuit Zolder and TT Circuit Assen . \nThe team is currently developing an endurance race car, the Vision. The goal is to develop the first fully electric car to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in the Garage 56 class .\n\nIn 2009, a group of students from the University of Applied Sciences of Utrecht presented their graduation project: an eco-friendly formula race car, the Formula Bio. Their dream was to participate in the Formula Student, a race similar to Formula 1, only for students. The Formula Bio stood for environmentally friendly and inexpensive race cars.\nAfter they graduated, one of the group members went to study at Eindhoven University of Technology. This student, Albert Maas, came into contact with Maarten Steinbuch . Together they came up with the idea of participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans with a fully electric car. In 2012, the InMotion student team was officially established.\n\nThe Fusion is the fastest electric formula car in the world, with a top speed of 246 km/h.\nThe Fusion is built to break track records of circuits, and not to fit into a particular ranking, so the car does not have to meet certain restrictions. How is the car so fast? This is due to a combination of different techniques. The propulsion is important, and also the aerodynamics of the car. The small size of the car also plays a role. Below are some facts to get a better understanding of the Fusion.\n\nThe InMotion team launched its first full electric racing car in 2016. The car was based on the former Formula Bio car has been built on a carbon fiber chassis. The full electric engine has a better power to weight ratio compared to a Formula E car. The car made its track debut at Circuit Zandvoort during the 2016 Masters of Formula 3 event. Drivers Xavier Maassen and Jan Lammers gave the car a shakedown. In 2017 USF2000 driver Rinus van Kalmthout did a straight line test at the Automotive Campus Helmond test track (part of the A270 motorway). During the year the team improved track records for electric cars at two tracks. Beitske Visser improved the record at Zandvoort. Testdriver Maassen beat the track record for electric cars at Circuit Zolder, previously held by Bert Longin in a Tesla Roadster.\n\nThe Vision is a fully electric Le Mans prototype under development. Unlike the Fusion, this car is also built for its endurance. The Vision will be unique because it will be the first fully electric race car to participate in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In the Garage 56 category, InMotion can use the innovative technological developments to make the race car as fast and environmentally friendly as possible.\nEngineers of the team have already thought about the following topics for the Vision: fan system for downforce, suspension, electric powertrain, aerodynamics and the monocoque. The team has gained knowledge about most of these topics by building the Ignition and the Fusion. Furthermore, there have been several graduation projects on various topics regarding the Vision. The most important difference between these cars and the Vision is the focus on charging time.\nThe concept car is an embodiment of the future for electric driving. The ultimate goal of the team is thus literally visible and tangible. The aerodynamics of the concept car have already been carefully thought out and designed by the team.\n\nThe concept car is the embodiment of future electric mobility. The ultimate end goal of the team is now made attainable. The outline of the concept car has been carefully designed and engineered by the team. Making the end goal closer to reality, by our team tackling the primary technical challenge, charging times.\n\nPassion and ambition are the great motivations of the student team. The team consists of full-time members, part-time members, and trainees. Together, from all kinds of different disciplines, they work on one mission. The uniqueness of the InMotion student team is the ultimate goal, not an annual project. Everyone who has worked with them is seen as part of the team.\n\nIn addition, the team receives regular advice from the 'technical advisory board' and 'supervisory board'. The Supervisory Board ensures that the project continues to follow a uniform line over the years. The technical advisory board consists of experienced members who meet weekly with the current engineers in order to guarantee the transfer of knowledge and to help with problems.\n"}

Introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the 190 (W201) range, the C-Class was the smallest model in the marque's line-up until the W168 A-Class arrived in 1997. The C-Class is built at Mercedes-Benz factories in Sindelfingen and Bremen, Germany as well as numerous satellite factories in other countries. The first C-Class (W202) sedan was produced on 1 June 1993, and the first of the second generation (W203) rolled off the assembly line on 18 July 2000. The C-Class has been available with a 4Matic (i.e. four-wheel drive) option since 2002. The third generation (W204) was launched in 2007. The latest generation C-Class (W205) came out in 2014.\n\nThough originally available as a sedan and a station wagon, the W203 series in 2000 debuted a fastback coupé (SportCoupé) version that, when facelifted, became the Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class. The CLC-Class remained in production until 2011 when it was replaced by a new W204 C-Class coupé for the 2012 model year.\n\nIn October 1986, three years into Mercedes-Benz W201 (190)'s production run, work began on a successor. Design work began in 1987, with the final design by Murat Günak being selected in 1989 and the production design by Olivier Boulay delayed in January 1990, finally being patented on 19 December 1990. Rough prototypes went into testing in 1989, with first production design prototypes commencing testing in 1990. In May 1993, the first generation W202 C-Class was introduced as a replacement for the 190. The C-Class sedan was the company's entry-level model up until 1997, when Mercedes launched the A-Class. Styling themes were carried over from the previous W201 series, but the new series had a smoother and rounder design than the previous generation of compact Mercedes, with styling cues from the W124 E-Class (short, high trunk and taller tail lights), W140 S-Class (front end), and R129 SL-Class (headlights).\n\nDuring the and Formula 1 seasons, the C36 AMG served as the sport's Safety Car.\n\nIn 1994, development began on the W203 C-Class. Design work commenced in mid-1994, with the final design being approved in December 1995 by the executive board. Design patents were filed on 20 April 1998 and 4 March 1999. Testing began in 1997, with development concluding in 2000. The second generation C-Class was introduced in March 2000. The sedan debuted with a range of inline-four and V6 petrol engines and inline-four and -five diesels, later W203's received the V6 diesel. Most of the engines were carried over from the W202, but the C320 was exclusive, offering . The diesels now featured common rail direct fuel injection and variable geometry turbochargers. A six-speed manual gearbox was optional on some of the range, With exception to the C320 and C32 AMG. \nNotably (post 2005), for the first time, the number designations were no longer equivalent to the engine displacement, more specifically in the Mercedes C200 (1.8-litre), C240 (2.6-litre) and C200 CDI (2.2-litre).\n\nDaimlerChrysler introduced the W204 C-Class on 18 January 2007 and displayed it in the 2007 Geneva Auto Show. Sales started on 31 March 2007 in almost all European countries. The new family had an extended wheelbase and tracks, a stiffer bodyshell and a design inspired by the W221 S-Class with some influences from the C219 CLS-Class. The C-Class received a facelift in 2011 for the 2012 model year including new LED taillights, a revised dashboard and instrument cluster layout, and a revised front fascia and headlights. The W204 platform continued into 2015 with the C-Class coupe.\n\nThe current generation W205 C-class was launched at the 2014 Detroit Auto Show. It is the first car to use the all-new Modular Rear Architecture (MRA) platform. The new structure is significantly lighter using aluminium and high strength steel extensively throughout the body, resulting in a weight decrease.\n\nThe car was officially unveiled on 16 December 2013. W205 production commenced on 4 February 2014 at the Bremen plant. Production also occurs at Mercedes-Benz plants in East London, South Africa, Brazil and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, US. European sales began in March 2014, while the vehicle went on sale in North America in September 2014.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class 205 chassis spawned four C-Class bodystyles; Sedan (W205), Wagon (S205), Coupe (C205), and Cabriolet (A205).\n\nThe W205 Mercedes-Benz C-Class received a facelift which made its debut at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, including exterior changes and new engines.\n\nOn 10 December 2009, Daimler announced the production of the C-Class will be concentrated at the Bremen plant with additional production in the United States for the domestic market.\n\n\nPress Kit:\nPress Kit (2011–):\n"}

It uses lasers and blank cartridges to simulate actual battle.\n\nIndividual soldiers carry small laser sensors scattered over their bodies, which detect when the soldier has been illuminated by a firearm's laser. Each laser transmitter is set to mimic the effective range of the weapon on which it is used. When a person is \"hit\", a medic can use the digital readout to determine which first aid method to practice.\n\nDifferent versions of MILES systems are available to both US and international militaries. The capabilities of the individual systems can vary significantly but in general all modern systems carry information about the shooter, weapon and ammunition in the laser. When this information is received by the target, the target's MILES system uses a random number roll and a casualty probability lookup table to determine the outcome. For example, a MILES transmitter emulating an M16 rifle cannot harm an armored personnel carrier (APC), but could still \"kill\" a commander visible in the hatch of the vehicle.\n\nVehicles are typically outfitted with a belt of laser sensors or individual wireless detectors. Dismounted soldiers often wear a vest or harness with sensors as well as a \"halo\" of sensors on their helmets. MILES systems can be coupled with a real-time data link allowing position and event data to be transmitted back to a central site for data collection and display. More sophisticated systems for tanks and APCs exist that use various techniques (including scanning lasers and coupled radio systems) to allow more precise targeting of armored vehicles.\n\nThe standard is maintained by the U.S. Army's PEO-STRI branch.\n\nMILES was introduced to the U.S. Army for direct-fire, force-on-force training capability at home stations and combat training centers during operational testing in 1978 and 1979 following the conclusion of the US Army's Engineering Development program awarded to Xerox Electro-Optical Systems. The goal of the program was to design and build a tactical training system that simulates the weapons, weapon characteristics and effects of a family of weapon systems including infantry, armor and aircraft, with an initial design of 11 systems including rifles, tank guns, and missiles.\n\nMILES systems used a laser module which was mounted to the barrel of a real weapon, a blank-firing adaptor for the weapon, and an integrated receiver consisting of sensors on the helmet and load-bearing vests of the soldiers. When a blank shot was fired by a weapon, it caused the laser to fire a coded burst in the direction that the weapon was aimed. If that burst was sensed by the receiver of another soldier, the \"hit\" soldier's gear beacon made a beeping noise to let them know they were \"dead\". MILES had serious problems—when hit, the receiver did not prevent the further firing of the weapon, and it was tempting and easy for soldiers to \"cheat\" by turning the receivers off and back on again, resetting the system and therefore \"respawning\" or \"resurrecting\" themselves. In addition, no data about the engagement was kept so it was impossible to positively identify who shot whom on the battlefield, a critical piece of information when attempting to develop new tactics. MILES was also very encumbering and soldiers sometimes experienced neck pain when using it.\n\nIn 1981, Simulaser Corporation was founded by two entrepreneur engineers and began operations near Los Angeles to develop \"Advanced MILES\" training systems. Under initial contracts from Sandia National Labs, Simulaser produced standard MILES replacement laser transmitters and man-worn detector systems as well as \"Advanced MILES\" devices that incorporated player identification and scoring systems. These Advanced MILES systems made use of the CMOS 146800-series embedded controllers that had just become available at that time. The systems interleaved unique player identification codes within the weapon code bits transmitted by the laser, which were then stored by the receiver system of any player that was hit. Those systems utilized a controller gun to initialize each player, thus preventing players from \"resurrecting\" themselves by re-inserting the yellow weapon key. Each player's data was stored in memory until downloaded by the controller unit at the conclusion of the training exercise. Simulaser made use of hybrid microcircuits to reduce the size of certain components and eliminated the electronic module on the back of the helmet to improve player comfort. Simulaser also manufactured laser detector components and systems for vehicle applications sold to Sandia Labs and EG&G Inc., the operations and maintenance contractor at Kirtland AFB for use in training guards and couriers. Simulaser was acquired by Applied Solar Energy Corp. (ASEC, City of Industry, CA), its major supplier of silicon detectors, in 1984. Later, under contract from Fairchild-Weston Systems, Simulaser produced the laser and detector systems for the AGES/ADII (Air-to-Ground Engagement System/Air Defense II) program for the US Army, outfitting a number of helicopters with training systems and producing laser simulators for the HGSS/GVLLD (Hellfire Ground Support System Simulator/Ground-based Vehicle Laser Locator Designator). \nSimulaser also produced the early low rate of production run of MITS (Multiple Independent Target System) and in 1989 won a development contract from the US Army for STOM (Shoot-through Obscuration Miles) that utilized long-wavelength lasers instead of semiconductor lasers in order to penetrate battlefield obscurants. Late in 1989, Simulaser was awarded a $35 million production contract for standard MILES gear, subsequently increased to $44 million, following which Loral Electro-Optical Systems, Inc., acquired the business of Simulaser from ASEC in October 1989, after which Simulaser ceased to exist..\n\nVersions made after 1986 used a loud tone to signal when a soldier was \"killed\". In order to turn off the noise, the soldier had to remove a yellow key from the laser module on his rifle and insert it into the box on his harness. By removing the key from the laser, the weapon could no longer score hits using the MILES system. With some systems the hit soldier is required to lie on his back to stop the noise and signal others that he is \"dead\".\n\nMILES 2 was released in 1991–92, and the SAWE (simulated area weapons effects) add-on was first fielded in 1992 using GPS and RF messages so that vehicles and individual soldiers can be killed from a central location due to artillery strikes, or nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons strikes. Implementation in the Summer and Fall of 1992 was at Hohenfels, Germany at the Combat Maneuver Training Center. In 1993, the range at Fort Polk was installed and tested. At the time, there were plans to add SAWE at the NTC at Fort Irwin, although instead this was implemented by using SAWE-like features via the DCI radio network. This was superseded in aircraft by the implementation of the SMODIM or the smart onboard data interface module instrumented in 1998 at all three Combat Training Centers (NTC, JRTC, and JMRC).\n\nAs of July 2006, the latest version of MILES was MILES XXI, provided by Lockheed Martin.\n\nAs of 2012 the most current version of fully fielded vehicle platform MILES was the Instrumentable multiple integrated laser engagement system combat vehicle tactical engagement simulation system I-MILES CVTESS). This is provided to the US Army by Saab Defense and Security Training and Simulations. It is manufactured at Saab Training in the company's office in Husqvarna, Sweden. Saab's Main Battle Tank (MBT) Crew Trainer enables the warfighter to perform live precision gunnery and combat training. The MBT Crew Trainer strengthens the entire crew's accuracy and precision. The realism and experience with the tank trainer provides the confidence needed to win the engagement.\n\nI-MILES CVTESS is a laser-based training device to be used on Abrams, Bradley, and opposing forces (OPFOR) tanks and fighting vehicles to provide real-time casualty effects. It is an evolutionary approach for replacing older I-MILES CVTESS equipment currently used in force-on-force training exercises with devices that provide better training fidelity for combat vehicle systems. It reinforces crew duties, reward proper engagement techniques and develop tactical maneuver skills of armor and mechanized infantry combined arms teams up to brigade level. It provides unit commanders an integrated training system in force-on-force and force-on-target training events at homestation training area through instrumented training. The system interfaces with instrumentation systems at maneuver combat training centers (MCTC).\n\nOne Shepherd, a division of TacComp Media, LLC, procured MILES 2000 (Cubic Defense Applications) in early 2007 as a force on force simulation platform for their vocational leadership education program. One Shepherd employs the system to teach leadership through the military decision-making process (MDMP) inherent in tactical patrolling operations and small arms gun fighting. MILES provides immediate feedback to students in a safe-to-fail environment, and affords an experiential exploration of leadership.\n\n\n"}

The clearance of the slum destroys low income homes as well as illegal squatting sites, displacing inhabitants into different housing areas with the intent of breaking up continuous zones of poverty.\n\nThis has long been a strategy for redeveloping urban communities; for example slum clearance plans were required in the United Kingdom in the Housing Act 1930. Similarly the Housing Act of 1937 encouraged similar strategies in the United States. Frequently, but not always, these programs were paired with public housing or other assistance programs for the displaced communities.\n\nCritics argue that slum removal by force tends to ignore the social problems that cause slums. Poor families, often including children and working adults, need a place to live when adequate low income housing is not providing otherwise. Moreover, slums are frequently sites of informal economies that provide jobs, services, and livelihoods not otherwise available in the community. Slum clearance removes the slum, but it does not remove the causes that create and maintain the slum. Similarly, plans to remove slums in a number of non-Western contexts have proven ineffective without sufficient housing and other support for the displaced communities; for example academics describing such strategies as detrimental in Nigeria, where the slum destruction puts further stress on already short housing stock, in some cases create new slums in other parts of the community. Some communities have opted for slum upgrading, as an alternative solution: improving the quality of services and infrastructure to match the community developed in the slum.\n\nSlum clearance is still practiced today in a number of different situations. During major international events like conferences and sporting competitions, governments have been known to forcefully clear low income housing areas, as a strategy to impress the international attention in an attempt to reduce the visibility of the host city's apparent poverty. Other attempts at slum clearance have been subject to other motivations, such as repressing political opposition or attempts to keep certain communities in check. For example, Zimbabwe's Operation Murambatsvina was widely criticized by the international community, including a scathing report from the UN which noted human rights abuses alongside poor design of the program, which was estimated to displace at least 700,000 slum dwellers.\n"}

Solar modules (or panels) are expected to have a long service life between 20 and 40 years. They must constantly and consistently deliver the power expected. In addition, modules are exposed to a wide array of weather conditions along with usage in differ climates. Therefore it is critical to determine if a module is capable of performing over many decades with exposure to differing conditions. Solar modules can be tested through a combination of physical tests, laboratory studies, and numerical analyses. Furthermore, solar modules need to be assessed throughout the different stages of their life cycle. Various companies such as Southern Research Energy & Environment, SGS Consumer Testing Services, TÜV Rheinland, CSA Solar International provide services in solar module quality assurance.\n\nThe lifecycle stages of testing solar modules can include: the Conceptual phase, manufacturing phase, transportation and installation, commissioning phase, and the in-service phase.\n\nThe first stage can involves design verification where the expected output of the module is tested through computer simulation. Further, the modules ability to withstand natural environment conditions such as temperature, rain, hail,\nsnow, corrosion, dust, lightning, horizon and near-shadow effects is tested. The layout for design and construction of the module and the quality of components and installation can also be tested at this stage.\n\nInspecting manufacturers of components is carried through visitation. The inspection can include assembly checks, material testing supervision and Non Destructive Testing (NDT). Certification is carried our according to ANSI/UL1703, IEC 17025, IEC 61215, IEC 61646, IEC 61701 and IEC 61730-1/-2.\n\nInspections include pre-dispatch inspection, dimensional control, visual control, and damage control. Documentation and certificates should also be reviewed.\n\nSolar module specialists will ensure that the production has followed correct procedure and ensure there is a save start up.\nThe in-service phase involves regular inspections of the solar modules to confirm they are performing.\n\n"}

{"id": "5786532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5786532", "title": "Vardo (Romani wagon)", "text": "Vardo (Romani wagon)\n\nA vardo (also wag(g)on, living wagon, van, and caravan) is a traditional horse-drawn wagon used by British Romani people as their home. Possessing a chimney, it is commonly thought of as being highly decorated, intricately carved, brightly painted, and even gilded. The British Romani tradition of the vardo is seen as a high cultural point of both artistic design and a masterpiece of woodcrafters art.\nThe heyday of the living wagon lasted for roughly 70 years, from the mid-1800s through the first two decades of the twentieth century. Not used for year-around living today, they are shown at the Romanichal (British Romani) horse fairs held throughout the year, the best known of which is Appleby Horse Fair.\n\nA vardo's design includes large wheels set outside the body, whose sides slope outward considerably as they rise toward the eaves. Beyond this characteristic, the six types of caravans differ in shape, size, placement of the wheels relative to the bed, where made, and maker. The roofs of the bow-top and open-lot types are canvas stretched over curved wooden frames; the others are roofed in wood. By the mid-1800s, the designs were almost entirely standardized, and some features are common to all types. The door is almost always in the front.\n\nThe small cast-iron cooking stove was invented in America and was available there and in Great Britain from about 1830 on and is a common fixture of the wagons. A cooking stove necessitates a chimney to vent smoke. A caravan's chimney is always on its left side as viewed from its front doorway; as the caravan travels along the left side of the road, the chimney is in less danger from low-hanging tree limbs in that position. The stove rests in a wooden fireplace.\n\nThe wagon's interior is typically outfitted with built-in seats, cabinets, a wardrobe, bunks in the rear of the caravan, a chest of drawers, and a glass-fronted china cabinet. There are windows on the left side and rear. Some types have clerestories which let in light and air. A bracket for an oil lamp is mounted over the chest of drawers opposite the fireplace; the chest's top functions as a table. Wagons' exteriors can range from fairly plain to intricately carved, painted in bright colors, and sheathed in places with gold leaf.\n\nThe Romanichal had arrived in the British Isles by 1500 AD, but they did not begin to live in vardos until around 1850. Prior to that, they traveled in tilted carts or afoot and slept either under or in these carts or in small tents. Originally Romanichals would travel on foot, or with light, horse-drawn carts, typical of other Romani groups or would build \"bender\" tents — so called because they were made from supple branches which they bent inwards to support a waterproof covering. The heyday of the Romani caravan was the latter part of the 19th century.\n\nInitially using castoff horses and even mules to draw their chimneyed living wagons, the Romanichal gradually created a breed of horse known variously as the Gypsy Cob (UK, NZ), Gypsy Horse (US, UK, AU), Coloured Cob (UK, Ireland, parts of continental Europe), Gypsy Vanner (USA, CAN), Tinker Horse (parts of continental Europe), and Irish Cob (Ireland) to do so.\n\nWagons were first used as a form of living accommodation (as opposed to carrying people or goods) in France in 1810 by non-Romani circus troupes. Large transport wagons combined storage space and living space into one vehicle, and were pulled by teams of horses. By the 19th century wagons became smaller, reducing the number of horses required, and around the mid-to-late-19th century (1840–1870), Romanichals in Britain started using wagons that incorporated living spaces on the inside, and added their own characteristic style of decoration. In The Old Curiosity Shop (ch. xxvii), Charles Dickens described Mrs. Jarley's well-appointed van:\n\nThese smaller wagons were called \"vardo\" in the Romani language (originating from the Ossetic word \"vurdon\") for cart. The Romani \"vardo\" evolved into some of the most advanced forms of travelling wagon, and are prized for their practicality as well as aesthetic design and beauty. There is no more iconic or recognizable Romani symbol than a highly decorated Romanichal vardo, and the time of its use is often affectionately called \"the wagon time\" by Romanichal travellers. The vardos were typically commissioned by families or by a newlywed couple from specialist coach builders. Building the vardo took between six months to a year; a variety of woods including oak, ash, elm, cedar, and pine were utilized in its construction. Prized by the Romani, and later by non-Romani, including other traveller groups, for their practicality as well as aesthetic beauty, vardos can be categorized into six main styles; these being the Brush wagon, Reading, Ledge, Bow Top, Open lot, and Burton. The general design evolved over time and were named after the home's owners, for their traditional style (Ledge), for the town of its construction (Reading), or for the name of the builder.\n\nPopular with Romanis, as well as Showmen families, and circus people, the Burton wagon is the oldest example of a wagon used as home in Britain. Originally undecorated, the Burton wagon evolved into an elaborate Romani vardo, but due to its smaller wheels it was not suited for off-road use.\n\nThe Brush or \"fen wagon\" as it was also known, consists of a standard Romani vardo, with straight sides and the wheels located outside the body. The Brush was similar in construction to the Reading vardo, but unlike other styles, the brush wagon had two distinct features: a half-door with glazed shutters, located at the back of the vardo, with a set of steps, both set around the opposite way from other wagons and lacked the mollycroft (skylight) on the roof. The exterior is equipped with racks and cases fitted on the outside frame and chase of the wagon allowing the owner to carry trade items like brushes, brooms, wicker chairs, and baskets. Additionally, three light iron rails ran around the entire roof, used for stowing bulkier goods, and sometimes trade-name boards. The wagons were elaborately and colorfully painted.\n\nThe Reading or \"kite wagon\" is so named due to its straight sides that slope outwards towards the eaves, high arched wheels, and relative light weight; there is no other vardo that epitomizes the golden age of Romani horse travel. It dates from 1870 and is synonymous with the original builder Dunton and Sons of Reading from where the vardo takes its name. The wagon was highly prized by the Romanies for its aesthetic design, beauty and practicality to cross fords, pull off road and over rough ground, something smaller-wheeled wagons like the Burton were unable to do. The Reading wagon is 10 feet long, with a porch on the front and back. The rear wheels were 18 inches larger than the ones on the front. At the start of the 20th century the design incorporated raised skylights.\n\nOn either side of the bed space, quarter-inch thick bevelled mirrors were common, and were lavishly decorated. Cupboards and locker seats were built in to prevent movement whilst travelling. Side and back windows were decorated and shuttered, and the body of the vardo itself would have originally been made from beaded tongue-and-groove matchboard, painted red picked out in yellow and green. As with other vardo, the extent of the elaborate decoration reflected the wealth of the family, boasting carved lion heads and gargoyles; these would have been painted gold or extensively decorated with gold leaf. Today, surviving Reading wagons are prized exhibits in museums or private collections.\n\nThe characteristic design of the ledge or \"cottage shaped\" wagon incorporated a more robust frame and living area that extended over the large rear wheels of the wagon. Brass brackets supported the frame of the wagon and solid arched roof usually 12 feet high, extended over the length of the wagon to form porches at either end and panelled with tongue in groove boards. The porch roof was further supported by iron brackets, and the walls were highly decorated with ornate scrollwork and carvings across the length of the wagon.\n\nBased on the design of the Ledge wagon, the Bow Top is significantly lighter, and less likely to turn over in a strong wind. The design incorporated a lightweight canvas top, supported by a wooden frame: a design reminiscent of the older “bender tents” used by the Romanichal. Both back and front walls of the wagon were decorated in scrollwork and tongue and groove and the wagon was painted green to be less noticeable in woodland. The inside of the Bow Top also contained the same high scrollwork or Chenille fabric, with a stove, table and double bed.\n\nThe bow-top is commonly thought of as being covered in teal-coloured canvas. This is said to now be a tradition which began before World War II when only cotton duck was available.\n\nAlmost identical in size and construction of the Bow Top wagon, the Open lot or \"Yorkshire Bow\" featured the same design but with a curtain instead of the door characteristic of other wagons. The wagon's entrance was covered by a curtain for privacy.\n\nVardos were elaborately decorated, hand carved and ornately painted with traditional Romani symbols. Examples of famous Wagon Artists responsible for the early development of vardo art are Jim Berry, John Pockett, Tom Stevens, Tommy Gaskin, John Pickett, modern contemporary decorators continuing to shape this colourful tradition included artists such as Yorkie Greenwood and Lol Thompson.\n\nMuch of the wealth of the vardo was on display in the carvings, which incorporated aspects of the Romani lifestyle such as horses and dogs, as well as stock decorative designs of birds, lions, griffins, flowers, vines and elaborate scrollwork. Carved details were often accented with gold, either painted or, in the most expensive wagons, the use of between 4-15 books of gold leaf applied as decoration. Many individual makers were identified by their particular designs.\n\nThe Romanichal funeral rite during the \"wagon time\" of the 19th and 20th century included burning the wagon and belongings after the owner's death. The custom was that nothing whatsoever would have been sold, though some of the deceased's possessions, jewellery, china or money would be left to the family. The rest, including the wagon, was destroyed.\n\nThe Romani travellers in the 1920s proudly clung to their decorative vardos, although the economics of their way of life was in upheaval due to the contraction in the horse-trading industry and the changes from their traditional crafts. In the present day, Romanichals are more likely to live in caravans. The tradition does survive, primarily outside Romani culture. It was estimated that by 1940 only about 1% of Romani travellers still lived in the traditional horse-drawn vardo.\n\nToday's Romanichal still attend horse fairs, the best known of which is Appleby Horse Fair. Some attendees of the fairs travel there in the traditional manner via horse-drawn vardos. American photographer John S. Hockensmith documented such a journey in 2004, travelling with and photographing the Harker family's 60-mile journey to Appleby in bow top living waggons.\n\nThe famous British writer Roald Dahl acquired a traditional vardo in the 1960s which was used as a playhouse for his children; later he used the vardo as a writing room, in which he wrote \"Danny, the Champion of the World\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "165008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165008", "title": "William Gilbert (astronomer)", "text": "William Gilbert (astronomer)\n\nWilliam Gilbert (; 24 May 1544 – 30 November 1603), also known as Gilberd, was an English physician, physicist and natural philosopher. He passionately rejected both the prevailing Aristotelian philosophy and the Scholastic method of university teaching. He is remembered today largely for his book \"De Magnete\" (1600), and is credited as one of the originators of the term \"electricity\". He is regarded by some as the father of electrical engineering or electricity and magnetism.\n\nA unit of magnetomotive force, also known as magnetic potential, was named the \"Gilbert\" in his honour.\n\nGilbert was born in Colchester to Jerome Gilberd, a borough recorder. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. After gaining his MD from Cambridge in 1569, and a short spell as bursar of St John's College, he left to practice medicine in London and travelled on the continent. In 1573, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1600 he was elected President of the College. He was Elizabeth I's own physician from 1601 until her death in 1603, and James VI and I renewed his appointment.\n\nHis primary scientific work—much inspired by earlier works of Robert Norman—was \"De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure\" (\"On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on the Great Magnet the Earth\") published in 1600. In this work, he describes many of his experiments with his model Earth called the terrella. From these experiments, he concluded that the Earth was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses point north (previously, some believed that it was the pole star (Polaris) or a large magnetic island on the north pole that attracted the compass). He was the first to argue, correctly, that the centre of the Earth was iron, and he considered an important and related property of magnets was that they can be cut, each forming a new magnet with north and south poles.\n\nIn , he argues in support of diurnal rotation, though he does not talk about heliocentrism, stating that it is an absurdity to think that the immense celestial spheres (doubting even that they exist) rotate daily, as opposed to the diurnal rotation of the much smaller Earth. He also posits that the \"fixed\" stars are at remote variable distances rather than fixed to an imaginary sphere. He states that situated \"in thinnest aether, or in the most subtle fifth essence, or in vacuity – how shall the stars keep their places in the mighty swirl of these enormous spheres composed of a substance of which no one knows aught?\"\n\nThe English word \"electricity\" was first used in 1646 by Sir Thomas Browne, derived from Gilbert's 1600 New Latin \"electricus\", meaning \"like amber\". The term had been in use since the 13th century, but Gilbert was the first to use it to mean \"like amber in its attractive properties\". He recognized that friction with these objects removed a so-called \"effluvium\", which would cause the attraction effect in returning to the object, though he did not realize that this substance (electric charge) was universal to all materials.\n\nIn his book, he also studied static electricity using amber; amber is called \"elektron\" in Greek, so Gilbert decided to call its effect the \"electric force\". He invented the first electrical measuring instrument, the electroscope, in the form of a pivoted needle he called the \"versorium\".\n\nLike others of his day, he believed that crystal (quartz) was an especially hard form of water, formed from compressed ice:\n\nGilbert argued that electricity and magnetism were not the same thing. For evidence, he (incorrectly) pointed out that, while electrical attraction disappeared with heat, magnetic attraction did not (although it is proven that magnetism does in fact become damaged and weakened with heat). Hans Christian Ørsted and James Clerk Maxwell showed that both effects were aspects of a single force: electromagnetism. Maxwell surmised this in his \"A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism\" after much analysis.\n\nGilbert's magnetism was the invisible force that many other natural philosophers, such as Kepler, seized upon, incorrectly, as governing the motions that they observed. While not attributing magnetism to attraction among the stars, Gilbert pointed out the motion of the skies was due to earth's rotation, and not the rotation of the spheres, 20 years before Galileo (but 57 years after Copernicus who stated it openly in his work \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" published in 1543 ) (see external reference below). Gilbert made the first attempt to map the surface markings on the Moon in the 1590s. His chart, made without the use of a telescope, showed outlines of dark and light patches on the moon's face. Contrary to most of his contemporaries, Gilbert believed that the light spots on the Moon were water, and the dark spots land.\nBesides Gilbert's \"De Magnete\", there appeared at Amsterdam in 1651 a quarto volume of 316 pages entitled \"De Mundo Nostro Sublunari Philosophia Nova\" (New Philosophy about our Sublunary World), edited—some say by his brother William Gilbert Junior, and others say, by the eminent English scholar and critic John Gruter—from two manuscripts found in the library of Sir William Boswell. According to Dr. John Davy, \"this work of Gilbert's, which is so little known, is a very remarkable one both in style and matter; and there is a vigor and energy of expression belonging to it very suitable to its originality. Possessed of a more minute and practical knowledge of natural philosophy than Bacon, his opposition to the philosophy of the schools was more searching and particular, and at the same time probably little less efficient.\" In the opinion of Prof. John Robison, \"De Mundo\" consists of an attempt to establish a new system of natural philosophy upon the ruins of the Aristotelian doctrine.\n\nDr. William Whewell says in his \"History of the Inductive Sciences\" (1859):\nGilbert, in his work, \"De Magnete\" printed in 1600 has only some vague notions that the magnetic virtue of the earth in some way determines the direction of the earth's axis, the rate of its diurnal rotation, and that of the revolution of the moon about it. Gilbert died in 1603, and in his posthumous work (\"De Mundo nostro Sublunari Philosophia nova\", 1631) we have already a more distinct statement of the attraction of one body by another. \"The force which emanates from the moon reaches to the earth, and, in like manner, the magnetic virtue of the earth pervades the region of the moon: both correspond and conspire by the joint action of both, according to a proportion and conformity of motions, but the earth has more effect in consequence of its superior mass; the earth attracts and repels, the moon, and the moon within certain limits, the earth; not so as to make the bodies come together, as magnetic bodies do, but so that they may go on in a continuous course.\" Though this phraseology is capable of representing a good deal of the truth, it does not appear to have been connected... with any very definite notions of mechanical action in detail.\nGilbert died on 30 November 1603 in London. His cause of death is thought to have been the bubonic plague.\n\nGilbert was buried in his home town, in Holy Trinity Church, Colchester. His marble wall monument can still be seen in this Saxon church, now deconsecrated and used as a café and market.\n\nFrancis Bacon never accepted Copernican heliocentrism and was critical of Gilbert's philosophical work in support of the diurnal motion of the earth. Bacon's criticism includes the following two statements. The first was repeated in three of his works—\"In the Advancement of Learning\" (1605), \"Novum Organum\" (1620) and \"De Augmentis\" (1623). The more severe second statement is from \"History of Heavy and Light Bodies\" published after Bacon's death.\nThe Alchemists have made a philosophy out of a few experiments of the furnace and Gilbert our countryman hath made a philosophy out of observations of the lodestone.\n[Gilbert] has himself become a magnet; that is, he has ascribed too many things to that force and built a ship out of a shell. \nThomas Thomson writes in his \"History of the Royal Society\" (1812):\n\nThe magnetic laws were first generalized and explained by Dr. Gilbert, whose book on magnetism published in 1600, is one of the finest examples of inductive philosophy that has ever been presented to the world. It is the more remarkable, because it preceded the \"Novum Organum\" of Bacon, in which the inductive method of philosophizing was first explained.\nWilliam Whewell writes in his \"History of the Inductive Sciences\" (1837/1859):\nGilbert... repeatedly asserts the paramount value of experiments. He himself, no doubt, acted up to his own precepts; for his work contains all the fundamental facts of the science [of magnetism], so fully examined, indeed, that even at this day we have little to add to them.\nHistorian Henry Hallam wrote of Gilbert in his \"Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries\" (1848):\n\nThe year 1600 was the first in which England produced a remarkable work in physical science; but this was one sufficient to raise a lasting reputation to its author. Gilbert, a physician, in his Latin treatise on the magnet, not only collected all the knowledge which others had possessed on that subject, but became at once the father of experimental philosophy in this island, and by a singular felicity and acuteness of genius, the founder of theories which have been revived after the lapse of ages, and are almost universally received into the creed of the science. The magnetism of the earth itself, his own original hypothesis, \"nova illa nostra et inaudita de tellure sententia\" [our new and unprecedented view of the planet]... was by no means one of those vague conjectures that are sometimes unduly applauded... He relied on the analogy of terrestrial phenomena to those exhibited by what he calls a \"terrella\", or artificial spherical magnet. ...Gilbert was also one of our earliest Copernicans, at least as to the rotation of the earth; and with his usual sagacity inferred, before the invention of the telescope, that there are a multitude of fixed stars beyond the reach of our vision.\nWalter William Bryant of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, wrote in his book (1920):\n\nWhen Gilbert of Colchester, in his “New Philosophy,” founded on his researches in magnetism, was dealing with tides, he did not suggest that the moon attracted the water, but that “subterranean spirits and humors, rising in sympathy with the moon, cause the sea also to rise and flow to the shores and up rivers”. It appears that an idea, presented in some such way as this, was more readily received than a plain statement. This so-called philosophical method was, in fact, very generally applied, and Kepler, who shared Galileo’s admiration for Gilbert’s work, adopted it in his own attempt to extend the idea of magnetic attraction to the planets.\n\n\n"}
