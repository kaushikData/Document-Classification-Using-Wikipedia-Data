The waste that will be burned to generate the electricity, will be sourced from several metropolitan and municipal assemblies in the Greater Accra Region. These include Accra, Tema, Ga South Municipal District, Ga East Municipal District, and La Dade Kotopon Municipal District. The Ghana Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development is a collaborator on this development.\n\nThe development of this power station is in response to the unsatisfactory waste-management environment in the Greater Accra area, particularly among the low-income communities. The dangers that these communities face include (a) bio-degraded waste that contains parasites and disease-causing microbes (b) toxic leachate which seeps from landfills into the water table and (c) the toxic emissions from landfill burning.\n\nThe poor environmental sanitation, leads to stagnation of drainage water and the breeding of disease-spreading mosquitoes. In the Greater Accra Area, 3.5 million malaria cases are recorded every year, with 900,000 of them occurring among children of less than five years of age, as of March 2018.\n\nThe power generated will be sold to the Electricity Company of Ghana, for integration into the national electricity grid.\n\nThe power station is being built by \"Armech Africa Limited\". The main contractor is Energy China, with money borrowed from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The construction cost is budgeted at US$300 million. This project represents the first grid-ready waste-to-energy project in the countries of the Economic Community of West African States.

Because of his success in doing this, in 1860 he was commissioned to write a 10-volume zoological encyclopedia. Journeys to Abyssinia, Scandinavia and Siberia both interrupted and enriched the work. The first six volumes of the encyclopedia, published under the title \"Illustrirtes Thierleben\", appeared from 1864 to 1869, published by the Bibliographisches Institut under Herrmann Julius Meyer. Illustrated under the direction of Robert Kretschmer (1818–1872), they met with wide approval from the educated bourgeoisie.\n\nAs of the second edition, which consisted of ten volumes published from 1876 to 1879, the work was already titled \"Brehms Tierleben\". The work made Brehm famous around the world and its title is still a\ncatchphrase today, even though science has gone far beyond Brehm. Perhaps the greatest change in the second edition was the addition of new illustrations by Gustav Mützel, the brothers August and Friedrich Specht and others, which Charles Darwin said were the best he had ever seen.

{"id": "46989741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46989741", "title": "Brown ocean effect", "text": "Brown ocean effect\n\nThe brown ocean effect is an observed weather phenomenon involving tropical cyclones after landfall. They are commonly expected to lose energy when they make landfall, but instead maintain strength or intensify over land surfaces. While these systems are highly common in the United States and China, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) names Australia the most conducive environment after 30 years of research. In Australia, such storm systems are called \"agukabams\".\n\nOne source of the brown ocean effect has been identified as the large amount of latent heat that can be released from extremely wet soils. A 2013 NASA study found that, from 1979-2008, 45 of 227 tropical storms either gained or maintained strength after making landfall. The press release stated, \"The land essentially mimics the moisture-rich environment of the ocean, where the storm originated.\" Originally, research devoted to extratropical cyclones, storms that first derive energy from the warm ocean waters and later from the conjecture of various air masses, explained the intensification of storms after landfall. However, as research into these storms persists, Andersen and Shepherd, the two leading scientists behind the NASA study, discovered that some of these storms were not transitioning from warm-core to cold-core but were actually maintaining their warm-core dynamics, while ultimately outputting a greater measure of rainfall. \n\nIn order for the brown ocean effect to take place, three land conditions must be met: \"First, the lower level of the atmosphere mimics a tropical atmosphere with minimal variation in temperature. Second, soils in the vicinity of the storms need to contain ample moisture. Finally, evaporation of the soil moisture releases latent heat, which the team found must measure at least 70 watts averaged per square meter.\" Storm systems impacted by the brown ocean effect gave rise to a new sub-category of tropical storm type called \"Tropical Cyclone Maintenance and Intensification Event\" or TCMI. Another study concluded that latent surface heat flux from land surfaces actually have the potential to be larger than from the ocean, albeit for brief periods only. Andersen and Shepherd are also examining the effects of climate change on TCMIs, looking into the potential intensification of these storms due to increase or decrease in the degree of wetness and dryness in areas susceptible to these systems.\n\n2001's Tropical Storm Allison spent a dozen days in June meandering slowly across the Southeastern United States from Texas to the Carolinas, generating torrential rains and looking much healthier over land than it would over the ocean prior to landfall and subsequent of departure.\n\nTropical Storm Erin of 2007 is an example of the effect, when the storm intensified over central Texas, eventually forming an eye over Oklahoma. Tropical Storm Erin gained even more traction as it travelled across the plains, a rare feat as most tropical storms weaken as they go farther inland. Andersen states \"Until events like Erin in 2007, there was not much focus on post-landfall tropical cyclones unless they transitioned. Erin really brought attention to the inland intensification of tropical cyclones.\"\n\nTropical Storm Fay (2008) upon landfall over the Florida mainland strengthened to near hurricane strength and briefly forming an eye-like feature before weakening. The cause of this was the waterlogged terrain of South Florida specifically Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades.\n\nAnother possible case is Tropical Storm Bill of 2015, when saturated soil conditions sustained the system for a longer period of time.\n\nIn 2016, Tropical Depression Eleven made landfall in Eastern Florida. While over land, it became the first tropical cyclone to reach tropical storm strength while over Florida, where it was named \"Julia\".\n\nOne possible case in the southern hemisphere is Tropical Cyclone Kelvin in 2018. Shortly after making landfall over Western Australia, Kelvin developed a clear eye and continued strengthening despite moving over the Great Sandy Desert, where most tropical cyclones rapidly weaken.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto of 2018 is another example of the brown ocean effect. The storm sustained it's strength as a Tropical Depression after landfall, lasting for an additional three days after its landfall. Alberto became one of only eleven cyclones to reach Lake Huron as a tropical depression.\n"}

Rode and co-workers at the Australian National University in Canberra. It consists of a cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web. The material is extremely light, with a density of 2–10 mg/cm (0.0012 lb/ft). A gallon of nanofoam weighs about a quarter of an ounce.\n\nEach cluster is about 6 nanometers wide and consists of about 4000 carbon atoms linked in graphite-like sheets that are given negative curvature by the inclusion of heptagons among the regular hexagonal pattern. This is the opposite of what happens in the case of buckminsterfullerenes, in which carbon sheets are given positive curvature by the inclusion of pentagons.\n\nThe large-scale structure of carbon nanofoam is similar to that of an aerogel, but with 1% of the density of previously produced carbon aerogels—or only a few times the density of air at sea level. Unlike carbon aerogels, carbon nanofoam is a poor electrical conductor. The nanofoam contains numerous unpaired electrons, which Rode and colleagues propose is due to carbon atoms with only three bonds that are found at topological and bonding defects. This gives rise to what is perhaps carbon nanofoam's most unusual feature: it is attracted to magnets, and below −183 °C can itself be made magnetic.\n\n"}

The weather was inclement with rain and fog when the aircraft approached Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, so the pilot executed a missed approach. After the jet was cleared to land at runway 05L, the autopilot was disengaged, and the pilots then attempted a manual go-around. The jet slowed down, pitched up by 40 degrees, rose 1,000 feet (300 m), stalled, and crashed into a residential neighborhood, bursting into flames at local time 4:20 PM. All 196 people on board were killed (including the governor of Taiwan's central bank, Sheu Yuan-dong, his wife, Huang Mian-mei, and three central bank officials), along with seven people on the ground. Hsu Lu, the manager of the Voice of Taipei radio station, said that one boy was pulled alive from the wreckage and later died.\n\nIt remains the deadliest aviation accident on Taiwanese soil and the fifth-deadliest involving an Airbus A300. China Airlines had twelve A300s in its fleet at the time of the accident. It is also the second deadliest accident overall in Taiwan's history, behind China Airlines Flight 611, a Boeing 747-209B which crashed in the Taiwan Strait with 225 fatalities.\n\nThe aircraft involved in the accident was an Airbus A300B4-622R, registration It was delivered to China Airlines on 14 December 1990 and was powered by 2x Pratt and Whitney PW4156 engines. The aircraft was 7.3 years old at the time of the accident and had completed 20,193 flight hours. Captain Kang Long-Lin, who was 49 years old, joined China Airlines in 1990, and had 7,210 hours total flight time. First Officer Jiang Der-Sheng who was 44 years old, joined China Airlines in 1996, and had 3,530 hours total flight time. Both pilots were formerly with the Republic of China Air Force. The flight consisted of 189 Taiwanese nationals, along with 5 Americans, one French, and one Indonesian.\n\nThe plane took off from Ngurah Rai Int'l Airport, Bali, Indonesia en route to Chiang Kai-Shek Int'l Airport, Taipei, Taiwan with 182 passengers and 14 crew at 15:27.\n\nThe Airbus carried out an ILS/DME approach to runway 05L at Taipei Chiang Kai Shek Airport in light rain and fog but came in 1,000 feet too high above the glide slope (at 1,515 feet, 1.2 nm short of the threshold). Go around power was applied 19 seconds later over the threshold (at a 1,475 feet agl). The landing gear was raised and the flaps set to 20deg as the Airbus climbed through 1,723 feet in a 35-deg pitch-up.\n\nReaching 2,751 feet (42.7 deg pitch-up, 45 knots speed) the A300 stalled. Control could not be regained as the aircraft fell and smashed into the ground 200 feet left off the runway. It then surged forward, hit a utility pole and a highway median and skidded into several houses, surrounded by fish farms, rice paddies, factories and warehouses, and exploded, killing all on board.\n\nWeather was 2,400 feet visibility, RVR runway 05L of 3,900 feet, 300 feet broken ceiling, 3,000 feet overcast. According to the CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder), the last words were from the First Officer and were \"Pull up, too low!\" This was surrounded by the Terrain alarm and stall warnings.\n\nOn initial approach to land, the aircraft was more than 300 meters above its normal altitude when it was only six nautical miles away from the airport. Nonetheless it continued the approach. Only when approaching the runway threshold, a go around was initiated. During this time, the pilot had unknowingly disengaged the plane's autopilot but was not aware of it. During the go around he therefore did nothing to actively take control of the plane as he thought the autopilot would initiate the maneuver. For 11 seconds, the plane was under no one's control.\n\nFollowing a formal investigation that had continued for nearly two years, a final report by a special task force under the Civil Aviation Administration concluded that pilot error was behind the crash of Flight 676. The report concludes by pointing the finger at China Airlines for what it calls \"insufficient training\" and \"poor management of the resources in the pilot's cabin\".\n\nThe cockpit voice recording was leaked on the Internet, but has been removed as it is a property of the Taiwanese government.\n\nThe person speaking is listed in bold.\n\n\n12:04:26 TWR Clear to land.

{"id": "8562026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8562026", "title": "Electroluminescent wire", "text": "Electroluminescent wire\n\nElectroluminescent wire (often abbreviated as EL wire) is a thin copper wire coated in a phosphor which glows when an alternating current is applied to it. It can be used in a wide variety of applications—vehicle and structure decoration, safety and emergency lighting, toys, clothing etc.—much as rope light or Christmas lights are often used. Unlike these types of strand lights, EL wire is not a series of points, but produces a 360 degree unbroken line of visible light. Its thin diameter makes it flexible and ideal for use in a variety of applications such as clothing or costumes.\n\nEL wire's construction consists of five major components. First is a solid-copper wire core coated with phosphor. A very fine wire or pair of wires is spiral-wound around the phosphor-coated copper core and then the outer ITO conductive coating is evaporated on. This fine wire is electrically isolated from the copper core. Surrounding this \"sandwich\" of copper core, phosphor and fine copper wire is a clear PVC sleeve. Finally, surrounding this thin and clear PVC sleeve is another clear, colored translucent or fluorescent PVC sleeve.\nAn alternating current electric potential of approximately 90 to 120 volts at about 1000 Hz is applied between the copper core wire and the fine wire that surrounds the copper core. The wire can be modeled as a coaxial capacitor with about 1 nF of capacitance per foot, and the rapid charging and discharging of this capacitor excites the phosphor to emit light. The colors of light that can be produced efficiently by phosphors are limited, so many types of wire use an additional fluorescent organic dye in the clear PVC sleeve to produce the final result. These organic dyes produce colors like red and purple when excited by the blue-green light of the core.\n\nA resonant oscillator is typically used to generate the high voltage drive signal. Because of the capacitance load of the EL wire, using an inductive (coiled) transformer makes the driver a very efficient tuned LC oscillator. The efficiency of EL wire is very high, and thus up to a hundred meters of EL wire can be driven by AA batteries for several hours.\n\nIn recent years, the LC circuit has been replaced for some applications with a single chip switched capacitor inverter IC such as the Supertex HV850; this can run 30cm of angel hair wire at high efficiency, and is suitable for solar lanterns and safety applications. The other advantage of these chips is that the control signals can be derived from a microcontroller, so brightness and colour can vary depending on battery state or ambient temperature.\n\nEL wire - in common with other types of EL devices - does have limitations: at high frequency it dissipates a lot of heat, and that can lead to breakdown and loss of brightness over time. Because the wire is unshielded and typically operates at a relatively high voltage, EL wire can produce high-frequency interference (corresponding to the frequency of the oscillator) that can be picked up by sensitive audio equipment, such as guitar pickups. \nThere is also a voltage limit: typical EL wire breaks down at around 180V p-p, so if using an unregulated transformer back to back, zeners and series current limiting resistors are essential.\n\nIn addition, EL sheet and wire can sometimes be used as a touch sensor, since compressing the capacitor will change its value.\n\nEL wire sequencers can flash electroluminescent wire, or \"EL wire,\" in sequential patterns. EL wire requires a low-power, high-frequency \"driver\" to cause the wire to illuminate. Most EL wire drivers simply light up one strand of EL wire in a constant-on mode, and some drivers may additionally have a blink or strobe mode. A sound-activated driver will light EL wire in synchronization to music, speech, or other ambient sound, but an EL wire sequencer will allow multiple lengths of EL wire to be flashed in a desired sequence. The lengths of EL wire can all be the same color, or a variety of colors.\n\nThe images above show a sign that displays a telephone number, where the numbers were formed using different colors of EL wire. There are ten numbers, each of which is connected to a different channel of the EL wire sequencer.\n\nLike EL wire drivers, sequencers are rated to drive (or power) a range or specific length of EL wire. For example, using a sequencer rated for 1.5 to 14 meters (5 to 45 feet), if less than 1.5m is used, there is a risk of burning out the sequencer, and if more than 14m is used, the EL wire will not light as brightly as intended.\n\nThere are commercially available EL wire sequencers capable of lighting three, four, five, or ten lengths of EL wire. There are professional and experimental sequencers with many more than ten channels, but for most applications, ten channels is enough. Sequencers usually have options for changing the speed, reversing, changing the order of the sequence, and sometimes, to change whether the first wires remain lit or go off as the rest of the wires in the sequence are lit. EL wire sequencers tend to be smaller than a pack of cigarettes and most are powered by batteries. This versatility lends to the sequencers' use at nighttime events where mains electricity is not available.\n\nBy arranging each strand of EL wire into a shape slightly different from the previous one, it is possible to create animations using EL wire sequencers. EL wire sequencers are also used for costumes and have been used to create animations on various items such as kimonos, purses, neckties, and motorcycle tanks. They are increasingly popular among artists, dancers, maker culture, and similar creative communities, such as exhibited in the annual Burning Man alt-culture festival.\n\n5,753,381 US Patent, Electroluminescent Filament\n\n"}

{"id": "9568579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9568579", "title": "Fatty acid synthesis", "text": "Fatty acid synthesis\n\nFatty acid synthesis is the creation of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and NADPH through the action of enzymes called fatty acid synthases. This process takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. Most of the acetyl-CoA which is converted into fatty acids is derived from carbohydrates via the glycolytic pathway. The glycolytic pathway also provides the glycerol with which three fatty acids can combine (by means of ester bonds) to form triglycerides (also known as \"triacylglycerols\" – to distinguish them from fatty \"acids\" – or simply as \"fat\"), the final product of the lipogenic process. When only two fatty acids combine with glycerol and the third alcohol group is phosphorylated with a group such as phosphatidylcholine, a phospholipid is formed. Phospholipids form the bulk of the lipid bilayers that make up cell membranes and surround the organelles within the cells (e.g. the cell nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus etc.)\n\nStraight-chain fatty acids occur in two types: saturated and unsaturated.\n\nMuch like β-oxidation, straight-chain fatty acid synthesis occurs via the six recurring reactions shown below, until the 16-carbon palmitic acid is produced.\n\nThe diagrams presented show how fatty acids are synthesized in microorganisms and list the enzymes found in \"Escherichia coli\". These reactions are performed by fatty acid synthase II (FASII), which in general contain multiple enzymes that act as one complex. FASII is present in prokaryotes, plants, fungi, and parasites, as well as in mitochondria.\n\nIn animals, as well as some fungi such as yeast, these same reactions occur on fatty acid synthase I (FASI), a large dimeric protein that has all of the enzymatic activities required to create a fatty acid. FASI is less efficient than FASII; however, it allows for the formation of more molecules, including \"medium-chain\" fatty acids via early chain termination.\n\nOnce a 16:0 carbon fatty acid has been formed, it can undergo a number of modifications, resulting in desaturation and/or elongation. Elongation, starting with stearate (18:0), is performed mainly in the ER by several membrane-bound enzymes. The enzymatic steps involved in the elongation process are principally the same as those carried out by FAS, but the four principal successive steps of the elongation are performed by individual proteins, which may be physically associated.\n\nNote that during fatty synthesis the reducing agent is NADPH, whereas NAD is the oxidizing agent in beta-oxidation (the breakdown of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA). This difference exemplifies a general principle that NADPH is consumed during biosynthetic reactions, whereas NADH is generated in energy-yielding reactions. (Thus NADPH is also required for the synthesis of cholesterol from acetyl-CoA; while NADH is generated during glycolysis.) The source of the NADPH is two-fold. When malate is oxidatively decarboxylated by \"NADP-linked malic enzyme\" to form pyruvate, CO and NADPH are formed. NADPH is also formed by the pentose phosphate pathway which converts glucose into ribose, which can be used in synthesis of nucleotides and nucleic acids, or it can be catabolized to pyruvate.\n\nIn humans, fatty acids are formed from carbohydrates predominantly in the liver and adipose tissue, as well as in the mammary glands during lactation.\n\nThe pyruvate produced by glycolysis is an important intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol. This occurs via the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, this acetyl CoA needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate (produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate) is removed from the citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate can be used for gluconeogenesis (in the liver), or it can be returned into mitochondrion as malate. The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by acetyl CoA carboxylase into malonyl CoA, the first committed step in the synthesis of fatty acids.\n\nThe main fuel stored in the bodies of animals is fat. The young adult human's fat stores average between about 10–20 kg, but varies greatly depending on age, gender, and individual disposition. By contrast the human body stores only about 400 g of glycogen, of which 300 g is locked inside the skeletal muscles and is unavailable to the body as a whole. The 100 g or so of glycogen stored in the liver is depleted within one day of starvation. Thereafter the glucose that is released into the blood by the liver for general use by the body tissues, has to be synthesized from the glucogenic amino acids and a few other gluconeogenic substrates, which do not include fatty acids.\n\nFatty acids are broken down to acetyl-CoA by means of beta oxidation inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondrion, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate decarboxylation reaction is irreversible. Instead it condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. This is the only substance that can be removed from the mitochondrion to enter the gluconeogenic pathway to form glucose or glycogen in the liver or any other tissue. There can therefore be no net conversion of fatty acids into glucose.\n\nOnly plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose.\n\nRegulation\n\nAcetyl-CoA is formed into malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, at which point malonyl-CoA is destined to feed into the fatty acid synthesis pathway. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the point of regulation in saturated straight-chain fatty acid synthesis, and is subject to both phosphorylation and allosteric regulation. Regulation by phosphorylation occurs mostly in mammals, while allosteric regulation occurs in most organisms. Allosteric control occurs as feedback inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA and activation by citrate. When there are high levels of palmitoyl-CoA, the final product of saturated fatty acid synthesis, it allosterically inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to prevent a build-up of fatty acids in cells. Citrate acts to activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase under high levels, because high levels indicate that there is enough acetyl-CoA to feed into the Krebs cycle and conserve energy.\n\nHigh plasma levels of insulin in the blood plasma (e.g. after meals) cause the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thus promoting the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, and consequently the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids, while epinephrine and glucagon (released into the blood during starvation and exercise) cause the phosphorylation of this enzyme, inhibiting lipogenesis in favor of fatty acid oxidation via beta-oxidation.\n\nMany bacteria use the anaerobic pathway for synthesizing unsaturated fatty acids. This pathway does not utilize oxygen and is dependent on enzymes to insert the double bond before elongation utilizing the normal fatty acid synthesis machinery. In \"Escherichia coli\", this pathway is well understood.\n\n\nMost bacteria that undergo anaerobic desaturation contain homologues of FabA and FabB. Clostridia are the main exception; they have a novel enzyme, yet to be identified, that catalyzes the formation of the cis double bond.\n\nRegulation\n\nThis pathway undergoes transcriptional regulation by FadR and FabR. FadR is the more extensively studied protein and has been attributed bifunctional characteristics. It acts as an activator of \"fabA\" and \"fabB\" transcription and as a repressor for the β-oxidation regulon. In contrast, FabR acts as a repressor for the transcription of fabA and fabB.\n\nAerobic desaturation is the most widespread pathway for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. It is utilized in all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes. This pathway utilizes desaturases to synthesize unsaturated fatty acids from full-length saturated fatty acid substrates. All desaturases require oxygen and ultimately consume NADH even though desaturation is an oxidative process. Desaturases are specific for the double bond they induce in the substrate. In Bacillus subtilis, the desaturase, Δ-Des, is specific for inducing a cis-double bond at the Δ position. \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" contains one desaturase, Ole1p, which induces the cis-double bond at Δ.\n\nIn mammals the aerobic desaturation is catalyzed by a complex of three membrane-bound enzymes (\"NADH-cytochrome b reductase, cytochrome b\", and a \"desaturase\"). These enzymes allow molecular oxygen, O, to interact with the saturated fatty acyl-CoA chain, forming a double bond and two molecules of water, HO. Two electrons come from NADH + H and two from the single bond in the fatty acid chain. These mammalian enzymes are, however, incapable of introducing double bonds at carbon atoms beyond C-9 in the fatty acid chain..) Hence mammals cannot synthesize linoleate or linolenate (which have double bonds at the C-12 (= Δ), or the C-12 and C-15 (= Δ and Δ) positions, respectively, as well as at the Δ position), nor the polyunsaturated, 20-carbon arachidonic acid that is derived from linoleate. These are all termed essential fatty acids, meaning that they are required by the organism, but can only be supplied via the diet. (Arachidonic acid is the precursor the prostaglandins which fulfill a wide variety of functions as local hormones.)\n\nRegulation\n\nIn \"B. subtilis\", this pathway is regulated by a two-component system: DesK and DesR. DesK is a membrane-associated kinase and DesR is a transcriptional regulator of the \"des\" gene. The regulation responds to temperature; when there is a drop in temperature, this gene is upregulated. Unsaturated fatty acids increase the fluidity of the membrane and stabilize it under lower temperatures. DesK is the sensor protein that, when there is a decrease in temperature, will autophosphorylate. DesK-P will transfer its phosphoryl group to DesR. Two DesR-P proteins will dimerize and bind to the DNA promoters of the \"des\" gene and recruit RNA polymerase to begin transcription.\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nIn general, both anaerobic and aerobic unsaturated fatty acid synthesis will not occur within the same system, however \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" and \"Vibrio\" ABE-1 are exceptions.\nWhile \"P. aeruginosa\" undergoes primarily anaerobic desaturation, it also undergoes two aerobic pathways. One pathway utilizes a Δ-desaturase (DesA) that catalyzes a double bond formation in membrane lipids. Another pathway uses two proteins, DesC and DesB, together to act as a Δ-desaturase, which inserts a double bond into a saturated fatty acid-CoA molecule. This second pathway is regulated by repressor protein DesT. DesT is also a repressor of \"fabAB\" expression for anaerobic desaturation when in presence of exogenous unsaturated fatty acids. This functions to coordinate the expression of the two pathways within the organism.\n\nBranched-chain fatty acids are usually saturated and are found in two distinct families: the iso-series and anteiso-series. It has been found that Actinomycetales contain unique branch-chain fatty acid synthesis mechanisms, including that which forms tuberculosteric acid.\n\nThe branched-chain fatty acid synthesizing system uses α-keto acids as primers. This system is distinct from the branched-chain fatty acid synthetase that utilizes short-chain acyl-CoA esters as primers. α-Keto acid primers are derived from the transamination and decarboxylation of valine, leucine, and isoleucine to form 2-methylpropanyl-CoA, 3-methylbutyryl-CoA, and 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively. 2-Methylpropanyl-CoA primers derived from valine are elongated to produce even-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 14-methyl-pentadecanoic (isopalmitic) acid, and 3-methylbutyryl-CoA primers from leucine may be used to form odd-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 13-methyl-tetradecanoic acid. 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA primers from isoleucine are elongated to form anteiso-series fatty acids containing an odd number of carbon atoms such as 12-Methyl tetradecanoic acid. Decarboxylation of the primer precursors occurs through the branched-chain α-keto acid decarboxylase (BCKA) enzyme. Elongation of the fatty acid follows the same biosynthetic pathway in \"Escherichia coli\" used to produce straight-chain fatty acids where malonyl-CoA is used as a chain extender. The major end products are 12–17 carbon branched-chain fatty acids and their composition tends to be uniform and characteristic for many bacterial species.\n\nBCKA decarboxylase and relative activities of α-keto acid substrates\n\nThe BCKA decarboxylase enzyme is composed of two subunits in a tetrameric structure (AB) and is essential for the synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids. It is responsible for the decarboxylation of α-keto acids formed by the transamination of valine, leucine, and isoleucine and produces the primers used for branched-chain fatty acid synthesis. The activity of this enzyme is much higher with branched-chain α-keto acid substrates than with straight-chain substrates, and in Bacillus species its specificity is highest for the isoleucine-derived α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid, followed by α-ketoisocaproate and α-ketoisovalerate. The enzyme's high affinity toward branched-chain α-keto acids allows it to function as the primer donating system for branched-chain fatty acid synthetase.\nFactors affecting chain length and pattern distribution\n\nα-Keto acid primers are used to produce branched-chain fatty acids that, in general, are between 12 and 17 carbons in length. The proportions of these branched-chain fatty acids tend to be uniform and consistent among a particular bacterial species but may be altered due to changes in malonyl-CoA concentration, temperature, or heat-stable factors (HSF) present. All of these factors may affect chain length, and HSFs have been demonstrated to alter the specificity of BCKA decarboxylase for a particular α-keto acid substrate, thus shifting the ratio of branched-chain fatty acids produced. An increase in malonyl-CoA concentration has been shown to result in a larger proportion of C17 fatty acids produced, up until the optimal concentration (≈20μM) of malonyl-CoA is reached. Decreased temperatures also tend to shift the fatty-acid distribution slightly toward C17 fatty-acids in \"Bacillus\" species.\n\nThis system functions similarly to the branch-chain fatty acid synthesizing system, however it uses short-chain carboxylic acids as primers instead of alpha-keto acids. In general, this method is used by bacteria that do not have the ability to perform the branch-chain fatty acid system using alpha-keto primers. Typical short-chain primers include isovalerate, isobutyrate, and 2-methyl butyrate. In general, the acids needed for these primers are taken up from the environment; this is often seen in ruminal bacteria.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n\nThe difference between (straight-chain) fatty acid synthase and branch-chain fatty acid synthase is substrate specificity of the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of acyl-CoA to acyl-ACP.\n\nOmega-alicyclic fatty acids typically contain an omega-terminal propyl or butyryl cyclic group and are some of the major membrane fatty acids found in several species of bacteria. The fatty acid synthetase used to produce omega-alicyclic fatty acids is also used to produce membrane branched-chain fatty acids. In bacteria with membranes composed mainly of omega-alicyclic fatty acids, the supply of cyclic carboxylic acid-CoA esters is much greater than that of branched-chain primers. The synthesis of cyclic primers is not well understood but it has been suggested that mechanism involves the conversion of sugars to shikimic acid which is then converted to cyclohexylcarboxylic acid-CoA esters that serve as primers for omega-alicyclic fatty acid synthesis\n\nTuberculostearic acid (-10-Methylstearic acid) is a saturated fatty acid that is known to be produced by Mycobacterium spp. and two species of \"Streptomyces\". It is formed from the precursor oleic acid (a monounsaturated fatty acid). After oleic acid is esterified to a phospholipid, S-adenosyl-methionine donates a methyl group to the double bond of oleic acid. This methylation reaction forms the intermediate 10-methylene-octadecanoyal. Successive reduction of the residue, with NADPH as a cofactor, results in 10-methylstearic acid\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41620938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41620938", "title": "Geometric separator", "text": "Geometric separator\n\nA geometric separator is a line (or other shape) that partitions a collection of geometric shapes into two subsets, such that proportion of shapes in each subset is bounded, and the number of shapes that do not belong to any subset (i.e. the shapes intersected by the separator itself) is small.\n\nWhen a geometric separator exists, it can be used for building divide-and-conquer algorithms for solving various problems in computational geometry.\n\nA simple case in which a separator is guaranteed to exist is the following:\n\nThus, \"R\" is a geometric separator that separates the \"n\" squares into two subset (\"inside \"R\"\" and \"outside \"R\"\"), with a relatively small \"loss\" (the squares intersected by R are considered \"lost\" because they do not belong to any of the two subsets).\n\nDefine a \"2-fat rectangle\" as an axis-parallel rectangle with an aspect ratio of at most 2.\n\nLet \"R\" be a minimal-area 2-fat rectangle that contains the centers of at least \"n\"/3 squares. Thus every 2-fat rectangle smaller than \"R\" contains fewer than \"n\"/3 squares.\n\nFor every \"t\" in [0,1), let \"R\" be a 2-fat rectangle with the same center as \"R\", inflated by 1 + \"t\".\n\nNow it remains to show that there is a \"t\" for which \"R\" intersects at most O(sqrt(\"n\")) squares.\n\nFirst, consider all the \"large squares\" – the squares whose side-length is at least formula_1. For every \"t\", the perimeter of \"R\" is at most 2·perimeter(\"R\") which is at most 6·width(\"R\"), so it can intersect at most formula_2 large squares.\n\nNext, consider all the \"small squares\" – the squares whose side-length is less than formula_1.\n\nFor every \"t\", define: intersect(\"t\") as the set of small squares intersected by the boundary of \"R\". For every \"t\" and \"t\", if formula_4, then formula_5. Therefore there is a gap of at least formula_1 between the boundary of \"R\" and the boundary of \"R\". Therefore, intersect(\"t\") and intersect(\"t\") are disjoint. Therefore:\n\nTherefore by the pigeonhole principle there is a certain \"j\" for which:\n\nThe separator we look for is the rectangle \"R\", where formula_9.\n\nUsing this separator theorem, we can solve certain problems in computational geometry in the following way:\n\n\nThe above theorem can be generalized in many different ways, with possibly different constants. For example:\n\n\nThe ratio of 1:2, in the square separator theorem above, is the best that can be guaranteed: there are collections of shapes that cannot be separated in a better ratio using a separator that crosses only O(sqrt(\"n\")) shapes. Here is one such collection (from theorem 34 of ):\n\nConsider an equilateral triangle. At each of its 3 vertices, put \"N\"/3 shapes arranged in an exponential spiral, such that the diameter increases by a constant factor every turn of the spiral, and each shape touches its neighbours in the spiral ordering. For example, start with a 1-by-Φ rectangle, where Φ is the golden ratio. Add an adjacent Φ-by-Φ square and get another golden rectangle. Add an adjacent (1+Φ)-by-(1+Φ) square and get a larger golden rectangle, and so on.\n\nNow, in order to separate more than 1/3 of the shapes, the separator must separate O(\"N\") shapes from two different vertices. But to do this, the separator must intersect O(\"N\") shapes.\n\nDefine \"W\" as the most western vertical line with at least \"N\"/4 rectangles entirely to its west. There are two cases:\n\nThe number of intersected shapes, guaranteed by the above theorem, is O(\"N\"). This upper bound is asymptotically tight even when the shapes are squares, as illustrated in the figure to the right. This is in sharp contrast to the upper bound of O() intersected shapes, which is guaranteed when the separator is a closed shape (see previous section).\nMoreover, when the shapes are arbitrary rectangles, there are cases in which no line that separates more than a single rectangle can cross less than \"N\"/4 rectangles, as illustrated in the figure to the right.\n\nThe above theorem can be generalized from disjoint rectangles to \"k\"-thick rectangles. Additionally, by induction on \"d\", it is possible to generalize the above theorem to d dimensions and get the following theorem:\n\nFor the special case when \"k\" = \"N\" − 1 (i.e. each point is contained in at most \"N\" − 1 \nboxes), the following theorem holds:\n\nThe objects need not be boxes, and the separators need not be axis-parallel:\n\nIt is possible to find the hyperplanes guaranteed by the above theorems in O(\"Nd\") steps. Also, if the 2\"d\" lists of the lower and upper endpoints of the intervals defining the boxes's \"i\"th coordinates are pre-sorted, then the best such hyperplane (according to a wide variety of optimality measures) may be found in O(\"Nd\") steps.\n\nDefine the \"centerpoint\" of \"Q\" as a point \"o\" such that every line through it has at most 2\"n\"/3 points of \"Q\" in each side of it. The existence of a centerpoint can be proved using Helly's theorem.\n\nFor a given point \"p\" and constant \"a\">0, define \"Pr(a,p,o)\" as the probability that a random line through \"o\" lies at a distance of less than \"a\" from \"p\". The idea is to bound this probability and thus bound the expected number of points at a distance less than \"a\" from a random line through \"o\". Then, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one line through \"o\" is the desired separator.\n\nBounded-width separators can be used for approximately solving the protein folding problem. It can also be used for an exact sub-exponential algorithm to find a maximum independent set, as well as several related covering problems, in geometric graphs.\n\nThe planar separator theorem may be proven by using the circle packing theorem to represent a planar graph as the contact graph of a system of disks in the plane, and then by finding a circle that forms a geometric separator for those disks.\n\n"}

Among other uses, Nappa leather is often used in leather products such as furniture, clothing, handbags, and shoes. As the term is used today, Nappa leather may be either natural grain, or more likely, corrected grain.\n\nNappa leather was first 'coined' by Emanuel Manasse in 1875 while working for the Sawyer Tanning Company in Napa, California.\n\nNappa tannage in the \"strict sense\", but a term no longer used in this framework, refers to a tannage consisting of alum salts with vegetable tanning agents.\n\nNapa leather is defined in Merriam-Webster's dictionary.\n\n\n"}

A single entity, it has authority and reporting responsibilities within both the United States Department of the Navy (NAVSEA, Chief of Naval Operations) and the United States Department of Energy (National Nuclear Security Administration).\n\nProgram responsibilities are delineated in Presidential Executive Order 12344 of February 1, 1982, and prescribed by Public Laws 98-525 of October 19, 1984 (42 USC 7158), and 106-65 of October 5, 1999 (50 USC 2406).\n\nSoon after his U.S. Navy service during World War II, Captain (later Admiral) Hyman G. Rickover became an early advocate of nuclear marine propulsion. Assigned to the Bureau of Ships in September 1947, Rickover received training in nuclear power at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and worked with the Bureau to explore the possibility of nuclear ship propulsion. In February 1949 he received an assignment to the Division of Reactor Development, United States Atomic Energy Commission and then assumed control of the Navy's effort as Director of the Naval Reactors Branch in the Bureau of Ships.\n\nThe office was originally a joint activity of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships. When the AEC was abolished, Naval Reactors became a joint effort of the Navy and the Energy Research and Development Administration, which partly replaced the AEC. In 1977, ERDA was combined with the Federal Energy Administration to form the U.S. Department of Energy. On the Navy side of the organization, the Bureau of Ships has transitioned since the 1950s to become the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), within which NR is Code 08, usually abbreviated NAVSEA 08 or SEA 08.\n\nWithin seven years of its inception, the organization that developed from this concept would put into operation the nation's first power reactor (the \"Nautilus\" prototype). The following four years would see three more nuclear submarines and two reactor plant prototypes operating and another seven ships and two prototypes being built. To date, more reactors have been built and safely operated by the NR program than any other US program.\n\nHyman G. Rickover parlayed an impressive personal publicity effort and intensive links with the United States Congress into an unprecedented tenure situation as head of Naval Reactors whereby he could not be relieved by conventional military procedures. He was promoted successively, partially as a result of Congressional involvement, until he reached the rank of full Admiral and held the position for over 30 years from 1949 to February 1, 1982 (when he was retired). \n\nThe Director of Naval Reactors also serves as a Deputy Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\nMany books (including those referenced below) and articles have been written about core NR management principles such as attention to detail and adherence to rigidly-defined standards and specifications, as well as the organization's unique (for government) personnel practices. NR staff and alumni (including Admiral Rickover himself) have often been called by Congress, the President and other government agencies to provide expert opinion and management support to other important government programs, most notably the large scale reviews following the destruction of the Space Shuttles \"Columbia\" and \"Challenger\". NR alumni have also founded or led numerous corporate and industrial organizations, for example MPR Associates, Inc. , founded by three of Admiral Rickover's leading technical managers in NR's early days.\n\n"}

It is the largest state public power organization in the United States. NYPA provides some of the lowest-cost electricity in the nation, operating 16 generating facilities and more than 1,400 circuit-miles of transmission lines. Its main administrative offices are in White Plains.\n\nNYPA uses no state tax dollars and incurs no state debt, financing its projects principally through the sale of bonds. The bonds are repaid and the projects operated using revenues from operations.\n\nState and federal regulations determine NYPA’s customer base, which includes large and small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, public power systems and government agencies. NYPA also sells electricity to private utilities for resale (without profit) to their customers, and to neighboring states, under federal requirements. Approximately 70 percent of the electricity NYPA produces is clean renewable hydropower. Its lower-cost power production and electricity purchases support hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout New York State.\n\nThe New York Power Authority has been financially responsible for the New York State Canal Corporation since April 2016 and has owned it since January 1, 2017.\n\n“Power the economic growth and competitiveness of New York State by providing customers with low-cost, clean, reliable power and the innovative energy infrastructure and services they value.”\n\nSince 2011, the President and Chief Executive Officer has been Gil C. Quiniones. The executive staff report to a 7-member board. In 2017, it had operating expenses of $2.335 billion, an outstanding debt of $1.305 billion, and a staffing level of 2,327 people.\n\nElectric power produced from NYPA's facilities - in addition to being sold to large and small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, public power systems, government agencies, private utilities for resale (without profit) to their customers, and neighboring states, under federal requirements - is sold into the wholesale electricity market of New York State, which is administered by the NYISO. A larger direct sales customer of electric power is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. NYPA also provides electrical engineering consulting services to the MTA when the MTA is planning for and building new power facilities. \n\nNYPA operates three large hydroelectric complexes: the 2,441-megawatt (MW) Niagara Power Project, on the Niagara River in Lewiston; the 800-MW St. Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project, on the St. Lawrence River in Massena; and the 1,160-MW Blenheim-Gilboa Pumped Storage Power Project in the Catskill Mountain towns of North Blenheim and Gilboa.\n\nNYPA also has four small hydro facilities with a net capability of 10-MW: the Ashokan Project in Ulster County, the Crescent Plant in Albany and Saratoga counties, the Gregory B. Jarvis Plant in Oneida County and the Vischer Ferry Plant in Schenectady and Saratoga counties.\n\nOther generating facilities include two highly efficient natural gas-fueled power plants: the 135-MW Richard M. Flynn Power Plant, in Holtsville, Long Island and a 500-MW facility, in Astoria, Queens.\n\nAdditionally, NYPA operates seven small, clean power plants also fueled by natural gas. Those units – six in New York City and one on Long Island – combine for 461-MW.\n\nThe hub of NYPA’s statewide power transmission facilities is the Frederick R. Clark Energy Center, in Marcy, New York. NYPA’s high-voltage transmission assets include a 765-kilovolt (kV) line that stretches more than 100 miles from the Canada–US border to the Clark Energy Center and almost 1,000 miles of 345-kV power lines that crisscross New York State, including the Marcy South line and a transmission project, that follows an underground and underwater path from Westchester County to Long Island.\n\nThe New York Power Authority has been financially responsible for the New York State Canal Corporation since April 2016 and has owned it since January 1, 2017.\n\nGovernor Roosevelt signed the Power Authority Act into law on April 27, 1931.\n\nSt. Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project\nThe International Joint Commission granted its approval for a cross-border construction project in 1952. In 1953, the Federal Power Commission issued a license for NYPA to develop the U.S. portion of a power dam crossing the Canada–US border. On May 13, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed legislation that cleared the way for construction of both a hydroelectric facility and the St. Lawrence Seaway.\nFirst power was achieved in July 1958, and on June 27, 1959, Queen Elizabeth II and Vice President Richard M. Nixon formally dedicated the St. Lawrence Project as a symbol of international cooperation. In 1981, NYPA’s half of the cross-border power dam was renamed the St. Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project in honor of the man who founded the Power Authority half a century earlier.\n\nNiagara Power Project\nIn 1956, a rock slide destroyed most of the Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.’s Schoellkopf hydropower plant, resulting in a power shortage that endangered thousands of local manufacturing jobs. In response to the emergency, Congress passed the Niagara Redevelopment Act in 1957. After obtaining a license from the Federal Power Commission, Robert Moses commenced work on NYPA’s second hydroelectric generating station in early 1958. When it was completed, three years later, the Niagara Power Project was the largest facility of its kind in the Western world. In a recorded message broadcast February 10, 1961, to mark first power, President John F. Kennedy called the Niagara project “an outstanding engineering achievement” and an “example to the world of North American efficiency and determination.”\n\nBlenheim-Gilboa Pumped Storage Power Project <br>Legislation signed by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller in 1968 allowed NYPA to expand its generation assets and build nuclear and pumped storage power projects. This led to construction of the Blenheim-Gilboa Pumped Storage Power Project, which produced electricity for the first time in July 1973, and the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (named after a NYPA chairman), in Scriba, Oswego County, where power was first generated in February 1975.\n\n"}
{"id": "4380587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4380587", "title": "Nuclear explosion", "text": "Nuclear explosion\n\nA nuclear explosion is an explosion that occurs as a result of the rapid release of energy from a high-speed nuclear reaction. The driving reaction may be nuclear fission or nuclear fusion or a multi-stage cascading combination of the two, though to date all fusion-based weapons have used a fission device to initiate fusion, and a pure fusion weapon remains a hypothetical device.\n\nAtmospheric nuclear explosions are associated with mushroom clouds, although mushroom clouds can occur with large chemical explosions. It is possible to have an air-burst nuclear explosion without those clouds. Nuclear explosions produce radiation and radioactive debris.\n\nThe first man made nuclear explosion occurred on July 16, 1945 at 5:50 am on the Trinity Test Site near Alamogordo, New Mexico in the United States, an area now known as the White Sands Missile Range. The event involved the full-scale testing of an implosion-type fission atomic bomb. In a memorandum to the U.S. Secretary of War, General Leslie Groves describes the yield as equivalent to 15,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT. Following this test, a uranium-gun type nuclear bomb (Little Boy) was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, with a blast yield of 15 kilotons; and a plutonium implosion-type bomb (Fat Man) on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, with a blast yield of 21 kilotons. In the years following World War II, eight countries have conducted nuclear tests with 2475 devices fired in 2120 tests.\n\nIn 1963, the United States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The treaty permitted underground tests. Many other non-nuclear nations acceded to the Treaty following its entry into force; however, two nuclear weapons states have not acceded: France, China \n\nThe primary application to date has been military (i.e. nuclear weapons), and the remainder of explosions include the following:\n\n\nOnly two nuclear weapons have been deployed in combat—both by the United States against Japan in World War II. The first event occurred on the morning of 6 August 1945, when the United States Army Air Forces dropped a uranium gun-type device, code-named \"Little Boy\", on the city of Hiroshima, killing 70,000 people, including 20,000 Japanese combatants and 20,000 Korean slave laborers. The second event occurred three days later when the United States Army Air Forces dropped a plutonium implosion-type device, code-named \"Fat Man\", on the city of Nagasaki. It killed 39,000 people, including 27,778 Japanese munitions employees, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants. In total, around 119,000 people were killed in these bombings. (See \"Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\" for a full discussion). Nuclear weapons are largely seen as a 'deterrent' by most governments; the sheer scale of the destruction caused by a nuclear weapon has prevented serious consideration of their use in warfare, rendering the concept of total war completely useless.\n\nSince the Trinity test and excluding the combat use of nuclear weapons, mankind (those few nations with capability) has detonated roughly 1,700 nuclear explosions, all but 6 as tests. Of these, six were peaceful nuclear explosions. Nuclear tests are experiments carried out to determine the effectiveness, yield and explosive capability of nuclear weapons. Throughout the 20th century, most nations that have developed nuclear weapons had a staged test of them. Testing nuclear weapons can yield information about how the weapons work, as well as how the weapons behave under various conditions and how structures behave when subjected to a nuclear explosion. Additionally, nuclear testing has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength, and many tests have been overtly political in their intention; most nuclear weapons states publicly declared their nuclear status by means of a nuclear test.\n\nThe dominant effects of a nuclear weapon (the blast and thermal radiation) are the same physical damage mechanisms as conventional explosives, but the energy produced by a nuclear explosive is millions of times more per gram and the temperatures reached are in the tens of megakelvin. Nuclear weapons are quite different from conventional weapons because of the huge amount of explosive energy they can put out and the different kinds of effects they make, like high temperatures and nuclear radiation.\n\nThe devastating impact of the explosion does not stop after the initial blast, as with conventional explosives. A cloud of nuclear radiation travels from the epicenter of the explosion, causing an impact to life forms even after the heat waves have ceased.\n\nAny nuclear explosion (or nuclear war) would have wide-ranging, long-term, catastrophic effects. Radioactive contamination would cause genetic mutations and cancer across many generations.\n\n\n"}

He was elected a fellow of the Econometric Society in 1994, a fellow of the British Academy in 1999, and a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005.\n\nHis 1985 papers (with Jeremy Bulow and John Geanakoplos) developed the concept – and invented the terminology – of \"strategic complements\" that is now commonly used in game theory, industrial organisation and elsewhere.\n\nHis PhD thesis, and independent work by Carl Christian von Weizsacker, began the study of consumer switching costs.\n\nHis paper on supply function equilibria (with Margaret Meyer) developed a standard model for the analysis of privatised electricity markets, and has been important in developing the theory of multiunit auctions.\n\nHis papers (many of which are co-authored with Jeremy Bulow) apply ideas from auction theory to other economic contexts, including finance and political economy.\n\nHe has also invented new auction designs, including the \"Product Mix Auction\" that is now in regular use by the Bank of England (currently used monthly). This new auction for differentiated products has similarities to a simultaneous multiple-round auction, but runs instantaneously, is said to be more robust against collusion, and allows sellers, as well as buyers, to specify how the quantities they trade will depend on the auction prices. His other innovations include the Anglo-Dutch auction, and (with Aytek Erdil) Reference-Rule Pricing for package auctions.\n\nHe has also worked (with Elizabeth Baldwin) on applying tropical geometry to economics and auctions, including the Product Mix auction.\n\nHe was principal auction-theorist designing the UK '3G' mobile-phone license auction that raised £22½ billion in spring 2000 and was far more successful than several parallel exercises on the European continent. The Netherland auction that took place 3 months later raised 1/4 of the revenue per head of population, and the difference has been attributed to the auction design. It has been argued that the UK Treasury owes £15 billion or more to him and Ken Binmore, who led the auction team.\n\nIn 2002, he advised the UK government on the world's first auction for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, working with Nobel prizewinner Eric Maskin.\n\nIn 2007–2008, he advised the UK and US governments on the financial crisis, and he developed a new form of auction (the Product Mix auction) to help the Bank of England alleviate the liquidity crisis. The Bank Governor, Sir Mervyn King, told the Economist that \"The Bank of England's use of Klemperer auctions in our liquidity insurance operations is a marvellous application of theoretical economics to a practical problem of vital importance to financial markets.\" He subsequently advised other countries' Central Banks.\n\nHe advised the US Federal Trade Commission 1999–2001, was a member of the UK Competition Commission from 2001–5, and remains on its Panel of Economic Advisors.\n\nHe participated in the meeting that drafted the Potsdam Memorandum to the 2007 UN Climate Change Conference in Bali; he is on the Environmental Economics Academic Panel to the UK's Department of the Environment (Defra).\n\n\n\n\n"}

If spun in the opposite direction, it becomes unstable, \"rattles\" to a stop and reverses its spin to the preferred direction.\n\nThis spin-reversal appears to violate the law of the conservation of angular momentum. Moreover, for most rattlebacks the motion will happen when the rattleback is spun in one direction, but not when spun in the other. Some exceptional rattlebacks will reverse when spun in either direction.\nThis makes the rattleback a physical curiosity that has excited human imagination since prehistorical times.\n\nA rattleback may also be known as a \"anagyre\", \"celt\", \"Celtic stone\", \"rebellious celt\", \"rattlerock\", \"spin bar\", \"Robinson Reverser\", \"wobble stone\" (or \"wobblestone\") and by the product names \"ARK\", \"Bizzaro Swirl\", \"RATTLEBACK\", \"Space Pet\" and \"Space Toy\".\n\nArcheologists who investigated ancient Celtic and Egyptian sites in the 19th century found celts which exhibited the spin-reversal motion. The antiquarian word \"celt\" (the \"c\" is pronounced as \"s\") describes adze-, axe-, chisel- and hoe-shaped lithic tools and weapons.\n\nThe first modern descriptions of these celts were published in the 1890s when Gilbert Walker wrote his \"On a curious dynamical property of celts\" for the \"Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\" in Cambridge, England, and \"On a dynamical top\" for the \"Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics\" in Somerville, Massachusetts, US.\n\nAdditional examinations of rattlebacks were published in 1909 and 1918, and by the 1950s and 1970s, several more examinations were made. But, the popular fascination with the objects has increased notably since the 1980s when no fewer than 28 examinations were published.\n\nWhile rattleback artifacts are described as stone with various measurements, most which are sold currently as novelty puzzles and toys are described as plastic with measurements of 3.75 inches long x 0.75 inches wide x 0.4375 inches high. Carved wooden rattlebacks are described with a measurement of 5.5 to 6 inches in length. One plastic rattleback made and sold by Charles W. Sherburne is described as 12 inches in length. Glass rattlebacks, and those made of spoons, are described as being tested with unreported measurements. Larger rattlebacks (up to 8 feet long and 16 inches wide) are made on request by Emmanuel Peluchon for science museums.\n\nTwo rattleback design types exist. They have either an asymmetrical base with a skewed rolling axis, or a symmetrical base with offset weighting at the ends.\n\nThe spin-reversal motion follows from the growth of instabilities on the other rotation axes, that are rolling (on the main axis) and pitching (on the crosswise axis).\n\nWhen there is an asymmetry in the mass distribution with respect to the plane formed by the pitching and the vertical axes, a coupling of these two instabilities arises; one can imagine how the asymmetry in mass will deviate the rattleback when pitching, which will create some rolling.\n\nThe amplified mode will differ depending on the spin direction, which explains the rattleback's asymmetrical behavior. Depending on whether it is rather a pitching or rolling instability that dominates, the growth rate will be very high or quite low.\n\nThis explains why, due to friction, most rattlebacks appear to exhibit spin-reversal motion only when spun in the pitching-unstable direction, also known as the strong reversal direction. When the rattleback is spun in the \"stable direction\", also known as the weak reversal direction, friction and damping often slow the rattleback to a stop before the rolling instability has time to fully build. Some rattlebacks, however, exhibit \"unstable behavior\" when spun in either direction, and incur several successive spin reversals per spin. \n\nOther ways to add motion to a rattleback include tapping by pressing down momentarily on either of its ends, and rocking by pressing down repeatedly on either of its ends.\n\nFor a comprehensive analysis of rattleback's motion, see V.Ph. Zhuravlev and D.M. Klimov (2008). The previous papers were based on simplified assumptions and limited to studying local instability of its steady-state oscillation.\n\nRealistic mathematical modelling of a rattleback is presented by G.

Population: \n\nFounded in 1949, it was known as Pyaty Pochtovy (, lit. \"the Fifth Postal\") until 1954 and as Tomsk-7 () until 1992. City status was granted to it in 1956.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with five rural localities, incorporated as Seversk City Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Seversk City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Seversk Urban Okrug.\n\nSeversk is the site of the Siberian Chemical Combine, founded in 1954. It comprises several nuclear reactors and chemical plants for separation, enrichment, and reprocessing of uranium and plutonium. Following an agreement in March 2003 between Russia and the United States to shut down Russia's three remaining plutonium-producing reactors, two of the three plutonium producing reactors (the two that are sited at Seversk) have now been shut down.\n\nNuclear warheads are produced and stored on the premises. One of the most serious nuclear accidents at SGCE occurred on April 6, 1993, when a tank containing a highly radioactive solution exploded.\n\nThe current Chair of the City Duma and Mayor is Grigory Shamin, who has served since 2010. The current city manager is Anatoly Abramov, who has served since August 2007.\n\nSeversk was a secret city in the Soviet Union until President Boris Yeltsin decreed in 1992 that such cities could use their historical names. The town appeared on no official maps until then. As was the tradition with Soviet towns containing secret facilities, the designation \"Tomsk-7\" (like its predecessor \"Pyaty Pochtovy\") is simply a postal code which implies that the place is located close to the city of Tomsk.\n\nFor many years, residents had restrictions to enter or leave the city. Upon leaving Seversk, residents had to surrender their special entry passes at the checkpoint and were forbidden from discussing where they worked or lived. In 1987 some restrictions were lifted due to the large number of residents who worked or studied in Tomsk.\n\nThe city still remains closed to non-residents. There are six checkpoints where visitors must show entry documents. Permission to visit the city may only be granted by the appropriate authorities through the institution being visited, or through a private party such as a close relative. Prior to May 2007, visitors had to apply for entry passes at a special office in Tomsk proper. Since that date visitors can apply for entry documents directly at the main checkpoint.\n\nThere was a nuclear accident at the Tomsk-7 Reprocessing Complex on April 6, 1993, when a tank exploded while being cleaned with nitric acid. The explosion released a cloud of radioactive gas. \"TIME\" magazine has identified the Tomsk-7 explosion as one of the world's 10 \"worst nuclear disasters\".\n\nNine municipal cultural and artistic institutions successfully work in Seversk, as well as four establishments of additional education for children of artistic and aesthetic focus and two organizations of other forms — a nonprofit organization \"House of Culture in the name of N. Ostrovskiy\" and a cinema called \"Mir\".\n\nThere is a major post-secondary school in the city, the Seversk State Technological Academy, a branch of Tomsk Polytechnic University.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a white crystalline powder that is readily soluble in water. It is hygroscopic. It decomposes above 300 °C to release oxygen and leave sodium chloride. Several hundred million tons are produced annually, mainly for applications in bleaching paper.\n\nIndustrially, sodium chlorate is produced by the electrolysis of a hot sodium chloride solution:\n\nThis reaction progresses in heat (at least 70 degrees Celsius), and controlled pH. In lower temperature or with high pH another reaction progresses:\n2 NaCl + HO → NaClO + NaCl + H\n\nThe Chloralkali process is an industrial process for the electrolytic production of sodium hydroxide and chlorine.\n\nIt can also be synthesized by passing chlorine gas through a solution of sodium hydroxide. It is then purified by crystallization.\n\nThe main commercial use for sodium chlorate is for making chlorine dioxide (ClO). The largest application of ClO, which accounts for about 95% of the use of chlorate, is in bleaching of pulp. All perchlorate compounds are produced industrially by the oxidation of solutions of sodium chlorate by electrolysis.\n\nSodium chlorate is used as a non-selective herbicide. It is considered phytotoxic to all green plant parts. It can also kill through root absorption.\n\nSodium chlorate may be used to control a variety of plants including morning glory, canada thistle, johnson grass, bamboo, Ragwort, and St John's wort. The herbicide is mainly used on non-crop land for spot treatment and for total vegetation control on areas including roadsides, fenceways, and ditches. Sodium chlorate is also used as a defoliant and desiccant for:\n\nIf used in combination with atrazine, it increases the persistence of the effect. If used in combination with 2,4-D, performance is improved. Sodium chlorate has a soil sterilant effect. Mixing with other herbicides in aqueous solution is possible to some extent, so long as they are not susceptible to oxidation.\n\nThe sale of sodium chlorate as a weedkiller was banned in the European Union in 2009, with existing stocks to be used within the following year.\n\nChemical oxygen generators, such as those in commercial aircraft, provide emergency oxygen to passengers to protect them from drops in cabin pressure. Oxygen is generated by high-temperature decomposition of sodium chlorate:\n\nHeat required for this reaction is generated by oxidation of a small amount of iron powder mixed with the sodium chlorate, and the reaction consumes less oxygen than is produced. Barium peroxide (BaO) is used to absorb the chlorine that is a minor product in the decomposition.\nAn ignitor charge is activated by pulling on the emergency mask. Similarly, the Solidox welding system used pellets of sodium chlorate mixed with combustible fibers to generate oxygen.\n\nDue to its oxidative nature, sodium chlorate can be very toxic if ingested. The oxidative effect on hemoglobin leads to methaemoglobin formation, which is followed by denaturation of the globin protein and a cross-linking of erythrocyte membrane proteins with resultant damage to the membrane enzymes. This leads to increased permeability of the membrane, and severe hemolysis. The denaturation of hemoglobin overwhelms the capacity of the G6PD metabolic pathway. In addition, this enzyme is directly denatured by chlorate reducing its activity.\n\nTherapy with ascorbic acid and methylene blue are frequently used in the treatment of methemoglobinemia. However, since methylene blue requires the presence of NADPH that requires normal functioning of G6PD system, it is less effective than in other conditions characterized by hemoglobin oxidation.\n\nAcute severe hemolysis results, with multi-organ failure, including DIC and renal failure. In addition there is a direct toxicity to the proximal renal tubule. The treatment will consist of exchange transfusion, peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.\n\nSodium chlorate comes in dust, spray and granule formulations. There is a risk of fire and explosion in dry mixtures with other substances, especially organic materials, and other herbicides, sulfur, phosphorus, powdered metals, and strong acids. In particular, when mixed with sugar, it has explosive properties. If accidentally mixed with one of these substances it should not be stored in dwellings.\n\nMarketed formulations contain a fire retardant, but this has little effect if deliberately ignited. Most commercially available chlorate weedkillers contain approximately 53% sodium chlorate with the balance being a fire depressant such as sodium metaborate or ammonium phosphates.\n\nSodium chlorate is the active ingredient in a variety of commercial herbicides. Some trade names for products containing sodium chlorate include Atlacide, Defol, De-Fol-Ate, Drop-Leaf, Fall, Harvest-Aid, Kusatol, Leafex, and Tumbleaf. The compound may be used in combination with other herbicides such as atrazine, 2,4-D, bromacil, diuron, and sodium metaborate.\n\nSodium chlorate was an extensively used weedkiller within the EU, up until 2009 when it was withdrawn after a decision made under terms of EU Regulations. Its use as a herbicide outside the EU remains unaffected, as does its use in other non-herbicidal applications, such as in the production of chlorine dioxide biocides and for pulp and paper bleaching.\n\nHistorian James Watson of Massey University in New Zealand wrote a widely reported article, \"The Significance of Mr. Richard Buckley's Exploding Trousers\" about accidents with sodium chlorate when used as a herbicide to control ragwort in the 1930s. This later won him an Ig Nobel Prize in 2005, and was the basis for the May 2006 \"Exploding Pants\" episode of MythBusters.\n\n\n\n"}

Minimization of the occurrence and duration of manufacturing spillage requires that closed-loop control and associated process monitoring and metrology functions be integrated into critical steps of the overall manufacturing process.

In this context, \"syntactic\" means \"put together.\" The presence of hollow particles results in lower density, higher specific strength (strength divided by density), lower coefficient of thermal expansion, and, in some cases, radar or sonar transparency. A manufacturing method for low density syntactic foams is based on the principle of buoyancy.\n\nThe term was originally coined by the Bakelite Company, in 1955, for their lightweight composites made of hollow phenolic microspheres bonded to a matrix of phenolic, epoxy, or polyester.\n\nTailorability is one of the biggest advantages of these materials. The matrix material can be selected from almost any metal, polymer, or ceramic. Microballoons are available in a variety of sizes and materials, including glass microspheres, cenospheres, carbon, and polymers. The most widely used and studied foams are glass microspheres (in epoxy or polymers), and cenospheres or ceramics (in aluminium). One can change the volume fraction of microballoons or use microballoons of different effective density, the latter depending on the average ratio between the inner and outer radii of the microballoons.\n\nThe compressive properties of syntactic foams, in most cases, strongly depend on the properties of microballoons. In general, the compressive strength of the material is proportional to its density.\n\nThe matrix material has more influence on the tensile properties. Tensile strength may be highly improved by a chemical surface treatment of the particles, such as silanization, which allows the formation of strong bonds between glass particles and epoxy matrix. Addition of fibrous materials can also increase the tensile strength.\n\nThese materials were developed in early 1960s as improved buoyancy materials for marine applications. Other characteristics led these materials to aerospace and ground transportation vehicle applications. Current applications for syntactic foam include buoyancy modules for marine riser tensioners, remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), deep-sea exploration, boat hulls, and helicopter and airplane components. Structural applications of syntactic foams include use as the intermediate layer (that is, the core) of sandwich panels.\n\nOther applications include;\n\n"}

{"id": "3213691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3213691", "title": "There Will Be Blood", "text": "There Will Be Blood\n\nThere Will Be Blood is a 2007 American drama film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. It stars Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano. The film was inspired by Upton Sinclair's novel \"Oil!\" It tells the story of a silver miner-turned-oilman (Day-Lewis) on a ruthless quest for wealth during Southern California's oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Kevin J. O'Connor, Ciarán Hinds, and Dillon Freasier are also featured in the film.\n\n\"Fast Food Nation\" writer Eric Schlosser initially acquired the rights for the film from the Sinclair estate before Anderson took over the project. Anderson wrote the script with Day-Lewis in mind for the role of Plainview. Principal photography began in June 2006 on a ranch in Marfa, Texas, and took three months to complete. Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood composed the score for the film. The film was produced by Ghoulardi Film Company and distributed by Paramount Vantage and Miramax Films.\n\n\"There Will Be Blood\" grossed $76.2 million worldwide against its $25 million budget. The film received significant critical praise, with the performance of Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview receiving widespread acclaim. Other qualities of the film, such as its cinematography, direction, and screenplay, were also lauded and received numerous awards and nominations. It premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear Award for Best Director and a Special Artistic Contribution Award for Greenwood's score. It also appeared on many critics' \"top ten\" lists for the year, notably the American Film Institute, the National Society of Film Critics, the , and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Day-Lewis won Oscar, BAFTA, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, NYFCC and IFTA Best Actor awards for his performance, cementing his position as one of the most acclaimed actors of his generation. At the 80th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for eight Academy Awards (tying with another Paramount Vantage/Miramax co-production \"No Country for Old Men\"), including Best Picture and Best Director for Anderson; it won two for Best Actor for Day-Lewis and Best Cinematography for Robert Elswit.\n\nConsidered to be one of the best films ever made\", There Will Be Blood\" was among the highest-ranking 21st century films in the British Film Institute's 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls. It was also named the \"Best Film of the 21st Century So Far\" in 2017 by \"The New York Times\". and was ranked by BBC in 2016 as the third-best film of the 21st Century.\n\nIn 1898, Daniel Plainview, a prospector in New Mexico, mines a potentially precious ore vein from a pit mine hole. In the process of dynamiting the lode, he falls and breaks his leg. With the silver sample, he climbs out of the mine, drags himself to an assay office, and receives a silver and gold certificate claim. In 1902, he discovers oil near Los Angeles and establishes a drilling company. Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the man's orphaned son. He refers to the child, H. W., as his business partner, which allows him to present himself to potential investors as a family man.\n\nIn 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, who tells him of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Daniel attempts to buy the farm at a bargain price. However, Paul's twin brother, Eli, demands $10,000 for the church, of which he is pastor. An agreement is made for $5,000 after the well begins producing, and Daniel acquires all the available surrounding land, except for one holdout: William Bandy. Oil production begins, but an accident kills a worker and a gas blowout deafens H. W. Eli blames the disasters on the well not being properly blessed. When Eli demands the $5,000 that Daniel still owes, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table, Eli berates his father for trusting Daniel.\n\nA man arrives at Daniel's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry. Daniel hires Henry and the two grow close. H. W. sets fire to their house, intending to kill Henry. Angry, Daniel sends him away to a school for the deaf in San Francisco. A representative from Standard Oil offers to buy out Daniel's local interests, but Daniel strikes a deal with Union Oil and constructs a pipeline to the California coast, though the Bandy ranch remains an impediment.\n\nWhile reminiscing about his childhood, Daniel becomes suspicious about Henry's story and one night quizzes him about it at gunpoint. \"Henry\" confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry's, who died from tuberculosis, and that he learned the details of Henry's life by reading his personal journal. In a fit of rage, Daniel murders the impostor and buries his body. The next morning, Daniel is awakened by Bandy, who knows of the previous night's events and wants Daniel to repent. At the church, as part of Daniel's baptism, Eli humiliates him, strikes him, and makes him confess to having abandoned his son, before announcing to the congregation that Daniel will be making a large donation to the church. With the pipeline underway, Daniel arranges for the still angry H. W. to return, while Eli leaves town for missionary work.\n\nIn 1927, H. W. marries Mary, Eli and Paul's sister. Daniel, now extremely wealthy but suffering from alcoholism, lives as a recluse in a large mansion. Through a sign language interpreter, H. W. asks Daniel to dissolve their partnership so that H. W. can establish his own oil company in Mexico. Daniel reacts brutally, mocks H. W.'s deafness, and reveals H.W.'s true origins as an orphan. H. W. thanks God he has \"none of Daniel in him\" and leaves.\n\nEli visits Daniel, who is drunk, in Daniel's private bowling alley. Eli, now a radio preacher, offers to sell Daniel drilling rights on the land of William Bandy, who has recently died. Daniel agrees on the condition that Eli denounce his faith and his own credibility. Eli reluctantly does so. Daniel reveals that the property is now worthless because he has already drained its oil by slant drilling from surrounding wells. Shaken, Eli confesses to being in dire financial straits and to having strayed morally. Daniel taunts him, chases him around the bowling alley, and beats him to death with a bowling pin. When his butler enters the room, he finds Daniel sitting on the floor, muttering \"I'm finished!\"\n\nAfter Eric Schlosser finished writing \"Fast Food Nation\", reporters kept asking him about Upton Sinclair. Although he had read Sinclair's \"The Jungle\", he did not know about his other works or anything about Sinclair himself. He decided to read most of Sinclair's works, and eventually read the novel \"Oil!\", which he loved. Schlosser, who found the book to be exciting and thought it would make a great film, sought out the Sinclair estate and purchased the film rights. He thought that he would try to find a director who was as passionate about the book as he was, but director Paul Thomas Anderson approached him first.\n\nAnderson had been working on a screenplay about two fighting families. He struggled with the script and soon realized it was not working. Homesick, he purchased a copy of \"Oil!\" in London, drawn to its cover illustration of a California oilfield. As he read, Anderson became more fascinated with the novel. After contacting Schlosser, he adapted the first 150 pages to a screenplay. He began to get a real sense of where his script was going after making many trips to museums dedicated to early oilmen in Bakersfield. Anderson changed the title from \"Oil!\" to \"There Will Be Blood\" because he felt \"there's not enough of the book to feel like it's a proper adaptation\".\n\nHe said of writing the screenplay:\nAnderson, who had previously stated that he would like to work with Daniel Day-Lewis, wrote the screenplay with Day-Lewis in mind and approached the actor when the script was nearly complete. Anderson had heard that Daniel Day-Lewis liked his earlier film \"Punch-Drunk Love\", which gave him the confidence to hand Day-Lewis a copy of the incomplete script. According to Day-Lewis, being asked to do the film was enough to convince him. In an interview with \"The New York Observer\", he elaborated that what drew him to the project was \"the understanding that [Anderson] had already entered into that world, [he] wasn't observing it [he'd] entered into it and indeed [he'd] populated it with characters who [he] felt had lives of their own\".\n\nAnderson has stated that the famous line in the final scene, \"I drink your milkshake!\", was paraphrased from a quote by former Secretary of the Interior and U.S. Senator from New Mexico, Albert Fall, speaking before a Congressional investigation into the 1920s oil-related Teapot Dome scandal. Anderson said he was fascinated \"to see that word [milkshake] among all this official testimony and terminology\" to explain the complicated process of oil drainage. In 2013, an independent attempt to locate the statement in Fall's testimony proved unsuccessful—an article published in the Case Western Reserve Law Review suggested that the actual source of the paraphrased quote may instead have been remarks in 2003 by Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico during a debate over drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In those remarks, Domenici stated:\n\nAccording to Joanne Sellar, one of the film's producers, it was a hard film to finance because \"the studios didn't think it had the scope of a major picture\". It took two years to acquire financing for the film. For the role of Plainview's \"son\", Anderson looked at people in Los Angeles and New York City, but he realized that they needed someone from Texas who knew how to shoot shotguns and \"live in that world\". The filmmakers asked around at a school and the principal recommended Dillon Freasier. They did not have him read any scenes and instead talked to him, realizing that he was the perfect person for the role.\n\nTo build his character, Day-Lewis started with the voice. Anderson sent him recordings from the late 19th century to 1927 and a copy of the 1948 film \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", including documentaries on its director, John Huston, an important influence on Anderson's film. According to Anderson, he was inspired by the fact that \"Sierra Madre\" is \"about greed and ambition and paranoia and looking at the worst parts of yourself\". While writing the script, he would put the film on before he went to bed at night. To research for the role, Day-Lewis read letters from laborers and studied photographs from the time period. He also read up on oil tycoon Edward Doheny, upon whom Sinclair's book is loosely based.\n\nPrincipal photography began in June 2006 on a ranch in Marfa, Texas, and took three months. Other location shooting took place in Los Angeles. Anderson tried to shoot the script in sequence with most of the sets on the ranch. Two weeks in, Anderson replaced the actor playing Eli Sunday with Paul Dano, who had originally only been cast in the much smaller role of Paul Sunday, the brother who tipped off Plainview about the oil on the Sunday ranch. A profile of Day-Lewis in \"The New York Times Magazine\" suggested that the original actor, Kel O'Neill, had been intimidated by Day-Lewis's intensity and habit of staying in character on and off the set. Both Anderson and Day-Lewis deny this claim, and Day-Lewis stated, \"I absolutely don't believe that it was because he was intimidated by me. I happen to believe that—and I hope I'm right.\"\n\nAnderson first saw Dano in \"The Ballad of Jack and Rose\" and thought that he would be perfect to play Paul Sunday, a role he originally envisioned to be a 12- or 13-year-old boy. Dano only had four days to prepare for the much larger role of Eli Sunday, but he researched the time period that the film is set in as well as evangelical preachers. The previous two weeks of scenes with Sunday and Plainview had to be re-shot with Dano instead of O'Neill. The interior mansion scenes were filmed at the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, the former real-life home of Edward Doheny Jr., a gift from his father, Edward Doheny. Scenes filmed at Greystone involved the careful renovation of the basement's two-lane bowling alley. Anderson said it was \"a particular situation, because it was so narrow that there could only be a very limited number of people at any given time, maybe five or six behind the camera and then the two boys.\"\n\nAnderson dedicated the film to Robert Altman, who died while Anderson was editing it.\n\n\"There Will Be Blood\" was shot using Panavision XL 35 mm cameras outfitted primarily with Panavision C series and high-speed anamorphic lenses.\n\nDay-Lewis broke a rib in a fall during filming.\n\nAnderson had been a fan of Radiohead's music and was impressed with Jonny Greenwood's scoring of the film \"Bodysong\". While writing the script for \"There Will Be Blood\", Anderson heard Greenwood's orchestral piece \"Popcorn Superhet Receiver\", which prompted him to ask Greenwood to work with him. After initially agreeing to score the film, Greenwood had doubts and thought about backing out, but Anderson's reassurance and enthusiasm for the film convinced him to stick with it. Anderson gave Greenwood a copy of the film and three weeks later he came back with two hours of music recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Concerning his approach to composing the soundtrack, Greenwood said to \"Entertainment Weekly\":\n\nIn December 2008, Greenwood's score was nominated for a Grammy in the category of \"Best Score Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media\" for the 51st Grammy Awards. It features classical music. Brahms' \"Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 77, 3rd movement, \"Vivace ma non troppo\"\" can be heard in the ending titles and during the film Arvo Pärt's \"Fratres\" for cello and piano.\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives a score of 91% based on reviews from 216 critics, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The consensus reads, \"Widely touted as a masterpiece, this sparse and sprawling epic about the underhanded 'heroes' of capitalism boasts incredible performances by leads Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano, and is director Paul Thomas Anderson's best work to date.\"\nOn Metacritic, the film has an average score of 93/100, based on 42 reviews indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nAndrew Sarris called the film \"an impressive achievement in its confident expertness in rendering the simulated realities of a bygone time and place, largely with an inspired use of regional amateur actors and extras with all the right moves and sounds.\" In \"Premiere\", Glenn Kenny praised Day-Lewis's performance: \"Once his Plainview takes wing, the relentless focus of the performance makes the character unique.\"\nManohla Dargis wrote, in her review for \"The New York Times\", \"the film is above all a consummate work of art, one that transcends the historically fraught context of its making, and its pleasures are unapologetically aesthetic.\"\n\"Esquire\" also praised Day-Lewis' performance: \"what's most fun, albeit in a frightening way, is watching this greedmeister become more and more unhinged as he locks horns with Eli Sunday … both Anderson and Day-Lewis go for broke. But it's a pleasure to be reminded, if only once every four years, that subtlety can be overrated.\"\nRichard Schickel in \"Time\" praised \"There Will Be Blood\" as \"one of the most wholly original American movies ever made.\" Critic Tom Charity, writing about CNN's ten-best films list, calls the film the only \"flat-out masterpiece\" of 2007.\nSchickel also named the film one of the Top 10 Movies of 2007, ranking it at #9, calling Daniel Day-Lewis' performance \"astonishing\", and calling the film \"a mesmerizing meditation on the American spirit in all its maddening ambiguities: mean and noble, angry and secretive, hypocritical and more than a little insane in its aspirations.\" James Christopher, chief film critic for \"The Times\", published a list in April 2008 of his top 100 films, placing \"There Will Be Blood\" in second place, behind only \"Casablanca\".\n\nMick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", however, challenged the film's high praise by saying \"there should be no need to pretend \"There Will Be Blood\" is a masterpiece just because Anderson sincerely tried to make it one.\" Some critics were positive toward the work but less laudatory, often criticizing its ending. Roger Ebert assigned the film three and a half out of four stars and wrote, \"\"There Will Be Blood\" is the kind of film that is easily called great. I am not sure of its greatness. It was filmed in the same area of Texas used by \"No Country for Old Men\", and that is a great film, and a perfect one. But \"There Will Be Blood\" is not perfect, and in its imperfections (its unbending characters, its lack of women or any reflection of ordinary society, its ending, its relentlessness) we may see its reach exceeding its grasp.\" Carla Meyer of the \"Sacramento Bee\", who gave the film the same star rating as Ebert, opined that the final confrontation between Daniel and Eli marked when the work \"stops being a masterpiece and becomes a really good movie. What was grand becomes petty, then overwrought.\" In 2014, Peter Walker of \"The Guardian\" likewise argued that the scene \"might not be the very worst scene in the history of recent Oscar-garlanded cinema [...] but it’s perhaps the one most inflated with its own delusional self-importance.\"\n\nSeveral months after LaSalle's initial review of the film, he reiterated that while he still did not consider \"There Will Be Blood\" to be a masterpiece, he wondered if its \"style, an approach, an attitude... might become important in the future.\" Since 2008, the film has been included in the book \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\" and every revised edition released afterwards. \"Total Film\" placed it at number three in their list of the 50 best movies of Total Film's lifetime, while \"The Guardian\" ranked it the 17th best arthouse film of all time.\n\nMany have seen the film as a commentary on the nature of capitalism and greed, and its inherent national presence. Daniel Plainview's \"I have a competition in me\" speech has been looked at as key when analyzing the film from this angle. David Denby of the \"New Yorker\" described the film as being about \"...the driving force of capitalism as it both creates and destroys the future...\" and goes on to say that \"this movie is about the vanishing American frontier. The thrown-together buildings look scraggly and unkempt, the homesteaders are modest, stubborn, and reticent, but, in their undreamed-of future, Wal-Mart is on the way.\"\n\nOthers have noted themes of faith, religion, and family. Many feel that the contrast between Daniel and Eli highlights the disparity between faith and avarice. James Christopher of \"The Times\" viewed the film as \"...a biblical parable about America's failure to square religion and greed.\" Others have noted how the absence of family and resulting isolation in Daniel's life plays a large role in his eventual descent into madness. By the film's end, having felt betrayed by both Henry (his false brother) and H.W (his non-biological son), he reacts by murdering Eli. Critics and essayists also argue that these killings and rejections are Daniel's way of eliminating any possible source of competition in the oil industry.\n\nThe film was on the American Film Institute's 10 Movies of the Year; AFI's jury said:\n\"There Will Be Blood\" is bravura film-making by one of American film's modern masters. Paul Thomas Anderson's epic poem of savagery, optimism and obsession is a true meditation on America. The film drills down into the dark heart of capitalism, where domination, not gain, is the ultimate goal. In a career defined by transcendent performances, Daniel Day-Lewis creates a character so rich and so towering, that \"Daniel Plainview\" will haunt the history of film for generations to come.\nThe film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007.\n\n\nReview aggregator site Metacritic, when comparing over 40 'top ten of the decade' lists from various notable publications, found \"There Will Be Blood\" to be the most mentioned, appearing on 46% of critics' lists and being ranked the decade's best film on five of them.\n\nIn December 2009, Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" chose the film as the #1 film of the decade, saying:\nTwo years after first seeing \"There Will Be Blood\", I am convinced that Paul Thomas Anderson's profound portrait of an American primitive—take that, \"Citizen Kane\"—deserves pride of place among the decade's finest. Daniel Day-Lewis gave the best and ballsiest performance of the past 10 years. As Daniel Plainview, a prospector who loots the land of its natural resources in silver and oil to fill his pockets and gargantuan ego, he showed us a man draining his humanity for power. And Anderson, having extended Plainview's rage from Earth to heaven in the form of a corrupt preacher (Paul Dano), managed to \"drink the milkshake\" of other risk-taking directors. If I had to stake the future of film in the next decade on one filmmaker, I'd go with PTA. Even more than \"Boogie Nights\" and \"Magnolia\"—his rebel cries from the 1990s—\"Blood\" let Anderson put technology at the service of character. The score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood was a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be. And the images captured by Robert Elswit, a genius of camera and lighting, made visual poetry out of an oil well consumed by flame. For the final word on \"Blood\", I'll quote Plainview: \"It was one goddamn hell of a show.\"\n\n\"Chicago Tribune\" and \"At the Movies\" critic Michael Phillips named \"There Will Be Blood\" the decade's best film. Phillips stated:\nThis most eccentric and haunting of modern epics is driven by oilman Daniel Plainview, who, in the hands of actor Daniel Day-Lewis, becomes a Horatio Alger story gone horribly wrong. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the films hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel—plus, what I think is the performance of the new century—\"There Will Be Blood\" stands alone. The more I see it, the sadder, and stranger, and more visually astounding it grows—and the more it seems to say about the best and worst in the American ethos of rugged individualism. Awfully good!\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" critic Lisa Schwarzbaum named \"There Will Be Blood\" the decade's best film as well. In her original review, Schwarzbaum stated:\nAnyhow, a fierce story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American character with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men, really, including the false prophet Sunday) is only half Anderson's quest, and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to the telling itself. For a huge picture, There Will Be Blood is exquisitely intimate, almost a collection of sketches. For a long, slow movie, it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past, it's got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well down the road from Eli Sunday's church—and then, much later, announce a kind of end of the world. For bleakness, the movie can't be beat—nor for brilliance.\n\nIn December 2009, the website Gawker.com determined that \"There Will Be Blood\" is film critics' consensus best film of the decade when aggregating all Best of the Decade lists, stating: \"And when the votes were all in, by a nose, \"There Will Be Blood\" stood alone at the top of the decade, its straw in the whole damn cinema's milkshake.\"\n\nThe list of critics who lauded \"There Will Be Blood\" in their assessments of films from the past decade include:\n\n\nIn 2016, it was voted the #3 best film of the 21st century as picked by 177 film critics from around the world.\n\nThe first public screening of \"There Will Be Blood\" was on September 29, 2007, at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas. The film was released on December 26, 2007, in New York City and Los Angeles where it grossed US$190,739 on its opening weekend. The film then opened in 885 theaters in selected markets on January 25, 2008, grossing $4.8 million on its opening weekend. The film went on to make $40.2 million in North America and $35.9 million in the rest of the world, with a worldwide total of $76.1 million, well above its $25 million budget. But the prints and advertising cost for the film's United States release was about $40 million.\n\nThe film was released on DVD on April 8, 2008. It was released with one and two-disc editions, both are packaged in a cardboard case. Anderson has refused to record an audio commentary for the film. A HD DVD release was announced, but later canceled due to the discontinuation of the format. A Blu-ray edition was released on June 3, 2008. The film has grossed $23,604,823 through DVD sales.\n\nThe line, \"I drink your milkshake!\", used by Daniel Plainview to explain his technique has been used in other media repeatedly.

{"id": "1247989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1247989", "title": "Tunnel ionization", "text": "Tunnel ionization\n\nTunnel ionization is a process in which electrons in an atom (or a molecule) pass through the potential barrier and escape from the atom (or molecule). In an intense electric field, the potential barrier of an atom (molecule) is distorted drastically. Therefore, the length of the barrier that electrons have to pass decreases and electrons can escape from the atom's potential more easily. Tunneling Ionization is a quantum mechanical phenomenon, since in the classical picture an electron does not have sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier of the atom.\n\nWhen the atom is in a DC external field, the Coulomb potential barrier is lowered and the electron has an increased, non-zero probability of tunnelling through the potential barrier. In the case of an alternating electric field, the direction of the electric field reverses after the half period of the field. The ionized electron may come back to its parent ion. The electron may recombine with the nucleus (nuclei) and its kinetic energy is released as light (high harmonic generation). If the recombination does not occur, further ionization may proceed by collision between high-energy electrons and a parent atom (molecule). This process is known as non-sequential ionization.\n\nTunneling ionization from the ground state of a Hydrogen atom in an electrostatic (DC) field was solved schematically by Landau. This provides a simplified physical system that given it proper exponential dependence of the ionization rate on the applied external field. When formula_1, the ionization rate for this system is given by:\n\nLandau expressed this in units where formula_3. In SI units the previous parameters can be expressed as:\n\nThe ionization rate is the total probability current through the outer classical turning point. This is found using the WKB approximation to match the ground state hydrogen wavefunction though the suppressed coulomb potential barrier.\n\nThe ionization rate of a hydrogen atom in an alternating electric field, like that of a laser, can be treated, in the appropriate limit, as the DC ionization rate averaged over a single period of the electric field's oscillation. Multiphoton and tunnel ionization of an atom or a molecule describe the same process by which a bounded electron, through the absorption of more than one photon from the laser field, is ionized. The difference between them is a matter of definition under different conditions. They can henceforth be called MPI (multiphoton ionization) whenever the distinction is not necessary. The dynamics of the MPI can be described by finding the time evolution of the state of the atom which is described by the Schrödinger equation.\n\nWhen the intensity of the laser is strong, the \"lowest-order perturbation theory\" is not sufficient to describe the MPI process. In this case, the laser field on larger distances from the nucleus is more important than the Coulomb potential and the dynamic of the electron in the field should be properly taken into account. The first work in this category was published by Keldysh. He modeled the MPI process as a transition of the electron from the ground state of the atom to the Volkov states (the state of a free electron in the electromagnetic field). In this model, the perturbation of the ground state by the laser field is neglected and the details of atomic structure in determining the ionization probability are not taken into account. The major difficulty with Keldysh's model was its neglect of the effects of Coulomb interaction on the final state of the electron. As is observed from the figure, the Coulomb field is not very small in magnitude compared to the potential of the laser at larger distances from the nucleus. This is in contrast to the approximation made by neglecting the potential of the laser at regions near the nucleus. Perelomov et al. included the Coulomb interaction at larger internuclear distances. Their model (which is called the PPT model) was derived for short-range potential and includes the effect of the long-range Coulomb interaction through the first-order correction in the quasi-classical action. In the quasi-static limit, the PPT model approaches the ADK model.\n\nMany experiments have been carried out on the MPI of rare gas atoms using strong laser pulses, through measuring both the total ion yield and the kinetic energy of the electrons. Here, one only considers the experiments designed to measure the total ion yield. Among these experiments are those by Chin et al., Augst et al. and Auguste et al. Chin et al. used a 10.6 μm CO2 laser in their experiment. Due to the very small frequency of the laser, the tunneling is strictly quasi-static, a characteristic which is not easily attainable using pulses in the near infrared or visible region of frequencies. These findings weakened the suspicion on the applicability of models basically founded on the assumption of a structureless atom. Larochelle et al. have compared the theoretically predicted ion versus intensity curves of rare gas atoms interacting with a Ti:sapphire laser with experimental measurement. They have shown that the total ionization rate predicted by the PPT model fits very well the experimental ion yields for all rare gases in the intermediate regime of Keldysh parameter.\n\nThe dynamics of the MPI can be described by finding the time evolution of the state of the atom which is described by the Schrödinger equation. The form of this equation in the electric field gauge, assuming the single active electron (SAE) approximation and using dipole approximation, is the following\n\nwhere formula_7 is the electric field of the laser and formula_8 is the static Coulomb potential of the atomic core at the position of the active electron. By finding the exact solution of equation (1) for a potential formula_9 (formula_10 the magnitude of the ionization potential of the atom), the probability current formula_11 is calculated. Then, the total MPI rate from short range potential for linear polarization, formula_12, is found from\n\nwhere formula_14 is the frequency of the laser, which is assumed to be polarized in the direction of the formula_15 axis. The effect of the ionic potential, which behaves like formula_16 (formula_17 is the charge of atomic or ionic core) at a long distance from the nucleus, is calculated through first order correction on the semiclassical action. The result is that the effect of ionic potential is to increase the rate of MPI by a factor of\nWhere formula_19 and formula_20 is the peak electric field of laser. Thus, the total rate of MPI from a state with quantum numbers formula_21 and formula_22 in a laser field for linear polarization is calculated to be\nThe coefficient formula_26 is given by\nwhere\nThe ADK model is the limit of the PPT model when formula_31 approaches zero (quasi-static limit). In this case, which is known as quasi-static tunnelling (QST), the ionization rate is given by\nIn practice, the limit for the QST regime is formula_33. This is justified by the following consideration. Referring to the Figure, the ease or difficulty of tunneling can be expressed as the ratio between the equivalent classical time it takes for the electron to tunnel out the potential barrier while the potential is bent down. This ratio is indeed formula_31, since the potential is bent down during half a cycle of the field oscillation and the ratio can be expressed as \nwhere formula_36 is the tunneling time (classical time of flight of an electron through a potential barrier, and formula_37 is the period of laser field oscillation.\n\nContrary to the abundance of theoretical and experimental work on the MPI of rare gas atoms, the amount of research on the prediction of the rate of MPI of neutral molecules was scarce until recently. Walsh et al. have measured the MPI rate of some diatomic molecules interacting with a 10.6 μm CO2 laser. They found that these molecules are tunnel-ionized as if they were structureless atoms with an ionization potential equivalent to that of the molecular ground state. Talebpour et al. were able to quantitatively fit the ionization yield of diatomic molecules interacting with a Ti:sapphire laser pulse. The conclusion of the work was that the MPI rate of a diatomic molecule can be predicted from the PPT model by assuming that the electron tunnels through a barrier given by formula_38 instead of barrier formula_39 which is used in the calculation of the MPI rate of atoms. The importance of this finding is in its practicality; the only parameter needed for predicting the MPI rate of a diatomic molecule is a single parameter, formula_40. Using the semi-empirical model for the MPI rate of unsaturated hydrocarbons is feasible. This simplistic view ignores the ionization dependence on orientation of molecular axis with respect to polarization of the electric field of the laser, which is determined by the symmetries of the molecular orbitals. This dependence can be used to follow molecular dynamics using strong field multiphoton ionization.\n\nThe question of how long a tunneling particle spends inside the barrier region has remained unresolved since the early days of quantum mechanics. It is sometimes suggested that the tunneling time is instantaneous because both the Keldysh and the closely related Buttiker-Landauer times are imaginary (corresponding to the decay of the wavefunction under the barrier). In a recent publication the main competing theories of tunneling time are compared against experimental measurements using the attoclock in strong laser field ionization of helium atoms. Refined attoclock measurements reveal a real and not instantaneous tunneling delay time over a large intensity regime. It is found that the experimental results are compatible with the probability distribution of tunneling times constructed using a Feynman Path Integral (FPI) formulation.\n"}
{"id": "20876989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20876989", "title": "Wind-turbine aerodynamics", "text": "Wind-turbine aerodynamics\n\nThe primary application of wind turbines is to generate energy using the wind. Hence, the aerodynamics is a very important aspect of wind turbines. Like most machines, there are many different types of wind turbines, all of them based on different energy extraction concepts. \n\nThough the details of the aerodynamics depend very much on the topology, some fundamental concepts apply to all turbines. Every topology has a maximum power for a given flow, and some topologies are better than others. The method used to extract power has a strong influence on this. In general, all turbines may be grouped as being either lift-based, or drag-based; the former being more efficient. The difference between these groups is the aerodynamic force that is used to extract the energy.\n\nThe most common topology is the horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT). It is a lift-based wind turbine with very good performance. Accordingly, it is a popular choice for commercial applications and much research has been applied to this turbine. Despite being a popular lift-based alternative in the latter part of the 20th century, the Darrieus wind turbine is rarely used today. The Savonius wind turbine is the most common drag type turbine. Despite its low efficiency, it remains in use because of its robustness and simplicity to build and maintain.\n\nThe governing equation for power extraction is stated below:\n\nThe force \"F\" is generated by the wind's interaction with the blade. The magnitude and distribution of this force is the primary focus of wind-turbine aerodynamics. The most familiar type of aerodynamic force is drag. The direction of the drag force is parallel to the relative wind. Typically, the wind turbine parts are moving, altering the flow around the part. An example of relative wind is the wind one would feel cycling on a calm day.\n\nTo extract power, the turbine part must move in the direction of the net force. In the drag force case, the relative wind speed decreases subsequently, and so does the drag force. The relative wind aspect dramatically limits the maximum power that can be extracted by a drag-based wind turbine. Lift-based wind turbines typically have lifting surfaces moving perpendicular to the flow. Here, the relative wind does not decrease; rather, it increases with rotor speed. Thus, the maximum power limits of these machines are much higher than those of drag-based machines.\n\nWind turbines come in a variety of sizes. Once in operation, a wind turbine experiences a wide range of conditions. This variability complicates the comparison of different types of turbines. To deal with this, nondimensionalization is applied to various qualities. Nondimensionalization allows one to make comparisons between different turbines, without having to consider the effect of things like size and wind conditions from the comparison. One of the qualities of nondimensionalization is that though geometrically similar turbines will produce the same non-dimensional results, other factors (difference in scale, wind properties) cause them to produce very different dimensional properties. \n\nThe coefficient of power is the most important variable in wind-turbine aerodynamics. The Buckingham π theorem can be applied to show that the non-dimensional variable for power is given by the equation below. This equation is similar to efficiency, so values between 0 and less than 1 are typical. However, this is not exactly the same as efficiency and thus in practice, some turbines can exhibit greater than unity power coefficients. In these circumstances, one cannot conclude the first law of thermodynamics is violated because this is not an efficiency term by the strict definition of efficiency.\n\nThe thrust coefficient is another important dimensionless number in wind turbine aerodynamics.\n\nEquation () shows two important dependents. The first is the speed (U) that the machine is going at. The speed at the tip of the blade is usually used for this purpose, and is written as the product of the blade radius \"r\" and the rotational speed of the wind (\"formula_3\", where formula_4 is the rotational velocity in radians/second). This variable is nondimensionalized by the wind speed, to obtain the speed ratio:\n\nThe force vector is not straightforward, as stated earlier there are two types of aerodynamic forces, lift and drag. Accordingly, there are two non-dimensional parameters. However both variables are non-dimensionalized in a similar way. The formula for lift is given below, the formula for drag is given after:\n\nThe aerodynamic forces have a dependency on W, this speed is the relative speed and it is given by the equation below. Note that this is vector subtraction.\n\nAll wind turbines extract energy from the wind through aerodynamic forces. There are two important aerodynamic forces: drag and lift. Drag applies a force on the body in the direction of the relative flow, while lift applies a force perpendicular to the relative flow. Many machine topologies could be classified by the primary force used to extract the energy. For example, a Savonious wind turbine is a drag-based machine, while a Darrieus wind turbine and conventional horizontal axis wind turbines are lift-based machines. Drag-based machines are conceptually simple, yet suffer from poor efficiency. Efficiency in this analysis is based on the power extracted vs. the plan-form area. Considering that the wind is free, but the blade materials are not, a plan-form-based definition of efficiency is more appropriate.\n\nThe analysis is focused on comparing the maximum power extraction modes and nothing else. Accordingly, several idealizations are made to simplify the analysis, further considerations are required to apply this analysis to real turbines. For example, in this comparison the effects of axial momentum theory are ignored. Axial momentum theory demonstrates how the wind turbine imparts an influence on the wind which in-turn decelerates the flow and limits the maximum power. For more details see Betz's law. Since this effect is the same for both lift and drag-based machines it can be ignored for comparison purposes. The topology of the machine can introduce additional losses, for example trailing vorticity in horizontal axis machines degrade the performance at the tip. Typically these losses are minor and can be ignored in this analysis (for example tip loss effects can be reduced with using high aspect-ratio blades).\n\nEquation () will be the starting point in this derivation. Equation () is used to define the force, and equation () is used for the relative speed. These substitutions give the following formula for power.\n\nThe formulas () and () are applied to express () in nondimensional form:\n\nIt can be shown through calculus that equation () achieves a maximum at formula_8. By inspection one can see that equation () will achieve larger values for formula_9. In these circumstances, the scalar product in equation () makes the result negative. Thus, one can conclude that the maximum power is given by:\n\nExperimentally it has been determined that a large formula_6 is 1.2, thus the maximum formula_1 is approximately 0.1778.\n\nThe derivation for the maximum power of a lift-based machine is similar, with some modifications. First we must recognize that drag is always present, and thus cannot be ignored. It will be shown that neglecting drag leads to a final solution of infinite power. This result is clearly invalid, hence we will proceed with drag. As before, equations (), () and () will be used along with () to define the power below expression.\n\nSimilarly, this is non-dimensionalized with equations () and (). However, in this derivation the parameter formula_13 is also used:\n\nSolving the optimal speed ratio is complicated by the dependency on formula_14 and the fact that the optimal speed ratio is a solution to a cubic polynomial. Numerical methods can then be applied to determine this solution and the corresponding formula_1 solution for a range of formula_14 results. Some sample solutions are given in the table below.\n\nExperiments have shown that it is not unreasonable to achieve a drag ratio (formula_14) of about 0.01 at a lift coefficient of 0.6. This would give a formula_1 of about 889. This is substantially better than the best drag-based machine, and explains why lift-based machines are superior.\n\nIn the analysis given here, there is an inconsistency compared to typical wind turbine non-dimensionalization. As stated in the preceding section, the \"A\" (area) in the formula_1 non-dimensionalization is not always the same as the \"A\" in the force equations () and (). Typically for formula_1 the A is the area swept by the rotor blade in its motion. For formula_5 and formula_6 A is the area of the turbine wing section. For drag based machines, these two areas are almost identical so there is little difference. To make the lift based results comparable to the drag results, the area of the wing section was used to non-dimensionalize power. The results here could be interpreted as power per unit of material. Given that the material represents the cost (wind is free), this is a better variable for comparison.\n\nIf one were to apply conventional non-dimensionalization, more information on the motion of the blade would be required. However the discussion on Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines will show that the maximum formula_1 there is 16/27. Thus, even by conventional non-dimensional analysis lift based machines are superior to drag based machines.\n\nThere are several idealizations to the analysis. In any lift-based machine (aircraft included) with finite wings, there is a wake that affects the incoming flow and creates induced drag. This phenomenon exists in wind turbines and was neglected in this analysis. Including induced drag requires information specific to the topology, In these cases it is expected that both the optimal speed-ratio and the optimal formula_1 would be less. The analysis focused on the aerodynamic potential, but neglected structural aspects. In reality most optimal wind-turbine design becomes a compromise between optimal aerodynamic design and optimal structural design.\n\nThe aerodynamics of a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades is not the same as the airflow further away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition, the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields.\n\nEnergy in fluid is contained in four different forms: gravitational potential energy, thermodynamic pressure, kinetic energy from the velocity and finally thermal energy. Gravitational and thermal energy have a negligible effect on the energy extraction process. From a macroscopic point of view, the air flow about the wind turbine is at atmospheric pressure. If pressure is constant then only kinetic energy is extracted. However up close near the rotor itself the air velocity is constant as it passes through the rotor plane. This is because of conservation of mass. The air that passes through the rotor cannot slow down because it needs to stay out of the way of the air behind it. So at the rotor the energy is extracted by a pressure drop. The air directly behind the wind turbine is at sub-atmospheric pressure; the air in front is under greater than atmospheric pressure. It is this high pressure in front of the wind turbine that deflects some of the upstream air around the turbine.\n\nFrederick W. Lanchester was the first to study this phenomenon in application to ship propellers, five years later Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky and Albert Betz independently arrived at the same results. It is believed that each researcher was not aware of the others' work because of World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution. Thus formally, the proceeding limit should be referred to as the Lanchester–Betz–Joukowsky limit. In general Albert Betz is credited for this accomplishment because he published his work in a journal that had a wider circulation, while the other two published it in the publication associated with their respective institution, thus it is widely known as simply the Betz Limit.\n\nThis is derived by looking at the axial momentum of the air passing through the wind turbine. As stated above some of the air is deflected away from the turbine. This causes the air passing through the rotor plane to have a smaller velocity than the free stream velocity. The ratio of this reduction to that of the air velocity far away from the wind turbine is called the axial induction factor. It is defined as below:\n\nThe first step to deriving the Betz limit is applying conservation of angular momentum. As stated above the wind loses speed after the wind turbine compared to the speed far away from the turbine. This would violate the conservation of momentum if the wind turbine was not applying a thrust force on the flow. This thrust force manifests itself through the pressure drop across the rotor. The front operates at high pressure while the back operates at low pressure. The pressure difference from the front to back causes the thrust force. The momentum lost in the turbine is balanced by the thrust force.\n\nAnother equation is needed to relate the pressure difference to the velocity of the flow near the turbine. Here the Bernoulli equation is used between the field flow and the flow near the wind turbine. There is one limitation to the Bernoulli equation: the equation cannot be applied to fluid passing through the wind turbine. Instead conservation of mass is used to relate the incoming air to the outlet air. Betz used these equations and managed to solve the velocities of the flow in the far wake and near the wind turbine in terms of the far field flow and the axial induction factor. The velocities are given below as:\n\n\"U\" is introduced here as the wind velocity in the far wake. This is important because the power extracted from the turbine is defined by the following equation. However the Betz limit is given in terms of the coefficient of power formula_27. The coefficient of power is similar to efficiency but not the same. The formula for the coefficient of power is given beneath the formula for power:\n\nBetz was able to develop an expression for formula_27 in terms of the induction factors. This is done by the velocity relations being substituted into power and power is substituted into the coefficient of power definition. The relationship Betz developed is given below:\n\nThe Betz limit is defined by the maximum value that can be given by the above formula. This is found by taking the derivative with respect to the axial induction factor, setting it to zero and solving for the axial induction factor. Betz was able to show that the optimum axial induction factor is one third. The optimum axial induction factor was then used to find the maximum coefficient of power. This maximum coefficient is the Betz limit. Betz was able to show that the maximum coefficient of power of a wind turbine is 16/27. Airflow operating at higher thrust will cause the axial induction factor to rise above the optimum value. Higher thrust cause more air to be deflected away from the turbine. When the axial induction factor falls below the optimum value the wind turbine is not extracting all the energy it can. This reduces pressure around the turbine and allows more air to pass through the turbine, but not enough to account for the lack of energy being extracted.\n\nThe derivation of the Betz limit shows a simple analysis of wind turbine aerodynamics. In reality there is a lot more. A more rigorous analysis would include wake rotation, the effect of variable geometry. The effect of airfoils on the flow is a major component of wind turbine aerodynamics. Within airfoils alone, the wind turbine aerodynamicist has to consider the effect of surface roughness, dynamic stall tip losses, solidity, among other problems.\n\nThe wind turbine described by Betz does not actually exist. It is merely an idealized wind turbine described as an actuator disk. It's a disk in space where fluid energy is simply extracted from the air. In the Betz turbine the energy extraction manifests itself through thrust. The equivalent turbine described by Betz would be a horizontal propeller type operating with infinite blades at infinite tip speed ratios and no losses. The tip speed ratio is ratio of the speed of the tip relative to the free stream flow. This turbine is not too far from actual wind turbines. Actual turbines are rotating blades. They typically operate at high tip speed ratios. At high tip speed ratios three blades are sufficient to interact with all the air passing through the rotor plane. Actual turbines still produce considerable thrust forces. \nOne key difference between actual turbines and the actuator disk, is that the energy is extracted through torque. The wind imparts a torque on the wind turbine, thrust is a necessary by-product of torque. Newtonian physics dictates that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. If the wind imparts a torque on the blades then the blades must be imparting a torque on the wind. This torque would then cause the flow to rotate. Thus the flow in the wake has two components, axial and tangential. This tangential flow is referred to as wake rotation.\n\nTorque is necessary for energy extraction. However wake rotation is considered a loss. Accelerating the flow in the tangential direction increases the absolute velocity. This in turn increases the amount of kinetic energy in the near wake. This rotational energy is not dissipated in any form that would allow for a greater pressure drop (Energy extraction). Thus any rotational energy in the wake is energy that is lost and unavailable.\n\nThis loss is minimized by allowing the rotor to rotate very quickly. To the observer it may seem like the rotor is not moving fast; however, it is common for the tips to be moving through the air at 6 times the speed of the free stream. Newtonian mechanics defines power as torque multiplied by the rotational speed. The same amount of power can be extracted by allowing the rotor to rotate faster and produce less torque. Less torque means that there is less wake rotation. Less wake rotation means there is more energy available to extract. \n\nThe simplest model for horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) aerodynamics is blade element momentum (BEM) theory. The theory is based on the assumption that the flow at a given annulus does not affect the flow at adjacent annuli. This allows the rotor blade to be analyzed in sections, where the resulting forces are summed over all sections to get the overall forces of the rotor. The theory uses both axial and angular momentum balances to determine the flow and the resulting forces at the blade.\n\nThe momentum equations for the far field flow dictate that the thrust and torque will induce a secondary flow in the approaching wind. This in turn affects the flow geometry at the blade. The blade itself is the source of these thrust and torque forces. The force response of the blades is governed by the geometry of the flow, or better known as the angle of attack. Refer to the Airfoil article for more information on how airfoils create lift and drag forces at various angles of attack. This interplay between the far field momentum balances and the local blade forces requires one to solve the momentum equations and the airfoil equations simultaneously. Typically computers and numerical methods are employed to solve these models.\n\nThere is a lot of variation between different versions of BEM theory. First, one can consider the effect of wake rotation or not. Second, one can go further and consider the pressure drop induced in wake rotation. Third, the tangential induction factors can be solved with a momentum equation, an energy balance or orthogonal geometric constraint; the latter a result of Biot–Savart law in vortex methods. These all lead to different set of equations that need to be solved. The simplest and most widely used equations are those that consider wake rotation with the momentum equation but ignore the pressure drop from wake rotation. Those equations are given below. a is the axial component of the induced flow, a' is the tangential component of the induced flow. formula_31 is the solidity of the rotor, formula_32 is the local inflow angle. formula_33 and formula_34 are the coefficient of normal force and the coefficient of tangential force respectively. Both these coefficients are defined with the resulting lift and drag coefficients of the airfoil:\n\nBlade element momentum (BEM) theory alone fails to represent accurately the true physics of real wind turbines. Two major shortcomings are the effects of a discrete number of blades and far field effects when the turbine is heavily loaded. Secondary shortcomings originate from having to deal with transient effects like dynamic stall, rotational effects like the Coriolis force and centrifugal pumping, and geometric effects that arise from coned and yawed rotors. The current state of the art in BEM uses corrections to deal with these major shortcomings. These corrections are discussed below. There is as yet no accepted treatment for the secondary shortcomings. These areas remain a highly active area of research in wind turbine aerodynamics.\n\nThe effect of the discrete number of blades is dealt with by applying the Prandtl tip loss factor. The most common form of this factor is given below where B is the number of blades, R is the outer radius and r is the local radius. The definition of F is based on actuator disk models and not directly applicable to BEM. However the most common application multiplies induced velocity term by F in the momentum equations. As in the momentum equation there are many variations for applying F, some argue that the mass flow should be corrected in either the axial equation, or both axial and tangential equations. Others have suggested a second tip loss term to account for the reduced blade forces at the tip. Shown below are the above momentum equations with the most common application of \"F\":\n\nThe typical momentum theory applied in BEM is only effective for axial induction factors up to 0.4 (thrust coefficient of 0.96). Beyond this point the wake collapses and turbulent mixing occurs. This state is highly transient and largely unpredictable by theoretical means. Accordingly, several empirical relations have been developed. As the usual case there are several version, however a simple one that is commonly used is a linear curve fit given below, with formula_37. The turbulent wake function given excludes the tip loss function, however the tip loss is applied simply by multiplying the resulting axial induction by the tip loss function.\n\nThe terms formula_40 and formula_34 represent different quantities. The first one is the thrust coefficient of the rotor, which is the one which should be corrected for high rotor loading (i.e., for high values of formula_42), while the second one (formula_43) is the tangential aerodynamic coefficient of an individual blade element, which is given by the aerodynamic lift and drag coefficients. \n\nBEM is widely used due to its simplicity and overall accuracy, but its originating assumptions limit its use when the rotor disk is yawed, or when other non-axisymmetric effects (like the rotor wake) influence the flow. Limited success at improving predictive accuracy has been made using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers based on Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and other similar three-dimensional models such as free vortex methods. These are very computationally intensive simulations to perform for several reasons. First, the solver must accurately model the far-field flow conditions, which can extend several rotor diameters up- and down-stream and include atmospheric boundary layer turbulence, while at the same time resolving the small-scale boundary-layer flow conditions at the blades' surface (necessary to capture blade stall). In addition, many CFD solvers have difficulty meshing parts that move and deform, such as the rotor blades. Finally, there are many dynamic flow phenomena that are not easily modelled by RANS, such as dynamic stall and tower shadow. Due to the computational complexity, it is not currently practical to use these advanced methods for wind turbine design, though research continues in these and other areas related to helicopter and wind turbine aerodynamics.\n\nFree vortex models (FVM) and Lagrangian particle vortex methods (LPVM) are both active areas of research that seek to increase modelling accuracy by accounting for more of the three-dimensional and unsteady flow effects than either BEM or RANS. FVM is similar to lifting line theory in that it assumes that the wind turbine rotor is shedding either a continuous vortex filament from the blade tips (and often the root), or a continuous vortex sheet from the blades' trailing edges. LPVM can use a variety of methods to introduce vorticity into the wake. Biot–Savart summation is used to determine the induced flow field of these wake vorticies' circulations, allowing for better approximations of the local flow over the rotor blades. These methods have largely confirmed much of the applicability of BEM and shed insight into the structure of wind turbine wakes. FVM has limitations due to its origin in potential flow theory, such as not explicitly modelling model viscous behavior (without semi-empirical core models), though LPVM is a fully viscous method. LPVM is more computationally intensive than either FVM or RANS, and FVM still relies on blade element theory for the blade forces.\n\n\n"}

The first windmills able to rotate in order to \"face\" the wind appeared in the mid-18th century. Their rotatable nacelles were mounted on the main structure of the windmill using primitive wooden gliding bearings lubricated with animal fat. The necessary yawing torque was created by means of animal power, human power or even wind power (implementation of an auxiliary rotor known as fantail).\n\nVertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) do not need a yaw system since their vertical rotors can face the wind from any direction and only their self rotation gives the blades a clear direction of the air flow. Horizontal axis wind turbines however need to orient their rotors into and out of the wind and they achieve that by means of passive or active yaw \nsystems.\n\nHorizontal axis wind turbines employ some sort of yaw system which can be passive or active. Both passive and active systems have advantages and disadvantages and various design solutions (both active and passive) are being tried in order to find the optimal design for each wind turbine depending on its size, cost and purpose of operation.\n\nThe active yaw systems are equipped with some sort of torque producing device able to rotate the nacelle of the wind turbine against the stationary tower based on automatic signals from wind direction sensors or manual actuation (control system override). The active yaw systems are considered to be the state of the art for all the modern medium and large sized wind turbines, with a few exceptions proving the rule (e.g. Vergnet). The various components of the modern active yaw systems vary depending on the design characteristics but all the active yaw systems include a means of rotatable connection between nacelle and tower (yaw bearing), a means of active variation of the rotor orientation (i.e. yaw drive), a means of restricting the rotation of the nacelle (yaw brake) and a control system which processes the signals from wind direction sensors (e.g. wind vanes) and gives the proper \ncommands to the actuating mechanisms.\n\nThe most common types of active yaw systems are: \n\nThe passive yaw systems utilize the wind force in order to adjust the orientation of the wind turbine rotor into the wind. In their simplest form these system comprise a simple roller bearing connection between the tower and the nacelle and a tail fin mounted on the nacelle and designed in such a way that it turns the wind turbine rotor into the wind by exerting a \"corrective\" torque to the nacelle. Therefore, the power of the wind is responsible for the rotor rotation and the nacelle orientation. Alternatively in case of downwind turbines the tail fin is not necessary since the rotor itself is able to yaw the nacelle into the wind. In the event of skew winds the \"wind pressure\" on the swept area causes a yawing moment around the tower axis (z-axis) which orients the rotor.\n\nThe tail fin (or wind vane) is commonly used for small wind turbines since it offers a low cost and reliable solution. It is however unable to cope with the high moments required to yaw the nacelle of a large wind turbine. The self-orientation of the downwind turbine rotors however is a concept able to function even for larger wind turbines. The French wind turbine manufacturer Vergnet has several medium and large self-orienting downwind wind turbines in production.\n\nPassive yaw systems have to be designed in a way that the nacelle does not follow the sudden changes in wind direction with too fast a yaw movement, in order to avoid high gyroscopic loads. Additionally the passive yaw systems with low yaw-friction are subjected to strong dynamic loads due to the periodic low amplitude yawing caused by the variation of the inertia moment during the rotor rotation. This effect becomes more severe with the reduction of the number of blades.\n\nThe most common passive yaw systems are: \n\nOne of the main components of the yaw system is the yaw bearing. It can be of the roller or gliding type and it serves as a rotatable connection between the tower and the nacelle of the wind turbine. The yaw bearing should be able to handle very high loads, which apart from the weight of the nacelle and rotor (the weight of which is in the range of several tenths of tons) include also the bending moments caused by the rotor during the extraction of the kinetic energy of the wind.\n\nThe yaw drives exist only on the active yaw systems and are the means of active rotation of the wind turbine nacelle. Each yaw drive consists of powerful electric motor (usually AC) with its electric drive and a large gearbox, which increases the torque. The maximum static torque of the biggest yaw drives is in the range of 200.000Nm with gearbox reduction ratios in the range of 2000:1. Consequently, the yawing of the large modern turbines is relatively slow with a 360° turn lasting several minutes.\n\nIn order to stabilize the yaw bearing against rotation a means of braking is necessary. One of the simplest ways to realize that task is to apply a constant small counter-torque at the yaw drives in order to eliminate the backlash between gear-rim and yaw drive pinions and to prevent the nacelle from oscillating due to the rotor rotation. This operation however greatly reduces the reliability of the electric yaw drives, therefore the most common solution is the implementation of a hydraulically actuated disk brake.\n\nThe disk brake requires a flat circular brake disk and plurality of brake calipers with hydraulic pistons and brake pads . The hydraulic yaw brakes are able to fix the nacelle in position thus relieving the yaw drives from that task. The cost however of the yaw brake in combination with the requirement of a hydraulic installation (pump, valves, pistons) and its installation in the vicinity of brake pads sensitive to lubricant contamination is often an issue.\n\nA compromise that offers several advantages is the use of electric yaw brakes. These replace the hydraulic mechanism of the conventional brakes and with electro-mechanically actuated brake calipers. The use of electric yaw brakes eliminates the complexity of the hydraulic leakages and the subsequent problems that these cause to the yaw brake operation.\n\nSeveral wind turbine design and manufacturing companies experiment with alternative yaw breaking methods in order to eliminate the drawbacks of the existing systems and to reduce the cost of the system. One of these alternatives involves the use of air pressure in order to achieve the necessary yaw braking moment. In this case, some of the gliding surface (usually the axial, due to higher available surface) is utilized in order to accommodate the yaw brake pads and the pneumatic brake mechanism. The pneumatic actuator can be a conventional pneumatic cylinder or even a flexible air chamber which inflates when supplied with pressurized air. Such a device is able to exert very high braking forces due to the high active surface. This is achieved with a simple industrial air pressure compression system () which is a reliable and low cost solution. Furthermore, in the even of leakage, the environmental impact is practically zero compared to hydraulic oil leakages. Finally brake actuators can be produced with very low cost from lightweight plastic materials thus significantly reducing the overall cost of the system.\n\nThe yaw vane (or tail fin) is a component of the yaw system used only on small wind turbines with passive yaw mechanisms. It is nothing more than a flat surface mounted on the nacelle by means of a long beam. The combination of the large surface area of the fin and the increased length of the beam create a considerable torque which is able to rotate the nacelle despite the stabilizing gyroscopic effects of the rotor. The required surface area however for a tail fin to be able to yaw a large wind turbine is enormous thus rendering the use of such a device un-economical.\n\n"}
