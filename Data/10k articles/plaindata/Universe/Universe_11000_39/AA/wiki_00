It is housed in the purpose-built Santos Petroleum Engineering Building on the University's North Terrace campus. As of 2015 the Head of the school is Steve Begg. Prior to his appointment at the university in 2002, he worked for 19 years in the oil and gas industry; for 13 of those for BP.\n\nThe University of Adelaide established the National Centre for Petroleum Geology and Geophysics (NCPGG) on campus in 1986. The School of Petroleum Engineering and Management (SPEM) was also established in 2000. The latter development was facilitated by a commitment to the University of AU $25 million made by oil and gas company, Santos Limited in 1999. At the time it was believed to be 'the largest single industry sponsorship ever given to a public university in Australia.'\n\nOn 1 August 2001, Professor Peter Behrenbruch was appointed as the first Head of SPEM. He had been previously employed as Chief Reservoir Engineer with BHP Billiton, and a partnership between the school and his former employer soon followed.\n\nIn July 2003, the NCPGG and the SPEM merged to form the Australian School of Petroleum.\n\nBHP Billiton became the first corporate partner to follow Santos' original commitment of AU $25 million. The multi-national resource company committed $100,000 to funding research at the school, to be dispensed across 2002 and 2003. During a visit in 2001, Keith Hunter from BHP Billiton said of the relationship: \"We are looking forward to employing graduates from the School in four years time... We have also asked Professor Behrenbruch to develop some in-house courses for engineers already employed in BHP Billiton.\"The University's Vice-Chancellor Cliff Blake said of the school's relationship with corporate sponsors:\"The company (Santos Ltd) and the University intended the School to operate as a major resource for the benefit of the entire oil and gas industry.\"\n\nThe school offers scholarships and presents prizes annually to undergraduate and postgraduate students. Scholarships include:\nSixteen prizes are awarded annually, fourteen of which are sponsored by industry partners. Sponsors include: Beach Energy, Bear and Brook Consulting, BP, Chevron Australia, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Origin Energy, Santos, Shell and Woodside Energy.\n\n"}

During their ARS treatment, the crew were inadvertently infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusions. All recovered except for Aikichi Kuboyama, the boat's chief radioman, who died on September 23, 1954, from an underlying liver cirrhosis compounded by the secondary hepatitis C infection. Kuboyama is considered the first victim of the hydrogen bomb and of test shot Castle Bravo. \n\nBuilt in March 1947 and launched from Koza, Wakayama, the boat was originally named . It was a bonito boat and moored in Misaki Fishing Harbor, Kanagawa Prefecture. It was later remodeled into a tuna fishing boat. In 1953, it moved to Yaizu Port, Shizuoka Prefecture, with a new name, \"Daigo Fukuryū Maru\", translated as \"Lucky Dragon No. 5\" or the \"Fifth Lucky Dragon\".\n\nThe \"Lucky Dragon No. 5\" took five ocean voyages, the last of which began on January 22, 1954, and ended on March 14 of that year. The crew set off to go fishing in the Midway Sea near Midway Atoll, but when they lost most of their trawl nets to the sea, they altered their course southward near the Marshall Islands and encountered fallout from the Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll on March 1.\n\nA map of the varying location of the boat in the days leading up to and after the day of the explosion is available. On March 1, the map depicts the vessel very near to the border of the US Navy issued \"danger zone notice\" dated October 10, 1953. Following March 1, the vessel charted a practically straight geodesic course back to its home port of Yaizu, passing the same latitude as Wake Island between March 4 and 6 and arriving at Yaizu on March 14.\n\nThe source of the map, does not state how the map was created, that is, it does not state that the ship's log was consulted in the creation of the map, nor does it provide the navigator's measurements with the compass and sextant of the period. The exact position of the ship on the day of the explosion is therefore uncertain. Contemporary references give a figure of \"80 miles east of Bikini Atoll\" without stating the method by which the distance was computed. According to a 1997 paper by Martha Smith-Norris, the ship was operating \"14 miles\" outside the 57,000 square mile \"Danger Area\", and it was not detected by radar or visual spotter planes.\n\nThe \"Daigo Fukuryū Maru\" encountered the fallout from the U.S. Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll, near the Marshall Islands, on March 1, 1954. When the test was held, the \"Daigo Fukuryū Maru\" was catching fish outside the danger zone that the U.S. government had declared in advance. However, the test was more than twice as powerful as predicted, and changes in weather patterns blew nuclear fallout, in the form of a fine ash, outside the danger zone. On that day, the sky in the west lit up like a sunset. Seven minutes later, the sound of the explosion arrived, with fallout reaching the ship two hours later. The fishermen attempted to escape from the area, but they took time to retrieve fishing gear from the sea, exposing themselves to radioactive fallout for several hours.\n\nThe fallout – fine white flaky dust of calcinated Bikini Island coral, which absorbed highly radioactive fission products and neutron activated isotopes – fell on the ship for three hours. The fishermen scooped it into bags with their bare hands. One fisherman, Matashichi Oishi, reported that he \"took a lick\" of the dust that fell on his ship, describing it as gritty but with no taste. The dust stuck to surfaces, bodies and hair; after the radiation sickness symptoms appeared, the fishermen called it .\n\nFeeling ill, the crew set sail to return to Yaizu on March 2, and arrived on March 14.\n\nJapanese biophysicist Yasushi Nishiwaki immediately traveled from Osaka to Yaizu to examine the crew and their boat. He quickly concluded that they had been exposed to radioactive fallout and wrote a letter to the chief of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) asking for more information on how to treat the crew. The crew members, suffering from nausea, headaches, burns, pain in the eyes, bleeding from the gums, and other symptoms, were diagnosed with acute radiation syndrome and admitted to two Tokyo hospitals. On September 23, chief radio operator Aikichi Kuboyama, 40, died—the first Japanese victim of a hydrogen bomb. He left these words: \"I pray that I am the last victim of an atomic or hydrogen bomb.\" The US did not respond to Nishiwaki's letter or to letters from other Japanese scientists requesting information and help, although the United States did dispatch two medical scientists to Japan to study the effects of fallout on the ship's crew and to assist their doctors.\n\nThe US government refused to disclose the fallout's composition due to \"national security\", as the fallout's isotopic ratios—namely a percentage of uranium-237—could reveal the design of the Castle Bravo device through radio-chemical analysis, with this information having a history of being regarded as potentially revealing the means by which megaton yield nuclear devices achieve their yield. For instance, Joseph Rotblat may have deduced the staging nature of the device by studying the ratio and presence of tell-tale isotopes present in the fallout. As of 1954, the Soviet Union had not yet been successful with thermonuclear staging and such information could have assisted in their development of a thermonuclear weapon. Lewis Strauss, the head of the AEC, issued a series of denials; he also hypothesized that the lesions on the fishermen's bodies were not caused by radiation but by the chemical action of the caustic burnt lime that is produced when coral is calcined, that they were inside the danger zone. He told President Eisenhower's press secretary that the \"Lucky Dragon #5\" may have been a \"red spy outfit\", commanded by a Soviet agent intentionally exposing the ship's crew and catch to embarrass the USA and gain intelligence on the test's device.\n\nLater, the United States expanded the danger zone and it was revealed that in addition to the \"Daigo Fukuryū Maru\", many other fishing boats were in the expanded zone at the time. It is estimated that about one hundred fishing boats were contaminated to some degree by fallout from the test. Despite denials by Lewis Strauss concerning the extent of the claimed contamination of the fish caught by \"Daigo Fukuryu Maru\" and other ships, the FDA later imposed rigid restrictions on tuna imports.\n\nAt first, the US claimed that the extent of the \"Lucky Dragon\" incident contamination was trivial. Later, the United States paid Kuboyama's widow and children the equivalent in yen of about $2,800 ($ in 2018). The tragedy of the \"Daigo Fukuryū Maru\" gave rise to a fierce anti-nuclear movement in Japan, rising especially from the fear that the contaminated fish had entered the market. The Japanese and U.S. governments negotiated a compensation settlement, with the transfer to Japan of a compensation of $15,300,000, of which the fishery received a compensation of $2 million, with the surviving crew receiving about ¥ 2 million each, ($5,550 in 1954, $ in 2018). It was also agreed that the victims would not be given \"hibakusha\" status. The Japanese government pledged that it would not pursue further reparations from the U.S. government.\n\nThe majority of medical experts believe that the crew members were infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusions during part of their acute radiation syndrome treatment.\n\nThe longest staying crew member spent about a year in hospital following their return to port.\n\nLike the hibakusha, survivors of atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, the Lucky Dragon crew were stigmatized because of the Japanese public’s irrational fear of those exposed to radiation (it was commonly believed to be contagious). The crew tried to stay quiet about their exposure for a number of decades, beginning with their discharge from hospital. A number of the crew also had to move away from their previous places of residence to make a fresh start.\n\nFormer crew members include the 87-year-old, as of 2014, Susumu Misaki, who opened a tofu shop after the incident.\n\nTwenty years old at the time, Matashichi Oishi, who is reported to have licked the mysterious fallout substance which fell on his ship in March 1954, as a taste test to ascertain its properties, was 79 years old in August 2013. After the exposure, he left his hometown to open a dry cleaning business. Beginning in the 1980s, he frequently gave talks advocating nuclear disarmament. In 2011, he published a book titled, \"The Day the Sun Rose in the West: The Lucky Dragon and I.\"\n\nThe \"Daigo Fukuryū Maru\" was deemed safe for public viewing and was preserved in 1976. It is now on display in Tokyo at the Tokyo Metropolitan Daigo Fukuryū Maru Exhibition Hall.\n\nThe Toho Film \"Gojira\" (\"Godzilla\", 1954), was inspired in part by this event. The ship itself appears on a poster in 2001's \"Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack\", which also features Godzilla coming ashore and wreaking havoc in the Yaizu area.\n\nA poem, \"Japon Balıkçısı\" (The Japanese Fishermen), was written in 1956 by Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet Ran about the events.\n\nRalph Lapp wrote \"The Voyage of the Lucky Dragon\", which was published in 1958. It was reviewed on the front page of \"The New York Times Book Review\".\n\nA film version of the events, \"Daigo Fukuryū Maru\" (1959), was directed and screenwritten by Kaneto Shindo, and produced by Kindai Eiga Kyokai and \"Shin Seiki Eiga\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Pearce OBE (11 October 1941 – 8 September 2005) was Emeritus Professor at the Department of Economics at University College London (UCL). He specialised in, and was a pioneer of, environmental economics, having published over fifty books and over 300 academic articles on the subject, including his 'Blueprint for a Green Economy' series.\n\nDavid Pearce was born in Harrow, London on 11 October 1941, and attended Harrow Weald county grammar school, now part of Harrow College. He graduated in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics from Lincoln College, Oxford in 1963 (1st class) and then studied economics at London School of Economics from 1963 to 1964. He held academic posts at the Universities of Lancaster, Southampton, Leicester (from 1974-1979), and Aberdeen (Chair in political economy until 1983) before arriving at UCL as Professor of Political Economy and later in Economics in 1983, retiring in 2004.\n\nDuring his career he was the chief environmental adviser to the UK Secretaries of State between 1989 and 1992—Christopher Patten and Michael Heseltine. He also provided advice to a number of major companies. He was a convening lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nHe was co-director of the environmental economics research centre, CSERGE (Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment), from 1991 to 2001. Pearce also established the internationally renowned MSc in Environmental and Resource Economics at UCL. He was an inspirational teacher held in the highest esteem by the many graduates of this degree, most of whom are now working in environmental policy making and research throughout the world.\n\nPearce married Sue in 1966 and had two sons, Daniel and Corin. He lived latterly in Saffron Walden, Essex.\n\nPearce is best known for setting out economic valuation techniques for natural phenomena, arguing that the environment is \"under-priced\" and that environmental services may be calculated. If they are, their true worth is more likely to be recognised. His early work was on cost-benefit analysis and the economics of pollution and natural resource depletion, before these ideas entered the mainstream of the economic sciences and policymaking. \"Blueprint for Green Economy\" was published in 1989 (with Anil Markandya and Ed Barbier), and was a bestselling work with strong influence on governments in Britain and beyond. It advocated basing policy on the criterion of \"sustainability\", valuing environmental effects, and making use of market incentives. Market-based policies such as pollution taxes, tradable permits and conservation payments have some of their origins in Pearce's work—for example, Britain's landfill tax, the EU's emissions trading scheme and the various mechanisms for international pollution offsets in the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nFor Pearce, sustainability involved each generation passing on at least as much capital as it inherited. Environmental capital describes the stock and the state of natural resources. Economic damage was inevitable but could be controlled through realistic valuation in the market; the price of precious resources, or penalties for damaging them, should be set high (e.g. for noise, waste, global warming, risks to life and health, species conservation and biodiversity). Without this, future generations would suffer.\n\nHis love for nature and his care for the environment resonate through his work. At the same time, he was fiercely critical of environmental alarmism and sloppy environmental policy.. The \"valuation\" of natural phenomena was widely debated and challenged, sometimes by critics who saw Pearce as a supporter of market-based, neoliberal economic policy.\n\nPearce was commissioned by the Construction Research and Innovation Strategy Panel to write a report about the construction industry and after his death, a special issue of the journal Building Research & Information was dedicated to his memory in 2006.\n\n\nDavid Pearce died of leukaemia in September 2005, at the age of 63, only hours after being diagnosed.\n\n"}

It can also be referred to as axial drift velocity. In general, an electron will propagate randomly in a conductor at the Fermi velocity. An applied electric field will give this random motion a small net flow velocity in one direction.\n\nIn a semiconductor, the two main carrier scattering mechanisms are ionized impurity scattering and lattice scattering.\n\nBecause current is proportional to drift velocity, which in a resistive material is, in turn, proportional to the magnitude of an external electric field, Ohm's law can be explained in terms of drift velocity.\n\nThe most elementary expression of Ohm's law is:\n\nwhere is the drift velocity, is the electron mobility (with units m/(V⋅s)) of the material and is the electric field (with units V/m).\n\nThe formula for evaluating the drift velocity of charge carriers in a material of constant cross-sectional area is given by:\n\nwhere is the drift velocity of electrons, is the current density flowing through the material, is the charge-carrier number density, and is the charge on the charge-carrier.\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\nBut the current density and drift velocity, j and u, are in fact vectors, so this relationship is often written as:\n\nwhere \n\nis the charge density (SI unit: coulombs per cubic metre).\n\nIn terms of the basic properties of the right-cylindrical current-carrying metallic ohmic conductor, where the charge-carriers are electrons, this expression can be rewritten as :\n\nwhere\n\nElectricity is most commonly conducted in a copper wire.

The value of the EMC depends on the material and the relative humidity and temperature of the air with which it is in contact. The speed with which it is approached depends on the properties of the material, the surface-area-to-volume ratio of its shape, and the speed with which humidity is carried away or towards the material (e.g. diffusion in stagnant air or convection in moving air).\n\nThe moisture content of grains is an essential property in food storage. The moisture content that is safe for long-term storage is 12% for corn, sorghum, rice and wheat and 11% for soybean\nAt a constant relative humidity of air, the EMC will drop by about 0.5% for every increase of 10 °C air temperature.\n\nThe following table shows the equilibriums for a number of grains (data from ). These values are only approximations since the exact values depend on the specific variety of a grain.\n\nThe moisture content of wood below the fiber saturation point is a function of both relative humidity and temperature of surrounding air. The moisture content (\"M\") of wood is defined as:\n\nwhere \"m\" is the mass of the wood (with moisture) and formula_2 is the oven-dry mass of wood (i.e. no moisture). If the wood is placed in an environment at a particular temperature and relative humidity, its moisture content will generally begin to change in time, until it is finally in equilibrium with its surroundings, and the moisture content no longer changes in time. This moisture content is the EMC of the wood for that temperature and relative humidity.\n\nThe Hailwood-Horrobin equation for two hydrates is often used to approximate the relationship between EMC, temperature (\"T\"), and relative humidity (\"h\"):\n\nwhere \"M\" is the equilibrium moisture content (percent), \"T\" is the temperature (degrees Fahrenheit), h is the relative humidity (fractional) and:\n\nThis equation does not account for the slight variations with wood species, state of mechanical stress, and/or hysteresis.

It was introduced in 1948 and discontinued in 1982. An updated version was introduced in 2006 as part of the \"Vintage Modified\" line.\n\nThe Champ had the lowest power output and the simplest circuit for all of the Fender tube amps. The Champ had only one power tube, and the power stage circuit is, typically, single-ended and class A. Five watts and the simple toneful circuit allowed the Champ to be used easily and often in recording studios.\n\nFirst introduced in 1948, it sported the name \"Champion 800\" (with 8\" speaker), changing a year later to \"Champion 600\" (6\" speaker) with circuit designation 5B1. It was rated at about 3 watts, featuring a \"T.V. Front\" style cabinet; the 800 was covered in greenish fabric while the 600 featured two-tone blonde and brown vinyl covering. This style lasted until 1953, when Fender's cabinet style changed to the \"Wide Panel\" design with a tweed cloth covering. Fender also renamed the circuit the \"5C1\", \"5\" standing for the decade (1950s), \"C\" for the third circuit revision, and \"1\" was the Champ's circuit designation. The 5C1 circuit was extraordinarily simple, using one 6SJ7 pentode in the preamplifier section to provide a single stage of voltage amplification, one 6V6 beam power tetrode in the power amplifier section, a 5Y3 rectifier tube and a single volume knob with no tone controls.\n\nBy 1955 Fender started putting its amps in the \"Narrow Panel\" tweed cabinet with a plastic oxblood color grill cloth, and by this time the Champ was officially named the Champ (model 5E1). Through 1957, Champs only had a six-inch speaker, but the 1958 model 5F1 featured an 8\". The 5E1 and 5F1 circuits used a 12AX7 dual triode in the preamplifier to provide two stages of voltage amplification, and a single 6V6GT power tube to produce about 5 watts. A Champ from this era can easily be dated by the code stamped on the tube chart, by the code stamped on the speaker or by its serial number.\n\nThe 5F1 lasted until 1964, when the Champ finally made the transition to the \"Blackface\" style of circuit and cabinet. A small number of the last 5F1 style cabinets were covered with the \"Blackface\" amp cosmetics around this transition, as the factory most likely ran out of the tweed cloth covering. In 1964, a Champ with tremolo was also introduced. It was called the Vibro Champ. The Champ switched from Blackface to Silverface four years later. Fender brought back the blackface cosmetics for a short time in 1981 before discontinuing the Champ the following year.\n\nIn 2006, Fender \"reissued\" the Champion 600. Cosmetically similar to the original Champion 600, internally it features a modified blackface Champ circuit (with the settings of the tone stack being hard-wired rather than adjustable via Treble and Bass controls, and a couple of additional resistors reducing input-stage gain) and a switch to solid-state rectification from the original 5Y3 tube. The current look is the TV-front with two-tone tolex and speaker grille cloth of imitation suede. For a time after Fender's takeover of Gretsch, the same electronics were available with a different look and feel – based on \"tweed\" Fender amps, despite the branding – as the Gretsch G5222 Electromatic. Production of the Champion 600 reissue ceased in 2010 and was reintroduced by Fender in late 2014. As of 2016, the Champion 600 was once again discontinued.\n\n\nThe Fender Vibro Champ was a guitar amplifier made by Fender. It was first introduced in 1964 and discontinued in 1982. The Vibro Champ featured built-in tremolo with controls for speed and intensity. The silverface version served as a basis for the Bronco student amplifier of 1967.\n\nIn 2007, Fender reintroduced the Vibro Champ as the Vibro Champ XD, part of their \"Vintage Modified\" series. Aesthetically, the XD is based on the Champ from the blackface era. Unlike the Champion 600, which has a strictly all-tube audio signal path, the Vibro Champ XD's tube circuitry is complemented by a digital signal processor (DSP) that functions as a pre-amp by modelling 16 different amplifiers. The effect of the volume, gain and tone control knobs varies according to the selected amp model. The digitally modelled signal is fed into a class-A single-ended tube circuit, with a 12AX7 output tube driver, and a 6V6 output tube. The amp also comes equipped with DSP effects, including reverb, delay, chorus, tremolo, and Vibratone (there is no spring reverb tank).\n\n\nIn 1982, in order to combat its decreasing amp sales, which at that time was around 10,000 units per year, Fender hired Paul Rivera (of Rivera Amplifiers) and asked him to help design amplifiers with a modern sound. Even though he did not personally create the new designs his direction of the engineering team, headed by Mark Wentling, resulted in some legendary amps. The result included the Super Champ, featuring a 10\" speaker and new circuitry, including spring reverb, master volume, a switchable extra gain stage for a 'lead' effect, and a mid boost switch. In order to increase gain and cut costs, the Super Champ utilized 1× 12AX7 for the first and second stage preamp, a 1× 12AT7 for spring reverb driver tube, while a triple-triode 6C10 compactron is used for three functions; one as a third stage preamp for even more gain, one as the phase inverter (instead of two for most class-AB circuits), and one as recovery for the spring reverb. When the volume knob is pulled, some signal from the 12AT7 reverb driver is re-routed, resulting in higher gain. An optional two-button footswitch allowed for gain switching and reverb on/off. Two 6V6 power tubes provide it with 18 RMS watts. The cabinet was finished in black Tolex, with a black control panel and silver grille cloth. A more expensive version was available, factory-fitted with a Fender-branded EV Force 10 speaker instead of the usual Fender Blue Label. The Super Champ was sold until 1986.\n\n\nIntroduced along with the Super Champ described above, the Champ II was the most basic of the tube amps in the \"Rivera-era\" range of Fenders, having no reverb or extra gain switching. It was discontinued in 1983, along with the Bassman 20 (with which it shared the same metal chassis design), three years before the rest of the range, perhaps because its dearth of features was unfashionable at the time. It had the same colour scheme, power supply, output stage and stock speaker as the Super Champ but the preamp and phase inverter consisted of two 12AX7 tubes.\n\n\nIn 2007, Fender resurrected the Super Champ name with the Super Champ XD, part of their \"Vintage Modified\" series. The look is based on the blackface model. Although for a limited period of time a special edition Blonde version was produced, Fender’s Consumer Relations Department states that the blonde special edition Super Champ XD with oxblood grill was a FSR (factory special run) that was limited to only 1,000 produced. The blonde version is no longer available new and Fender has completed the amps' production run so no more will be produced or available from Fender. Unlike the Champion 600 (all tube circuitry), the Super Champ XD (like the Vibro Champ XD) is a hybrid (tube circuitry complemented with digital modeling and effects). Aside from one dual-triode 12AX7 and two 6V6 output tubes, it also has a digital signal processor (DSP) which models 16 different amplifiers and programs the volume, gain, and tone controls accordingly.\n\nIt has two channels, channel 1 being a clean channel, and channel 2 having both clean and distortion voices, using modeling technology to provide 15 additional voices. Both the Bass/Treble EQ and Effects (FX) are global settings meaning they affect the sound of both channel 1 and channel 2.\n\nThere are two stages of amplification: the first stage is done by solid-state op amps and the DSP, which also provide the desired voicing of the amps. It is then fed into the first triode of the 12AX7, which acts as a second stage preamp, provides the additional tube gain for both channels and acts as an interface between the solid-state circuitry and the tube circuitry. The second triode is a phase inverter, which creates mirror images of the signal to drive the output tubes. This arrangement provides the same feel of a complete tube amp while allowing multiple voicing. The DSP chip also provides effects, including reverb, delay, chorus, and tremolo. There is no spring reverb tank.\n\nIn 2012, Fender released the Super Champ X2, a redesign of the XD. The X2 is designed to interface with the FUSE software used by the Fender Mustang series of modeling solid-state amplifiers, and is also available in both combo and discrete head/speaker cabinet units.\n\n\nFender reissued the 1957 narrow panel tweed Champ in 2009.\n\n"}

An event similar to a GLOF, where a body of water contained by a glacier melts or overflows the glacier, is called a Jökulhlaup. The dam can consist of glacier ice or a terminal moraine. Failure can happen due to erosion, a buildup of water pressure, an avalanche of rock or heavy snow, an earthquake or cryoseism, volcanic eruptions under the ice, or if a large enough portion of a glacier breaks off and massively displaces the waters in a glacial lake at its base.\n\nA glacial lake outburst flood is a type of outburst flood occurring when water dammed by a glacier or a moraine is released. A water body that is dammed by the front of a glacier is called a marginal lake, and a water body that is capped by the glacier is called a sub-glacial lake. When a marginal lake bursts, it may also be called a marginal lake drainage. When a sub-glacial lake bursts, it may be called a jökulhlaup.\n\nA jökulhlaup is thus a sub-glacial outburst flood. Jökulhlaup is an Icelandic term that has been adopted into the English language, originally referring only to glacial outburst floods from Vatnajökull, which are triggered by volcanic eruptions, but now is accepted to describe any abrupt and large release of sub-glacial water.\n\nGlacial lake volumes vary, but may hold millions to hundreds of millions of cubic metres of water. Catastrophic failure of the containing ice or glacial sediment can release this water over periods of minutes to days. Peak flows as high as 15,000 cubic metres per second have been recorded in such events, suggesting that the v-shaped canyon of a normally small mountain stream could suddenly develop an extremely turbulent and fast-moving torrent some deep. Glacial Lake Outburst Floods are often compounded by a massive river bed erosion in the steep moraine valleys, as a result, the flood peaks increase as they flow downstream until the river reaches, where the sediment deposits. On a downstream floodplain, it suggests a somewhat slower inundation spreading as much as wide. Both scenarios are significant threats to life, property and infrastructure.\n\nThe United Nations has a series of monitoring efforts to help prevent death and destruction in regions that are likely to experience these events. The importance of this situation has magnified over the past century due to increased populations, and the increasing number of glacial lakes that have developed due to glacier retreat. While all countries with glaciers are susceptible to this problem, central Asia, the Andes regions of South America and those countries in Europe that have glaciers in the Alps, have been identified as the regions at greatest risk.\n\nThere are a number of imminent deadly GLOFs situations that have been identified worldwide. The Tsho Rolpa glacier lake is located in the Rolwaling Valley, about northeast of Kathmandu, Nepal, at an altitude of . The lake is dammed by a high unconsolidated terminal moraine dam. The lake is growing larger every year due to the melting and retreat of the Trakarding Glacier, and has become the largest and most dangerous glacier lake in Nepal, with approximately 90 to 100 million m (117 to 130 million yd) of water stored.\n\nThe most famous are the immense jökulhlaup released from the Vatnajökull Ice Cap in Iceland. It is not by chance that the term \"jökulhlaup\" (\"jökull\" = glacier, \"hlaup\" = run (\"n.\")/running) comes from Icelandic, as the south of Iceland has very often been the victim of such catastrophes. This was the case in 1996, when the volcano under the Grímsvötn lakes belonging to the Vatnajökull glacier erupted, and the river Skeiðará flooded the land in front of Skaftafell, now part of Vatnajökull National Park. The jökulhlaup reached a flow rate of 50,000 cubic metres per second, and destroyed parts of the Hringvegur (Ring Road or Iceland Road #1). The flood carried ice floes that weighed up to 5000 tons with icebergs between 100–200 tons striking the Gigjukvisl Bridge of the Ring Road (the ruins are well marked with explanatory signs today as a popular tourist stop). The tsunami released was up to high and wide. The flood carried with it 185 million tons of silt.\nThe jökulhlaup flow made it for several days the 2nd largest river (in terms of water flow) after the Amazon.\n\nAfter the flooding, some icebergs high could be seen on the banks of the river where the glacier run had left them behind (see also Mýrdalsjökull). The peak water release from a lake that develops around the Grímsvötn Volcanic Crater in the center of the Vatnajökull ice cap generates flows that exceed the volume of the Mississippi River. The outbursts have occurred in 1954, 1960, 1965, 1972, 1976, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1991 and 1996. In 1996, the eruption melted of ice and yielded an outburst of per second at peak flow.\n\nDuring the late Quaternary, ancient Lake Atna in the Copper River Basin may have generated a number of glacial outburst floods.\n\nSome jökulhlaups release annually. Lake George near the Knik River had large annual outbreaks from 1918 to 1966. Since 1966 the Knik Glacier has retreated and an ice-dam is no longer created. Lake George might resume annual floods if the glacier thickens again and blocks the valley (Post and Mayo, 1971).\n\nAlmost every year, GLOFs occur in two locations in southeastern Alaska, one of which is Abyss Lake. The releases associated with the Tulsequah Glacier near Juneau often inundate a nearby airstrip. About 40 cabins could potentially be affected and a few have been damaged by the larger floods. Events from Salmon Glacier near Hyder have damaged roads near the Salmon River.\n\nImmense prehistoric GLOFs, known as the Missoula Floods or Spokane Floods, occurred in North America's Columbia River watershed toward the end of the last ice age. They were the result of periodic breaches of ice dams in present-day Montana, resulting in the draining of a body of water now known as Glacial Lake Missoula. The immense floods scoured the Columbia Plateau as the water raced toward the ocean, resulting in the Channeled Scablands topography that exists today across Central and Eastern Washington.\n\nGlacial River Warren drained Glacial Lake Agassiz during the Wisconsinian glaciation; the now mild Minnesota River flows through its bed. This river seasonally drained glacial meltwater into what is now the Upper Mississippi River. The region now termed the Driftless Area of North America was contemporaneously also subject to glacial outburst floods from Glacial Lake Grantsburg, and Glacial Lake Duluth during all three phases of the last ice age.\n\nBetween 6 and 10 September 2003, a GLOF occurred from Grasshopper Glacier in the Wind River Mountains, Wyoming. A proglacial lake at the head of the glacier burst through a glacial dam, and water from the lake carved a trench down the center of the glacier for more than . An estimated of water were released in four days, raising the flow level of Dinwoody Creek from per second to per second, as recorded at a gauging station downstream. Debris from the flood was deposited more than along the creek. The GLOF has been attributed to the rapid retreat of the glacier, which has been ongoing since the glacier was first accurately measured in the 1960s.\n\nA flood caused by a glacial lake outburst flood on December 13, 1941 killed an estimated 1,800 people along its path in Peru, including many in the town of Huarez. The cause was a block of ice that fell from a glacier in the Cordillera Blanca mountains into Lake Palcacocha. This event has been described as a historic inspiration for research into glacial lake outburst floods. Numerous Peruvian geologists and engineers created techniques for avoiding such floods and exported the techniques worldwide.\n\nIn 1978, debris flows triggered by a jökulhlaup from Cathedral Glacier destroyed part of the Canadian Pacific railway track, derailed a freight train and buried parts of the Trans Canada Highway.\n\nIn 1994, a jökulhlaup occurred at Farrow Creek, British Columbia.\n\nIn 2003, a jökulhlaup drained into Lake Tuborg on Ellesmere Island, and the events and its aftermath were monitored. The ice-dammed lake drained catastrophically by floating its ice dam. This is an extremely rare occurrence in the Canadian High Arctic, where most glaciers are cold based, and ice-dammed lakes typically drain slowly by overtopping their dams.\n\nIt has been suggested that the Heinrich events during the last glaciation could have been caused by gigantic jökulhlaups from a Hudson Bay lake dammed by ice at the mouth of Hudson Strait.\n\nGLOFs occur with regularity in the valleys and low lying river plains of Bhutan.\nIn the recent past, flash floods have occurred in the Thimphu, Paro and Punankha-Wangdue valleys. Of the 2674 glacial lakes in Bhutan, 24 have been identified by a recent study as candidates for GLOFs in the near future. In October 1994, a GLOF upstream from Punakha Dzong caused massive flooding on the River, damaging the dzong and causing casualties.\n\nIn 2001, scientists identified Lake Thorthormi as one that threatened imminent and catastrophic collapse. The situation was eventually relieved by carving a water channel from the lip of the lake to relieve water pressure.\n\nThe Strait of Dover is thought to have been created around 200,000 years ago by a catastrophic GLOF caused by the breaching of the Weald-Artois Anticline, which acted as a natural dam that held back a large lake in the Doggerland region, now submerged under the North Sea. The flood would have lasted several months, releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second. The cause of the breach is not known but may have been caused by an earthquake or simply the build-up of water pressure in the lake. As well as destroying the isthmus that connected Britain to continental Europe, the flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley down the length of the English Channel, leaving behind streamlined islands and longitudinal erosional grooves characteristic of catastrophic megaflood events.\n\nEven though GLOF events have been occurring in Nepal for many decades, the Dig Cho glacial lake outburst, which took place in 1985, has triggered detailed study of this phenomenon. In 1996, the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS) of Nepal reported that five lakes were potentially dangerous, namely, Dig Tsho, Imja, Lower Barun, Tsho Rolpa, and Thulagi, all lying above 4100 m. A recent study done by ICIMOD and UNEP (UNEP, 2001) reported 20 potentially dangerous lakes in Nepal. In ten of them GLOF events have occurred in the past few years and some have been regenerating after the event. Additional dangerous glacial lakes may exist in parts of Tibet that are drained by streams crossing into Nepal, raising the possibility of outburst incidents in Tibet causing downstream damage in Nepal. The Gandaki River basin is reported to contain 1025 glaciers and 338 lakes.\n\nThulagi glacier\nThe Thulagi glacier, which is located in the Upper Marsyangdi River basin, is one out of the two moraine-dammed lakes (supra-glacial lakes), identified as a potentially dangerous lake. The KfW, Frankfurt, the BGR (Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources, Germany), in cooperation with the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology in Kathmandu, have carried out studies on the Thulagi Glacier and have concluded that even assuming the worst case, a disastrous outburst of the lake can be excluded in the near future.\n\nIn 1929, a GLOF from the Chong Khumdan Glacier in the Karakoram caused flooding on the Indus River 1,200 km downstream (a maximum flood rise of 8.1 m at Attock).\n\nLongbasaba and Pida lakes are two moraine-dammed lakes at an altitude of about 5700 m in the Eastern Himalayas. Due to the rise of temperature, the areas of the Longbasaba and Kaer glaciers decreased by 8.7% and 16.6% from 1978 to 2005. Water from glaciers directly flowed into Longbasaba and Pida lakes, and the area of the two lakes increased by 140% and 194%. According to the report of the Hydrological Department of Tibet in 2006, if a GLOF had occurred at the two lakes, 23 towns and villages, where more than 12,500 people live, would have been endangered.\n\nIn Tibet, one of the major barley producing areas of the Tibetan Plateau was destroyed by GLOFs in August 2000. More than 10,000 homes, 98 bridges and dykes were destroyed and its estimated cost was about $75 million. The farming communities faced food shortages that year by losing their grain and livestock.\n\nA major GLOF was reported in 1978 in the valley of the Shaksgam River in the Karakoram, a part of historic Kashmir, ceded by Pakistan to China.\n\nThe 1818 Giétro Glacier catastrophe, killing 44 people, originated in a 4-km long valley located in south-western Switzerland. Fatal flooding was known during historical times with 140 deaths first recorded in 1595. After an increase of the glacier during the \"Year Without a Summer\", an ice cone started to form from the accumulation of falling seracs. During 1816, the valley filled into a lake which emptied during the spring of 1817. In spring of 1818, the lake measured about 2 km in length. To stop the rapid rise of waters, the canton engineer Ignaz Venetz decided to drill a sluice hole through the ice, tunneling from both upstream and downstream sides of the ice dam at an elevation of about 20 metres above the lake surface. An avalanche interrupted work, so a secondary tunnel was then drilled for safety reasons as the waters rose to 10 metres below. Dangerous sloughing of ice delayed the work until finally a 198-metre-long hole was completed on 4 June, days before lake began to escape via the manmade waterfall on 13 June. Venetz warned the inhabitants of the valley of the danger as water was also escaping from the base of the cone. However, the cone began to crack on the morning of 16 June and at 16:30 the ice dam broke sending 18 million m of flood waters into the valley below.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12666", "title": "Gluon", "text": "Gluon\n\nA gluon () is an elementary particle that acts as the exchange particle (or gauge boson) for the strong force between quarks. It is analogous to the exchange of photons in the electromagnetic force between two charged particles. In layman's terms, they \"glue\" quarks together, forming hadrons such as protons and neutrons.\n\nIn technical terms, gluons are vector gauge bosons that mediate strong interactions of quarks in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Gluons themselves carry the color charge of the strong interaction. This is unlike the photon, which mediates the electromagnetic interaction but lacks an electric charge. Gluons therefore participate in the strong interaction in addition to mediating it, making QCD significantly harder to analyze than QED (quantum electrodynamics).\n\nThe gluon is a vector boson; like the photon, it has a spin of 1. While massive spin-1 particles have three polarization states, massless gauge bosons like the gluon have only two polarization states because gauge invariance requires the polarization to be transverse. In quantum field theory, unbroken gauge invariance requires that gauge bosons have zero mass (experiments limit the gluon's rest mass to less than a few meV/c). The gluon has negative intrinsic parity.\n\nUnlike the single photon of QED or the three W and Z bosons of the weak interaction, there are eight independent types of gluon in QCD.\n\nThis may be difficult to understand intuitively. Quarks carry three types of color charge; antiquarks carry three types of anticolor. Gluons may be thought of as carrying both color and anticolor. This gives nine \"possible\" combinations of color and anticolor in gluons. The following is a list of those combinations (and their schematic names):\n\nThese are not the \"actual\" color states of observed gluons, but rather \"effective\" states. To correctly understand how they are combined, it is necessary to consider the mathematics of color charge in more detail.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the states of particles may be added according to the principle of superposition; that is, they may be in a \"combined state\" with a \"probability\", if some particular quantity is measured, of giving several different outcomes. A relevant illustration in the case at hand would be a gluon with a color state described by:\n\nThis is read as \"red–antiblue plus blue–antired\". (The factor of the square root of two is required for normalization, a detail that is not crucial to understand in this discussion.) If one were somehow able to make a direct measurement of the color of a gluon in this state, there would be a 50% chance of it having red-antiblue color charge and a 50% chance of blue-antired color charge.\n\nIt is often said that the stable strongly interacting particles (such as the proton and the neutron, i.e. hadrons) observed in nature are \"colorless\", but more precisely they are in a \"color singlet\" state, which is mathematically analogous to a \"spin\" singlet state. Such states allow interaction with other color singlets, but not with other color states; because long-range gluon interactions do not exist, this illustrates that gluons in the singlet state do not exist either.\n\nThe color singlet state is:\n\nIn words, if one could measure the color of the state, there would be equal probabilities of it being red-antired, blue-antiblue, or green-antigreen.\n\nThere are eight remaining independent color states, which correspond to the \"eight types\" or \"eight colors\" of gluons. Because states can be mixed together as discussed above, there are many ways of presenting these states, which are known as the \"color octet\". One commonly used list is:\n\nThese are equivalent to the Gell-Mann matrices. The critical feature of these particular eight states is that they are linearly independent, and also independent of the singlet state, hence 3 − 1 or 2. There is no way to add any combination of these states to produce any other, and it is also impossible to add them to make r, g, or b the forbidden singlet state. There are many other possible choices, but all are mathematically equivalent, at least equally complicated, and give the same physical results.\n\nTechnically, QCD is a gauge theory with SU(3) gauge symmetry. Quarks are introduced as spinors in \"N\" flavors, each in the fundamental representation (triplet, denoted 3) of the color gauge group, SU(3). The gluons are vectors in the adjoint representation (octets, denoted 8) of color SU(3). For a general gauge group, the number of force-carriers (like photons or gluons) is always equal to the dimension of the adjoint representation. For the simple case of SU(\"N\"), the dimension of this representation is .\n\nIn terms of group theory, the assertion that there are no color singlet gluons is simply the statement that quantum chromodynamics has an SU(3) rather than a U(3) symmetry. There is no known \"a priori\" reason for one group to be preferred over the other, but as discussed above, the experimental evidence supports SU(3). The U(1) group for electromagnetic field combines with a slightly more complicated group known as SU(2) – S stands for \"special\" – which means the corresponding matrices have determinant 1 in addition to being unitary.\n\nSince gluons themselves carry color charge, they participate in strong interactions. These gluon-gluon interactions constrain color fields to string-like objects called \"flux tubes\", which exert constant force when stretched. Due to this force, quarks are confined within composite particles called hadrons. This effectively limits the range of the strong interaction to meters, roughly the size of an atomic nucleus. Beyond a certain distance, the energy of the flux tube binding two quarks increases linearly. At a large enough distance, it becomes energetically more favorable to pull a quark-antiquark pair out of the vacuum rather than increase the length of the flux tube.\n\nGluons also share this property of being confined within hadrons. One consequence is that gluons are not directly involved in the nuclear forces between hadrons. The force mediators for these are other hadrons called mesons.\n\nAlthough in the normal phase of QCD single gluons may not travel freely, it is predicted that there exist hadrons that are formed entirely of gluons — called glueballs. There are also conjectures about other exotic hadrons in which real gluons (as opposed to virtual ones found in ordinary hadrons) would be primary constituents. Beyond the normal phase of QCD (at extreme temperatures and pressures), quark–gluon plasma forms. In such a plasma there are no hadrons; quarks and gluons become free particles.\n\nQuarks and gluons (colored) manifest themselves by fragmenting into more quarks and gluons, which in turn hadronize into normal (colorless) particles, correlated in jets. As shown in 1978 summer conferences, the PLUTO detector at the electron-positron collider DORIS (DESY) produced the first evidence that the hadronic decays of the very narrow resonance Υ(9.46) could be interpreted as three-jet event topologies produced by three gluons. Later, published analyses by the same experiment confirmed this interpretation and also the spin 1 nature of the gluon (see also the recollection and PLUTO experiments).\n\nIn summer 1979, at higher energies at the electron-positron collider PETRA (DESY), again three-jet topologies were observed, now interpreted as q gluon bremsstrahlung, now clearly visible, by TASSO, \nMARK-J \nand PLUTO experiments (later in 1980 also by JADE). The spin 1 of the gluon was confirmed in 1980 by TASSO and PLUTO experiments (see also the review). In 1991 a subsequent experiment at the LEP storage ring at CERN again confirmed this result.\n\nThe gluons play an important role in the elementary strong interactions between quarks and gluons, described by QCD and studied particularly at the electron-proton collider HERA at DESY. The number and momentum distribution of the gluons in the proton (gluon density) have been measured by two experiments, H1 and ZEUS, in the years 1996-2007. The gluon contribution to the proton spin has been studied by the HERMES experiment at HERA. The gluon density in the proton (when behaving hadronically) also has been measured.\n\nColor confinement is verified by the failure of free quark searches (searches of fractional charges). Quarks are normally produced in pairs (quark + antiquark) to compensate the quantum color and flavor numbers; however at Fermilab single production of top quarks has been shown (technically this still involves a pair production, but quark and antiquark are of different flavor). No glueball has been demonstrated.\n\nDeconfinement was claimed in 2000 at CERN SPS in heavy-ion collisions, and it implies a new state of matter: quark–gluon plasma, less interacting than in the nucleus, almost as in a liquid. It was found at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven in the years 2004–2010 by four contemporaneous experiments. A quark–gluon plasma state has been confirmed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the three experiments ALICE, ATLAS and CMS in 2010.\n\nThe Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility at Jefferson Lab, also called the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, in Newport News, Virginia, is one of 10 Department of Energy facilities doing research on gluons. The Virginia lab is competing with another facility on Long Island, New York, Brookhaven National Laboratory, for funds to build a new electron-ion collider.\n"}

It was equal to four pecks or two and a half bushels, but was also often used as a unit of weight, which varied depending on the material being measured. The hobbit remained in customary use in markets in northern Wales after Parliament standardized the Winchester bushel as the unit of measure for grain, after which courts gave inconsistent rulings as to its legal status.\n\nThe hobbit was defined as a measure of volume, two and a half imperial bushels, but in practice it was often used as a unit of weight for specific goods. According to George Richard Everitt, Inspector of Corn Returns for Denbigh in northern Wales, when examined by the House of Commons in 1888, grains were sold by the hobbit, measured by weight. A hobbit of oats weighed 105 pounds, a hobbit of barley 147 pounds, and a hobbit of wheat 168 pounds. The figures in hobbits were then converted to standard imperial bushels for official reporting.\nIn addition to grains, there was also a hobbit of beans at 180 pounds, and in Flintshire, a 200-pound hobbit of old potatoes, or\n210 pounds of new potatoes.\nAround 1600, Welsh farmland was sometimes denominated by its productive capacity or \"measure of seedness\" instead of its physical area, so that in at least one case a plot was registered as\n\"a hobbett of land\", that is, large enough to grow one hobbit of grain per year.\n\nAlready in 1863, the hobbit was used as an example of the \"customary confusion in our British weights and measures\". An anonymous contributor to Charles Dickens's journal All the Year Round, arguing in favour of the decimal metric system,\nnoted that\n\nIf [I buy wheat] at Wrexham, [I must order] by the hobbet of one hundred and sixty eight [pounds]. But, even if I do happen to know what a hobbet of wheat means at Wrexham, that knowledge good for Flint is not good for Caernarvonshire. A hobbet of wheat at Pwlheli contains eighty-four pounds more than a hobbet at Wrexham; and a hobbet of oats is something altogether different; and a hobbet of barley is something altogether different again.\n\nThere was some dispute about the legality of the hobbit as a non-standard measure in commerce after Parliament established the Winchester measure. The hobbit's mixed use as a unit of both volume and of weight complicated the issue, as laws applied to the two cases differently. Courts sometimes nullified grain contracts denominated in hobbits, and sometimes upheld them, according to varying customs in precisely how hobbits were defined and measured.\n\nIn 1825, the Exchequer of Pleas heard the case of \"Tyson v. Thomas\", regarding an unfulfilled 1823 contract for the delivery of 20 hobbits of barley in Llanrwst, at 10 shillings each. The price of barley subsequently increased, and the seller did not make delivery. The buyer sued, and the defendant argued that the contract was illegal because it was not based on the standard Winchester bushel. According to testimony, the Llanrwst market used a half-hobbit measure of two 21-quart pecks, but in practice a hobbit could vary from 80 to 84 quarts. The court agreed with the seller, finding that the hobbit was impermissible because it was not a fixed integer multiple of the bushel.\nThe contract was therefore void. A similar argument was raised before the Exchequer of Pleas in \"Owens v. Denton\", concerning a sale of malt, but the court held that the question of measures had no effect on the case because the account had\nalready been settled.\n\nThe 1852 case \"Hughes v. Humphreys\" concerned a contract for the sale of 100 hobbits of wheat at 18 shillings per hobbit. Following custom, the grain was actually delivered in sacks weighed out to 252 pounds each, and converted to 168-pound hobbits. The seller sued to obtain payment from the buyer, who argued that the contract was unenforceable because the hobbit was a non-standard and illegal measure of volume, contrary to Parliamentary establishment of the Winchester bushel for trade in grain. The magistrate at the local assizes in Flintshire, J. Williams, found for the defendant, voiding the contract. This ruling was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench, which reasoned that the in distinction to the \"Tyson\" case, the hobbit in this instance was used as a measure of weight, not volume, and was defined as a fixed multiple of the pound. Because the sale of grain in pounds was allowed, the contract was deemed valid and was enforced.\n"}

It is an engineering reinforcement system for floors, walls, and ceilings of buildings and houses. This product is a derivative of the Kahn Trussed Bar for beams and columns that was invented by Julius Kahn. Kahn engineered the Hy-Rib products and they were first manufactured in 1909.\n\nHy-Rib is a steel encasement stiffened by rigid ribs used in reinforced walls, ceilings, and floors. They are helical hooping units of steel sheathing forms used in concrete, stucco and plaster. Hy-Rib products are a derivative of the \"wings\" used in the patented Kahn System of reinforced concrete, invented by Julius Kahn in 1903. The products are made from a single plate of steel. Hy-Rib products were used in concrete doors, ceilings, and roofs. It was also used in sidings, partitions and ceilings to eliminate channels. Hy-Rib products were designed to take on plaster and cement to eliminate layout forms in the construction of buildings. The steel sheet form would be embedded with plaster or cement directly and would flow into the lath surface to attach itself to the steel and harden to secure the material into the steel.\n\nHy-Rib products came in steel sheathing forms that could be bent, cut and connected together to make various size floors, walls, and ceilings. They were designed with the idea to reduce weight as compared to wood structures of the same building size. The steel forms of sheathing were stiffened by rigid high ribs and a complete unit was made with a single sheet of steel. This technique increased floor space because it cut down on center posts that were normally used in wood structured buildings. The Hy-Rib reinforced concrete floors, ceilings and walls were fireproof, being a major safety factor over wooden structures. The Packard automobile factory plant building number 10 is a demonstration of Hy-Rib product application of this reinforced concrete technique. This was the first time reinforced concrete products were used for automobile factory construction.\n\nHy-Rib products are used in the construction of tunnels, conduits, flumes, culverts, silos, cisterns, chimneys, and water tanks. For these applications the lath sheet products come in curved steel sheets. They are locked together to form a complete tube or tunnel on site. The curved sheets are stood on edge in the case of silos, water tanks, cisterns, and chimneys. The connected form then is plastered with cement. In some cases a few steel rods are added for extra strength and connecting purposes.\n\nHy-Rib products are used in flooring due to its ability to interlock prefabricated pieces. It has plaster applied to the underside creating the ceiling. The top would have wet cement poured on it to form the floor above. If the floor were required to carry heavy loads the Hy-Rib sheathing material could be bent into an arch to provide additional strength and then wet cement could poured as usual on top to make a floor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18511733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18511733", "title": "Hydrail", "text": "Hydrail\n\nHydrail is the generic (not capitalized) adjective term describing all forms of rail vehicles, large or small, which use on-board hydrogen as a source of energy to power the traction motors, or the auxiliaries, or both. Hydrail vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy, either by burning hydrogen in a hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle, or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling rail transportation is a basic element of the proposed hydrogen economy. The term is used extensively by research scholars and technicians around the world.\n\nHydrail vehicles are usually hybrid vehicles with renewable energy storage, such as batteries or super capacitors, for regenerative braking, improving efficiency and lowering the amount of hydrogen storage required. Potential hydrail applications include all types of rail transport: commuter rail; passenger rail; freight rail; light rail; rail rapid transit; mine railways; industrial railway systems; trams; and special rail rides at parks and museums.\n\nThe term hydrail was first mentioned on August 22, 2003, in an invited presentation at the US Department of Transportation’s Volpe Transportations Systems Center in Cambridge, MA. There, Stan Thompson, a former futurist and strategic planner at US telecoms company AT&T gave a presentation entitled the Mooresville Hydrail Initiative. However, according to authors Stan Thompson and Jim Bowman, the term first appeared in print on 17 February 2004 in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy as a search engine target word to enable scholars and technicians around the world working in the hydrogen rail area to more easily publish and locate all work produced within the discipline.\n\nSince 2005, annual International Hydrail Conferences have been held. Organised by Appalachian State University and the Mooresville South Iredell Chamber of Commerce in conjunction with universities and other entities, the Conferences have the aim of bringing together scientists, engineers, business leaders, industrial experts, and operators working or using the technology around the world in order to expedite deployment of the technology for environmental, climate, energy security and economic development reasons. Presenters at these conferences have included national and state/provincial agencies from the USA, Austria, Canada, China, Denmark, the EU, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United Nations (UNIDO-ICHET). In its early years, these conferences were largely dominated by academic fields; however, by 2013, an increasing number of businesses and industrial figures have reportedly been in attendance.\n\nDuring the 2010s, both fuel cells and hydrogen generation equipment have been taken up by several transport operators across various countries, such as China, Germany, Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Many of the same technologies that can be applied to hydrail vehicles can be applied to other forms of transport as well, such as road vehicles.\n\nHydrogen is a common and easy to find element, being that water has two molecules of hydrogen for every oxygen molecule present. Hydrogen can be separated from water via several means, including steam reforming (normally involving the use of fossil fuels) and electrolysis (which requires large amounts of electricity). Once isolated, hydrogen can serve as a form of fuel. It has been proposed that hydrogen for fuelling hydrail vehicles can be produced in individual maintenance depots, requiring only a steady supply of electricity and water; it can then be pumped into pressurised tanks upon the vehicle.\n\nThe development of lighter and more capable fuel cells has increased the viability of hydrogen-powered vehicles. According to Canadian company Hydrogenics, in 2001, its 25kW fuel cell weighed 290kg and had an efficiency ranging between 38 and 45 per cent; however, by 2017, they were producing more powerful and compact fuel cells weighing 72kg and with an efficiency between 48 and 55 per cent, a roughly fivefold increase in energy density. According to Rail Engineer, the use of hydrogen propulsion on certain types of trains, such as freight locomotives or high-speed trains, is less attractive and more challenging than on lower-powered applications, such as shunting locomotives and multiple units. The publication also observes that pressure to cut emissions within the railway industry is likely to play a role in stimulating demand for the uptake of hydrail.\n\nA key technology of a typical hydrogen propulsion system is the fuel cell. This device converts the chemical energy contained within the hydrogen in order to generate electricity, as well as water and heat. As such, a fuel cell would operate in a manner that is essentially inverse to the electrolysis process used to create the fuel; consuming pure hydrogen to produce electricity rather than consuming electrical energy to produce hydrogen, albeit incurring some level of energy losses in the exchange. Reportedly, the efficiency of converting electricity to hydrogen and back again is just beneath 30 per cent, roughly similar to contemporary diesel engines but less than conventional electric traction using overhead catenary wires. The electricity produced by the onboard fuel cell would be fed into a motor to propel the train.\n\nRailway industrial publication Railway Engineer has theorised that the expanding prevalence of wind power has led to some countries having surpluses of electrical energy during nighttime hours, and that this trend could offer a means of low-cost and highly available energy with which hydrogen could be conveniently produced via electrolysis. In this manner, it is believed that the production of hydrogen using off-peak electricity available from countries' electrical grids shall likely be one of the most economic practices available. As of January 2017, hydrogen produced via electrolysis commonly costs roughly the same as natural gas and almost double that of diesel fuel; however, unlike either of these fossil-based fuels, hydrogen propulsion produces zero emissions.\n\nAccording to Rail Engineer and Alstom, a 10MW wind farm is capable of comfortably producing 2.5 tonnes of hydrogen per day; enough to power a fleet of 14 iLint trains over a distance of 600km per day. Reportedly, as of January 2017, production of hydrogen worldwide has been expanding in quantity and availability, increasing its attractiveness as a fuel. The need to build up a capable distribution network for hydrogen, which in turn requires substantial investments to be made, is likely to play a role in restraining the growth of hydrail at least in the short term.\n\nIt was observed by Railway Technology that the rail industry has been historically slow to adopt new technologies and relatively conservative in outlook; however, a successful large-scale deployment of this technology by an early adopter may be decisive in overcoming attitudes of reluctance and traditionalism. Additionally, there could be significant benefits to transitioning from diesel to hydrail propulsion. According to the results of a study performed by a consortium of Hitachi Rail Europe, the University of Birmingham, and Fuel Cell Systems Ltd, hydrail vehicles in the form of re-powered diesel multiple units could be capable of generating significant energy consumption reductions; reportedly, their model indicated a saving of up to 52 per cent on the Norwich to Sheringham line over conventional traction.\n\nA \"hydrolley\" is a term for a streetcar or tram (trolley) powered by hydrail technology. The term (for \"hydro\"gen tro\"lley\") was coined at the Fourth International Hydrail Conference, Valencia, Spain, in 2008, as a research-simplifying search engine target word. Onboard hydrogen-derived power eliminates the need for overhead trolley arms and track electrification, greatly reducing construction cost, reducing visual pollution and eliminating the maintenance expense of track electrification. The term 'hydrolley' is preferred to 'hydrail light rail' or other combinations which might connote external electrification.\n\nHydrogen is highly combustible.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "386598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=386598", "title": "London Stone", "text": "London Stone\n\nLondon Stone is a historic landmark housed at 111 Cannon Street in the City of London. It is an irregular block of oolitic limestone measuring 53 × 43 × 30 cm (21 × 17 × 12\"), the remnant of a once much larger object that had stood for many centuries on the south side of the street.\n\nThe name \"London Stone\" was first recorded around the year 1100. The date and original purpose of the Stone are unknown, although it is possibly of Roman origin, and there has been interest and speculation about it since at least the 16th century. There are modern claims that it was formerly an object of veneration, or has some occult significance. These assertions, however, are completely unsubstantiated.\n\nThe present London Stone is only the upper portion of a once much larger object, as described below under History. The surviving portion is a block of oolitic limestone approximately 53 cm wide, 43 cm high, and 30 cm front to back (21 × 17 × 12 inches). A study in the 1960s indicated that the stone is Clipsham Limestone, a good-quality stone from Rutland transported to London for building purposes in both the Roman and medieval periods. More recently, Kevin Hayward has suggested that it may be Bath stone, the stone most used for monuments and sculpture in early Roman London and in Saxon times.\n\nBetween 1962 and 2016 London Stone was on the north side of Cannon Street, opposite Cannon Street station, in an aperture in the wall of 111 Cannon Street (London EC4N 5AR), surrounded by a decorative Portland stone fascia with an iron grille. Inside the building it was protected by a glass case. The stone and its surround, with the iron grille, were designated a Grade II* listed structure on 5 June 1972.\n\nA bronze plaque on the sloping top of the casing, dating from 1962, read:\nThis is a fragment of the original piece of limestone once securely fixed in the ground now fronting Cannon Street Station.\n\nRemoved in 1742 to the north side of the street, in 1798 it was built into the south wall of the Church of St. Swithun London Stone which stood here until demolished in 1962.\n\nIts origin and purpose are unknown but in 1188 there was a reference to Henry, son of Eylwin de Lundenstane, subsequently Lord Mayor of London.\nWhen London Stone was erected and what its original function was are unknown, although there has been much speculation.\n\nThe stone was originally on the south side of medieval Candlewick Street (since widened to create modern Cannon Street) opposite the west end of St Swithin's Church, and is shown in this position on the \"Copperplate\" map of London, dating to the 1550s, and on the derivative \"Woodcut\" map of the 1560s. It was described by the London historian John Stow in 1598 as \"a great stone called London stone\", \"pitched upright... fixed in the ground verie deep, fastned with bars of iron\". Stow does not give the dimensions of this \"great stone\", but a French visitor to London in 1578 had recorded that the Stone was three feet high (above ground), two feet wide, and one foot thick (90 × 60 × 30 cm). Thus, although it was a local landmark, London Stone, at least that part of it standing above ground, was not particularly impressive.\n\nThe earliest reference to it is usually said to be that noted by John Stow, in his \"Survey of London\" (1598). Stow says that in a list of properties in London belonging to Christ Church, Canterbury (Canterbury Cathedral), one piece of land was described as lying \"neare unto London stone\". This list, he says, had been bound into the end of a Gospel Book given to the cathedral by \"\"Ethelstane\" king of the west Saxons\", usually identified as Æthelstan, king of England (924–39). But it is impossible to confirm Stow's account, since the document he saw cannot now be identified with certainty. However, the earliest extant list of Canterbury's London properties, which has been dated to between 1098 and 1108, does refer to a property given to the cathedral by a man named \"Eadwaker æt lundene stane\" (\"Eadwaker at London Stone\"). Although not bound into a Gospel Book (it is now bound into a volume of miscellaneous medieval texts with a Canterbury provenance (MS Cotton Faustina B. vi) in the British Library), it could be that it was this, or a similar text, that Stow saw.\n\nLike Eadwaker, other medieval Londoners acquired or adopted the byname \"at London Stone\" or \"of London Stone\" because they lived nearby. One of these was \"Ailwin of London Stone\", the father of Henry Fitz-Ailwin the first Mayor of the City of London, who took office at some time between 1189 and 1193, and governed the city until his death in 1212. The Fitz-Ailwin house stood away from Candlewick Street, on the north side of St Swithin's church.\n\nLondon Stone was a well-known landmark in medieval London, and when in 1450 Jack Cade, leader of a rebellion against the corrupt government of Henry VI, entered the city with his men, he struck his sword on London Stone and claimed to be \"Lord of this city\". Contemporary accounts give no clue as to Cade's motivation, or how his followers or the Londoners would have interpreted his action. There is nothing to suggest he was carrying out a traditional ceremony or custom.\n\nBy the time of Queen Elizabeth I London Stone was not merely a landmark, shown and named on maps, but a visitor attraction in its own right. Tourists may have been told variously that it had stood there since before the city existed, or that it had been set up by order of King Lud, legendary rebuilder of London, or that it marked the centre of the city, or that it was \"set [up] for the tendering and making of payment by debtors\". In 1608 it was listed in a poem by Samuel Rowlands as one of the \"sights\" of London (perhaps the first time the word was used in that sense) shown to \"an honest Country foole\" on a visit to town.\n\nDuring the 17th century the Stone continued be used as an \"address\", to identify a locality. Thus, for example, Thomas Heywood's biography of Queen Elizabeth I, \"Englands Elizabeth\" (1631), was, according to its title page, \"printed by Iohn Beale, for Phillip Waterhouse; and are to be sold at his shop at St. Pauls head, neere London stone\"; and the \"English Short Title Catalogue\" lists over 30 books published between 1629 and the 1670s with similar references to London Stone in the imprint.\n\nIn 1671 the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers broke up a batch of substandard spectacles on London Stone: \"two and twenty dozen [= 264] of English spectacles, all very badd both in the glasse and frames not fitt to be put on sale... were found badd and deceitful and by judgement of the Court condemned to be broken, defaced and spoyled both glasse and frame the which judgement was executed accordingly in Canning [Cannon] Street on the remayning parte of London Stone where the same were with a hammer broken in all pieces.\" The reference to \"\"the remayning parte\" of London Stone\" may suggest that it had been damaged and reduced in size, perhaps in the Great Fire of London five years earlier, which had destroyed St Swithin's church and the neighbouring buildings; it was later covered with a small stone cupola to protect it.\nIn 1598 John Stow had commented that \"if carts do run against it through negligence, the wheels be broken, and the stone itself unshaken\", and by 1742 it was considered an obstruction to traffic. The remaining part of the Stone was then moved, with its protective cupola, from the south side of the street to the north side, where it was first set beside the door of St Swithin's Church, which had been rebuilt by Christopher Wren after its destruction in the Great Fire. It was moved again in 1798 to the east end of the church's south wall, and finally in the 1820s set in an alcove in the centre of the wall within a solidly built stone frame set on a plinth, with a circular aperture through which the Stone itself could be seen. In 1869 the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society arranged for the installation of a protective iron grille and an explanatory inscription in Latin and English on the church wall above it.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries London Stone was regularly referred to in popular London histories and guidebooks, and visited by tourists. During his stay in England in the 1850s the American author Nathaniel Hawthorne recorded a visit to London Stone in his journal, noting the indentations on the top \"which are said to have been made by Jack Cade’s sword\". In 1937 Arthur Mee, founder of \"The Children's Newspaper\" and author of \"The King's England\" series of guidebooks, described it as \"a fragment of its old self [...] said by some to have been a stone set up in Stone Age days\". The American archaeologist George Byron Gordon was more expansive (and fanciful) in the course of his \"Rambles in Old London\", published in 1924. London Stone, he tells us, was \"the very oldest object in London streets\". \"The Mediaeval Kings after their coronations used to strike London Stone with their swords in token of the City’s submission\" (followed of course by a reference to Jack Cade). \"It was an object of great antiquity when the Romans arrived and their predecessors the ancient Britons found it on their arrival more than two thousand years before. It was erected by the people of the New Stone Age [...].\"\n\nIn 1940 St Swithin's church was burnt out by bombing in the Blitz. However, the outer walls remained standing for many years, with London Stone still in its place in the south wall. In 1962 the remains of the church were demolished, and replaced by an office building, 111 Cannon Street, which originally housed the Bank of China; London Stone was placed without ceremony in the specially constructed grilled and glazed alcove in the new building.\n\nThe office building was long scheduled for redevelopment, and in October 2011 the then landowners proposed to move the stone to a new location further to the west. \n\nUntil February 2016 the ground floor of the building was occupied by a branch of WHSmith newsagents. Inside the shop London Stone in its glass case was hidden behind a magazine rack and not usually accessible.\n\nIn March 2016, planning permission was granted to allow the building to be demolished and replaced by a new one. The stone was put on display at the Museum of London while the building works were carried out and was returned in October 2018. The new Cannon Street premises publicly display London Stone on a plinth.\n\nIn 1598 the London historian John Stow admitted that \"The cause why this stone was set there, the time when, or other memory hereof, is none\". However, his contemporary William Camden, in \"Britannia\" (1586), his historical description of Great Britain, concluded that it was a Roman \"milliarium\", a central stone from which all distances in Roman Britain were measured, and similar to the Milliarium Aureum of Rome. This identification remains popular, although there is no archaeological evidence to support it. Camden's identification has been revived by John Michell in his book \"The Sacred Centre\" (2009), where he identifies the stone as the London \"terminus\", a stone sacred to Jupiter that stood at the centre of every Roman city, and which parallels the golden milestone in the Forum in Rome. He believes it was at the intersection of the major axes of the Roman city, the north south \"Cardo Maximus\" and the east west \"Decumanus\".\n\nAlternatively, writers in the 18th century speculated that the Stone was prehistoric and had been an object of Druidic worship. Although this suggestion is now generally dismissed, it was revived in 1914 by Elizabeth Gordon in her unorthodox book on the archaeology of prehistoric London, \"Prehistoric London: Its Mounds and Circles\", in which she envisaged London Stone as an ancient British \"index stone\" pointing to a great Druidic stone circle, similar to Stonehenge, that she claimed had once stood on the site of St Paul’s Cathedral. As we have seen, in 1924 American archaeologist George Byron Gordon claimed a \"New Stone Age\" date for it, but such claims do not find favour with modern archaeologists.\n\nBy the early 19th century, a number of writers had suggested that London Stone was once regarded as London's \"Palladium\", a talismanic monument in which, like the original Palladium of Troy, the city's safety and wellbeing were embodied. This view seemed to be confirmed when a pseudonymous contributor to the journal \"Notes and Queries\" in 1862 quoted a supposedly ancient proverb about London Stone to the effect that \"So long as the Stone of Brutus is safe, so long shall London flourish\". \nThis verse, if it were genuine, would link London Stone to Brutus of Troy, legendary founder of London, as well as confirming its role as a Palladium.\n\nHowever, the writer in \"Notes and Queries\" can be identified as the Revd Richard Williams Morgan, an eccentric Welsh clergyman who in an earlier book \"The British Kymry or Britons of Cambria\" (1857) had claimed that the legendary Brutus was a historical figure; London Stone, he wrote, had been the plinth on which the original Trojan Palladium had stood, and was brought to Britain by Brutus and set up as the altar stone of the Temple of Diana in his new capital city of Trinovantum or \"New Troy\" (London). This story, and the verse about the \"Stone of Brutus\", can be found nowhere any earlier than in Morgan's writings, and it seems safe to assume that both are his own invention. No-one before Morgan had called London Stone \"The Stone of Brutus\", and although the spurious verse is still frequently quoted, there is no evidence that London's safety has ever traditionally been linked to that of London Stone.\n\nIn 1881 Henry Charles Coote argued that London Stone's name and reputation arose simply because it was the last remaining fragment of the house of Henry Fitz-Ailwin of London Stone (\"ca.\" 1135–1212), the first Mayor, although London Stone was mentioned about 100 years before Henry's time, and the Fitz-Ailwin house was some distance from the Stone on the other side of St Swithin's church.\n\nIn 1890 the folklorist and London historian George Laurence Gomme proposed that London Stone was the city's original \"fetish stone\", erected when the first prehistoric settlement was founded on the site and treated as sacred ever after. Later, folklorist Lewis Spence combined this theory with Richard Williams Morgan's story of the \"Stone of Brutus\" to speculate about the pre-Roman origins of London in his book \"Legendary London\" (1937).\n\nBy the 1960s, archaeologists had noted that in its original location London Stone would have been aligned on the centre of a large Roman building, probably an administrative building, now known to have lain in the area of Cannon Street station. This has been tentatively identified as a \"praetorium\", even the local \"governor's palace\". It has further been suggested – originally by the archaeologist Peter Marsden, who excavated there between 1961 and 1972 – that the Stone may have formed part of its main entrance or gate. This \"\"praetorium\" gate theory\", while impossible to prove, is the prevailing one among modern experts.\n\nLondon Stone has been identified as a \"mark-stone\" on several ley lines passing through central London. It has also entered the psychogeographical writings of Iain Sinclair (born 1943) as an essential element in London's \"sacred geometry\".\n\nThere are two recent additions to the mythology surrounding London Stone. The first claims that Dr John Dee, astrologer, occultist and adviser to Queen Elizabeth I, \"was fascinated by the supposed powers of the London Stone and lived close to it for a while\" and may have chipped pieces off it for alchemical experiments; the second that a legend identifies it as the stone from which King Arthur pulled the sword to reveal that he was rightful king. The first of these may have been inspired by the fictionalised John Dee of Peter Ackroyd's 1993 novel \"The House of Doctor Dee\" (see In literature below). Both these \"legends\" seem first to be recorded on the website h2g2 in 2002.\n\nSo familiar was London Stone to Londoners that from an early date it features in London literature and in stories set in London. Thus, in an often reprinted anonymous satirical poem of the early 15th century, \"London Lickpenny\" (sometimes attributed to John Lydgate), the protagonist, lost and bewildered, passes London Stone during his wanderings through the city streets:\n<poem>Then went I forth by London Stone\nThrwgheout all Canywike Strete...</poem>\nIn about 1522 a pamphlet was published by the London printer Wynkyn de Worde with the long title: \"A Treatyse of a Galaunt, with the Maryage of the Fayre Pusell the Bosse of Byllyngesgate Unto London Stone\". It comprised two anonymous humorous poems, the second of which, \"The Maryage...\", just two pages in length, purports to be an invitation to the forthcoming wedding between London Stone and the \"Bosse of Billingsgate\", a water fountain near Billingsgate erected or renovated in the 1420s under the terms of the will of the mayor Richard Whittington. Guests are invited to watch the couple dancing – \"It wolde do you good to see them daunce and playe.\" The text, however, goes on to suggest that both London Stone and the Bosse were known for their steadfastness and reliability.\n\nLondon Stone also features in a tract \"The Returne of the renowned Caualiero Pasquill of England...\" published in 1589. Otherwise known as \"Pasquill and Marforius\" it was one of three that were printed under the pseudonym of the Cavaliero Pasquill, and contributed to the Marprelate controversy, a war of words between the Church of England establishment and its critics. At the end of this short work, Pasquill declares his intention of posting a notice on London Stone, inviting all critics of his opponent, the similarly pseudonymous Martin Marprelate, to write out their complaints and stick them up on the Stone. Some writers have argued that this fictional episode proves that London Stone was a traditional place for making official proclamations,\n\nThe Jack Cade episode was dramatised in William Shakespeare's \"Henry VI, Part 2\" (Act 4, Scene 6), first performed in 1591 or 1592. In Shakespeare's elaborated version of the event, Cade strikes London Stone with a staff rather than a sword, then seats himself upon the Stone as if on a throne, to issue decrees and dispense rough justice to a follower who displeases him.\n\nIn 1598, London Stone was again brought to the stage, in William Haughton's comedy \"Englishmen for My Money\", when three foreigners, being led about on stage through the supposedly pitch-black night-time streets of London, blunder into it.\n\nLater, London Stone was to play an important but not always consistent role in the visionary writings of William Blake. Thus in \"\", his long illustrated poem on engraved plates begun in 1804, London Stone is a Druidic altar, the site of bloody sacrifices. Alternatively in \"Jerusalem\" and in \"Milton a Poem\" it is the geographic centre of Golgonooza, Blake's mystical city of London; it is a place where justice is delivered, where Los sits to hear the voice of Jerusalem, and where Reuben sleeps.\n\nIn the last years of the 20th century and the early years of the 21st, London Stone has made an increasing number of appearances in novels of imagination and fantasy. In Peter Ackroyd's novel \"The House of Doctor Dee\", the character Dr Dee, broadly based upon the historical figure of the occultist John Dee, claims that London Stone is the last remnant above ground of a glorious antediluvian and now buried city of London that he is searching for. London Stone appears as an embodiment of evil in Charlie Fletcher's trilogy for children \"Stoneheart\". It also features in \"The Midnight Mayor\", Kate Griffin's second Matthew Swift novel about urban magic in London, and in China Miéville's \"Kraken\", in which it is the beating heart of London and the sports shop that houses it hides the headquarters of the \"Londonmancers\" who may know the whereabouts of the Kraken stolen from the Natural History Museum. The third of a series of fantasy novels for children \"The Nowhere Chronicles\" by Sarah Pinborough, writing as Sarah Silverwood, is entitled \"The London Stone\": \"The London Stone has been stolen and the Dark King rules the Nowhere...\" In Marie Brennan's \"Onyx Court\" series, the Stone is part of the magical bond between the mortal Prince of the Stone and the fairie court beneath London. It is also mentioned in Nicci French's crime novel \"Tuesday's Gone\".\n\nThe stone appears in several chapters of Edward Rutherfurd's novel, \"London\" (1997). In the second chapter we see it as the marker stone for all the roads in Roman Londinium, and also sitting beside the wall of the Governor's Palace as mentioned above as a hypothesis of its use or origin. It is seen again in the ninth chapter where the main family unit of the novel bring in the character of the foundling who is found propped up against it. The stone is one of the many central focus points in the novel that the author uses to tie the different time periods together.\n\nRay Nelson's science fiction novel \"Blake's Progress\" (1975), based on the writings of William Blake, features an alternative history in which Cleopatra won the Battle of Actium and an Alexandrian Empire replaced the Roman Empire. In the alternate London, called Gogonooza, London Stone is still to be seen, standing in front of a Temple of Isis.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18087", "title": "Lonsdaleite", "text": "Lonsdaleite\n\nLonsdaleite (named in honour of Kathleen Lonsdale), also called hexagonal diamond in reference to the crystal structure, is an allotrope of carbon with a hexagonal lattice. In nature, it forms when meteorites containing graphite strike the Earth. The great heat and stress of the impact transforms the graphite into diamond, but retains graphite's hexagonal crystal lattice. Lonsdaleite was first identified in 1967 from the Canyon Diablo meteorite, where it occurs as microscopic crystals associated with diamond.\n\nHexagonal diamond has also been synthesized in the laboratory (1966 or earlier; published in 1967) by compressing and heating graphite either in a static press or using explosives. It has also been produced by chemical vapor deposition, and also by the thermal decomposition of a polymer, poly(hydridocarbyne), at atmospheric pressure, under argon atmosphere, at .\n\nIt is translucent, brownish-yellow, and has an index of refraction of 2.40 to 2.41 and a specific gravity of 3.2 to 3.3. Its hardness is theoretically superior to that of cubic diamond (up to 58% more), according to computational simulations, but natural specimens exhibited somewhat lower hardness through a large range of values (from 7 to 8 on Mohs hardness scale). The cause is speculated as being due to the samples having been riddled with lattice defects and impurities.\n\nThe property of lonsdaleite as a discrete material has been questioned, since specimens under crystallographic inspection showed not a bulk hexagonal lattice, but instead cubic diamond dominated by structural defects that include hexagonal sequences. A quantitative analysis of the X-ray diffraction data of lonsdaleite has shown that about equal amounts of hexagonal and cubic stacking sequences are present. Consequently, it has been suggested that \"stacking disordered diamond\" is the most accurate structural description of lonsdaleite. On the other hand, recent shock experiments with in situ X-ray diffraction show strong evidence for creation of relatively pure lonsdaleite in dynamic high-pressure environments such as meteorite impacts.\n\nAccording to the traditional picture, Lonsdaleite has a hexagonal unit cell, related to the diamond unit cell in the same way that the hexagonal and cubic close packed crystal systems are related. The diamond structure can be considered to be made up of interlocking rings of six carbon atoms, in the chair conformation. In lonsdaleite, some rings are in the boat conformation instead. At the nanoscale dimensions cubic diamond is represented by diamondoids while hexagonal diamond is represented by wurtzoids. In diamond, all the carbon-to-carbon bonds, both within a layer of rings and between them, are in the staggered conformation, thus causing all four cubic-diagonal directions to be equivalent; while in lonsdaleite the bonds between layers are in the eclipsed conformation, which defines the axis of hexagonal symmetry.\n\nLonsdaleite is simulated to be 58% harder than diamond on the <100> face and to resist indentation pressures of 152 GPa, whereas diamond would break at 97 GPa. This is yet exceeded by IIa diamond's <111> tip hardness of 162 GPa.\n\nLonsdaleite occurs as microscopic crystals associated with diamond in several meteorites: Canyon Diablo, Kenna, and Allan Hills 77283. It is also naturally occurring in non-bolide diamond placer deposits in the Sakha Republic. Material with d-spacings consistent with Lonsdaleite has been found in sediments with highly uncertain dates at Lake Cuitzeo, in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico, by proponents of the controversial Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. Its presence in local peat deposits is claimed as evidence for the Tunguska event being caused by a meteor rather than by a cometary fragment.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23750", "title": "Paramagnetism", "text": "Paramagnetism\n\nParamagnetism is a form of magnetism whereby certain materials are weakly attracted by an externally applied magnetic field, and form internal, induced magnetic fields in the direction of the applied magnetic field. In contrast with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds; they have a relative magnetic permeability slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive magnetic susceptibility) and hence are attracted to magnetic fields. The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic materials are often conducted with a SQUID magnetometer.\n\nParamagnetism is due to the presence of unpaired electrons in the material, so all atoms with incompletely filled atomic orbitals are paramagnetic. Due to their spin, unpaired electrons have a magnetic dipole moment and act like tiny magnets. An external magnetic field causes the electrons' spins to align parallel to the field, causing a net attraction. Paramagnetic materials include aluminium, oxygen, titanium, and iron oxide (FeO).\n\nUnlike ferromagnets, paramagnets do not retain any magnetization in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field because thermal motion randomizes the spin orientations. (Some paramagnetic materials retain spin disorder even at absolute zero, meaning they are paramagnetic in the ground state, i.e. in the absence of thermal motion.) Thus the total magnetization drops to zero when the applied field is removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a small induced magnetization because only a small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnetic materials is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily observed, for instance, in the attraction between a refrigerator magnet and the iron of the refrigerator itself.\n\nConstituent atoms or molecules of paramagnetic materials have permanent magnetic moments (dipoles), even in the absence of an applied field. The permanent moment generally is due to the spin of unpaired electrons in atomic or molecular electron orbitals (see Magnetic moment). In pure paramagnetism, the dipoles do not interact with one another and are randomly oriented in the absence of an external field due to thermal agitation, resulting in zero net magnetic moment. When a magnetic field is applied, the dipoles will tend to align with the applied field, resulting in a net magnetic moment in the direction of the applied field. In the classical description, this alignment can be understood to occur due to a torque being provided on the magnetic moments by an applied field, which tries to align the dipoles parallel to the applied field. However, the true origins of the alignment can only be understood via the quantum-mechanical properties of spin and angular momentum.\n\nIf there is sufficient energy exchange between neighbouring dipoles, they will interact, and may spontaneously align or anti-align and form magnetic domains, resulting in ferromagnetism (permanent magnets) or antiferromagnetism, respectively. Paramagnetic behavior can also be observed in ferromagnetic materials that are above their Curie temperature, and in antiferromagnets above their Néel temperature. At these temperatures, the available thermal energy simply overcomes the interaction energy between the spins.\n\nIn general, paramagnetic effects are quite small: the magnetic susceptibility is of the order of 10 to 10 for most paramagnets, but may be as high as 10 for synthetic paramagnets such as ferrofluids.\n\nIn conductive materials, the electrons are delocalized, that is, they travel through the solid more or less as free electrons. Conductivity can be understood in a band structure picture as arising from the incomplete filling of energy bands.\nIn an ordinary nonmagnetic conductor the conduction band is identical for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. When a magnetic field is applied, the conduction band splits apart into a spin-up and a spin-down band due to the difference in magnetic potential energy for spin-up and spin-down electrons.\nSince the Fermi level must be identical for both bands, this means that there will be a small surplus of the type of spin in the band that moved downwards. This effect is a weak form of paramagnetism known as \"Pauli paramagnetism\".\n\nThe effect always competes with a diamagnetic response of opposite sign due to all the core electrons of the atoms. Stronger forms of magnetism usually require localized rather than itinerant electrons. However, in some cases a band structure can result in which there are two delocalized sub-bands with states of opposite spins that have different energies. If one subband is preferentially filled over the other, one can have itinerant ferromagnetic order. This situation usually only occurs in relatively narrow (d-)bands, which are poorly delocalized.\n\nGenerally, strong delocalization in a solid due to large overlap with neighboring wave functions means that there will be a large Fermi velocity; this means that the number of electrons in a band is less sensitive to shifts in that band's energy, implying a weak magnetism. This is why s- and p-type metals are typically either Pauli-paramagnetic or as in the case of gold even diamagnetic. In the latter case the diamagnetic contribution from the closed shell inner electrons simply wins over the weak paramagnetic term of the almost free electrons.\n\nStronger magnetic effects are typically only observed when d or f electrons are involved. Particularly the latter are usually strongly localized. Moreover, the size of the magnetic moment on a lanthanide atom can be quite large as it can carry up to 7 unpaired electrons in the case of gadolinium(III) (hence its use in MRI). The high magnetic moments associated with lanthanides is one reason why superstrong magnets are typically based on elements like neodymium or samarium.\n\nThe above picture is a \"generalization\" as it pertains to materials with an extended lattice rather than a molecular structure. Molecular structure can also lead to localization of electrons. Although there are usually energetic reasons why a molecular structure results such that it does not exhibit partly filled orbitals (i.e. unpaired spins), some non-closed shell moieties do occur in nature. Molecular oxygen is a good example. Even in the frozen solid it contains di-radical molecules resulting in paramagnetic behavior. The unpaired spins reside in orbitals derived from oxygen p wave functions, but the overlap is limited to the one neighbor in the O molecules. The distances to other oxygen atoms in the lattice remain too large to lead to delocalization and the magnetic moments remain unpaired.\n\nThe Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem proves that there cannot be any diamagnetism or paramagnetism in a purely classical system. The paramagnetic response has then two possible quantum origins, either coming from permanents magnetic moments of the ions or from the spatial motion of the conduction electrons inside the material. Both description are given below.\n\nFor low levels of magnetization, the magnetization of paramagnets follows what is known as Curie's law, at least approximately. This law indicates that the susceptibility, formula_1, of paramagnetic materials is inversely proportional to their temperature, i.e. that materials become more magnetic at lower temperatures. The mathematical expression is:\n\nwhere:\n\nCurie's law is valid under the commonly encountered conditions of low magnetization (\"μ\"\"H\" ≲ \"k\"\"T\"), but does not apply in the high-field/low-temperature regime where saturation of magnetization occurs (\"μ\"\"H\" ≳ \"k\"\"T\") and magnetic dipoles are all aligned with the applied field. When the dipoles are aligned, increasing the external field will not increase the total magnetization since there can be no further alignment.\n\nFor a paramagnetic ion with noninteracting magnetic moments with angular momentum \"J\", the Curie constant is related the individual ions' magnetic moments,\n\nwhere \"n\" is the number of atoms per unit volume. The parameter \"μ\" is interpreted as the effective magnetic moment per paramagnetic ion. If one uses a classical treatment with molecular magnetic moments represented as discrete magnetic dipoles, \"μ\", a Curie Law expression of the same form will emerge with \"μ\" appearing in place of \"μ\".\n\nWhen orbital angular momentum contributions to the magnetic moment are small, as occurs for most organic radicals or for octahedral transition metal complexes with d or high-spin d configurations, the effective magnetic moment takes the form ( with g-factor \"g\" = 2.0023... ≈ 2),\n\nwhere \"N\" is the number of unpaired electrons. In other transition metal complexes this yields a useful, if somewhat cruder, estimate.\n\nFor some alkali metals and noble metals, conductions electrons are weakly interacting and delocalized in space forming a Fermi gas. For these materials one contribution to the magnetic response comes from the interaction with the electron spins and the magnetic field known as Pauli paramagnetism. For a small magnetic field formula_10, the additional energy per electron added from the interaction between an electron spin and the magnetic field is given by:\n\nwhere formula_12 is the electron magnetic moment, formula_13 is the Bohr magneton, formula_14 is the reduced Planck constant, and the g-factor cancels with the spin formula_15. The formula_16 indicates that the sign is positive (negative) when the electron spin component in the direction of formula_10 is parallel (antiparallel) to the magnetic field.\nFor low temperatures with respect to the Fermi temperature formula_18 (around 10 kelvins for metals), the number density of electrons formula_19 (formula_20) pointing parallel (antiparallel) to the magnetic field can be written as:\n\nwith formula_22 the total free-electrons density and formula_23 the electronic density of states (number of states per energy per volume) at the Fermi energy formula_24. \n\nIn this approximation the magnetization is given as the magnetic moment of one electron times the difference in densities:\n\nwhich yields a positive paramagnetic susceptibility independent of temperature:\n\nThe Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility is a macroscopic effect and has to be contrasted with Landau diamagnetic susceptibility which is equal to minus one third of Pauli's and also comes from delocalized electrons. The Pauli susceptibility comes from the spin interaction with the magnetic field while the Landau susceptibility comes from the spatial motion of the electrons and it is independent of the spin. In doped semiconductors the ratio between Landau's and Pauli's susceptibilities changes as the effective mass of the charge carriers formula_27 can differ from the electron mass formula_28. \n\nThe magnetic response calculated for a gas of electrons is not the full picture as the magnetic susceptibility coming from the ions has to be included. Additionally, this formulas may break down for confined systems that differ from the bulk, like quantum dots, or for high fields, as demonstrated in the de Haas-van Alphen effect.\n\nPauli paramagnetism is named after the physicist Wolfgang Pauli. Before Pauli's theory, the lack of a strong Curie paramagnetism in metals was an open problem as the leading model could not account for this contribution without the use of quantum statistics.\n\nMaterials that are called \"paramagnets\" are most often those that exhibit, at least over an appreciable temperature range, magnetic susceptibilities that adhere to the Curie or Curie–Weiss laws. In principle any system that contains atoms, ions, or molecules with unpaired spins can be called a paramagnet, but the interactions between them need to be carefully considered.\n\nThe narrowest definition would be: a system with unpaired spins that \"do not interact\" with each other. In this narrowest sense, the only pure paramagnet is a dilute gas of monatomic hydrogen atoms. Each atom has one non-interacting unpaired electron. The latter could be said about a gas of lithium atoms but these already possess two paired core electrons that produce a diamagnetic response of opposite sign. Strictly speaking Li is a mixed system therefore, although admittedly the diamagnetic component is weak and often neglected. In the case of heavier elements the diamagnetic contribution becomes more important and in the case of metallic gold it dominates the properties. The element hydrogen is virtually never called 'paramagnetic' because the monatomic gas is stable only at extremely high temperature; H atoms combine to form molecular H and in so doing, the magnetic moments are lost (\"quenched\"), because of the spins pair. Hydrogen is therefore \"diamagnetic\" and the same holds true for many other elements. Although the electronic configuration of the individual atoms (and ions) of most elements contain unpaired spins, they are not necessarily paramagnetic, because at ambient temperature quenching is very much the rule rather than the exception. The quenching tendency is weakest for f-electrons because \"f\" (especially 4\"f\") orbitals are radially contracted and they overlap only weakly with orbitals on adjacent atoms. Consequently, the lanthanide elements with incompletely filled 4f-orbitals are paramagnetic or magnetically ordered.\nThus, condensed phase paramagnets are only possible if the interactions of the spins that lead either to quenching or to ordering are kept at bay by structural isolation of the magnetic centers. There are two classes of materials for which this holds:\n\nAs stated above, many materials that contain d- or f-elements do retain unquenched spins. Salts of such elements often show paramagnetic behavior but at low enough temperatures the magnetic moments may order. It is not uncommon to call such materials 'paramagnets', when referring to their paramagnetic behavior above their Curie or Néel-points, particularly if such temperatures are very low or have never been properly measured. Even for iron it is not uncommon to say that \"iron becomes a paramagnet\" above its relatively high Curie-point. In that case the Curie-point is seen as a phase transition between a ferromagnet and a 'paramagnet'. The word paramagnet now merely refers to the linear response of the system to an applied field, the temperature dependence of which requires an amended version of Curie's law, known as the Curie–Weiss law:\n\nThis amended law includes a term θ that describes the exchange interaction that is present albeit overcome by thermal motion. The sign of θ depends on whether ferro- or antiferromagnetic interactions dominate and it is seldom exactly zero, except in the dilute, isolated cases mentioned above.\n\nObviously, the paramagnetic Curie–Weiss description above \"T\" or \"T\" is a rather different interpretation of the word \"paramagnet\" as it does \"not\" imply the \"absence\" of interactions, but rather that the magnetic structure is random in the absence of an external field at these sufficiently high temperatures. Even if \"θ\" is close to zero this does not mean that there are no interactions, just that the aligning ferro- and the anti-aligning antiferromagnetic ones cancel. An additional complication is that the interactions are often different in different directions of the crystalline lattice (anisotropy), leading to complicated magnetic structures once ordered.\n\nRandomness of the structure also applies to the many metals that show a net paramagnetic response over a broad temperature range. They do not follow a Curie type law as function of temperature however, often they are more or less temperature independent. This type of behavior is of an itinerant nature and better called Pauli-paramagnetism, but it is not unusual to see, for example, the metal aluminium called a \"paramagnet\", even though interactions are strong enough to give this element very good electrical conductivity.\n\nSome materials show induced magnetic behavior that follows a Curie type law but with exceptionally large values for the Curie constants. These materials are known as superparamagnets. They are characterized by a strong ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic type of coupling into domains of a limited size that behave independently from one another. The bulk properties of such a system resembles that of a paramagnet, but on a microscopic level they are ordered. The materials do show an ordering temperature above which the behavior reverts to ordinary paramagnetism (with interaction). Ferrofluids are a good example, but the phenomenon can also occur inside solids, e.g., when dilute paramagnetic centers are introduced in a strong itinerant medium of ferromagnetic coupling such as when Fe is substituted in TlCuSe or the alloy AuFe. Such systems contain ferromagnetically coupled clusters that freeze out at lower temperatures. They are also called mictomagnets.\n\n\n\n"}

Planing is analogous to shaping. The main difference between these two processes is that in shaping the tool reciprocates across the stationary workpiece. Planing motion is the opposite of shaping. Both planing and shaping are rapidly being replaced by milling.\n\nThe mechanism used for this process is known as a planer. The size of the planer is determined by the largest workpiece that can be machined on it. The cutting tools are usually carbide tipped or made of high speed steel and resemble those used in facing and turning.\n\nIn shaping, the tool is brought into position with the workpiece. The tool then repeatedly moves in a straight line while the workpiece is incrementally fed into the line of motion of the tool, this produces a flat, smooth, and sculpted surface. For shaped pieces the tool reciprocates across the stationary workpiece. The tools are usually tilted or lifted after each stroke. This is done hydraulically or manually in order to prevent the tool surface from chipping when the workpiece travels back across.\n\nPlaning can be used to produce flat surfaces, as well as cross-sections with grooves and notches, are produced along the length of workpiece. Shaping is basically the same as planing, except the workpiece is usually smaller, and it is the tool that moves and not the workpiece.\nPlaning can be used to produce horizontal, vertical, or inclined flat surfaces on workpieces usually too large for shaping. Shaping is used not only for flat surfaces, but also for external or internal surfaces (either horizontal or inclined). Curved and irregular surfaces can also be produced by using special attachments\n\nFlat, angular, and contoured surfaces are made by horizontal shapers. Concerning shaping, the device that holds the piece being worked on has a very heavy movable jaw to withstand cutting forces. The size of the planer needed is determined by the workpiece. Depending on the size of the workpiece many clamps and supporting devices may be used to hold it on the planer.\n\nThe tools for shaping/planing are usually made of high speed steel or carbide tipped. Except for some slight angle difference, cutting tools resemble those used in facing and turning. Some advantages of using single-point cutting tools over multipoint tools is that they are more easily sharpened and fabricated. Internal shapes can be made by using a special extension tool. \nAlthough the most common material to be planed or shaped is wood, there are planers and shaping machines capable of processing anything from metal pieces to plastic objects.\n\n[1] Todd, Robert H and Allen, Dell K.

On such a chart the values of specific energy (in W·h/kg) are plotted versus specific power (in W/kg). Both axes are logarithmic, which allows comparing performance of very different devices (for example, extremely high and extremely low power).\n\nThe Ragone plot was first used to compare performance of batteries. However, it is suitable to compare any energy-storing devices, as is shown in the graph on the right. The plot is named after David V. Ragone.\n\nConceptually, the vertical axis describes how much energy is available, while the horizontal axis shows how quickly that energy can be delivered, otherwise known as power, per unit mass. A point in a Ragone plot thus represents the amount of time during which the energy (per mass) on the Y-axis can be delivered at the power (per mass) on the X-axis, and that time (in hours) is given as the ratio between the energy and the power densities. Consequently, the iso curves in a Ragone plot are straight lines with unity slope. For example, powering a small light bulb may require low amounts of power, but the power should be delivered steadily enough to operate a flashlight for minutes or hours of use. Conversely, a high-speed electronic switch inside a computer may require very little energy to activate; yet it must be delivered rapidly enough to complete the transaction in mere microseconds. These two types of loads would be represented at opposite corners of the Ragone plot.\n\nwhere \"V\" is voltage (V), \"I\" electric current (A), \"t\" time (s) and \"m\" mass (kg).\n"}
{"id": "2407365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2407365", "title": "Rickshaw art", "text": "Rickshaw art\n\nRickshaw art or auto art is a form of neo-romanticism emerging in the Indian subcontinent. \n\nThe art in question consists of oil paintings on the rear of the canvas roof of rickshaws, done by local street artists, who also paint the various landscape, portraits and personal statements of the driver.\n\nIn Bangladesh, rickshaw art dates back to the 1950s and every conceivable part of the rickshaw is painted. In addition to geometric designs, there are depictions of flowers, birds and even popular actresses. The rickshaw can be decorated to show the driver's religious beliefs and sometimes even a commentary on current social issues. In Bangladesh, rickshaw art is looked down upon by the elite population.\n\nThe three-wheeled pedicab, more commonly known as the rickshaw, has been around since the 1940s. Initially, they were undecorated, but starting in the late 1940s, the faces of movie stars began appearing as decorative motifs on shields at the back of the rickshaws along with a variety of floral paintings. The unique trend of rickshaw art started from Rajshahi and Dhaka in Bangladesh and took its own style in each district. For instance, Chittagong being a more pious city then Dhaka mostly had floral or scenery art whereas Comilla has plain rickshaws with beautiful dark blue or green hoods, on which are sewn an appliqué of a minaret or floral design enshrining the word \"Allah\".\n\nArtwork on the wheels of the rickshaws are done using very bold, bright and raw colours, like fluorescent green, dark red and so on. The blaze of colours also help to make them long lasting. \n\nAuthor Joanna Kirkpatrick states her definition of rickshaw art: \nI consider it \"peoples' art\". It is not necessary to force it into a unitary category as it combines folkloric, movie, political and commercial imagery and techniques. It serves the expression of heart's desires of the man in the street for women, power, wealth, as well as for religious devotion. Rickshaw art also serves prestige and economic functions for the people who make, use and enjoy it.\n\nRickshaw art also reflects the economic globalization process, which is occurring all over the world today, for instance those rickshaws with Osama Bin Laden's pictures. Rickshaws are not only painted but also decorated with tassels, tinsel and colourful plastic.\n\nRickshaw art covers the whole rickshaw decoration, from painted backboards and rear side panels to cut-outs appliquéd on to hoods, as well as brass vases replete with plastic or paper flowers. The painted rectangular metal board at the backside, between the two wheels, leaves a trail of passion that the Rickshaw artist puts in his creations.\n\nThis living pop art in Bangladesh is primarily created by illiterate rickshaw artists. They learn their techniques by living with Ustat (masters) from boyhood. They do not have copyrights, and in most cases are not attributed by name on their art. In the back of rickshaws however, there is generally a mark of the maker indicated by a bold steel pin, for example - \"Fazlu Mistri\". Today, rickshaw art and artists are in a 'struggle of existence'. Third and fourth generations are increasingly less interested in learning the art due to low incomes of two to three dollars a day as well as the lack of recognition.\n\nAs the genre of hand painted objects are dying down due to screen printing and other such technologies, a Bangladeshi artist called Biskut Abir, started his own art firm called Biskut Factory where he brought back rickshaw art and promoted it by hand painting on modern, innovative products. He uses patterns and colors from Rickshaw art and paints these vibrant images on sunglasses, clothes, shoes, phone cases and almost anything with a surface. His establishment is built on an artsy spirit and his love for rebelling against the system. Biskut lacks an academic background on designing or art, but has quite successfully proven that they can be redundant when talent persists. \n\nBy selling and advertising his eye catching art through social media, Biskut has been extremely successful in amusing the youth and bringing back rickshaw art with a twist of modern art.\n\n\n"}

He attended Temple University. He now lives in California with his wife Caroline Davis, the former wife of Leonard Tose. Kimmel is featured on \"Old Jews Telling Jokes\".\n\nKimmel and his wife Caroline bought Johnny Carson's former estate. They purchased the property that sits on the Point Dume promontory in Malibu, California in 2007 for $46 million. In 2017, they placed the property up for sale for $81.5 million. They reduced the price to $65.2 million in August of 2018.\n\nKimmel founded Jones Apparel Group in 1970 while working at W. R. Grace and Company. Five years later, he purchased the company with a partner. Notable lines produced by Kimmel include Jones New York, Evan-Picone, and 9 West; he also has licensing deals with Ralph Lauren. He stepped down as chief executive officer of Jones in 2002 and sold most of his shares in the publicly traded company, but remained chairman of the board of directors until the sale of the company to Sycamore Partners in 2014.

His goal is to donate $1 billion in total throughout his lifetime.\n\nIn 1993, Kimmel founded the Sidney Kimmel Foundation. The foundation's Cancer Research division pledged to contribute $120 million to institutions serving healthcare, education, arts and culture. Later, in 2001, the Sidney Kimmel Foundation for Cancer Research donated $150 million to Johns Hopkins University. The donation became the largest single gift ever received by the University, and was directed toward the development of a residence for cancer patients undergoing extended treatment. The gift inspired the university to name the residence the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. In total Kimmel has his name attached to four separate cancer-research centers in Philadelphia, San Diego and Baltimore. The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital as well as the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital carry his name. The Jefferson Medical College was renamed the Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in June 2014, following a $110 million grant from the Sidney Kimmel Foundation, the fifth-largest ever gift to a medical school. As of April 2003, Kimmel and the Sidney Kimmel Foundation had donated an estimated $400 million.\n\nKimmel has also contributed over $35 million to the center for the performing arts in Philadelphia, which is now named The Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts and is home to the world-renowned Philadelphia Orchestra. Other contributions from Kimmel include a $5 million donation to The National Constitution Center in Philadelphia; a $20 million donation to Raymond and Ruth Perelman Jewish Day School in Philadelphia and $25 million for the establishment of a new prostate and urological cancer center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York.

It occurred in July 1342 on and around the feast day of St. Mary Magdalene, 22 July.\n\nFollowing the passage of a Genoa low the rivers Rhine, Moselle, Main, Danube, Weser, Werra, Unstrut, Elbe, Vltava and their tributaries inundated large areas. Many towns such as Cologne, Mainz, Frankfurt am Main, Würzburg, Regensburg, Passau and Vienna were seriously damaged. Even the river Eider north of Hamburg flooded the surrounding land. The affected area extended to Carinthia and northern Italy.\n\nIt appears that after a prolonged hot and dry period continuous rainfalls occurred which lasted several consecutive days and amounted to more than half of the mean yearly precipitation. Since the dry soil was unable to absorb such amounts of water, the surface runoff washed away large areas of fertile soil and caused huge inundations destroying houses, mills and bridges. In Würzburg, the then famous \"Steinerne Brücke\" (\"Stone Bridge\") was taken away and in Cologne it is said that a rowing boat could pass over the city's fortifications. The overall number of casualties is not known, but it is believed that alone in the Danube area 6,000 people were killed. The results of the erosion can still be noticed today. The volume of the eroded soil during this short incident (a few days) is determined to be more than 13 billion metric tons, a volume that is washed away under normal climate conditions over a period of 2,000 years.\n\nIt is assumed that the loss of fertile soil led to a serious drop in agricultural production. In addition, the following summers were wet and cold, so that the population suffered from widespread famine. Whether the spreading of the Black Death between 1348 and 1350 killing at least a third of the population in central Europe was facilitated by the weakened condition of the population is a matter of discussion.\n\n"}
