His political ambitions, including an aspiration to become Prime Minister, were frustrated by bad timing; but his energies were diverted into industry: he spent a decade as chair of the National Coal Board, and later headed a major inquiry which resulted in the Robens Report on health, safety and welfare at work. His outlook was paternalistic, but in later life, he moved away from his early socialism towards the Conservative Party. His reputation remains tarnished by his failure to have foreseen and prevented the Aberfan disaster, followed by actions widely regarded as insensitive during this disaster's aftermath.\n\nRobens was born in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, the son of George Robens, a cotton salesman and Edith Robens (\"née\" Anderton). He left school aged 15 to work as an errand boy, but his career truly began when he joined the Manchester and Salford Co-operative Society as a clerk; he became a director when he was 22, one of the first worker/directors in the country. He was an official in the Union of Distributive and Allied Workers from 1935 to 1945; being certified medically unfit for military service in the Second World War, he served as a Manchester City Councillor from 1941 to 1945. He married Eva Powell on 9 September 1936; the couple adopted a son, Alfred (born 1935).\n\nFollowing the war, in the dramatic Labour landslide victory of 1945, Robens was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for the mining constituency of Wansbeck in Northumberland. He started on a sustained rise through the parliamentary ranks, serving in junior posts at the Ministry of Transport (1945–1947) and at the Ministry of Fuel and Power under Hugh Gaitskell. In 1950, following boundary changes, Robens moved to the new constituency of Blyth, later Blyth Valley. He was briefly Minister of Labour and National Service in 1951, but the Conservative Party won the general election later that year.\n\nIn opposition, Robens continued to rise in the party, being appointed Shadow Foreign Secretary by Clement Attlee while Aneurin Bevan was indisposed, and he began to be considered as a future candidate for party leader. Robens himself \"yearned to become Prime Minister\". However, he failed to impress during the Suez Crisis of 1956 because he had been briefed in confidence by the Conservative Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, on the night before the invasion; sworn to secrecy, he was unable to oppose the invasion effectively in the debate in the House of Commons. Furthermore, party leader Gaitskell felt him too left-wing. He was replaced as Shadow Foreign Secretary by Bevan, and felt that his political ambitions had been frustrated. Thus, when Harold Macmillan (Eden's successor as Prime Minister) offered Robens the chairmanship of the National Coal Board (NCB) in 1960, he accepted enthusiastically. Gaitskell died in January 1963. Geoffrey Tweedale, writing in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", has expressed the view that, had Robens persisted in politics, he, rather than Harold Wilson, would likely have become Prime Minister. Indeed, George Brown (the runner-up to Wilson in the election to succeed Gaitskell) stated in his autobiography that had Robens been in Parliament he himself would not have opposed him, and even if he had, Robens would have defeated him.\n\nRobens took up his appointment at the NCB in 1961 at a salary believed to be £10,000 a year (which was never increased throughout his ten years in office) and was created a life peer as Baron Robens of Woldingham, of Woldingham in the County of Surrey, on 28 June. Amongst those critical of this sudden elevation were his successor as MP for Blyth, Eddie Milne. Robens' leadership of the NCB was high-handed. He expected unflinching loyalty from colleagues and subordinates alike, and was confrontational with politicians. He enjoyed the trappings of power including a Daimler with the vehicle registration number \"NCB 1\" (although this had been a gift from an admirer which he had been reluctant to accept, and was only persuaded to do so to avoid hurting the feelings of the donor), an executive aeroplane (a six-seater De Havilland Dove which he and other Board members used to visit the far-flung coalfields) and a flat in Eaton Square (which was only a few hundred yards from the NCB Headquarters in Grosvenor Place and which had increased in value by the time it was sold after his retirement from the NCB). His behaviour earned him the nickname \"Old King Coal\", a pun on Old King Cole. However, he threw himself into the job with vigour and enthusiasm, visiting pits, arguing with miners at the coalface and developing a deep knowledge of the industry. In 1963 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject 'Coal - Its Place in the National Economy'.\n\nAs Chairman of the NCB, Robens oversaw substantial cuts in the mining industry, many of them reflecting market forces and government policies originated before he assumed the post. Although he lobbied to protect the industry, his reputation as a socialist necessarily suffered—when he took over as NCB chair there were 698 pits employing 583,000 miners, but by the time he left the post ten years later there were only 292 pits employing 283,000 miners. For a while Robens had a constructive working relationship with miners' leader Will Paynter, but he had a combative relationship with the Wilson Labour government. Industrial relations deteriorated during his tenure, and there was an unofficial strike in 1969 that lost £15 million and 2.5 million tonnes of coal as a result of a walkout by 140 of the 307 NCB collieries.\n\nRobens expressed concern at the poor health and safety record of the coal industry, and championed campaigns to reduce accidents and to counter chronic occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis. Although the number of fatal and serious accidents fell by over 60% during his tenure, there was also a fall in the workforce of over 50%, from 583,000 to 283,000.\n\nThe largest single blow to his reputation came from his reaction to the catastrophic 1966 industrial accident at Aberfan. On the morning of 21 October, a massive spoil heap from the nearby Merthyr Vale Colliery collapsed onto the village of Aberfan, burying 20 houses and the Pantglas Junior School in a landslide, thirty feet deep, of water-saturated slurry that killed 116 schoolchildren and 28 adults.\n\nDespite the enormity of the disaster, Robens felt that he had no alternative but to go ahead with his installation as the first Chancellor of the new University of Surrey (which involved hundreds of people) before going to Aberfan, and he did not arrive until the evening of the Saturday following the day of the disaster, a blunder that was compounded by the actions of NCB staff, who falsely informed the Minister of Power, Richard Marsh, that Robens was at Aberfan. It was always his policy to send the most senior mining engineer to the scene of a disaster to coordinate rescue operations. Speaking to the media on the Sunday after the disaster, Robens was concerned that the initial shock and sorrow might give way to anger, possibly directed towards the men who worked at the top of the spoil heaps. To avoid this, he said that those men could not have foreseen what happened. A TV interview during which he made that comment proved to be unacceptable for broadcasting, owing to the atmospheric conditions; instead, the interviewer broadcast a paraphrase of the interview that wrongly made it seem that Robens had claimed that no one in the NCB could have foreseen the disaster. This was later taken by the Aberfan disaster enquiry to imply that the Board was contesting liability, notwithstanding the 19th-century case of \"Rylands v Fletcher\" which meant that the Board had absolute liability for damage caused by a 'dangerous escape' of material. Conversely, in a later interview Robens claimed that the disaster had been caused by \"natural unknown springs\" beneath the tip; but evidence emerged that the existence of these springs was common knowledge.\n\nThe report of the Davies Tribunal which inquired into the disaster was highly critical of the NCB and Robens. He had proposed to appear at the outset of the enquiry to admit the NCB's full responsibility for the disaster, but the Chairman of the Tribunal advised him that this would not be necessary. In the event, when it was clear that his earlier comments to reporters had been misinterpreted at the Tribunal as a denial of responsibility, he offered to appear at the enquiry to set the matter straight. He conceded that the NCB was at fault, an admission which would have rendered much of the inquiry unnecessary had it been made at the outset, notwithstanding the advice of Lord Edmund Davies that his appearance was not necessary. After the report was published in August 1967, Robens wrote to Marsh, the Minister of Power, offering his resignation; this was rejected by him and by Prime Minister Wilson, although several cabinet members argued strongly that Robens ought to be removed.\n\nThere have been allegations that the resignation offer was \"bogus\" and Robens had been assured that it would not be accepted. According to Ronald Dearing, then a part-time member of the NCB, Richard Marsh was advised that Robens was \"taking the coal industry through a period of painful contraction without big strikes\" and the strong support for him within the coal industry and the union movement were crucial to the decision to retain him. When Robens advised a meeting of the full Board that he had offered his resignation, there was surprise and consternation; Cecil King, a part-time member of the Board, rose to his feet and told Robens that in doing so he had acted correctly.\n\nIn the wake of the disaster, Robens was asked that the NCB should fund the removal of the remaining tips from Aberfan. He was advised, however, that the cost of doing so would have obliged the NCB to exceed its borrowing limits, which had been set by the government. To incur that cost would, in effect, have broken the law. It was not that Robens refused to pay. He had acceded to a request from the bereaved mothers of Aberfan to meet them to hear their views, and he was received by them with courtesy. In the end, the cost was met partly by the Board and partly by the Government, with a contribution from the Aberfan Disaster Fund.\n\nThe Trustees of the Disaster Fund, which had been raised by public appeal, had been put under \"intolerable pressure\" to make a contribution of £150,000 (£2 million at 2016 prices) to cover the cost of removing the tips – an action that was \"unquestionably unlawful\" under charity law – and the Charity Commission took no action to protect the Fund from this dubious, indeed dishonest, misappropriation of funds.\n\nThere is no evidence that prosecution for corporate manslaughter was considered at the time. Robens was exonerated by the official history of the NCB but he remains condemned in other quarters.\n\nIn 1969, Robens was selected by Barbara Castle to chair a committee on workplace health and safety. This led to the 1972 Robens Report which controversially championed the idea of self-regulation by employers. The Report itself led to the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the creation of the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive.\n\nFollowing the Conservative victory in the 1970 general election, Robens found the new administration's distaste for nationalisation at odds with his own rather paternalistic views. He fell into conflict with Prime Minister Edward Heath and Minister of State for Industry Sir John Eden. Robens left the NCB in 1971 but always insisted that his tenure was a success.\n\nRobens had become a director of the Bank of England in 1966 and a member of the board of directors of Times Newspapers in 1967. He was Chairman of Vickers from 1971 to 1979, opposing the Labour plans for nationalisation that led to the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977. He was Chairman of Johnson Matthey from 1971 to 1983, and a director of Trust House Forte and several other companies. His lifestyle was increasingly at odds with his socialist beginnings and by 1979, he had become aligned with the Conservative Party.\n\nHe left public life in 1982, retiring with his wife to Laleham Abbey, once the home of The 7th Earl of Lucan. Robens suffered the first of two debilitating strokes in 1992 and ultimately died in 1999 aged 88.\n\nRobens's period at the National Coal Board was mentioned in the folk songs of the period. Ed Pickford, who was a miner in the Durham Coalfield, was highly critical of Robens: his song \"The Pound a Week Rise\" criticises the low wages paid to coal miners during Robens's reign, and his song \"One Miner's Life\" refers to the widespread pit closures. Jock Purdon, a miner who was made redundant on the closure of Harraton Colliery in Durham, wrote the song \"Farewell to Cotia\" about the migration of redundant miners across the country and particularly to Nottinghamshire, which he referred to as \"Robens's promised land\".\n\n\n"}

At the student exhibition at the Museum of Javanese Culture \"Sono Budoyo\" his wooden sculpture \"A Forgotten Blind\" was purchased by the president Soekarno. In the same year in Bandung, he participated in an exhibition timed to the Bandung Conference of Asia and Africa, where he exhibited his new wooden work “Unheard Cries”, which was praised by critics; the American art critic Claire Holt wrote: ...  How amazing the artist presented the suffering and the struggle of the spirit at this exhibition. Amrus is the most original young sculptor with such quality works that you rarely see in other Indonesian artists. - \n\nIn 1957, he held his first solo exhibition in Jakarta, the first exhibition under the open sky in Indonesia. He presented his wooden sculptures up to four meters high. In 1959, Batara Lubis , the cartoonist A. Sibarani and him represented Indonesia at the International Youth Week in Vienna, and on the way back they visited the Soviet Union and China. The following year he went to Jidda at the invitation of the mayor of the city to make a wooden panel with calligraphy. At the same time he performed Hajj. \n\nIn 1960, at a student exhibition in Jakarta, he exhibited paintings on canvas, and again they attracted Soekarno’s attention: he bought the canvas \"My friends\" (1959). In 1961, together with other students (Misbach Tamrin, Kuslan Budiman, Adrianus Gumelar, and others) he created the \"Bumi Tarung\" art workshop in Jakarta . At the same time he took part in the activities of the People's Cultural Association (Lekra), which was under the auspices of the Communist Party of Indonesia. \n\nAfter the events of September 30, 1965 he was arrested and held in jail without trial and investigation until 1973.\n\nAfter his release from prison he worked in his workshop at the Anchol Arts Bazaar . Here he mastered a new genre - pictures on the boards, which became very popular among collectors. \n\nBut he did not abandon his old passion for wooden sculpture - a series of sculptures \"Noah's Ark\" in 1998 at the exhibition in the Cultural Center of Jakarta was recognized as the best work of the exhibition and was acquired by the museum of the university \"Pelita Harapan\". As for the pictures on the boards, the most impressive series is \"China Town\", which he made under the influence of anti-Chinese pogroms in 1998 and exhibited in the prestigious Mon Monk Gallery (1999). Later, another solo exhibition was held in this gallery (2004) and the Canna gallery (2005). The most significant collection of his paintings and sculptures belongs to the Indonesian collector Etti Mustafa, who has been collecting his works since 1995.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25829181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25829181", "title": "Battery nomenclature", "text": "Battery nomenclature\n\nStandard battery nomenclature describes portable dry cell batteries that have physical dimensions and electrical characteristics interchangeable between manufacturers. The long history of disposable dry cells means that many different manufacturer-specific and national standards were used to designate sizes, long before international standards were reached. Technical standards for battery sizes and types are set by standards organizations such as International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Popular sizes are still referred to by old standard or manufacturer designations, and some non-systematic designations have been included in current international standards due to wide use.\n\nThe complete nomenclature for the battery will fully specify the size, chemistry, terminal arrangements and special characteristics of a battery. The same physically interchangeable cell size may have widely different characteristics; physical interchangeability is not the sole factor in substitution of batteries.\n\nNational standards for dry cell batteries have been developed by ANSI, JIS, British national standards, and others. Civilian, commercial, government and military standards all exist. Two of the most prevalent standards currently in use are the IEC 60086 series and the ANSI C18.1 series. Both standards give dimensions, standard performance characteristics, and safety information.\n\nModern standards contain both systematic names for cell types that give information on the composition and approximate size of the cells, as well as arbitrary numeric codes for cell size.\n\nThe International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) was established in France in 1906 and co-ordinates development of standards for a wide range of electrical products. The IEC maintains two committees, TC21 established in 1933 for rechargeable batteries, and TC35 established in 1948 for primary batteries, to develop standards. The current designation system was adopted in 1992. Battery types are designated with a letter/number sequence indicating number of cells, cell chemistry, cell shape, dimensions, and special characteristics. Certain cell designations from earlier revisions of the standard have been retained.\n\nThe first IEC standards for battery sizes were issued in 1957.\nSince 1992, International standard IEC 60086 defines an alphanumeric coding system for batteries.\nBritish standard 397 for primary batteries was withdrawn and replaced by the IEC standard in 1996.\n\nStandardization of batteries in the United States started in 1919, when the US National Bureau of Standards published recommended test procedures and standard dimensions of cells. American standards were revised several times during the following decades, as new sizes of cells were introduced and new chemistry developed, including chloride, alkaline, mercury and rechargeable types.\n\nThe first American Standards Association (predecessor to ANSI) standard C18 appeared in 1928. It listed cell sizes using a letter code, roughly in order of size from smallest (A) to larger types. The only numerical designation was the 6-inch tall \"No. 6\" cell. The 1934 edition of the C18 standard expanded the nomenclature system to include series and parallel arrays of cells. In 1954, mercury batteries were included in the standard. The 1959 edition identified types suitable for use with transistor radios. In 1967, NEMA took over responsibility for development from the National Bureau of Standards. The 12th edition of C18 began to be harmonized with the IEC standard. Rechargeable batteries were introduced in the C18 standard in 1984, and lithium types were standardized in 1991.\n\nIn 1999 the ANSI standards were extensively revised and separate safety standards provided. The current edition of the ANSI standards designates sizes with an arbitrary number, with a prefix letter to designate shape, and with a suffix letter or letters to identify different chemistry, terminals, or other features.\n\nThree different technical committees of IEC make standards on batteries: TC21(lead-acid), SC21(other secondary) and TC35(primary). Each group has published standards relating to the nomenclature of batteries - IEC 60095 for lead-acid starter batteries, IEC 61951-1 and 61951-2 for Ni-Cd and Ni-MH batteries, IEC 61960 for Li-ion, and IEC 60086-1 for primary batteries.\n\nExamples of the IEC nomenclature are batteries coded R20, 4R25X, 4LR25-2, 6F22, 6P222/162, CR17345 and LR2616J. The letters and numbers in the code indicate the number of cells, cell chemistry, shape, dimensions, the number of parallel paths in the assembled battery and any modifying letters deemed necessary. A multi-section battery (two or more voltages from the same package) will have a multi-section designation.\n\nPrior to October 1990, round cells were designated with a sequential numeric size code ranging from R06 through to R70, for example R20 is the size of a \"D\" cell or ANSI\"13\" size. After October 1990, round cells are systematically identified with a number derived from their diameter and height. Primary cells larger than 100 mm in diameter or height are designated with an oblique \"/\" between diameter and height.\n\nThe first letter identifies the chemical composition of the battery, which also implies a nominal voltage.\n\nIt is common to refer to the negative electrode first in IEC battery definitions.\n\"Italics\" indicate a chemical system unlikely to be found in consumer or general-purpose batteries, or withdrawn from the current standard.\n\nShape codes are:\n\nThe \"F\" and \"S\" shape codes are still in use but are not to be used for new battery definitions.\n\nCertain sizes, given by one or two digit numbers, represent standard size codes from previous editions of the standard. Sizes given as 4 or more digits indicate the diameter of the battery and the overall height.\n\nThe numbers in the code correlate with the battery dimensions. For batteries with dimensions of < 100 mm the (truncated) diameter in millimetres, followed by the height in tenths of a millimetre; for batteries with a single dimension ≥ 100 mm the diameter in millimetres, then a slash (/) followed by the height in millimetres.\n\nAs well as the recommended size code definitions there are also ten modifying suffix letters that can be added to the end of the specific size code. These run from A to L (omitting F and I) and depending on the largest dimension of the battery can either signify 0.0 – 0.9 mm maximum dimensions or 0.00 – 0.09 mm maximum dimensions with A being 0.0 or 0.00 and L being 0.9 or 0.09.\n\nFor flat cells the diameter code is given as the diameter of a circle circumscribed around the whole cell's area.\n\nStandardized size codes for round batteries which do not follow the current nomenclature but have been retained for ease of use are given by a one or two digit number following the R. These include but are not limited to:\n\nRound button batteries also carry two-digit size codes such as R44, see the button battery table for typical dimensions. Other round, flat, and square sizes have been standardized but are used mostly for components of multi-cell batteries.\n\nThe following is a partial list of IEC standard recommended diameter and height codes for round cells:\nAfter the package size code(s), additional letters may optionally appear. Terminal styles and variants of the same battery can be designated with the letters X or Y. Performance levels may also be designated with a C, P, S, CF, HH, or HB or other letter suffixes.\nAn appended letter \"W\" states that this battery complies with all the requirements of the IEC 60086-3 standard for watch batteries, such as dimensional tolerance, chemical leakage, and test methods.\n\nIEC nomenclature classifies batteries according to their general shape and overall physical appearance. These categories, however, are not identified in the IEC battery nomenclature.\n\n\nNickel-cadmium and Nickel-metal hydride batteries follow a similar rule as the system above; especially cylindrical cells designed to be dimensionally interchangeable with primary batteries use the same designation as the primary batteries, the codes for electrochemical systems as below.\nAll other cells use the following system.\n\nLithium-ion batteries have a different rule for naming, which applies both to batteries of multiple cells and single cell. They will be designated as:\n\nNAAAN/N/N-N\n\nwhere N denotes number of series connected cells and N denotes number of parallel connected cells (only when the number is greater than 1); these numbers only apply to batteries.\n\nA indicates the basis of negative electrode phase, where I is for lithium ion and L is for lithium metal or alloy.\n\nA indicates the basis of positive electrode phase, and could be C, N, M, V or T for cobalt, nickel, manganese, vanadium and titanium respectively.\n\nA is for the shape of the cell; either R for cylinder and P for prism.\n\nN is the maximum diameter (in case of cylindrical cells) or thickness (prismatic cells) in mm.\n\nN is only used for prismatic cells to denote the maximum width in mm.\n\nN is the maximum overall height in mm.\n\nE.g. ICR19/66, ICPt9/35/48, 2ICP20/34/70, 1ICP20/68/70-2\n\nEarly editions of the ANSI standard used a letter code to identify the dimensions of the cell. Since at the time there were only carbon-zinc cells, no suffix letters or other notation were required. The letter system was introduced in the 1924 edition of the standard, with letters A through J assigned approximately in order of increasing cell volume, for cells typically manufactured at that time. By 1934, the system had been revised and extended to 17 sizes ranging from NS at  inch diameter by  inch height, through size J at  inches diameter by  inches high, to the largest standard cell which retained its old designation of No. 6 and which was  inches in diameter and 6 inches high. \n\nThe current edition of the standard uses a numerical code to show the cell size. Common round cell sizes are:\n\nSince these IEC and ANSI battery standards have been harmonized, for example, an R20 cell will have the same dimensions as an ANSI 13 cell.\n\nFlat cells, used as components of multi-cell batteries, have an F prefix and a series of numbers to identify sizes.\nCoin cells were assigned size codes in the 5000 range.\n\nSecondary cells using systems H and K (nickel-metal hydride and nickel-iron sulfide) have a separate series of size codes, but the cells are dimensionally interchangeable with primary cells.\n\nThe electrochemical system and performance information is given in suffix letters.\n\n"}
{"id": "292381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=292381", "title": "Brazil nut", "text": "Brazil nut\n\nThe Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is a South American tree in the family Lecythidaceae, and also the name of the tree's commercially harvested edible seeds.\n\nThe Brazil nut family is in the order Ericales, as are other well-known plants such as blueberries, cranberries, sapote, gutta-percha, tea, phlox and persimmons.\n\nThe Brazil nut tree is the only species in the monotypic genus \"Bertholletia\". It is native to the Guianas, Venezuela, Brazil, eastern Colombia, eastern Peru, and eastern Bolivia. It occurs as scattered trees in large forests on the banks of the Amazon River, Rio Negro, Tapajós, and the Orinoco. The genus is named after the French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet.\n\nThe Brazil nut is a large tree, reaching tall and with a trunk in diameter, making it among the largest of trees in the Amazon rainforests. It may live for 500 years or more, and according to some authorities often reaches an age of 1,000 years. The stem is straight and commonly without branches for well over half the tree's height, with a large emergent crown of long branches above the surrounding canopy of other trees.\n\nThe bark is grayish and smooth. The leaves are dry-season deciduous, alternate, simple, entire or crenate, oblong, long and broad. The flowers are small, greenish-white, in panicles long; each flower has a two-parted, deciduous calyx, six unequal cream-colored petals, and numerous stamens united into a broad, hood-shaped mass.\n\nIn Brazil, it is illegal to cut down a Brazil nut tree. As a result, they can be found outside production areas, in the backyards of homes and near roads and streets. The fruits are very heavy and rigid; when the fruits fall, they pose a serious threat to vehicles and people passing under the tree. Brazil nut fruits sink in fresh water, which can cause clogging of waterways in riparian areas.\n\nBrazil nut trees produce fruit almost exclusively in pristine forests, as disturbed forests lack the large-bodied bees of the genera \"Bombus\", \"Centris\", \"Epicharis\", \"Eulaema\", and \"Xylocopa\" which are the only ones capable of pollinating the tree's flowers, with different bee genera being the primary pollinators in different areas, and different times of year. Brazil nuts have been harvested from plantations, but production is low and is currently not economically viable.\n\nThe fruit takes 14 months to mature after pollination of the flowers. The fruit itself is a large capsule in diameter, resembling a coconut endocarp in size and weighing up to . It has a hard, woody shell thick, which contains eight to 24 triangular seeds long (the \"Brazil nuts\") packed like the segments of an orange.\n\nThe capsule contains a small hole at one end, which enables large rodents like the agouti to gnaw it open. They then eat some of the seeds inside while burying others for later use; some of these are able to germinate into new Brazil nut trees. Most of the seeds are \"planted\" by the agoutis in shady places, and the young saplings may have to wait years, in a state of dormancy, for a tree to fall and sunlight to reach it, when it starts growing again. Capuchin monkeys have been reported to open Brazil nuts using a stone as an anvil.\n\nDespite their name, the most significant exporter of Brazil nuts is not Brazil but Bolivia, where they are called or . In Brazil, these nuts are called (literally \"chestnuts from Pará\"), but Acreans call them instead. Indigenous names include \"juvia\" in the Orinoco area. In Cuba, the nut is alternatively called , literally \"St. James coconut\".\n\nIn the past in North America, Brazil nuts were sometimes known by the epithet \"nigger toes\", a term that became unacceptable as a racial slur.\n\nIn 2014, global production of Brazil nuts (in shell) was 95,000 tonnes, remaining a consistent annual total since 2009. The largest producers were Bolivia (47% of world total) and Brazil (40%), and the United States was the largest importer, with 9% of the world production volume.\n\nBrazil nuts for international trade can come from wild collection rather than from plantations. This has been advanced as a model for generating income from a tropical forest without destroying it. The nuts are gathered by migrant workers known as \"castanheiros\".\n\nAnalysis of tree ages in areas that are harvested show that moderate and intense gathering takes so many seeds that not enough are left to replace older trees as they die. Sites with light gathering activities had many young trees, while sites with intense gathering practices had hardly any young trees.\n\nStatistical tests were done to determine what environmental factors could be contributing to the lack of younger trees. The most consistent effect was found to be the level of gathering activity at a particular site. A computer model predicting the size of trees where people picked all the nuts matched the tree size data gathered from physical sites that had heavy harvesting.\n\nBrazil nuts are 14% protein, 12% carbohydrate, and 66% fat by weight; 85% of their calories come from fat, and a 100 gram amount provides 656 total calories. The fat components are 23% saturated, 38% monounsaturated, and 32% polyunsaturated. Due to their high polyunsaturated fat content, primarily omega-6 fatty acids, shelled Brazil nuts may quickly become rancid.\n\nNutritionally, Brazil nuts are an excellent source (> 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of dietary fiber (30% DV) and various vitamins and dietary minerals. A 100 gram amount (75% of one cup) of Brazil nuts contains rich content of thiamin (54% DV), vitamin E (38% DV), magnesium (106% DV), phosphorus (104% DV), manganese (57% DV) and zinc (43% DV) (right table). Brazil nuts are perhaps the richest dietary source of selenium, with a one-ounce (28 g) serving of 6 nuts supplying 774% DV. This is 10 times the adult U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance, more even than the Tolerable Upper Intake Level, although the amount of selenium within batches of nuts varies greatly.\n\nThe European Union has imposed strict regulations on the import from Brazil of Brazil nuts in their shells, as the shells have been found to contain high levels of aflatoxins, which can lead to liver cancer.\n\nBrazil nuts contain small amounts of radium, a radioactive element, in about 1–7 nCi/kg or 40–260 Bq/kg, about 1000 times higher than in several other common foods. According to Oak Ridge Associated Universities, this is not because of elevated levels of radium in the soil, but due to \"the very extensive root system of the tree.\"\n\nBrazil nuts are a common ingredient in mixed nuts. Because of their large size, they tend to rise to the top upon forced vibrations likely encountered during transport, an example of granular convection, which for this reason is often called the \"Brazil nut effect.\"\n\nBrazil nut oil contains 75% unsaturated fatty acids composed mainly of oleic and linolenic acids, as well as the phytosterol, beta-sitosterol, and fat-soluble vitamin E.\n\nThe following table presents the composition of fatty acids in Brazil nut oil:\n\nAs well as its food use, Brazil nut oil is also used as a lubricant in clocks, for making artists' paints, and in the cosmetics industry. Engravings in Brazil nut shells were supposedly used as decorative jewelry by the indigenous tribes in Bolivia, although no examples still exist. Because of its hardness, the Brazil nut's shell is often pulverized and used as an abrasive to polish materials such as metals and even ceramics (in the same way jeweler's rouge is used).\n\nThe lumber from Brazil nut trees (not to be confused with Brazilwood) is of excellent quality, but logging the trees is prohibited by law in all three producing countries (Brazil, Bolivia and Peru).

{"id": "2084276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084276", "title": "Cadmium telluride", "text": "Cadmium telluride\n\nCadmium telluride (CdTe) is a stable crystalline compound formed from cadmium and tellurium. It is mainly used as the semiconducting material in cadmium telluride photovoltaics and an infrared optical window. It is usually sandwiched with cadmium sulfide to form a p-n junction solar PV cell. Typically, CdTe PV cells use a n-i-p structure.\n\nCdTe is used to make thin film solar cells, accounting for about 8% of all solar cells installed in 2011. They are among the lowest-cost types of solar cell, although a comparison of total installed cost depends on installation size and many other factors, and has changed rapidly from year to year. The CdTe solar cell market is dominated by First Solar. In 2011, around 2 GW of CdTe solar cells were produced; For more details and discussion see cadmium telluride photovoltaics.\n\nCdTe can be alloyed with mercury to make a versatile infrared detector material (HgCdTe). CdTe alloyed with a small amount of zinc makes an excellent solid-state X-ray and gamma ray detector (CdZnTe).\n\nCdTe is used as an infrared optical material for optical windows and lenses and is proven to provide a good performance across a wide range of temperatures. An early form of CdTe for IR use was marketed under the trademarked name of \"Irtran-6\" but this is obsolete.\n\nCdTe is also applied for electro-optic modulators. It has the greatest electro-optic coefficient of the linear electro-optic effect among II-VI compound crystals (r=r=r=6.8×10 m/V).\n\nCdTe doped with chlorine is used as a radiation detector for x-rays, gamma rays, beta particles and alpha particles. CdTe can operate at room temperature allowing the construction of compact detectors for a wide variety of applications in nuclear spectroscopy. The properties that make CdTe superior for the realization of high performance gamma- and x-ray detectors are high atomic number, large bandgap and high electron mobility ~1100 cm/V·s, which result in high intrinsic μτ (mobility-lifetime) product and therefore high degree of charge collection and excellent spectral resolution. Due to the poor charge transport properties of holes, ~100 cm/V·s, single-carrier-sensing detector geometries are used to produce high resolution spectroscopy; these include coplanar grids, frish-collar detectors and small pixel detectors.\n\n\nBulk CdTe is transparent in the infrared, from close to its band gap energy (1.5 eV at 300 K, which corresponds to infrared wavelength of about 830 nm) out to wavelengths greater than 20 µm; correspondingly, CdTe is fluorescent at 790 nm. As the size of CdTe crystals are reduced to a few nanometers or less, thus making them CdTe quantum dots, the fluorescence peak shifts through the visible range into the ultraviolet.\n\nCdTe is insoluble in water. CdTe has a high melting point of 1041 °C with evaporation starting at 1050 °C. CdTe has a vapor pressure of zero at ambient temperatures. CdTe is more stable than its parent compounds cadmium and tellurium and most other Cd compounds, due to its high melting point and insolubility.\n\nCadmium telluride is commercially available as a powder, or as crystals. It can be made into nanocrystals.\n\nThe compound CdTe has different qualities than the two elements, cadmium and tellurium, taken separately. Toxicity studies show that CdTe is less toxic than elemental cadmium. CdTe has low acute inhalation, oral, and aquatic toxicity, and is negative in the Ames mutagenicity test. Based on notification of these results to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), CdTe is no longer classified as harmful if ingested nor harmful in contact with skin, and the toxicity classification to aquatic life has been reduced. Once properly and securely captured and encapsulated, CdTe used in manufacturing processes may be rendered harmless. Current CdTe modules pass the U.S. EPA’s Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test, designed to assess the potential for long-term leaching of products disposed in landfills.\n\nA document hosted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health dated 2003 discloses that:\n\nBrookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) are\nnominating Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) for inclusion in the National Toxicology Program (NTP). This nomination is strongly supported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and First Solar Inc. The material has the potential for widespread applications in photovoltaic energy generation that will involve extensive human interfaces. Hence, we consider that a definitive toxicological study of the effects of long-term exposure to CdTe is a necessity.\nResearchers from the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory have found that large-scale use of CdTe PV modules does not present any risks to health and the environment, and recycling the modules at the end of their useful life completely resolves any environmental concerns. During their operation, these modules do not produce any pollutants, and, furthermore, by displacing fossil fuels, they offer great environmental benefits. CdTe PV modules that use cadmium as a raw material appear to be more environmentally friendly than all other current uses of Cd. CdTe PV provides a sustainable solution to a potential oversupply of cadmium in the near future. Cadmium is generated as a waste by-product of zinc refining and is generated in substantial amounts regardless of its use in PV, due to the demand for steel products.\n\nAt the present time, the price of the raw materials cadmium and tellurium are a negligible proportion of the cost of CdTe solar cells and other CdTe devices. However, tellurium is a relatively rare element (1–5 parts per billion in the Earth's crust; see Abundances of the elements (data page)). Through improved material efficiency and increased PV recycling systems, the CdTe PV industry has the potential to fully rely on tellurium from recycled end-of-life modules by 2038. See Cadmium telluride photovoltaics for more information. Another study shows that CdTe PV recycling will add a significant secondary resource of Te which, in conjunction with improved material utilization, will enable a cumulative capacity of about 2 TW by 2050 and 10 TW by the end of the century.\n\n"}

DEAP utilizes background discrimination based on the characteristic scintillation pulse-shape in argon. A first-generation detector (DEAP-1) with a 7 kg target mass operated at Queen's University to test the available pulse-shape discrimination at low recoil energies in liquid argon, and was moved to SNOLAB in October 2007 and ran into 2011. Discrimination of beta and gamma events from nuclear recoils in the energy region of interest (near 20 keV of electron energy) is required to be better than 1 in 10 to sufficiently suppress backgrounds in the DEAP-1 detector.\n\nDEAP-3600 with 3600 kg of active mass is planned for operation beginning in mid 2015, with sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-sections as low as 10 cm² at 100 GeV.\n\nA later 50 ton-scale detector (DEAP-50T) is planned.\n\nElastic scattering of a WIMP in argon is expected to cause a nuclear recoil.\nIn order to uncover the faint signature of an interacting dark matter particle, the detector is sensitive to low energy interactions, and as such, the signal from the WIMP interaction is hidden within a large collection of events. These events are known as background events. The WIMP signal must be uniquely filtered from these events.\nIn DEAP, as the light output is characteristic to the type of event, be it either a nuclear recoil event or a beta or gamma event, the interaction of each event can be uniquely determined. This is done by finding the ratio of prompt light (<100ns) to late light (<15us) in any given pulse. This ratio is known as Fprompt. Nuclear recoil events have a high Fprompt (~3.0) while beta/gamma events have a low Fprompt (~0.3). Since the interaction (elastic scattering) of WIMPs is expected to cause a nuclear recoil event, low Fprompt events such as gamma interactions can be considered as noise and cut from the data.\n\n\"The largest potential background in DEAP-1 is from the beta decay of Argon-39 which has an activity of approximately 1 Bq/kg in natural argon.\"\n\nThe first stage of the DEAP project, DEAP-1, was designed in order to characterize several properties of liquid argon, demonstrate the pulse-shape discrimination of liquid argon and refine engineering. It was too small to perform a meaningful dark matter search.\nDEAP-1 utilizes 7 kg of liquid argon as a target for WIMP interactions. Two photomultiplier tubes are used to detect the scintillation light produced by a particle interacting with the argon. As the scintillation light produced is of short wavelength (128 nm) a wavelength shifting film is used to broaden the wavelength so that it falls within the visible spectrum (440 nm) enabling it to pass through ordinary windows without any losses and be detected by the PMTs.\n\nDEAP-1 demonstrated good pulse-shape discrimination of backgrounds on the surface and began operation in SNOLAB. The deep underground location reduces unwanted cosmogenic signals (\"background\"). It ran from 2007 to 2011 (including two changes in the setup). DEAP-1 characterized the background, determining design improvements needed in DEAP-3600.\n\nThe second generation DEAP-3600 detector uses 3600 kg of liquid argon, of which 1000 kg is the fiducial volume, and the rest is for self-shielding and background veto. This is contained in a spherical acrylic tank surrounded by 255 photomultiplier tubes and many layers of radiation shielding. Projected sensitivity to WIMP cross-section is 10 cm at 100 GeV after three years of data taking.\n\nA large, international collaboration from Canadian and UK universities and laboratories are jointly working toward a large tonne-scale detector. The collaboration benefits largely from the experience many of the members and institutions gained on the SNO project, which detects neutrinos, another weakly interacting particle.\n\nCollaborators are from Queen's University, Carleton University, SNOLAB, Laurentian University, TRIUMF, University of Alberta, Royal Holloway University of London, University of Sussex, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, National Autonomous University of Mexico and most recently Canadian Nuclear Laboratories Ltd..\n\n\"PMT system has been operational since the end of 2014 and is being calibrated with light sources. ... Inner wavelength shifter was deposited on the acrylic vessel in June 2015\".\n\nThe DEAP-3600 detector started taking commissioning data in February 2015 with nitrogen gas purge in the detector. The detector fill was completed and data-taking was started on August 5, 2016.\n\nShortly after the initial fill of the detector with liquid argon, a butyl O-ring seal failed on 17 Aug 2016 and contaminated the argon with 100 ppm of N. The detector was then vented and re-filled, but this time to a level of 3300 kg to avoid a re-occurrence of the seal failure, with the second fill completed in Nov 2016. The first results with an exposure of 4.44 live days from the initial fill were published on 1 Aug 2017, giving a cross-section limit of 1.2×10 cm for a 100 GeV/c WIMP mass.\n\nDEAP-50T is the planned expansion with 50 tons of depleted argon, with a sensitivity of 10 cm.\n\n"}

They are also commonly termed n-6 DPA and n-3 DPA, respectively; these designations describes the position of the double bond being 6 or 3 carbons closest to the (omega) carbon at the methyl end of the molecule and is based on the biologically important difference that n-6 and n-3 PUFA are separate PUFA classes, i.e. the omega-6 fatty acids and omega-3 fatty acids, respectively.

It is a monospecific genus, containing only the species Ca. \"Epixenosoma ejectans.\n\nEpixenosomes possess two distinct developmental phases linked to the host cell cycle. Stage I epixenosomes are spherical, 0.5 μm in diameter and are surrounded by two membranes. They divide by direct binary fission. Stage II epixenosomes are egg-shaped (2.2 μm in length and 1 μm in width) and show complex organization with different cytoplasmic compartments, more complicated than the majority of prokaryotic organisms. They contain an extrusive apparatus within a proteinaceous matrix, although apparently not membrane-bound, which differs from the remaining cytoplasm. A functional cell compartmentalization has also been evidenced.\n\nTheir phylogenetic position was originally unclear, because they appeared to have both prokaryote-like traits, such as binary fission, and eukaryote-like traits, such as intracellular membranes. However, molecular phylogenetics showed that they are actually bacteria from the phylum Verrucomicrobia.\n\nEpixenosomes live on the dorsal surface of their hosts, marine ciliates in the genus \"Euplotidium\". The name \"epixenosomes\" comes from the ancient Greek , meaning \"external alien body\", referring to their extracellular position on the host. The extrusive apparatus ejects its contents when triggered; this process helps to defend the ciliate host against predators. Although \"Euplotidium\" can grow and reproduce without epixenosomes, those with epixenosomes have much higher survival when exposed to predators such as the ciliate \"Litonotus\".\n\nExternal signals of unknown origin are detected by the membrane receptors located at the top of the organism. The consequent activation of the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system triggers the ejection of the extrusive apparatus, with the formation of a hollow tube, about 40 μm long, terminating in a head mainly consisting of the apical portion of the epixenosome (the region containing DNA).\n\nThe extrusive apparatus is surrounded by a basket of tubules. Experiments with antitubulin drugs and immunocytochemical analyses at the optical and electron microscopical level suggested that these tubules consist of tubulin, which is a eukaryotic protein. Although some free-living Verrucomicrobia are reported to have tubulin genes, they have not been found to have tubular structures like those of epixenosomes.\n\n"}

Optional equipment included off-road under-body skid-plate protection, \"Traction-Lok\" rear limited-slip differential, and a heavy-duty trailer towing package.\n\nOptional was an electronically controlled pneumatic air suspension system that would raise and lower the vehicle depending on road and load conditions. The system also included a kneel-down mode for easier ingress and egress, as well as loading cargo,\n\nStandard was the 4.6 liter Triton V8 with the 5.4 liter version optional. The first generation Expedition was rated as a Low Emission Vehicle (LEV). The latter engine combined with the heavy-duty trailer towing package and appropriate axle ratio can achieve a towing capacity of 8,100 lbs (3,674 kg).\n\nA two air bag supplementary restraint system (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard. The air bags would adjust deployment force depending on crash severity. Features included SecuriLock with smart key and engine immobilizer, security approach lamps, four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS), side-intrusion door beams, post-crash fuel pump shut-off and three-point safety belts for all rows of seating with tension and locking retractors.\n\nAn optional four air bag SRS with 4-way occupant protection was available for the 2000–2002 model years. This included seat-mounted side torso side air bags.\n\nThe 2001 model introduced a BeltMinder system to detect when the driver did not have their safety belt secured.\n\nNo major cosmetic or mechanical changes. A new exterior color was added: Wedgewood Blue. Limited availability for 4.6 Windsor versus Romeo engine. This limited run was available only for Ultimate Tow Package\n\nThe 1999 model year received a facelift similar to that of the 1999 model year Ford F-150. Included in the update was a new front grille which now dropped lower in the center, grille work, as well as a new front bumper that incorporated the fog lamps into the lower valance and larger center air intake. Both the 4.6 liter and 5.4 liter V8 engines received updates including more power and torque. The Two High mode for automatic full-time ControlTrac four-wheel drive equipped models was dropped leaving only Auto, Four High (lock) and Four Low (lock) modes. The dashboard also received an updated radio and air conditioning controls and revised Gauge Cluster and a Digital Odometer for the first time.\nAvailable features on 2000 models included a hidden radio antenna (integrated into the rear quarter panel window glass), Gentex auto dimming electrochromatic rearview mirrors, lane departure indicators on side view mirrors (before on the glass) and ultrasonic rear park assist /backup sensors. The lower front bumper valance and illuminated running boards were changed over to Arizona beige to complement the standard Arizona beige exterior body trim on Eddie Bauer models. \"Estate Green Clearcoat Metallic\" replaces \"Spruce Green Clearcoat Metallic\", and \"Arizona Beige Metallic\" replaces \"Harvest Gold Clearcoat Metallic\" in the color palette.\n\nNew trim packages included the \"XLT\" model. XLT versions could be optioned with the \"XLT No Boundaries\" package that included monochromatic black paint work with chrome grille and special alloy wheels. Eddie Bauer versions could be optioned with the \"Eddie Bauer Premier\" package that included either monochromatic Arizona beige or solid black paint work with painted alloy wheels and upgraded leather seating.\n\nNo major cosmetic or mechanical changes. Last year model for the UN93. This was also the last model year for XLT No Boundaries and Eddie Bauer Premier trims.\nThe redesigned second-generation Expedition was developed under the U222 program code name from 1996 to 2002, under Ford chief vehicle engineer Steve von Foerster and chief program engineer John Krafcik from 1998 to 2002. Design work began in 1997, with a proposal by Tyler Blake being chosen by management and frozen for production in 1999. UN93-body mules were spotted testing in 2000, with full prototypes running from late 2000. The new Expedition was unveiled at the 2002 North American International Auto Show, in January. It was launched in May 2002 for the 2003 model year and featured a new four-wheel independent long-travel suspension system, becoming the first full-size sport utility vehicle to use a fully independent suspension.\n\nThe new independent rear suspension (IRS) was perceived as being controversial by some at the time of its introduction. A misconception was that the Expedition's towing and off-road capabilities would be reduced, in comparison to the previous generation's rear live axle. Nevertheless, underbody obstacle clearance improved by half an inch, and up to two inches under the axle differentials. The new suspension reduces rear unsprung mass by 110 pounds, and allows for a full 9.4 inches of suspension travel (how much the wheels can travel up or down) improving its ability to traverse uneven terrain for improved control and ride quality. The four-wheel independent long-travel suspension itself is a purpose-built version of race suspensions found on off-road desert race vehicles.\n\nTowing capacity increased by 800 lbs (363 kg) for a high towing capacity of 8,900 lbs (4,037 kg) when properly equipped with the appropriate axle ratio and heavy-duty trailer towing package. Payload capacity was increased up to 1,614 lbs (732 kg). Expedition also gained a hydroformed fully boxed frame providing a 70 percent improvement in torsional stiffness.\n\nAlong with the high towing capability came all-new steering, braking and electronic systems to help the Expedition better control and maneuver long heavy trailers. Adaptive variable assist power rack-and-pinion steering was introduced along with the largest brake rotors in the segment at that time (13.5 inches up front, 13 inches in back) with brake calipers 100 percent stiffer than the previous generation Expedition. The four-speed 4R70W automatic transmission received all-new control software to allow the transmission to automatically adjust to the demands of towing, using new computer logic that recognizes changes in load and road conditions.\n\nThe automatic full-time ControlTrac four-wheel drive system remained available, with an uprated two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4416 transfer case. The new transfer case featured an updated intelligent locking center multi-disc differential with front-to-rear \"torque biasing\" capability in Auto mode. A new dedicated microprocessor with new control software was added allowing the system to detect different terrain and surface conditions to predict traction loss before it happens. Two High mode was also reintroduced. Four-wheel electronic traction control was now available as an option, and simulated \"front\" and \"rear\" differential locks.\n\nThe V8 engines offered on the previous generation were carried over, but not without major changes and improvements. Both the 4.6 and 5.4-liter Triton V8 engines received further refinements in design and overall efficiency. Expedition qualified as an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) and was certified under the Environmental Protection Agency Tier 2 regulations one year earlier than required. The 4.6-liter engine received an all-new redesigned cast aluminium engine block optimized for weight reduction and NVH improvements. The 5.4-liter engine received an all-new redesigned cast-iron engine block with computer designed ribbing and bracing, along with thicker side skirts and reinforcement at the oil pan flange. The new engine block helped reduce engine vibration and unwanted noise while providing refined performance.\n\nBoth engines featured piston skirts coated with a teflon-based friction-reducing material, and fitted with low-tension, low oil consumption rings. In addition, a new fail-safe cooling mode provided protection even in the case of a catastrophic coolant loss (such as a punctured radiator). In the event of coolant loss, the engine control unit shuts off fuel to alternate cylinders to reduce the risk of engine damage from overheating. The valves continue to operate, in order to pump cooling air through the cylinders. The cooling system was designed to maintain an ideal engine temperature even when subjected to a prolonged 15 percent gradient in 46 °C (115 °F) weather. A returnless fuel supply system helped to reduce evaporative emissions by providing consistent pressure to the fuel injectors through a high-pressure pump.\n\nNew active hydraulic engine mounts were introduced to prevent the powertrain from inducing vibrations into the chassis. By optimizing these engine mounts, the engine block can act as a mass damper, absorbing chassis resonance, improving ride comfort.\n\nExpedition's passenger cabin was better sealed than before, in an effort to eliminate intrusive outside noise from reaching the occupants. Wind, powertrain, road and vehicle body noise was reduced by improving interior acoustics through new damping materials, a total of 10 shear-style isolating body mounts, heavier sealing of body and panels, redesigned rubber door seals, and extensive use of interior structural acoustic foam in the upper B-pillars, upper and lower D-pillars and floor pan. Road noise was reduced by 2 decibels, body air leakage reduced by 56 percent, chances for sealant noise disturbances reduced from 15 percent to less than 0.5 percent and wind noise measured at was reduced from 35 sones to a world class level of 29 sones.\n\nThe Expedition also received a thorough exterior and interior cosmetic redesign. Expedition featured an all-new front fascia, grille work, headlamps, body trim, rear fascia, tail lamps and liftgate. Interior fit and finish were improved with an all-new interior featuring new dash, door panels, genuine aluminium trim, and plush carpeting. Premium perforated leather seating surfaces were standard on Expedition \"Eddie Bauer\" (optional on Expedition \"XLT\"). Expedition \"FX4\" models featured all of Expedition's optional off-road equipment as standard equipment. Expedition's drag coefficient was 0.41 Cd.\n\nThree-row seating was standard with all-new manual fold-flat stow away third row seats. No longer did owners have to remove the third rows seats for more storage. The third row could simply \"disappear\" into the floor. Power assisted PowerFold fold-flat third row seating was available as an optional extra. Available features included in-dash CD-ROM based navigation system, DVD based rear entertainment system, ultrasonic rear park assist/back up sensors, power moon roof, power adjustable accelerator and brake pedals (introduced on the first generation Expedition), Gentex auto dimming electrochromatic rear view mirror, lane departure indicators on side-view mirrors, second-row captain's chair luxury seating, premium audiophile sound system with in-dash six-disc CD changer and rear subwoofer and four-wheel independent pneumatic air-ride suspension system.\n\nLike the generation before, a 2 air bag supplementary restraint system (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard on Expedition. The dual front SRS air bags now included the Personal Safety System (PSS). PSS would tailor air bag deployment for driver and first passenger and included occupant classification, seat position, crash severity, safety belt pretensioner, load-limiting retractor and safety belt buckle usage sensors.\n\nA new optional 4 air bag supplementary restraint system (SRS) with 6-way occupant protection was also available. This new air bag system included \"SafetyCanopy\" dual side curtain air bags for head, upper torso and rollover protection. SafetyCanopy would deploy along the A, B and C-pillars down to the vehicle's beltline. SafetyCanopy could remain inflated after deployment for extended protection and replaced the dual front side airbags featured on the first-generation Expedition.\n\nOther features included side-intrusion door beams, security approach lamps, SecuriLock with smart key and engine immobilizer, BeltMinder, three-point safety belts for all rows of seating, post-crash fuel pump shut-off, tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) and four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) with electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) and emergency brake assist (EBA). \"AdvanceTrac\" electronic stability control with traction control system was introduced as an optional extra. The electronic traction and stability mitigation system would expand to include \"roll stability control\" (RSC) for the 2005 model year.\n\nBefore the 2003 model year ended, Ford updated the running boards on Expeditions equipped with the Eddie Bauer trim. Earlier in the model year, Eddie Bauer models had received standard black running boards. Toward the end of the model year, Arizona beige running boards were re-introduced to complement the Arizona beige body work which came standard on Eddie Bauer. Body colored running boards had previously been offered on the first-generation Expedition from 2000 to 2002.\n\nNo major cosmetic or mechanical changes. The Expedition \"Eddie Bauer Premier\" model is reintroduced after being absent from the 2003 model trim line-up. Monochromatic paint work with blacked-out headlamps and special alloy wheels were standard on Eddie Bauer Premier versions. A new Expedition \"XLT Sport\" model is added with Dark Shadow grey exterior body trim. The \"FX4\" trim level was renamed \"NBX\".\n\nExpedition received new roof rails which replaced the traditional sliding cross-bar roof racks. A new high end \"Limited\" trim level replaced the Eddie Bauer Premier model (though the regular Eddie Bauer was still available) and featured chrome accented roof rails, chrome-clad aluminium wheels, PowerFold power assisted stowable side view mirrors and chrome tipped exhaust. An upper high end \"King Ranch\" trim level with Castano leather seating was also introduced. The base 4.6 liter Triton V8 engine was dropped for the 2005 model year as the 5.4-liter Triton V8 was made standard on all Expeditions and updated with 24-valve technology and variable valve timing. Along with the 2005 model V8 engine update, the Expedition also received a significantly updated version of the four-speed 4R70W automatic transmission.\n\nThe new four-speed automatic transmission, now called 4R75E, featured fully electronic Smart Shift technology. A turbine speed sensor improved transmission control and provided the basis for the fully electronic shift scheduling. The transmission's microprocessor speeds were improved for better responsiveness and precision of the control system. The transmission was continuously learning, and would calculate the torque in the next gear and schedule shift points based on the Expedition's projected performance in the next gear. For 2005 model Expeditions the 4R75E transmission is designated by the letter \"B\" on the manufacturers safety compliance certification label, located in the driver's-side doorjamb. For 2006 model Expeditions, the 4R75E transmission is designated by the letter \"Q\".\n\nNo major cosmetic or mechanical changes. Last year model for the U222. The Gentex auto dimming rear view mirrors were updated. Two new exterior colors were added later on within the model year. They were Pewter metallic and Dark Copper metallic. Medium Flint grey interior was also added to Limited models later on within the model year. Chrome tipped exhaust was made standard on King Ranch models. 2006 would be the last year model for the NBX trim. The ultrasonic rear park assist and SafetyCanopy side curtain airbags were offered as standalone options. Adjustable headrests were also added to the front seats to replace the one piece units.\n\nOn April 12, 2006, three second-generation full-size Ford Expedition \"Eddie Bauer\" vehicles completed a 32-day overland expedition. This was a trip across North Asia and the Arctic Tundra. Six team members consisted of leaders, Alexey Mikhailov and Alexander Borodin, technical director, Andrey Rodionov, and professional off-road drivers,: Sergey Goryachev, Victor Parshikov, and Alexey Simakin. The route took them on permafrost and crossed the Arctic Circle twice. Visited landmarks included where American aviator Carl Ben Eielson was lost, and the birthplace of Russian explorer Semyon Dezhnev. The northernmost point on the route was latitude 69°42′ North (Pevek). The easternmost point visited was longitude 169°40′ West (Cape Dezhnev). Temperatures reached -36 °C (-32 °F) and the team encountered whiteouts and a polar cyclone. An estimated 200 kg (440 lbs) of snow was removed from each of the vehicles on the following day.\n\nThe vehicles were modified with front end guards along with front and rear utility bumpers, winches, safari roof racks, high-powered off-road lights and extra underbody plating for the engines. Two of the vehicles towed a dual axle utility trailer. Two were equipped also with caterpillar track systems supplied by Mattracks. The rubber track systems were only used when off-road conditions became too demanding for conventional tires. The rear stabilizer bar failed on both vehicles fitted with the Mattracks system. The vehicles were also equipped with gas stoves (to prepare food) and high-capacity auxiliary fuel tanks (mounted in the rear cargo bay) and sometimes run on poor-quality gasoline.\n\nThe 2007 introduced the third generation of the Expedition developed under the U324 program code name which was an updated version of the second generation Expedition. Most of the improvements were mechanical in nature, and included a sheet metal refresh and redesigned interior with upgraded materials A new long wheelbase \"Expedition EL\" in (U.S. only) and called the \"Expedition Max\" (in Canada and Mexico only) as a replacement for the discontinued Ford Excursion.\n\nHigh-strength hydroformed fully boxed Ford T platform (chassis) was a modified version of the half-ton Ford P2 platform from the Ford F-150. The new T1 platform replaced the old U platform, and provides 10 percent more torsional rigidity than the U platform. T1 incorporates a four-wheel independent long-travel suspension system (first introduced on the second generation) with redesigned suspension geometry and an all-new five-link rear suspension with new rear lower control-arms. As with previous model years, the suspension system could be had with adaptive pneumatic air-ride springs.\n\nFord's new 6-speed 6R75 intelligent automatic transmission with dual overdrive gears was introduced. The transmission featured push-button overdrive lock-out, electronic shift scheduling, adaptive shift algorithms and a mechatronic transmission control module (TCM) that would save adaptive shift data in keep alive memory (KAM). This safeguarded against complete data loss in case of a power failure (such as disconnecting the battery). In the event of a power failure, the mechatronic unit would simply read the last saved data entry from the system's memory, thus, the transmission did not have to completely relearn the owner's driving style.\n\nAdditionally, the Expedition is powered by the same 5.4 liter Triton V-8 internal combustion engine, rated at and 365 lbf·ft (495 N·m) of torque from the previous generation. When properly equipped with the heavy-duty trailer towing package the SUV can tow up to 9,200 lbs (4,130 kg). Expedition is classed under the Tier 2, Bin 5 / ULEV 2 Ultra Low Emission Vehicle environmental classification.\n\nOff-road geometry figures for approach, departure and ramp breakover angles are 22°, 21° and 18° respectively. Minimum running (lowest point) ground clearance is . Underbody (overall) ground clearance is 9.1 inches (230 mm).\n\nSelectable automatic full-time Control Trac four-wheel drive continues to be offered, and uses a two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4417 transfer case with intelligent locking center multi-disc differential and \"torque biasing\" capability. Four-wheel electronic traction control is standard and off-road underbody skid plate armor is optional. A new default off-road program with throttle response recalibration was added, and is automatically activated when Four Low (lock) mode is selected. Expedition can achieve an off-road crawl ratio of 41.06:1 with a low range ratio of 2.64:1 and rear axle ratio of 3.73:1.\n\nThe SUV also underwent a nip/tuck with a few cosmetic enhancements, both inside and out. Expedition's front end now featured Ford's signature three \"hollow-bar\" grille to complement the SUV's truck close relation to the F-150 and Super Duty pickups. New complex stepped style multifaceted headlamps, side view mirrors with updated LED lane departure indicators, sleeker body work and redesigned tail lamps were also added. The interior received a new dash with F-150-like center stack, center console, redesigned first row captains chair luxury seating, door panels and interior trim.\n\nTo further reduce outside noise intrusion for quieter, more isolated ride comfort, new SoundScreen laminated acoustic and solar tinted windshield was added with thicker laminated side window glass.\n\nThe new SUV was unveiled at the Houston Auto Show rather than at the North American International Auto Show, the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, or the New York International Auto Show where most new models are, as 20 percent of all Expedition sales are in Texas. The third generation Expedition went on sale in August 2006. The first 2007 Expedition to roll off a Ford assembly line was donated by Ford to the Peter family of Jamaica, Queens, New York as part of an episode of the American Broadcasting Company series \"\" that aired May 7, 2006.\n\nIn late 2014, the third generation standard wheelbase U324 Expedition and long-wheelbase U354 Expedition EL/Max underwent a cosmetic and mechanical refresh for the 2015 model year.\n\nStandard features include 6 speed Automatic transmission, 3.5L EcoBoost V6 gasoline engine with Ti-VCT, and 2 wheel drive using the rear wheels.\nAvailable features include: Extended-Length version, 4 wheel drive, Premium Audiophile sound system with in dash six-disc CD changer, rear subwoofer, MP3 device and iPod connectivity, SIRIUS XM satellite radio, HomeLink wireless control system, tri zone automatic climate control for driver, first passenger and rear passengers, PowerFold power stow away side-view mirrors, PowerFold power fold flat third-row seating, Gentex auto-dimming rear view mirror, adaptive pneumatic suspension system, power adjustable pedals, ultrasonic park assist, perforated leather seating, climate-controlled heated and cooled front captain's chairs with 10-way power adjust and memory, second-row captain's chair luxury seating, DVD-based voice activated navigation system with liquid crystal touch display, power moon roof, slimline rear DVD-based entertainment system with flip down LCD screen, power-assisted liftgate and 20-inch chrome-clad aluminium six-spoke wheels with Pirelli Scorpion all-season tires. Some of these features are available on Expedition \"XLT\"; many of them are included on Expedition \"Eddie Bauer\" and Expedition \"Limited\".\n\nUpgraded perforated leather seating, wood and leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio, climate and cruise controls, interior ebony wood trim, stylized blacked-out stepped-style multifaceted headlamps and monochromatic paint finish with body-colored grille and chrome accenting are standard on the \"Limited\".\n\nFor the 2008 model year, power deployable/retractable running boards became available, along with a rear view backup camera system. The camera, which is mounted under the Expedition's center liftgate appliqué, utilizes the Gentex auto dimming rear view mirror's picture-in-mirror technology to display what it sees. Expedition \"King Ranch\" was also reintroduced after being absent from the 2007 model year trim line-up. Expedition \"XLT\" models now get body colored lower body work, replacing the previous black plastic trim and was the Last Ford Model Year for the nine-passenger Front Bench seating option in the Ford Full-Size SUV's from Ford Motor Company (Ford discontinued the 9-passenger Front Bench Seating Option for 2009 and Forward on the old Ford Full-Size SUVs 2009–present)\n\nIn July 2008, Ford's Wayne, Michigan plant started production of the 2009 models until finishing the plants run in December of that same year. In January 2009 production of the Expedition was relocated to the Kentucky Truck Assembly in Louisville along with its sister SUV, the Lincoln Navigator, and the Ford F-Series Super Duty. That plant used to build the Ford Excursion until 2005.\n\nExpedition's 6-speed 6R75 automatic was replaced by an improved version, the 6-speed 6R80 automatic. 6R80 features more robust internals, new software logic and a tow/haul mode (replaces the overdrive lock-out) that utilizes new uphill/downhill gradient shift logic for improved performance while towing or hauling heavy loads. The 6-speed automatic can compensate for altitude, grade/slope and present load conditions. The system also reduces the transmission's tendency to \"hunt\" for the right gear(s) and provides engine braking when descending hills. The nine-passenger front bench seating option has been discontinued for the 2009 model year, leaving only the eight-passenger seating option left with two front bucket seats and two rear bench seats. and the chrome \"Expedition\" name plate badges have been removed from the left and right front doors. The chrome \"Expedition\" name plate badge on the rear liftgate remains.\n\nAdditional features included the now standard FlexFuel capability, which can take gasoline, E85 (85% ethanol/15% gasoline), or any combination of the two, and the newly installed EasyFuel capless fuel-filler system. The 5.4 liter V8/FlexFuel feature also upgraded its power to , while the torque rating stayed the same at . The 2009 model year also boosted its maximum towing capacity to for the 4x2 version, and up to for the 4x4 version.\n\nThe new entertainment features added to the 2009 model year included the optional Ford SYNC, and an all-new DVD-based voice-activated, multi-entertainment/navigational system with liquid crystal touch display. The rearview camera system is now integrated to show the video feed through the navigation screen instead for the rearview mirror, however, the rearview mirror is still used to show images on Expeditions not equipped with the navigation system. The new navigation system features up to 10 gigabytes of storage space for more than 2400 songs, a jukebox function, a screened photo display, iPod/Zune capability for downloading and recharging, ripping CDs, and integrated compatibility for cellphones and Bluetooth; the newly compatible Sirius Travel Link, which allow drivers to access traffic, weather, sports, and local movie listings; and a \"Route Guidance\" mode for road and street information. The steering wheel also has a tilt feature and radio controls, including Ford SYNC buttons, allowing the driver to press the button and use voice commands to activate the system, which became standard on Eddie Bauer, Limited, and King Ranch. The tilt w/radio control feature was optional on the XLT during its Wayne plant built orders, but after production moved to Louisville it became standard. For accessory purposes, a HD radio can be installed upon request at a Ford dealership in the United States. New for 2009 were standard heated second row outboard seats on the Limited and King Ranch models only with either the second row bench seat or the optional bucket seats.\n\nNo major cosmetic or mechanical changes. For the 2010 model year optional packages have now been renamed (to Rapid Specificated Order Codes) and upgraded (100s for XLT, 200s for Eddie Bauer, 300s for Limited, 400s for King Ranch) for the newer models. It has also announced that the 2010 models will now feature Ford's MyKey and trailer sway control as a standard on all trims. The 2010 models were ranked 6th among the top 11 affordable large size SUVs in \"US News & World Report. A diesel version for the 2010 model year did not get past the planning stage. Rain-sensing windshield wipers were added as an optional extra for Eddie Bauer, but standard on the Limited and King Ranch versions.\n\nNo major cosmetic or mechanical changes. HD Radio became a standard on all trims, and a dual DVD system that placed at the headrest area became an optional feature. Another change that was made was in the entry-level trim department, with the Expedition offering the newly designated standard XL entry level with lower black cladding, while the XLT level trim was upgraded along with a new XLT Premium trim with gold cladding, replacing the Eddie Bauer level trim. Also, silver cladding was added as an exterior trim as part of a newly optional XLT Premium Sport Appearance Package. Both Limited and King Ranch trims receive new paint and interior trim. The limited trim also has a chrome grille for a change.\n\nNo major cosmetic or mechanical changes. The second heated row seating option was added to XLT Premium and the front park assists became a standard feature on the Limited and King Ranch trims.\n\nNo major cosmetic changes; however the XL trim and XLT Sport options were dropped, leaving only the XLT, XLT Premium, Limited, and King Ranch trims. Updates made to the 2013 models (which went on sale in August 2012) included the TowCommand trailer brake controller system that is bundled with the heavy-duty trailer towing package, a new internal shift control module which allows the six-speed automatic transmission to tailor shifts to engine demand, 10 equipment levels, three new colors (Blue Jeans Metallic, Kodiak Brown Metallic and Ruby Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat), and a new 20-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels that was available on both the \"Limited\" and \"King Ranch\" trims. The latter trim also featured chrome roof racks and side mirrors. Another notable change can be found on the driver's instrumental panel, with the temperature and fuel gauge trading sides.\n\nNo major cosmetic changes. Only three trims, XLT, Limited and King Ranch are offered. The Sirius XM with Navlink and HD radio is added to the XLT as an optional feature. A new, quieter, mechanical Nivomat adaptive hydraulic load-leveling suspension system is available, in place of the adaptive pneumatic air-ride load-leveling suspension. When properly equipped the Expedition continues to offer top-end towing capability with a braked trailer towing capacity of 9,200 lbs (4,173 kg or 4.6 tons).\n\nOn February 18, 2014, Ford introduced a mid-cycle refresh of the Expedition (U324) and Expedition EL (U354), dubbed the U3242 and U3542 respectively, for the 2015 model year. The \"2\" signifying the second phase of the U324 and U354. The debut was at the Dallas-Fort Worth Auto Show on February 19, 2014; because Texas (especially Dallas and Houston) is an important market. Despite a 27% drop in sales since 2008, Ford is committed to continuing producing the Expeditions. Ford started production on the updated Expedition (and Expedition EL, which will continue to compete with the Suburban and Yukon XL) around the first quarter of 2014 and placed the 2015 models in dealerships in July 2014. Ford announced that the three level trims, XLT, Limited, and King Ranch, will continue to be offered along with a new top of the line Platinum trim. On September 12, 2013, (which was the same day that GM unveiled their next generation SUVs), Automobile Magazine posted a spy shot of the 2015 Expedition, which showed a repositioned tailpipe, and a more upright front fascia which bore a taller, wider grille that appeared inspired by the F-150 and Ford F-Series Super Duty trucks.\n\nOfficial photos released on February 18, 2014 revealed an all-new aggressive armadillo-like three-bar grille, which features step-stacked bars that evoke the appearance of stepped armor-plating on an armadillo's back. All-new thinner headlamps were added, in addition to an all-new front bumper with oversized lower air intake. The new bumper also features a lower chrome bar and twin LED fog lamps that flank the chrome bar. Brightwork was added on the rear liftgate; and the tailpipe was repositioned straight, instead of making a 90 degree turn behind the right rear wheel.\n\nExpedition remained a body-on-frame (BOF), allowing the SUV to retain its heavy-duty truck underpinnings for towing and hauling needs.<ref name=\"http://www.motoring2.com\"></ref> The full-size SUV received the 3.5 liter 24-valve DOHC Ti-VCT EcoBoost V-6 engine which features an aluminium engine block, twin-turbochargers, direct injection, and twin independent variable camshaft timing. Power output for the EcoBoost V-6 will be rated around 365 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque, and will be the only engine featured, dropping the 5.4 liter V-8 that was available in the 2007–2014 models due to Ford wanting to make the Expedition more fuel efficient. Despite the changeover from V-8 to V-6, the Expedition did boost its MPG to 16 (city)/23 (highway) for the 2WD and 15 (city)/21 (highway) for the 4WD, but it is now on par with the GM large-size SUVs, which also boasts the same MPGs as the Expedition. In addition to the new engine, Expedition received an updated 6-speed 6R80 SelectShift intelligent manumatic gearbox with manual shift mode. Expedition also features a new electric power servo-assisted steering and Pull-Drift Compensation (PDC) which detects crosswinds and compensates for it.\n\nThe interior remained similar to the outgoing models, but with upgraded materials and a revised prominent center stack, which introduces the latest version of the 8-inch MyFord Touch touchscreen infotainment and telematics system. Push-to-start engine ignition with intelligent access was added and the four-wheel drive mode selector (for models with 4x4) was revised and repositioned. The TowCommand paddle controls was repositioned over the four-wheel drive mode selector, to make way for revised audio and climate controls on the center stack.\n\nThe new features for 2015 included an optional, revised four-wheel independent suspension system with intelligent continuously-controlled damping (CCD) system that alters suspension settings constantly based on 46 parameters and offers comfort, normal, and sport modes. Expedition is the first Ford vehicle in North America to have continuously-controlled damping. Other new optional features includes blind-spot information system (BLIS) with cross-traffic alert, and a rearview camera and apps for the infotainment system to help with towing and off-road driving, all of which is standard in the Platinum trim, whose seating and interior features include Brunello leather, a red wine color with tuxedo-stripe accents and French seamed stitching, or black leather with Agate Gray accents.\n\nThe selectable automatic full-time \"ControlTrac\" four-wheel drive system continues to be offered, but gains a trio of new off-road electronic systems in the form of Hill Ascent Assist (HAA), Hill Descent Control (HDC), and Ford Truck Apps (FTA). FTA gives off-road orientation/geometry, 4x4 system status, and traction control system status in real-time. The four-wheel electronic traction control system (brake differential locking control) was recalibrated to take into account the new EcoBoost V-6's higher torque output and earlier torque delivery.\n\nEcoBoost Performance\n\nThe heavyweight 6,155 lb (3+ ton) as tested, 2015 Expedition \"Platinum\" with 3.5 EcoBoost V-6 and selectable automatic full-time ControlTrac four-wheel drive was clocked from 0 to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds. The full-size SUV can clip 100 mph in 18.2 seconds, 110 mph in 24.3 seconds, and is electronically safety-limited to 113 mph. Expedition has a near perfect 50:50 front:rear balanced weight distribution and center of gravity positioned at 28.5 inches.\n\nExpedition \"Platinum\" averaged 39.2 mph in a 610 ft slalom run and pulled 0.78g in roadholding skidpad testing. High speed emergency braking from 70 mph to 0 (full stop) was completed in 170 ft. In comparison, the Expedition's main rival took a full 10 feet longer, completing the same emergency brake test in 180 ft.\n\nFor the 2016 model year, most of the features that were introduced from 2015 were carried over. However, the Expedition began adding Ford's upgraded enhanced SYNC3 to its trims, as an optional feature on the XLT and standard on Limited, King Ranch and Platinum. The Limited added Sony's Premium Audio System as a standard.\n\nIn June 2016, Ford began selling the 2017 model year Expedition, with no major changes being made and continued to be offered in XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and Platinum level trims. This is the final year of the third generation Expedition and Expedition EL (U324) and (U354)\n\nThe fourth-generation Expedition, known internally at Ford Motor Company as the \"U553\", was unveiled on February 7, 2017 at the Dallas Cowboys training facility, Ford Center in Frisco, Texas, ahead of its Chicago Auto Show debut. Production of the new Expedition started on September 25, 2017. The vehicles arrived at dealerships in November 2017.\n\nThe all-new Expedition was developed in secret under the U553 program codename and features body-on-frame (BOF) architecture with high-strength lightweight material construction consisting of boron steel and aluminium. The four-door body is constructed from alumimium-alloy, while the frame is constructed from boron steel. The U553 will move to the all-new half-ton hydroformed T3 platform (chassis), which is a modified version of the half-ton platform underpinning the P552 2015 Ford F-150. The T3 platform will use a new four-wheel independent suspension system design. Updated powertrain systems (engines and transmissions) including a Hybrid variant with proprietary parallel hybrid electric-drive system to help increase fuel efficiency are expected. Expedition will gain Ford's new 10-speed 10R80 \"SelectShift\" automatic transmission which will feature artificially intelligent shifting, electronic range select, manual shift mode, and be controlled via a rotary dial on the center console. The next-generation Expedition's chief engineer is Jackie Marshall DiMarco, who is also the chief engineer for the next-generation F-150 pickup.\n\nSpy photographers captured early, engineering test mules of the U553 in late 2015, which sported a crude highly modified non-production intent F-150 SuperCrew body atop the production intent T3 platform chassis. In late 2016, spy photographers managed to capture photos of the actual first pre-production prototypes of the U553, wearing the production intent body on the production intent platform. The styling and appearance of the U553 Expedition is inspired by the U502 Explorer along with elements of the P552 F-150, the vehicle on which the new Expedition is based, and will have a more aerodynamic and streamlined silhouette, with raked windshield and sloped roofline which will lead to a rear liftgate spoiler. The U553 Expedition's C-pillar will be more forward slanted, echoing the forward slanted C-pillar of the U502 Explorer introduced for 2011. In addition the Expedition's body will feature sculpted sides with character lines, similar to the U502 Explorer, as opposed to the straight slab sides of the current Expedition. Expedition's front grill and headlamp design is inspired by the facelifted P552 F-150, with the front bumper retaining a similar design and appearance to its predecessor, the U324 Expedition, after its facelift. It also expanded the standard size version's wheelbase by 3 inches and its length by 4 inches while decreasing the height by one inch (losing 300 pounds in the process) in order to allow more leg room and space.\n\nExpedition (U553) will be one of the very first vehicles in North America to use a new next-generation high speed Controller Area Network 3 (CAN-3) vehicle data bus system. The CAN-3 electrical architecture is akin to a human nervous system and allows the Expedition's various on-board microprocessors and electronic vehicle control systems to communicate or \"talk\" to one another through electronic data that is sent and received. With high speed CAN-3, Expedition can learn and react faster than before.\n\nThe Expedition will be available with selectable automatic full-time four-wheel drive that routes torque through a two-speed dual range transfer case with electronic locking center multi-disc differential. A new electronic locking rear differential will be available to augment the 4x4 system. Both the center and rear locking systems will be teamed with four-wheel electronic traction control (ETC), which simulates a locking front differential by ABS \"brake locking\" the front differential. Expedition's off-road electronic aids Hill Descent Control (HDC) and Hill Ascent Assist (HAA) will be joined by the Terrain Management System adapted from the Ford Raptor. Terrain Management is capable of working with 4L mode, like the Ford Raptor, and has 7 (seven) drive modes to choose from which include Normal, Eco, Sport, Tow/Haul, Gravel/Snow, Mud/Ruts, and Sand. The four-wheel drive system has 3 (three) direct drive modes which include 2H, 4A, and 4L. The 4H mode has now been dropped from the selection, as the Terrain Management computer now controls the electronic center lock of the four-wheel drive system. Terrain Management will engage the electronic center lock for a 50:50 front:rear torque split while in 4A direct drive mode, when the Mud/Ruts or Sand modes are selected. The 4L direct drive mode engages the electronic center lock regardless of the off-road drive mode selected. A \"tap to lock/unlock\" button is located near the drive mode dial for operation of the electronic rear lock.\n\nOff-road geometry figures for approach, departure, and ramp breakover, improve slightly with 23.3°, 21.9°, and 21.4° of obstacle clearance. Minimum running (lowest point) ground clearance increases by a full inch, from 8.7 to 9.8 inches.\n\nExpedition (U553) is certified by the Society of Automotive Engineers' independent SAE J2807 towing standard to tow a maximum 9,300 lbs (4,218 kg or 4.65 tons) of braked trailer. The tow rating increases by 100 lbs over the previous generation and continues to be the highest tow rating among full-size SUVs. Expedition will also feature Pro Trailer Backup Assist, a semi-autonomous system that allows the Expedition to reverse itself with a trailer coupled. The driver directs the system via a control dial, while the Expedition handles all steering and limits reversing speed.\n\nAmong the new features that have been incorporated into the fourth generation Expedition includes a 360-degree camera and park assist system that can make parking much easier, along with optional safety features that will use both camera and radar technology, and include automatic braking, lane-keep assist, active cruise control, and blind-spot monitors. In addition, there are two USB ports per row, four 12-volt outlets and a 120-volt household outlet. Ford has also partnered up with Sling that enables the twin-screen rear entertainment system, as well as personal tablets on the vehicle's Wi-Fi, to watch cable TV content. The Wi-Fi content can be used up to 10 devices and features Apple Car Play and Android Auto capabilities that is compatible to Ford SYNC3 and Ford Pass. There is also at least 40 different spaces and cup holders to allow items to be stored. A dual vista panoramic sunroof is available as an optional feature.\n\nThe fourth generation Expedition will only be available in four level trims as the King Ranch trim (from 2005–2017) was discontinued after the 2017 model year. The three primary trims, XLT, Limited, and the top-of-the-line Platinum, will be available to regular customers, while the fourth trim, XL, will only be exclusive to rental companies, corporate fleets, and government agencies, as they will not have a lot of the features as the aforementioned three trims. The Expedition will still retain its unique (standard) eight passenger seating on all trims like before, with optional seven passenger seating. The MSRP has been listed by Ford for the fourth generation Expedition will be higher than the previous generation, starting at around $52,000 (US) for XLT and $63,000 (US) for Limited level trims.\n\nAll 2018 Expedition models carry a power four-wheel disk antilock brake system (ABS) with brake assist and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), six standard airbags including a Safety Canopy System that provides side-curtain airbags with roll-fold technology and a rollover sensor, rear-door child-safety locks, a LATCH system (Lower Anchors and Tether Anchors for Children), an Individual Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), and a SOS Post-Crash Alert System https://www.ford.com/suvs/expedition/models/expedition-xlt/.\n\nThe Expedition has an available Driver Assistance Package that equips the vehicle with smart driver-assist technology, including pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection and forward collision warning, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, auto high-beam headlamps, and rain-sensing wipers.\n\nAn array of standard security features includes a SecuriLock Passive Anti-Theft System, a perimeter alarm, a personal safety system, SecuriCode Keyless Entry Keypad, MyKey, and available inclination and intrusion sensors.\n\nThe 2018 Expedition SSV is a fleet-only version of the Expedition XLT, and offers similar standard equipment.\n\nStarting off the 2018 Expedition lineup is the XLT trim, which is available in either 4X2 or 4X4 configurations, as well as in the MAX style. Standard features include cloth upholstery, keyless access with push-button start, eighteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, a 60/40 second-row bench seat with CenterSlide seat, Hill Start Assist and Hill Descent Control (4X4 models only), MyFord w/ SYNC radio with 4.3-inch LCD display screen, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, and a nine-speaker audio system, 3.5L EcoBoost Twin-Turbocharged V6 gasoline engine with 375-400 horsepower and 470-480 lb. ft. of torque, remote start, a power-folding third-row bench seat, and more.\n\nA key difference from 2017 is that a surround-sound premium audio system and rear seat entertainment system are no longer available as an option for XLT models, and that push-button start, and a power-folding third-row seat are now standard equipment (this feature was optional on the 2017 XLT).\n\nA trailer towing package, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, heated front and rear seats, SYNC 3 infotainment system with optional GPS navigation, a power panoramic moonroof, heated and ventilated front bucket seats, the FX4 Off-Road Package (4X4 models only), twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and other comfort and convenience features are optional.\n\nThe 2018 Expedition Limited is built with either a 4X2 or 4X4 build, each with a bigger MAX build. The Limited key features include in-vehicle wi-fi with available SYNC Connect, a hands-free foot-activated lift gate, and standard 20-inch ultra bright machined aluminum wheels with dark tarnish painted pockets. A 3.5 EcoBoost engine functions with a 10-speed SelectShift automatic transmission. The Limited also has a 23.3-gallon fuel tank. A heavy duty engine radiator and two-speed automatic four-wheel-drive with neutral towing capability are optional.\n\nThe Limited has the equivalent power and handling features of the XLT, though it comes with standard all-season tires. The standard power and handling features include a two-wheel rear-wheel drivetrain, multilink independent rear suspension, Electronic Power Assist (EPAS) rack and pinion steering, Advance Trac with stability control, which is designed to provide stability and traction by reducing the chance of spinning the drive wheel, trailer sway control, traction control, and a non-limited-slip 3.15 rear axle on the 4x2 model. A 4X4 Limited build and 4X2 MAX build has a standard 3.31 drive ratio, while a 4X4 MAX build has a 3.73 drive ratio.\n\nA Terrain Management System and hill start assist and hill descent control is available for 4x4 models.\n\nOptional features on the Limited include a Control Trac four-wheel-drive system, a non-limited-slip 3.31 rear axle or electronic limited-slip differential 3.72 rear axle, continuously controlled damping (CCD) suspension, and an integrated brake controller with the Heavy Duty Trailer Tow package.\n\nUnlike the XLT model, the Limited has standard Dual Zone Electronic Automatic Temperature Control (DEATC), and rear auxiliary climate controls.\n\nStandard entertainment features include a Harman 12-speaker B&O Play Audio System, a SYNC 3 Enhanced Voice Recognition Communications and Entertainment System, SYNC Connect and FordPass, SiriusXM Radio, and HD Radio.\n\nThe cabin has perforated, leather-trimmed, heated and ventilated bucket front seats, heated second-row outboard seats, second-row power folding tip and slide seats, power folding and reclining third-row seats, and third-row power-folding headrests. Second-row power folding tip and slide bucket seats are optional.\n\nThe Limited has six smart-charging multimedia USB ports, with two in each row, and a wireless charging hub on the center console. The cabin also features 15 cupholders, analog RPM and speed gauges with digital minor gauges, and an 8-inch center display.\n\nOther standard interior features include a cargo management system and protector, power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, four 12-volt power points and a 110-volt / 150-watt AC power outlet, a rotary gear shift dial, woodgrain appliqués, and a heated, leather-wrapped power tilt/telescoping steering wheel with audio controls. The cabin has an illuminated entry system and ambient lighting, with map lights mounted over the front overhead console, dome lights on the second and third rows, and a rear cargo area light. Push-button start systems with intelligent access, a remote start system, and a Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) with cross-traffic alert and trailer tow monitoring are also standard.\n\nOptional interior features include an advanced cargo manager, an enhanced active park assist system, a lane-keeping system, pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection, Pro Trailer Backup Assist, and adaptive cruise control.\n\nPower-deployable running boards are standard on Expedition Limited, and Limited MAX. Each has a unique color with magnetic-painted polished stainless steel accents. Among the other exterior standard features are intermittent front and rear wipers, a windshield wiper de-icer, a rear window defroster and washer, halogen fog lamps, quad-beam reflector headlamps, a halogen projector-beam, incandescent tail-lamps, a hands-free foot-activated lift gate and manual liftglass, a Center High-Mounted Stop Lamp (CHMSL), configurable daytime running lamps, roof-rack side rails, a chrome grille with Magnetic painted accents, and a Class IV trailer hitch receiver. A capless fuel filler is also standard.\n\nRain sensing-front wipers, roof rail cross bars, LED lamps and headlamps, magnetic grille and mirror caps, and front tow hooks are optional.\n\nThe 2018 Expedition Limited has power adjustable heated mirrors with memory capability, security approach lamps, integrated blind spot mirrors, a solartinted windshield and front door windows, and second and third-row privacy glass, and lower bodyside cladding and wheel-lip moldings. A panoramic vista roof is optional.\n\nThe 2018 Expedition Limited has the standard safety features of all Expedition Trims with an additional optional 360-degree split-view camera. The standard features include a four-wheel anti-lock brake system, a rear view camera with backup assist, dual-stage front airbags, three-point safety belts, side-impact airbags, a safety canopy system that includes the third row, rear-door child-safety locks, LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tether Anchors for Children), Individual Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), and an SOS Post-Crash Alert System.\n\nSecurity systems include SecuriLock passive anti-theft system, a remote keyless entry system, a perimeter alarm, a personal safety system, SecuriCode keyless entry keypad, MyKey, and inclination and intrusion sensors.\n\nThe flagship Ford Expedition Platinum will be more upscale and move further upmarket, with high-end interior fit-and-finish and luxury interior and exterior appointments. Interiors will feature handcrafted real wood trim, real metal accents, soft-touch materials, 12-speaker Bang & Olufsen luxury sound system, dual panel panoramic glass roof with power shade, soft premium diamond-quilted perforated leather climate-controlled and massaging seats with French seam stitchwork, soft leather wrapped dash, steering wheel, and door panels with single and double stitched ornamental stichwork. The \"Platinum\"'s exterior will receive standard full LED headlamps vertically stacked in headlamp nacelles, LED turn signal lamps, LED daytime running lamps, LED fog lamps and diffused LED tail lamps with LED brake lamps. In addition, the exterior will feature \"platinum\" satin-finished lower front and rear bumper skid plates, roof rails, side mirror crowns, and liftgate accents, along with polished stainless steel power deployable-and-retractable running boards, polished alloy wheels, chrome brightwork, and platinum satin-finished mesh grillwork. Expedition Platinums will also feature a specific performance tuned version of the 3.5 liter EcoBoost V-6 with 400 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque mated to the 10-speed 10R80 SelectShift automatic transmission.\n\nBoth the Expedition and long-wheelbase Expedition MAX will be available with the Platinum treatment, and will be the most expensive level trim, with a MSRP of $73,900 (US) for standard and $76,000 (US) for the MAX version, with the 4WD option topping off on the latter at $79,000 (US).\n\nOn June 16, 2017, Ford announced that an off-road package Expedition FX4 will become available starting with the 2018 model year, with an announced MSRP at around $63,000 (US). This option, available to 4WD XLT level trims only and targeted towards the 20% of Expedition owners who use the vehicle for off-road purposes, is expected to compete with the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe Z71 package in both standard and MAX versions. Among the detailed features are patented electronic locking limited-slip rear differential, Off-road-tuned shocks, All-terrain tires, Seven different skid plates that serve as underbody armor and protect critical areas, Unique 18-inch Magnetic Metallic-painted cast-aluminum wheels, Chrome running boards, FX4 badging on the liftgate and front fender, and New rubber floor liners. According to Mike Kipley, the engineering manager for the Expedition, \"The FX4 Off-Road package delivers off-road driving confidence,” adding that “The technology we’re using works to adapt to different driving conditions so customers can enjoy the adventure without worry.”\n\nThe 2018 Expedition's die-cast aluminum 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine operates with a twin-independent Variable Camshaft Timing (Ti-VCT) valvetrain, and a 10-speed automatic SelectShift transmission. The engine makes 375 horsepower and 470 lb.-ft. of torque at 5,000 rpm in XLT and Limited trims, and 400 horsepower 480 lb.-ft. of torque at 5,000 rpm in the Platinum trim. It’s backed up by a gasoline direct injection fuel delivery system with a single, stainless steel exhaust. The drive ratio is 3.15 on a standard 4x2; 3.31 on standard 4x4 and 4x2 MAX; and 3.73 on a 4x4 MAX. The engine’s compression ratio is 10:5:1.\n\nAs part of the shift to the T1 platform for the 2007 model year, Ford developed an extended-length version of the Expedition, to more closely match the Chevrolet Suburban/GMC Yukon in size. Introduced as the \"Ford Expedition EL\" (EL=extended length alongside the Lincoln Navigator L, the variant effectively replaced the Super Duty-based Ford Excursion. In Canada, to avoid confusion with the Acura EL sedan, Ford renamed the extended-length version as the \"Expedition Max\".\n\nOriginally intended to carry the Ford Everest name, Ford product planners changed their minds, as the nameplate was already in use for a midsize Ford SUV in Asia. Outside North America, including the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam, the Expedition EL is also imported to and sold in the Middle East and Taiwan. In the Philippines, the Expedition EL is the only version imported and sold; coincidentally, it is also a market where the Ford Everest SUV is sold.\n\nFor the 2007 model year, Ford introduced the extended-length Expedition EL/Max. With a wheelbase stretched 12 inches (to 131 inches) and a length increased 14.8 inches (to 221.3 inches) over the standard Expedition, the EL/Max is sized comparably to the Suburban/Yukon XL, providing additional cargo space over the standard-wheelbase version. The extended-length body of the EL/Max is distinguished by its longer cargo-area windows and its rear door design (the rear wheels no longer intrude into the lower half of the doors).\n\nAlongside the standard-length Ford Expedition, the EL/Max was offered with a single powertrain; the 5.4L Triton V8 was standard from 2007 to 2014, replaced by the twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 for 2015 to 2017. The EL/Max is also sold with both rear-wheel and four-wheel drive configurations. The larger overall size restricted towing capacity by approximately 300 pounds, to (for 2WD) and (for 4WD) over a standard-wheelbase example.\n\nOver its first-generation, the EL/Max shared its features with the standard-length Expedition; for 2012 model, a cargo organizer became an exclusive feature. The Expedition EL was introduced in 4 trim lines: XLT, Eddie Bauer, Limited, and the King Ranch series during the 2007–2010 model year. For 2011, the Eddie Bauer trim was replaced by XLT and XLT Premium, with XL becoming the new base trim level. After 2012, all versions of the XL trim were dropped.\n\nFor 2015, the EL/Max received the same facelift and upgrades as the standard-length Expedition.\n\nAlongside the standard-length Expedition, the EL/Max also received a 5-star rating from the NHTSA. The Expedition EL was also ranked 9th among the top 15 \"Best Family Haulers\", according to a June 2009 consumers favorite survey conducted by Edmunds.\n\nOn February 7, 2017, Ford announced that the Expedition EL will now take the name Expedition MAX (Max is now stylized with all capitals as MAX) nameplate as the rest of the world when the fourth generation models debut in November 2017 for the 2018 model year (in actuality, the MAX is a second generation SUV). Like the standard size Expedition, this was also unveiled ahead of the Chicago Auto Show and will carry the same features and the three featured trims, XLT, Limited, and Platinum. It also expanded its length size by one inch to allow more space and legroom in the third seat row. Although the rear passenger doors were widened, the aft wheel well trim still doesn't cut into them.\n\nThis version is expected to become more competitive with the Suburban/Yukon XL in the long wheelbase SUV segment, an area where GM dominates; when photos for the fourth generation Expedition were released, a majority of the pictures and videos indicated where Ford wants to target the MAX. Like the (standard length) Expedition, the (extended length) Expedition MAX will also still retain its (standard) eight passenger seating on all trims like before. The MAX will also see a starting MSRP range of $55,000 (US) for the XLT and $66,800 (US) for the Limited level trims, making this more expensive than the Suburban but on par with the Yukon XL in terms of pricing.\nThe standard size Expedition are sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the CNMI, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam, Republic of China Taiwan, the Philippines, the Middle East, Central America, the Caribbean, South America (except Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela), Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia and South Korea), Africa (Algeria, Angola, Cape Verde, Egypt, Gabon, Ghana, Libya, Madagascar, Morocco, Nigeria and Senegal), and Central Asia (Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan).\n\nAfter the 2015 refresh, the standard size Expedition became exclusive to the United States, Canada, Mexico, Republic of China (Taiwan), and the Middle East. The US and Canadian Expeditions are available in XLT, Limited, King Ranch and Platinum, while The Mexican Expedition offers the XLT, Limited, and King Ranch trims. The Middle East Expeditions are offered in XL, XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and in Platinum (RWD only) trims.\n\nWith the introduction of the fourth generation Expedition, Ford will make the SUV available to North America in the Fall of 2017 first, followed by a global launch in early 2018, where it will go on sale in selected countries.\n\nFor the Expedition EL/Max, all six versions (XL, XLT/Eddie Bauer, XLT Platinum/Sport, Limited, King Ranch and Platinum) are available in the United States. From the 2007 to 2010 model years, The EL/Max level trims were limited to only 3 versions for Canada, Republic of China (Taiwan), and The Middle East, two for Mexico, and one for the Philippines. Canada's Expedition Max offered the Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch trims, Mexico's Expedition Max in Limited and King Ranch trims, and the Middle East's EL level trims in XLT, Eddie Bauer and Limited. The Philippines' lone Expedition EL level trim was the Eddie Bauer model from 2007 to 2010.\n\nAfter the 2011 model year Ford made changes in the international exportation of the EL/Max trims. As a result of the changes, the Limited trim became the only version available in Canada and Mexico as Eddie Bauer (in Canada) and King Ranch trims (in both Canada and Mexico) were discontinued, while the Philippines and the Middle East replaced the Eddie Bauer with the XLT trim. The Middle East also started to get all of the 5 US level base trims, including the new XL trims that took the XLT's place and the King Ranch trim.\n\nWith the 2015 refresh, the Expedition EL US level trims are the same as the standard versions: XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and Platinum, all four available in rear wheel and four wheel drive. The Canadian Expedition Max are only featured in Limited and Platinum level trims, also available in RWD and 4WD. Mexico's Expedition Max are available in rear wheel drive XLT only, but available in RWD and 4WD Limited versions. The Philippines, Republic of China (Taiwan), and Middle East ELs are only available in 4WD Limited trims.\n\nWith the introduction of the Expedition Max for the 2018 model year as the successor to the first generation Expedition EL, Ford plans to make the vehicle available globally, with North America in late 2017 and selected countries in early 2018.\n\nSelectable automatic full-time Control Trac four-wheel drive designed by BorgWarner is standard on all 4x4 Expeditions. There are four modes: Two High mode, Auto mode, Four High mode and Four Low mode. Each mode can be selected via a rotary control dial on the dash.\n\nThe Expedition's system uses a two-speed dual range BorgWarner transfer case with a software controlled variable intelligent locking center multi-disc differential. The four-wheel drive system does not use a planetary or bevel geared center differential, which are typically found in permanent four-wheel drive systems where torque is supplied to all four wheels.\n\n4WD Expeditions come with standard dual front frame-mounted closed-loop recovery hooks and available off-road under body protection. Steel plates are placed over vital areas with a composite shield for the fuel tank. Expedition 4x4s are tested alongside the F-150 and Super Duty trucks at Ford's California and Arizona proving grounds. Expedition is put through the same durability tests and evaluations to meet the same durability standards as its pickup truck brethren.\n\nRear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive have conventional open-type differentials with a choice of axle ratios. Traction control systems, both mechanical and electronic, are optional.\n\nMechanical traction control (1997–2006)\n\nBoth first and second generation Ford Expeditions (UN93 and U222) had optional \"Traction-Lok\" rear limited-slip differential (LSD). The clutch packs inside the LSD tend to be weak, will wear over time, gradually losing their ability to transfer torque, and LSD will function like an open-type differential. The front differential on four-wheel drive models are open-type differential. The \"AdvanceTrac\" electronic stability control for the 2003 model year. The 2006 was the last model year for the Traction-Lok limited-slip differential.\n\nElectronic traction control (2003–present)\n\n\"AdvanceTrac\" electronic stability control was introduced for the 2003 model year as an optional extra on the second generation Ford Expedition (U222). Bundled with the electronic stability control system is four-wheel electronic traction control (functions at all wheels) for Expeditions with four-wheel drive. Two-wheel drive Expeditions only receive two-wheel electronic traction control for rear wheels. \"AdvanceTrac\" was made standard equipment on all third generation Expeditions (U324).\n\nThe traction control system uses four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) to apply and release the disc brakes on the drive wheel that has lost traction. The ABS clamps down on the slipping drive wheel or wheels, \"brake locking\" the differential, which can transfer up to 100 percent of supplied torque to the opposing drive wheel with better traction. By ABS \"brake locking\" both the front \"and\" rear differentials, the traction control system can simulate front and rear differential locks. The system works even if two of its drive wheels (one front, one rear) are completely off the ground.\n\nUsing the ABS brakes rather than mechanical limited-slip or locking devices inside the axle differentials gives quicker response, more seamless performance, and enhanced durability.\n\nStarting with the 2018 model year, the Expedition and Expedition MAX will utilize Ford's Terrain Management System. Buttons to control the 4x4 system are arranged around the central Terrain Management dial. The system is similar to the one found in the 2011–present Explorer, however the Explorer's system is more simplified. The Expedition's Terrain Management System is adapted from the SVT Raptor to allow use of a 4L (low-lock) mode as well as an electronic locking rear differential. Moreover, the Explorer's Terrain Management System has 4 (four) drive modes, while the Expedition has 7 (seven) drive modes, not including the 3 (three) 4x4 system direct drive modes.\n\nDepending on the mode selected, Terrain Management will control, adjust, and fine tune the engine, transmission, center multi-disc differential lock, throttle response, four-wheel electronic traction control and electronic stability control (ESC) to adapt the SUV for optimal performance on the corresponding terrain.\n\nWhen first introduced in 1996, the Expedition competed with both the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon in the full-size half-ton SUV towing segment. New competitors included the Dodge Durango (which was discontinued in 2009, but reintroduced in 2011), Nissan Armada, and Toyota Sequoia. Product research conducted by Ford indicated that 92 percent of Expedition owners use the SUV for vacations. Some 60 percent use it to transport outdoor sports equipment, while 40 percent of Expedition owners use the vehicle for towing. The half-ton Expedition EL/Max competes with the half-ton Chevrolet Suburban 1500 and GMC Yukon XL 1500 in the towing segment.\n\nSince its introduction, the Expedition's braked trailer towing capacity has grown from 8,100 lbs (3,674 kg or 4.05 tons) to a current rating of 9,200 lbs (4,173 kg or 4.6 tons) when properly equipped. The list of towing features is also ever growing. Towing features common to all generations of the Expedition include: smallest possible turning radius for increased trailer maneuverability, large side view mirrors to improve rearward visibility, rearward-facing lane departure indicators which are helpful to other motorist when the Expedition is towing a long trailer providing added visual safety, heavy-duty flashers, heavy-duty large disc brakes to withstand prolonged braking while towing, and an available heavy-duty trailer towing package which includes necessary additions for heavy-duty towing.\n\nAs of the 2010 model year, the Expedition received trailer sway control (TSC) as standard equipment. TSC detects trailer oscillations and corrects it via asymmetrical ABS braking and reducing engine power until the Expedition and its trailer are both back under control.\n\nExpeditions equipped with the heavy-duty trailer towing package are prepped and readied, at the factory, for towing. The package includes a VESC (Vehicle Equipment Safety Commission) V-5 (or SAE J684) Class IV (Class 4) rated trailer hitch with weight distribution capability, heavy-duty radiator, heavy-duty auxiliary transmission fluid cooler, and hitch mounted 4 and 7-pin trailer electrical connectors.\n\nFor model years prior to 2013, these Expeditions are prewired for later installation of an after-market electronic trailer brake controller. The brake controller wiring harness is located under the dash on the driver's side. For the 2013 model year onward, these Expeditions are factory equipped with the TowCommand electronic trailer brake controller system. This features +/– gain brake adjustment with support for heavy-duty trailers with up to four axles (quad axle trailers) and is compatible with electrically actuated trailer drum brakes and electric-over-hydraulic (EOH) actuated trailer drum or disc brake systems. The trailer brake controller is fully integrated into the Expedition's four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS), and trailer sway control (TSC).\n\nExpeditions were offered with an adaptive pneumatic air-ride suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and trailer load leveling capability from 1997 to 2013. For the 2014 model year, a Nivomat adaptive hydraulic suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and trailer load leveling replaced the pneumatic system. Both systems can automatically detect when a heavy trailer is coupled, such as a travel trailer, and level the load. Additional ride-height sensors placed on the left and right sides of the SUV also monitor and compensate for any listing caused by improper cargo loading. This keeps the Expedition running straight and level while towing, and at night helps to keep the Expedition's headlamps from blinding oncoming traffic.\n\nTo compete with large police SUVs that are sold by other automobile companies, primarily the Chevrolet Suburban, Ford has made a special version of the Expedition available to law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and EMS agencies. Ford calls it the Expedition Special Service Vehicle (SSV). The only differences between the standard Expedition and the Special Service Vehicle Expedition are provisions for emergency services related equipment such as radios, lightbars, and sirens.\n\nWith the fourth generation Expedition (2018–present) debuting in 2017, Ford announced that the standard size version will be sold to government agencies and law enforcement, available in the lower based XL trim only.\n\n2008 was the only year for the Funkmaster Flex special edition Expedition. In 2005, Ford Motor Company teamed up with rapper and New York City radio personality Funkmaster Flex in a multi-year partnership to create a series of special edition Ford vehicles and advertise the Ford brand. One of those creations was a 2008 Ford Expedition bearing the rapper's name. This limited production Expedition featured a special Colorado Red and black two-tone paint job with orange pinstriping, 20 inch chrome wheels, 3D Carbon body kit, Funkmaster Flex badging and a custom black and Colorado Red leather interior on top of Expedition \"Limited\" standard equipment. The FMF Expedition went on sale in the fall of 2007 and production was limited to 650 units total.\n\n\"Motor Trend\" gave the 2018 Expedition a good review in its February 14, 2018 article, in which they cite the vehicle’s “blend of performance (both on- and off-road), comfort, utility, and tech [that] easily make it the new benchmark for the full-size SUV class.” However the review notes that there were a few drawbacks in terms of hp acceleration (coming in second to the 2018 Nissan Armada but ahead of the 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe), off-road performance, and its MPG estimate.\n\nThe 2018 Expedition also ranked first among large SUVs with a score of 9.3 from U.S. News and World Report.\n\nThe fourth generation Ford Expedition was nominated at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in the Truck of the Year category, only to lose out to its co-branded cousin Lincoln Navigator. The Expedition was runner-up.\n\n"}

One has a series of notches cut transversely along its side and a smaller wooden stick or a propeller attached to the end with a nail or pin. This stick is held stationary in one hand with the notches up, and the other stick is rubbed rapidly back and forth across the notches. This causes the propeller to rotate. Sometimes also known as a ouija windmill, a hoodoo stick or a VooDoo stick. The word \"whammy\" is sometimes \"whimmy\" and the word \"diddle\" sometimes \"doodle\", giving it three possible other names, and the \"gee-haw\" may also be dropped.\n\n\"Gee-haw\" refers to the fact that, by rubbing your finger against the notched stick while rubbing, the direction of the spinning propeller may be reversed. The operator may do this surreptitiously and yell \"gee\" or \"haw\" to make it appear that the propeller is reacting to the commands. If you call it a \"hooey stick\", you would yell \"hooey\" each time you want the direction to change.\n\nThe nail holding the propeller must pass through a hole of approximately twice its diameter, essentially a twirling hoop on a stick. The side force of the finger or thumb on the notched stick forces it to the side as each notch is hit thus giving it a repeating side jump to pivot the propeller in one direction or the other. A nicely balanced propeller will spin just fine and it actually is not critical to have it heavy to one side, because the hole diameter always allows one side (slightly longer) to drop during the jerking motion which occurs. \nTo observe the effect, the propeller attached to the end of the ribbed stick must not be pinned at its exact centre of mass, i.e. off-center or loose. For a functioning whammy diddle, there should be a \"preferred\" angle (i.e. when stationary, if the propeller is rotated around its axis and then released, it should return to its lowest-energy rest angle relative to the ribbed stick.) Rubbing the ribbed stick with another stick along the grooves creates a vertical alternating driving force formula_1 acting on the centre of mass of the propeller:\n\nwhere formula_3 and T is the time taken for the stick to move from one groove to the next; formula_4 is some unknown scaling factor that characterizes the force with which the two sticks are pressed against one another. By rubbing a finger against these grooves on the side, one can also introduce a \"horizonal\" alternating driving force formula_5\n\nwhere formula_7 is a phase shift (describing the lag time between when the grooves contacts the moving rod, and finger respectively) and, again, X is some unknown scaling factor. Importantly, formula_8 is the \"same\" frequency, and the two driving forces are said to be phase locked. The confluence of two phase matched driving forces in orthogonal directions gives rise to a rotational force on the centre of mass at the propeller end, and thus, rotation.\n\nWhen the operator of the whammy-diddle surreptitiously changes the side at which his/her finger contacts the stick (e.g. by contacting with his thumb instead of his fore-finger, or by changing the side at which a finger contacts the grooves of the base) he or she changes the sign of the phase formula_7, and thus reverses the rotation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are generated from percentage transformation-vs time measurements, and are useful for understanding the transformations of an alloy steel at elevated temperatures. \n\nAn isothermal transformation diagram is only valid for one specific composition of material, and only if the temperature is held constant during the transformation, and strictly with rapid cooling to that temperature. Though usually used to represent transformation kinetics for steels, they also can be used to describe the kinetics of crystallization in ceramic or other materials. Time-temperature-precipitation diagrams and time-temperature-embrittlement diagrams have also been used to represent kinetic changes in steels.\n\nIsothermal transformation (IT) diagram or the C-curve is associated with mechanical properties,microconstituents/microstructures, and heat treatments in carbon steels. Diffusional transformations like austenite transforming to a cementite and ferrite mixture can be explained using the sigmoidal curve; for example the beginning of pearlitic transformation is represented by the pearlite start (P) curve. This transformation is complete at P curve. Nucleation requires an incubation time. The rate of nucleation increases and the rate of microconstituent growth decreases as the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature reaching a maximum at the bay or nose of the curve. Thereafter, the decrease in diffusion rate due to low temperature offsets the effect of increased driving force due to greater difference in free energy. As a result of the transformation, the microconstituents, Pearlite and Bainite, form; Pearlite forms at higher temperatures and bainite at lower.\n\nAustenite is slightly undercooled when quenched below Eutectoid temperature. When given more time, stable microconstituents can form: ferrite and cementite. Coarse pearlite is produced when atoms diffuse rapidly after phases that form pearlite nucleate. This transformation is complete at the pearlite finish time (P).\n\nHowever, greater undercooling by rapid quenching results in formation of martensite or bainite instead of pearlite. This is possible provided the cooling rate is such that the cooling curve intersects the martensite start temperature or the bainite start curve before intersecting the Pcurve. The martensite transformation being a diffusionless shear transformation is represented by a straight line to signify the martensite start temperature.\n\n\n"}

It occurs within a plasma with an associated electric field, that causes convection of ions and electrons inward towards a central twisting filamentary axis. A temperature gradient within the plasma will also cause chemical separation based on different ionization potentials.\n\nIn Marklund's paper, the plasma convects radially inwards towards the center of a cylindrical flux tube. During this convection, the different chemical constituents of the plasma, each having its specific ionization potential, enters into a progressively cooler region. The plasma constituents will recombine and become neutral, and thus no longer under the influence of the electromagnetic forcing. The ionization potentials will thus determine where the different chemicals will be deposited.\nThis provides an efficient means to accumulate matter within a plasma. In a partially ionized plasma, electromagnetic forces act on the non-ionized material indirectly through the viscosity between the ionized and non-ionized material.\nHannes Alfvén showed that elements with the lowest ionization potential are brought closest to the axis, and form concentric hollow cylinders whose radii increase with ionization potential. The drift of ionized matter from the surroundings into the rope means that the rope acts as an ion pump, which evacuates surrounding regions, producing areas of extremely low density.\n"}

The only times multiple vortices may be visible are when the tornado is first forming or when condensation and debris is balanced enough so that subvortices are apparent without being obscured. They can add over 100 mph to the ground-relative wind in a tornado circulation, and are responsible for most (if not all) cases where narrow arcs of extreme destruction lie right next to weak damage within tornado paths.\n\nSuction vortices (or suction spots) are really substructures of many, perhaps all, tornadoes but are not always easily visible. These occur, usually, at the base of the tornado vortex where the tornado makes contact with the surface. Subvortices tend to form after vortex breakdown reaches the surface and are resultant from the ratio of cyclonically incoming and rising air motions. Multivortex structure is not unique to tornadoes, occurring in other circulations such as dust devils, but is a natural result of the physics of vortex dynamics.\n\nMultivortex tornadoes should not be confused with cyclically tornadic supercells. These systems can have the tendency to produce many, and very separate tornadoes, called tornado families, existing either at the same time or in succession. A phenomenon similar in nature to multiple vortices is the satellite tornado. It is different from a multiple-vortex tornado in that it exists \"outside\" of the main tornado and forms via a different mechanism.\n\nThe destructive May 2011 EF5 Joplin tornado was an example of a multiple-vortex tornado.\n\nThe largest tornado ever documented was a multiple-vortex tornado; it struck El Reno, Oklahoma on May 31, 2013 taking the lives of tornado researcher Tim Samaras, his son Paul, and their TWISTEX colleague, Carl Young.

{"id": "42292554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42292554", "title": "Nigerian energy supply crisis", "text": "Nigerian energy supply crisis\n\nThe Nigerian energy supply crisis refers to the ongoing failure of the Nigerian power sector to provide adequate electricity supply to domestic households and industrial producers despite a rapidly growing economy, some of the world's largest deposits of coal, oil and gas and the country's status as Africa's largest oil producer. Currently only 40% of Nigeria's population is connected to the energy grid whilst power supply difficulties are experienced around 60% of the time. At best, average daily power supply is estimated at four hours, although several days can go by without any power at all.\n\nPower supply difficulties cripple the agricultural, industrial and mining sectors and impede the Nigeria's ongoing economic development. The energy supply crisis is complex, stems from a variety of issues and has been ongoing for decades. Most Nigerian businesses and households that can afford to do so run one or more diesel-fueled generators to supplement the intermittent supply.\n\nSince 2005, Nigerian power reforms have focused on privatizing the generator and distribution assets and encouraging private investment in the power sector. The government continues to control transmission assets whilst making \"modest progress\" in creating a regulatory environment attractive to foreign investors. Minor increases in average daily power supply have been reported.\n\nUntil the power sector reforms of 2005, power supply and transmission was the sole responsibility of the Nigerian federal government.\n\nAs of 2012, Nigeria generated approximately 4,000 - 5,000 megawatts of power for a population of 150 million people as compared with Africa's second largest economy, South Africa, which generated 40,000 megawatts of power for a population of 62 million. An estimated 14 - 20 gigawatts of power is provided by private generators to make up for the shortfall. Nigeria has a theoretical capacity of more than 10,000 megawatt generation capacity using existing infrastructure, but has never reached close to that potential.\n\n96% of industry energy consumption is produced off-grid using private generators.\n\nIssues affect all areas of the sector, from generation to transmission to distribution.\n\nCurrently the only plan the government has in place to help solve the energy crisis is to expand the fossil fuel burning sector. Alternative forms of energy are not used probably because of availability of oil in Nigeria, as it has the world’s seventh largest oil reserves.\n\n\nThe most efficient location for new power plants is the Niger Delta region due to the easy access to the sources of energy needed to run the plants. Currently however, a security crisis in the region involving armed militias makes it an unattractive location for foreign investment in power.\n\nPost-reforms the transmission network continues to be government owned and operated and remains the weakest link in the power sector supply chain. Transmission lines are old and at the point of system collapse on any given day. Even should more power be generated, the transmission network is unable to carry any additional power loading. Designed for a peak capacity of only 3,000 to 3,500MW per day breakdown of the lines is a daily occurrence. Lack of maintenance and security challenges in parts of the country only add to the difficulties.\n\nCurrently Nigeria uses four different types of energy: natural gas, oil, hydro and coal The energy sector is heavily dependent on petroleum as a method for electricity production which has slowed down the development of alternative forms of energy. Three out of the four above resources used for energy production in Nigeria are linked with increasing greenhouse gas emissions: coal, oil and natural gas, with coal emitting the worst of the three.\n\nSee table below for summary of the environmental impacts of the sources of electricity.\nAccording to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) the importance of sustainability in energy is: the ability to preserve its use, the importance of energy in living standards and for economic development and the significant impacts that energy systems and processes have had and continue to have on the environment (WCED, 1987). Nigeria needs to invest in sustainable resources because of the obvious signs that it will be strongly impacted by environmental change such as: desertification, droughts, flooding, and water shortages. The biggest blow to Nigeria would be the low-lying areas that contain many of their natural resources being flooded if ocean levels rise as predicted (Gujba, Mulugetta & Azapagic, 2011).\nSince further development of hydro-electricity does not seem practical because of the dependence on the seasons for amount of water supply (Ajayi, 2009). Wind energy has potential, but is unreliable for consistent energy supply. Nuclear energy could be a viable solution to the energy problem because of its lack of emissions and reliability. Nigeria also has easy access to the uranium needed for the plants (Ejiogu, 2013).\n\nIn light of all this, there is a lot of literature surrounding different proposals of what might be done to help Nigeria develop their potential for renewable electricity. Development of the renewable sources energy is important for the future of world. Nigeria has been in an energy crisis for a decade despite numerous attempts to reform the energy sector (Ejiogu, 2012). The only thing that remains is to figure out which energy source is most practical for Nigeria.\nDevelopment of hydro-electricity does not seem practical because of the dependence on the seasons for amount of water supply as well as the amount of greenhouse gases it emits in the first 10 years of being built (Middleton, 2013). Wind energy has potential, but is unreliable for consistent energy supply.\n\nTwo fields of arguments:\nThe most practical solution was mentioned by Gujba, Mulugetta and Azapagic, (2011). The authors of this article suggested that a harmonization of different forms of energy take place. In their sustainable development scenario they suggested some reliance on renewable energy sources and a slow change from fossil fuels to the renewable energy sources. Since the rural areas are further from the electricity grid and most currently do not have power, each area would become a little hub where they would produce their own power by whatever resource was closest. For example, in the northern areas the mini-grids would work off of wind and solar power energy. Hydropower development would have to increase in order for this to be successful. \nWinkler, Howells and Baumert (2002) talk about envisioning where a country wants to end up before the development of energy resources. This is a great perspective about how to fix the energy crisis because taking the big picture into account before the development of the sector could include things outside of simply fixing the energy crisis such as: poverty eradication, job creation, reducing carbon emissions etc. Fixing the energy supply will solve many problems such as the over pricing of electricity due to the loss of the electricity within the grid (Winkler, Howells & Baumert, 2002)\n"}

In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of the international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP. It was formally named on 28 November 2016. The name is in line with the tradition of honoring a scientist, in this case the nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, who has played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the periodic table. It is one of only two elements named after a person who was alive at the time of naming, the other being seaborgium; it is also the only element whose namesake is alive today.\n\nOganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. The radioactive oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the nuclide Og have been detected. Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds, theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including some surprising ones. For example, although oganesson is a member of group 18 – the first synthetic element to be so – it may be significantly reactive, unlike all the other elements of that group (the noble gases). It was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects. On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element and the last one of the 7th period.\n\nThe Danish physicist Niels Bohr was the first to seriously consider the possibility of an element with an atomic number as high as 118, noting in 1922 that such an element would take its place in the periodic table below radon as the seventh noble gas. Following this, Aristid von Grosse wrote an article in 1965 predicting the likely properties of element 118. These were remarkably early predictions, given that it was not yet known how to produce elements artificially in 1922, and that the existence of the island of stability had not yet been theorized in 1965. It was 80 years from Bohr's prediction before oganesson was successfully synthesised, although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as the heavier congener of radon.\n\nIn late 1998, Polish physicist Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including oganesson. His calculations suggested that it might be possible to make oganesson by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions, and that the fusion probability (cross-section) of that reaction would be close to the lead–chromium reaction that had produced element 106, seaborgium. This contradicted predictions that the cross-sections for reactions with lead or bismuth targets would go down exponentially as the atomic number of the resulting elements increased.\n\nIn 1999, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of livermorium and oganesson, in a paper published in \"Physical Review Letters\", and very soon after the results were reported in \"Science\". The researchers reported that they had performed the reaction\n\nThe following year, they published a retraction after researchers at other laboratories were unable to duplicate the results and the Berkeley lab could not duplicate them either. In June 2002, the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author Victor Ninov. Newer experimental results and theoretical predictions have confirmed the exponential decrease in cross-sections with lead and bismuth targets as the atomic number of the resulting nuclide increases.\n\nThe first genuine decay of atoms of oganesson was observed in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. Headed by Yuri Oganessian, a Russian nuclear physicist of Armenian ethnicity, the team included American scientists of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California. The discovery was not announced immediately, because the decay energy of Og matched that of Po, a common impurity produced in fusion reactions aimed at producing superheavy elements, and thus announcement was delayed until after a 2005 confirmatory experiment aimed at producing more oganesson atoms. On 9 October 2006, the researchers announced that they had indirectly detected a total of three (possibly four) nuclei of oganesson-294 (one or two in 2002 and two more in 2005) produced via collisions of californium-249 atoms and calcium-48 ions.\n\nIn 2011, IUPAC evaluated the 2006 results of the Dubna–Livermore collaboration and concluded: \"The three events reported for the \"Z\" = 118 isotope have very good internal\nredundancy but with no anchor to known nuclei do not satisfy the criteria for discovery\".\n\nBecause of the very small fusion reaction probability (the fusion cross section is or ) the experiment took four months and involved a beam dose of calcium ions that had to be shot at the californium target to produce the first recorded event believed to be the synthesis of oganesson.\nNevertheless, researchers were highly confident that the results were not a false positive, since the chance that the detections were random events was estimated to be less than one part in .\n\nIn the experiments, the alpha-decay of three atoms of oganesson was observed. A fourth decay by direct spontaneous fission was also proposed. A half-life of 0.89 ms was calculated: decays into by alpha decay. Since there were only three nuclei, the half-life derived from observed lifetimes has a large uncertainty: .\n\nThe identification of the nuclei was verified by separately creating the putative daughter nucleus directly by means of a bombardment of with ions,\n\nand checking that the decay matched the decay chain of the nuclei. The daughter nucleus is very unstable, decaying with a lifetime of 14 milliseconds into , which may experience either spontaneous fission or alpha decay into , which will undergo spontaneous fission.\n\nIn a quantum-tunneling model, the alpha decay half-life of was predicted to be with the experimental Q-value published in 2004. Calculation with theoretical Q-values from the macroscopic-microscopic model of Muntian–Hofman–Patyk–Sobiczewski gives somewhat lower but comparable results.\nOne atom of the heavier isotope Og may have been seen in a 2011 experiment at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany aimed at the synthesis of element 120 in the reaction Cm+Cr, but uncertainties in the data meant that the observed chain cannot be definitely assigned to 120 and Og: the data indicates a longer half-life of Og of 181 milliseconds than that of Og, which is 0.7 milliseconds.\n\nIn December 2015, the Joint Working Party of international scientific bodies International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) recognized the element's discovery and assigned the priority of the discovery to the Dubna–Livermore collaboration. This was on account of two 2009 and 2010 confirmations of the properties of the granddaughter of Og, Fl, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as the observation of another consistent decay chain of Og by the Dubna group in 2012. The goal of that experiment had been the synthesis of Ts via the reaction Bk(Ca,3n), but the short half-life of Bk resulted in a significant quantity of the target having decayed to Cf, resulting in the synthesis of oganesson instead of tennessine.\n\nFrom 1 October 2015 to 6 April 2016, the Dubna team performed a similar experiment with Ca projectiles aimed at a mixed-isotope californium target containing Cf, Cf, and Cf, with the aim of producing the heavier oganesson isotopes Og and Og. Two beam energies at 252 MeV and 258 MeV were used. Only one atom was seen at the lower beam energy, whose decay chain fitted the previously known one of Og (terminating with spontaneous fission of Fl), and none were seen at the higher beam energy. The experiment was then halted, as the glue from the sector frames covered the target and blocked evaporation residues from escaping to the detectors. The Dubna team planned to repeat this experiment in 2017.\n\nUsing Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, oganesson is sometimes known as \"eka-radon\" (until the 1960s as \"eka-emanation\", emanation being the old name for radon). In 1979, IUPAC assigned the systematic placeholder name \"ununoctium\" to the undiscovered element, with the corresponding symbol of \"Uuo\", and recommended that it be used until after confirmed discovery of the element. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who called it \"element 118\", with the symbol of \"E118\", \"(118)\", or even simply \"118\".\n\nBefore the retraction in 2002, the researchers from Berkeley had intended to name the element \"ghiorsium\" (\"Gh\"), after Albert Ghiorso (a leading member of the research team).\n\nThe Russian discoverers reported their synthesis in 2006. According to IUPAC recommendations, the discoverers of a new element have the right to suggest a name. In 2007, the head of the Russian institute stated the team were considering two names for the new element: \"flyorium\", in honor of Georgy Flyorov, the founder of the research laboratory in Dubna; and \"moskovium\", in recognition of the Moscow Oblast where Dubna is located. He also stated that although the element was discovered as an American collaboration, who provided the californium target, the element should rightly be named in honor of Russia since the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions at JINR was the only facility in the world which could achieve this result. These names were later proposed for element 114 (flerovium) and element 116 (moscovium). However, the final name proposed for element 116 was instead \"livermorium\", and the name \"moscovium\" was later proposed and accepted for element 115 instead.\n\nTraditionally, the names of all noble gases end in \"-on\", with the exception of helium, which was not known to be a noble gas when discovered. The IUPAC guidelines valid at the moment of the discovery approval however required \"all\" new elements be named with the ending \"-ium\", even if they turned out to be halogens (traditionally ending in \"-ine\") or noble gases (traditionally ending in \"-on\"). While the provisional name ununoctium followed this convention, a new IUPAC recommendation published in 2016 recommended using the \"-on\" ending for new group 18 elements, regardless of whether they turn out to have the chemical properties of a noble gas.\n\nIn June 2016 IUPAC announced that the discoverers planned to give the element the name \"oganesson\" (symbol: \"Og\"), in honour of the Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, a pioneer in superheavy element research for sixty years reaching back to the field's foundation: his team and his proposed techniques had led directly to the synthesis of elements 106 through 118. The name became official on 28 November 2016. Oganessian later commented on the naming:\n\nThe naming ceremony for moscovium, tennessine, and oganesson was held on 2 March 2017 at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.\n\nThe stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after curium, element 96, whose half-life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element. All isotopes with an atomic number above 101 undergo radioactive decay with half-lives of less than 30 hours. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after lead) have stable isotopes. This is because of the ever-increasing Coulomb repulsion of protons, so that the strong nuclear force cannot hold the nucleus together against spontaneous fission for long. Calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilizing factors, elements with more than 103 protons should not exist. However, researchers in the 1960s suggested that the closed nuclear shells around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability, creating an \"island of stability\" where nuclides could have half-lives reaching thousands or millions of years. While scientists have still not reached the island, the mere existence of the superheavy elements (including oganesson) confirms that this stabilizing effect is real, and in general the known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer-lived as they approach the predicted location of the island. Oganesson is radioactive and has a half-life that appears to be less than a millisecond. Nonetheless, this is still longer than some predicted values, thus giving further support to the idea of this \"island of stability\".\n\nCalculations using a quantum-tunneling model predict the existence of several neutron-rich isotopes of oganesson with alpha-decay half-lives close to 1 ms.\n\nTheoretical calculations done on the synthetic pathways for, and the half-life of, other isotopes have shown that some could be slightly more stable than the synthesized isotope Og, most likely Og, Og, Og, Og, Og, Og and Og. Of these, Og might provide the best chances for obtaining longer-lived nuclei, and thus might become the focus of future work with this element. Some isotopes with many more neutrons, such as some located around Og, could also provide longer-lived nuclei. Since these heavier isotopes greatly facilitate future chemical studies of oganesson, due to their expected longer half-lives, the Dubna team plans to conduct an experiment through the second half of 2017 with a heavier target containing a mix of the isotopes Cf, Cf, and Cf with Ca projectiles, aimed at the synthesis of the new isotopes Og and Og; a repeat of this reaction in 2020 at the JINR is planned to produce Og. The production of Og and its daughter Lv in this reaction is also possible. The isotopes Og and Og may also be produced in the fusion of Cm with Ti projectiles, a reaction planned at the JINR and at RIKEN in 2017–2018.\n\nOganesson is a member of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common chemical reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a closed outer valence shell in which its valence electrons are arranged in a 7s7p configuration.\n\nConsequently, some expect oganesson to have similar physical and chemical properties to other members of its group, most closely resembling the noble gas above it in the periodic table, radon.\nFollowing the periodic trend, oganesson would be expected to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy, or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p level, whereas copernicium and flerovium are predicted to have no electron affinity. Nevertheless, quantum electrodynamic corrections have been shown to be quite significant in reducing this affinity by decreasing the binding in the anion Og by 9%, thus confirming the importance of these corrections in superheavy elements.\n\nOganesson is expected to have an extremely broad polarizability, almost double that of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it is expected that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This is very different from the previously estimated values of 263 K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that oganesson would be a gas under standard conditions, and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at standard conditions. If oganesson forms a gas under standard conditions nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions, even if it is monatomic like the other noble gases.\n\nBecause of its tremendous polarizability, oganesson is expected to have an anomalously low ionization energy (similar to that of lead which is 70% of that of radon and significantly smaller than that of flerovium) and a standard state condensed phase. Even the shell structure in the nucleus and electron cloud of oganesson is strongly impacted by relativistic effects: the valence and core electron subshells in oganesson are expected to be \"smeared out\" in a homogeneous Fermi gas of electrons, unlike those of the \"less relativistic\" radon and xenon (although there is some incipient delocalisation in radon), due to the very strong spin-orbit splitting of the 7p orbital in oganesson. A similar effect for nucleons, particularly neutrons, is incipient in the closed-neutron-shell nucleus Og and is strongly in force at the hypothetical superheavy closed-shell nucleus 164, with 164 protons and 308 neutrons.\n\nThe only confirmed isotope of oganesson, Og, has much too short a half-life to be chemically investigated experimentally. Therefore, no compounds of oganesson have been synthesized yet. Nevertheless, calculations on theoretical compounds have been performed since 1964. It is expected that if the ionization energy of the element is high enough, it will be difficult to oxidize and therefore, the most common oxidation state would be 0 (as for the noble gases); nevertheless, this appears not to be the case.\n\nCalculations on the diatomic molecule showed a bonding interaction roughly equivalent to that calculated for , and a dissociation energy of 6 kJ/mol, roughly 4 times of that of . Most strikingly, it was calculated to have a bond length shorter than in by 0.16 Å, which would be indicative of a significant bonding interaction. On the other hand, the compound OgH exhibits a dissociation energy (in other words proton affinity of oganesson) that is smaller than that of RnH.\n\nThe bonding between oganesson and hydrogen in OgH is predicted to be very weak and can be regarded as a pure van der Waals interaction rather than a true chemical bond. On the other hand, with highly electronegative elements, oganesson seems to form more stable compounds than for example copernicium or flerovium. The stable oxidation states +2 and +4 have been predicted to exist in the fluorides and . The +6 state would be less stable due to the strong binding of the 7p subshell. This is a result of the same spin-orbit interactions that make oganesson unusually reactive. For example, it was shown that the reaction of oganesson with to form the compound would release an energy of 106 kcal/mol of which about 46 kcal/mol come from these interactions. For comparison, the spin-orbit interaction for the similar molecule is about 10 kcal/mol out of a formation energy of 49 kcal/mol. The same interaction stabilizes the tetrahedral T configuration for , as distinct from the square planar D one of , which is also expected to have. The Og–F bond will most probably be ionic rather than covalent, rendering the oganesson fluorides non-volatile. OgF is predicted to be partially ionic due to oganesson's high electropositivity. Unlike the other noble gases (except possibly xenon and radon), oganesson is predicted to be sufficiently electropositive to form an Og–Cl bond with chlorine.\n\n\n"}

The index forecasts and sums up political risks around the world that may affect the supply of oil to international markets. It is based on the same methodology as a Purchasing Managers' Index. Around 250 country analysts provide input, which is subsequently used to calculate an index value for each of the world’s 20 largest oil-exporting countries. Each of these country values is subsequently weighted by the exports of the countries in order to compute a single, weighted, global PRIX index number that sums up the political risk for international oil markets during the coming three months.\n\nVariations in oil exports are an important component of global oil price formation. Thus, the PRIX index forecast may help identify potential trajectories of international price of oil. However, other factors than political risks affect the global balance between supply and demand of oil and thus contribute to setting the oil price. The index therefore does not predict the oil price itself as it does not cover economic and technological developments, but it can function as a component in oil price forecasting.\n\nThe index was first published in January 2015. It is updated quarterly and made freely available to the public via the index website and Twitter feed. The index is independent and is not owned by any institutions, companies or governments.\n\nCountry analysts are asked whether political developments during the coming three months are likely to lead to reduced, unchanged, or increased oil exports from a given country. The following diffusion index formula is used to process their answers: INDEX = (P1*1) + (P2*0.5) + (P3*0)\nwhere:\n\nAn index number of 50 means that oil exports are not likely to change. A number above 50 indicates that political developments may lead to higher oil exports, while a value below 50 indicates lower exports. The further away from 50 the index number is, the greater the expected change in exports, and the greater the likelihood of an impact on the oil price. The full theoretical range of index values is 0–100. However, in practice the global index value will normally oscillate around 50 and stay within the range of 40–60.\n\nEach country analyst reports on one of the 20 countries, and is required to have in-depth expertise on that country. Country analysts come from a variety of professional backgrounds, but are normally based in the country that they report on. In some cases country analysts outside the country in question are used, and should then speak the local language, visit the country frequently and follow the political situation closely.\n"}

For instance, sled dogs pull loads but do not normally carry them, while working elephants have been used for centuries to haul logs out of forests.\n\nTraditional pack animals include ungulates such as camels, the domestic yak, reindeer, goats, water buffaloes and llama, and domesticated members of the horse family including horses, donkeys, and mules. Occasionally, dogs can be used to carry small loads.\n\nHauling of goods in wagons with horses and oxen gradually displaced the use of packhorses, which had been important until the Middle Ages, by the sixteenth century.\n\nPack animals may be fitted with pack saddles and may also carry saddlebags.\n\nWhile traditional usage of pack animals by nomadic tribespeople is declining, a new market is growing in the tourist expeditions industry in regions such as the High Atlas mountains of Morocco, allowing visitors the comfort of backpacking with animals. The use of pack animals \"is considered a valid means of viewing and experiencing\" some National Parks in America, subject to guidelines and closed areas.\n\nIn the 21st century, special forces have received guidance on the use of horses, mules, llamas, camels, dogs, and elephants as pack animals.\n\nThe load for oxen is their body weight (1500-2500 pounds) at walking pace and 2X for short hauls. \n\nThe maximum load for a camel is roughly 300 kg.\n\nYaks are loaded differently according to region. In Sichuan, 75 kg is carried for 30 km in 6 hours. In Qinghai, at 4100 m altitude, packs of up to 300 kg are routinely carried, while up to 390 kg is carried by the heaviest steers for short periods.\n\nLlamas can carry roughly 1/4 of their body weight, so an adult male of 200 kg can carry some 50 kg.\n\nLoads for equids are disputed. The US Army specifies a maximum of 20 percent of body weight for mules walking up to 20 miles a day in mountains, giving a load of up to about 150 kg. However an 1867 text mentioned a load of up to 800 pounds (about 360 kg). In India, the prevention of cruelty rules (1965) limit mules to 200 kg and ponies to 70 kg.\n\nReindeer can carry up to 40 kg for a prolonged period in mountains.\n\n\n\n"}

This model proposes that star formation propagates via the action of shock waves produced by stellar winds and supernovae traversing the gas that composes the interstellar medium.\n\nIn contrast to star formation in density-wave theories, which are limited to disk-shaped galaxies and produce global spiral patterns, SSPSF applies equally well to spirals, to irregular galaxies and to any local concentrations of gas in elliptical galaxies.\n\nThe effect may be envisioned as an \"SIR infection model\" in a differentially rotating disk, the host galaxy. The SIR model (perhaps most popularly familiar in the form of Conway's Game of Life) is applied to star formation propagating through the galaxy: Each generation of stars in a neighborhood includes some massive ones whose stellar winds and, soon, supernovae, produce shock waves in the gas (Susceptible material). These lead to collapsing nearby gas clouds, which produce the next generation of stars (Infection propagation); but in the immediate neighborhood, all initially available gas is used, so no further stars are born there for some period of time despite the shocks (Recovery from infection).\n\nIn a non-flattened galaxy, the infection would produce an outward propagating sphere. In a non-rotating flattened (disk) environment, the infection would produce an outward propagating ring. But in a differentially rotating flattened environment, i.e., with mass closer to the galactic center orbiting the center somewhat more quickly, the ring is sheared into an ellipse, the innermost parts moving ahead of the ring's center and the outermost parts lagging. For disk galaxies, virtually all star formation occurs in the disk. In that case, the elongated rings are likewise confined to the disk, and collectively they evolve to appear as (possibly disconnected) segments of spiral arms: See the example, as well as figures in.\n\nIn 1999, the prevailing density wave model for the generation of spiral arms in galaxies was combined with SSPSF in a doctoral thesis by Auer (an idea first suggested by Gerola and Seiden in 1980). Auer concluded that density waves are in fact less effective in producing star formation, and more effective in simply organizing ongoing SSPSF into large-scale (spiral) patterns, ultimately into the Grand Design spiral form if conditions allow.\n\nIn the figure you can see a simulation of a simple model for SSPSF on a circular grid. It is generated by randomly starting star formation in certain boxes of the grid, which propagates to nearby boxes in the grid while time progresses. Star formation dies out with time and a box has a certain regeneration time which prevents it from starting new star formation just after it was active. Adding (differential) rotation to the disk during propagation creates spiral patterns that are of the same nature of those in actual spiral galaxies. Dark spots are areas of active star formation, lighter spots are areas of recent star formation/areas in regeneration. \n\nSSPSF processes were demonstrated in an early prototype (\"Gaslight\") of the 2008 video game Spore.\n\n"}

{"id": "15946878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15946878", "title": "Soil steam sterilization", "text": "Soil steam sterilization\n\nSoil steam sterilization (soil steaming) is a farming technique that sterilizes soil with steam in open fields or greenhouses. Pests of plant cultures such as weeds, bacteria, fungi and viruses are killed through induced hot steam which causes vital cellular proteins to unfold. Biologically, the method is considered a partial disinfection. Important heat-resistant, spore-forming bacteria can survive and revitalize the soil after cooling down. Soil fatigue can be cured through the release of nutritive substances blocked within the soil. Steaming leads to a better starting position, quicker growth and strengthened resistance against plant disease and pests. Today, the application of hot steam is considered the best and most effective way to disinfect sick soil, potting soil and compost. \nIt is being used as an alternative to bromomethane, whose production and use was curtailed by the Montreal Protocol. \"Steam effectively kills pathogens by heating the soil to levels that cause protein coagulation or enzyme inactivation.\"\n\nSoil sterilization provides secure and quick relief of soils from substances and organisms harmful to plants such as:\n\nFurther positive effects are:\n\n\nThrough modern steaming methods with superheated steam at 180–200 °C, an optimal soil disinfection can be achieved. Soil only absorbs a small amount of humidity. Micro organisms become active once the soil has cooled down. This creates an optimal environment for instant tillage with seedlings and seeds. \nAdditionally the method of integrated steaming can promote a target-oriented resettlement of steamed soil with beneficial organisms. In the process, the soil is first freed from all organisms and then revitalized and microbiologically buffered through the injection of a soil activator based on compost which contains a natural mixture of favorable microorganisms (e.g. Bacillus subtilis, etc.). \n\nDifferent types of such steam application are also available in practice, including substrate steaming and surface steaming.\n\nSeveral methods for surface steaming are in use amongst which are: area sheet steaming, the steaming hood, the steaming harrow, the steaming plough and vacuum steaming with drainage pipes or mobile pipe systems. \n\nIn order to pick the most suitable steaming method, certain factors have to be considered such as soil structure, plant culture and area performance. At present, more advanced methods are being developed, such as sandwich steaming or partially integrated sandwich steaming in order to minimize energy and cost as much as possible.\n\nSurface steaming with special sheets (sheet steaming) is a method which has been established for decades in order to steam large areas reaching from 15 to 400 m² in one step. If properly applied, sheet steaming is simple and highly economic. The usage of heat resistant, non-decomposing insulation fleece saves up to 50% energy, reduces the steaming time significantly and improves penetration. Single working step areas up to 400 m² can be steamed in 4–5 hours down to 25–30 cm depth / 90 °C. \nThe usage of heat resistant and non-decomposing synthetic insulation fleece, 5 mm thick, 500 gr / m², can reduce steaming time by about 30%. Through a steam injector or a perforated pipe, steam is injected underneath the sheet after it has been laid out and weighted with sand sacks. \n\nThe area performance in one working step depends on the capacity of the steam generator (e.g. steam boiler):\n\nThe steaming time depends on soil structure as well as outside temperature and amounts to 1-1.5 hours per 10 cm steaming depth. Hereby the soil reaches a temperature of about 85 °C. Milling for soil loosening is not recommended since soil structure may become too fine which reduces its penetrability for steam. The usage of spading machines is ideal for soil loosening. The best results can be achieved if the soil is cloddy at greater depth and granulated at lesser depth. \n\nIn practice, working with at least two sheets simultaneously has proven to be highly effective. While one sheet is used for steaming the other one is prepared for steam injection, therefore unnecessary steaming recesses are avoided.\n\nSteaming with vacuum which is induced through a mobile or fixed installed pipe system in the depth of the area to be steamed, is the method that reaches the best penetration. Despite high capital cost, the fixed installation of drainage systems is reasonable for intensively used areas since steaming depths of up to 80 cm can be achieved. \n\nIn contrast to fixed installed drainage systems, pipes in mobile suction systems are on the surface. A central suction pipeline consisting of zinc-coated, fast-coupling pipes are connected in a regular spacing of 1.50 m and the ends of the hoses are pushed into the soil to the desired depth with a special tool.\n\nThe steaming area is covered with a special steaming sheet and weighted all around as with sheet steaming. The steam is injected underneath the sheet through an injector and protection tunnel. While with short areas up to 30 m length steam is frontally injected, with longer areas steam is induced in the middle of the beet using a T-connection branching out to both sides. \nAs soon as the sheet is inflated to approximately 1 m by the steam pressure, the suction turbine is switched on. First, the air in the soil is removed via the suction hoses. A partial vacuum is formed and the steam is pulled downward.\nDuring the final phase, when the required steaming depth has been reached, the ventilator runs non-stop and surplus steam is blown out. To ensure that this surplus steam is not lost, it is fed back under the sheet.\nAs with all other steaming systems, a post-steaming period of approximately 20–30 minutes is required. Steaming time is approximately 1 hour per 10 cm steaming depth. The steam requirement is approximately 7–8 kg/m².\nThe most important requirement, as with all steaming systems, is that the soil is well loosened before steaming, to ensure optimal penetration.\n\n\"Negative Pressure technique generates appropriate soil temperature at a 60 cm depth and complete control of nematodes, fungi and weeds is achieved. In this technique, the steam is introduced under the steaming sheath and forced to enter the soil profile by a negative pressure. The negative pressure is created by a fan that sucks the air out of the soil through buried perforated polypropylene pipes. This system requires a permanent installation of perforated pipes into the soil, at a depth of at least 60 cm to be protected from plough.\"\n\nA steaming hood is a mobile device consisting of corrosion-resistant materials such as aluminum, which is put down onto the area to be steamed. In contrast to sheet steaming, cost-intensive working steps such as laying out and weighting the sheets don’t occur, however the area steamed per working step is smaller in accordance to the size of the hood. \n\nOutdoors, a hood is positioned either manually or via tractor with a special pre-stressed 4 point suspension arm. Steaming time amounts to 30 min for a penetration down to 25 cm depth. Hereby a temperature of 90 °C can be reached. In large stable glasshouses, the hoods are attached to tracks. They are lifted and moved by pneumatic cylinders. Small and medium-sized hoods up to 12 m² are lifted manually using a tipping lever or moved electrically with special winches.\n\nSandwich steaming, which was developed in a project among DEIAFA, University of Turin (Italy, www.deiafa.unito.it) and Ferrari Costruzioni Meccaniche (see image), represents a combination of depth and surface steaming, offers an efficient method to induce hot steam into the soil. The steam is simultaneously pushed into the soil from the surface and from the depth. For this purpose, the area, which must be equipped with a deep steaming injection system, is covered with a steaming hood. The steam enters the soil from the top and the bottom at the same time. Sheets are not suitable, since a high pressure up to 30 mm water column arises underneath the cover.\n\nSandwich steaming offers several advantages. On the one hand, application of energy can be increased to up to 120 kg steam per m²/h. In comparison to other steaming methods up to 30% energy savings can be achieved and the usage of fuel (e.g. heating oil) accordingly decreases. The increased application of energy leads to a quick heating of the soil which reduces the loss of heat. On the other hand, only half of the regular steaming time is needed. \n\nComparison of sandwich steaming with other steam injection methods relating to steam output and energy demand(*):\n\n(*) in soil max 30% moisture \n\nClearly, Sandwich steaming reaches the highest steam output at the lowest energy demand.\n\nThe partial integrated Sandwich steaming is an advanced combined method for steaming merely the areas which shall be planted and purposely leaving out those areas which shall not be used. In order to avoid risk of re-infection of steamed areas with pest from unsteamed areas, beneficial organisms can directly be injected into the hygenized soil via a soil activator (e.g. special compost). The partial sandwich steaming unlocks further potential savings in the steaming process.\n\nStack steaming is used when thermically treating compost and substrates such as turf. Depending on the amount, the material to be steamed is piled up to 70 cm height in steaming boxes or in small dump trailers. Steam is evenly injected via manifolds. For huge amounts, steaming containers and soil boxes are used which are equipped with suction systems to improve steaming results. Midget amounts can be steamed in special small steaming devices.\n\nThe amount of soil steamed should be tuned in a way that steaming time amounts to at most 1.5 h in order to avoid large quantities of condensed water in the bottom layers of the soil. \n\nIn light substrates, such as turf, the performance per hour is significantly higher.\n\nAncient civilizations in India and Egypt used steam, generated through the targeted usage of incident solar radiation on watered top soil, to sanitize and revive their arable land.\n\nModern soil steam sterilization was first discovered in 1888 (by Frank in Germany) and was first commercially used in the United States (by Rudd) in 1893 (Baker 1962). Since then, a wide variety of steam machines have been built to disinfest both commercial greenhouse and nursery field soils (Grossman and Liebman 1995). In the 1950s, for example, steam sterilization technologies expanded from disinfestation of potting soil and greenhouse mixes to commercial production of steam rakes and tractor-drawn steam blades for fumigating small acres of cut flowers and other high-value field crops (Langedijk 1959). Today, even more effective steam technologies are being developed.\n\n\n\n"}

SRECs exist in states that have Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) legislation with specific requirements for solar energy, usually referred to as a \"solar carve-out\". The additional income received from selling SRECs increases the economic value of a solar investment and assists with the financing of solar technology. In conjunction with state and federal incentives, solar system owners can recover their investment in solar by selling their SRECs through spot market sales or long-term sales, both described below.\n\nSRECs represent the environmental attributes from a solar facility, and are produced each time a solar system produces one thousand Kilowatt-hours (KWh) of electricity. For every 1000 kilowatt-hours of electricity produced by an eligible solar facility, one SREC is awarded. In order for a solar facility to be credited with that SREC, the system must be certified and registered.\n\nIn order to produce SRECs, a solar system must first be certified by state regulatory agencies, usually public service commissions or public utility commissions, and then registered with the registry authorized by the state to create and track SRECs. Once a solar system is certified with the state agency and registered with a registry such as PJM-GATS or NEPOOL-GIS (for Massachusetts), SRECs can be issued using either estimates or actual meter readings depending upon state regulations. In some cases, smaller installations may be able to use estimates, while actual meter readings are required for large installations. Solar installations may be registered in states other than the state in which they are physically located and many SREC aggregators will navigate the certification process on behalf of their customers to ensure that systems are certified in the states with the highest SREC values so as to ensure long-term price stability.\n\nMany states have a law called a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) which mandates that the state’s utility must produce a minimum amount of solar power every year. If they cannot do so with their own power generation facilities they must purchase SRECs. The Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) is the fee that energy suppliers must pay if they fail to secure SRECs as required by their state's RPS. Because energy suppliers and utilities may simply pay the fee if SREC prices approach the fee level, a state's ACP generally sets a cap on the value of SRECs. In rare cases SREC prices have approached and even surpassed ACP levels because SRECs can sometimes be recovered by charging more to electricity customers (rate basing), while ACP payments are usually precluded. In many states, the SACP is scheduled to decline over time with the intention of eventually phasing out the solar industry's reliance on SREC sales as an incentive for installing solar.\n\nSolar RPS requirements are meant to create a marketplace for SRECs and a dynamic incentive for the solar industry. Solar RPS requirements demand that energy suppliers or utilities procure a certain percentage of electricity from qualified solar renewable energy resources in a state. These Energy suppliers and/or utilities can meet solar RPS requirements by purchasing SRECs from homeowners and businesses who own solar systems and produce SRECs. Homeowners and businesses can then utilize the sale of the SRECs they generate to help finance their solar systems. SRECs can be sold a variety of ways, such as on the spot market, at auction, or by negotiating long-term contracts.\n\nSREC supply in a particular state is determined by the number of solar installations qualified to produce SRECs and actually selling SRECs in that state. As more solar systems are built, SREC supply will increase. SREC demand is determined by a state's RPS solar requirement, typically a requirement that a certain percentage of the energy supplied into a state originate from qualified solar energy resources. Load-Serving Entities or organizations that supply electricity into the state are required to meet these requirements. RPS solar requirements in many states are set to increase in the coming decade.\n\nTypically, there is no assigned monetary value to an SREC. SREC prices are ultimately determined by market forces within the parameters set forth by the state. If there is a shortage in SREC supply, pricing will rise, resulting in an increase in the value of the incentive for solar systems and an intended acceleration in solar installations. As SREC supply catches up to SREC demand, pricing will likely decrease, resulting in an intended deceleration in solar installations. Over time, SREC markets are designed to find the equilibrium price that encourages enough installation to meet the growing demand set forth by the RPS. Generally speaking, SREC prices are a function of (1) a state's solar alternative compliance payment (SACP), (2) the supply and demand for SRECs within the relevant state, and (3) the term or length over which SRECs are sold.\n\nSpot price for SRECs are generally higher than prices found in long-term contracts since the system owner is taking on market risk. If increases in supply outpace the growing demand, spot prices could fall. SRECs have traded as high as $680 in New Jersey. Meanwhile other state SREC market prices range from $45 in Delaware to $271.05 in Massachusetts. In addition to the strength of spot market demand in states experiencing supply shortages, the general lack of availability of viable long-term contracts and the heavy discounts applied to these contracts have left some system owners and project developers seeking ways to finance solar through spot transactions. In June 2010, Diamond Castle, a New York based private equity firm, announced that it would be financing projects strictly with equity in order to avoid the premiums paid in long-term contracts.\n\nIn addition to providing cash flow security and stability, long-term SREC contracts are often required by banks or other lending institutions unwilling to accept market and legislative risk associated with SREC markets. However, SREC contracts longer than 3 years can be difficult to secure in some SREC markets because in deregulated electricity markets, energy suppliers rarely have electricity supply contracts longer than three years. Some SREC aggregators have managed to negotiate 3-10 year agreements and are able to offer similar length contracts to their residential and commercial customers. In most cases, long-term contracts demand some sort of premium over market prices to compensate the off-taker for putting up the credit to guarantee the contract in the event that prices drop. This premium is also affected by the general lack of availability of credible off-takers in the market. In some markets, however, where short term supply has overtaken demand, long-term prices are competitive and can actually be better than spot prices.\n\n"}

A sting is usually a long shaft attaching to the downstream end of the model so that it does not much disturb the flow over the model. The rear end of a sting usually\nhas a conical fairing blending into the (wind tunnel) model support structure.\n\nFor minimum aerodynamic interference a sting should be as long as possible and have as small a diameter as possible, within the structural safety limits. Critical length of a sting (beyond which its influence on the flow around the model is small) is mostly dependent on Reynolds number. If the flow at the rear end of a model (model base) is laminar, the critical sting length can be as much as 12-15 base diameters. If the flow at model base is turbulent, critical sting length reduces to 3-5 model base diameters. Source also suggests a sting diameter of no more than about 30% of model base diameter. However, this may not be possible in wind tunnels with high dynamic pressures because large aerodynamic loads would cause unacceptably large deflections and/or stresses in the sting. Shorter stings of larger relative diameters must be used in such cases.\nA good rule-of-thumb is that, for acceptably low and test-conditions-independent aerodynamic interference in a high-Reynolds-number, high-dynamic-pressure wind tunnel, a sting should have a diameter \"d\" not larger than 30% to 50% of model base diameter \"D\" and should have a length \"L\" of at least three model base diameters, e.g. as specified for the AGARD-C calibration model), .\n\nIf the test object (model) is to be placed at high angles of attack relative to the airstream (i.e. at an attitude beyond the operating range of the model support mechanism), a bent sting can be used, . Bent stings usually produce higher aerodynamic interference than straight stings. If the test object (model) has a \"boattail\" rear end without a well-defined base through which a sting shaft can enter the model, a so-called Z-sting can be used, having a form reminiscent of the Latin letter \"Z\". The part of the sting entering the model is a thin aerodynamically shaped blade so as to minimize disturbance of the flow; .\n\nStings often attach, at the front end, to internal wind tunnel balances to measure the forces on the model. Therefore, most stings have a central bore through which the cables from a balance or other in-model instrumentation can be conducted without exposure to the airflow.\n\nWhen a model is mounted on a wind tunnel balance attached to a sting, care must be taken that no parts of the model touch the sting during a wind tunnel test; the only support of the model must be through the balance.\n\nWind tunnel\n\nReynolds number\n\n3. ^ Pastore, P.L., 1995.\nDesenvolvimento de uma Balança tipo Ferrão para Medições de Forças e Momentos Aerodinâmicos,Dissertação de mestrado,Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brasil."}

{"id": "2690282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2690282", "title": "Stone spheres of Costa Rica", "text": "Stone spheres of Costa Rica\n\nThe stone spheres (or stone balls) of Costa Rica are an assortment of over three hundred petrospheres in Costa Rica, located on the Diquís Delta and on Isla del Caño. Locally, they are known as Las Bolas (literally The Balls). The spheres are commonly attributed to the extinct Diquis culture and are sometimes referred to as the Diquís Spheres. They are the best-known stone sculptures of the Isthmo-Colombian area. They are thought to have been placed in lines along the approach to the houses of chiefs, but their exact significance remains uncertain.\n\nThe Palmar Sur Archeological Excavations are a series of excavations of a site located in the southern portion of Costa Rica, known as the Diquís Delta. The excavations have centered on a site known as \"Farm 6\", dating back to the Aguas Buenas Period (300–800 CE) and Chiriquí Period (800–1550 CE).\n\nIn June 2014, the Precolumbian Chiefdom Settlements with Stone Spheres of the Diquis was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe spheres range in size from a few centimetres to over in diameter, and weigh up to 15 tons. Most are sculpted from gabbro, the coarse-grained equivalent of basalt. There are a dozen or so made from shell-rich limestone, and another dozen made from a sandstone. They appear to have been made by hammering natural boulders with other rocks, then polishing with sand. The degree of finishing and precision of working varies considerably. The gabbro came from sites in the hills, several kilometres away from where the finished spheres are found, though some unfinished spheres remain in the hills. They are used for decoration.\n\nThe archaeological site of Palmar Sur is located in the southern portion of Costa Rica, known as the Diquís Delta, and in the southernmost part of the Puntarenas Province. The Diquís Delta is defined as the alluvial plain with the geographical boundaries of the Fila Grisera to the north and east, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Osa Mountains comprising the southern boundary.\n\nThe Site is located in Palmar Sur, southern Costa Rica. The site is located on approximately 10 hectares of property that was previously owned by the United Fruit Company in the alluvial plain of the Térraba River.\n\nThe archaeological site of Farm 6 has been dated to the Aguas Buenas Period (300–800 CE) and Chiriquí Period (800–1550 CE). It was a multifunctional site accommodating a settlement and a cemetery, and remains of monumental architecture and sculpture are also present on the site. The monumental architecture consists of two mounds which were constructed with retaining walls made of rounded river cobbles and filled with earth. The site contains multiple locations where large stone spheres are found \"in situ\". Additionally, since many of the stone spheres in the region were removed from their original locations and serve as landscape decoration, the site has become a storage location for spheres that have been returned to the National Museum. Also, there is a neighboring town to Farm 6 that also had spheres or \"esferas.\" They were called \"zanahoriagas,\" for their more oval-like shape.\n\nThe stones are believed to have been first created around the year 600, with most dating to after 1000 but before the Spanish conquest. The only method available for dating the carved stones is stratigraphy, but most stones are no longer in their original locations. The culture of the people who made them disappeared after the Spanish conquest.\n\nThe spheres were discovered in the 1930s as the United Fruit Company was clearing the jungle for banana plantations. Workmen pushed them aside with bulldozers and heavy equipment, damaging some spheres. Additionally, inspired by stories of hidden gold, workmen began to drill holes into the spheres and blow them open with sticks of dynamite. Several of the spheres were destroyed before authorities intervened. Some of the dynamited spheres have been reassembled and are currently on display at the National Museum of Costa Rica in San José.\n\nThe first scientific investigation of the spheres was undertaken shortly after their discovery by Doris Stone, a daughter of a United Fruit executive. These were published in 1943 in \"American Antiquity\", attracting the attention of Samuel Kirkland Lothrop of the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. In 1948, he and his wife attempted to excavate an unrelated archaeological site in the northern region of Costa Rica. The government had just disbanded its professional army, and the resulting civil unrest threatened the security of Lothrop's team. In San José he met Doris Stone, who directed the group toward the Diquís Delta region in the southwest (\"Valle de Diquís\" refers to the valley of the lower Río Grande de Térraba, including the Osa Canton towns of Puerto Cortés, Palmar Norte, and Sierpe) and provided them with valuable dig sites and personal contacts. Lothrop's findings were published in \"Archaeology of the Diquís Delta, Costa Rica 1963\".\n\nIn 2010, University of Kansas researcher John Hoopes visited the site of the Stone Spheres to evaluate their eligibility for protection as a Unesco World Heritage Site.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Companía Bananera de Costa Rica, a branch of the United Fruit Company, and banana plantations in the 1930s, vegetation in this area offered a great deal of biodiversity in both plant and animal resources. Resources available to Precolumbian inhabitants in this alluvial plain consisted of riverine and ocean resources, including mangrove forests located in the Terraba and Sierpe Rivers.\n\nThe rich alluvial soils of this region facilitated historical agriculture since the 1930s. The United Fruit Company dominated this southern region with banana plantations as early as the 1920s in Parrita and Quepos. The UFCO entered Palmar Sur in the 1930s under the name of Companía Bananera de Costa Rica in an effort to avoid antimonopoly legislature. Today the landscape is still carved into agricultural fields which are owned by co-ops and consist of plantain, banana, and palm plantations.\n\nScientific research in the alluvial plain, particularly on United Fruit Company properties, began in the 1940s with the work of Doris Zemurray Stone and Samuel Lothrop. Lothrop's work focused on excavation at a handful of sites, one being Farm 4. His work aimed to document all archaeological sites containing \"in situ\" stone spheres, to record the number of spheres and their dimensions, and to make detailed maps illustrating both their arrangement and alignments.\n\nAfter the work of Lothrop and Stone, research in the area took a hiatus for nearly fifty years. In the 1990s, Claude Baudez and a team of researchers set out to establish a ceramic chronology of the region by observing the change in ceramic styles over time. This was accomplished by examining the drainage ditches that were cut into the landscape by the UFCO. Research carried out by Ifigenia Quintanilla, under the direction of the MNCR from 1991–1996 was performed in the region under the project titled \"Man and Environment in Sierpe-Terraba\" focusing on settlement patterns, occupational sequences, and resources utilized in the region.\n\nFrancisco Corrales and Adrian Badilla, archaeologists with the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica, have performed continuous research in the region since 2002. Their research began in 2002 and focused on four archaeological sites in the region containing stone spheres and of which comprise a \"circuit\". These sites include Grijalba, Batambal, El Silencio, and \"Farm 6\". The purpose of the project was to assess the cultural significance of the sites, to protect the cultural heritage, in addition to beginning research and studies at the sites. Corrales and Badilla produced a booklet entitled \"El Paisaje Cultural del Delta del Diquís\" which provides a quick overview on the history of the Diquís Delta, the history of banana plantations and the UFCO, the natural environment, archaeological sites in the region, and the importance of the Diquís region as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Research has continued in the region by Corrales and Badilla focusing on the archaeology and the Precolumbian political structure in the Diquís Delta. Research emphasis was on chiefdoms and their associated archaeological indicators. Their objectives were to study the archaeological sites containing stone spheres in the Diquís Subregion to gain an understanding of community configuration, activity areas, sequences of occupation, and the recording of monumental architecture.\n\nResearch is currently ongoing at the \"Farm 6\" site under the direction of archaeologists at the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica. The first field season in which archaeological excavations were undertaken was in 2005. Objectives during this field season included defining the area in which two mounds were located, sphere alignments, and various excavations associated with mound 2. In 2007, as second field season was undertaken focusing on archaeological excavations of Mound 1. During this field season, a stone sphere was discovered \"in situ\" in association with the mound.\n\nArchaeo-tourism is a concept that is still relatively new in Costa Rica. To date, the national monument of Guayabo de Turrialba is primarily the only archaeological site open for tourism. Tourism on a smaller scale is occurring at the site of Farm 6 but is open to visitors upon paying a nominal fee to tour the museum display and then tour the grounds, viewing some of the discovery sites. It is no longer necessary to have an appointment. Future plans of the MNCR are to open the site to tourism on a larger scale and to include other sites nearby in the region.\n\nNumerous myths surround the stones, such as they came from Atlantis, or that they were made as such by nature. Some local legends state that the native inhabitants had access to a potion able to soften the rock. Limestone, for example, can be dissolved by acidic solutions obtained from plants. Research led by Joseph Davidovits of the Geopolymer Institute in France has been offered in support of this hypothesis. However, most of the spheres were created from gabbro, an acid-resistant igneous rock.\n\nIn the cosmogony of the Bribri, which is shared by the Cabecares and other American ancestral groups, the stone spheres are “Tara’s cannon balls”. Tara or Tlatchque, the god of thunder, used a giant blowpipe to shoot the balls at the Serkes, gods of winds and hurricanes, in order to drive them out of these lands.\n\nIt has been claimed that the spheres are perfect, or very near perfect in roundness, although some spheres are known to vary over in diameter. Also, the stones have been damaged and eroded over the years, and so it is impossible to know exactly their original shape. A review of the way that the stones were measured by Lothrop reveals that claims of precision are due to misinterpretations of the methods used in their measurement. Although Lothrop published tables of ball diameters with figures to three decimal places, these figures were actually averages of measurements taken with tapes that were nowhere near that precise.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38829", "title": "Three-phase electric power", "text": "Three-phase electric power\n\nThree-phase electric power is a common method of alternating current electric power generation, transmission, and distribution. It is a type of polyphase system and is the most common method used by electrical grids worldwide to transfer power. It is also used to power large motors and other heavy loads.\n\nA three-wire three-phase circuit is usually more economical than an equivalent two-wire single-phase circuit at the same line to ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit a given amount of electrical power.\nPolyphase power systems were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky, Jonas Wenström, John Hopkinson and Nikola Tesla in the late 1880s.\n\nIn a symmetric three-phase power supply system, three conductors each carry an alternating current of the same frequency and voltage amplitude relative to a common reference but with a phase difference of one third of a cycle between each. The common reference is usually connected to ground and often to a current-carrying conductor called the neutral. Due to the phase difference, the voltage on any conductor reaches its peak at one third of a cycle after one of the other conductors and one third of a cycle before the remaining conductor. This phase delay gives constant power transfer to a balanced linear load. It also makes it possible to produce a rotating magnetic field in an electric motor and generate other phase arrangements using transformers (for instance, a two phase system using a Scott-T transformer). The amplitude of the voltage difference between two phases is formula_1 times the amplitude of the voltage of the individual phases.\n\nThe symmetric three-phase systems described here are simply referred to as \"three-phase systems\" because, although it is possible to design and implement asymmetric three-phase power systems (i.e., with unequal voltages or phase shifts), they are not used in practice because they lack the most important advantages of symmetric systems.\n\nIn a three-phase system feeding a balanced and linear load, the sum of the instantaneous currents of the three conductors is zero. In other words, the current in each conductor is equal in magnitude to the sum of the currents in the other two, but with the opposite sign. The return path for the current in any phase conductor is the other two phase conductors.\n\nAs compared to a single-phase AC power supply that uses two conductors (phase and neutral), a three-phase supply with no neutral and the same phase-to-ground voltage and current capacity per phase can transmit three times as much power using just 1.5 times as many wires (i.e., three instead of two). Thus, the ratio of capacity to conductor material is doubled. The ratio of capacity to conductor material increases to 3:1 with an ungrounded three-phase and center-grounded single-phase system (or 2.25:1 if both employ grounds of the same gauge as the conductors).\n\nConstant power transfer and cancelling phase currents would in theory be possible with any number (greater than one) of phases, maintaining the capacity-to-conductor material ratio that is twice that of single-phase power. However, two-phase power results in a less smooth (pulsating) torque in a generator or motor (making smooth power transfer a challenge), and more than three phases complicates infrastructure unnecessarily.\n\nThree-phase systems may also have a fourth wire, particularly in low-voltage distribution. This is the neutral wire. The neutral allows three separate single-phase supplies to be provided at a constant voltage and is commonly used for supplying groups of domestic properties which are each single-phase loads. The connections are arranged so that, as far as possible in each group, equal power is drawn from each phase. Further up the distribution system, the currents are usually well balanced. Transformers may be wired in a way that they have a four-wire secondary but a three-wire primary while allowing unbalanced loads and the associated secondary-side neutral currents.\n\nThree-phase supplies have properties that make them very desirable in electric power distribution systems:\n\n\nMost household loads are single-phase. In North American residences, three-phase power might feed a multiple-unit apartment block, but the household loads are connected only as single phase. In lower-density areas, only a single phase might be used for distribution. Some high-power domestic appliances such as electric stoves and clothes dryers are powered by a split phase system at 240 volts or from two phases of a three phase system at 208 volts.\n\nWiring for the three phases is typically identified by color codes which vary by country. Connection of the phases in the right order is required to ensure the intended direction of rotation of three-phase motors. For example, pumps and fans may not work in reverse. Maintaining the identity of phases is required if there is any possibility two sources can be connected at the same time; a direct interconnection between two different phases is a short-circuit.\n\nAt the power station, an electrical generator converts mechanical power into a set of three AC electric currents, one from each coil (or winding) of the generator. The windings are arranged such that the currents vary sinusoidally at the same frequency but with the peaks and troughs of their wave forms offset to provide three complementary currents with a phase separation of one-third cycle (120° or radians). The generator frequency is typically 50 or 60 Hz, depending on the country.\n\nAt the power station, transformers change the voltage from generators to a level suitable for transmission in order to minimize losses.\n\nAfter further voltage conversions in the transmission network, the voltage is finally transformed to the standard utilization before power is supplied to customers.\n\nMost automotive alternators generate three-phase AC and rectify it to DC with a diode bridge.\n\nA \"delta\" connected transformer winding is connected between phases of a three-phase system. A \"wye\" transformer connects each winding from a phase wire to a common neutral point.\n\nA single three-phase transformer can be used, or three single-phase transformers.\n\nIn an \"open delta\" or \"V\" system, only two transformers are used. A closed delta made of three single-phase transformers can operate as an open delta if one of the transformers has failed or needs to be removed. In open delta, each transformer must carry current for its respective phases as well as current for the third phase, therefore capacity is reduced to 87%. With one of three transformers missing and the remaining two at 87% efficiency, the capacity is 58% ( of 87%).\n\nWhere a delta-fed system must be grounded for detection of stray current to ground or protection from surge voltages, a grounding transformer (usually a zigzag transformer) may be connected to allow ground fault currents to return from any phase to ground. Another variation is a \"corner grounded\" delta system, which is a closed delta that is grounded at one of the junctions of transformers.\n\nThere are two basic three-phase configurations: wye (Y) and delta (Δ). As shown in the diagram, a delta configuration requires only three wires for transmission but a wye (star) configuration may have a fourth wire. The fourth wire, if present, is provided as a neutral and is normally grounded. The \"3-wire\" and \"4-wire\" designations do not count the ground wire present above many transmission lines, which is solely for fault protection and does not carry current under normal use.\n\nA four-wire system with symmetrical voltages between phase and neutral is obtained when the neutral is connected to the \"common star point\" of all supply windings. In such a system, all three phases will have the same magnitude of voltage relative to the neutral. Other non-symmetrical systems have been used.\n\nThe four-wire wye system is used when a mixture of single-phase and three-phase loads are to be served, such as mixed lighting and motor loads. An example of application is local distribution in Europe (and elsewhere), where each customer may be only fed from one phase and the neutral (which is common to the three phases). When a group of customers sharing the neutral draw unequal phase currents, the common neutral wire carries the currents resulting from these imbalances. Electrical engineers try to design the three-phase power system for any one location so that the power drawn from each of three phases is the same, as far as possible at that site. Electrical engineers also try to arrange the distribution network so the loads are balanced as much as possible, since the same principles that apply to individual premises also apply to the wide-scale distribution system power. Hence, every effort is made by supply authorities to distribute the power drawn on each of the three phases over a large number of premises so that, on average, as nearly as possible a balanced load is seen at the point of supply.\n\nFor domestic use, some countries such as the UK may supply one phase and neutral at a high current (up to 100 A) to one property, while others such as Germany may supply 3 phases and neutral to each customer, but at a lower fuse rating, typically 40–63 A per phase, and \"rotated\" to avoid the effect that more load tends to be put on the first phase.\n\nIn North America, a high-leg delta supply is sometimes used where one winding of a delta-connected transformer feeding the load is center-tapped and that center tap is grounded and connected as a neutral as shown in the second diagram. This setup produces three different voltages: If the voltage between the center tap (neutral) and each of the top and bottom taps (phase and anti-phase) is 120 V (100%), the voltage across the phase and anti-phase lines is 240 V (200%), and the neutral to \"high leg\" voltage is ≈ 208 V (173%).\n\nThe reason for providing the delta connected supply is usually to power large motors requiring a rotating field. However, the premises concerned will also require the \"normal\" North American 120 V supplies, two of which are derived (180 degrees \"out of phase\") between the \"neutral\" and either of the center tapped phase points.\n\nIn the perfectly balanced case all three lines share equivalent loads. Examining the circuits we can derive relationships between line voltage and current, and load voltage and current for wye and delta connected loads.\n\nIn a balanced system each line will produce equal voltage magnitudes at phase angles equally spaced from each other. With V as our reference and V lagging V lagging V, using angle notation, and V the voltage between the line and the neutral we have:\n\nThese voltages feed into either a wye or delta connected load.\n\nThe voltage seen by the load will depend on the load connection; for the wye case, connecting each load to a phase (line-to-neutral) voltages gives:\n\nwhere \"Z\" is the sum of line and load impedances (\"Z\" = \"Z\" + \"Z\"), and \"θ\" is the phase of the total impedance (\"Z\").\n\nThe phase angle difference between voltage and current of each phase is not necessarily 0 and is dependent on the type of load impedance, \"Z\". Inductive and capacitive loads will cause current to either lag or lead the voltage. However, the relative phase angle between each pair of lines (1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1) will still be −120°.\n\nBy applying Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) to the neutral node, the three phase currents sum to the total current in the neutral line. In the balanced case:\n\nIn the delta circuit, loads are connected across the lines, and so loads see line-to-line voltages:\n\nformula_9\n\nFurther:\n\nwhere \"θ\" is the phase of delta impedance (\"Z\").\n\nRelative angles are preserved, so \"I\" lags \"I\" lags \"I\" by 120°. Calculating line currents by using KCL at each delta node gives:\n\nand similarly for each other line:\n\nwhere, again, \"θ\" is the phase of delta impedance (\"Z\").\n\nInspection of a phasor diagram, or conversion from phasor notation to complex notation, illuminates how the difference between two line-to-neutral voltages yields a line-to-line voltage that is greater by a factor of . As a delta configuration connects a load across phases of a transformer, it delivers the line-to-line voltage difference, which is times greater than the line-to-neutral voltage delivered to a load in the wye configuration. As the power transferred is V/Z, the impedance in the delta configuration must be 3 times what it would be in a wye configuration for the same power to be transferred.\n\nExcept in a high-leg delta system, single-phase loads may be connected across any two phases, or a load can be connected from phase to neutral. Distributing single-phase loads among the phases of a three-phase system balances the load and makes most economical use of conductors and transformers.\n\nIn a symmetrical three-phase four-wire, wye system, the three phase conductors have the same voltage to the system neutral. The voltage between line conductors is times the phase conductor to neutral voltage:\n\nThe currents returning from the customers' premises to the supply transformer all share the neutral wire. If the loads are evenly distributed on all three phases, the sum of the returning currents in the neutral wire is approximately zero. Any unbalanced phase loading on the secondary side of the transformer will use the transformer capacity inefficiently.\n\nIf the supply neutral is broken, phase-to-neutral voltage is no longer maintained. Phases with higher relative loading will experience reduced voltage, and phases with lower relative loading will experience elevated voltage, up to the phase-to-phase voltage.\n\nA high-leg delta provides phase-to-neutral relationship of , however, LN load is imposed on one phase. A transformer manufacturer's page suggests that LN loading not exceed 5% of transformer capacity.\n\nSince ≈ 1.73, defining as 100% gives . If was set as 100%, then .\n\nWhen the currents on the three live wires of a three-phase system are not equal or are not at an exact 120° phase angle, the power loss is greater than for a perfectly balanced system. The method of symmetrical components is used to analyze unbalanced systems.\n\nWith linear loads, the neutral only carries the current due to imbalance between the phases. Gas-discharge lamps and devices that utilize rectifier-capacitor front-end such as switch-mode power supplies, computers, office equipment and such produce third-order harmonics that are in-phase on all the supply phases. Consequently, such harmonic currents add in the neutral in a wye system (or in the grounded (zigzag) transformer in a delta system), which can cause the neutral current to exceed the phase current.\n\nAn important class of three-phase load is the electric motor. A three-phase induction motor has a simple design, inherently high starting torque and high efficiency. Such motors are applied in industry for many applications. A three-phase motor is more compact and less costly than a single-phase motor of the same voltage class and rating, and single-phase AC motors above 10 HP (7.5 kW) are uncommon. Three-phase motors also vibrate less and hence last longer than single-phase motors of the same power used under the same conditions.\n\nResistance heating loads such as electric boilers or space heating may be connected to three-phase systems. Electric lighting may also be similarly connected.\n\nLine frequency flicker in light is detrimental to high speed cameras used in sports event broadcasting for slow motion replays. It can be reduced by evenly spreading line frequency operated light sources across the three phases so that the illuminated area is lit from all three phases. This technique was applied successfully at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nRectifiers may use a three-phase source to produce a six-pulse DC output. The output of such rectifiers is much smoother than rectified single phase and, unlike single-phase, does not drop to zero between pulses. Such rectifiers may be used for battery charging, electrolysis processes such as aluminium production or for operation of DC motors. \"Zig-zag\" transformers may make the equivalent of six-phase full-wave rectification, twelve pulses per cycle, and this method is occasionally employed to reduce the cost of the filtering components, while improving the quality of the resulting DC.\nOne example of a three-phase load is the electric arc furnace used in steelmaking and in refining of ores.\n\nIn many European countries electric stoves are usually designed for a three-phase feed. Individual heating units are often connected between phase and neutral to allow for connection to a single-phase circuit if three-phase is not available. Other usual three-phase loads in the domestic field are tankless water heating systems and storage heaters. Homes in Europe and the UK have standardized on a nominal 230 V between any phase and ground. (Existing supplies remain near 240 V in the UK, and 220 V on much of the continent.) Most groups of houses are fed from a three-phase street transformer so that individual premises with above-average demand can be fed with a second or third phase connection.\n\nPhase converters are used when three-phase equipment needs to be operated on a single-phase power source. They are used when three-phase power is not available or cost is not justifiable. Such converters may also allow the frequency to be varied, allowing speed control. Some railway locomotives use a single-phase source to drive three-phase motors fed through an electronic drive.\n\nA rotary phase converter is a three-phase motor with special starting arrangements and power factor correction that produces balanced three-phase voltages. When properly designed, these rotary converters can allow satisfactory operation of a three-phase motor on a single-phase source. In such a device, the energy storage is performed by the inertia (flywheel effect) of the rotating components. An external flywheel is sometimes found on one or both ends of the shaft.\n\nA three-phase generator can be driven by a single-phase motor. This motor-generator combination can provide a frequency changer function as well as phase conversion, but requires two machines with all their expenses and losses. The motor-generator method can also form an uninterruptible power supply when used in conjunction with a large flywheel and a battery-powered DC motor; such a combination will deliver nearly constant power compared to the temporary frequency drop experienced with a standby generator set gives until the standby generator kicks in.\n\nCapacitors and autotransformers can be used to approximate a three-phase system in a static phase converter, but the voltage and phase angle of the additional phase may only be useful for certain loads. \n\nVariable-frequency drives and digital phase converters use power electronic devices to synthesize a balanced three-phase supply from single-phase input power.\n\n\nConductors of a three-phase system are usually identified by a color code, to allow for balanced loading and to assure the correct phase rotation for motors. Colors used may adhere to International Standard IEC 60446 (now merged into IEC 60445), older standards or to no standard at all and may vary even within a single installation. For example, in the U.S. and Canada, different color codes are used for grounded (earthed) and ungrounded systems.\n"}

{"id": "365856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365856", "title": "Wüstite", "text": "Wüstite\n\nWüstite (FeO) is a mineral form of iron(II) oxide found with meteorites and native iron. It has a gray color with a greenish tint in reflected light. Wüstite crystallizes in the isometric - hexoctahedral crystal system in opaque to translucent metallic grains. It has a Mohs hardness of 5 to 5.5 and a specific gravity of 5.88. Wüstite is a typical example of a non-stoichiometric compound.\n\nWüstite was named for Fritz Wüst (1860–1938), a German metallurgist and founding director of the \"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Eisenforschung\" (presently Max Planck Institute for Iron Research GmbH).\n\nIn addition to the type locality in Germany, it has been reported from Disko Island, Greenland; the Jharia coalfield, Jharkhand, India and as inclusions in diamonds in a number of kimberlite pipes. It also is reported from deep sea manganese nodules.\n\nIts presence indicates a highly reducing environment.\n\nWüstite, in geochemistry, defines a \"redox buffer\" of oxidation within rocks at which point the rock is so reduced that Fe,and thus hematite, is absent.\n\nAs the redox state of a rock is further reduced, magnetite is converted to wüstite. This occurs by conversion of the Fe ions in magnetite to Fe ions. An example reaction is presented below:\n\nThe formula for magnetite is more accurately written as <chem>FeO.Fe2O3</chem> than as FeO. Magnetite is one part FeO and one part FeO, rather than a solid solution of wüstite and hematite. The magnetite is termed a \"redox buffer\" because until all Fe magnetite is converted to Fe the oxide mineral assemblage of iron remains wüstite-magnetite, and furthermore the redox state of the rock remains at the same level of oxygen fugacity. This is similar to buffering in the H/OH acid-base system of water.\n\nOnce the Fe is consumed, then oxygen must be stripped from the system to further reduce it and wüstite is converted to native iron. The oxide mineral equilibrium assemblage of the rock becomes wüstite-magnetite-iron.\n\nIn nature, the only natural systems which are chemically reduced enough to even attain a wüstite-magnetite composition are rare, including carbonate-rich skarns, meteorites, fulgurites and lightning-affected rock, and perhaps the mantle where reduced carbon is present, exemplified by the presence of diamond and/or graphite.\n\nThe ratio of Fe to Fe within a rock determines, in part, the silicate mineral assemblage of the rock. Within a rock of a given chemical composition, iron enters minerals based on the bulk chemical composition and the mineral phases which are stable at that temperature and pressure. Iron may only enter minerals such as pyroxene and olivine if it is present as Fe; Fe cannot enter the lattice of fayalite olivine and thus for every two Fe ions, one Fe is used and one molecule of magnetite is created.\n\nIn chemically reduced rocks, magnetite may be absent due to the propensity of iron to enter olivine, and wüstite may only be present if there is an excess of iron above what can be used by silica. Thus, wüstite may only be found in silica-undersaturated compositions which are also heavily chemically reduced, satisfying both the need to remove all Fe and to maintain iron outside of silicate minerals.\n\nIn nature, carbonate rocks, potentially carbonatite, kimberlites, carbonate-bearing melilitic rocks and other rare alkaline rocks may satisfy these criteria. However, wüstite is not reported in most of these rocks in nature, potentially because the redox state necessary to drive magnetite to wüstite is so rare.\n\nAccording to Vagn Fabritius Buchwald, wustite was an important component during the Iron age to facilitate the process of forge welding. In ancient times, when blacksmithing was performed using a charcoal forge, the deep charcoal pit in which the steel or iron was placed provided a highly-reducing, virtually oxygen-free environment, producing a thin wustite layer on the metal. At the welding temperature, the iron becomes highly reactive with oxygen, and will spark and form thick layers of slag when exposed to the air, which makes welding the iron or steel nearly impossible. To solve this problem, ancient blacksmiths would toss small amounts of sand onto the white-hot metal. The silicon in the sand then reacts with the wustite to form fayalite, which melts just below the welding temperature. This produced an effective flux that shielded the metal from oxygen and helped extract oxides and impurities, leaving a pure surface that can weld readily. Although the ancients had no knowledge of how this worked, the ability to weld iron contributed to the movement out of the Bronze age and into the modern.\n\nWüstite forms a solid solution with periclase (MgO), and Fe substitutes for Mg. Periclase, when hydrated, forms brucite (Mg(OH)), a common product of serpentinite metamorphic reactions.\n\nOxidation of wüstite forms goethite-limonite.\n\nZinc, aluminium and other transition metals may substitute for Fe in wüstite.\n\nWüstite in dolomite skarns may be related to siderite (Fe-carbonate), wollastonite, enstatite, diopside and magnesite.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1765073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1765073", "title": "Zinc–air battery", "text": "Zinc–air battery\n\nZinc–air batteries (non-rechargeable; IEC codes: A, P), and zinc–air fuel cells (mechanically rechargeable) are metal-air batteries powered by oxidizing zinc with oxygen from the air. These batteries have high energy densities and are relatively inexpensive to produce. Sizes range from very small button cells for hearing aids, larger batteries used in film cameras that previously used mercury batteries, to very large batteries used for electric vehicle propulsion.\n\nDuring discharge, a mass of zinc particles forms a porous anode, which is saturated with an electrolyte. Oxygen from the air reacts at the cathode and forms hydroxyl ions which migrate into the zinc paste and form zincate (), releasing electrons to travel to the cathode. The zincate decays into zinc oxide and water returns to the electrolyte. The water and hydroxyl from the anode are recycled at the cathode, so the water is not consumed. The reactions produce a theoretical 1.65 volts, but this is reduced to 1.35–1.4 V in available cells.\n\nZinc–air batteries have some properties of fuel cells as well as batteries: the zinc is the fuel, the reaction rate can be controlled by varying the air flow, and oxidized zinc/electrolyte paste can be replaced with fresh paste.\n\nZinc-air batteries can be used to replace now discontinued 1.35 V mercury batteries (although with a significantly shorter operating life), which in the 1970s through 1980s were commonly used in photo cameras.\n\nPossible future applications of this battery include its deployment as an electric vehicle battery and as a utility-scale energy storage system.\n\nThe effect of oxygen was known early in the 19th century when wet-cell Leclanche batteries absorbed atmospheric oxygen into the carbon cathode current collector. In 1878, a porous platinized carbon air electrode was found to work as well as the manganese dioxide () of the Leclanche cell. Commercial products began to be made on this principle in 1932 when George W. Heise and Erwin A. Schumacher of the National Carbon Company built cells, treating the carbon electrodes with wax to prevent flooding. This type is still used for large zinc–air cells for navigation aids and rail transportation. However, the current capacity is low and the cells are bulky.\n\nLarge primary zinc–air cells such as the Thomas A. Edison Industries \"Carbonaire\" type were used for railway signaling, remote communication sites, and navigation buoys. These were long-duration, low-rate applications. Development in the 1970s of thin electrodes based on fuel-cell research allowed application to small button and prismatic primary cells for hearing aids, pagers, and medical devices, especially cardiac telemetry.\n\nThe first rechargeable zinc air batteries were manufactured in 1996 by a Slovenian innovator Miro Zorič. They were developed to power vehicles using the first AC-based drive trains, also developed by Mr. Zorič. The first vehicles on roads to use zinc air batteries were small and mid-sized buses in Singapore, where Mr. Zorič led the national electrification program at Singapore Polytechnic, during his technology transfer post. The mass production assembly line for his zinc air batteries was put in place in 1997. The cells offered much higher energy density and specific energy (and weight) ratio, compared to then standard lead acid batteries\n\nThe chemical equations for the zinc–air cell are:\n\nZinc–air batteries cannot be used in a sealed battery holder since some air must come in; the oxygen in 1 liter of air is required for every ampere-hour of capacity used.\n\nZinc-air batteries have higher energy density and specific energy (and weight) ratio than other types of battery because atmospheric air is one of the battery reactants. The air is not packaged with the battery, so that a cell can use more zinc in the anode than a cell that must also contain, for example, manganese dioxide. This increases capacity for a given weight or volume. As a specific example, a zinc–air battery of 11.6 mm diameter and height 5.4 mm from one manufacturer has a capacity of 620 mAh and weight 1.9 g; various silver oxide (SR44) and alkaline cells of the same size supply 150–200 mAh and weigh 2.3–2.4 g.\n\nZinc-air cells have long shelf life if sealed to keep air out; even miniature button cells can be stored for up to 3 years at room temperature with little capacity loss if their seal is not removed. Industrial cells stored in a dry state have an indefinite storage life.\n\nThe operating life of a zinc–air cell is a critical function of its interaction with its environment. The electrolyte loses water more rapidly in conditions of high temperature and low humidity. Because the potassium hydroxide electrolyte is deliquescent, in very humid conditions excess water accumulates in the cell, flooding the cathode and destroying its active properties. Potassium hydroxide also reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide; carbonate formation eventually reduces electrolyte conductivity. Miniature cells have high self-discharge once opened to air; the cell's capacity is intended to be used within a few weeks.\n\nBecause the cathode does not change properties during discharge, terminal voltage is quite stable until the cell approaches exhaustion.\n\nPower capacity is a function of several variables: cathode area, air availability, porosity, and the catalytic value of the cathode surface. Oxygen entry into the cell must be balanced against electrolyte water loss; cathode membranes are coated with (hydrophobic) Teflon material to limit water loss. Low humidity increases water loss; if enough water is lost the cell fails. Button cells have a limited current drain; for example an IEC PR44 cell has a capacity of 600 milliamp-hours (mAh) but a maximum current of only 22 milliamps (mA). Pulse load currents can be much higher since some oxygen remains in the cell between pulses.\n\nLow temperature reduces primary cell capacity but the effect is small for low drains. A cell may deliver 80% of its capacity if discharged over 300 hours at , but only 20% of capacity if discharged at a 50-hour rate at that temperature. Lower temperature also reduces cell voltage.\n\nLarge zinc–air batteries, with capacities up to 2,000 ampere–hours per cell, are used to power navigation instruments and marker lights, oceanographic experiments and railway signals.\n\nPrimary cells are made in button format to about 1 Ah. Prismatic shapes for portable devices are manufactured with capacities between 5 and 30 Ah. Hybrid cell cathodes include manganese dioxide to allow high peak currents.\n\nButton cells are highly effective, but it is difficult to extend the same construction to larger sizes due to air diffusion performance, heat dissipation, and leakage problems. Prismatic and cylindrical cell designs address these problems. Stacking prismatic cells requires air channels in the battery and may require a fan to force air through the stack.\n\nRechargeable zinc–air cells require zinc precipitation from the water-based electrolyte to be closely controlled. Challenges include dendrite formation, non-uniform zinc dissolution and limited solubility in electrolytes. Electrically reversing the reaction at a bi-functional air cathode, to liberate oxygen from discharge reaction products, is difficult; membranes tested to date have low overall efficiency. Charging voltage is much higher than discharge voltage, producing cycle energy efficiency as low as 50%. Providing charge and discharge functions by separate uni-functional cathodes, increases cell size, weight and complexity. A satisfactory electrically recharged system potentially offers low material cost and high specific energy. As of 2014, only one company has commercial units for sale, as described in a Dept. of Energy produced video at the ARPA-e Energy Innovation Summit in 2013. Fluidic Energy has apparently covered hundreds of thousands of outages in Asia at distributed critical load sites. And at least one firm claims to be in field tests for grid-scale backup applications.\n\nRechargeable systems may mechanically replace the anode and electrolyte, essentially operating as a refurbishable primary cell, or may use zinc powder or other methods to replenish the reactants. Mechanically recharged systems were investigated for military electronics uses in the 1960s because of the high energy density and easy recharging. However, primary lithium batteries offered higher discharge rates and easier handling.\n\nMechanical recharging systems have been researched for decades for use in electric vehicles. Some approaches use a large zinc–air battery to maintain charge on a high discharge–rate battery used for peak loads during acceleration. Zinc granules serve as the reactant. Vehicles recharge via exchanging used electrolyte and depleted zinc for fresh reactants at a service station.\n\nThe term zinc–air fuel cell usually refers to a zinc–air battery in which zinc metal is added and zinc oxide is removed continuously. Zinc electrolyte paste or pellets are pushed into a chamber, and waste zinc oxide is pumped into a waste tank or bladder inside the fuel tank. Fresh zinc paste or pellets are taken from the fuel tank. The zinc oxide waste is pumped out at a refueling station for recycling. Alternatively, this term may refer to an electrochemical system in which zinc is a co-reactant assisting the reformation of hydrocarbons at the anode of a fuel cell.\n\nCobalt oxide/carbon nanotube hybrid oxygen reduction catalyst and Nickel-iron layered double hydroxide oxygen evolution cathode catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity and durability in concentrated alkaline electrolytes than precious metal Platinum and Iridium catalysts. The resulting primary zinc-air battery showed peak power density of ~265 mW/cm, current density of ~200 mA/cm at 1 V and energy density >700 Wh/kg.\n\nRechargeable Zn-air batteries in a tri-electrode configuration exhibited an unprecedented small charge–discharge voltage polarization of ~0.70 V at 20 mA/cm, high reversibility and stability over long charge and discharge cycles.\n\nIn 2015, researchers announced a carbon-based, metal-free electrocatalyst that works efficiently in both reduction and oxygenation reactions. Organic compound aniline, polymerized into long chains in a phytic acid solution, was freeze-dried into a stable, mesoporous carbon aerogel with 2-50 nm pores, providing high surface area and room for the battery electrolyte to diffuse. The researchers pyrolized the aerogel to 1,000 degrees Celsius, turning the foam into a graphitic network, with many catalytic graphene edges. The aniline doped the foam with nitrogen, which enhances reduction. Phytic acid infuses the foam with phosphorus, helping oxygen evolution. The foam has a surface area of ∼1,663 m/gr. Primary batteries demonstrated an open-circuit potential of 1.48 V, a specific capacity of 735 mAh/gr (Zn) (energy density of 835 Wh/kg (Zn)), a peak power density of 55 mW/cm³ and stable operation for 240 h after mechanical recharging. Two-electrode rechargeable batteries cycled stably for 180 cycles at 2 mA/cm.\n\nMetallic zinc could be used as an alternative fuel for vehicles, either in a zinc–air battery or to generate hydrogen near the point of use. Zinc's characteristics have motivated considerable interest as an energy source for electric vehicles. Gulf General Atomic demonstrated a 20 kW vehicle battery. General Motors conducted tests in the 1970s. Neither project led to a commercial product.\n\nIn addition to liquid, pellets could be formed that are small enough to pump. Fuel cells using pellets would be able to quickly replace zinc-oxide with fresh zinc metal. The spent material can be recycled. The zinc–air cell is a primary cell (non-rechargeable); recycling is required to reclaim the zinc; much more energy is required to reclaim the zinc than is usable in a vehicle.\n\nOne advantage of utilizing zinc–air batteries for vehicle propulsion is that earth's supply of zinc metal is 100 times greater than that of lithium, per unit of battery energy. Current yearly global zinc production is sufficient to produce enough zinc-air batteries to power over one billion electric vehicles, whereas current lithium production is only sufficient to produce ten million lithium-ion powered vehicles. Approximately 35% of the world's supply, or 1.8 gigatons of zinc reserves are in the United States, whereas the U.S. holds only 0.38% of known lithium reserves.\n\nInitial rechargeable zinc air batteries, developed for use in vehicles, were used for buses in Singapore. Their developer, Miro Zorič, chose zinc air chemistry specifically due to zinc air battery production requiring only abundant raw materials without requiring rare earth materials. When used to power vehicular AC (induction) drive trains, this would allow global road transport electrification, without destabilizing global supply chains or cause adverse raw material bottlenecks.\n\nThe Eos Energy System battery is about half the size of a shipping container and provides 1 MWh of storage. Con Edison, National Grid, Enel and GDF SUEZ began testing the battery for grid storage. Con Edison and City University of New York are testing a zinc-based battery from Urban Electric Power as part of a New York State Energy Research and Development Authority program. Eos projects that the cost of storing electricity with such EOS batteries is US$160/kWh and that it will provide electricity cheaper than a new natural-gas peaking power station. Other battery technologies range from $400 to about $1,000 a kilowatt-hour.\n\nAttempts to address zinc–air's limitations include:\n\nZinc corrosion can produce potentially explosive hydrogen. Vent holes prevent pressure build-up within the cell. Manufacturers caution against hydrogen build-up in enclosed areas. A short-circuited cell gives relatively low current. Deep discharge below 0.5 V/cell may result in electrolyte leakage; little useful capacity exists below 0.9 V/cell.\n\nOlder designs used mercury amalgam amounting to about 1% of the weight of a button cell, to prevent zinc corrosion. Newer types have no added mercury. Zinc itself is relatively low in toxicity. Mercury-free designs require no special handling when discarded or recycled.\n\nIn United States waters, environmental regulations now require proper disposal of primary batteries removed from navigation aids. Formerly, discarded zinc–air primary batteries were dropped into the water around buoys, which allowed mercury to escape into the environment.\n\n\n"}
