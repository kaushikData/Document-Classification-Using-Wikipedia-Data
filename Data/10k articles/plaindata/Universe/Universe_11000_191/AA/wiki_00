By the time it reaches the Earth's surface, the spectrum is strongly confined between the far infrared and near ultraviolet.\n\nAtmospheric scattering plays a role in removing higher frequencies from direct sunlight and scattering it about the sky.\nThis is why the sky appears blue and the sun yellow — more of the higher-frequency blue light arrives at the observer via indirect scattered paths; and less blue light follows the direct path, giving the sun a yellow tinge.\nThe greater the distance in the atmosphere through which the sunlight travels, the greater this effect, which is why the sun looks orange or red at dawn and sundown when the sunlight is travelling very obliquely through the atmosphere — progressively more of the blues and greens are removed from the direct rays, giving an orange or red appearance to the sun; and the sky appears pink — because the blues and greens are scattered over such long paths that they are highly attenuated before arriving at the observer, resulting in characteristic pink skies at dawn and sunset.\n\nFor a path length formula_1 through the atmosphere, and solar radiation incident at angle formula_2 relative to the normal to the Earth's surface, the air mass coefficient is:\nwhere formula_3 is the zenith path length (i.e. normal to the Earth's surface) at sea level\nand formula_2 is the zenith angle in degrees.\n\nThe air mass number is thus dependent on the Sun's elevation path through the sky and therefore varies with time of day and with the passing seasons of the year, and with the latitude of the observer.\n\nThe above approximation overlooks the curvature of the Earth, and is reasonably accurate for values of formula_2 up to around 75°. A number of refinements have been proposed to more accurately model the path thickness towards the horizon, such as that proposed by Kasten and Young (1989):\nA more comprehensive list of such models is provided in the main article Airmass, for various atmospheric models and experimental data sets.\nAt sea level the air mass towards the horizon (formula_2 = 90°) is approximately 38.\n\nModelling the atmosphere as a simple spherical shell provides a reasonable approximation:\n\nwhere the radius of the Earth formula_7 = 6371 km, the effective height of the atmosphere formula_8 ≈ 9 km, and their ratio formula_9 ≈ 708.\n\nThese models are compared in the table below:\nThis implies that for these purposes the atmosphere can be considered to be effectively concentrated into around the bottom 9 km, i.e. essentially all the atmospheric effects are due to the atmospheric mass in the lower half of the Troposphere. This is a useful and simple model when considering the atmospheric effects on solar intensity.\n\nThe spectrum outside the atmosphere, approximated by the 5,800 K black body, is referred to as \"AM0\", meaning \"zero atmospheres\". Solar cells used for space power applications, like those on communications satellites are generally characterized using AM0.\n\nThe spectrum after travelling through the atmosphere to sea level with the sun directly overhead is referred to, by definition, as \"AM1\". This means \"one atmosphere\".\nAM1 (formula_2=0°) to AM1.1 (formula_2=25°) is a useful range for estimating performance of solar cells in equatorial and tropical regions.\n\nSolar panels do not generally operate under exactly one atmosphere's thickness: if the sun is at an angle to the Earth's surface the effective thickness will be greater. Many of the world's major population centres, and hence solar installations and industry, across Europe, China, Japan, the United States of America and elsewhere (including northern India, southern Africa and Australia) lie in temperate latitudes. An AM number representing the spectrum at mid-latitudes is therefore much more common.\n\n\"AM1.5\", 1.5 atmosphere thickness, corresponds to a solar zenith angle of formula_2=48.2°. While the summertime AM number for mid-latitudes during the middle parts of the day is less than 1.5, higher figures apply in the morning and evening and at other times of the year. Therefore, AM1.5 is useful to represent the overall yearly average for mid-latitudes. The specific value of 1.5 has been selected in the 1970s for standardization purposes, based on an analysis of solar irradiance data in the conterminous United States. Since then, the solar industry has been using AM1.5 for all standardized testing or rating of terrestrial solar cells or modules, including those used in concentrating systems. The latest AM1.5 standards pertaining to photovoltaic applications are the ASTM G-173 and IEC 60904, all derived from simulations obtained with the SMARTS code\n\nAM2 (formula_2=60°) to AM3 (formula_2=70°) is a useful range for estimating the overall average performance of solar cells installed at high latitudes such as in northern Europe.\nSimilarly AM2 to AM3 is useful to estimate wintertime performance in temperate latitudes, e.g. airmass coefficient is greater than 2 at all hours of the day in winter at latitudes as low as 37°.\n\nAM38 is generally regarded as being the airmass in the horizontal direction (formula_2=90°) at sea level.\nHowever, in practice there is a high degree of variability in the solar intensity received at angles close to the horizon as described in the next section Solar intensity.\n\nThe \"relative\" air mass is only a function of the sun's zenith angle, and therefore does not change with local elevation. Conversely, the \"absolute\" air mass, equal to the relative air mass multiplied by the local atmospheric pressure and divided by the standard (sea-level) pressure, decreases with elevation above sea level. For solar panels installed at high altitudes, e.g. in an Altiplano region, it is possible to use a lower absolute AM numbers than for the corresponding latitude at sea level: AM numbers less than 1 towards the equator, and correspondingly lower numbers than listed above for other latitudes. However, this approach is approximate and not recommended. It is best to simulate the actual spectrum based on the relative air mass (e.g., 1.5) and the \"actual\" atmospheric conditions for the specific elevation of the site under scrutiny.\n\nSolar intensity at the collector reduces with increasing airmass coefficient, but due to the complex and variable atmospheric factors involved, not in a simple or linear fashion.\nFor example, almost all high energy radiation is removed in the upper atmosphere (between AM0 and AM1) and so AM2 is not twice as bad as AM1.\nFurthermore, there is great variability in many of the factors contributing to atmospheric attenuation,\nsuch as water vapor, aerosols, photochemical smog and the effects of temperature inversions.\nDepending on level of pollution in the air, overall attenuation can change by up to ±70% towards the horizon, greatly affecting performance particularly towards the horizon where effects of the lower layers of atmosphere are amplified manyfold.\n\nOne approximate model for solar intensity versus airmass is given by:\n\nwhere solar intensity external to the Earth's atmosphere formula_16 = 1.353 kW/m, and the factor of 1.1 is derived assuming that the diffuse component is 10% of the direct component.\n\nThis formula fits comfortably within the mid-range of the expected pollution-based variability:\n\nThis illustrates that significant power is available at only a few degrees above the horizon. For example, when the sun is more than about 60° above the horizon (formula_2 <30°) the solar intensity is about 1000 W/m (from equation as shown in the above table), whereas when the sun is only 15° above the horizon (formula_2 =75°) the solar intensity is still about 600 W/m or 60% of its maximum level; and at only 5° above the horizon still 27% of the maximum.\n\nOne approximate model for intensity increase with altitude and accurate to a few kilometres above sea level is given by:\n\nwhere formula_19 is the solar collector's height above sea level in km and formula_20 is the airmass (from ) \"as if\" the collector was installed at sea level.\n\nAlternatively, given the significant practical variabilities involved, the homogeneous spherical model could be applied to estimate AM, using:\n\nwhere the normalized heights of the atmosphere and of the collector are respectively formula_9 ≈ 708 (as above) and formula_22 .\n\nAnd then the above table or the appropriate equation ( or or for average, polluted or clean air respectively) can be used to estimate intensity from AM in the normal way.\n\nThese approximations at and are suitable for use only to altitudes of a few kilometres above sea level, implying as they do reduction to AM0 performance levels at only around 6 and 9 km respectively.\nBy contrast much of the attenuation of the high energy components occurs in the ozone layer - at higher altitudes around 30 km.\nHence these approximations are suitable only for estimating the performance of ground-based collectors.\n\nSilicon solar cells are not very sensitive to the portions of the spectrum lost in the atmosphere. The resulting spectrum at the Earth's surface more closely matches the bandgap of silicon so silicon solar cells are more efficient at AM1 than AM0. This apparently counter-intuitive result arises simply because silicon cells can't make much use of the high energy radiation which the atmosphere filters out.\nAs illustrated below, even though the \"efficiency\" is lower at AM0 the \"total output power\" (P) for a typical solar cell is still highest at AM0.\nConversely, the shape of the spectrum does not significantly change with further increases in atmospheric thickness, and hence cell efficiency does not greatly change for AM numbers above 1.\n\nThis illustrates the more general point that given that solar energy is \"free\", and where available space is not a limitation, other factors such as total P and P/$ are often more important considerations than efficiency (P/P).\n"}

{"id": "140627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140627", "title": "Apatite", "text": "Apatite\n\nApatite is a group of phosphate minerals, usually referring to hydroxylapatite, fluorapatite and chlorapatite, with high concentrations of OH, F and Cl ions, respectively, in the crystal. The formula of the admixture of the three most common endmembers is written as Ca(PO)(OH,F,Cl), and the crystal unit cell formulae of the individual minerals are written as Ca(PO)(OH), Ca(PO)F and Ca(PO)Cl.\n\nThe mineral was named apatite by the German geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1786, although the specific mineral he had described was reclassified as fluorapatite in 1860 by the German mineralogist Karl Friedrich August Rammelsberg. Apatite is often mistaken for other minerals. This tendency is reflected in the mineral's name, which is derived from the Greek word απατείν (apatein), which means \"to deceive\" or \"to be misleading\".\n\nApatite is one of a few minerals produced and used by biological micro-environmental systems. Apatite is the defining mineral for 5 on the Mohs scale. Hydroxyapatite, also known as hydroxylapatite, is the major component of tooth enamel and bone mineral. A relatively rare form of apatite in which most of the OH groups are absent and containing many carbonate and acid phosphate substitutions is a large component of bone material.\n\nFluorapatite (or fluoroapatite) is more resistant to acid attack than is hydroxyapatite; in the mid-20th century, it was discovered that communities whose water supply naturally contained fluorine had lower rates of dental caries. Fluoridated water allows exchange in the teeth of fluoride ions for hydroxyl groups in apatite. Similarly, toothpaste typically contains a source of fluoride anions (e.g. sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate). Too much fluoride results in dental fluorosis and/or skeletal fluorosis.\n\nFission tracks in apatite are commonly used to determine the thermal histories of orogenic (mountain) belts and of sediments in sedimentary basins. (U-Th)/He dating of apatite is also well established from noble gas diffusion studies for use in determining thermal histories and other, less typical applications such as paleo-wildfire dating.\n\nPhosphorite is a phosphate-rich sedimentary rock, that contains between 18% and 40% PO. The apatite in phosphorite is present as cryptocrystalline masses referred to as \"collophane\".\n\nThe primary use of apatite is in the manufacture of fertilizer – it is a source of phosphorus. It is occasionally used as a gemstone. Green and blue varieties, in finely divided form, are pigments with excellent covering power.\n\nDuring digestion of apatite with sulfuric acid to make phosphoric acid, hydrogen fluoride is produced as a byproduct from any fluorapatite content. This byproduct is a minor industrial source of hydrofluoric acid.\n\nFluoro-chloro apatite forms the basis of the now obsolete Halophosphor fluorescent tube phosphor system. Dopant elements of manganese and antimony, at less than one mole-percent, in place of the calcium and phosphorus impart the fluorescence, and adjustment of the fluorine-to-chlorine ratio adjusts the shade of white produced. This system has been almost entirely replaced by the Tri-Phosphor system.\n\nIn the United States, apatite-derived fertilizers are used to supplement the nutrition of many agricultural crops by providing a valuable source of phosphate.\n\nApatites are also a proposed host material for storage of nuclear waste, along with other phosphates.\n\nApatite is infrequently used as a gemstone. Transparent stones of clean color have been faceted, and chatoyant specimens have been cabochon-cut. Chatoyant stones are known as \"cat's-eye apatite\", transparent green stones are known as \"asparagus stone\", and blue stones have been called \"moroxite\". If crystals of rutile have grown in the crystal of apatite, in the right light the cut stone displays a cat's-eye effect. Major sources for gem apatite are Brazil, Burma, and Mexico. Other sources include Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, and the United States.\n\nApatite is occasionally found to contain significant amounts of rare-earth elements and can be used as an ore for those metals. This is preferable to traditional rare-earth ores such as monazite, as apatite is not very radioactive and does not pose an environmental hazard in mine tailings.\nHowever, apatite often contains uranium and its equally radioactive decay-chain nuclides.\n\nApatite is an ore mineral at the Hoidas Lake rare-earth project.\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation in the crystalline state of hydroxyapatite, chlorapatite and a preliminary value for bromapatite, have been determined by reaction-solution calorimetry. Speculations on the existence of a possible fifth member of the calcium apatites family, iodoapatite, have been drawn from energetic considerations.\nStructural and thermodynamic properties of crystal hexagonal calcium apatites, Ca(PO)(X) (X= OH, F, Cl, Br), have been investigated using an all-atom Born-Huggins-Mayer potential by a molecular dynamics technique. The accuracy of the model at room temperature and atmospheric pressure was checked against crystal structural data, with maximum deviations of c. 4% for the haloapatites and 8% for hydroxyapatite. High-pressure simulation runs, in the range 0.5-75 kbar, were performed in order to estimate the isothermal compressibility coefficient of those compounds. The deformation of the compressed solids is always elastically anisotropic, with BrAp exhibiting a markedly different behavior from those displayed by HOAp and ClAp. High-pressure p-V data were fitted to the Parsafar-Mason equation of state with an accuracy better than 1%.\n\nThe monoclinic solid phases Ca(PO)(X) (X= OH, Cl) and the molten hydroxyapatite compound have also been studied by molecular dynamics.\n\nMoon rocks collected by astronauts during the Apollo program contain traces of apatite. Re-analysis of these samples in 2010 revealed water trapped in the mineral as hydroxyl, leading to estimates of water on the lunar surface at a rate of at least 64 parts per billion – 100 times greater than previous estimates – and as high as 5 parts per million. If the minimum amount of mineral-locked water was hypothetically converted to liquid, it would cover the Moon's surface in roughly one meter of water.\n\nThe ectomycorrhizal fungi \"Suillus granulatus\" and \"Paxillus involutus\" can release elements from apatite.\n\n"}

Apple still has yet to openly discuss any of its self-driving research, with around 5,000 employees disclosed on the project as of 2018. In May 2018, Apple reportedly partnered with Volkswagen to produce an autonomous employee shuttle van based on the T6 Transporter commercial vehicle platform. In August 2018, the BBC reported that Apple had 66 road-registered driverless cars, with 111 drivers registered to operate those cars. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reported on July 25, 2016 that Apple had hired Bob Mansfield to lead the Titan project.\n\nThe project was rumored to be approved by Apple CEO Tim Cook in late 2014 and assigned to Vice President Steve Zadesky, a former Ford engineer as project in-charge. For the project, Apple was rumored to have hired Johann Jungwirth, the former-president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, as well as at least one transmission engineer. \nBy February 2015, it was rumored that a substantial number of Apple employees were working on an electric car project, with Apple hiring new employees for the project as well. Reports in February 2015 indicated that the company had been offering incentives to Tesla employees to join Apple. In February 2015, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that the product would resemble more of a minivan than a car, and \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" said at that time that production could start as soon as 2020.\n\nIn February 2015, Apple board member Mickey Drexler stated that Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs had plans to design and build a car, and that discussions about the concept surfaced around the time that Tesla Motors debuted its first car in 2008. In November 2015, Former Apple iPod Senior VP Tony Fadell confirmed that Steve Jobs was interested in an Apple car back in 2008, shortly after the original iPhone was introduced. In May 2015, Apple investor Carl Icahn stated that he believed rumors that Apple would enter the automobile market in 2020, and that logically Apple would view this car as \"the ultimate mobile device\". \n\nIn August 2015, \"The Guardian\" reported that Apple were meeting with officials from GoMentum Station, a testing ground for connected and autonomous vehicles at the former Concord Naval Weapons Station in Concord, California. In September 2015, there were reports that Apple were meeting with self-driving car experts from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\" in September 2015, it will be a battery electric vehicle, initially lacking full autonomous driving capability, with a possible unveiling around 2019.\n\nIn October 2015, Tim Cook stated about the car industry that: \"It would seem like there will be massive change in that industry, massive change. You may not agree with that. That's what I think...\"We'll see what we do in the future. I do think that the industry is at an inflection point for massive change.\" Cook enumerated ways that the modern descendants of the Ford Model T would be shaken to the very chassis—the growing importance of software in the car of the future, the rise of autonomous vehicles, and the shift from an internal combustion engine to electrification.\n\nIn November 2015, various websites reported that suspected Apple front SixtyEight Research had attended an auto body conference in Europe. Also in November 2015, after unknown EV startup Faraday Future announced a $1 billion U.S. factory project, some speculated that it might actually be a front for Apple's secret car project. In late 2015, Apple contracted Torc Robotics to retrofit two Lexus SUVs with sensors in a project known internally as Baja.\n\nIn 2016, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk stated that Apple will probably make a compelling electric car: \"It's pretty hard to hide something if you hire over a thousand engineers to do it.\" In May 2016, there were reports indicating Apple was interested in electric car charging stations.\n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" reported on July 25, 2016 that Apple had convinced retired senior hardware engineering executive Bob Mansfield to return and take over the Titan project. A few days later, on July 29, \"Bloomberg Technology\" reported that Apple had hired Dan Dodge, the founder and former chief executive officer of QNX, BlackBerry Ltd.’s automotive software division. According to \"Bloomberg\", Dodge's hiring heralded a shift in emphasis at Apple's Project Titan, in which the company will give first priority to creating software for autonomous vehicles. However, the story said that Apple would continue to develop a vehicle of its own. On September 9, \"The New York Times\" reported dozens of layoffs in an effort to reboot, presumably from a team still numbering around 1,000.\n\nThe following week, reports surfaced that Magna International, a contract vehicle manufacturer, had a small team working at Apple's Sunnyvale lab.\n\nAfter a period of no new reports, car project news flared up again in mid-April, 2017, as word spread that Apple was permitted to test autonomous vehicles on California roads. In mid-June, Tim Cook in an interview with \"Bloomberg TV\" said Apple was \"focusing on autonomous systems\" but not necessarily leading to an actual Apple car product, leaving speculation about Apple's role in the convergence of three disruptive \"vectors of change\": autonomous systems, electric vehicles and ride-sharing services.\n\nIn mid-August, various sources reported that the car project was focusing on autonomous systems, now expected to test its technology in the real world using a company-operated inter-campus shuttle service between the main Infinite Loop campus in Cupertino and various Silicon Valley offices, including the new Apple Park. Then at the end of August, around 17 former Titan team members, braking and suspension engineers with Detroit experience, were hired by autonomous vehicle startup Zoox, described as \"a robotics company pioneering autonomous mobility as-a-service\".\n\nOct. 2016 reports claimed the Titan project has a 2017 deadline to determine its fate - prove its practicality and viability, set a final direction.\n\nIn November 2017, Apple employees Yin Zhou and Oncel Tuzel published a paper on VoxelNet, which uses a convolutional neural network to detect three dimensional objects using lidar.\n\nTransportation/tech website \"Jalopnik\" reported in late November that Apple was recruiting automotive test engineering and tech talent for autonomous systems work, and appeared to be surreptitiously leasing, via third parties, a former Fiat Chrysler proving grounds site in Surprise, Arizona (originally Wittman). Also in 2017, the \"New York Times\" suggested that Apple had stopped developing its own self-driving car. In response to such reports, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged publicly that year that the company was working on autonomous-car technology.\n\nIn January 2018, the company registered 27 self-driving vehicles with California's Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nIn May 2018, a \"New York Times\" article reported on major project news. After proposed partnership arrangements with Germany's high-end brands BMW and Mercedes-Benz failed, as did potential alliances with Nissan, BYD Auto, McLaren Automotive, and others, Apple reportedly partnered with Volkswagen to produce an autonomous employee shuttle van based on the T6 Transporter commercial vehicle platform. The T6 Transports would be transformed into autonomous electric versions at VW's Italdesign subsidiary in Turin, Italy, with the frame, wheels, and chassis remaining the same.\n\nWhile Apple does its best to keep its autonomous vehicles plans secret, regulatory filings do provide some factual insight into its activities. In September 2018, Apple was reportedly in third place in the number of California autonomous vehicle permits with 70, behind GM Cruze (175) and Alphabet's Waymo (88).\n\nOn July 7, 2018, a former Apple employee was arrested by the FBI for allegedly stealing trade secrets about Apple's self-driving car project. He was charged by federal prosecutors. The criminal complaint against the former employee revealed that at that time, Apple still had yet to openly discuss any of its self-driving research, with around 5,000 employees disclosed on the project.\n\nOn August 24 2018, it was reported that one of Apple's self-driving car had apparently been involved in a crash, when it was rear-ended during road-testing. The crash occurred while the car was at a stop, waiting to merge into traffic about 3.5 miles from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, with no reported injuries. At the time, the BBC reported that Apple had 66 road-registered driverless cars, with 111 drivers registered to operate those cars.\n\nIn August 2018, there were reports about an Apple patent that warned riders what moves an autonomous car would make before it made them, purportedly to alleviate nervousness.\n\n\n"}

According to the 2013 edition of Forbes Global 2000, canoils.com and any other list that emphasizes market capitalization and revenue when sizing up companies, as of March 31, 2014 these are the largest Canada-based oil and gas companies (they are either based entirely in Canada or majority Canadian owned). However more recent changes, possibly mergers or a stronger showing in the price of oil could mean a few of the oil sands producers are underrepresented; this is because Canadian companies are increasingly dependent on production from that source, which is hurt severely when oil prices decline below 50 to 60 dollars a barrel since costs per barrel traditionally exceed $28 and non-upgraded bitumen (<10 API) produces 1.7 fewer barrels per metric ton than West Texas Intermediate oil (according to calculation). A few of the larger companies (Penn West Petroleum and Athabasca Oil Corporation) don't show up in the Forbes list because its ranking system takes many different factors into account.\nSyncrude and Irving Oil are also leaders in the Canadian industry, with Syncrude being the top producer of oil sands crude and Irving Oil operating the largest oil refinery in the country. Also, based on the price paid for a 9% share in Syncrude Canada Ltd by Sinopec the company could be worth as much as US$50 billion. Canadian oil company profits quickly recovered from the financial crisis; In 2009 they were down 90% but in 2010 they reached $8.4 billion; Helping profits is the smaller price gap between West Texas Intermediate oil ($85/bbl) and Western Canadian heavy crude ($65/bbl) with the price of upgraded synthetic oil surpassing WTI when supply falls (before being upgraded to synthetic crude, heavier oil produces fewer barrels of oil per metric ton than lighter oil). The two largest (Suncor and CNRL) are 2 of the 11 most valuable Canadian companies (April 2013). 2,412 oil and gas companies are based in Calgary, Alberta alone. \n\nOngoing research and development involving extraction technology and processing methods are chipping away at many of the barriers to bitumen production. A number of Canadian oil companies have a lot of exposure to heavy oil through assets in Alberta, they stand to benefit when research into more efficient and cost effective solutions yields positive results (Petrobank has numerous patents related to extraction technology that at least one major engineering firm considers 17% more efficient than the widely used steam assisted gravity drainage). In the summer of 2010 a research team at Hokkaido University discovered a catalyst that significantly improves the efficiency while lowering costs related to the processing of bitumen. Major oil producers are showing renewed interest in new technologies, a direct result of both heightened interest in raising the proportion of the oil sands that can be recovered (10%, which means are at stake) and the growing value of licensing rights. That has resulted in a shift in focus over to patent producing research and development. Cenovus Energy has used its patents as a tool to negotiate deals.\n\nProfiled and ranked is every Canadian oil and gas company with a market cap ranking top 500 worldwide and the eight largest by revenue (Nexen made Forbes list but not the top 500 companies according to market capitalization but it had the highest revenue among all other petroleum companies according to this list, addax petroleum became part of Sinopec). Eight of the ten most profitable companies of the oil and gas sector operating in Canada are represented here (other two were Athabasca Oil Sands Corp and Heritage Oil). In 2011 Canadian Natural Resources overtook Suncor to become Canada's largest producer. Suncor produced 549,000 boe/d in 2012 only slightly higher than in 2011. Canadian Natural Resources produced at a gross rate of 655,000 boe/d up from 600,000 boe/d the year before.\n\nsource for market cap, source for profit.

It operates in Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Colorado, Wyoming, Texas and Louisiana and had the largest reserve base among Canadian producers as recently as 2007.\nAt the end of 2009 Encana created Cenovus Energy when it split its integrated oil and natural gas components.\nIn February 2012 Encana sold 40% of its 100% interest in the Cutbank Ridge Complex, a natural gas resource in NE British Columbia. The deal is worth $2.9 billion, in 2011 the company made $3.5 billion in deals. The deal came just after another one involving Petro China collapsed.\n\nRevenue 18.261 bn MV 23.648 bn \n\nHusky Energy was founded in Wyoming by Albertan Glenn Nielson who with 2 partners, bought 2 heavy oil refineries, and used them to establish the Husky Refining Co. in 1938. This was followed by major purchases of oil rich land and gas stations. In 1946 Nielson moved part of the company to Canada where Husky Oil Ltd. was created separate from the parent company. By the late 1970s the company's need for more funding eventually forced Nielson to sell all his stake in the company. Another Albertan, Bob Blair CEO of the pipeline company AGTL (later renamed Nova Corp.) took advantage of the situation gradually increasing his stake in the company until he owned a controlling interest. About a decade later Husky ran into financial problems that were solved when Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing started investing in the company leading to a buy out of Blair's interests in 1991. The 1988 acquisition of Centerra Energy Ltd. made Husky a top 10 Canadian oil company. After a turbulent couple decades, Husky reasserted itself as a major Canadian petroleum company in 2000 by purchasing Renaissance Energy Ltd. in a $3.02 billion deal.\n\nHusky Energy has proven petroleum reserves of and of natural gas. It owns approximately 500 filling stations in Canada as well as property and/or mineral rights to some 6.67 million acres (27,000 km²) in Western Canada.\n\nHusky's oil production was exactly the same in 2011 as it was in 2003 (312,500 boe/d).\n\nRevenue 15.539 bn MV 21.664 bn \nBegan as a pipeline company called interprovincial pipelines incorporated by Imperial Oil in the 1940s as a result of growth at the Leduc oil fields in Alberta exceeding the capacity of Alberta's refineries to process the oil. In 1950 its pipelines were operational and in 1953 it was a publicly traded company at stock exchanges in Toronto and Montreal. By the late 1950s its main pipeline was almost long handling about of oil per day in certain sections.\nIn the late 1960s refineries in the US and Canada demanded more oil be delivered from Canadian sources, and the solution deemed best by management, and government officials was to build a new line through Chicago. The access expansion gave the company to Chicago helped the company grow rapidly and by the early 1970s throughput reached of oil. By 1986 Imperial Oil's ownership of the company was down to 33% and through an exchange of shares Imperial Oil helped interprovincial acquire another oil company called Hiram Walker while subsequently changing its name to Interhome Energy Inc. Later it was renamed IPL Energy Inc. During the 1990s it acquired a number of other companies (consumers gas, altagas, interest in Chicap pipeline) which delivered natural gas as well but most of the company's business was still in crude oil. The new divisions gave the company greater access to Toronto, Quebec and New York. Its last name change made in 1998 was to Enbridge Inc. a combination of the words energy and bridge.\n\nCurrently Enbridge owns the world's longest oil pipeline system (delivers per day), owns Canada's largest natural gas distributing company, and has 1.9 million customers. It is also active in the alternative energy sector, having an interest in wind farms, waste heat recovery plants and photovoltaic projects the largest of which is the Sarnia Solar Project.\n\nRevenue comes from commodity sales (79%), gas distribution sales (6.9%), transportation and other services (14.0%).\n\nRevenue 13.621 bn MV 25.049 bn \nCenovus Energy Inc. is the former component of Encana that focused more on integrated oil than natural gas though natural gas continues to contribute about half of total production (exceeded oil (crude and synthetic combined) as recently as the end of 2009 however a steady fall in output combined with new oil sands production has reduced that).\n\nCenovus Energy owns a 50% interest in two major US refineries operated by Phillips_66, which can act as a natural hedge for the company as commodity prices fluctuate.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012 Talisman sold off some of its largest assets including 50% of British operations; that resulted in revenue loss ($8.347b in 2011 to $7.312b in 2012).\n\nOriginally BP Canada, Talisman Energy is a publicly traded Tsx 60 petroleum company that operates in Canada, USA, Columbia, Scotland, Peru, Algeria, Tunisia, UK, Norway, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia, and Qatar.\n\nRevenue 5.840 bn MV 11.986 bn \n\nIn February 2013 Nexen was taken over by Cnooc in a $15.1 billion deal. At the time, Nexen's 2.5 billion boe reserves would've ranked 8th among Canada's oil companies.\n\nWhen Nexen was created in 1971 it was a subsidiary of the American company Occidental Petroleum called Canadian Occidental Petroleum. After taking over a number of smaller companies in Canada while increasing their international holdings they became larger and more independent of their parent company that by then held only a minor stake. In 2001 the name was changed to nexen in recognition of that.\nIn 2012 the company profited $333 million on revenues of $6.7 billion which is down since 2008 (US $8–9 billion, market value of US $11.14 billion, and a profit of US $1.68 billion). On November 29, 2011 Nexen sold 40% of its Horn River, Cordova and Liard basins shale-gas assets in northeast B.C. to Inpex Corp and JGC Corp of Japanese for US$676 million.\nAt the Long Lake project oil is upgraded by a process known as steam assisted gravity drainage.\n\nOperates in Canada, Yemen, Colombia, West Africa and the UK (offshore).\nIn February 2011 the Usan offshore oil field began producing. It has a capacity of 180,000 barrels per day and Nexen holds a 20% interest in it.\n\n\n\nAddax Petroleum (Sinopec) was one of about 60 Canadian companies that made it onto the Forbes Global 2000 2009 list. It was acquired by sinopec of China in June 2009 for C$8.27 billion.\n\nThese companies have at least 2 billion dollars in market value (6 of them being near or over $10 billion, the rest are between four and seven billion with the exception of Petrobank, Sherritt and Laricina Energy).

This geologic process accounts for very significant changes in the biogenic materials that make up the carbonaceous sediment. During catagenesis, the temperature increases, the pressure increases, and both organic and inorganic constituents “adjust” their phase or form to compensate. The process of “lithification” begins during this stage. Generally speaking, a rise in temperature results in the volatization of unstable species or elements that are weakly attached to carbon atoms. Increased temperature and pressure also result in the cessation of biogenic processes. One way to express these changes is to look at the ratio of oxygen to carbon, or hydrogen to carbon as the sediment matures. In almost all cases, as biogenic material matures in a geologic environment, the volatile elements such as oxygen and hydrogen are significantly reduced, resulting in a reduction in the O/C and H/C ratios. A typical O/C ratio value for a fully matured, catagenesis stage carbon might be less than 0.1. This means that for every 100 carbon atoms there are less than 10 oxygen atoms. Similar reductions in the level of hydrogen are also apparent.\n\nThis chemical reaction is believed to be a time, temperature and pressure dependent process which creates liquid and/or gaseous hydrocarbon Hc from primary kerogen X and can be summarised using the formula:\n\nwhere X is the initial kerogen concentration and X(t) is the kerogen concentration at time t.\n\nIt is generally held that the dependence on pressure is negligible, such that the process of catagenesis can be given as a first-order differential equation:\n\nwhere X is the reactant (kerogen) and κ is the reaction rate constant which introduces the temperature-dependence via the Arrhenius equation.\n\nSeveral generally unrecognized but important controlling parameters of metamorphism have been suggested.\n\nA great deal of future research is required to isolate the parameters which are most significant for inducing the Catagenetic process. Future work in the field will involve the following: \n\nFor example, while it was once assumed that catagenetic processes were first-order reactions, some research has shown that this may not be the case.\n\n"}

Two scale insects produce the wax: \"Ceroplastes ceriferus\", common in China and India, and the related \"Ericerus pela\", found in China and Japan. These insects deposit their secretions on the branches of certain species of \"Ligustrum\" (privet) tree. The insects and their secretions are harvested and boiled with water to extract the raw wax. The insect bodies, which settle to the bottom, are used as food for swine.\n\nAccording to an article in a November 1932 magazine article in the journal \"Nature\" by Herbert Beardsley, \"...the male larvae of a white insect, about the size of a mosquito, built a cocoon of pure, shining wax. The tree that produces the white wax insect grows in the Chien-Chang Valley, and there, about march, one may see, on the limbs and branches, round, brown forms, which contain innumerable white insects. If they are allowed to remain where they are, they will eventually drop off in a dead mass, for the food is not right for them; but if they are transported to other kinds of plants, the females will lay their eggs, the larvae will thrive and the male larvae will construct their shining palaces, which yield a profit to the wax-farmers. So, late in March, the insects are tied up in a leaf of the wood oil tree, then placed in gourd like receptacles which are packed into two large bamboo baskets. Runners or porters lift the baskets on their shoulders, and, traveling entirely at night – for to submit the insects to the midday heat would cause the pupal stage to end too soon – traverse the rocky paths and lofty ascents of the Cze-Chuan Mountains to arrive finally at the farming districts. \nThe baskets of insects are distributed to the farmers, who proceed at once to place the creatures upon the food plant, which is generally a species of flowering ash about five or six feet high. They are tied to the branches in small bags made of leaves, and holes are punched in the bags with a blunt needle so the adults may find their way out. When first emerging, the insects creep rapidly up to the leaves of the food plant, where they nestle for nearly two weeks. After this they begin to scatter and crawl along the branches. \nAbout the first of June, the females begin to lay their eggs, and the wax cocoons are formed in August in time completely coating every branch and stem. By the first of September the whole tree is literally covered with layers of pure white wax a quarter of an inch thick. The farmers then scrape the branches, and prepare the wax of the market.\"\n\nChinese wax is used chiefly in the manufacture of polishes, sizes, and candles.\nCandles, temple images and other articles connected with ceremonial worship, and polish for furniture. It is also used for burnishing the back of Chinese hanging scrolls with a stone. \n\nIn China the wax has been employed medicinally. Taken internally, it has been used as a remedy for hoarseness, pain, worms, nervousness, and to aid the mending of broken bones. Externally, it has been used as an ointment for treatment of wounds.\n\nOther names for Chinese wax include:\n\nIn Japan the tree yielding it is called \"ibota\" and the wax \"ibotaro\". Among other uses, it is used to polish white clamshell go stones.\n"}
{"id": "53150313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53150313", "title": "Chrysler minivans (S)", "text": "Chrysler minivans (S)\n\nThe first-generation Chrysler minivans are a series of minivans produced and marketed by the Chrysler Corporation in North American and Europe from 1984 to 1990. Sold in both passenger and cargo configurations, the series is the first of six generations of Chrysler minivans. Launched ahead of chief competitors Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari and Ford Aerostar, the first-generation Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager effectively created the modern minivan segment in North America, with many later North American minivans adopting a similar body configuration. \n\nLaunched in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, the Chrysler minivans were produced in a single body style, with the extended-length Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager introduced in 1987. For 1990, the minivan was added to the Chrysler brand, adopting the Chrysler Town & Country nameplate. For export, Chrysler sold the Chrysler Voyager, competing against the Renault Espace (which began life as a Talbot, part of the former Chrysler Europe) \n\nThe development of what became the Chrysler minivans began life in the early 1970s, as both Ford Motor Company and the truck division of Dodge began separate projects on \"garageable vans\". Intended as a more powerful, safer-handling alternative to the Volkswagen Microbus, both companies sought to create vehicles capable as a second car. The Dodge project ended with the creation of a clay model; Ford would create the 1972 Ford Carousel protoype, based on the Ford Econoline. Supported by both Lee Iaccoca and Henry Ford II, the Carousel prototype did not reach production, facing internal opposition from other Ford executives. \n\nAt the end of 1977, development of Chrysler minivans restarted with four main goals, with a planned 1982 model year launch.\nAlthough both the front-wheel drive K-Cars and L-body (Omni/Horizon) were being considered as donor platforms, Chrysler also allowed consideration of rear-wheel drive. Ultimately, the L-body was ruled out, as it was considered too light-duty for either the size of the vehicle or its planned six-cylinder engine. \n\nIn 1978, both Lee Iacocca and Hal Sperlich were fired from Ford Motor Company, joining Chrysler Corporation. The same year, the truck engineering division of Dodge was merged within its car counterpart of Chrysler. During 1978, Chrysler began research across the United States, seeking what features customers desired in a potential minivan, finding agreement in its planned goals. Though potential customers found concept sketches \"ugly\", Chrysler still found a potential market of nearly 1 million vehicles per year, with Chrysler selling 215,000 of them. \n\nBy 1979, Chrysler chose front-wheel drive for the minivan project, codenamed \"T-115\". Though the van would share its transverse engine and transmission with the K-cars, it would be based on a separate body structure. Approved by Lee Iaccoca at the end of 1979, the T-115 project would cost $500 million to produce, funded as part of the $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees given to Chrysler. \n\nFrom their 1979 approval to their 1984 launch, the Chrysler S-chassis minivans would undergo several major redesigns. Originally intended to use 4 sedan-style doors (similar to a station wagon), Chrysler changed to two sliding doors, claiming better parking-lot access. The design was later changed to a single sliding door, as Chrysler wanted to market the van to commercial buyers; while engineers wanted to make the left-side door an option, the tooling complexity was claimed to be too expensive. During development, the configuration of the rear door was also contentious, with a liftgate winning out over a station wagon-style tailgate. On the exterior, in 1981, the side windows were redesigned to become flush with the body; while requiring a major redesign of components and tooling, the design change allowed for a reduction of wind noise and drag. To further reduce costs, a number of visible interior components were shared with the Dodge Aries/Plymouth Reliant, including the instrument panel, interior controls, radio, and various trim items.\n\nLaunched in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, Chrysler marketed the first-generation minivans as the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, along with the Mini Ram Van cargo van. While the Dodge Caravan nameplate was used for the first time, Plymouth had used the Voyager nameplate since 1974 on its version of the Dodge Sportsman full-size passenger van. \n\nInitially released in a single 112-inch wheelbase, Chrysler introduced a 119-inch wheelbase as part of a 1987 update, launching the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager. Starting in 1988, the Chrysler Voyager was exported to markets outside of the United States and Canada. For 1990, Chrysler began production of the Chrysler Town & Country, among the first luxury vehicles produced as a minivan. \n\nDesigned as an alternative to full-size station wagons, the standard-length Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager (two inches shorter and two inches wider than a K-car station wagon), presented nearly double the cargo space of a K-car station wagon with a 7-foot long cargo floor. Similar to the K-car station wagons, the minivans use a liftgate rear door (supported by gas struts), unlocked by key. \n\nSeveral seating configurations were offered, depending on trim level. The standard configuration of five-passenger seating in two rows was included with seven or eight-passenger seating in three rows; the back two seats were two-passenger and three-passenger bench seats (in the style of a larger van, these latched to the floor). The more popular two-passenger configuration was offered in several configurations, with low-back seats (as the minivan was technically a light truck), or high back seats with headrests; depending on trim level, seats could have vinyl, \"deluxe\" cloth or vinyl\", or \"luxury\" cloth/vinyl upholstery. Two styles of rear seats were offered. The three-passenger rear bench adjusted was adjustable for passenger legroom or cargo space; the seatback also folded down when not in use. In 1985, a five-passenger version was introduced with a fold-flat rear seat; called \"Convert-a-bed\", the option allowed the rear seat to fold backwards into a bed. \n\nTo lower production and development costs of the Chrysler minivans, the vehicles maintained a high degree of visible parts commonality with other Chrysler vehicles, sharing wheel covers, door handles, instrument panels, and other visible trim pieces with the Aries/Reliant and other Chrysler vehicles. As the design of the dashboard precluded a conventional glove box, Chrysler added a large storage drawer underneath the passenger seat (a feature retained in later generations of Chrysler minivans and the Chrysler PT Cruiser). \n\nAt their 1984 launch, as with the K-Cars, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were externally distinguished largely by their grilles. Both vehicles were fitted with four headlights, with the Caravan fitted with an eggcrate grille while the Voyager was fitted with a horizontally-oriented grille. In what would become a signature styling feature of 1980s Chrysler minivans, top-trim Caravans and Voyagers were both offered with simulated woodgrain as an option. \n\nIn following with many other Chrysler vehicles, for 1986, Chrysler minivans shifted from 4-lug to 5-lug wheels. To reduce high-speed wind noise, Chrysler added a bumper-mounted air dam as the design of the dashboard did not include a conventional glove box, Chrysler added a large storage drawer underneath the passenger seat (a feature retained in later generations of Chrysler minivans and the Chrysler PT Cruiser). \n\nThe 1987 model year saw a mid-cycle update to the S-platform minivans. Largely centered around the May 1987 introduction of the Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager, the update saw an update to the front fascia (and taillamps). To better differentiate the Caravan from the Voyager, the model lines received different grilles; all models except the Mini Ram Van (cargo van) were shifted to flush-lens composite headlamps. Fourteen inches longer in length than a standard-wheelbase Chrysler minivan, the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager was the largest minivan in North America in 1987. The first Chrysler minivans fitted with a V6 engine, the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager eventually became the two most popular configurations. With both rear seats removed, the \"Grand\" minivans offered 150 cubic feet of cargo room, 25 extra than a standard wheelbase Chrysler minivan. \n\nThe unpopular front bench seat ended production, along with the rare Convert-a-Bed option. Interior upholstery was upgraded on several trims, with base vinyl seats removed (and deluxe vinyl remaining as an option on SE trim); for the first time, leather seating was offered on LE/Grand LE trim.\n\nFor 1989, the minivans saw a minor update. To improve fit and finish, Chrysler redesigned the front and rear bumpers, with single-piece bumper covers, painted to match the color of the body. The early-1980s K-Car steering wheel was replaced by a 3-spoke design (though the rest of the dashboard remained unchanged). In addition to the standard trim levels, Chrysler added the top-line Dodge Caravan ES and Plymouth Voyager LX; as an early 1990 model, the Chrysler Town & Country luxury minivan was introduced in early 1989.\nThe first-generation Chrysler minivans are based upon the Chrysler S platform, using unibody construction. Contrary to popular belief, the S platform is not directly related to the K platform; though sharing powertrains to lower development and production costs, the S platform has a distinct body structure, allowing for a higher hoodline and seat height. The S platform is produced in two wheelbases: 112.1 inches for standard-length minivans; 119.1 inches for \"Grand\"-length minivans.\n\nAdapting the layout of the K platform for a larger vehicle, the S-platform vans were fitted with MacPherson strut front suspension and a beam rear axle with leaf springs. All S-platform minvans are fitted with front disc and rear drum brakes. \n\nFor the first three years of production, two engines were offered – both inline-4 engines with two barrel carburetors. The base 2.2L was borrowed from the Chrysler K-cars, and produced horsepower. The higher performance fuel-injected version of the 2.2L engine later offered in the K-cars was never offered in the Caravan, and the 2-bbl version would remain the base power plant until mid-1987. Alongside the 2.2L, an optional Mitsubishi 2.6L engine was available, producing horsepower.\n\nIn mid-1987, the base 2.2L I4 was replaced with a fuel-injected 2.5L I4, which produced a respectable , while the Mitsubishi \"G54B\" I4 was replaced with the new fuel-injected 3.0L Mitsubishi V-6 producing in March of that year.\n\nShortly thereafter in model year 1989, a more powerful engine became optional, with a turbocharged version of the base 2.5L producing . Revisions to the Mitsubishi V-6 upped its output to that same year, and in 1990 a new 3.3 L V-6 was added to the option list. The V6 engines became popular as sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled and it was dropped at the end of the year.\n\nNone of the V6 engines, nor the turbocharged 2.5L were available on the European Chrysler Voyager. The Chrysler Town & Country was only available with one engine option, the Mitsubishi 3.0L V6 until June 1989, when it was replaced by the newly introduced 3.3L V6.\n\n\nBoth a three-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission and a five-speed manual were available with most inline-4 engines, including the turbocharged 2.5 L (this was a rare combination). Manual transmissions were not available on 2.6L Mitsubishi 4-cylinder models, V6 models of the passenger Caravan, but were an option on the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V's long wheelbase models with a 3.0 L V6.\n\nV-6 engines were only offered with the venerable fully hydraulically operated TorqueFlite, until the computer controlled Ultradrive 4-speed automatic became available in 1989. The Ultradrive offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the inline-4 engine. However, it suffered from reliability problems, usually stemming from what is known as \"gear hunt\" or \"shift busyness\", resulting in premature wear of the internal clutches. It also required an uncommon type of automatic transmission fluid and is not clearly labeled as such, leading many owners to use the more common Dexron II rather than the specified \"Mopar ATF+3\", resulting in transmission damage and eventual failure.\n\nThe Ultradrive received numerous design changes in subsequent model years to improve reliability, and many early model transmissions would eventually be retrofitted or replaced with the updated versions by dealers, under warranty. These efforts were mostly successful, and most first-generation Caravans eventually got an updated transmission.\n\nThe S-platform Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were both offered in three trim levels, an unnamed base trim level, mid-range \"SE\", and top-range \"LE\"; LE-trim minivans were marketed with the option of simulated woodgrain paneling. In 1989, as part of a minor exterior update, Dodge and Plymouth each gained an additional trim level for the top of the model range, the Dodge Caravan ES and Plymouth Voyager LX, available only in standard-wheelbase configuration.\n\nChrysler produced two cargo van variants of the S platform, both based upon the Dodge Caravan. From 1984 to 1988, Dodge marketed the Mini Ram Van. Distinguished by a \"Ram\" nameplate under the side-view mirror, the Mini Ram Van was renamed the Caravan C/V (Cargo Van) for 1989. In contrast to passenger vans, the Caravan C/V was fitted with model-specific headlight clusters, using dual sealed-beam headlamps (shared with the export Chrysler Voyager). Several window configurations were available, ranging from either no windows to a full set of windows. Coinciding with the 1987 introduction of the Grand Caravan, cargo van production expanded to both wheelbases.\n\nOn the Caravan C/V, in addition to the liftgate rear door, Chrysler offered 50/50 split rear doors (similar to the Chevrolet Astro and traditional cargo vans). Produced as an option, the 50/50 doors were constructed of fiberglass; custom-installed by an outside vendor, the doors were installed between the factory and shipment to a dealer. \n\nAs with the larger Dodge Ram Van, the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V also served as a basis for conversion vans, sold through Chrysler dealers as well as through converters themselves.\n\nStarting for the 1988 model year, Chrysler began exports of minivans to Europe. As neither the Plymouth nor the Dodge brands were marketed outside of North America by Chrysler, minivans were exported under the Chrysler Voyager nameplate, competing against the Renault Espace and Volkswagen Transporter/Caravelle (sold as the Vanagon in North America). \n\nWhile the Voyager name was derived from the Plymouth division, the Chrysler Voyager was a rebranded version of the Dodge Caravan, fitted with the front fascia of the Caravan C/V cargo van. To accommodate the vehicle for European sale, the Chrysler Voyager was fitted with amber turn signal lenses (requiring new taillights), turn signal repeaters, and a model-specific license plate surround (adapted for European license plates and embossed with \"Chrysler\"). \n\nAlong with its rebranding, the Chrysler Voyager saw internal modifications, largely to comply with European safety and emissions regulations. With the exception of the turbocharged 2.5L engine and 3.3L V6, the Chrysler Voyager shared its powertrain with its North American counterpart; many examples were produced with manual transmissions. \n\nAfter being discontinued in the 1988 model year, the Chrysler Town & Country nameplate was revived as Chrysler released a minivan for its namesake division. Introduced in the spring of the 1989 as an early 1990 model, the Town & Country was released as the highest-trim version of the three Chrysler minivans, sold exclusively in the long-wheelbase body length. Originally slated for a 1989 release, the Town & Country was the first of the three minivans produced as a 1990 model. \n\nDesigned as a competitor to luxury-themed minivans such as the Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer and the (then-upcoming) Oldsmobile Silhouette, the Town & Country included nearly every feature of the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager as standard equipment, with a number of trim features of its own. All examples were produced with woodgrain trim (a feature associated with the nameplate). Initially, Bright White Clearcoat was the sole color available, with Black Clearcoat added as an option in June 1989 (as 1990 Caravans/Voyagers entered production). \n\nTo externally distinguish the Town & Country, Chrysler added a chrome waterfall grille (styled similar to the Chrysler New Yorker), clear-lens turn front turn signals, body-color mirrors, a crystal Pentastar hood ornament (shared with the New Yorker/Fifth Avenue), lower body trim (a monochromatic, long-wheelbase version of the Dodge Caravan ES body trim), and 15\" alloy wheels (later used with the Plymouth Voyager LX and other Plymouth models). The interior featured model-specific leather seating, leather interior trim panels, all available power-operated equipment, front and rear air conditioning, and an Infinity II sound system.\n\nDepending on production date, the 1990 Chrysler Town & Country was produced with one of two V6 engines. Prior to June 1989, it was fitted with a 142hp 3.0L Mitsubishi V6. From June 1989 onward, all examples were fitted with the 150hp Chrysler 3.3L V6. Although all S-platform Town & Country minivans have 1990 VINs, the EPA classifies examples with the 3.0L V6 as 1989 vehicles. Both engines were paired with the 4-speed Ultradrive automatic transmission. \n\nIn total, 5,404 examples of the Chrysler Town & Country were produced, making this variant the rarest of all Chrysler minivans. \n\nOriginal commercials for the 1984 Voyager featured magician Doug Henning as a spokesperson to promote the Voyager \"Magic Wagon's\" versatility, cargo space, low step-in height, passenger volume, and maneuverability. Later commercials in 1989 featured rock singer Tina Turner. Canadian commercials in 1990 featured pop singer Celine Dion.\n"}

It is a mixture of the two optically active isomers of 12(\"Z\") 9,10-epoxy-octadecenoic acid. This mixture is also termed 9,10-epoxy-12Z-octadecenoic acid or 9(10)-EpOME and when formed by or studied in mammalians, isoleukotoxin.\n\nCoronaric acid is found in the seed oils derived from plants in sunflower family such as (Helianthus annuus) and Xeranthemum annuum.\n\nCoronaric acid is also formed by the cells and tissues of various mammalian (including humans) species through the metabolism of linoleic acid by cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase enzymes. These CYPs (CYP2C9 and probably other CYPs that metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids to epoxides) metabolize linoleic acid to (+)12\"S\",13\"R\"-epoxy-9(\"Z\")-octadecaenoic acid and (-)12\"R\",13\"S\"-epoxy-9(\"Z\")-octadecaenoic acid, i.e. the (+) and (-) epoxy optical isomers of coronaric acid. When studied in this context, the optical isomer mixture is often termed isoleukotoxin. This same CYP epoxygenases concurrently attack linoleic acid at the carbon 9,10 rather than 12,13 double bond of linoleic acid to form a mixture of (+) and (-) epoxy optical isomers viz., 9\"S\",10\"R\"-epoxy-12(\"Z\")-octadecaenoic and 9\"R\",10\"S\"-epoxy-12(\"Z\")-octadecaenoic acids. This (+) and (-) optical mixture is often termed vernolic acid or when studied in plants and leukotoxin when studied in mammals.\n\nCoronoric acid is found in urine samples from healthy human subjects and increases 3- to 4-fold when these subjects are treated with a salt-loading diet.\n\nCoronaric and vernolic acids also form non-enzymatically when linoleic acid is exposed to oxygen and/or UV radiation as a result of the spontaneous process of autooxidation. This autoxidation complicates studies in that it is often difficult to determine if these epoxy fatty acids identified in linoleic acid-rich plant and mammalian tissues represent actual tissue contents or are artifacts formed during their isolation and detection.\n\nIn mammalian tissue, coronaric acid is metabolized to its two corresponding dihydroxy stereoisomers, 12\"S\",13\"R\"-dihydroxy-9(\"Z\")-octadecaenoic and 12\"R\",13\"S\"-dihydroxy-9(\"Z\")-octadecaenoic acids, by soluble epoxide hydrolase within minutes of its formation. The metabolism of coronaric acid to these two products, collectively termed isoleukotoxin diols, appears to be critical to coronaric acid's toxicity, i.e. the diols are the toxic metabolites of the non-toxic or far less toxic coronaric acid.\n\nAt very high concentrations, the linoleic acid-derived set of optical isomers, coronaric acid (i.e. isoleukotoxin), possesses activities similar to that of other structurally unrelated leukotoxins viz., It is toxic to leukocytes and other cell types and when injected into rodents produce multiple organ failure and respiratory distress. These effects appear due to its conversion to its dihydroxy counterparts, 9\"S\",10\"R\"- and 9\"R\",10\"S\"-dihydroxy-12(\"Z\")-octadecaenoic acids by soluble epoxide hydrolase. Some studies suggest but have not yet proven that isoleukotoxin, acting primarily if not exclusively through its dihydroxy counterparts, is responsible for or contribute to multiple organ failure, the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and certain other cataclysmic diseases in humans (see epoxygenase section on linoleic acid). Vernolic acid (i.e. leukotoxin) shares a similar metabolic fate in being converted by soluble epoxide hydrolase to its dihydroxide counterparts and toxic actions of these hydroxide counterparts.\n\nAt lower concentrations, isoleukotoxin and its dihydroxy counterparts can protect from the toxic actions cited above that occur at higher concentrations of isoleukotoxin and leukotoxin; they may also share with the epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatreienoates (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids), anti-hypertension activities.\n"}

{"id": "17917891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17917891", "title": "Durian", "text": "Durian\n\nThe durian () is the fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio. There are 30 recognised \"Durio\" species, at least nine of which produce edible fruit, with over 100 named varieties in Indonesia, 300 in Thailand and 100 in Malaysia. \"Durio zibethinus\" is the only species available in the international market: other species are sold in their local regions.\n\nRegarded by many people in Southeast Asia as the \"king of fruits\", the durian is distinctive for its large size, strong odour, and thorn-covered rind. The fruit can grow as large as long and in diameter, and it typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7 lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale yellow to red, depending on the species.\n\nSome people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance, whereas others find the aroma overpowering with an unpleasant odour. The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust, and has been described variously as rotten onions, turpentine, and raw sewage. The persistence of its odour, which may linger for several days, has led to the fruit's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in southeast Asia. By contrast, the nineteenth-century British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described its flesh as \"a rich custard highly flavoured with almonds\". The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and it is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet desserts in southeast Asian cuisines. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked.\n\nFirst used around 1580, the name \"durian\" is derived from the Malay language word \"duri\" (meaning \"thorn\"), a reference to the numerous prickly thorns\nof the rind, together with the noun-building suffix \"-an\".\n\n\"Durio sensu lato\" has 30 recognised species. \"Durio sensu stricto\" comprises 24 of these species. The 6 additional species included in \"Durio s.l.\" are now considered by some to comprise their own genus, \"Boschia\". \"Durio s.s.\" and \"Boschia\" have indistinguishable vegetative characteristics and many shared floral characteristics. The crucial difference between the two is that anther locules open by apical pores in \"Boschia\" and by longitudinal slits in \"Durio s.s.\" These two genera form a clade that is sister to another genus in the tribe Durioneae, \"Cullenia\". These three genera together form a clade that is characterised by highly modified (mono- and polythecate, as opposed to bithecate) anthers.\n\nThe genus \"Durio\" is placed by some taxonomists in the family Bombacaceae, or by others in a broadly defined Malvaceae that includes Bombacaceae, and by others in a smaller family of just seven genera Durionaceae.\n\n\"Durio\" is often included in Bombacaceae because of the presence of monothecate anthers, as opposed to the bithecate anthers common to the rest of the mallows (and angiosperms, in general). However, the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the tribe Durioneae should be placed in the subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors of these studies hypothesise that monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae).\n\nDurian trees are large, growing to in height depending on the species. The leaves are evergreen, elliptic to oblong and long. The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and directly on the trunk with each flower having a calyx (sepals) and five (rarely four or six) petals. Durian trees have one or two flowering and fruiting periods per year, although the timing varies depending on the species, cultivars, and localities. A typical durian tree can bear fruit after four or five years. The durian fruit can hang from any branch, and matures roughly three months after pollination. The fruit can grow up to long and in diameter, and typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7 lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow to red, depending on the species. Among the thirty known species of \"Durio\", nine of them have been identified as producing edible fruits: \"D. zibethinus\", \"D. dulcis\", \"D. grandiflorus\", \"D. graveolens\", \"D. kutejensis\", \"Durio lowianus\", \"D. macrantha\", \"D. oxleyanus\" and \"D. testudinarius\". There are many species for which the fruit has never been collected or properly examined, however, so other species with edible fruit may exist. The durian is somewhat similar in appearance to the jackfruit, an unrelated species.\n\nThe name \"durian\" comes from the Malay word \"duri\" (thorn) together with the suffix -\"an\" (for building a noun in Malay). \"D. zibethinus\" is the only species commercially cultivated on a large scale and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree phenology. In the species name, \"zibethinus\" refers to the Indian civet, \"Viverra zibetha\". There is disagreement over whether this name, bestowed by Linnaeus, refers to civets being so fond of the durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling like the civet.\n\nDurian flowers are large and feathery with copious nectar, and give off a heavy, sour, and buttery odour. These features are typical of flowers pollinated by certain species of bats that eat nectar and pollen. According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (\"Eonycteris spelaea\"); however, a 1996 study indicated two species, \"D. grandiflorus\" and \"D. oblongus\", were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and another species, \"D. kutejensis\", was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.\n\nSome scientists have hypothesised that the development of monothecate anthers and larger flowers (compared to those of the remaining genera in Durioneae) in the clade consisting of \"Durio, Boschia\", and \"Cullenia\" was in conjunction with a transition from beetle pollination to vertebrate pollination.\n\nOver the centuries, numerous durian cultivars, propagated by vegetative clones, have arisen in southeast Asia. They used to be grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but now are propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting, including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected rootstocks. Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as the shape of the spines. Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.\n\nMost cultivars have a common name and a code number starting with \"D\". For example, some popular clones are Sultan (D24), Kop (D99  – \"frog\" ), Chanee (D123,  – \"gibbon\" ), Berserah or Green Durian or Tuan Mek Hijau (D145  – Green Durian ), Kan Yao (D158,  – Long Stem ), Mon Thong (D159,  – Golden Pillow ), Kradum Thong ( – Golden Button ), and with no common name, D169. Each cultivar has a distinct taste and odour. More than 200 cultivars of \"D. zibethinus\" exist in Thailand.\n\nMon Thong is the most commercially sought after, for its thick, full-bodied creamy and mild sweet-tasting flesh with relatively moderate smell emitted and smaller seeds, while Chanee is the best in terms of its resistance to infection by \"Phytophthora palmivora\". Kan Yao is somewhat less common, but prized for its longer window of time when it is both sweet and odourless at the same time. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, five are currently in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Mon Thong, Kan Yao, Ruang, and Kradum. Since the 1920s, there have been more than 100 registered cultivars in Malaysia, and by 1992 there were up to 193; many superior cultivars have been identified through competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture, and Agrotourism Show. In Vietnam, the cultivar, Musang King, is a common variety preferred by consumers.\n\nBy 2007, Thai government scientist Songpol Somsri had crossbred more than ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No. 1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour. Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour about three days after the fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies consumers who prefer the pungent odour. On 22 May 2012, two other cultivars from Thailand that also lack the usual odour, Long Laplae and Lin Laplae, were presented to the public by Yothin Samutkhiri, governor of Uttaradit Province from where these cultivars were developed locally, while he announced the dates for the annual durian fair of Laplae District, and the name given to each cultivar.\n\nPopular cultivars in Malaysia and Singapore (Singapore imports most of its durians from Malaysia, hence the varieties are similar although there may be slight variation in the names) include \"D24\", which is a popular variety known for its bittersweet taste; \"XO\", which has a pale colour, thick flesh with a tinge of alcoholic fermentation; \"Chook Kiok\" (Cantonese meaning: bamboo leg) which has a distinctive yellowish core in the inner stem; and \"Musang King\" ('musang' is the Malay word for palm civet) which is usually the priciest of all cultivars. Musang King is known for its bright yellow flesh and is like a more potent or enhanced version of the D24.\n\nThe durian is native to Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia, and is cultivated in other areas with a similar climate. It is strictly tropical and stops growing when mean daily temperatures drop below .\nThere is some debate as to whether the durian is native to the Philippines or was introduced, particularly the Davao region on the island of Mindanao.\n\nThe centre of ecological diversity for durians is the island of Borneo, where the fruits of the edible species of \"Durio\" including \"D. zibethinus\", \"D. dulcis\", \"D. graveolens\", \"D. kutejensis\", \"D. oxleyanus\", and \"D. testudinarius\" are sold in local markets.\n\n\"D. zibethinus\" is not grown in Brunei because consumers there prefer other species such as \"D. graveolens\", \"D. kutejensis\", and \"D. oxleyanus\". These species are commonly distributed in Brunei, and together with other species like \"D. testudinarius\" and \"D. dulcis\" constitute a genetically diverse crop source.\nAlthough the durian is not native to Thailand, Thailand is ranked the world's number one exporter of durian, producing around 700,000 tonnes of durian per year, 400,000 tonnes of which are exported to China and Hong Kong. Malaysia and Indonesia follow, both producing about 265,000 tonnes each. Of this, Malaysia exported 35,000 tonnes in 1999. Chantaburi in Thailand holds the World Durian Festival in early May each year. This single province is responsible for half of the durian production of Thailand. In the Philippines, the centre of durian production is the Davao Region. The Kadayawan Festival is an annual celebration featuring the durian in Davao City.\nDurian was introduced into Australia in the early 1960s and clonal material was first introduced in 1975. Over thirty clones of \"D. zibethinus\" and six other \"Durio\" species have been subsequently introduced into Australia. China is the major importer, purchasing 65,000 tonnes in 1999, followed by Singapore with 40,000 tonnes and Taiwan with 5,000 tonnes. In the same year, the United States imported 2,000 tonnes, mostly frozen, and the European Community imported 500 tonnes. Due to the increasing popularity of durian in China, the price had risen up to 20 times over in four years, in a market that was worth nearly £400m in 2018. Malaysia negotiated a deal with China to export the whole fruit frozen for the first time to China starting in 2019, previously only Thailand was permitted to export the whole fruit to China.\nThe durian is a seasonal fruit, unlike some other non-seasonal tropical fruits such as the papaya which are available throughout the year. In peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, the season for durians is typically from June to August, coinciding with that of the mangosteen.\n\nPrices of durians are relatively high, compared with other fruits. For example, in Singapore the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24 (\"Sultan\"), and Musang King (\"Mao Shan Wang\") has resulted in typical retail prices of between S$8 to S$15 (US$5 to US$10) per kilogram of whole fruit in 2007. With an average weight of about , a durian fruit would therefore cost about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15). The drive for the prices increase was due to its popularity in China, which drove The edible portion of the fruit, known as the aril and usually referred to as the \"flesh\" or \"pulp\", only accounts for about 15–30% of the mass of the entire fruit. The increasing popularity of the fruit also saw the price of the Malaysian variety Musang King rise considerably; durian farmers would see the prices they get increasing from two ringgit per kilogram to 60 ringgit per kilo by 2018, which made it a far more lucrative than palm oil or rubber, leading to an increase in durian plantation. Many consumers in Singapore are nevertheless quite willing to spend up to around S$75 (US$50) on a single purchase of about half a dozen of the favoured fruit to be shared by family members.\n\nIn-season durians can be found in mainstream Japanese supermarkets, while in the West they are sold mainly by Asian markets.\n\nThe unusual flavour and odour of the fruit have prompted many people to express diverse and passionate views ranging from deep appreciation to intense disgust. Writing in 1856, the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace provided a much-quoted description of the flavour of the durian:\n\nWallace described himself as being at first reluctant to try it because of the aroma, \"but in Borneo I found a ripe fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at once became a confirmed Durian eater\". He cited one traveller from 1599: \"it is of such an excellent taste that it surpasses in flavour all other fruits of the world, according to those who have tasted it.\" He cites another writer: \"To those not used to it, it seems at first to smell like rotten onions, but immediately after they have tasted it they prefer it to all other food. The natives give it honourable titles, exalt it, and make verses on it.\" Despite having tried many foods that are arguably more eccentric, Andrew Zimmern, host of Bizarre Foods, was unable to finish a durian upon sampling it, due to his intolerance of its strong taste.\n\nWhile Wallace cautions that \"the smell of the ripe fruit is certainly at first disagreeable\", later descriptions by Westerners are more graphic in detail. Novelist Anthony Burgess writes that eating durian is \"like eating sweet raspberry blancmange in the lavatory\". Travel and food writer Richard Sterling says:\n\nOther comparisons have been made with the civet, sewage, stale vomit, skunk spray and used surgical swabs.\nThe wide range of descriptions for the odour of durian may have a great deal to do with the variability of durian odour itself. Durians from different species or clones can have significantly different aromas; for example, red durian (\"D. dulcis\") has a deep caramel flavour with a turpentine odour while red-fleshed durian (\"D. graveolens\") emits a fragrance of roasted almonds. Among the varieties of \"D. zibethinus\", Thai varieties are sweeter in flavour and less odorous than Malay ones. The degree of ripeness has an effect on the flavour as well.\n\nScientific analyses of the composition of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.\n\nThis strong odour can be detected half a mile away by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a variety of animals, including squirrels, mouse deer, pigs, sun bear, orangutan, elephants, and even carnivorous tigers. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as a result. The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.\n\nAccording to \"Larousse Gastronomique\", the durian fruit is ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of ripeness to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of \"D. zibethinus\" are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.\n\nThe various preferences regarding ripeness among consumers make it hard to issue general statements about choosing a \"good\" durian. A durian that falls off the tree continues to ripen for two to four days, but after five or six days most would consider it overripe and unpalatable, although some Thais proceed from that point to cook it with palm sugar, creating a dessert called durian (or thurian) guan.\n\nDurian fruit is used to flavour a wide variety of sweet edibles such as traditional Malay candy, \"ice kacang\", \"dodol\", \"lempuk\", rose biscuits, ice cream, milkshakes, mooncakes, Yule logs, and cappuccino. \"Es durian\" (durian ice cream) is a popular dessert in Indonesia, sold at street side stall in Indonesian cities, especially in Java. \"Pulut Durian\" or \"ketan durian\" is glutinous rice steamed with coconut milk and served with ripened durian. In Sabah, red durian is fried with onions and chilli and served as a side dish. Red-fleshed durian is traditionally added to \"sayur\", an Indonesian soup made from freshwater fish. \"Ikan brengkes tempoyak\" is fish cooked in a durian-based sauce, traditional in Sumatra. Dried durian flesh can be made into kripik durian (durian chips).\n\n\"Tempoyak\" refers to fermented durian, usually made from lower quality durian unsuitable for direct consumption. Tempoyak can be eaten either cooked or uncooked, is normally eaten with rice, and can also be used for making curry. Sambal Tempoyak is a Sumatran dish made from the fermented durian fruit, coconut milk, and a collection of spicy ingredients known as sambal. In Palembang, \"Pangasius\" catfish can be either cooked as \"tempoyak ikan patin\" (fish in tempoyak curry) or as \"brengkes (pepes) tempoyak\", which is a steamed fermented durian paste in banana leaf container.\n\nIn Thailand, durian is often eaten fresh with sweet sticky rice, and blocks of durian paste are sold in the markets, though much of the paste is adulterated with pumpkin. Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called \"boder\". The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in coconut oil, with a texture that is similar to taro or yam, but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. Uncooked durian seeds are potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested.\n\nYoung leaves and shoots of the durian are occasionally cooked as greens. Sometimes the ash of the burned rind is added to special cakes. The petals of durian flowers are eaten in the North Sumatra province of Indonesia, while in the Moluccas islands the husk of the durian fruit is used as fuel to smoke fish. The nectar and pollen of the durian flower that honeybees collect is an important honey source, but the characteristics of the honey are unknown.\n\nRaw durian is composed of 65% water, 27% carbohydrates (including 4% dietary fibre), 5% fat and 1% protein. In 100 grams, raw or fresh frozen durian provides 33% of the Daily Value (DV) of thiamine and moderate content of other B vitamins, vitamin C, and the dietary mineral manganese (15–24% DV, table).\n\nOrigin of the durian is thought to be in the region of Borneo and Sumatra, grows wild in the Malay peninsula, and was commonly cultivated in a wide region from India to New Guinea. Four hundred years ago, it was traded across present-day Myanmar, and was actively cultivated especially in Thailand and South Vietnam.\n\nThe earliest known European reference to the durian is the record of Niccolò Da Conti, who travelled to south-eastern Asia in the 15th century. Translated from the Latin in which Poggio Bracciolini recorded Da Conti's travels: \"They [people of Sumatra] have a green fruit which they call durian, as big as a watermelon. Inside there are five things like elongated oranges, and resembling thick butter, with a combination of flavours.\" The Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta described durians in \"Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India\" published in 1563. In 1741, \"Herbarium Amboinense\" by the German botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius was published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century. The genus \"Durio\" has a complex taxonomy that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius. During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the soursop (\"Annona muricata\"), for both of these species had thorny green fruit. The Malay name for the soursop is \"durian Belanda\", meaning \"Dutch durian\". In the 18th century, Johann Anton Weinmann considered the durian to belong to Castaneae as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.\n\"D. zibethinus\" was introduced into Ceylon by the Portuguese in the 16th century and was reintroduced many times later. It has been planted in the Americas but confined to botanical gardens. The first seedlings were sent from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to Auguste Saint-Arroman of Dominica in 1884.\n\nIn south-eastern Asia, the durian has been cultivated for centuries at the village level, probably since the late 18th century, and commercially since the mid-20th century. In \"My Tropic Isle\", Australian author and naturalist Edmund James Banfield tells how, in the early 20th century, a friend in Singapore sent him a durian seed, which he planted and cared for on his tropical island off the north coast of Queensland.\n\nIn 1949, the British botanist E. J. H. Corner published \"The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree\". His theory was that endozoochory (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of seed dispersal, and that primitive ancestors of \"Durio\" species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red durian (\"D. dulcis\") exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which \"Durio\" and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others don't. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the domestic and international demand for durian in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region has increased significantly, partly due to the increasing affluence of Asia.\n\nA common local belief is that the durian is harmful when eaten with coffee or alcoholic beverages. The latter belief can be traced back at least to the 18th century when Rumphius stated that one should not drink alcohol after eating durians as it will cause indigestion and bad breath. In 1929, J. D. Gimlette wrote in his \"Malay Poisons and Charm Cures\" that the durian fruit must not be eaten with brandy. In 1981, J. R. Croft wrote in his \"Bombacaceae: In Handbooks of the Flora of Papua New Guinea\" that \"a feeling of morbidity\" often follows the consumption of alcohol too soon after eating durian. Several medical investigations on the validity of this belief have been conducted with varying conclusions, though a study by the University of Tsukuba finds the fruit's high sulphur content inhibits the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase, causing a 70% reduction of the ability to clear toxins from the body.\n\nThe durian is commonly known as the \"King of the Fruits\", a label that can be attributed to its formidable look and overpowering odour. In its native south-eastern Asia, the durian is an everyday food and portrayed in the local media in accordance with the cultural perception it has in the region. The durian symbolised the subjective nature of ugliness and beauty in Hong Kong director Fruit Chan's 2000 film \"Durian Durian\" (榴槤飄飄, \"lau lin piu piu\"), and was a nickname for the reckless but lovable protagonist of the eponymous Singaporean TV comedy \"Durian King\" played by Adrian Pang. Likewise, the oddly shaped Esplanade building in Singapore (Theatres on the Bay) is often called \"The Durian\" by locals, and \"The Big Durian\" is the nickname of Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\nA durian falling on a person's head can cause serious injuries because it is heavy, armed with sharp thorns, and can fall from a significant height. Wearing a hardhat is recommended when collecting the fruit. Alfred Russel Wallace writes that death rarely ensues from it, because the copious effusion of blood prevents the inflammation which might otherwise take place. A common saying is that a durian has eyes and can see where it is falling because the fruit allegedly never falls during daylight hours when people may be hurt which is untrue as people have died from durian falling on their heads especially young children. A saying in Indonesian, \"ketiban durian runtuh\", which translates to \"getting a durian avalanche\", is the equivalent of the English phrase \"windfall gain\". Nevertheless, signs warning people not to linger under durian trees are found in Indonesia. Strong nylon or woven rope nettings are often strung between durian trees in orchards, serving a threefold purpose: the nets aid in the collection of the mature fruits, deter ground-level scavengers, and most importantly, prevent the durians from falling onto people.\n\nA naturally spineless variety of durian growing wild in Davao, Philippines, was discovered in the 1960s; fruits borne from these seeds also lacked spines. Since the bases of the scales develop into spines as the fruit matures, sometimes spineless durians are produced artificially by scraping scales off immature fruits. In Malaysia, a spineless durian clone D172 is registered by Agriculture Department on 17 June 1989. It was called \"Durian Botak\" (Bald Durian). In Indonesia, Ir Sumeru Ashari, head of Durian Research Centre, Universitas Brawijaya reported spineless durian from Kasembon, Malang. Another cultivar is from Lombok, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Indonesia.\n\nAnimals such as Sumatran elephants and tigers are known to consume durians.\n\nOne of the names Thailand contributed to the list of storm names for Western North Pacific tropical cyclones was 'Durian', which was retired after the second storm of this name in 2006. Being a fruit much loved by a variety of wild beasts, the durian sometimes signifies the long-forgotten animalistic aspect of humans, as in the legend of Orang Mawas, the Malaysian version of Bigfoot, and Orang Pendek, its Sumatran version, both of which have been claimed to feast on durians.\n\nIn Malaysia, a decoction of the leaves and roots used to be prescribed as an antipyretic. The leaf juice is applied on the head of a fever patient. The most complete description of the medicinal use of the durian as remedies for fevers is a Malay prescription, collected by Burkill and Haniff in 1930. It instructs the reader to boil the roots of \"Hibiscus rosa-sinensis\" with the roots of \"Durio zibethinus\", \"Nephelium longan\", \"Nephelium mutabile\" and \"Artocarpus integrifolia\", and drink the decoction or use it as a poultice.\n\nSoutheast Asian traditional beliefs, as well as traditional Chinese medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people with high blood pressure are traditionally advised not to consume durian.\n\nThe Javanese believe durian to have aphrodisiac qualities, and impose a set of rules on what may or may not be consumed with it or shortly thereafter. A saying in Indonesian, \"durian jatuh sarung naik\", meaning \"the durian falls and the sarong comes up\", refers to this belief. The warnings against the supposed lecherous quality of this fruit soon spread to the West – the Swedenborgian philosopher Herman Vetterling commented on so-called \"erotic properties\" of the durian in the early 20th century.\n\n\na. Wallace makes an almost identical comment in his 1866 publication \"The Malay Archipelago: The land of the orang-utang and the bird of paradise\".\n\nb. The traveller Wallace cites is Linschott (Wallace's spelling for Jan Huyghen van Linschoten), whose name appears repeatedly in Internet searches on durian, with such citations themselves tracing back to Wallace. In translations of Linschoten's writings, the fruit is spelled as \"duryoen\".\n"}

The particles are held there by surface tension. Normally the surface tension does not in itself give rise to an attraction or repulsion among particles on a meniscus. A capillary interaction requires that the particles are pushed or pulled away from the meniscus, for instance because of their weight, if the particles are large and heavy enough.\n\nIt has been proposed by Nikolaides et al. that the observed attractions are the result of an electrostatic pressure on the liquid interface, due to electric charges on the particles. The electrostatic pressure arises because the dielectric constants of the liquids differ. Due to the pressure, the liquid interface deforms. This pressure is balanced by a simultaneous electrostatic force acting on the charges, and hence on the particle itself. The force has been coined the \"electrodipping force\" by Kralchevsky et al. - it dips the particle in one of the liquids.\n\nAccording to Nikolaides, the electrostatic force engenders a long range capillary attraction. However, this explanation is controversial; other authors have argued that the capillary effect of the electrodipping force is in fact cancelled by the electrostatic pressure on the interface, so the resulting capillary effect would be insignificant.\n\n"}

{"id": "22976317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22976317", "title": "Förster coupling", "text": "Förster coupling\n\nFörster coupling is the resonant energy transfer between excitons within adjacent QD's (quantum dots). The first studies of Foerster were performed in the context of the sensitized luminescence of solids. Here, an excited sensitizer atom can transfer its excitation to a neighbouring acceptor atom, via an intermediate virtual photon. This same mechanism has also been shown to be responsible for exciton transfer between QD’s and within molecular systems and biosystems (though incoherently, as a mechanism for photosynthesis), all of which may be treated in a similar formulation. (See also Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).)\n\nIn the introductory lecture given by T. Förster, he considered the transfer of electronic excitation energy between otherwise well-separated atomic or molecular electronic systems, which exclude the trivial case of an excitation transfer that consists in the emission of one quantum of light by the first atom or molecule followed by re-absorption by the second one. It is only the non-radiative transfer of excitation occurring during the short lifetimes of excited electronic systems which he considered there.\n\nThe first observation of energy transfer was made by Cario and Franck (1922) in their classical experiments on sensitized fluorescence of atoms in the vapour phase. A mixture of mercury and thallium vapour, when irradiated with the light of the mercury resonance line, shows the emission spectra of both atoms. Since thallium atoms do not absorb the exciting light, they can get excited only indirectly by an excitation transfer from mercury atoms. A transfer by reabsorption is impossible here. Therefore, this transfer must be a non-radiative one with a mercury atom as the donor or sensitizer and the thallium atom as the acceptor. Unfortunately, in this case it cannot be decided whether the transfer occurs between distant atoms or during a normal collision or even in a labile molecule formed as an intermediate. This decision, however, was possible in similar cases, as in the mercury-sensitized fluorescence of sodium and in the mutual sensitization of the fluorescence of different mercury isotopes. In these cases, the transfer occurs over distances very much larger than those in normal collisional separations. Similar observations of sensitized fluorescence were made with molecular vapours and in solution.\n\nFurther experiments have shown that in this case the transfer occurs not over collisional distances but over the mean intermolecular distances of sensitizer and acceptor, corresponding to a concentration of 10 to 10M. This is demonstrated by the fact that sensitization occurs with similar half-value concentrations in solution of very different viscosities and even in organic glasses at low temperature. The possibility of the formation of a complex between sensitizer and acceptor molecules was excluded by the additivity of the absorption spectra and the different dependence on concentration to be expected in this case. It must be concluded, therefore, that excitation transfer of a non-trivial nature occurs over the mean distances between statistically distributed molecules which are about 40Å in this case. It differs from short-distance collisional transfer by its independence of solvent viscosity and from transfer within a molecular complex by the constancy of absorption spectra and the decrease in sensitizer fluorescence lifetime.\n\nTable 2 summarizes some qualitative features of this kind of long-range transfer and of some more or less trivial mechanisms. The non-trivial transfer differs from re-absorption transfer by its independence of the volume of the solution, by the decrease in sensitizer fluorescence lifetime, and by the invariability of the sensitizer fluorescence spectrum. It differs from short-distance collisional transfer by its independence of solvent viscosity and from transfer within a molecular complex by the constancy of absorption spectra and the decrease in sensitizer fluorescence lifetime. In most cases, some of these different properties allow a decision between trivial and non-trivial transfer mechanisms. Further discriminations may be made by quantitative studies of these properties.\n\n The electrons interact via the Coulomb interaction, given by the Hamiltonian\nwhere the Coulomb matrix element is given by\nHere, formula_3 is the dielectric constant of the medium.\n\nTo calculate the dynamics of two coupled QDs (each modeled as an interband two-level system with one conduction and one valence level formula_4and formula_5, respectively) which have no electronic overlap, an expansion of the potential is performed: (i) a long-range expansion about a reference point of each QD, varying on a mesoscopic scale and neglecting the variation on the scale of the elementary cell - this yields level diagonal contributions in the Hamiltonian formula_6 and \nformula_7 ; and (ii) a short-range expansion about an arbitrary lattice vector, taking into account the microscopic variation of the QD - this yields nondiagonal contributions formula_8 . On the dipole-dipole level, the level diagonal elements correspond to an electrostatic energetic shift of the system (biexcitonic shift formula_9), while the nondiagonal elements, the so-called Förster coupling elements formula_10, correspond to an excitation transfer between the different QDs.\n\nHere\n\n, we shall consider excitons in two coupled QD’s and the Coulomb interactions between them. More specifically, we shall derive an analytical expression for the strength of the inter-dot Foerster coupling. It can be also shown that this coupling is, under certain conditions, of dipole-dipole type and that it is responsible for resonant exciton exchange between adjacent QD’s. This is a transfer of energy only, not a tunnelling effect.\n\nwe write the Hamiltonian of two interacting QD’s in the computational basis\nformula_11\n\nformula_12\n\nwhere the off-diagonal Förster interaction is given by formula_10\n, and the direct Coulomb binding energy between the two excitons, one on each dot, is on the diagonal and given by formula_14\n. The ground state energy is denoted by formula_15\n, and formula_16 is the difference between the excitation energy for dot I and that for dot II. These excitation energies and inter-dot interactions are all functions of the applied field F.\n\nIt is also straightforward to see that an off-diagonal Förster coupling does indeed correspond to a resonant transfer of energy; if we begin in the state\nformula_17 (exciton on dot I, no exciton on dot II) this will naturally evolve to a state\nformula_18\n\n\n"}

{"id": "402179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=402179", "title": "Nor'easter", "text": "Nor'easter\n\nA nor'easter (also northeaster; see below) is a macro-scale extratropical cyclone in the western North Atlantic ocean. The name derives from the direction of the strongest winds that will be hitting an eastern seaboard of the northern hemisphere: as a cyclonic air mass rotates counterclockwise, winds tend to blow northeast-to-southwest over the region covered by the northwest quadrant of the cyclone. Use of the term in North America is associated with storms that impact the middle and north Atlantic areas of the United States, and in the Atlantic Provinces of Canada. \n\nTypically, such storms originate as a low-pressure area that forms within of the shore between North Carolina and Massachusetts. The precipitation pattern is similar to that of other extratropical storms. Nor'easters are usually accompanied by very heavy rain or snow, and can cause severe coastal flooding, coastal erosion, hurricane-force winds, or blizzard conditions. Nor'easters are usually most intense during winter in New England and Atlantic Canada. They thrive on converging air masses—the cold polar air mass and the warmer air over the water—and are more severe in winter when the difference in temperature between these air masses is greater.\n\nNor'easters tend to develop most often and most powerfully between the months of November and March, although they can (much less commonly) develop during other parts of the year as well. The susceptible regions are generally impacted by nor'easters a few times each winter.\n\nThe term \"nor'easter\" came to American English by way of British English. The earliest recorded uses of the contraction \"nor\" (for \"north\") in combinations such as \"nor'-east\" and \"nor-nor-west\", as reported by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", date to the late 16th century, as in John Davis's 1594 \"The Seaman's Secrets\": \"Noreast by North raiseth a degree in sayling 24 leagues.\" The spelling appears, for instance, on a compass card published in 1607. Thus, the manner of pronouncing from memory the 32 points of the compass, known in maritime training as \"boxing the compass\", is described by Ansted with pronunciations \"Nor'east (or west),\" \"Nor' Nor'-east (or west),\" \"Nor'east b' east (or west),\" and so forth. According to the OED, the first recorded use of the term \"nor'easter\" occurs in 1836 in a translation of Aristophanes. The term \"nor'easter\" naturally developed from the historical spellings and pronunciations of the compass points and the direction of wind or sailing.\n\nAs noted in a January 2006 editorial by William Sisson, editor of \"Soundings\" magazine, use of \"nor'easter\" to describe the storm system is common along the U.S. East Coast. Yet it has been asserted by linguist Mark Liberman (see below) that \"nor'easter\" as a contraction for \"northeaster\" has no basis in regional New England dialect; the Boston accent would elide the \"R\": \"no'theastuh\"'. He describes nor'easter as a \"fake\" word. However, this view neglects the little-known etymology and the historical maritime usage described above.\n\n19th-century Downeast mariners pronounced the compass point \"north northeast\" as \"no'nuth-east\", and so on. For decades, Edgar Comee, of Brunswick, Maine, waged a determined battle against use of the term \"nor'easter\" by the press, which usage he considered \"a pretentious and altogether lamentable affectation\" and \"the odious, even loathsome, practice of landlubbers who would be seen as salty as the sea itself\". His efforts, which included mailing hundreds of postcards, were profiled, just before his death at the age of 88, in \"The New Yorker\".\n\nDespite the efforts of Comee and others, use of the term continues by the press. According to \"Boston Globe\" writer Jan Freeman, \"from 1975 to 1980, journalists used the nor’easter spelling only once in five mentions of such storms; in the past year (2003), more than 80 percent of northeasters were spelled nor'easter\".\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania linguistics professor Mark Liberman has pointed out that while the Oxford English Dictionary cites examples dating back to 1837, these examples represent the contributions of a handful of non-New England poets and writers. Liberman posits that \"nor'easter\" may have originally been a literary affectation, akin to \"e'en\" for \"even\" and \"th'only\" for \"the only\", which is an indication in spelling that two syllables count for only one position in metered verse, with no implications for actual pronunciation.\n\nHowever, despite these assertions, the term can be found in the writings of New Englanders, and was frequently used by the press in the 19th century.\n\nUsage existed into the 20th century in the form of:\n\nNor'easters develop in response to the sharp contrast in the warm Gulf Stream ocean current coming up from the tropical Atlantic and the cold air masses coming down from Canada. When the very cold and dry air rushes southward and meets up with the warm Gulf stream current, which is often near even in mid-winter, intense low pressure develops.\n\nIn the upper atmosphere, the strong winds of the jet stream remove and replace rising air from the Atlantic more rapidly than the Atlantic air is replaced at lower levels; this and the Coriolis force help develop a strong storm. The storm tracks northeast along the East Coast, normally from North Carolina to Long Island, then moves toward the area east of Cape Cod. Counterclockwise winds around the low-pressure system blow the moist air over land. The relatively warm, moist air meets cold air coming southward from Canada. The low increases the surrounding pressure difference, which causes the very different air masses to collide at a faster speed. When the difference in temperature of the air masses is larger, so is the storm's instability, turbulence, and thus severity.\n\nThe nor'easters taking the East Coast track usually indicates the presence of a high-pressure area in the vicinity of Nova Scotia. Sometimes a nor'easter will move slightly inland and bring rain to the cities on the coastal plain (New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, etc.) and snow in New England (Boston northward). It can move slightly offshore, bringing a wet snow south of Boston to Richmond, Virginia, or even parts of the Carolinas. Such a storm will rapidly intensify, tracking northward and following the topography of the East Coast, sometimes continuing to grow stronger during its entire existence. A nor'easter usually reaches its peak intensity while off the Canadian coast. The storm then reaches Arctic areas, and can reach intensities equal to that of a weak hurricane. It then meanders throughout the North Atlantic and can last for several weeks.\n\nNor'easters are usually formed by an area of vorticity associated with an upper-level disturbance or from a kink in a frontal surface that causes a surface low-pressure area to develop. Such storms are very often formed from the merging of several weaker storms, a \"parent storm\", and a polar jet stream mixing with the tropical jet stream.\n\nUntil the nor'easter passes, thick, dark, low-level clouds often block out the sun. Temperatures usually fall significantly due to the presence of the cooler air from winds that typically come from a northeasterly direction. During a single storm, the precipitation can range from a torrential downpour to a fine mist. All precipitation types can occur in a nor'easter. High wind gusts, which can reach hurricane strength, are also associated with a nor'easter. On very rare occasions, such as in the nor'easter in 1978, North American blizzard of 2006, and January 2018 North American blizzard, the center of the storm can take on the circular shape more typical of a hurricane and have a small \"dry slot\" near the center, which can be mistaken for an eye, although it is not an eye.\n\nOften, people mistake nor'easters for tropical cyclones and do not differentiate between the two weather systems. Nor'easters differ from tropical cyclones in that nor'easters are cold-core low-pressure systems, meaning that they thrive on drastic changes in temperature of Canadian air and warm Atlantic waters. Tropical cyclones are warm-core low-pressure systems, which means they thrive on purely warm temperatures.\n\nA nor'easter is formed in a strong extratropical cyclone, usually experiencing bombogenesis. While this formation occurs in many places around the world, nor'easters are unique for their combination of northeast winds and moisture content of the swirling clouds. Nearly similar conditions sometimes occur during winter in the Pacific Northeast (northern Japan and northwards) with winds from NW-N. In Europe, similar weather systems with such severity are hardly possible; the moisture content of the clouds is usually not high enough to cause flooding or heavy snow, though NE winds can be strong.\n\nThe eastern United States, from North Carolina to Maine, and Eastern Canada can experience nor'easters, though most often they affect the areas from northern New Jersey northward. The effects of a nor'easter sometimes bring high surf and strong winds as far south as coastal South Carolina and Georgia. Nor'easters cause a significant amount of beach erosion in these areas, as well as flooding in the associated low-lying areas.\n\nBiologists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod have determined nor'easters are an environmental factor for red tides on the Atlantic coast.\n\nA list of nor'easters with short description about the events.\n\n"}

Such rocks that have a distinct difference in the size of the crystals are called porphyries, and the adjective porphyritic is used to describe them. Phenocrysts often have euhedral forms, either due to early growth within a magma, or by post-emplacement recrystallization. Normally the term \"phenocryst\" is not used unless the crystals are directly observable, which is sometimes stated as greater than .5 millimeter in diameter. Phenocrysts below this level, but still larger than the groundmass crystals, are termed \"microphenocrysts\". Very large phenocrysts are termed \" megaphenocrysts\". Some rocks contain both microphenocrysts and megaphenocrysts. In metamorphic rocks, crystals similar to phenocrysts are called porphyroblasts.\n\nPhenocrysts are more often found in the lighter (higher silica) igneous rocks such as felsites and andesites, although they occur throughout the igneous spectrum including in the ultramafics. The largest crystals found in some pegmatites are often phenocrysts being significantly larger than the other minerals.\n\nRocks can be classified according to the nature, size and abundance of phenocrysts, and the presence or absence of phenocrysts is often noted when a rock name is determined. \"Aphyric\" is a term used to describe rocks that have no phenocrysts, or more commonly where the phenocrysts consist of less than 1% phenocrysts (by volume); while the adjective \"phyric\" is sometimes used instead of the term \"porphyritic\" to indicate the presence of phenocrysts. Porphyritic rocks are often named using mineral name modifiers, normally in decreasing order of abundance. Thus when olivine forms the primary phenocrysts in a basalt, the name may be refined from \"basalt\" to \"porphyritic olivine basalt\" or \"olivine phyric basalt\". Similarly, a basalt with olivine as the dominate phenocrysts, but with lesser amounts of plagioclase phenocrysts, might be termed a \"olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt\".\n\nIn more complex nomenclature, a basalt with approximately 1% plagioclase phenocrysts, but 4% olivine microphenocrysts, might be termed an \"aphyric to sparsely plagioclase-olivine phyric basalt\", where plagioclase is listed before the olivine, because of its larger crystals. Categorizing a rock as aphyric or as sparsely phyric is often a question of whether a significant number of crystals exceed the minimum size.\n\nGeologists use phenocrysts to help determine rock origins and transformations, as when and whether crystals form depends on pressure and on temperature. Fumiko Shido first applied this technique to oceanic basalts, further development came from Tsugio Shibata, and from W. B. Bryan.\n\nPlagioclase phenocrysts often exhibit zoning with a more calcic core surrounded by progressively more sodic rinds. This zoning reflects the change in magma composition as crystallization progresses. In rapakivi granites, phenocrysts of orthoclase are enveloped within \"rinds\" of sodic plagioclase such as oligoclase. In shallow intrusives or volcanic flows phenocrysts which formed before eruption or shallow emplacement are surrounded by a fine-grained to glassy matrix. These volcanic phenocrysts often show flow banding, a parallel arrangement of lath-shaped crystals. These characteristics provide clues to the rocks' origins. Similarly, intragranular microfractures and any intergrowth among crystals provide additional clues.\n\n"}
{"id": "47863693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47863693", "title": "Pigeon pea", "text": "Pigeon pea\n\nThe pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) is a perennial legume from the family Fabaceae. Since its domestication in the Indian subcontinent at least 3,500 years ago, its seeds have become a common food in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is consumed on a large scale mainly in south Asia and is a major source of protein for the population of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe pigeon pea is known by numerous names in various languages around the world. Since there are many languages in the Indian subcontinent, there is a plethora of names used for this legume in that region.\n\n\n\nThe cultivation of the pigeon pea goes back at least 3,500 years. The centre of origin is probably peninsular India, where the closest wild relatives (\"Cajanus cajanifolia\") occur in tropical deciduous woodlands. Archaeological finds of pigeon pea dating to about 3,400 years ago (14th century BC) have been found at Neolithic sites in Kalaburagi, Karnataka (Sanganakallu) and its border areas (Tuljapur Garhi in Maharashtra and Gopalpur in Orissa) and also the south Indian states such as Kerala, where it is called Tomara Payaru. From India it traveled to East Africa and West Africa. There, it was first encountered by Europeans, so it obtained the name Congo Pea. By means of the slave trade, it came to the American continent, probably in the 17th century.\n\nToday, pigeon pea is widely cultivated in all tropical and semitropical regions of both the Old and the New Worlds.\n\nWorld production of pigeon peas is estimated at 4.49 million tons. About 63% of this production comes from India. Africa is the secondary centre of diversity and at present it contributes about 21% of global production with 1.05 million tons. Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique and Uganda are the major producers in Africa.\n\nThe total number of hectares grown to pigeon pea is estimated at 5.4 million. India accounts for 72% of area grown to pigeon pea or 3.9 million hectares.\n\nPigeon pea is an important legume crop of rainfed agriculture in the semiarid tropics. The Indian subcontinent, eastern Africa and Central America, in that order, are the world's three main pigeon pea-producing regions. Pigeon peas are cultivated in more than 25 tropical and subtropical countries, either as a sole crop or intermixed with cereals, such as sorghum (\"Sorghum bicolor\"), pearl millet (\"Pennisetum glaucum\"), or maize (\"Zea mays\"), or with other legumes, such as peanuts (\"Arachis hypogaea\"). Being a legume capable of symbiosis with Rhizobia, the bacteria associated with the pigeon pea enrich soils through symbiotic nitrogen fixation.\n\nPigeon peas can be of a perennial variety, in which the crop can last three to five years (although the seed yield drops considerably after the first two years), or an annual variety more suitable for seed production.\n\nThe crop is cultivated on marginal land by resource-poor farmers, who commonly grow traditional medium- and long-duration (5–11 months) landraces. Short-duration pigeon peas (3–4 months) suitable for multiple cropping have recently been developed. Traditionally, the use of such input as fertilizers, weeding, irrigation, and pesticides is minimal, so present yield levels are low (average = 700 kg/ha). Greater attention is now being given to managing the crop because it is in high demand at remunerative prices.\n\nPigeon peas are very drought-resistant and can be grown in areas with less than 650 mm annual rainfall. With the maize crop failing three out of five years in drought-prone areas of Kenya, a consortium led by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) aimed to promote the pigeon pea as a drought-resistant, nutritious alternative crop. Successive projects encouraged commercialization of legumes, by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing. This work, which included linking producers to wholesalers, helped to increase local producer prices by 20–25% in Nairobi and Mombasa. The commercialization of the pigeon pea is now enabling farmers to buy assets, ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock, and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty.\n\nJohn Spence, a botanist and politician from Trinidad and Tobago, developed several varieties of dwarf pigeon peas which can be harvested by machine, instead of by hand.\n\nDehulling pigeon peas is an age old practice in India. In earlier days hand pounding was common. Several traditional methods are used, that can be broadly classified under two categories:\n\nInvolves water soaking, sun drying and dehulling.\n\nInvolves oil/water application, drying in the sun, and dehulling. Depending on the magnitude of operation, large scale commercial dehulling of large quantities of pigeon pea into its deskinned, split version known as toor dal in Hindi, is done in mechanically operated mills.\n\nPigeon peas are both a food crop (dried peas, flour, or green vegetable peas) and a forage/cover crop. In combination with cereals, pigeon peas make a well-balanced meal and hence are favoured by nutritionists as an essential ingredient for balanced diets. The dried peas may be sprouted briefly, then cooked, for a flavor different from the green or dried peas. Sprouting also enhances the digestibility of dried pigeon peas via the reduction of indigestible sugars that would otherwise remain in the cooked dried peas.\n\nIn India, split pigeon peas, called \"tur\" (तूर) in Marathi, \"toor dal\" (तूर दाल) or 'arhar' (अरहर) in Hindi and \"arehar ki dal\" in Urdu, \"kandhi pappu\" (కంది పప్పు) in Telugu, \"thuvara parippa\" in Kerala and \"thuvaram paruppu\" in Tamil Nadu, \"togari bele\" in Kannada are one of the most popular pulses, being an important source of protein in a mostly vegetarian diet. In regions where it grows, fresh young pods are eaten as a vegetable in dishes such as \"sambar\". Whole pigeon peas are called \"arhar dal\" in Hindi. In Ethiopia, not only the pods, but also the young shoots and leaves are cooked and eaten.\n\nIn some places, such as the Caribbean coast of Colombia, Dominican Republic, Panama and Hawaii, pigeon peas are grown for canning and consumption. A dish made of rice and green pigeon peas (called \"moro de guandules\") is a traditional food in the Dominican Republic. Pigeon peas are also made as a stew, with plantain balls. In Puerto Rico, \"arroz con gandules\" is made with rice and pigeon peas and is a traditional dish, especially during Christmas season. Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada have their own variant, called \"pelau\", which includes either beef or chicken, and occasionally pumpkin and pieces of cured pig tail. In the Atlantico department of Colombia the sopa de guandú con carne salada (or simply \"gandules\") is made with pigeon peas.\n\nUnlike in some other parts of the Greater Caribbean, in The Bahamas the light brown colored dried seeds of the pigeon pea plant are used (instead of the fresh green pigeon peas used elsewhere) to make the heartier, heavier, signature Bahamian staple dish \"Peas 'n Rice.\" A slab of partially cubed or diced pork \"fatback\" lard with skin on (bacon is a common substitute), diced onions and sweet pepper, and a mixture of spices are all sauteed in the bottom of a deep pot. Tomatoes and tomato paste are added. Then water is added along with the peas and rice, and slow boiled until tender. The dish becomes a medium-dark brown color, resulting from absorbing the colors of the browned initial ingredients and the cooked tomato paste. The pigeon peas themselves absorb the same, becoming a much darker brown, providing some contrast while still complementing the distinctive \"browned\" theme of the dish.\n\nIn Thailand, pigeon peas are grown as a host for scale insects which produce lac, the key ingredient in shellac.\n\nPigeon peas are in some areas an important crop for green manure, providing up to 90 kg nitrogen per hectare. The woody stems of pigeon peas can also be used as firewood, fencing and thatch.\n\nIt is an important ingredient of animal feed used in West Africa, especially in Nigeria, where it is also grown. Leaves, pods, seeds and the residues of seed processing are used to feed all kinds of livestock.\n\nThe pigeon pea is the first seed legume plant to have its complete genome sequenced. The sequencing was first accomplished by a group of 31 Indian scientists from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. It was then followed by a global research partnership, the International Initiative for Pigeonpea Genomics (IIPG), led by ICRISAT with partners such as BGI–Shenzhen (China), US research laboratories like University of Georgia, University of California-Davis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and National Centre for Genome Resources, European research institutes like the National University of Ireland Galway. It also received support from the CGIAR Generation Challenge Programme, US National Science Foundation and in-kind contribution from the collaborating research institutes. It is the first time that a CGIAR-supported research center such as ICRISAT led the genome sequencing of a food crop. There was a controversy over this as CGIAR did not partner with a national team of scientists and broke away from the Indo American Knowledge Initiative to parallelly start their own sequencing.\n\nThe 616 mature microRNAs and 3919 long non-codingRNAs sequences were identified in the genome of pigeon pea.\n\nPigeon peas contain high levels of protein and the important amino acids methionine, lysine, and tryptophan.\n\nThe following table indicates completeness of nutritional profile of various amino acids within mature seeds of pigeon pea.\n\nAs can be seen from the table above, Methionine+Cystine combination is the only limiting amino acid combination in pigeon pea. In contrast to the mature seeds, the immature seeds are generally lower in all nutritional values, however they contain a significant amount of vitamin C (39 mg per 100 g serving) and have a slightly higher fat content. Research has shown that the protein content of the immature seeds is of a higher quality.\n\n\n\n"}

If the material is not at first solid, then it freezes under the reduced pressure. Conditions are so chosen that the solid volatilizes and condenses as a purified compound on a cooled surface, leaving the non-volatile residual impurities or solid products behind. \n\nThe form of the cooled surface often is a so-called cold finger.

Thermodynamic processes follow a statistical distribution, and suitably designed apparatus exploit this principle with a gradient that will yield different purities in particular temperature zones along the collection surface. Such techniques are especially helpful when the requirement is to refine or separate multiple products or impurities from the same mix of raw materials.

Ti-6Al-7Nb is used as a material for hip protheses. \nTi―6Al―7Nb is one of the titanium alloys that built of hexagonal α phase (stabilised with aluminium) and regular body-centred phase β (stabilised with niobium). The alloy is characterized by added advantageous mechanical properties, it has higher corrosion resistance and biotolerance in relation to Ti-6Al-V alloys.\n\nMechanical properties of the alloy are mostly dependent on the morphology and the fractions volume of the phases presence from the parameters obtained from the manufacturing process.\n\nAs shown in the above table, alloying is one of the effective methods to improve the mechanical properties and since Niobium belongs to the same group of Vanadium in the periodic table it is of course acts as α –β stabilizing elements (similar to Ti-6AL-4V alloy), however the strength of Nb alloy is little less than that of Ti-6AL-4V .The main difference between Ti-6AL-4V and Ti―6Al―7Nb is related to different factors such as solid-solution strengthening, the structure-refining strengthening provided by the refined two-phase structure and the difference in the microstructure between the two alloys.\n\nTi-6Al-7Nb is produced by powder metallurgy methods. The most common methods are hot pressing, metal injection mouldering and blending and pressing. In the production of Ti-6Al-7Nb a sintering temperature between 900-1400 C usually are used. Altering the sintering temperature gives the Ti-6Al-7Nb different properties such as different porosity and microstructure. It also gives a different composition between alpha, beta and alpha+beta phases. In the recent years Ti-6Al-7Nb alloys could also be made by different 3D-printer technique such as SLM and EBM.\n\nHeat treatment of titanium is demonstrated to have significant influences on reducing the residual stresses, improving the mechanical properties (i.e. tensile strength or fatigue strength by solution treatment and ageing). Moreover, heat treatment provides an ideal combination of ductility, machinability and structural stability due to the differences in microstructure and cooling rates between α and β phases.\n\nThe cooling rate have an impact of the morphology . When the cooling rate is reduced for example from air cool to slow cooling, the morphology of the transformed α increases in thickness and length and is contained within fewer, larger α colonies. The α colony size is the most important microstructural properties due to its influences the fatigue properties and deformation mechanics of β processed α+ β alloys.\n\n\nTi-6Al-7Nb has a high biocompatibility. The oxides from Ti-6Al-7Nb is saturated in the body and are not transported in vivo or are a bioburden.

It was the base unit of mass in the British Indian system of weights and measures introduced in 1833, although it had been in use for much longer. It was also used in Aden and Zanzibar: in the latter, one tola was equivalent to 175.90 troy grains (0.97722222 British tolas, or 11.33980925 grams).\n\nThe tola is a Vedic measure, with the name derived from the Sanskrit \"tol\" (तोलः root तुल्) meaning \"weighing\" or \"weight\". One tola was traditionally the weight of 100 ratti (ruttee) seeds, and its exact weight varied according to locality. However, it is also a convenient mass for a coin: several pre-colonial coins, including the currency of Akbar the Great (1556–1605), had a mass of \"one tola\" within slight variation. The very first rupee (; \"rupayā\"), minted by Sher Shah Suri (1540–45), had a mass of 178 troy grains, or about 1% less than the British tola. The British East India Company issued a silver rupee coin of 180 troy grains, and this became the practical standard mass for the tola well into the 20th century.\n\nThe British tola of 180 troy grains (from 1833) can be seen as more of a standardisation than a redefinition: the previous standard in the Bengal Presidency, the system of \"sicca weights\", was the mass of one Murshidabad rupee, 179.666 troy grains. For the larger weights used in commerce (in the Bengal Presidency), the variation in the pre-1833 standards was found to be greater than the adjustment.\n\nThe tola formed the base for units of mass under the British Indian system, and was also the standard measure of gold and silver bullion. Although the tola has been officially replaced by metric units since 1956, it is still in current use, and is a popular denomination for gold bullion bars in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Singapore, with a ten tola bar being the most commonly traded. In Nepal, minting of tola size gold coins continue up to the present, even though the currency of Nepal is called rupee and has no official connection to the tola. It is also used in most gold markets (bazars/souks) in the United Arab Emirates and in all the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) countries.\n\nTola is still used as a measure of \"charas.\" (Indian hashish)\n\n"}

This does not include, among other things, any farm or residential tank of 1,100 gallons or less capacity used for storing motor fuel for noncommercial purposes, tanks for storing heating oil for consumption on the premises, or septic tanks. For USTs in service in the United States the EPA and states collectively require tank operators to take financial responsibility for any releases or leaks associated with the operation of those below ground tanks. As a condition to keep a tank in operation a demonstrated ability to pay for any release must be shown via UST insurance, a bond, or some other ability to pay..\n\nIn 1984, U.S. Congress amended the Resource Conservation Recovery Act to include Subtitle I: Underground Storage Tanks, calling on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate the tanks. In 1985, when it was launched, there were more than 2 million tanks in the country and more than 750,000 owners and operators. The program was given 90 staff to oversee this responsibility. In September 1988, the EPA published initial underground storage tank regulations, including a 10-year phase-in period that required all operators to upgrade their USTs with spill prevention and leak detection equipment.\n\nEPA updated UST and state program approval regulations in 2015, the first major changes since 1988. The revisions increase the emphasis on properly operating and maintaining UST equipment. The revisions will help prevent and detect UST releases, which are a leading source of groundwater contamination. The revisions will also help ensure all USTs in the United States, including those in Indian country, meet the same minimum standards. The changes established federal requirements that are similar to key portions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. In addition, EPA added new operation and maintenance requirements and addressed UST systems deferred in the 1988 UST regulation. The changes:\n\n\nUnderground storage tanks fall into four different types:\n\n\nUnderground storage tanks for water are traditionally called cisterns and are usually constructed from bricks and mortar or concrete.\n\nPetroleum USTs are used throughout North America at automobile filling stations and by the US military. Many have leaked, allowing petroleum to contaminate the soil and groundwater and enter as vapor into buildings, ending up as brownfields or Superfund sites. Many USTs installed before 1980 consisted of bare steel pipes, which corrode over time. Faulty installation can also cause structural failure of the tank or piping, causing leaks. \n\nUSTs are regulated in the United States to prevent release of petroleum and contamination of groundwater, soil and air. The 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) required EPA to develop regulations for the underground storage of motor fuels to minimize and prevent environmental damage, by mandating owners and operators of UST systems to verify, maintain, and clean up sites damaged by petroleum contamination.\n\nIn December 1988, EPA regulations asking owners to locate, remove, upgrade, or replace underground storage tanks became effective. Each state was given authority to establish such a program within its own jurisdiction, to compensate owners for the cleanup of underground petroleum leaks, to set standards and licensing for installers, and to register and inspect underground tanks.\n\nMost upgrades to USTs consisted of the installation of corrosion control (cathodic protection, interior lining, or a combination of cathodic protection and interior lining), overfill protection (to prevent overfills of the tank during tank filling operations), spill containment (to catch spills when filling), and leak detection for both the tank and piping.\n\nMany USTs were removed without replacement during the 10-year program. Many thousands of old underground tanks were replaced with newer tanks made of corrosion resistant materials (such as fiberglass, steel clad with a thick FRP shell, and well-coated steel with galvanic anodes) and others constructed as double walled tanks to form an interstice between two tank walls (a tank within a tank) which allowed for the detection of leaks from the inner or outer tank wall through monitoring of the interstice using vacuum, pressure or a liquid sensor probe. Piping was replaced during the same period with much of the new piping being double-wall construction and made of fiberglass or plastic materials.\n\nTank monitoring systems capable of detecting small leaks (must be capable of detecting a 0.1 gallons-per-hour with a probability of detection of 95% or greater and a probability of false alarm of 5% or less) were installed and other methods were adopted to alert the tank operator of leaks and potential leaks.\n\nU.S. regulations required that UST cathodic protection systems be tested by a cathodic protection expert (minimum every three years) and that systems be monitored to ensure continued compliant operation.\n\nSome industrial owners, who previously stored fuel in underground tanks, switched to above-ground tanks to avoid environmental regulations that require monitoring of fuel storage. Many states, however, do not permit above-ground storage of motor fuel for resale to the public.\n\nThe EPA Underground Storage Tank Program is considered to have been very successful. The national inventory of underground tanks has been reduced by more than half, and most of the rest have been replaced or upgraded to much safer standards. Of the approximately one million underground storage tanks sites in the United States as of 2008, most of which handled some type of fuel, an estimated 500,000 have had leaks. , there were approximately 600,000 active USTs at 223,000 sites subject to federal regulation.\nIn 2012, EPA published how to screen buildings vulnerable to petroleum vapor intrusion, and in June 2015, U.S. EPA finally released its\n\"Technical Guide for Assessing and Mitigating the Vapor Intrusion Pathway from Subsurface Vapor Sources to Indoor Air\"\nand \"Technical Guide For Addressing Petroleum Vapor Intrusion At Leaking Underground Storage Tank Sites\"\n\n\n"}

Like the notion of hundredweight, the zentner is the weight of 100 units, where the value of the unit depends on the time and location. Traditionally the unit was one hundred pounds (German \"Pfund\"), or roughly 50000 grams – the precise value being context-dependent – making one zentner equal to about 50 kilograms.\n\nIn later times, with the adoption of the metric system, the value came to denote exactly 50 kg, at least in Germany; in Austria and Switzerland the term is now in use for a measure of 100 kg, as it is in Russia (, \"tsentner\"). In Germany a measure of 100 kg is named a Doppelzentner.\n\n\n"}
