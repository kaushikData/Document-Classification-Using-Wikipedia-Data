It was intended to allow more powerful electrically-driven accessories, and lighter automobile wiring harnesses. Electric motors were proposed to be used for power steering or other systems, providing more compact installations and eliminating the weight of drive belts or large wires for high-current loads. \n\nThe proposed new standard was more than triple the voltage of existing \"12 volt\" systems. The higher voltage was selected to provide greater power capacity for wiring and devices on one hand, and to stay under the 50 volt limit used as a guideline for electric shock hazard. The European auto manufacturer Daimler-Benz proposed a \"42V\" brand name for the conversion.\n\nAlthough many manufacturers were predicting a switch to 36-volt (lithium ion battery) / 42-volt (charging voltage) electrical systems, the changeover has not occurred, and the plans appear to have been canceled. The availability of higher-efficiency motors, new wiring techniques and digital controls, and a focus on hybrid vehicle systems that use high-voltage starter/generators has largely eliminated the push for switching the main automotive voltages. Applications that once were thought to require higher voltages, such as electrical power steering, have now been achieved with 12 volt systems. 42-volt electrical components are now used in only a few automotive applications, since incandescent light bulbs work well at 12 volts and switching of a 42-volt circuit is more difficult. 36-48 volt systems are (as of 2015-2020) coming back in Mild hybrid vehicles, which has some electric assist to the propulsion and has regeneration at braking, for fuel saving.\n\nThe SAE discussed an increased automobile standard voltage as early as 1988.\n\nIn 1994, at the initiative of Daimler-Benz, the first \"Workshop on Advanced Architectures for Automotive Electrical Distribution Systems\" was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems (MIT/LEES) in Cambridge, Massachusetts USA. with the aim of defining the architecture for a future automotive electrical system. From the outset, the participants in this workshop included suppliers as well as the automobile companies Daimler-Benz, Ford and General Motors.\n\nIn September 1995, various electrical systems architectures were compared at MIT using the tool \"MAESTrO\", and in December 1995, in the \"Conclusions\" of this study, a future voltage level of approximately was defined.\n\nIn early 1996, the \"Consortium on Advanced Automotive Electrical and Electronic Systems\" was set up. At the ensuing workshop in March 1996, the future nominal voltage of 42 V was confirmed.\n\nIn August 1996, IEEE Spectrum published the paper \"Automotive electrical systems circa 2005\".\n\nOn the occasion of the October 1996 Convergence in Detroit, Professor John G. Kassakian (MIT) gave a talk entitled \"The Future of Automotive Electrical Systems\" as part of the \"IEEE Workshop on Automotive Power- Electronics\".\n\nOn March 24, 1997, Daimler-Benz presented the MIT with a \"Draft Specification of a Dual Voltage Vehicle Electrical Power System 42V/14V\".\n\nAt the same time as the activities in the USA, in 1994, again at the initiative of Daimler-Benz, the former SICAN GmbH held its first \"Forum Bordnetz\" (Vehicle Electrical System Forum) in Hanover for German automobile companies. Here too, suppliers were invited to participate at a very early stage, together with all European vehicle manufacturers.\n\nOn February 15, 1996, the introductory paper \"Bordnetzarchitektur im Jahr 2005\" (Automotive electrical system architecture for the year 2005) was agreed, and on June 4, 1996, BMW presented the \"Tabelle heutiger und zukünftiger Verbraucher im Kfz\" (Table of present and future loads in the motor vehicle) and the \"42V/14V-Bordnetz\" (42V/14V PowerNet).\n\nOn September 13, 1996, at the 7th International Technical Meeting for Vehicle Electronics in Baden-Baden, considerable interest was raised by the paper \"Neue Bordnetz- Architektur und Konsequenzen\" (New Automotive Electrical System Architecture and Consequences), presented by Dr. Richard D. Tabors (MIT).\n\nOn March 6, 1997, BMW presented the \"Spezifikationsentwurf für das Zwei-Spannungsbordnetz 42V/14V\" (Draft Specification of a Dual Voltage Vehicle Electrical Power System 42V/14V) in Hanover.\n\nThe work at SICAN GmbH was given decisive impetus by the cooperation between BMW and Daimler-Benz, as witnessed in their joint definition of the European \"Load List 2005\" and the jointly authored \"Draft Specification of a Dual Voltage Vehicle Electrical Power System 42V/14V\".\n\nIn 2011, several German car makers agreed on a 48V on-board electric power supply network supplementing the current 12V network and introduced the \"Combo plug\", a common power plug for DC charging electric vehicles. As of 2018, this 48-volt electrical system has been applied in production vehicles such as Porsche and Bentley SUVs, and Volvo and Audi plan to use the 48-volt standard in 2019 vehicles.\n\nSix-cell lead-acid batteries produce around 12.6 volts while discharging, and their corresponding automotive alternators are designed to produce 13.5 to during charging. is an approximation of the output of the new standard's charging system. The present nominally automotive electrical system usually operates around so is descriptive. Literature on electrical systems often refers to systems powered with a 6-cell lead-acid battery as nominally Depending on operating conditions, the vehicle electrical system voltage today can vary between with a varying degree of ripple superimposed on this value. \n\nAfter extensive preparatory work, resulting in the \"List of Loads in the Automobile of the Year 2005\", various automotive electrical system architectures were compared using the tool \"MAESTrO\" ( and ) in the September 1995 workshop at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT/LEES). The finding of this study was that the highest possible direct voltage was the best alternative.\n\nThe limiting factor for direct voltages is a shock-hazard protection limit of which must not be exceeded even during voltage fluctuations caused by extreme conditions. This limit eliminates the option of an automotive electrical system with a nominal battery voltage of because at low temperatures the charging voltage of the battery can attain Also, the price, weight and volume of batteries are influenced by the number of cells, which must therefore be kept to a minimum. \n\nNew battery technologies for automotive applications would not have been available at affordable costs for the PowerNet. Lead-acid batteries are low-priced and have a very \"compliant\" charging/discharging characteristic. Therefore, lead-acid batteries would have been used optimised for energy and service life at the lower voltage and optimised for power at the higher voltage.\n\nAnother important criterion for a new architecture was that it should allow gradual conversion of loads to the higher voltage system as required. \n\nIn a system, the branch should have been freed of higher-power loads and should operate within much narrower limits.\n\nPower electronics is becoming increasingly important in the automotive sphere and will be a decisive factor in the price of future vehicles. This criterion was therefore especially important when selecting the most suitable higher voltage level. Despite the considerable upward trend of power electronics in automotive applications, its share of the market will decline, because growth rates in other market segments are even higher. For that reason alone, a specific manufacturing technology for automotive use is inconceivable.\n\nIn intensive discussions with the major semiconductor manufacturers, a voltage of approximately was found to be advantageous. Many arguments are summarised in the paper \"Intelligente Leistungshalbleiter für zukünftige Kfz-Bordnetze\" (\"Intelligent Power Semiconductors for Future Automotive Electrical Systems\") presented by the former Siemens Semiconductors (now Infineon) at the 17th \"Elektronik im Kraftfahrzeug\" (In-Car Electronics) conference on June 3/4, 1997 in Munich.\n\nOther arguments for a higher voltage included the reduction of weight in the wiring system, improved stability, and reduced voltage drop. With three times the voltage, thick conductors can be reduced to a third of the cross-section, and at the same time the relative voltage drop can also be reduced to a third. For the same cross-section, the relative voltage drop is now no more than one ninth. The voltage level resulting from these arguments was so close to three times the present voltage that became the automatic choice for the second voltage level.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25393281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25393281", "title": "Bonding in solids", "text": "Bonding in solids\n\nSolids can be classified according to the nature of the bonding between their atomic or molecular components. The traditional classification distinguishes four kinds of bonding:\n\n\nTypical members of these classes have distinctive electron distributions,\n\nA network covalent solid consists of atoms held together by a network of covalent bonds (pairs of electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity), and hence can be regarded as a single, large molecule. The classic example is diamond; other examples include silicon, quartz and graphite.\n\n\nTheir strength, stiffness, and high melting points are consequences of the strength and stiffness of the covalent bonds that hold them together. They are also characteristically brittle because the directional nature of covalent bonds strongly resists the shearing motions associated with plastic flow, and are, in effect, broken when shear occurs. This property results in brittleness for reasons studied in the field of fracture mechanics. Network covalent solids vary from insulating to semiconducting in their behavior, depending on the band gap of the material.\n\nA standard ionic solid consists of atoms held together by ionic bonds, that is by the electrostatic attraction of opposite charges (the result of transferring electrons from atoms with lower electronegativity to atoms with higher electronegativity). Among the ionic solids are compounds formed by alkali and alkaline earth metals in combination with halogens; a classic example is table salt, sodium chloride.\n\nIonic solids are typically of intermediate strength and extremely brittle. Melting points are typically moderately high, but some combinations of molecular cations and anions yield an ionic liquid with a freezing point below room temperature. Vapour pressures in all instances are extraordinarily low; this is a consequence of the large energy required to move a bare charge (or charge pair) from an ionic medium into free space.\n\nMetallic solids are held together by a high density of shared, delocalized electrons, resulting in metallic bonding. Classic examples are metals such as copper and aluminum, but some materials are metals in an electronic sense but have negligible metallic bonding in a mechanical or thermodynamic sense (see intermediate forms). Metallic solids have, by definition, no band gap at the Fermi level and hence are conducting.\n\nSolids with purely metallic bonding are characteristically ductile and, in their pure forms, have low strength; melting points can be very low (\"e.g.,\" Mercury melts at 234 K (−39 °C). These properties are consequences of the non-directional and non-polar nature of metallic bonding, which allows atoms (and planes of atoms in a crystal lattice) to move past one another without disrupting their bonding interactions. Metals can be strengthened by introducing crystal defects (for example, by alloying) that interfere with the motion of dislocations that mediate plastic deformation. Further, some transition metals exhibit directional bonding in addition to metallic bonding; this increases shear strength and reduces ductility, imparting some of the characteristics of a covalent solid (an intermediate case below).\n\nA classic molecular solid consists of small, non-polar covalent molecules, and is held together by London dispersion forces (van der Waals forces); a classic example is paraffin wax. These forces are weak, resulting in pairwise interatomic binding energies on the order of 1/100 those of covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds. Binding energies tend to increase with increasing molecular size and polarity (see intermediate forms).\n\nSolids that are composed of small, weakly bound molecules are mechanically weak and have low melting points; an extreme case is solid molecular hydrogen, which melts at 14 K (−259 °C). The non-directional nature of dispersion forces typically allows easy plastic deformation, as planes of molecules can slide over one another without seriously disrupting their attractive interactions. Molecular solids are typically insulators with large band gaps.\n\nThe four classes of solids permit six pairwise intermediate forms:\n\nCovalent and ionic bonding form a continuum, with ionic character increasing with increasing difference in the electronegativity of the participating atoms. Covalent bonding corresponds to sharing of a pair of electrons between two atoms of essentially equal electronegativity (for example, C–C and C–H bonds in aliphatic hydrocarbons). As bonds become more polar, they become increasingly ionic in character. Metal oxides vary along the iono-covalent spectrum. The Si–O bonds in quartz, for example, are polar yet largely covalent, and are considered to be of mixed character.\n\nWhat is in most respects a purely covalent structure can support metallic delocalization of electrons; metallic carbon nanotubes are one example. Transition metals and intermetallic compounds based on transition metals can exhibit mixed metallic and covalent bonding, resulting in high shear strength, low ductility, and elevated melting points; a classic example is tungsten.\n\nMaterials can be intermediate between molecular and network covalent solids either because of the intermediate organization of their covalent bonds, or because the bonds themselves are of an intermediate kind.\n\nIntermediate organization of covalent bonds:\n\nRegarding the organization of covalent bonds, recall that classic molecular solids, as stated above, consist of small, non-polar covalent molecules. The example given, paraffin wax, is a member of a family of hydrocarbon molecules of differing chain lengths, with high-density polyethylene at the long-chain end of the series. High-density polyethylene can be a strong material: when the hydrocarbon chains are well aligned, the resulting fibers rival the strength of steel. The covalent bonds in this material form extended structures, but do not form a continuous network. With cross-linking, however, polymer networks can become continuous, and a series of materials spans the range from Cross-linked polyethylene, to rigid thermosetting resins, to hydrogen-rich amorphous solids, to vitreous carbon, diamond-like carbons, and ultimately to diamond itself. As this example shows, there can be no sharp boundary between molecular and network covalent solids.\n\nIntermediate kinds of bonding:\n\nA solid with extensive hydrogen bonding will be considered a molecular solid, yet strong hydrogen bonds can have a significant degree of covalent character. As noted above, covalent and ionic bonds form a continuum between shared and transferred electrons; covalent and weak bonds form a continuum between shared and unshared electrons. In addition, molecules can be polar, or have polar groups, and the resulting regions of positive and negative charge can interact to produce electrostatic bonding resembling that in ionic solids.\n\nA large molecule with an ionized group is technically an ion, but its behavior may be largely the result of non-ionic interactions. For example, sodium stearate (the main constituent of traditional soaps) consists entirely of ions, yet it is a soft material quite unlike a typical ionic solid. There is a continuum between ionic solids and molecular solids with little ionic character in their bonding.\n\nMetallic solids are bound by a high density of shared, delocalized electrons. Although weakly bound molecular components are incompatible with strong metallic bonding, low densities of shared, delocalized electrons can impart varying degrees of metallic bonding and conductivity overlaid on discrete, covalently bonded molecular units, especially in reduced-dimensional systems. Examples include charge transfer complexes.\n\nThe charged components that make up ionic solids cannot exist in the high-density sea of delocalized electrons characteristic of strong metallic bonding. Some molecular salts, however, feature both ionic bonding among molecules and substantial one-dimensional conductivity, indicating a degree of metallic bonding among structural components along the axis of conductivity. Examples include tetrathiafulvalene salts.\n\n\n"}

Borohydride is also the term used for compounds containing , for example cyanoborohydride () and triethylborohydride (B(CH)H). Borohydrides find wide use as reducing agents in organic synthesis. The most important borohydrides are lithium borohydride and sodium borohydride, but other salts are well known (see Table). Tetrahydroborates are also of academic and industrial interest in inorganic chemistry.\n\nAlkali metal borohydrides were first described in 1940 by Hermann Irving Schlesinger and Herbert C. Brown. They synthesized lithium borohydride (LiBH) from diborane (BH):\n\nCurrent methods involve reduction of trimethyl borate with sodium hydride.\n\nIn the borohydride anion and most of its modifications, boron has a tetrahedral structure. The reactivity of the B−H bonds depends on the other ligands. Electron-releasing ethyl groups as in triethylborohydride render the B−H center highly nucleophilic. In contrast, cyanoborohydride is a weaker reductant owing to the electron-withdrawing cyano substituent. The countercation also influences the reducing power of the reagent.\n\nSodium borohydride is the borohydride that is produced on the largest scale industrially, estimated at 5000 tons/y in 2002. The main use is for the reduction of sulfur dioxide to give sodium dithionite:\nDithionite is used to bleach wood pulp. Sodium borohydride is also used to reduce aldehydes and ketones in the production of pharmaceuticals including chloramphenicol, thiophenicol, vitamin A, atropine, and scopolamine, as well as many flavorings and aromas.\n\nBecause of their high hydrogen content, borohydride complexes and salts have been of interest in the context of hydrogen storage. Reminiscent of related work on ammonia borane, challenges are associated with slow kinetics and low yields of hydrogen as well as problems with regeneration of the parent borohydrides.\n\nIn its coordination complexes, the borohydride ion is bound to the metal by means of one to three bridging hydrogen atoms. In most such compounds, the ligand is bidentate. Some homoleptic borohydride complexes are volatile. One example is uranium borohydride.\n\nMetal borohydride complexes can often be prepared by a simple salt elimination reaction:\n\nSome metal tetrahydroborates transform on heating to give metal borides. When the borohydride complex is volatile, this decomposition pathway is the basis of chemical vapor deposition, a way of depositing thin films of metal borides. For example, zirconium and hafnium diborides, ZrB and HfB, can be prepared through CVD of the tetrahydroborates Zr(BH) and Hf(BH):\n\nM(BH) → MB + BH + 5 H \n\nMetal diborides find uses as coatings because of their hardness, high melting point, strength, resistance to wear and corrosion, and good electrical conductivity.\n\n"}

It is measured in length over time, such as \"mm/second\" or \"inches/second\". Among the variables affecting burn rate are pressure and temperature. Burn rate is an important parameter especially in the area of propellants because it determines the rate at which exhaust gases are generated from the burning propellant which in turn decides the rate of flow through the nozzle. The thrust generated in the rocket of missile depends on this rate of flow. Thus Knowing quantitatively the burning rate of a propellant, and how it changes under various conditions, is of fundamental importance in the successful design of a solid rocket motor. The concept of Burning rate is also relevant in case of liquid propellants. \n\nOne device for measuring burning rate is a V shaped metal channel about 1–2 feet long wherein a sample is placed, with a cross-sectional dimension of approximately 6 mm or 1/4\". The sample is ignited on one end and time is measured until the flame front gets to the other end. Burn rate (typically expressed in 'mm/s' or 'in/s') is the sample length over time at a given pressure and temperature. For solid fuel propellant, the most common method of measuring burn rate is the Crawford Type Strand Burning Rate Bomb System (also known as the Crawford Burner or Strand Burner), as described in MIL-STD-286C.\n\nA substance is characterized through burn rate vs pressure chart and burn rate vs temperature chart.\n\nHowever, there is difference in opinion in differentiating the three in absence of firm numbers at given pressure or temperature.\n"}

Because it was always considered part of the city's street system, the Cobblestone Path is owned by the City of Bardstown, even though it now serves only pedestrian traffic.\n\nThe Cobblestone Path was built in 1785. The path was built by the citizens of Bardstown. Non-minister men between the ages of 16 and 50 were forced by law to help build it and the other roads, or be forced to pay a fine of $1.25 a day when they were assigned to work, but didn't. It served as the main entryway to the town of Bardstown from 1785 to 1825, including the Wilderness Road. It was due to this importance that both the Kentucky legislature and the United States Congress paid for its improvements prior to 1800. It was briefly part of the Louisville and Nashville Turnpike as well. With the building of the turnpikes to Bloomfield, Kentucky and Springfield, Kentucky, the pathway was reduced to walkers and equestrians.\n\nThe Cobblestone Path lies on top of a bluff created by Stewart's Creek Towne Branch's deep canyon, the other side of which rests My Old Kentucky Home State Park. The remaining path is long and varies in width from twenty-eight feet to twelve feet. The dolomite limestone used to cobble the pathway are not uniformly shaped, and range from six to ten inches (254 mm) thick. Natural outcroppings of limestone and even a limestone boulder lie beside the path, some of which may serve as a bench. The top portion of the path was long a popular picnic spot from the 1870s to 1900, and gained the name Lovers Leap. Less than thirty feet below the Leap is a small dry cave almost impossible to gain access to.\n\nErosion has always been a threat to the path, with few cobblestones remaining at the bottom of the path. During the 1920s and 1930s, Mrs. Ernest Fulton planted many flowers along the path, and did her best to fight the erosion. As a result, the path has bush honeysuckle, evergreens, jonquils, and a spruce tree. With this and the natural undergrowth, vines, and native hardwoods, the path is essentially a tunnel.\n\nOn November 16, 1989 the Cobblestone Path was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, due to its importance in the history of transportation to Kentucky.\n\n"}

This type of consumer unit was very popular in Britain until 2001 when wiring regulations mandated residual current device (RCD) protection for sockets that could \"reasonably be expected to\" supply outdoor equipment (BS7671:2001, ). There were a number of similar designs from other manufacturers but the Wylex ones are by far the most commonly encountered and the only ones for which fuseholders/breakers are still commonly available.\n\nSome manufacturers have added innovative features such as CPN Cudis who have added a LED strip light to their 'Lumo' consumer unit to enhance visibility in dark locations such as under staircases.\n\nWith the introduction of the recent (BS 7671:2008 incorporating amendment no 1: 2011) 17th Edition IET Wiring Regulations consumer units in the UK must provide RCD protection to all cables embedded in walls excepting high integrity circuits such as those for burglar alarms or smoke alarms.\n\nConsumer units have different methods of protecting circuits. A dual split-load consumer unit can be arranged as follows:\n\nRCD 1\n\n\nRCD 2\n\n\nBy alternating the circuits like this, power will always be present on one floor if either RCD trips out.\n\nAnother way to protect circuits under the 17th Edition IET Wiring Regulations is by fitting Residual Current Circuit Breaker With Overload (RCBOs) to every circuit although this can be a very costly method.\n\nSome older systems such as those that use MK or old MEM Consumer Units that had one fuse per spur, so for instance:\n\netc..\n"}

A note on notation: in this article, we denote projection maps by their domains, e.g., \"π\" : \"TTM\" → \"TM\". Some authors index these maps by their ranges instead, so for them, that map would be written \"π\".\n\nThe second tangent bundle arises in the study of connections and second order ordinary differential equations, i.e., (semi)spray structures on smooth manifolds, and it is not to be confused with the second order jet bundle.\n\nSince is a vector bundle on its own right, its tangent bundle has the secondary vector bundle structure where is the push-forward of the canonical projection \nIn the following we denote\n\nand apply the associated coordinate system\n\non \"TM\". Then the fibre of the secondary vector bundle structure at \"X\"∈\"T\"\"M\" takes the form\n\nThe double tangent bundle is a double vector bundle.\n\nThe canonical flip is a smooth involution \"j\":\"TTM\"→\"TTM\" that exchanges these vector space structures\nin the sense that it is a vector bundle isomorphism between and In the associated coordinates on \"TM\" it reads as\n\nThe canonical flip has the property that for any \"f\": R → \"M\", \nwhere \"s\" and \"t\" are coordinates of the standard basis of R . Note that both partial derivatives are functions from R to \"TTM\".\n\nThis property can, in fact, be used to give an intrinsic definition of the canonical flip. Indeed, there is a submersion\n\"p\": J (R,M) → \"TTM\" given by \nwhere \"p\" can be defined in the space of two-jets at zero because only depends on \"f\" up to order two at zero. We consider the application:\nwhere α(\"s\",\"t\")= (\"t\",\"s\"). Then \"J\" is compatible with the projection \"p\" and induces the canonical flip on the quotient \"TTM\".\n\nAs for any vector bundle, the tangent spaces of the fibres \"T\"\"M\" of the tangent bundle can be identified with the fibres \"T\"\"M\" themselves. Formally this is achieved though the vertical lift, which is a natural vector space isomorphism\n\nThe vertical lift can also be seen as a natural vector bundle isomorphism\n\nfrom the pullback bundle of over onto the vertical tangent bundle\n\nThe vertical lift lets us define the canonical vector field\n\nwhich is smooth in the slit tangent bundle \"TM\"\\0. The canonical vector field can be also defined as the infinitesimal generator of the Lie-group action\n\nUnlike the canonical vector field, which can be defined for any vector bundle, the canonical endomorphism\n\nis special to the tangent bundle. The canonical endomorphism \"J\" satisfies\n\nand it is also known as the tangent structure for the following reason. If (\"E\",\"p\",\"M\") is any vector bundle\nwith the canonical vector field \"V\" and a (1,1)-tensor field \"J\" that satisfies the properties listed above, with \"VE\" in place of \"VTM\", then the vector bundle (\"E\",\"p\",\"M\") is isomorphic to the tangent bundle of the base manifold, and \"J\" corresponds to the tangent structure of \"TM\" in this isomorphism.\n\nThere is also a stronger result of this kind which states that if \"N\" is a 2\"n\"-dimensional manifold and if there exists a (1,1)-tensor field \"J\" on \"N\" that satisfies\n\nthen \"N\" is diffeomorphic to an open set of the total space of a tangent bundle of some \"n\"-dimensional manifold \"M\", and \"J\" corresponds to the tangent structure of \"TM\" in this diffeomorphism.\n\nIn any associated coordinate system on \"TM\" the canonical vector field and the canonical endomorphism have the coordinate representations\n\nA Semispray structure on a smooth manifold \"M\" is by definition a smooth vector field \"H\" on \"TM\" \\0 such that \"JH\"=\"V\". An equivalent definition is that \"j\"(\"H\")=\"H\", where \"j\":\"TTM\"→\"TTM\" is the canonical flip. A semispray \"H\" is a spray, if in addition, [\"V\",\"H\"]=\"H\".\n\nSpray and semispray structures are invariant versions of second order ordinary differential equations on \"M\". The difference between spray and semispray structures is that the solution curves of sprays are invariant in positive reparametrizations as point sets on \"M\", whereas solution curves of semisprays typically are not.\n\nThe canonical flip makes it possible to define nonlinear covariant derivatives on smooth manifolds as follows. Let\nbe an Ehresmann connection on the slit tangent bundle \"TM\"/0 and consider the mapping\nwhere \"Y\":\"TM\"→\"TTM\" is the push-forward, \"j\":\"TTM\"→\"TTM\" is the canonical flip and κ:\"T\"(\"TM\"/0)→\"TM\"/0 is the connector map. The mapping \"D\" is a derivation in the module Γ (\"TM\") of smooth vector fields on \"M\" in the sense that\n\n\nAny mapping \"D\" with these properties is called a (nonlinear) covariant derivative\nThe term \"nonlinear\" refers to the fact that this kind of covariant derivative \"D\" on is not necessarily linear with respect to the direction \"X\"∈\"TM\"/0 of the differentiation.\n\nLooking at the local representations one can confirm that the Ehresmann connections on (\"TM\"/0,π,\"M\") and nonlinear covariant derivatives on \"M\" are in one-to-one correspondence. Furthermore, if \"D\" is linear in \"X\", then the Ehresmann connection is linear in the secondary vector bundle structure, and \"D\" coincides with its linear covariant derivative.\n\n"}

Such materials are now classified under \"electroceramics\", as distinguished from other functional ceramics such as advanced structural ceramics.\n\nHistorically, developments in the various subclasses of electroceramics have paralleled the growth of new technologies. Examples include: ferroelectrics - high dielectric capacitors, non-volatile memories; ferrites - data and information storage; solid electrolytes - energy storage and conversion; piezoelectrics - sonar; semiconducting oxides - environmental monitoring.

{"id": "216650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216650", "title": "Ferrimagnetism", "text": "Ferrimagnetism\n\nIn physics, a ferrimagnetic material is one that has populations of atoms with opposing magnetic moments, as in antiferromagnetism; however, in ferrimagnetic materials, the opposing moments are unequal and a spontaneous magnetization remains. This happens when the populations consist of different materials or ions (such as Fe and Fe).\n\nFerrimagnetism is exhibited by ferrites and magnetic garnets. The oldest known magnetic substance, magnetite (iron(II,III) oxide; FeO), is a ferrimagnet; it was originally classified as a ferromagnet before Néel's discovery of ferrimagnetism and antiferromagnetism in 1948.\n\nKnown ferrimagnetic materials include YIG (yttrium iron garnet), cubic ferrites composed of iron oxides and other elements such as aluminum, cobalt, nickel, manganese and zinc, hexagonal ferrites such as PbFeO and BaFeO, and pyrrhotite, FeS.\n\nFerrimagnetic materials are like ferromagnets in that they hold a spontaneous magnetization below the Curie temperature and show no magnetic order (are paramagnetic) above this temperature. However, there is sometimes a temperature \"below\" the Curie temperature, at which the two opposing moments are equal, resulting in a net magnetic moment of zero; this is called the \"magnetization compensation point\". This compensation point is observed easily in garnets and rare-earth–transition-metal alloys (RE-TM). Furthermore, ferrimagnets may also have an \"angular-momentum compensation point\", at which the net angular momentum vanishes. This compensation point is a crucial point for achieving high speed magnetization reversal in magnetic memory devices.\n\nFerrimagnetic materials have high resistivity and have anisotropic properties. The anisotropy is actually induced by an external applied field. When this applied field aligns with the magnetic dipoles, it causes a net magnetic dipole moment and causes the magnetic dipoles to precess at a frequency controlled by the applied field, called \"Larmor\" or \"precession frequency\". As a particular example, a microwave signal circularly polarized in the same direction as this precession strongly interacts with the magnetic dipole moments; when it is polarized in the opposite direction, the interaction is very low. When the interaction is strong, the microwave signal can pass through the material. This directional property is used in the construction of microwave devices like isolators, circulators and gyrators. Ferrimagnetic materials are also used to produce optical isolators and circulators. Ferrimagnetic minerals in various rock types are used to study ancient geomagnetic properties of Earth and other planets. That field of study is known as paleomagnetism.\n\nFerrimagnetism can also occur in molecular magnets. A classic example is a dodecanuclear manganese molecule with an effective spin \"S\" = 10 derived from antiferromagnetic interaction on Mn(IV) metal centres with Mn(III) and Mn(II) metal centres.\n\n"}

The Stilo three door and five door were launched in November 2001, at the Bologna Motor Show, to replace the Fiat Bravo/Brava, with the Stilo MultiWagon following in January 2003. \n\nThe Fiat Bravo was the successor of the Stilo in most markets, however, the five door Stilo continued to be manufactured in Brazil until December 2010, when it was replaced by the Bravo. The Stilo came in third place in the European Car of the Year awards for 2002, behind the Peugeot 307 and Renault Laguna.\n\nThe Stilo's styling received mixed reviews, with many journalists and enthusiasts criticising it as being too bland and too German looking, as the styling of the preceding Bravo and Brava had been criticised for being too \"Italian\". Critics also attacked the car's excessive weight and its semi independent rear torsion beam suspension / twist-beam rear suspension, however, this was the same system used by the market leading Volkswagen Golf of the time. \n\nSome saw the torsion beam as a step backwards from the acclaimed fully independent rear suspension used in the Bravo/Brava and Fiat Coupe. However, when pushed the Stilo resists understeer, although arguably its soft spring and damper rates dull the experience. \n\nThe engine range, particularly the 1.2 litre petrol, was also generally criticised for being underpowered. However the 1.6 version is the last iteration of the old Fiat 128 SOHC engine which provided strong performance. The car's fuel economy was also seen as poor for its class, a result of the car's weight. Another point of criticism was the Selespeed gearbox fitted to the Abarth version, this was seen as too slow in its reactions and particularly inappropriate for this high powered version. Nevertheless, the car won praise for its high levels of grip (aided by the unusually wide tires) and its brakes. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, different trim levels available were: Active, Active Aircon, Blue, Dynamic, Sporting, Abarth, GT, Prestigio, Xbox limited edition, Michael Schumacher and the Schumacher GP, with general modifications by British car specialists, Prodrive.\n\nThe Stilo was the second car worldwide to use the TRW Column-Drive Electric Power Assisted Steering (EPS) technology after the second generation Fiat Punto, later introduced on the 2003 Nissan Micra and Renault Mégane. As the model range aged, the range of available options was reduced. \n\nThe Stilo was originally offered in some markets with a radar assisted cruise control option; it included sensors in the front bumper and rear of the car to adjust the speed of the car according to other vehicles' speed. This was soon dropped as it became apparent that interference was creating undesired results. \n\nA keyless entry, named 'Easy Go', push button start, similar in function to Citroën's, Mercedes-Benz's and BMW Mini's systems, was also an available option. For MY2006 in September 2005, the Stilo was updated with a new front grille, different seat fabric, a relocation of the electric mirror controls from the window control console to just behind the gear stick. \n\nThe entry models also had the centre arm rest removed (which when in the downward position prevented comfortable use of the handbrake as in the Audi A3) and the deletion of the rear air vent.\n\nThe Stilo was ultimately a sales disappointment. An extensive advertising campaign using Formula 1 stars Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello did little to aid the car's sales. In October 2013, \"The Economist\" placed the Stilo into the report on \"Europe's Biggest Loss Making Cars\". \n\nIn 2004, the 1242 cc engine was dropped in favour of the Punto's 1.4 L unit, increasing the car's power to 95 bhp (71 kW), again combined with the six-speed gearbox. Also, the tail lights were altered, and the Abarth version gained a manual gearbox, instead of the \"Selespeed\".\n\nThe original engine and gearbox combinations were:\n\nThe Fiat Stilo passed the Euro NCAP car safety tests, with following ratings:\nA Group N version of the car was developed by Abarth to compete in the single make trophy called Trofeo Stilo Abarth, held in Italy from 2002 to 2005. The car was revealed in November 2001, at the Bologna Motor Show. \n\nIt was derived from the Stilo 1.8 16v version, with the engine power increased from to , and from the 2003 season to . A similar competition was held in the United Kingdom from 2004 to 2005, called the Fiat Stilo Rally Cup.\n\nIn September 2004, a junior team backed up by Fiat UK competed in the Wales Rally GB of the World Rally Championship with group A cars, and the following year two other cars took part in the rally. Stilo cars have also been present in the Andros Trophy during the last years.\n\nOnly available in the five door hatchback version, the Stilo was launched in South America in 2003, being assembled in Brazil. The engines were the Family I GM engines 1.8 L with eight valve (103 hp) and 16 valve (122 hp) versions, and a 2.4 twenty valve version (170 hp) for the Abarth model as well. For export, the chosen engines were the Italian made 1.8 16v VIS engine with and the 1.9 JTD Diesel of specially for Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. (Chile did not get the JTD, but was the only country in the region to receive the Italian three door version, and the MultiWagon version.)\n\nA Schumacher special edition of the Stilo was added in 2004 and lasted until 2006; contrary to the European version, which was based on the three door version and equipped with the 2.4 twenty valve engine, the Brazilian was only available with five doors and the Family I GM 1.8 16v engine with . In 2006, the Stilo gained a GM sourced flexible engine capable of using petrol and ethanol (1.8 8v with on petrol and with ethanol) and the 1.8 16v engine was retired.\n\nIn the Americas, the Stilo was partially replaced by the new Bravo in the end of 2010, when it will be built in Brazil; from 2007 on the Italian import is available in Chile and Venezuela.\n\nFiat Automóveis introduced a facelifted Stilo in the end of January 2008, in which the Dualogic manual robotized gearbox was released, being available to every version with the 1.8 8v Flex engine, which now produces (petrol) or when using ethanol as fuel. The car also got minor cosmetic changes to front grille, bonnet, side bumpers and to the taillights, in order to end its production cycle, which is expected to happen in 2010.\n\nFor the MY2009, Fiat withdrew the Abarth version from the Brazilian market; the version wasn't available in other markets anymore.\n\nFor the MY2010, Fiat do Brasil launched a \"basic features\" versión called \"Attractive\", still with the 1.8 8v Flex engine. This version marks the confirmation that the new Bravo is coming, with the Stilo Attractive as the only version.\n\nIn March 2010, Brazil's Justice Ministry fined Fiat three million Reais (US$ 1.7 million) for failing to recall its Stilo without ABS brakes to fix a rear wheel problem that may have caused thirty accidents and eight deaths. Fiat denied any wrongdoing, saying that the rear wheel problem was not the cause of the accidents, but rather caused by them.\n"}

It is closely related with ecological economics, but has a more politically applied focus. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report argues \"that to be green, an economy must not only be efficient, but also fair. Fairness implies recognising global and country level equity dimensions, particularly in assuring a just transition to an economy that is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive.\"\n\nA feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of natural capital and ecological services as having economic value (\"see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity and Bank of Natural Capital\") and a full cost accounting regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to, and accounted for as liabilities of, the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset.\n\nGreen Sticker and ecolabel practices have emerged as consumer facing measurements of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development. Many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a viable way to promote their greening practices in a globalizing economy.\n\n\"Green economics\" is loosely defined as any theory of economics by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides (after Lynn Margulis). A holistic approach to the subject is typical, such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects, depending on the particular theorist. Proponents of feminism, postmodernism, the environmental movement, peace movement, Green politics, green anarchism and anti-globalization movement have used the term to describe very different ideas, all external to mainstream economics.\n\nThe use of the term is further ambiguated by the political distinction of Green parties which are formally organized and claim the capital-G \"Green\" term as a unique and distinguishing mark. It is thus preferable to refer to a loose school of \"'green economists\"' who generally advocate shifts towards a green economy, biomimicry and a fuller accounting for biodiversity. (\"see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity especially for current authoritative international work towards these goals and Bank of Natural Capital for a layperson's presentation of these.\")\n\nSome economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools. For instance, it is regarded as classical economics where the traditional land is generalized to natural capital and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital (since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for man-made ones such as canals). Or, it is viewed as Marxist economics with nature represented as a form of Lumpenproletariat, an exploited base of non-human workers providing surplus value to the human economy, or as a branch of neoclassical economics in which the price of life for developing vs. developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non-human life is very low.\n\nAn increasing commitment by the UNEP (and national governments such as the UK) to the ideas of natural capital and full cost accounting under the banner 'green economy' could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of \"green economics\". As of 2010 the Bretton Woods institutions (notably the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (via its \"Green Fund\" initiative) responsible for global monetary policy have stated a clear intention to move towards biodiversity valuation and a more official and universal biodiversity finance.\nTaking these into account targeting not less but radically zero emission and waste is what is promoted by the Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives. The UNEP 2011 Green Economy Report informs that \"based on existing studies, the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range US$ 1.05 to US$ 2.59 trillion. To place this demand in perspective, it is about one-tenth of total global investment per year, as measured by global Gross Capital Formation.\" \n\nKarl Burkart defines a green economy as based on six main sectors:\n\nThe International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) representing global business defines green economy as “an economy in which economic growth and environmental responsibility work together in a mutually reinforcing fashion while supporting progress on social development”.\n\nIn 2012, the ICC published the Green Economy Roadmap, containing contributions from experts from around the globe brought together in a two-year consultation process. The Roadmap represents a comprehensive and multidisciplinary effort to clarify and frame the concept of “green economy”. It highlights the essential role of business in bringing solutions to common global challenges. It sets out the following 10 conditions which relate to business/intra-industry and collaborative action for a transition towards a green economy:\n\n\nMeasuring economic output and progress is done through the use of economic index indicators. Green indices emerged from the need to measure human ecological impact, efficiency sectors like transport, energy, buildings and tourism, as well as the investment flows targeted to areas like renewable energy and cleantech innovation. \n\nEcological footprint measurements are a way to gauge anthropogenic impact and are another standard used by municipal governments.\n\nGreen economies require green energy generation based on renewable energy to replace fossil fuels as well as energy conservation and efficient energy use.\n\nThere is justification for market failure to respond to environmental protection and climate protection needs with the excuse that high external costs and high initial costs for research, development, and marketing of green energy sources and green products prevents firms from voluntarily reducing their ecological footprints. The green economy may need government subsidies as market incentives to motivate firms to invest and produce green products and services. The German Renewable Energy Act, legislations of many other member states of the European Union and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, all provide such market incentives. However, other experts argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer.\n\nA number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the 'Green Economy', particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using price mechanisms to protect nature, arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. The research organisation ETC Group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio-economy \"will spur even greater convergence of corporate power and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than 500 years.\" Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP's report, \"Towards a Green Economy\", while well-intentioned \"ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets – even when a large majority of the population call for them – is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations.\" Ulrich Hoffmann, in a paper for UNCTAD also says that the focus on Green Economy and \"green growth\" in particular, \"based on an evolutionary (and often reductionist) approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate\nchange\" and \"may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can\nbring about a U-turn of global greenhouse gas emissions. Clive Spash, an ecological economist, has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses, and argued that the Green Economy, as advocated by the UN, is not a new approach at all and is actually a diversion from the real drivers of environmental crisis. He has also criticised the UN's project on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity (TEEB), and the basis for valuing ecosystems services in monetary terms.\n\n"}

This includes changes to the object's speed, or direction of motion. \n\nAn aspect of this property is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at a constant speed, when no forces are upon them—and this aspect in particular is also called inertia.\n\nThe principle of inertia is one of the fundamental principles in classical physics that are still used today to describe the motion of objects and how they are affected by the applied forces on them. \n\nInertia comes from the Latin word, \"iners\", meaning idle, sluggish. Inertia is one of the primary manifestations of mass, which is a quantitative property of physical systems. Isaac Newton defined inertia as his first law in his \"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", which states: \n\nIn common usage, the term \"inertia\" may refer to an object's \"amount of resistance to change in velocity\" (which is quantified by its mass), or sometimes to its momentum, depending on the context. The term \"inertia\" is more properly understood as shorthand for \"the principle of inertia\" as described by Newton in his First Law of Motion: an object not subject to any net external force moves at a constant velocity. Thus, an object will continue moving at its current velocity until some force causes its speed or direction to change.\n\nOn the surface of the Earth, inertia is often masked by the effects of friction and air resistance, both of which tend to decrease the speed of moving objects (commonly to the point of rest), and gravity. This misled the philosopher Aristotle to believe that objects would move only as long as force was applied to them:\n\nPrior to the Renaissance, the most generally accepted theory of motion in Western philosophy was based on Aristotle who around about 335 BC to 322 BC said that, in the absence of an external motive power, all objects (on Earth) would come to rest and that moving objects only continue to move so long as there is a power inducing them to do so. Aristotle explained the continued motion of projectiles, which are separated from their projector, by the action of the surrounding medium, which continues to move the projectile in some way. Aristotle concluded that such violent motion in a void was impossible.\n\nDespite its general acceptance, Aristotle's concept of motion was disputed on several occasions by notable philosophers over nearly two millennia. For example, Lucretius (following, presumably, Epicurus) stated that the \"default state\" of matter was motion, not stasis. In the 6th century, John Philoponus criticized the inconsistency between Aristotle's discussion of projectiles, where the medium keeps projectiles going, and his discussion of the void, where the medium would hinder a body's motion. Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of a surrounding medium, but by some property imparted to the object when it was set in motion. Although this was not the modern concept of inertia, for there was still the need for a power to keep a body in motion, it proved a fundamental step in that direction. This view was strongly opposed by Averroes and by many scholastic philosophers who supported Aristotle. However, this view did not go unchallenged in the Islamic world, where Philoponus did have several supporters who further developed his ideas.\n\nIn the 14th century, Jean Buridan rejected the notion that a motion-generating property, which he named \"impetus\", dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by the resistance of the air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. Buridan also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also believed that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects (such as celestial bodies) to move in a circle.\n\nBuridan's thought was followed up by his pupil Albert of Saxony (1316–1390) and the Oxford Calculators, who performed various experiments that further undermined the classical, Aristotelian view. Their work in turn was elaborated by Nicole Oresme who pioneered the practice of demonstrating laws of motion in the form of graphs.\n\nShortly before Galileo's theory of inertia, Giambattista Benedetti modified the growing theory of impetus to involve linear motion alone:\n\nBenedetti cites the motion of a rock in a sling as an example of the inherent linear motion of objects, forced into circular motion.\n\nThe principle of inertia which originated with Aristotle for \"motions in a void\" states that an object tends to resist a change in motion. According to Newton, an object will stay at rest or stay in motion (i.e. \"maintain its velocity\") unless acted on by a net external force, whether it results from gravity, friction, contact, or some other force. The Aristotelian division of motion into mundane and celestial became increasingly problematic in the face of the conclusions of Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century, who argued that the earth (and everything on it) was in fact never \"at rest\", but was actually in constant motion around the sun. Galileo, in his further development of the Copernican model, recognized these problems with the then-accepted nature of motion and, at least partially as a result, included a restatement of Aristotle's description of motion in a void as a basic physical principle:\n\nA body moving on a level surface will continue in the same direction at a constant speed unless disturbed. \n\nGalileo writes that \"all external impediments removed, a heavy body on a spherical surface concentric with the earth will maintain itself in that state in which it has been; if placed in movement towards the west (for example), it will maintain itself in that movement.\" This notion which is termed \"circular inertia\" or \"horizontal circular inertia\" by historians of science, is a precursor to, but distinct from, Newton's notion of rectilinear inertia. For Galileo, a motion is \"horizontal\" if it does not carry the moving body towards or away from the centre of the earth, and for him, \"a ship, for instance, having once received some impetus through the tranquil sea, would move continually around our globe without ever stopping.\"\n\nIt is also worth noting that Galileo later (in 1632) concluded that based on this initial premise of inertia, it is impossible to tell the difference between a moving object and a stationary one without some outside reference to compare it against. This observation ultimately came to be the basis for Einstein to develop the theory of Special Relativity.\n\nThe first physicist to completely break away from the Aristotelian model of motion was Isaac Beeckman in 1614.\n\nConcepts of inertia in Galileo's writings would later come to be refined, modified and codified by Isaac Newton as the first of his Laws of Motion (first published in Newton's work, \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", in 1687):\n\nUnless acted upon by a net unbalanced force, an object will maintain a constant velocity.\n\nNote that \"velocity\" in this context is defined as a vector, thus Newton's \"constant velocity\" implies both constant speed and constant direction (and also includes the case of zero speed, or no motion). Since initial publication, Newton's Laws of Motion (and by inclusion, this first law) have come to form the basis for the branch of physics known as classical mechanics.\n\nThe term \"inertia\" was first introduced by Johannes Kepler in his \"Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae\" (published in three parts from 1617–1621); however, the meaning of Kepler's term (which he derived from the Latin word for \"idleness\" or \"laziness\") was not quite the same as its modern interpretation. Kepler defined inertia only in terms of a resistance to movement, once again based on the presumption that rest was a natural state which did not need explanation. It was not until the later work of Galileo and Newton unified rest and motion in one principle that the term \"inertia\" could be applied to these concepts as it is today.\n\nNevertheless, despite defining the concept so elegantly in his laws of motion, even Newton did not actually use the term \"inertia\" to refer to his First Law. In fact, Newton originally viewed the phenomenon he described in his First Law of Motion as being caused by \"innate forces\" inherent in matter, which resisted any acceleration. Given this perspective, and borrowing from Kepler, Newton attributed the term \"inertia\" to mean \"the innate force possessed by an object which resists changes in motion\"; thus, Newton defined \"inertia\" to mean the cause of the phenomenon, rather than the phenomenon itself. However, Newton's original ideas of \"innate resistive force\" were ultimately problematic for a variety of reasons, and thus most physicists no longer think in these terms. As no alternate mechanism has been readily accepted, and it is now generally accepted that there may not be one which we can know, the term \"inertia\" has come to mean simply the phenomenon itself, rather than any inherent mechanism. Thus, ultimately, \"inertia\" in modern classical physics has come to be a name for the same phenomenon described by Newton's First Law of Motion, and the two concepts are now considered to be equivalent.\n\nAlbert Einstein's theory of special relativity, as proposed in his 1905 paper entitled \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\" was built on the understanding of inertia and inertial reference frames developed by Galileo and Newton. While this revolutionary theory did significantly change the meaning of many Newtonian concepts such as mass, energy, and distance, Einstein's concept of inertia remained unchanged from Newton's original meaning (in fact, the entire theory was based on Newton's definition of inertia). However, this resulted in a limitation inherent in special relativity: the principle of relativity could only apply to reference frames that were \"inertial\" in nature (meaning when no acceleration was present). In an attempt to address this limitation, Einstein proceeded to develop his general theory of relativity (\"The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity,\" 1916), which ultimately provided a unified theory for both \"inertial\" and \"noninertial\" (accelerated) reference frames. However, in order to accomplish this, in general relativity, Einstein found it necessary to redefine several fundamental concepts (such as gravity) in terms of a new concept of \"curvature\" of space-time, instead of the more traditional system of forces understood by Newton.\n\nAs a result of this redefinition, Einstein also redefined the concept of \"inertia\" in terms of geodesic deviation instead, with some subtle but significant additional implications. The result of this is that, according to general relativity, inertia is the gravitational coupling between matter and spacetime.\n\nWhen dealing with very large scales, the traditional Newtonian idea of \"inertia\" does not actually apply and cannot necessarily be relied upon. Luckily, for sufficiently small regions of spacetime, the special theory can be used and \"inertia\" still means the same (and works the same) as in the classical model.\n\nAnother profound conclusion of the theory of special relativity—perhaps the most well known—was that energy and mass are not separate things but are, in fact, interchangeable. But this new relationship also carried with it new implications for the concept of inertia. The logical conclusion of special relativity was that if mass exhibits the principle of inertia, then inertia must also apply to energy. This theory, and subsequent experiments confirming some of its conclusions, have also served to radically expand the meaning of inertia to apply more widely and to include inertia of energy.\n\nPhysicists and mathematicians appear to be less inclined to use the popular concept of inertia as \"a tendency to maintain momentum\" and instead favor the mathematically useful definition of inertia as the measure of a body's resistance to changes in velocity or simply a body's inertial mass.\n\nThis was clear at the beginning of the 20th century, before the advent of the theory of relativity. Mass, \"m\", denoted something like an amount of substance or quantity of matter. At the same time, mass was the quantitative measure of inertia of a body.\n\nThe mass of a body determines the momentum, formula_1, of the body at given velocity, formula_2; it is a proportionality factor in the formula:\n\nThe factor \"m\" is referred to as inertial mass.\n\nBut mass, as related to the \"inertia\" of a body, can also be defined by the formula:\n\nwhere \"F\" is the force, \"m\" is the inertial mass, and \"a\" is the acceleration.\n\nBy this formula, the greater its mass, the less a body accelerates under a given force. The masses defined by the above formulas are equal because the latter formula is a consequence of the former, if mass does not depend on time and velocity. Thus, \"mass is the quantitative or numerical measure of a body’s inertia, that is of its resistance to being accelerated\".\n\nThis meaning of a \"body's inertia\" therefore is altered from the popular meaning as \"a tendency to maintain momentum\" to a description of the measure of how difficult it is to change the velocity of a body, but it is consistent with the fact that motion in one reference frame can disappear in another, so it is the change in velocity that is important.\n\nThere is no measurable difference between gravitational mass and inertial mass. The gravitational mass is defined by the quantity of gravitational field material a mass possesses, including its energy. The \"inertial mass\" (relativistic mass) is a function of the acceleration a mass has undergone and its resultant speed. A mass that has been accelerated to speeds close to the speed of light has its \"relativistic mass\" increased, and that is why the magnetic field strength in particle accelerators must be increased to force the mass's path to curve. In practice, \"inertial mass\" is normally taken to be \"invariant mass\" and so is identical to gravitational mass without the energy component.\n\nGravitational mass is measured by comparing the force of gravity of an unknown mass to the force of gravity of a known mass. This is typically done with some sort of balance. Equal masses will match on a balance because the gravitational field applies to them equally, producing identical weight. This assumption breaks down near supermassive objects such as black holes and neutron stars due to tidal effects. It also breaks down in weightless environments, because no matter what objects are compared, it will yield a balanced reading.\n\nInertial mass is found by applying a known net force to an unknown mass, measuring the resulting acceleration, and applying Newton's Second Law, formula_5. This gives an accurate value for mass, limited only by the accuracy of the measurements. When astronauts need to be measured in the weightlessness of free fall, they actually find their inertial mass in a special chair called a body mass measurement device (BMMD).\n\nAt high speeds, and especially near the speed of light (formula_6), inertial mass can be determined by measuring the magnetic field strength and the curvature of the path of an electrically-charged mass such as an electron.\n\nNo physical difference has been found between gravitational and inertial mass in a given inertial frame. In experimental measurements, the two always agree within the margin of error for the experiment. Einstein used the fact that gravitational and inertial mass were equal to begin his general theory of relativity, in which he postulated that gravitational mass was the same as inertial mass, and that the acceleration of gravity is a result of a \"valley\" or slope in the space-time continuum that masses \"fell down\". Dennis Sciama later showed that the reaction force produced by the combined gravity of all matter in the universe upon an accelerating object is mathematically equal to the object's inertia, but this would only be a workable physical explanation if, by some mechanism, the gravitational effects operated instantaneously.\n\nAt any non-zero speed, relativistic mass always exceeds gravitational mass. If the mass is made to travel close to the speed of light, its \"inertial mass\" (relativistic) as observed from a stationary frame would be very great while its gravitational mass would remain at its rest value, but the gravitational effect of the extra energy would exactly balance the measured increase in inertial mass.\n\nIn a location such as a steadily moving railway carriage, a dropped ball (as seen by an observer in the carriage) would behave as it would if it were dropped in a stationary carriage. The ball would simply descend vertically. It is possible to ignore the motion of the carriage by defining it as an inertial frame. In a moving but non-accelerating frame, the ball behaves normally because the train and its contents continue to move at a constant velocity. Before being dropped, the ball was traveling with the train at the same speed, and the ball's inertia ensured that it continued to move in the same speed and direction as the train, even while dropping. Note that, here, it is inertia which ensured that, not its mass.\n\nIn an inertial frame, all the observers in uniform (non-accelerating) motion will observe the same laws of physics. However, observers in another inertial frame can make a simple, and intuitively obvious, transformation (the Galilean transformation), to convert their observations. Thus, an observer from outside the moving train could deduce that the dropped ball within the carriage fell vertically downwards.\n\nHowever, in reference frames which are experiencing acceleration (non-inertial reference frames), objects appear to be affected by fictitious forces. For example, if the railway carriage were accelerating, the ball would not fall vertically within the carriage but would appear to an observer to be deflected because the carriage and the ball would not be traveling at the same speed while the ball was falling. Other examples of fictitious forces occur in rotating frames such as the earth. For example, a missile at the North Pole could be aimed directly at a location and fired southwards. An observer would see it apparently deflected away from its target by a force (the Coriolis force), but in reality, the southerly target has moved because earth has rotated while the missile is in flight. Because the earth is rotating, a useful inertial frame of reference is defined by the stars, which only move imperceptibly during most observations. Newton's first law of motion is known as the principle of inertia.\n\nIn summary, the principle of inertia is intimately linked with the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\nAnother form of inertia is \"rotational inertia\" (→ moment of inertia), the property that a rotating rigid body maintains its state of uniform rotational motion. Its angular momentum is unchanged, unless an external torque is applied; this is also called conservation of angular momentum. Rotational inertia depends on the object remaining structurally intact as a rigid body, and also has practical consequences. For example, a gyroscope uses the property that it resists any change in the axis of rotation.\n\nA gas or liquid in a container will also resist changes in rotational rate.\n\n\n\n"}

He was Professor of Anatomy and Chemistry at the University of Glasgow for 10 years from 1756, and then Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh from 1766, teaching and lecturing there for more than 30 years.\n\nThe chemistry buildings at both the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow are named after Black.\n\nBlack was born in Bordeaux, France, the sixth of the 12 children of Margaret Gordon (\"d\". 1747) and John Black. His mother was from an Aberdeenshire family that had connections with the wine business and his father was from Belfast, Ireland and worked as a factor in the wine trade. He was educated at home until the age of 12, after which he attended grammar school in Belfast. In 1746 at the age of 18 he entered the University of Glasgow, studying there for four years before spending another four at the University of Edinburgh, furthering his medical studies. During his studies he wrote a doctorate thesis on the treatment of kidney stones with the salt magnesium carbonate.\n\nLike most 18th-century experimentalists, Black's conceptualisation of chemistry was based on five 'principles' of matter: Water, Salt, Earth, Fire and Metal. He added the principle of 'Air' when his experiments definitely confirmed the presence of carbon dioxide, which he called 'fixed air'. Black's research was guided by questions relating to how the 'principles' combined with each other in various different forms and mixtures. He used the term 'affinity' to describe the force that held such combinations together. Throughout his career he used a variety of diagrams and formulas to teach his University of Edinburgh students how to manipulate 'affinity' through different kinds of experimentation.\n\nIn about 1750, while still a student, Black developed the analytical balance based on a light-weight beam balanced on a wedge-shaped fulcrum. Each arm carried a pan on which the sample or standard weights was placed. It far exceeded the accuracy of any other balance of the time and became an important scientific instrument in most chemistry laboratories.\n\nIn 1757, Black was appointed Regius Professor of the Practice of Medicine at the University of Glasgow.\n\nIn 1761 he deduced that the application of heat to ice at its melting point does not cause a rise in temperature of the ice/water mixture, but rather an increase in the amount of water in the mixture. Additionally, Black observed that the application of heat to boiling water does not result in a rise in temperature of a water/steam mixture, but rather an increase in the amount of steam. From these observations, he concluded that the heat applied must have combined with the ice particles and boiling water and become latent.\n\nThe theory of latent heat marks the beginning of thermodynamics. Black's theory of latent heat was one of his more-important scientific contributions, and one on which his scientific fame chiefly rests. He also showed that different substances have different specific heats.\n\nThe theory ultimately proved important not only in the development of abstract science but in the development of the steam engine. The latent heat of water is large compared with many other liquids, so giving impetus to James Watt's attempts to improve the efficiency of the steam engine invented by Thomas Newcomen. Black and Watt became friends after meeting around 1757 while both were at Glasgow. Black provided significant financing and other support for Watt's early research in steam power.\n\nBlack also explored the properties of a gas produced in various reactions. He found that limestone (calcium carbonate) could be heated or treated with acids to yield a gas he called \"fixed air.\" He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and did not support either flame or animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through an aqueous solution of lime (calcium hydroxide), it would precipitate calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation.\n\nIn 1766, treading in the footsteps of his friend and former teacher at the University of Glasgow, Black succeeded William Cullen as Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh (Cullen had moved to Edinburgh in 1755). His position at Glasgow University was filled by Alexander Stevenson.\n\nAt this point he gave up research and devoted himself exclusively to teaching. In this he was successful with audience attendance at his lectures increasing from year to year for more than thirty years. His lectures had a powerful effect in popularising chemistry and attendance at them even came to be a fashionable amusement.\n\nBlack was widely recognised as one of the most popular lecturers at the University. His chemistry course regularly attracted an exceptionally high number of students, with many attending two or three times. In addition to regularly introducing cutting-edge topics and meticulously selecting visually impressive experiments, Black employed a wide array of successful teaching tools that made chemistry accessible to his students (many of whom were as young as 14 years old). His students came from across the United Kingdom, its colonies and Europe, and hundreds of them preserved his lectures in their notebooks and disseminated his ideas after they left university.\n\nOn 17 November 1783 he became one of the founders of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. From 1788 to 1790 he was President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. He was a member of the revision committee for the editions of the college's Pharmacopoeia Edinburgensis of 1774, 1783, and 1794. Black was appointed principal physician to King George III in Scotland.\n\nBlack's research and teaching were reduced as a result of poor health. From 1793 his health declined further and he gradually withdrew from his teaching duties. In 1795, Charles Hope was appointed his coadjutor in his professorship, and in 1797 he lectured for the last time.\n\nBlack was a member of The Poker Club and associated with David Hume, Adam Smith, and the literati of the Scottish Enlightenment. He was also close to pioneering geologist James Hutton.\n\nIn 1773 he is listed as living on College Wynd on the south side of the Old Town.\n\nBlack never married. He died peacefully at his home in Edinburgh in 1799 at the age of 71 and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. The large monument lies in the sealed section to the south-west known as the Covenanter's Prison.\n\nIn 2011, scientific equipment believed to belong to Black was discovered during an archaeological dig at the University of Edinburgh.\n\n\n\n"}

A Joukowsky airfoil is generated in the complex plane (formula_4-plane) by applying the Joukowsky transform to a circle in the formula_5-plane. The coordinates of the centre of the circle are variables, and varying them modifies the shape of the resulting airfoil. The circle encloses the point formula_6 (where the derivative is zero) and intersects the point formula_7 This can be achieved for any allowable centre position formula_8 by varying the radius of the circle.\n\nJoukowsky airfoils have a cusp at their trailing edge. A closely related conformal mapping, the Kármán–Trefftz transform, generates the much broader class of Kármán–Trefftz airfoils by controlling the trailing edge angle. When a trailing edge angle of zero is specified, the Kármán–Trefftz transform reduces to the Joukowsky transform.\n\nThe Joukowsky transform of any complex number formula_5 to formula_4 is as follows:\n\nSo the real (formula_12) and imaginary (formula_13) components are:\n\nThe transformation of all complex numbers on the unit circle is a special case.\n\nSo the real component becomes formula_16\nand the imaginary component becomes formula_17.\n\nThus the complex unit circle maps to a flat plate on the real-number line from −2 to +2.\n\nTransformation from other circles make a wide range of airfoil shapes.\n\nThe solution to potential flow around a circular cylinder is analytic and well known. It is the superposition of uniform flow, a doublet, and a vortex.\n\nThe complex conjugate velocity formula_18 around the circle in the formula_5-plane is\n\nwhere\n\nThe complex velocity formula_28 around the airfoil in the formula_4-plane is, according to the rules of conformal mapping and using the Joukowsky transformation:\n\nHere formula_31 with formula_32 and formula_33 the velocity components in the formula_12 and formula_13 directions, respectively (formula_36 with formula_12 and formula_13 real-valued).\nFrom this velocity, other properties of interest of the flow, such as the coefficient of pressure and lift per unit of span can be calculated.\n\nA Joukowsky airfoil has a cusp at the trailing edge.\n\nThe transformation is named after Russian scientist Nikolai Zhukovsky. His name has historically been romanized in a number of ways, thus the variation in spelling of the transform.\n\nThe Kármán–Trefftz transform is a conformal map closely related to the Joukowsky transform. While a Joukowsky airfoil has a cusped trailing edge, a Kármán–Trefftz airfoil—which is the result of the transform of a circle in the formula_5-plane to the physical formula_4-plane, analogue to the definition of the Joukowsky airfoil—has a non-zero angle at the trailing edge, between the upper and lower airfoil surface. The Kármán–Trefftz transform therefore requires an additional parameter: the trailing-edge angle formula_41 This transform is equal to:\n\nwhere formula_43 is a real constant which determines the positions where formula_44 and formula_45 is slightly smaller than 2. The angle formula_46 between the tangents of the upper and lower airfoil surface, at the trailing edge is related to formula_45 by:\n\nThe derivative formula_49, required to compute the velocity field, is equal to:\n\nFirst, add and subtract two from the Joukowsky transform, as given above:\n\nDividing the left and right hand sides gives:\n\nThe right hand side contains (as a factor) the simple second-power law from potential flow theory, applied at the trailing edge near formula_53 From conformal mapping theory this quadratic map is known to change a half plane in the formula_5-space into potential flow around a semi-infinite straight line. Further, values of the power less than two will result in flow around a finite angle. So, by changing the power in the Joukowsky transform—to a value slightly less than two—the result is a finite angle instead of a cusp. Replacing 2 by formula_45 in the previous equation gives:\n\nwhich is the Kármán–Trefftz transform. Solving for formula_4 gives it in the form of equation (A).\n\nIn 1943 Hsue-shen Tsien published a transform of a circle of radius formula_58 into a symmetrical airfoil that depends on parameter formula_59 and angle of inclination formula_60\n\nThe parameter formula_59 yields a flat plate when zero, and a circle when infinite; thus it corresponds to the thickness of the airfoil.\n\n"}

A typical lightsaber is depicted as a luminescent blade of magnetically contained plasma about in length emitted from a metal hilt around in length.\n\nThe lightsaber is the signature weapon of the Jedi Order and their Sith counterparts, both of whom can use them for melee combat, or to deflect blaster bolts. Its distinct appearance was created using rotoscoping for the original films, and with digital effects for the prequel and sequel trilogies. The lightsaber first appeared in the original 1977 film \"A New Hope\" and has since appeared in every \"Star Wars\" movie, with at least one lightsaber duel occurring in each main film installments. In 2008, a survey of approximately 2,000 film fans found it to be the most popular weapon in film history.\n\nIn its most prominent showing, the lightsaber's energy blade can cut, burn, and melt through most substances with little resistance. It leaves cauterized wounds in flesh, but can be deflected by another lightsaber blade, or by energy shields. The blade has even been used as a tool to weld metal substances. Other times, the lightsaber has been shown to cause bleeding wounds in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. Some exotic saber-proof materials have been introduced in the \"Expanded Universe\". An active lightsaber gives off a distinctive hum, which rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air. Bringing the blade into contact with another lightsaber's blade produces a loud crackle.\n\nThere are several literary precedents in science fiction for a \"sword\" of pure energy that can cut through anything, notably:\n\nFor the original \"Star Wars\" film, the film prop hilts were constructed by John Stears from old Graflex press camera flash battery packs and other pieces of hardware. The full sized sword props were designed to appear ignited onscreen, by later creating an \"in-camera\" glowing effect in post-production. The blade is a three-sided rod which was coated with a Scotchlite retroreflector array, the same sort used for highway signs. A lamp was positioned to the side of the taking camera and reflected towards the subject through 45-degree angled glass so that the sword would appear to glow from the camera's point of view.\n\nSet Decorator Roger Christian found the handles for the Graflex Flash Gun in a photography shop in Great Marlborough Street, in London's West End. He then added cabinet T-track to the handles, securely attaching them with cyanoacrylate glue. Adding a few \"greebles\" (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a lightsaber prop for Luke before production began. George Lucas decided he wanted to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where \"Star Wars\" filming began. It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the Obi-Wan Kenobi/Darth Vader duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.\n\nKorean animator Nelson Shin, who was working for an American company at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the lightsaber in the live action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live action footage was given to him. He drew the lightsabers with a rotoscope, an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical lightsaber blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a lightsaber is made of light, the sword should look \"a little shaky\" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an optical printer, making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding a degausser sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an X-Acto knife to give the lightsaber a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements.\n\nThe lightsaber sound effect was developed by sound designer Ben Burtt as a combination of the hum of idling interlock motors in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless microphone. Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as he was looking for a buzzing, sparking sound to add to the projector-motor hum.\n\nThe pitch changes of lightsaber movement were produced by playing the basic lightsaber tone on a loudspeaker and recording it on a moving microphone, generating Doppler shift to mimic a moving sound source.\n\nLightsabers were present in the earliest drafts as mundane laser weapons that were used alongside laser guns. The introduction of the Force in a later revision made the Jedi and the Sith supernaturally skilled; initially they were only portrayed as swordsmen. The lightsaber became the Force-user's tool, described in \"A New Hope\" by Obi-Wan Kenobi as \"not as clumsy or random as a blaster. An elegant weapon, for a more civilized age.\" The source of a lightsaber's power is a kyber crystal. These crystals are also the power source of the Death Star's superlaser.\n\nLightsabers are depicted as hand-built as part of a Jedi's or Sith's training regimen. Each lightsaber is unique, though some may bear resemblance to others, especially if there is a connection between the builders. The first film appearance of the dual-bladed lightsaber (introduced in \"Tales of the Jedi\") was in \"\", wielded by Darth Maul. The video game \"\" introduced two other variants: a lightsaber pike (a lightsaber with a shorter blade but a long handle, resembling a spear) and a Tonfa-style lightsaber with right-angle hilt.\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" expanded universe adds several lightsaber types, including short and dual-phase (adjustable length) weapons. In \"Star Wars Rebels\", Ezra Bridger's original lightsaber is a hybrid that features a fully functional blaster pistol built into the handle. Kylo Ren, from \"\", uses a lightsaber that features two crosshilt blades, giving it the appearance of a greatsword.\n\nSome parts of the expanded universe contain depictions of a \"lightwhip\", which consists of energized tendrils that can slice or grip.\n\nLightsabers depicted in the first two released films, \"A New Hope\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\", had blades that were colored either blue (for the Jedi) or red (for the Sith). Luke Skywalker's new lightsaber in \"Return of the Jedi\" was colored blue during the initial editing of the film, and appears so in both an early movie trailer and the official theatrical posters, but it was ultimately colored green in the film. This was done so it would better stand out against the blue sky of Tatooine in outdoor scenes, and this color change is also reflected in the film's re-release posters. Mace Windu's purple-bladed lightsaber, as first seen in \"\", was requested by the actor Samuel L. Jackson as a way to make his character stand out among other Jedi. Jackson's favorite color is purple, and he frequently requests that the characters he plays use an item of that color. showed the guardians of the Jedi Temple wielding yellow-bladed lightsabers, and introduced the \"Darksaber\", which uniquely features a thin white outline around a black blade.\n\nIn the storyline, the builder of a lightsaber chooses the kyber crystal within it, which in turn determines the blade's color. The book \"\" and the comic series \"Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith\" reveal red blades to be an exception; to create a red blade, dark side users remove the crystal from a defeated Jedi's lightsaber and concentrate force energy on it to break its connection to the light side, a process known as \"bleeding\". The process can also be reversed, as shown in \"Ahsoka\" when the titular character does so to a pair of crystals taken from an Inquisitor; she uses them in a pair of white-bladed lightsabers.\n\nA multitude of visible spectrum blade colors appeared in the Expanded Universe and in other \"Star Wars\" products. The original Kenner figure of Luke Skywalker in his Tatooine costume from \"Star Wars\" was released with a yellow-bladed lightsaber. While no lightsaber blade colors beside blue, green or red appeared in the films before \"Attack of the Clones\", they have appeared in several computer games, which sometimes allow for player-customized colors. The \"\" video game series included yellow and silver options, for example.\n\nThe technical lightsaber choreography for the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy was developed by Hollywood sword-master Bob Anderson. Anderson personally trained Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and, in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\", performed all the stunts as Darth Vader during the lightsaber duels wearing Vader's costume. Anderson's role in the trilogy was highlighted in the film \"Reclaiming the Blade\" where he shared his experiences as a fencer developing the lightsaber techniques for the three original movies.\n\nThe lightsaber duels in the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy were specifically choreographed by stunt-coordinator Nick Gillard to be miniature \"stories\". For these films, Gillard was the primary sword instructor for Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn), Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader) among other actors. His goal in choreographing the action for \"The Phantom Menace\" was to create stunts that flow from the story; \"You can't just think, 'I'm a stunt coordinator, I'm going to make a big stunt happen',\" Gillard said. \"It's all about making it tie in nicely with the film so that you don't notice the stunts.\"\n\nIn writing the prequel trilogy, George Lucas said he wanted the lightsaber combat to be \"reminiscent of what had been done in the previous films but also something that was more energized. We'd seen old men, young boys, and characters who were half-droid, but we'd never seen a Jedi in his prime. I wanted to do that with a fight that was faster and more dynamic – and we were able to pull that off.\"\n\nAccording to Gillard (who would later go on to perform a cameo role in \"\"), various lightsaber combat styles were devised for the prequels and intended to further characterize their practitioners.\n\nFor \"The Phantom Menace\", Gillard set out certain styles and faults for the saber-wielding characters. He added that the Jedi's use of such \"a short-range weapon\" meant \"they would have to be very good at it\"; combining a variety of disciplines from various sword fighting styles to martial arts \"with a touch of tennis and tree chopping\", he created the style seen in the \"Episode I\" lightsaber battles.\n\nFor \"The Force Awakens\", director J. J. Abrams decided to approach the choreography similarly to how it was done in the original trilogy. Abrams stated that the prequel trilogy choreography was \"increasingly spectacular and stylised, almost like dance choreography\", but that was not what they really wanted to go for the new films. He told \"Empire\" magazine, \"When you look at \"Star Wars\" and \"Empire\", they are very different lightsaber battles, but for me they felt more powerful because they were not quite as slick. I was hoping to go for something much more primitive, aggressive and rougher, a throwback to the kind of heart-stopping lightsaber fights I remembered being so enthralled by as a kid.\"\n\nSince the release of the first film, replicas of lightsabers have been a popular piece of \"Star Wars\" merchandise, ranging from inexpensive plastic toys to the \"Force FX\" series from Master Replicas, deluxe replicas which use LED lighted tubes and sound effects to create a close audio-visual representation of what is seen on screen. Disneyland in California sells lightsaber-themed churros outside its \"Star Tours\" attraction.\n\nThe \"\" is a live show where children are selected to learn the teachings of the Jedi Knights, the Force, and the basics of Lightsaber combat to become Padawan learners. The show is present at the Rebels stage at Disney's Hollywood Studios and at the Tomorrowland Terrace at Disneyland.\n\nIn the \"Spaceballs\" film by Mel Brooks, \"the Schwartz\" is a play on \"the Force\", from \"Star Wars\". The lightsabers emanating from the Schwartz-rings held in front of the crotch are phallic symbols. The cartoon series \"Futurama\" features many lightsaber-style weapons, notably expanding batons used by police. The batons glow and \"whoosh\" with a lightsaber's distinctive hum, but merely slap victims when used, as if they are plastic toys. In Jim Butcher's \"Dresden Files\" novel series, medical examiner and \"Star Wars\" fan Waldo Butters wields one of the three holy Swords of the Cross, which re-fashions itself into a lightsaber upon accepting him as its owner.\n\nWith the advent of motion-controlled video games, the opportunity to physically wield a lightsaber in a video game became a reality. In the seventh generation of video game consoles, there were several \"Star Wars\" video games available on the Wii (\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\") and one on the Xbox 360 (\"Kinect Star Wars\") that utilized motion controls to wield a lightsaber through arm gestures. \"Unleashed\" and \"Duels\", both developed by Krome Studios, have more precise control of the lightsaber, allowing players to swing it in any of five different directions (up, down, left, right or forward) with the Wii Remote, while \"Kinect\" takes advantage of the eponymous, camera-based motion controller to grant the player a more fluid, one-to-one control method of swinging the lightsaber. \n\nPrior to the seventh generation, there were also a few earlier \"Star Wars\" games that used gesture-based control to simulate lightsaber combat, such as the two bonus levels of the arcade game \"Star Wars Trilogy\", where the player controls Luke Skywalker as he wields his lightsaber against Boba Fett and Darth Vader in \"Return of the Jedi\" by pushing a joystick in one of eight directions to follow on-screen offensive and defensive cues, and a TV game released around the release of \"Revenge of the Sith\", titled \"Star Wars: Saga Edition - Lightsaber Battle Game\", in which the player swings a lightsaber-shaped controller to deflect blaster bolts from infantry (such as battle droids and clone troopers) and duel against characters from across the saga.\n\nBy the time Disney purchased Lucasfilm, new technological advances made augmented reality possible, leading to the creation of some more notable motion-controlled lightsaber video games that took advantage of that feature. One of them came in the form of a special activity mode in the official \"Star Wars\" fan app on iOS and Android in which players use their smartphone's motion sensors to practice and master blaster deflection with a training droid (which appears on the phone's rear camera), similar to the deflection training exercises featured aboard the \"Millennium Falcon\" in \"A New Hope\", while progressing through the ranks of the Jedi or Sith order. Another is in \"Star Wars: Jedi Challenges\", which works with a Lenovo Mirage AR headset, a tracking sensor and a dedicated lightsaber controller that launched in December 2017. One of the multiple game modes available in \"Challenges\", which was jointly developed by Disney and Lenovo, enables players to confront \"Star Wars\" villains in lightsaber duels, such as Darth Maul and Kylo Ren.\n\n\n"}

The ponds are also found on glacial ice and ice shelves. Ponds of melted water can also develop under the ice.\n\nMelt ponds are usually darker than the surrounding ice, and their distribution and size is highly variable. They absorb solar radiation rather than reflecting it as ice does and, thereby, have a significant influence on Earth's radiation balance. This differential, which had not been scientifically investigated until recently, has a large effect on the rate of ice melting and the extent of ice cover.\n\nMelt ponds can melt through to the ocean's surface. Seawater entering the pond increases the melt rate because the salty water of the ocean is warmer than the fresh water of the pond. The increase in salinity also depresses the water's freezing point.\n\nWater from melt ponds over land surface can run into crevasses or moulins – tubes leading under ice sheets or glaciers – turning into meltwater. The water may reach the underlying rock. The effect is an increase in the rate of ice flow to the oceans, as the fluid behaves like a lubricant in the basal sliding of glaciers.\n\nThe effects of melt ponds are diverse (this subsection refers to melt ponds on ice sheets and ice shelves). Research by Ted Scambos, of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, has supported the melt water fracturing theory that suggests the melting process associated with melt ponds has a substantial effect on ice shelf disintegration.\nSeasonal melt ponded and penetrating under glaciers shows seasonal acceleration and deceleration of ice flows affecting whole icesheets. Accumulated changes by ponding on ice sheets appear in the earthquake record of Greenland and other glaciers: \n\"Quakes ranged from six to 15 per year from 1993 to 2002, then jumped to 20 in 2003, 23 in 2004, and 32 in the first 10 months of 2005.\" Ponding in the extreme is lakes and lakes in association with glaciers are examined in the particular case of the Missoula Floods.\n\n"}

Many of the areas hit by the storm had been affected by Hurricane Sandy days before, which further complicated recovery efforts.\n\nA mid-level shortwave over the Midwestern United States was moving eastward on November 6, just four days after Hurricane Sandy dissipated, toward a trough over the Southeastern United States, and into an area with abundant moisture and favorable conditions from the jet stream. The combination was favorable for a nor'easter to form, and on November 7, a strong low pressure area developed along the coast of North Carolina. At the time, there was an area of cold air inland the Mid-Atlantic States and New England that would allow the precipitation to fall as snow. By November 8, the system drifting to the northeast, located about south-southeast of Boston, Massachusetts, with a front extending northeastward to Nova Scotia. Its large circulation dropped rain and snow across the northeastern United States.\nSome areas within NYC, got close to a foot of snow across Western Long Island, including Eastern Queens County in a narrow snow band that set up because of the coastal front. \n\nBefore the nor'easter struck, officials recommended residents in low-lying areas of New York City to evacuate, and portions of Islip, New York were under a mandatory evacuation. There were also voluntary evacuations in Milford, Connecticut. A portion of the Long Island Expressway was closed during the storm, and the Long Island Rail Road shut down. Airlines canceled over 1,300 flights in or out of New York airports. Parks in New York City were closed, and construction was halted. In Nassau County, New York, more than 140 trucks put sand and salt on roads. Schools were closed in Connecticut. Due to sufficiently cool air and steady snowfall, the National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning. \nAcross New Jersey and New York, the storm dropped rain and snow in areas that sustained significant damage from Hurricane Sandy about ten days prior. Snowfall spread from New Jersey to Maine, peaking at in Clintonville, Connecticut, and the highest associated rainfall total was near Kingston, Massachusetts. Snowfall in Central Park reached , which broke the daily record and also the record for the earliest date of more than at the location. Daily snowfall records were also broken in Newark, New Jersey and Bridgeport, Connecticut with totals of and , respectively. The nor'easter also produced strong winds that peaked at in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. High winds downed trees that were weakened by Sandy, some of which fell onto power lines. About 50,000 people lost power in the two states who had previously lost power after the hurricane. Along the coast, the storm produced waves, and coastal roads were flooded. There were two traffic deaths in Connecticut that were related to the storm.\n\nOn November 8 as of 9 a.m. EST, around 715,000 eastern U.S. homes and businesses were without power. This is an increase of nearly 43,000 from 12 hours earlier, due the effects of the storm. There were 167,000 power outages in New Jersey alone, and at least 50,000 on Long Island.\n\nAt 6 a.m. EST on November 9, about 265,000 New Jersey homes and businesses were without power because of Sandy and the nor'easter.\n\nThe Weather Channel dubbed this storm as \"\"Winter Storm Athena\",\" but this name was rejected by the National Weather Service. In response to the naming system, the National Weather Service announced on November 7, 2012 that it would not recognize the Weather Channel's names for winter storms, stating in a press release that \"it does not use the name of winter storms in its products.\"\n\n"}

The PAEC organizes conferences and directs research at the country's leading universities. \nSince the 1960s, the PAEC is also a scientific research partner and sponsor of European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), where Pakistani scientists have contributed to developing particle accelerators and research on high-energy physics. PAEC scientists regularly pay visits to CERN while taking part in projects led by CERN.\n\nIn 2001, the PAEC was integrated with the National Command Authority (Pakistan) which is under the Prime Minister of Pakistan.\n\nFollowing the partition of British Indian Empire by the United Kingdom in 1947, Pakistan emerged as a Muslim-dominated state. The turbulent nature of its emergence critically influenced the scientific development of the country.\n\nThe establishment of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR) in 1951 began Pakistan's research on physical sciences. In 1953, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower announced the Atoms for Peace program, and of which Pakistan became its earliest partner. Research at PAEC initially followed a strict non-weapon policy issued by then-Foreign Minister Sir Sir Zafar-ulla Khan. In 1955, the government established a committee of scientists to prepare nuclear energy plans and build an industrial nuclear infrastructure throughout the country. As the Energy Council Act went into full effect, Prime minister Huseyn Suhrawardy established the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in March 1956. Its first chair was Nazir Ahmad – an experimental physicist. Other members of the PAEC included Technical member Salimuzzaman Siddiqui, an organic chemist at the University of Karachi, and Raziuddin Siddiqui, a mathematical physicist at the same university. Together, they both took charge of the research and development directorates of the commission. In 1958, Abdus Salam of the University of the Punjab also joined the commission, along with Munir Ahmad Khan who initially lobbied for acquiring a pool-type reactor from the United States.\n\nIn 1958, PAEC Chairman Nazir Ahmad proposed to the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation to build a heavy water production facility with production capacity of 50 kg of heavy water per day at Multan, but this proposal was not acted on. In 1960, I.H. Usmani was elevated as PAEC's second chair with the transfer of Nazir Ahmad at the Federal Bureau of Statistics. The reactor was built in 1962, financed by local fertilizer companies. In 1964, PAEC established its first research institute, the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH), at Nilore, and began negotiation for country's first commercial nuclear power plant to be built in Karachi. In 1965, the PAEC reached an agreement with Canadian General Electric to build a CANDU reactor in Karachi. Financial investment for the nuclear power plant in Karachi was provided by the Economic Coordination Committee, and Edward Durell Stone was commissioned to oversee the architectural design of PINSTECH. From 1965–71, the PAEC sent 600 scientists abroad for training in nuclear sciences. in 1969, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, agreed to supply a small scale nuclear reprocessing plant, with the capacity to extract 360 grams of plutonium per year. In 1973, the PAEC announced the discovery of large uranium deposits in Punjab.\n\nAfter India's decisive victory in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Pakistan retracted its non-weapon policy and the research and development of nuclear weapons began in 1972. PAEC's senior nuclear engineer Munir Ahmad Khan, who threw himself with full rigor for this task, was named as PAEC's third chair by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Work began on ingenious development of the nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure and nuclear weapons research in the 1970s. Key research took place at PINSTECH, where scientists worked on weapon designs and eventual nuclear weapons testing. The PAEC expanded the crash program with various laboratories, facilities, and directorates researching on developing and testing materials and components for bomb designs, whilst it engineered plants and funded facilities for production of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium. In 1976, the possible test sites were decided by the PAEC and construction on test sites were completed in 1979. In 1983, PAEC's efforts reached to a milestone when it had conducted a first subcritical test on a weapon design; such testing continued until the early 1990s under codename: Kirana-I.\n\nFollowing nuclear tests by India earlier in the month, on 28 May 1998, PAEC led the final preparations and conducted Pakistan's first nuclear tests (Codename: Chagai-I), which was followed by Chagai-II in Kharan Desert on 30 May 1998. In 2001, the PAEC's research was focused back to civilian and peaceful research with the establishment of the National Command Authority and the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority.\n\nSince its establishment in 1956, the PAEC provided a conspicuous example of benefit of the atomic-age technologies for the advancement of agriculture, engineering, biology, and medicine. In 1960, the PAEC established its first nuclear medicines center for Cancer treatment at the Jinnah Medical College of the University of Karachi; the second Medical Isotope Institute was established at the Mayo Hospital of the King Edward Medical University, Lahore. Physicians and medical researchers were provided with facilities for cancer diagnose and treatment by the PAEC's funding.\n\nIn 1960, the PAEC established its regional atomic research center in Lahore, and a metallurgy center in Karachi in 1963. Another energy center was located in Dhaka where many scientists were educated. In 1967, the PAEC founded the Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences which became one of the primary technical universities of the country. Many of the PAEC's scientists and engineers served in its faculty. The PAEC supports its university-level physics program at the Government College University, Lahore where it awards fellowships to the students. The PAEC continues to promotes its program as \"peaceful uses of atomic energy commenced for the benefit the scientific community as well as public.\"\n\nAbout its promotion of education, senior scientist, Ishfaq Ahmad quoted: \"the PAEC was responsible to send more than 600 scientists to the abroad. As of present, PAEC maintains its prestigious image, and is now noted as one of the largest science and technology institution of the country. The PAEC supports research activities and learning programs at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), of which PAEC is also its organizer. Since 1974, the PAEC has been a key organizer and sponsor of the International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs conference each and every year where scientists from all over the world are delegated to the country. The science conference in Nathiagali provides the dissemination of the knowledge advancement in physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, mathematics, computer science, logic, and philosophy.\n\nAs the emphasis shifted towards concerns for the national security interests, the PAEC's important projects were also initiated in this area. Many of the notable scientists with international prestige have worked and affiliated with the PAEC. With the establishment of Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA) and National Command Authority, the PAEC focused has not shifted back to utilization of nuclear power on peaceful and industrial usage as well as continued the research in nuclear developments in terms of both peaceful and scientific use.\n\nAs of current, the PAEC is held responsible for design preparation and proper operational function of the commercial nuclear power plants. The PAEC provides lobby at the governmental level for the safe usage of the nuclear power sources; though the safety regulations and protections of the nuclear power facilities are managed by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA). Providing the policy guidance to the government, PAEC's studies envisions setting up power plants energy production with a capacity of ~8800MW by 2030.\n\nUnder this policy, the KANUPP power plants and CHASHNUPP power plants are expanded and currently under construction under PAEC and PNRA.\n\n\nPakistan has a long history of participating in an experiments and research undertaking with CERN, and has a long tradition of wonderful physicists who are working around the world. Since the 1960s, Pakistan has been contributing and regularly participating in CERN's project, theoretical and nuclear experiments. A prime example would be Abdus Salam; Salam was the first man to be accredited with all the collaboration with CERN which continues till the present when he convinced CERN to give Pakistan stacks of nuclear emulsion exposed for further study of pions, kaons and antiprotons in the 1960s. Some theoretical physicists from Pakistan had the opportunity to work at CERN through short visits. During the 1980s, some of the experimental physicists from Pakistan, specialising in the technique of Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors (SSNTD), also benefited from CERN by exposing the stacks in the beam at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).\n\nIn 2005, CERN awarded PAEC with the ATLAS Supplier Award in 2005, in connection with manufacturing and fabrication of various equipment for CERN.\n\nOn 27 June 2011, PAEC and CERN reached an agreement for extending the technical cooperation with CERN's upcoming programmes. CERN's Director-General Rolf-Dieter Heuer personally paid a visit to Pakistan where he spoke for the need of importance of Science in Pakistan and importance of Germany's strategic alliance with Pakistan. The agreement was signed in order to extend an earlier agreement, which came into operation in 2003 between CERN and Pakistan for the supply of manufactured equipment for Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN along with placement of scientists and engineers from Pakistan to assist in the scientific programme of CERN.\n\nWith the efforts led by the PAEC, the CERN granted and made Pakistan as its associate member, on 22 June 2014— the first Asian country and second Muslim country after Turkey.\n\nIn 1997, Ishfaq Ahmad— chair of the PAEC— reached to CERN to sign a contract between PAEC and CERN after elaborate discussions an in-kind contribution worth one million Swiss francs for the construction of eight magnet supports for the CMS detector.\n\nFor CMS, the PAEC built magnet feet and installed 320 Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC), as well as contributing to CMS computing. Several other mechanical components for ATLAS and for the LHC were also built by the PAEC. It was PAEC's efforts that led the Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) with CERN's direct cooperation in the area of radioprotection.\n\nIn 2000, CERN signed another agreement which doubled the Pakistani contribution from one to two million Swiss francs. And with this new agreement Pakistan started construction of the resistive plate chambers required for the CMS muon system. While more recently, a protocol has been signed enhancing Pakistan’s total contribution to the LHC programme to $10 million. Pakistan with all these efforts is already hoping to become an observer state at CERN. In 2006 PAEC and CERN agreed on expanded cooperation, including contributions by PAEC valued at 5 million Swiss francs.\n\nThe PAEC, partnered with country's leading universities, send a large team of scientists and engineers to CERN to participate in Large Hadron Collider on 10 September 2008. According to the news sources, the team of Pakistani scientists were keenly involved in the involved in the development of the Large Hadron Collider— the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator.\n\nThe data of the experiment was available for the Pakistani scientists who would examine the data and results would be accumulated afterwards by the Pakistan physicists.\n\nThe PAEC is chaired by the appointed chairperson by the Government of Pakistan as the governmental notification is released. The PAEC's corporate management is organized by the Government who awarded contracts to the potential candidates. Its full-time members are consisted of the appointed Chair; a finance member; and two technical members. Its part-time members are composed of the senior scientists and a chief scientific adviser to the government.\n\nThe PAEC's corporate team are constitutionally bound to meet not less than four times every year for the execution of development projects involving nuclear power stations and the generation of electric power.

{"id": "3836728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3836728", "title": "Rex Tillerson", "text": "Rex Tillerson\n\nRex Wayne Tillerson (born March 23, 1952) is a former American government official and former energy executive who served as the 69th United States Secretary of State from February 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018, under President Donald Trump. Originally a civil engineer, Tillerson joined Exxon in 1975. He rose to become chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, holding that position from 2006 until 2017, when he left to join the Trump administration.\n\nTillerson began his career as a civil engineer and holds a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. By 1989 he had become general manager of the Exxon USA central production division. In 1995 he became president of Exxon Yemen Inc. and Esso Exploration and Production Khorat Inc. In 2006 Tillerson was elected chair and chief executive of Exxon, the world's sixth largest company by revenue. Tillerson retired from Exxon effective January 1, 2017. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering.\n\nTillerson is a long-time volunteer with the Boy Scouts of America and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. From 2010 to 2012 he was the national president of the Boy Scouts, its highest non-executive position. He is a long-time contributor to Republican campaigns, but did not donate to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. In 2014, Tillerson, who had made business deals on behalf of Exxon with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, opposed the sanctions against Russia. He has previously been the director of the joint United States-Russia oil company Exxon Neftegas.\n\nTillerson joined the Trump administration on February 1, 2017. Trump dismissed Tillerson on March 13, 2018, making his tenure one of the shortest in recent history. Trump stated that he would nominate CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson. Tillerson's term officially ended on March 31, 2018; Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan served as acting secretary until Pompeo was sworn in.\n\nTillerson's tenure was characterized by a lack of visibility in comparison to his predecessors in the traditionally high-profile position of Secretary of State. According to the American Foreign Service Association, during Tillerson's tenure, new applications to work for the Foreign Service fell by 50%, and 60% of high-ranking career diplomats in the State Department resigned.\n\nTillerson was born on March 23, 1952, in Wichita Falls, Texas, the son of Patty Sue (née Patton) and Bobby Joe Tillerson, and named after Rex Allen and John Wayne, two Hollywood actors famous for playing cowboys.\n\nHe was raised in Vernon, Texas; Stillwater, Oklahoma; and Huntsville, Texas. He has two sisters, Rae Ann Hamilton, a physician who resides in Abilene, Texas, and Jo Lynn Peters, a high school educator.\n\nTillerson's father was an executive of the Boy Scouts of America organization, and this led to his family's move to Huntsville, Texas. Tillerson himself has been active in the Boy Scouts for most of his life, and in his youth he earned the rank of Eagle Scout.\n\nAt age 14, he began to work as a bus boy in the student union building at Oklahoma State University. Two years later in 1968 he became a janitor working in one of the engineering buildings at the university. On weekends, he worked picking cotton.\n\nTillerson graduated from Huntsville High School in 1970. He was a section leader for the percussion section of his high school band, in which he played the kettle drums and snare drum, and he earned spots in the all-district and all-region bands during his senior year. Tillerson received a college scholarship from the University of Texas Longhorn Band. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 1975. During his time at UT Austin, he was involved with the Tejas Club, and the marching band.\n\nTillerson joined Exxon Company USA in 1975 as a production engineer. In 1989, Tillerson became general manager of the central production division of Exxon USA. In 1995, he became President of Exxon Yemen Inc. and Esso Exploration and Production Khorat Inc.\n\nIn 1998, he became a vice president of Exxon Ventures (CIS) and president of Exxon Neftegas Limited with responsibility for Exxon's holdings in Russia and the Caspian Sea. He then entered Exxon into the Sakhalin-I consortium with Rosneft.\n\nIn 1999, with the merger of Exxon and Mobil, he was named executive vice president of ExxonMobil Development Company. In 2004, he became president and director of ExxonMobil. Upon this appointment Tillerson's replacement of Lee Raymond as CEO of Exxon Mobil was implied. His major competitor was Ed Galante, another Exxon executive. On January 1, 2006, Tillerson was elected chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), following the retirement of Lee Raymond. At the time, Exxon had 80,000 employees, did business in nearly 200 countries, and had an annual revenue of nearly $400 billion.\n\nUnder Tillerson's leadership, ExxonMobil cooperated closely with Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a longtime U.S. ally; Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. From 2003 to 2005, a European subsidiary of ExxonMobil, Infineum, operated in the Middle East providing sales to Iran, Sudan and Syria. ExxonMobil stated that they followed all legal framework and that such sales were minuscule compared to their annual revenue of $371 billion at the time. In 2009, ExxonMobil acquired XTO Energy, a major natural gas producer, for $31 billion in stock. Michael Corkery of the \"Wall Street Journal\" wrote that \"Tillerson's legacy rides on the XTO Deal.\" Tillerson approved Exxon negotiating a multibillion-dollar deal with the government of Iraqi Kurdistan, despite opposition from President Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, both of whom argued it would increase regional instability.\n\nTillerson lobbied against Rule 1504 of the Dodd–Frank reform and protections, which would have required Exxon to disclose payments to foreign governments. In 2017, Congress voted to overturn Rule 1504 one hour before Tillerson was confirmed as Secretary of State.\n\nOn January 4, 2017, \"The Financial Times\" reported that Tillerson would cut his ExxonMobil ties if he became Secretary of State. Walter Shaub, the director of the United States Office of Government Ethics, said he was proud of the ethics agreement developed for Tillerson, who was now \"free of financial conflicts of interest. His ethics agreement serves as a sterling model for what we'd like to see with other nominees.\"\n\nTillerson has ties with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. They have been associates since Tillerson represented Exxon's interests in Russia, the world's largest producer of crude oil, during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's tenure. Tillerson was responsible for the development of a partnership between Exxon and state-owned oil company Rosneft and the ultimately unsuccessful attempt to acquire a stake in Yukos, owned by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, before the firm was nationalized after Khodorkovsky's arrest. John Hamre, the President and CEO of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, of which Tillerson is a board member, states that Tillerson \"has had more interactive time with Vladimir Putin than probably any other American, with the exception of Dr. Henry Kissinger.\"\n\nTillerson was a friend of Igor Sechin, the Executive Chairman of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company, and leader of the Kremlin's \"Siloviki\" (security/military) faction, who has been described as \"Russia's second-most powerful person\" after Putin. Exxon owns a dacha next door to Sechin's and Tillerson would often visit him there. Tillerson led Sechin on a tour of New York City, dining on caviar with him and Putin at the \"Per Se\" restaurant. In 2006, Exxon avoided making any government concessions in its Sakhalin-I oil field after Royal Dutch Shell was forced to sell half of its ownership in Sakhalin-II by the Russian government.\n\nIn August 2011, Putin attended a ceremony in Sochi where Tillerson and Sechin signed an agreement between ExxonMobil and Rosneft to drill the East-Prinovozemelsky field in the Arctic Ocean valued at up to $300 billion. The Rosneft deal also gave the state-owned oil company a 30% stake in Exxon owned assets in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Canada, and West Texas. The company began drilling in the Kara Sea in the summer of 2014, and a round of sanctions against Russia introduced in September that year due to the Ukrainian crisis was to have brought the project to a halt in mid-September. Nevertheless, the company was granted a reprieve that stretched the window to work until October 10, which enabled it to discover a major field with about 750 million barrels of new oil for Russia. In July 2017, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control fined ExxonMobil $2 million for violating sanctions in its dealings with Sechin, leading the company to sue the government.\n\nIn 2013, Tillerson was awarded the Order of Friendship by Putin for his contribution to developing cooperation in the energy sector.\n\nIn June 2017, Tillerson said Trump had asked him to \"stabilize the relationship (with Russia) and build trust.\"\n\nIn 2012, Tillerson's compensation package was $40.5 million. It was $28.1 million in 2013, $33.1 million in 2014, and $27.2 million in 2015. In late 2016, Tillerson held $54 million of Exxon stock, and had a right to deferred stock worth approximately $180 million over the next 10 years. Tillerson is estimated to be worth at least $300 million. When he left Exxon, Tillerson was four months away from retirement, at which time he would have been entitled to a $180 million retirement package. He owns two ranches in Texas, where his wife, Renda, raises cutting horses.\n\nOn January 3, 2017, ExxonMobil announced they had reached an agreement with Tillerson \"to sever all ties with the company to comply with conflict-of-interest requirements associated with his nomination as secretary of state.\"\n\nWhile CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson used an alias email address \"Wayne Tracker\" for eight years and sent thousands of messages. In response to a subpoena issued by the New York State Attorney General's Office (part of a state investigation into whether Exxon had misled investors and the public about climate change), Exxon produced about 60 emails associated with the \"Wayne Tracker\" account, but did not inform investigators that they were Tillerson's. ExxonMobil stated that the account was \"used for everyday business\" needs such as \"secure and expedited communications\" between Tillerson and top company executives.\n\nTillerson's use of the alias became publicly known in March 2017, after New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman wrote in a letter to a judge that Tillerson had used the \"Wayne Tracker\" email for at least seven years. Later that month, Exxon revealed that emails from the alias account from September 2014 to September 2015 were missing; a further search recovered some emails, but none between September 5, 2014, and November 28, 2014. An attorney for Exxon said that a \"unique issue\" limited to that account led to emails being automatically deleted.\n\nTillerson is a trustee of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the American Petroleum Institute. He is also a member of the Business Roundtable. In 2013, he became a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He was a member of the executive committee of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012.\n\nTillerson is a long-time volunteer with the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), and from 2010 to 2012 was their national president, its highest non-executive position. Tillerson is a Distinguished Eagle Scout, and his father was a BSA executive. Tillerson is a long-time supporter of the BSA and has said, \"I think the highlight of my youth and adolescent years were my achievements in Scouting.\" In 2009, Tillerson was inducted into the Eagle Scout Hall of Fame of the Greater New York Councils. Ray L. Hunt, a close friend and the Chairman of Hunt Consolidated, told the Dallas Morning News, \"To understand Rex Tillerson, you need to understand Scouting.\"\n\nAfter the end of his term as BSA president, he remained on the organization's National Executive Board. There he played a significant role in the board's 2013 decision to rescind the long-standing ban on openly gay youth as members. According to Center for Strategic and International Studies president John Hamre, Tillerson was instrumental in the change and \"a key leader in helping the group come to a consensus\".\n\nOn July 9, 2017, Tillerson received the Dewhurst Award from the World Petroleum Council in recognition for \"outstanding contribution to the oil and gas industry\" during his 41 years at Exxon Mobil.\n\nTillerson was first recommended to then-President-elect Trump for the Secretary of State role by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, during her meeting with Trump in late November 2016. Rice's recommendation of Tillerson to Trump was backed up by former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, three days later. Media speculation that he was being considered for the position began on December 5, 2016. On December 9, transition officials reported that Tillerson was the top candidate for the position, surpassing contenders such as Mitt Romney and David Petraeus. His nomination was reportedly advocated by Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner.\n\nOn January 20, 2017, shortly after being sworn in as President of the United States, Trump formally sent his nomination of Tillerson as Secretary of State to the United States Senate. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved Tillerson's nomination 11–10, a strict party line vote, on January 23, 2017.\n\nThe Senate confirmed Tillerson as Secretary of State on February 1, 2017. The Senate voted 56 to 43, with all 52 Republicans in support of his nomination as well as three Democrats and one independent. He was sworn in on the same day by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe number of votes against Tillerson's confirmation was unusual for a Secretary of State. The previous record for votes against a nominee for Secretary of State had been fourteen. \nOn February 15, 2017, Tillerson embarked on his first overseas trip as Secretary of State to Bonn, Germany, meeting with foreign ministers from the G20. In Bonn, Tillerson had meetings with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov of Russia and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, as well as his counterparts from Italy, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. Tillerson urged Russia to withdraw from eastern Ukraine, stating that \"the United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical cooperation that will benefit the American people. Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies. As we search for new common ground, we expect Russia to honor its commitment to the Minsk agreements and work to de-escalate the violence in Ukraine.\" Tillerson also reaffirmed U.S. commitment to defending South Korea and Japan.\n\nTillerson made his first visit to Mexico on February 23, 2017, traveling with Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly. When meeting with Secretary of Foreign Affairs Luis Videgaray Caso of Mexico, Tillerson acknowledged differences between the U.S. and Mexico on views of border security, but also acknowledged the need for cooperation in addressing migration, as well as arms trafficking. Tillerson recused himself from TransCanada's application for a presidential permit for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nBefore the inauguration, Tillerson selected Elliott Abrams to be the United States Deputy Secretary of State. In February 2017, they held an interview with President Trump in the Oval Office. There, Tillerson contradicted the President's criticism of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, advising Trump of Exxon's success in refusing a bribe demand by Yemen's oil minister. The next day, Fox News criticized Abrams, and Tillerson soon told Abrams he would not be nominated.\n\nIn mid-March 2017, Tillerson made his first trip to Asia, traveling to Japan, South Korea, and China. Tillerson remarked that diplomatic efforts in the past 20 years to stop North Korea's nuclear development had \"failed\". Tillerson also stated the United States may need to take preemptive action, remarking \"Certainly, we do not want things to get to a military conflict ... but obviously, if North Korea takes actions that threatens the South Korean forces or our own forces, then that would be met with an appropriate response. If they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe that requires action, that option is on the table.\"\n\nOn March 30, 2017, Tillerson met with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey. Turkey has criticized the United States over its support for Syrian Kurds. In May, protestors and Erdoğan's bodyguards clashed outside of the Turkish Ambassador's Residence in Washington, D.C. Tillerson said that the incident was \"outrageous\" and that the Trump administration has expressed \"dismay\" over it. He said the administration will await the outcome of an investigation before taking further action.\n\nIn mid-April 2017, Tillerson made his first trip to Russia as Secretary of State, meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and President Vladimir Putin. At a news conference, Tillerson remarked that Russian-U.S. relations were at a \"low point\". Tillerson also warned Russia of the risk of \"becoming irrelevant in the Middle East\" by continuing to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn May 2017, Tillerson joined Trump on the President's first overseas trip, with the first destination being Saudi Arabia. While in Saudi Arabia, Tillerson held a joint press conference with Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir.\n\nIn June 2017, Tillerson excluded Myanmar, Iraq, and Afghanistan from the list of countries that employ child soldiers in that year's Trafficking in Persons Report, rejecting the unanimous recommendations of staff. Staff then circulated a memo in their Dissent Channel alleging that Tillerson's decision was in violation of the Child Soldiers Prevention Act. In late November 2017, the topic garned national attention when the State Department defended Tillerson's actions in the wake of an anonymous complaint by a State Department official to the State Department Inspector General and the distribution of supporting documents to the Inspector General and to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nPresident Trump's 2018 United States federal budget sought to reduce the State Department's budget by 31%. Tillerson froze most hiring and sought to remove 2,000 career diplomats by offering them $25,000 buyouts. In June 2017, Tillerson told graduates of the Rangel and the Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowships that their offers to join the United States Foreign Service were rescinded and that they needed to repay the $85,000 scholarships or agree to work in temporary positions. Tillerson reversed that decision and allowed the graduates to become full Foreign Service Officers after being asked to do so by 31 members of Congress. Applications to take the Foreign Service entrance exam dropped 50% that year.\n\nTillerson and his staff fired career ambassadors Patrick F. Kennedy and Kristie Kenney, and attempted to remove Linda Thomas-Greenfield, who then retired.\n\nTillerson selected Margaret Peterlin to be his Chief of Staff. Tillerson is reported to rely heavily on Peterlin, as well as his chief of policy, Brian Hook. Tillerson has attempted to centralize much decision making under the Policy Planning Staff.\n\nTillerson has initiated the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, focusing on the State Department's organizational structure. Tillerson contracted for management consulting from Deloitte and hired Insigniam to conduct a \"listening tour\" survey for $1 million. Tillerson has attempted to reduce inefficiencies within the State Department, though it has been described as a \"botched reorganisation\" that has created a hollowed out and dysfunctional department, reportedly leading to micromanaging and poor morale among career diplomats. He has been praised for setting the right tone for diplomats.\n\nTillerson was reportedly angered by the political speech President Trump delivered at the 2017 National Scout Jamboree.\n\nIn October 2017, news reports surfaced regarding a deteriorating relationship between Tillerson and Trump. According to reports, in a July 20 meeting, Trump suggested a ten-fold increase in the United States nuclear arsenal, which would cost trillions and take centuries, after which individuals familiar with the meeting told journalists that Tillerson either called Trump a \"moron\" or a \"fucking moron\". Additionally, there were well-sourced reports of Tillerson offering to resign his office as Secretary of State, only to be discouraged from doing so by Vice President Mike Pence; however, these were officially denied by both Tillerson and the White House. Furthermore, on October 1, Trump directly contradicted, via a public tweet, Tillerson's policy of negotiation with North Korea; this move was widely panned by experts, who thought that such a public undermining of the chief diplomat of the United States would weaken Tillerson's ability to negotiate with other countries. On October 10, after Tillerson's alleged \"moron\" comment was reported in the media, Trump challenged Tillerson to \"IQ tests\", and three days later Senator Bob Corker from Tennessee, the Chair of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee who had become a vocal Trump critic around that time, remarked that Trump was \"publicly castrating\" Tillerson.\n\nIn November 2017, Tillerson said that recent Rohingya persecution in Myanmar was ethnic cleansing.\n\nTillerson has made a concerted effort to respond to the State Department's backlog of Freedom of Information Act requests that reach into Secretary Hillary Clinton's tenure, assigning midlevel diplomats from every bureau to perform document review aside unpaid interns.\n\nBy the end of November 2017, 10 of the top 44 political positions in the State Department had been filled. A large number of Senior Foreign Service officers had resigned under Tillerson, with the number of career ambassadors and ministers dropping more than 50%, from 39 to 19, and the number of minister-counselors dropping 18% to 369.\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Tillerson commented on the nerve gas poisoning in the United Kingdom of a former Russian spy and his daughter, calling it a \"really egregious act\" that clearly \"came from Russia\".\n\nAccording to the White House, Trump communicated with Tillerson on March 9 and told him he would be replaced. Tillerson cut short a visit to Africa and returned to the United States on March 12. On March 13, Trump announced via a public tweet that Tillerson was out. A spokesman for Tillerson, Steve Goldstein (the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy), was quoted by the \"Washington Post\" that Tillerson did not know why he had been fired by Trump and only found out about his firing when he read Trump's tweet on the morning of March 13; Goldstein, who was generally perceived within the White House as being anti-Trump, was fired by the White House later that day, reportedly for contradicting the official account of Tillerson's dismissal. A senior Trump administration official cited \"upcoming North Korea talks and various trade negotiations\" as the reason for replacing Tillerson. Trump later told reporters that his differences with Tillerson came down to personal chemistry and disagreements on policy, adding that he and Pompeo \"have a very similar thought process\". \"The New York Times\" reported that Lebanese-American businessman George Nader turned Trump's major fundraiser Elliott Broidy \"into an instrument of influence at the White House for the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates...High on the agenda of the two men...was pushing the White House to remove Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\".\n\nJohn Sullivan, the Deputy Secretary of State, served as acting Secretary until March 31, when Tillerson formally left office. Trump proposed CIA Director Mike Pompeo (with whom Trump has a much more positive relationship) as Tillerson's successor and Gina Haspel as the new CIA Director. Haspel was confirmed on May 17, 2018, making her the first female CIA director. Tillerson's total time in office was 423 days, making him the shortest-serving Secretary of State since Lawrence Eagleburger (1992–93). The last time a president's first appointee to the position served for less time was in 1898, when John Sherman left office after 413 days.\n\nIn March 2017, Robert Jervis of Columbia University wrote that Tillerson \"had little impact on the Trump administration so far\" and that his influence would continue to wane. That same month, William Inboden of the University of Texas at Austin defended Tillerson, saying that he deserves more time. Daniel W. Drezner of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University was highly critical of Tillerson, calling him an \"unmitigated disaster\", and \"the most incompetent Secretary of State in modern history.\" Elliot Cohen of Johns Hopkins University said that Tillerson might be one of the weakest Secretaries of State in American history. Elizabeth Saunders of George Washington University said that Tillerson's tenure had damaged the State Department \"for a generation\" and decreased America's ability to respond to major crisis.\n\nTillerson's tenure as Secretary of State lasted 405 days, one of the shortest tenures in modern history. Tillerson is the shortest-serving Secretary since Lawrence Eagleburger, who served during the last month of President George H. W. Bush's term. Excluding Secretaries whose tenures were ended by the arrival of a new presidential administration, Tillerson is the shortest-serving Secretary since 1900. According to long-time diplomat Aaron David Miller, Tillerson is also the only Secretary of State since at least 1945 to have been fired.\n\nIn October 2017, \"Politico\" reported that Tillerson's major foreign policy positions include \"urging the United States to stay in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accord, taking a hard line on Russia, advocating negotiations and dialogue to defuse the mounting crisis with North Korea, advocating for continued U.S. adherence to the Iran nuclear deal, taking a neutral position in the dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and reassuring jittery allies, from South Korea and Japan to our NATO partners, that America still has their back\".\n\nIn 2014, Tillerson expressed opposition to the sanctions against Russia in response to the annexation of Crimea at an Exxon shareholder meeting. He told the meeting \"We do not support sanctions, generally, because we don't find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented comprehensively and that's a very hard thing to do.\" In 2016, Tillerson said that the US should have deployed military units to neighboring states next to Russia in a more \"muscular\" response. In 2017, Tillerson said that Russia's annexation of Crimea was illegal. He also compared China's controversial island-building in the South China Sea to Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nDuring his Secretary of State confirmation hearings, Marco Rubio asked Tillerson if he would label Saudi Arabia as a \"human rights violator\". Tillerson declined to do so, saying: \"When you designate someone or label someone, is that the most effective way to have progress be able to be made in Saudi Arabia or any other country?\" He supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.\n\nTillerson announced in 2009 that ExxonMobil favored a carbon tax as \"the most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions—from investments made by companies to fuel their requirements to the product choices made by consumers\". In October 2016, less than two months before his nomination as Secretary of State, he reaffirmed that ExxonMobil believed a carbon tax would be \"the best policy of those being considered. Replacing the hodge-podge of current, largely ineffective regulations with a revenue-neutral carbon tax would ensure a uniform and predictable cost of carbon across the economy ... allow market forces to drive solutions ... maximize transparency, reduce administrative complexity, promote global participation and easily adjust\" to new knowledge in climate science and in the policy consequences of various courses of action.\n\nAn article in \"The New York Times\" suggested that ExxonMobil's embrace of a carbon tax in October 2009 may have simply been an effort to avoid cap and trade legislation that was then being considered by the U.S. Congress as an alternative method of carbon pricing. A \"Time\" magazine article in December 2016 asserted that since Tillerson announced his company's preference for a carbon tax, ExxonMobil \"has not made a carbon tax a focus of its massive lobbying efforts and has supported a number of candidates and organizations that oppose measures to tackle the [climate change] issue\".\n\nIn 2010, Tillerson said that while he acknowledged that humans were affecting the climate through greenhouse gas emissions to some degree, it was not yet clear \"to what extent and therefore what can you do about it\".\n\nIn 2016, Tillerson stated, \"The world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels, whether they like it or not.\"\n\nIn 2013, Tillerson outlined his support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), stating at the Global Security Forum: \"One of the most promising developments on this front is the ongoing effort for the Trans-Pacific Partnership ... The 11 nations that have been working to lower trade barriers and end protectionist policies under this partnership are a diverse mix of developed and developing economies. But all of them understand the value of open markets to growth and progress for every nation.\"\n\nSpeaking in March 2007 at a Council on Foreign Relations event, Tillerson said:\n\nShould the United States seek so-called energy independence in an elusive effort to insulate this country from the impact of world events on the economy, or should Americans pursue the path of international engagement, seeking ways to better compete within the global market for energy? Like the Council's founders, I believe we must choose the course of greater international engagement ... The central reality is this: The global free market for energy provides the most effective means of achieving U.S. energy security by promoting resource development, enabling diversification, multiplying our supply channels, encouraging efficiency, and spurring innovation.\n\nIn 2012 in an interview with \"The Wall Street Journal\", Tillerson expressed his impatience with government regulation, stating \"there are a thousand ways you can be told 'no' in this country.\"\n\nIn September 2013, Tillerson wrote an op-ed piece in \"The Wall Street Journal\" defending Common Core.\n\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, Tillerson has made tens of thousands of dollars of political donations to Republican groups and candidates. According to FEC records, he gave a total of $468,970 in contributions to Republican candidates and committees from 2000 to 2016.\n\nHe has contributed to the political campaigns of George W. Bush, as well as Mitt Romney in 2012, and Mitch McConnell. He did not donate to Donald Trump's campaign. He donated to Jeb Bush's campaign during the 2016 Republican primaries.\n\nRex Tillerson has been married twice. He divorced Jamie Lee Henry, his first wife, with whom he has twin boys. In 1986, Tillerson married Renda St. Clair, who has a son from her previous marriage. Tillerson also has a son, born in 1988, with St. Clair. Tillerson's twin sons are engineers and hold their bachelor's degrees from the Cockrell School of Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. In 2006, Tillerson was named a Distinguished Engineering Graduate.\n\nTillerson resides in Bartonville, Texas. Following his appointment as Secretary of State, Tillerson bought a home in Kalorama, Washington, D.C.\n\nHe is a Congregationalist who holds a membership in the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches, a mainline Reformed denomination.

Goeje (in Gyeongsangnam-do) is one of the largest shipyards in the world, having 3 dry docks, and 5 floating docks. A core subsidiary of the Samsung Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate, SHI's main focus is on the engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning and the delivery of: transportation ships for the commercial industry, topsides modules, drilling and floating production units for the oil and gas sector, gantry cranes for fabrication yards, digital instrumentaton and control devices for ships, and other construction and engineering services.\n\nSHI operates manufacturing facilities at home and abroad, including ship block fabrication factories in Ningbo and Rongcheng, China. The Geoje Shipyard in particular, SHI's largest shipyard in South Korea, boasts the highest dock turnover rate in the world. The largest of the three docks, Dock No. 3, is long, wide, and deep. Mostly ultra-large ships are built at this dock, having the world's highest production efficiency with yearly dock turnover rate of 10 and the launch of 30 ships per year.\n\nSHI specializes in the building of high added-value and special purpose vessels, including LNG carriers, off-shore related vessels, oil drilling ships, FPSO/FSO's, ultra Large container ships and Arctic shuttle tankers. In recent times SHI has concentrated on LNG tankers and drillships.\n\nSamsung Heavy Industries was established in 1974, when the company's Changwon plant was opened. SHI soon purchased Woojin, followed by the construction of Geoje shipbuilding facilities and merger with Daesung Heavy Industries.\n\nSamsung Shipbuilding and Daesung Heavy Industries were merged under Samsung Heavy Industries in 1983. Since then, it has put efforts in the introduction of new technologies and development of products, while expanding the business area into heavy equipment and construction.\n\nSince the 21st century, SHI began to build LNG and large passenger ships in earnest, and exported shipbuilding technologies to the United States. Samsung Heavy Industries decided to advance into the cruise ship market, the last remaining stronghold of EU shipbuilders. The company stated entering the undertaking was necessary to maintain its number one position in the global shipbuilding market. In 2009, SHI was contracted to build a new residential cruise ship named Utopia, which will be the largest passenger ship ever assembled in Asia. The ship will test the waters by 2016.\n\nStarting in the late 1980s, SHI produced forklifts and heavy equipment (mainly excavators) at Changwon. The forklift production was established through agreements with Clark Material Handling Company (production started in 1986) and the heavy equipment production came from the construction equipment division of Korea's Heavy Industries and Construction, acquired by Samsung in 1983 (SHI began manufacturing heavy equipment in 1987). Truck production was added in May 1993. The company also assembled electric car prototypes. The truck production business was spun off in 1996 as a separate company called Samsung Commercial Vehicles. The forklift and heavy equipment businesses were sold off in 1998.\n\nSamsung Heavy Industries has been involved in wind turbine manufacture including the S7.0-171 turbine, which in 2013 was the world's largest wind turbine . It is still one of the most powerful turbines on Earth.\n\n\n"}

Hydrogen and oxygen produced thus are stored to be used by a fuel cell to produce electricity when no sunlight is available.\n\nPhotovoltaic panels convert sunlight to electricity. In this cycle, the excess electricity produced after consumption by devices connected to the system, is used to power an electrolyzer. The electrolyzer converts water into hydrogen and oxygen, which is stored. This hydrogen is used up by a fuel cell to produce electricity, which can power the devices when sunlight is unavailable.\n\nThe Solar–Hydrogen energy cycle can be incorporated using organic thin film solar cells and microcrystalline silicon thin film solar cells This cycle can also be incorporated using photoelectrochemical solar cells. These solar have been incorporated since 1972 for hydrogen production and is capable of directly converting sunlight into chemical energy.\n\nAn aqueous solution of hydrogen iodide has been proposed as an alternative to water as a fuel that can be used in this cycle. Splitting of hydrogen iodide is easier than splitting water as its Gibbs energy change for decomposition is lesser. Hence silicon photoelectrodes can decompose hydrogen iodide into hydrogen and iodine without any external bias.\n\n\n"}

This is longitudinal static stability.\n\n\"Static margin\" is a concept used to characterize the static longitudinal stability and controllability of aircraft and missiles.\n\nIn aircraft analysis, static margin is defined as the distance between the center of gravity and the neutral point of the aircraft, expressed as a percentage of the mean aerodynamic chord of the wing. The greater this distance and the narrower the wing, the more stable the aircraft. Conventionally, the neutral point is aft of the c.g., although in rare cases (computer controlled fighter aircraft) it may be forward of the c.g., i.e. slightly unstable, to obtain quickness of response in combat. Too great longitudinal stability makes the aircraft \"stiff\" in pitch, resulting in such undesirable features as difficulty in obtaining the necessary stalled nose-up pitch when landing.\n\nThe position of the neutral point is found by taking the algebraic net moment of all horizontal surfaces, measured from the nose of the aircraft, in the same manner as the c.g. is determined, i.e. the sum of all such moments divided by their total area. The stabilizer and elevator dominate this result, but it is necessary to account for all surfaces such as fuselage, landing gear, prop-normal, etc. It is also necessary to take account of the center of pressure of the wing, which can move a good deal fore and aft as angle of attack of a flat-bottom wing section (Clark Y) changes, or not at all in the case of self-stabilizing sections such as the M6.\n\nThe neutral point in conventional aircraft is a short distance behind the c.g. (\"The feathers of the arrow must be at the back\"); but in unconventional aircraft such as canards and those with dual-wings, such as the Quickie, this will not be so. The overall rule stated above must hold, i.e. the neutral point must be aft of the c.g., wherever that may be. \n\nThe position of the center of gravity is determined by factors such as the positions of loads, e.g. passengers, fuel, weapons, etc.; whether such loads can vary, e.g. presence or absence of luggage, ammunition, etc.; and how fuel is consumed during flight. Additional information regarding the usual position of the neutral point aft of the center of gravity is at longitudinal static stability. (For an aircraft this may be described as positive static margin.) The response of an aircraft or missile to an angular disturbance such as a pitch disturbance is determined by its static margin.\n\nIn missile analysis, static margin is defined as the distance between the center of gravity and the center of pressure. Missiles are symmetric vehicles and if they have airfoils they too are symmetric. \n\nFor missiles, positive static margin implies that the complete vehicle makes a restoring moment for any angle of attack from the trim position. If the center of pressure is behind the center of gravity then the moment will be restoring. For missiles with symmetric airfoils, the neutral point and the center of pressure are coincident and the term neutral point is not used.\n\n\nThe first condition above is positive static stability. In missile analysis this is described as positive static margin. (In aircraft analysis it may be described as negative static margin.)\nThe second condition above is negative static stability. In missile analysis this is defined as negative static margin. (In aircraft analysis it may be described as positive static margin.) \n\nDepending on the static margin, humans may not be able to use control inputs to the elevators to control the pitch of the vehicle. Typically, computer based autopilots are required to control the vehicle when it has negative static stability - usually described as negative static margin.\n\nThe purpose of the reduced stability (low static margin) is to make an aircraft more responsive to pilot inputs. An aircraft with a large static margin will be very stable and slow to respond to the pilot inputs. The amount of static margin is an important factor in determining the handling qualities of an aircraft. For an unguided rocket, the vehicle must have a large positive static margin so the rocket shows minimum tendency to diverge from the direction of flight given to it at launch. In contrast, guided missiles usually have a negative static margin for increased maneuverability.\n\n"}

It is present as an olive green to black, odorless solid. It is one of the more popular forms of yellowcake and is shipped between mills and refineries in this form.\n\nUO has potential long-term stability in a geologic environment. In the presence of oxygen (O), uranium dioxide (UO) is oxidized to UO, whereas uranium trioxide (UO) loses oxygen at temperatures above 500 °C and is reduced to UO. The compound can be produced by any one of three primary chemical conversion processes, involving either uranium tetrafluoride (UF) or uranyl fluoride (UOF) as intermediates. It is generally considered to be the more attractive form for disposal purposes because, under normal environmental conditions, UO is one of the most kinetically and thermodynamically stable forms of uranium. Its particle density is 8.3 g cm.\n\nTriuranium octoxide is converted to uranium hexafluoride for the purpose of uranium enrichment.\n\nThe solid is a layered structure where the layers are bridged by oxygen atoms, each layer contains uranium atoms which are in different coordination environments.\n\nUsing a 6Å x 6Å x 6Å box with the uranium atom in the centre, the bond valence calculation was performed for both U1 and U2 in solid. It was found, using the parameters for U(VI), that the calculated oxidation states for U1 and U2 are 5.11 and 5.10. Using the parameters for U(IV), the calculated oxidation states are 5.78 and 5.77 for U1 and U2, respectively. These studies suggests that all the uranium atoms have the same oxidation state, so that the oxidation states are disordered through the lattice.\n"}
