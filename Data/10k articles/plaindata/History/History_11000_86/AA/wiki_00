It is often used interchangeably with the 1800s, though the start and end dates differ by a year.\n\nThe 19th century saw large amounts of social change; slavery was abolished, and the Second Industrial Revolution led to massive urbanization and much higher levels of productivity, profit and prosperity. European imperialism brought much of Asia and almost all of Africa under colonial rule.\n\nIt was marked by the collapse of the Spanish, Napoleonic, Holy Roman and Mughal empires. This paved the way for the growing influence of the British Empire, the Russian Empire, the United States, the German Empire (essentially replacing the Holy Roman Empire), the French colonial empire and Meiji Japan, with the British boasting unchallenged dominance after 1815. After the defeat of the French Empire and its allies in the Napoleonic Wars, the British and Russian empires expanded greatly, becoming the world's leading powers. The Russian Empire expanded in central and far eastern Asia. The British Empire grew rapidly in the first half of the century, especially with the expansion of vast territories in Canada, Australia, South Africa and heavily populated India, and in the last two decades of the century in Africa. By the end of the century, the British Empire controlled a fifth of the world's land and one quarter of the world's population. During the post-Napoleonic era, it enforced what became known as the Pax Britannica, which had ushered in unprecedented globalization and economic integration on a massive scale.\n\nThe first electronics appeared in the 19th century, with the introduction of the electric relay in 1835, the telegraph and its Morse code protocol in 1837, the first telephone call in 1876, and the first functional light bulb in 1878.\n\nThe 19th century was an era of rapidly accelerating scientific discovery and invention, with significant developments in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, electricity, and metallurgy that laid the groundwork for the technological advances of the 20th century. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and spread to continental Europe, North America and Japan. The Victorian era was notorious for the employment of young children in factories and mines, as well as strict social norms regarding modesty and gender roles. Japan embarked on a program of rapid modernization following the Meiji Restoration, before defeating China, under the Qing Dynasty, in the First Sino-Japanese War. and the understanding of human anatomy and disease prevention took place in the 19th century, and were partly responsible for rapidly accelerating population growth in the western world. Europe's population doubled during the 19th century, from approximately 200 million to more than 400 million. The introduction of railroads provided the first major advancement in land transportation for centuries, changing the way people lived and obtained goods, and fuelling major urbanization movements in countries across the globe. Numerous cities worldwide surpassed populations of a million or more during this century. London became the world's largest city and capital of the British Empire. Its population increased from 1 million in 1800 to 6.7 million a century later. The last remaining undiscovered landmasses of Earth, including vast expanses of interior Africa and Asia, were explored during this century, and with the exception of the extreme zones of the Arctic and Antarctic, accurate and detailed maps of the globe were available by the 1890s. Liberalism became the pre-eminent reform movement in Europe.\nSlavery was greatly reduced around the world. Following a successful slave revolt in Haiti, Britain and France stepped up the battle against the Barbary pirates and succeeded in stopping their enslavement of Europeans. The UK's Slavery Abolition Act charged the British Royal Navy with ending the global slave trade. The first colonial empire in the century to abolish slavery was the British, who did so in 1834. America's 13th Amendment following their Civil War abolished slavery there in 1865, and in Brazil slavery was abolished in 1888 (see Abolitionism). Similarly, serfdom was abolished in Russia.\n\nThe 19th century was remarkable in the widespread formation of new settlement foundations which were particularly prevalent across North America and Australia, with a significant proportion of the two continents' largest cities being founded at some point in the century. Chicago in the United States and Melbourne in Australia were non-existent in the earliest decades but grew to become the 2nd largest cities in the United States and British Empire respectively by the end of the century. In the 19th century approximately 70 million people left Europe, with most migrating to the United States.\n\nThe 19th century also saw the rapid creation, development and codification of many sports, particularly in Britain and the United States. Association football, rugby union, baseball and many other sports were developed during the 19th century, while the British Empire facilitated the rapid spread of sports such as cricket to many different parts of the world. Also, ladywear was a very sensitive topic during this time, where women showing their ankles was viewed to be scandalous.\nIt also marks the fall of the Ottoman rule of the Balkans which led to the creation of Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Romania as a result of the second Russo-Turkish War, which in itself followed the great Crimean War.\n\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars were a series of major conflicts from 1803 to 1815 pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, financed and usually led by the United Kingdom. The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and its resultant conflict.\n\nIn the aftermath of the French Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte gained power in France in 1799. In 1804, he crowned himself Emperor of the French.\n\nIn 1805, the French victory over an Austrian-Russian army at the Battle of Austerlitz ended the War of the Third Coalition. As a result of the Treaty of Pressburg, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved.\n\nLater efforts were less successful. In the Peninsular War, France unsuccessfully attempted to establish Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain. In 1812, the French invasion of Russia had massive French casualties, and was a turning point in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nIn 1814, after defeat in the War of the Sixth Coalition, Napoleon abdicated and was exiled to Elba. Later that year, he escaped exile and began the Hundred Days before finally being defeated at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to Saint Helena, an island in the South Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAfter Napoleon's defeat, the Congress of Vienna was held to determine new national borders. The Concert of Europe attempted to preserve this settlement was established to preserve these borders, with limited impact.\n\nMost countries in Central America and South America obtained independence from colonial overlords during the 19th century. In 1804, Haiti gained independence from France. In Mexico, the Mexican War of Independence was a decade-long conflict that ended in Mexican independence in 1821.\n\nDue to the Napoleonic Wars, the royal family of Portugal relocated to Brazil from 1808-1821, leading to Brazil having a separate monarchy from Portugal.\n\nThe Federal Republic of Central America gained independence from Spain in 1821 and from Mexico in 1823. After several rebellions, by 1841 the federation had dissolved into the independent countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.\n\nIn 1830, the post-colonial nation of Gran Colombia dissolved and the nations of Colombia (including modern-day Panama), Ecuador, and Venezuela took its place.\n\nThe Revolutions of 1848 were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848. The revolutions were essentially democratic and liberal in nature, with the aim of removing the old monarchical structures and creating independent nation states.\n\nThe first revolution began in January in Sicily. Revolutions then spread across Europe after a separate revolution began in France in February. Over 50 countries were affected, but with no coordination or cooperation among their respective revolutionaries.\n\nAccording to Evans and von Strandmann (2000), some of the major contributing factors were widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership, demands for more participation in government and democracy, demands for freedom of the press, other demands made by the working class, the upsurge of nationalism, and the regrouping of established government forces.\n\nThe abolitionism movement achieved success in the 19th century. The Atlantic slave trade was abolished in 1808, and by the end of the century, almost every government had banned slavery. The Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 banned slavery throughout the British Empire, and the Lei Áurea abolished slavery in Brazil in 1888.\n\nThe American Civil War took place from 1861-1865. Eleven southern states seceded from the United States, largely over concerns related to slavery. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln issued a preliminary on September 22, 1862 warning that in all states still in rebellion (Confederacy) on January 1, 1863, he would declare their slaves \"then, thenceforward, and forever free.\" The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1865, officially abolished slavery in the entire country.\n\nFive days after Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia, Lincoln was assassinated by actor and Confederate sympathiser John Wilkes Booth.\n\nIn 1830, Greece became the first country to break away from the Ottoman Empire after the Greek War of Independence. In 1831, the Great Bosnian uprising against Ottoman rule occurred. In 1817, the Principality of Serbia became suzerain from the Ottoman Empire, and in 1867, it passed a Constitution which defined its independence from the Ottoman Empire. In 1876, Bulgarians instigate the April Uprising against Ottoman rule. Following the Russo-Turkish War, the Treaty of Berlin recognized the formal independence of the Principality of Serbia, Montenegro and Romania. Bulgaria becomes autonomous.\n\nThe Taiping Rebellion was the bloodiest conflict of the 19th century, leading to the deaths of 20 million people. Its leader, Hong Xiuquan, declared himself the younger brother of Jesus Christ and developed a new Chinese religion known as the God Worshipping Society. After proclaiming the establishment of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in 1851, the Taiping army conquered a large part of China, capturing Nanjing in 1853. In 1864, after the death of Hong Xiuquan, Qing forces recaptured Nanjing and ended the rebellion.\n\nDuring the Edo period, Japan largely pursued an isolationist foreign policy. In 1853, United States Navy Commodore Matthew C. Perry threatened the Japanese capital Edo with gunships, demanding that they agree to open trade. This led to the opening of trade relations between Japan and foreign countries, with the policy of Sakoku formally ended in 1854.\n\nBy 1872, the Japanese government under Emperor Meiji had eliminated the \"daimyō\" system and established a strong central government. Further reforms included the abolishment of the samurai class, rapid industrialization and modernization of government, closely following European models.\n\nIn 1862, French gained its first foothold in Southeast Asia, and in 1863 France annexes Cambodia.\n\n\nIn Africa, European exploration and technology led to the colonization of almost the entire continent by 1898. New medicines such as quinine and more advanced firearms allowed European nations to conquer native populations.\n\nMotivations for the Scramble for Africa included national pride, desire for raw materials, and Christian missionary activity. Britain seized control of Egypt to ensure control of the Suez Canal. France, Belgium, Portugal, and Germany also had substantial colonies. The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 attempted to reach agreement on colonial borders in Africa, but disputes continued, both amongst European powers and in resistance by the native population.\n\nIn 1867, diamonds were discovered in the Kimberley region of South Africa. In 1886, gold was discovered in Transvaal. This led to colonization in Southern Africa by the British and business interests, led by Cecil Rhodes.\n\n\nThe 19th century saw the birth of science as a profession; the term scientist was coined in 1833 by William Whewell, which soon replaced the older term of (natural) philosopher. Among the most influential ideas of the 19th century were those of Charles Darwin (alongside the independent researches of Alfred Russel Wallace), who in 1859 published the book \"The Origin of Species\", which introduced the idea of evolution by natural selection. Another important landmark in medicine and biology were the successful efforts to prove the germ theory of disease. Following this, Louis Pasteur made the first vaccine against rabies, and also made many discoveries in the field of chemistry, including the asymmetry of crystals. In chemistry, Dmitri Mendeleev, following the atomic theory of John Dalton, created the first periodic table of elements. In physics, the experiments, theories and discoveries of Michael Faraday, André-Marie Ampère, James Clerk Maxwell, and their contemporaries led to the creation of electromagnetism as a new branch of science. Thermodynamics led to an understanding of heat and the notion of energy was defined. Other highlights include the discoveries unveiling the nature of atomic structure and matter, simultaneously with chemistry – and of new kinds of radiation. In astronomy, the planet Neptune was discovered. In mathematics, the notion of complex numbers finally matured and led to a subsequent analytical theory; they also began the use of hypercomplex numbers. Karl Weierstrass and others carried out the arithmetization of analysis for functions of real and complex variables. It also saw rise to new progress in geometry beyond those classical theories of Euclid, after a period of nearly two thousand years. The mathematical science of logic likewise had revolutionary breakthroughs after a similarly long period of stagnation. But the most important step in science at this time were the ideas formulated by the creators of electrical science. Their work changed the face of physics and made possible for new technology to come about: Thomas Alva Edison gave the world a practical everyday lightbulb. Nikola Tesla pioneered the induction motor, high frequency transmission of electricity, and remote control. Other new inventions were electrical telegraphy and the telephone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the literary front the new century opens with romanticism, a movement that spread throughout Europe in reaction to 18th-century rationalism, and it develops more or less along the lines of the Industrial Revolution, with a design to react against the dramatic changes wrought on nature by the steam engine and the railway. William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge are considered the initiators of the new school in England, while in the continent the German \"Sturm und Drang\" spreads its influence as far as Italy and Spain. French arts had been hampered by the Napoleonic Wars but subsequently developed rapidly. Modernism began.\n\nThe Goncourts and Émile Zola in France and Giovanni Verga in Italy produce some of the finest naturalist novels. Italian naturalist novels are especially important in that they give a social map of the new unified Italy to a people that until then had been scarcely aware of its ethnic and cultural diversity. There was a huge literary output during the 19th century. Some of the most famous writers included the Russians Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky; the English Charles Dickens, John Keats, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Jane Austen; the Scottish Sir Walter Scott; the Irish Oscar Wilde; the Americans Edgar Allan Poe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Mark Twain; and the French Victor Hugo, Honoré de Balzac, Jules Verne, Alexandre Dumas and Charles Baudelaire.\n\n\nThe Realism and Romanticism of the early 19th century gave way to Impressionism and Post-Impressionism in the later half of the century, with Paris being the dominant art capital of the world. In the United States the Hudson River School was prominent. 19th-century painters included:\n\nSonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century. Much of the music from the 19th century was referred to as being in the Romantic style. Many great composers lived through this era such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Liszt, Frédéric Chopin, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Richard Wagner. The list includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th century was host to a variety of religious and philosophical thinkers, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He derived that reputation not from the writing of popular histories or media appearances but from his abilities as a linguist, economic historian, archival researcher, historical narrator and political scientist. He made an essential contribution to the understanding of modern European history and integration: the elements that went to shape contemporary Europe.\n\nAlthough he is usually seen as an economic historian, he worked in many other fields, including economic theory and policy, economic and political history, contemporary economic and political studies. He was a very rigorous modern political economist.\n\nMilward was born and raised in Stoke-on-Trent, where his father was an employee of the Post Office, and attended a grammar school there.\n\nHe studied medieval and modern history at University College London from 1953 to 1956, gaining a First Class BA degree and then achieved his PhD at the London School of Economics in 1960, with a thesis written under supervision of W. Norton Medlicott on the armaments industry in the German economy during the Second World War.\n\nHis first academic placement was the teaching of Indian Archaeology at the School of Oriental and African Studies. In 1960, he was given the position of assistant lecturer and subsequently lecturer in Economic History at Edinburgh University. In 1965, he advanced to become lecturer and later senior lecturer at the School of Social Studies, University of East Anglia. He then moved to the United States to become an associate professor of economics at Stanford University, returning after three years to become Professor of European Studies at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology between 1971 and 1983. He was then a professor at the European University Institute in Florence for two terms, between 1983 and 1986 and between 1996 and 2002.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1996, he was Professor of Economic History at the London School of Economics. In 1993, he was given the position of official historian at the Cabinet Office, and he produced the first volume of the Government Official History of the United Kingdom and the European Community, \"The Rise and Fall of a National Strategy 1945-1963\", published in 2002.\n\nHe was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1987 and fellow of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1994.\n\nHe gained a reputation for his ability to articulate and sustain his theses, which differed considerably from the received wisdom, and to refute arguments against his position. His interpretations caused widespread debate and discussion. An example was his minimalist contention that the Marshall Plan had been less crucial than often supposed in stimulating postwar European reconstruction or persuading former antagonists to work together.\n\nIn his book \"The European Rescue of the Nation State\" (1992), he also challenged the eurosceptic doctrine that the European Union would involve an integration of nation-states that would undermine sovereignty and lead to a federalist superstate. He influenced many historians and political scientists, not least Andrew Moravcsik's Choice for Europe. \n\nHe had a gift for languages, becoming fluent in Norwegian, German, Italian and French.\n\nAs well as several monographs, Milward wrote reviews of a vast number of books which bore some relation to his fields of expertise, collected in \"Alan S. Milward and Contemporary European History: Collected Academic Reviews\", eds. F. Guirao and F. Lynch (Routledge, 2015).\n\nHe died after a long illness, which had begun in October 2007.\n\nHis life's work was reviewed in depth in \"Alan S. Milward and a Century of European Change\", eds. F. Guirao, F. Lynch, & S. M. R. Perez (Routledge, 2012). \n\nHis second marriage was to Frances MB Lynch, a historian of the economies of France and Europe.\n\n"}

The earliest is a 12th-century presumed copy of a mid-10th century original; later editions were compiled in the 13th century. Despite the name, the \"Annales Cambriae\" record not only events in Wales, but also events in Ireland, Cornwall, England, Scotland and sometimes further afield, though the focus of the events recorded especially in the later two-thirds of the text is Wales.\n\nThe principal versions of \"Annales Cambriae\" appear in four manuscripts:\n\nA: London, British Library, MS. Harleian 3859, folios 190r-193r.<br>\nB: London (Kew), National Archives, MS. E.164/1 (K.R. Misc. Books, Series I) pp. 2–26<br>\nC: London, British Library, MS.

B commences its annals with Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain \"sixty years before the incarnation of the Lord.\" After A.D. 457, B agrees closely with A until A ends. C commences its annals after the empire of Heraclius (AD 610-41) at a year corresponding to AD 677. C mostly agrees with A until A ends, although it is clear that A was not the common source for B and C (Dumville 2002, p. xi). B and C diverge after 1203, C having fewer and briefer Welsh entries.\n\nD and E are found in a manuscript written at the Cistercian abbey of Whitland in south-west Wales in the later 13th century; the \"Cronica ante aduentum Domini\" (which takes its title from its opening words) extends from 1132 BC to 1285 AD, while the \"Cronica de Wallia\" extends from 1190 to 1266.\n\nA alone has benefited from a complete diplomatic edition (Phillimore 1888).\n\nThere are two entries in the \"Annales\" on King Arthur, one on Medraut (Mordred), and one on Merlin. These entries have been presented in the past as proof of the existence of Arthur and Merlin, although that view is no longer widely held because the Arthurian entries could have been added arbitrarily as late as 970, long after the development of the early Arthurian myth.\n\nThe entries on Arthur and Mordred in the A Text:\n\nConcerning Arthur's cross at the Battle of Badon, it is mirrored by a passage in Nennius where Arthur was said to have borne the image of the Virgin Mary \"on his shoulders\" during a battle at a castle called Guinnion. The words for \"shoulder\" and \"shield\" were, however, easily confused in Old Welsh \"*scuit\" \"shield\" versus *\"scuid\" \"shoulder\" and Geoffrey of Monmouth played upon this dual tradition, describing Arthur bearing \"on his shoulders a shield\" emblazoned with the Virgin.\n\nMerlin (Old Welsh Merdin) is not mentioned in the A Text, though there is mention of the battle of Arfderydd, associated with him in medieval Welsh literature:\n\nTexts B and C omit the second half of the year 93 entry. B calls Arfderydd \"Erderit\"; C, \"Arderit\". In the B Text, the year 129 entry continues: \"between the sons of Elifer and Guendoleu son of Keidau in which battle Guendoleu fell and Merlin went mad\". Both the B and C texts display the influence of Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", and this is reflected in the Arfderydd entry by the choice of the Latinized form \"Merlinus\", first found in Geoffrey's \"Historia\", as opposed to the expected Old Welsh form \"Merdin\".\n\n\n\n"}

In the fall of 1959 he started studying history at the University.\n\nAfter having written his research work :\"The development of the National Liberation Movement in Slavonia 1941-1943\" on September 1, 1964 he was transferred to the Military Historical Institute and was promoted to Senior Researcher in Military History. The University of Pristina promoted him to Master of Arts on the ground of his research work in the history of Second World War in Yugoslavia, and particularly on the ground of his books on the Jasenovac concentration camp and his title of Senior Researcher and approved his application to defend his doctor's thesis entitled : \"wehrmacht and the partisan War\". He was one of the most active members of the committee of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts for the collection of documents on the genocide against Serbs and other peoples in Yugoslavia, in the 20th century, from 1986 to 1994, when the committee ceased its work. He was a member of the Historical committee of the Russell's Tribunal for Yugoslavia. He is a founding member and Chairman of the Association for Research into Genocide and the war crimes, founded in Belgrade. For many years he was a collaborator and friend of Vladimir Dedijer, President of the Russell's Tribunal. Dedijer dedicated to Miletić his book :\" The Vatican and Jasenovac\" and expressed him his \"deepest gratitude\" for his work on the history of the Jasenovac concentration camp 1941-1945. So far, Antun Miletić has published 24 books, over 60 papers and dozens of articles and serials in daily and weekly press. He has also participated in numerous other projects as collaborator, editor, reviewer and member of editorial boards, Presently, he is Chairman of the Advisory Board Jasenovac, Research Institute, Brooklyn, New York. His historical work on World War II is today regarded with some skepticism, as his calculated death toll for the main Croatian concentration camp was more than 10 times the maximum range currently accepted by the US Holocaust memorial museum and almost all other modern sources.\n\n"}

Two Egyptian motor torpedo boats were sunk in the action for no Israeli losses.\n\nFollowing Israel's victory in the Six-Day War, Israel's coastline was significantly enlarged and now included the Sinai Peninsula coast. The Israeli Navy now sought to enforce Israeli sovereignty over this large area and began regular patrols of the Sinai coastline up to the approaches of Port Said.\n\nOn July 9 , an ex-British Royal Navy Z-class destroyer commanded by Yitzhak Shushan, set sail due west toward the Sinai coast. INS \"Eilat\" subsequently rendezvoused with ex-French motor torpedo boats \"Aya\" and \"Daya\". The flotilla patrolled northwest of the Sinai coast, under orders to stop vessels crossing the demarkation line toward the Sinai coast.\n\nOn July 11 at approximately 21:45, the signals intelligence intercept operator in \"Eilat\" reported two Egyptian missile boats were about to sortie. The Israeli torpedo boats picked up a target on radar shortly thereafter. The Egyptians were about 15 miles from the MTBs and 12 miles from \"Eilat\", moving east at . The Israelis marked a course to intercept. \"Eilat\" closed from the north, \"Aya\" and \"Daya\" from the east. The Egyptian vessels, later identified as P 6-class torpedo boats, discovered the Israeli MTBs approaching at full speed and commenced fire. The Israelis returned fire with Bofors and Oerlikons. The initial run scored no hits but the Egyptian MTBs dispersed. The separation enabled \"Eilat\" to close one and the two MTBs the other. Twenty minutes later, both P 6s were ablaze. The fire caused their torpedoes to explode. There were no Israeli losses and no known Egyptian survivors.\n"}

On 31 March 1937 the Nationalists started their offensive against the Republican held province of Biscay. As part of the offensive the \"Aviazione Legionaria\" and the \"Legion Condor\" bombed Durango: A town of 10.000 that was also a key road and railway junction behind the frontline. Around 250 people is believed to have died in the bombing.\n\nOn 31 March 1937, the Nationalist forces, led by Emilio Mola, started the offensive against the Republican held, Vizcaya Province. Mola said that: \"I have decided to terminate rapidly the war in the north: those not guilty of assassinations and who surrender their arms will have their lives and property spared. But, if submission is not immediate, I will raze all Vizcaya to the ground, beginning with the industries of war\". The same day the Nationalist bombed the towns of Durango and Elorrio.\n\nDurango a town of 10,000 inhabitants was a road and railway junction between Bilbao and the front. By bombing the road and infrastructure in the town, the Republican forces would be prevented from sending reinforcements from Bilbao. It would also ensure that the Basque and Republican troops couldn't retreat in an orderly fashion in order to fight another day.\n\nDespite the importance of Durango as a transportation junction, the town had no air defences, and the were only a few Republican fighterplanes to be found in the Basque region. \n\nOn 31 March, German and Italian transport planes modified to carry bombs (German Ju 52 and Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.81) from the \"Condor Legion\" and the \"Aviazione Legionaria\" bombed the town in relays. Two churches were bombed during the celebration of mass, killing 14 nuns and the officiated priest. Furthermore, Heinkel He 51 fighters strafed fleeing civilians. Altogether, around 250 civilians (Thomas: 248; Beevor: 250 and Preston: 258) died in the attack.\n\nOn 28 April, Durango fell to Nationalist side. While the local roadjunction meant that Durango was a legitimate target for an air attack and the bombing didn't contravene the laws of war as they were at the time, foreign observers were shocked at the carnage. \n\nThe Nationalists denied responsibility for the bombing, claiming that the priest and the nuns thay died in the bombing were killed and burned by the \"reds\". Queipo de llano said that: \"our planes bombed military objectives in Durango, and later communists and socialists locked up the priests and nuns, shooting without pity and burning the churches\". \n\nThe bombing of Durango was to a certain extent overlooked historically. \nInstead, it was the bombing of Guernica, a similar air attack that took place only a few weeks later, that got to symbolize the horrors of modern aerial warfare in the public consciousness.\n\n"}
{"id": "4379785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4379785", "title": "Classical demography", "text": "Classical demography\n\nClassical demography refers to the study of human demography in the Classical period. It often focuses on the absolute number of people who were alive in civilizations around the Mediterranean Sea between the Bronze Age and the fall of the Western Roman Empire, but in recent decades historians have been more interested in trying to analyse demographic processes such as the birth and death rates or the sex ratio of ancient populations. The period was characterized by an explosion in population with the rise of the Greek and Roman civilizations followed by a steep decline caused by economic and social disruption, migrations, and a return to primarily subsistence agriculture. Demographic questions play an important role in determining the size and structure of the economy of Ancient Greece and the Roman economy.\n\nBeginning in the 8th century BC, Greek city-states began colonizing the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts. Whether this sudden phenomenon was due to overpopulation, severe droughts, or an escape for vanquished people (or a combination) is still in question.\n\nThe population of the entire Greek civilization (Greece, the Greek-speaking populations of Sicily, the coast of western Asia Minor, and the Black Sea) in the 4th century BC was recently estimated to be 500,000 to 600,000.\n\nThe geographical definition of Greece has fluctuated over time. While today the ancient kingdom of Macedonia is always considered part of the Greek world, in the Classical Period it was a distinct entity and even though Macedonians spoke Greek, they were not considered as a part of Greece by some Athenian writers. Similarly, almost all modern residents of historical Ionia, now part of Turkey, speak the Turkish language, although from the 1st millennium BC Ionia was densely populated by Greek-speaking people and an important part of Greek culture.\n\nEstimates of the population of Greek speakers in the coast and islands of the Aegean Sea during the 5th century BC vary from 800,000 to over 3,000,000. In Athens and Attica in the 5th century BC, there were at least 150,000 Athenians, around 50,000 aliens, and more than 100,000 slaves or perhaps higher in the range of 350,000 to 500,000 people, of which 160,000 normally resided inside the city and port. These are not accurate statistics.\n\nThe ancient Roman province of Cyrenaica in the eastern region of present-day Libya was home to many several hundred thousand Greek, Latin and native communities. Originally settled by Greek colonists, five important settlements (Cyrene, Barca, Euesperides, Apollonia, and Tauchira) formed a pentapolis. The fertility of the land, the exportation of silphium, and its location between Carthage and Alexandria made it a magnet for settlement.\n\nPhoenicia also established colonies along the Mediterranean, including Carthage.\n\nWhen urbanization began to take place, it was Pella which became the largest city. Kingdom of Macedonia had 4 million people after the Wars of the Diadochi.\n\nGreek historian Diodorus Siculus estimated that 7,000,000 inhabitants resided in Egypt during his lifetime before its annexation by the Roman Empire. Of this, he states that 300,000 citizens lived within the city of Alexandria.\n\nThe population of the vast Seleucid Empire has been estimated to have been higher than 30 million.\n\nThere are many estimates of the population for the Roman Empire, that range from 45 million to 120 million with 55-65 million as the most accepted range. \n\n\"An estimated population of the empire during the reign of Augustus:\"\n\"Beloch's 1886 estimate for the population of the empire during the reign of Augustus:\"\n\"Russell's 1958 estimate for the population of the empire in 1 AD:\"\n\"Russell's 1958 estimate for the population of the empire in 350 AD:\"\nThe total population of Roman Italy (south of the Po Valley) was estimated to be around 4 million before the Second Punic War. The figure is approximate: the Romans carried out a regular census of citizens eligible for military service (Polybius 2.23), but for the population of the rest of Italy at this time we have to rely on a single report of the military strength of Rome's allies in 227 BC - and guess the numbers of those who were opposed to Rome at this time. The citizen count in the second century B.C. hovered between 250-325,000 presumably males over the age of 13.\n\nThe census of 70/69 B.C. records 910,000 presumably due to the extension of citizenship to the allies after the Social War of 91-88. Still, even if only males this seems like an undercount. For the 1st and 2nd centuries BC, historians have developed two radically different accounts, resting on different interpretations of the figures of 4,036,000 recorded for the census carried out by Augustus in 28 BC, 4,233,000 in 8 BC, and 4,937,000 in 14 AD. and almost 6 million during the reign of Claudius, not all of whom lived in Italy. Many lived in Spain, Gaul and other parts of the Empire. If this only represents adult male citizens (or some subset of adult male citizens those over age 13 as the census traditionally did not count children until they were formally enrolled as citizens early in puberty), then the population of Italy must have been around 10 million, not including slaves and foreigners, which was a striking, sustained increase despite the Romans' losses in the almost constant wars over the previous two centuries. Others find this entirely incredible, and argue that the census must now be counting all citizens, male and female over the age of 13 - in which case the population had declined slightly, something which can readily be attributed to war casualties and to the crisis of the Italian peasantry. The majority of historians favour the latter interpretation as being more demographically plausible, but the issue remains contentious.\n\nEstimates for the population of mainland Italia, including Gallia Cisalpina, at the beginning of the 1st Century AD range from 6,000,000 according to Beloch in 1886, 6,830,000 according to Russell in 1958, less than 10,000,000 according to Hin in 2007, and 14,000,000 according to Lo Cascio in 2009.\n\nEvidence for the population of Rome itself or of the other cities of Roman Italy is equally scarce. For the capital, estimates have been based on the number of houses listed in 4th-century AD guidebooks, on the size of the built-up area, and on the volume of the water supply, all of which are problematic; the best guess is based on the number of recipients of the grain dole under Augustus, 200,000, implying a population of around 800,000-1,200,000. Italy had numerous urban centres - over 400 are listed by Pliny the Elder - but the majority were small, with populations of just a few thousand. As much as 40% of the population might have lived in towns (25% if the city of Rome is excluded), on the face of it an astonishingly high level of urbanisation for a pre-industrial society. However, studies of later periods would not count the smallest centres as 'urban'; if only cities of 10,000+ are counted, Italy's level of urbanisation was a more realistic (but still impressive) 25% (11% excluding Rome).\n\n\nAncient Greece\n\nRoman Republic and Empire\n"}
{"id": "9097253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9097253", "title": "Digital Revolution", "text": "Digital Revolution\n\nThe Digital Revolution, also known as the Third Industrial Revolution, is the shift from mechanical and analogue electronic technology to digital electronics which began anywhere from the late 1950s to the late 1970s with the adoption and proliferation of digital computers and digital record keeping that continues to the present day. Implicitly, the term also refers to the sweeping changes brought about by digital computing and communication technology during (and after) the latter half of the 20th century. Analogous to the Agricultural Revolution and Industrial Revolution, the Digital Revolution marked the beginning of the Information Age.\n\nCentral to this revolution is the mass production and widespread use of digital logic circuits, and its derived technologies, including the computer, digital cellular phone, and the Internet. These technological innovations have transformed traditional production and business techniques.\n\nThe notion of the digital revolution is part of the Schumpeterian theory of socio-economic evolution, which consists of an incessant process of creative destruction that modernizes the modus operandi of society as a whole, including its economic, social, cultural, and political organization.\n\nThe motor of this incessant force of creative destruction is technological change. While the key carrier technology of the first Industrial Revolution (1770–1850) was based on water-powered mechanization, the second Kondratiev wave (1850–1900) was enabled by steam-powered technology, the third (1900–1940) was characterized by the electrification of social and productive organization, the fourth by motorization and the automated mobilization of society (1940–1970), and the most recent one by the digitization of social systems. Each one of those so-called long waves has been characterized by a sustained period of social modernization, most notably by sustained periods of increasing economic productivity. According to Carlota Perez: \"this quantum jump in productivity can be seen as a technological revolution, which is made possible by the appearance in the general cost structure of a particular input that we could call the 'key factor', fulfilling the following conditions: (1) clearly perceived low-and descending-relative cost; (2) unlimited supply for all practical purposes; (3) potential all-pervasiveness; (4) a capacity to reduce the costs of capital, labour and products as well as to change them qualitatively\". Digital Information and Communication Technologies fulfill those requirements and therefore represent a general purpose technology that can transform an entire economy, leading to a modern, and more developed form of socio-economic and political organization often referred to as the post-industrial society, the fifth Kondratiev, Information society, digital age, and network society, among others.\n\nThe Agricultural Revolution led to agricultural cities in the ancient world in the Middle East, Mesoamerica, China, the Indus Valley, Southern Europe and South America.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution and Digital Revolution are now taking place concurrently in China and India as people leave the rural areas for industrial and high tech cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Mumbai.\n\nThe underlying technology was invented in the later half of the 19th century, including Babbage's analytical engine and the telegraph. Digital communication became economical for widespread adoption after the invention of the personal computer. Claude Shannon, a Bell Labs mathematician, is credited for having laid out the foundations of digitalization in his pioneering 1948 article, \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\". The digital revolution converted technology that had been analog into a digital format. By doing this, it became possible to make copies that were identical to the original. In digital communications, for example, repeating hardware was able to amplify the digital signal and pass it on with no loss of information in the signal. Of equal importance to the revolution was the ability to easily move the digital information between media, and to access or distribute it remotely.\n\nThe turning point of the revolution was the change from analogue to digitally recorded music. During the 1980s the digital format of optical compact discs gradually replaced analog formats, such as vinyl records and cassette tapes, as the popular medium of choice.\n\nIn 1947, the transistor was invented, leading the way to more advanced digital computers. From the late 1940s, Universities, the Military, and Business developed computer systems, to digitally replicate and automate previously manually performed mathematical calculations, with the LEO (computer) being the first commercially available general purpose computer.\n\nA key step toward mass commercialization was the advent of the planar process in 1959 by Jean Hoerni, an employee of Fairchild Semiconductor. This enabled integrated circuits to be mass produced using the techniques of photolithography. \n\nFrom 1969 to 1971, Intel developed the Intel 4004, an early microprocessor that laid the foundations for the microcomputer revolution that began in the 1970s.\n\nThe public was first introduced to the concepts that would lead to the Internet when a message was sent over the ARPANET in 1969. Packet switched networks such as ARPANET, Mark I, CYCLADES, Merit Network, Tymnet, and Telenet, were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols. The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks.\n\nThe Whole Earth movement of the 1960s advocated the use of new technology.\n\nIn the 1970s, the home computer was introduced, time-sharing computers, the video game console, the first coin-op video games, and the golden age of arcade video games began with Space Invaders. As digital technology proliferated, and the switch from analog to digital record keeping became the new standard in business, a relatively new job description was popularized, the data entry clerk. Culled from the ranks of secretaries and typists from earlier decades, the data entry clerk's job was to convert analog data (customer records, invoices, etc.) into digital data.\n\nIn developed nations, computers achieved semi-ubiquity during the 1980s as they made their way into schools, homes, business, and industry. Automated teller machines, industrial robots, CGI in film and television, electronic music, bulletin board systems, and video games all fueled what became the zeitgeist of the 1980s. Millions of people purchased home computers, making household names of early personal computer manufacturers such as Apple, Commodore, and Tandy. To this day the Commodore 64 is often cited as the best selling computer of all time, having sold 17 million units (by some accounts) between 1982 and 1994.\n\nIn 1984, the U.S. Census Bureau began collecting data on computer and Internet use in the United States; their first survey showed that 8.2% of all U.S. households owned a personal computer in 1984, and that households with children under the age of 18 were nearly twice as likely to own one at 15.3% (middle and upper middle class households were the most likely to own one, at 22.9%). By 1989, 15% of all U.S. households owned a computer, and nearly 30% of households with children under the age of 18 owned one. By the late 1980s, many businesses were dependent on computers and digital technology.\n\nMotorola created the first mobile phone, Motorola DynaTac, in 1983. However, this device used analog communication - digital cell phones were not sold commercially until 1991 when the 2G network started to be opened in Finland to accommodate the unexpected demand for cell phones that was becoming apparent in the late 1980s.\n\nCompute! magazine predicted that CD-ROM would be the centerpiece of the revolution, with multiple household devices reading the discs.\n\nThe first true digital camera was created in 1988, and the first were marketed in December 1989 in Japan and in 1990 in the United States. By the mid-2000s, they would eclipse traditional film in popularity.\n\nDigital ink was also invented in the late 1980s. Disney's CAPS system (created 1988) was used for a scene in 1989's The Little Mermaid and for all their animation films between 1990's The Rescuers Down Under and 2004's Home On The Range.\n\nTim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.\n\nThe first public digital HDTV broadcast was of the 1990 World Cup that June; it was played in 10 theaters in Spain and Italy. However HDTV did not become a standard until the mid-2000s outside Japan.\n\nThe World Wide Web became publicly accessible in 1991, which had been available only to government and universities. In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina introduced Mosaic, the first web browser capable of displaying inline images and the basis for later browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. The Internet expanded quickly, and by 1996, it was part of mass culture and many businesses listed websites in their ads. By 1999 almost every country had a connection, and nearly half of Americans and people in several other countries used the Internet on a regular basis. However throughout the 1990s, \"getting online\" entailed complicated configuration, and dial-up was the only connection type affordable by individual users; the present day mass Internet culture was not possible.\n\nIn 1989 about 15% of all households in the United States owned a personal computer, by 2000, this was up to 51%; for households with children nearly 30% owned a computer in 1989, and in 2000 65% owned one.\n\nCell phones became as ubiquitous as computers by the early 2000s, with movie theaters beginning to show ads telling people to silence their phones. They also became much more advanced than phones of the 1990s, most of which only took calls or at most allowed for the playing of simple games.\n\nText messaging existed in the 1990s but was not widely used until the early 2000s, when it became a cultural phenomenon.\n\nThe digital revolution became truly global in this time as well - after revolutionizing society in the developed world in the 1990s, the digital revolution spread to the masses in the developing world in the 2000s.\n\nIn late 2005 the population of the Internet reached 1 billion, and 3 billion people worldwide used cell phones by the end of the decade. HDTV became the standard television broadcasting format in many countries by the end of the decade.\n\nBy 2012, over 2 billion people used the Internet, twice the number using it in 2007. Cloud computing had entered the mainstream by the early 2010s. By 2015, tablet computers and smartphones were expected to exceed personal computers in Internet usage. By 2016, half of the world's population was connected.\n\nIn the late 1980s, less than 1% of the world's technologically stored information was in digital format, while it was 94% in 2007, with more than 99% by 2014. The year 2002 is estimated to be the year when human kind was able to store more information in digital, than in analog format (the \"beginning of the digital age\").\n\nIt is estimated that the world's capacity to store information has increased from 2.6 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1986, to some 5,000 exabytes in 2014 (5 zettabytes).\n\n\n\n\nConversion of below analog technologies to digital. (The decade indicated is the period when digital became dominant form.)\n\n\nDecline or disappearance of below analog technologies:\n\nDisappearance of other technologies also attributed to digital revolution. (Analog–digital classification doesn't apply to these.)\n\n\nImprovements in digital technologies.\n\nUnderlying the digital revolution was the development of the digital electronic computer, the personal computer, and particularly the microprocessor with its steadily increasing performance (as described by Moore's law), which enabled computer technology to be embedded into a huge range of objects from cameras to personal music players. Equally important was the development of transmission technologies including computer networking, the Internet and digital broadcasting. 3G phones, whose social penetration grew exponentially in the 2000s, also played a very large role in the digital revolution as they simultaneously provide ubiquitous entertainment, communications, and online connectivity.\n\nPositive aspects include greater interconnectedness, easier communication, and the exposure of information that in the past could have more easily been suppressed by totalitarian regimes. Michio Kaku wrote in his books Physics of the Future that the failure of the Soviet coup of 1991 was due largely to the existence of technology such as the fax machine and computers that exposed classified information.\n\nThe Revolutions of 2011 were enabled by social networking and smartphone technology; however these revolutions in hindsight largely failed to reach their goals as hardcore Islamist governments and in Syria a civil war have formed in the absence of the dictatorships that were toppled.\n\nThe economic impact of the digital revolution has been large. Without the World Wide Web (WWW), for example, globalization and outsourcing would not be nearly as feasible as they are today. The digital revolution radically changed the way individuals and companies interact. Small regional companies were suddenly given access to much larger markets. Concepts such as On-demand services and manufacturing and rapidly dropping technology costs made possible innovations in all aspects of industry and everyday life.\n\nAfter initial concerns of an IT productivity paradox, evidence is mounting that digital technologies have significantly increased the productivity and performance of businesses.\n\nNegative effects include information overload, Internet predators, forms of social isolation, and media saturation. In a poll of prominent members of the national news media, 65 percent said the Internet is hurting journalism more than it is helping by allowing anyone no matter how amateur and unskilled to become a journalist; causing information to be muddier and the rise of conspiracy theory in a way it didn't exist in the past.\n\nIn some cases, company employees' pervasive use of portable digital devices and work related computers for personal use—email, instant messaging, computer games—were often found to, or perceived to, reduce those companies' productivity. Personal computing and other non-work related digital activities in the workplace thus helped lead to stronger forms of privacy invasion, such as keystroke recording and information filtering applications (spyware and content-control software).\n\nPrivacy in general became a concern during the digital revolution. The ability to store and utilize such large amounts of diverse information opened possibilities for tracking of individual activities and interests. Libertarians and privacy rights advocates feared the possibility of an Orwellian future where centralized power structures control the populace via automatic surveillance and monitoring of personal information in such programs as the CIA's Information Awareness Office. Consumer and labor advocates opposed the ability to direct market to individuals, discriminate in hiring and lending decisions, invasively monitor employee behavior and communications and generally profit from involuntarily shared personal information.\n\nThe Internet, especially the WWW in the 1990s, opened whole new avenues for communication and information sharing. The ability to easily and rapidly share information on a global scale brought with it a whole new level of freedom of speech. Individuals and organizations were suddenly given the ability to publish on any topic, to a global audience, at a negligible cost, particularly in comparison to any previous communication technology.\n\nLarge cooperative projects could be endeavored (e.g. Open-source software projects, SETI@home). Communities of like-minded individuals were formed (e.g. MySpace, Tribe.net). Small regional companies were suddenly given access to a larger marketplace.\n\nIn other cases, special interest groups as well as social and religious institutions found much of the content objectionable, even dangerous. Many parents and religious organizations, especially in the United States, became alarmed by pornography being more readily available to minors. In other circumstances the proliferation of information on such topics as child pornography, building bombs, committing acts of terrorism, and other violent activities were alarming to many different groups of people. Such concerns contributed to arguments for censorship and regulation on the WWW.\n\nCopyright and trademark issues also found new life in the digital revolution. The widespread ability of consumers to produce and distribute exact reproductions of protected works dramatically changed the intellectual property landscape, especially in the music, film, and television industries.\n\nThe digital revolution, especially regarding privacy, copyright, censorship and information sharing, remains a controversial topic. As the digital revolution progresses it remains unclear to what extent society has been impacted and will be altered in the future.\n\nWhile there have been huge benefits to society from the digital revolution, especially in terms of the accessibility of information, there are a number of concerns. Expanded powers of communication and information sharing, increased capabilities for existing technologies, and the advent of new technology brought with it many potential opportunities for exploitation. The digital revolution helped usher in a new age of mass surveillance, generating a range of new civil and human rights issues. Reliability of data became an issue as information could easily be replicated, but not easily verified. The digital revolution made it possible to store and track facts, articles, statistics, as well as minutiae hitherto unfeasible.\n\nFrom the perspective of the historian, a large part of human history is known through physical objects from the past that have been found or preserved, particularly in written documents. Digital records are easy to create but also easy to delete and modify. Changes in storage formats can make recovery of data difficult or near impossible, as can the storage of information on obsolete media for which reproduction equipment is unavailable, and even identifying what such data is and whether it is of interest can be near impossible if it is no longer easily readable, or if there is a large number of such files to identify. Information passed off as authentic research or study must be scrutinized and verified.\n\nThese problems are further compounded by the use of digital rights management and other copy prevention technologies which, being designed to only allow the data to be read on specific machines, may well make future data recovery impossible. The Voyager Golden Record, which is intended to be read by an intelligent extraterrestrial (perhaps a suitable parallel to a human from the distant future), is recorded in analog rather than digital format specifically for easy interpretation and analysis.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "881273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=881273", "title": "Esperanto etymology", "text": "Esperanto etymology\n\nEsperanto etymology, including vocabulary and grammatical forms, derives primarily from the Romance languages, with lesser contributions from Germanic. The language occupies a middle ground between \"naturalistic\" constructed languages such as Interlingua, which borrow words \"en masse\" from their source languages with little internal derivation, and \"a priori\" conlangs such as Solresol, in which the words have no historical connection to other languages. In Esperanto, root words are borrowed and retain much of the form of their source language, whether the phonetic form \"(eks-\" from international \"ex-,\" \"vualo\" from French \"voile)\" or orthographic form \"(teamo\" and \"boato\" from English \"team\" and \"boat,\" \"soifo\" from French \"soif).\" However, each root can then form dozens of derivations which may bear little resemblance to equivalent words in the source languages, such as \"registaro\" (government), which is derived from the Latinate root \"reg\" (to rule) but has a morphology closer to German or Russian.\n\nZamenhof took most of his Esperanto root words from languages of the Italic and Germanic families, principally Italian, French, German, Yiddish, and English. A large number are what might be called common European international vocabulary, or generic Romance: Roots common to several languages, such as \"vir-\" \"man\", found in English words such as \"virile,\" and \"okul-\" \"eye\", found in \"oculist.\" Some appear to be compromises between the primary languages, such as \"tondri\" (to thunder), per French \"tonner,\" Italian \"tuonare,\" German \"donnern,\" and English \"thunder.\"\n\nThe main languages contributing to Zamenhof's original vocabulary were \nFrench, English,\nand German, the modern languages most widely learned in schools around the world at the time Esperanto was devised. The result was that about two-thirds of this original vocabulary is Romance, and about one-third Germanic, including a pair of roots from Swedish:\nA couple of words, \"strato\" (street) and \"gisto\" (yeast), are closer to Dutch \"(straat, gist)\" than German \"(Straße \"[ŝtrasə], \"Gest),\" but this may be a compromise between German and English the way \"ŝtono\" (stone) is a compromise between German \"Stein\" [ŝtajn] and English. \"Fajro\" (fire) matches the pronunciation of English \"fire,\" but is also spelled and pronounced as Yiddish פֿײַר \"fajr\". Indeed, much of the supposedly German vocabulary actually appears to be Yiddish, specifically Zamenhof's native Bialystok (Northeastern) dialect, which had formed the basis of his abortive attempt to standardize that language. Words with the digraph \"ei\" in German may in Esperanto have either \"ej\" (corresponding to the spelling) or \"aj\" (corresponding to the pronunciation). This pattern is not random, but reflects \"ei\" and \"ī\" in Old High German, a distinction preserved in Yiddish: \"hejmo\" 'home' (German \"Heim\", Yiddish הײם \"hejm\"), \"fajfi\" 'whistle' (German \"pfeifen\", Yiddish פֿײַפֿן \"fajfn\"). Zamenhof never admitted to a Yiddish influence in Esperanto, presumably to avoid arousing antisemitic prejudice.\n\nMany of the Latinate roots were given an Italianesque appearance, corresponding to the use of Italian as a model for Esperanto pronunciation, but in form are closer to French, such as \"ĉemizo\" 'shirt' (French \"chemise\" [ŝəmiz], Italian \"camicia\" [kamiĉa]) and \"ĉevalo\" 'horse' (French \"cheval\" , Italian \"cavallo\").\nA couple of apparently Spanish or Portuguese roots, \"ronki\" (to snore) and \"iri\" (to go), may have come directly from Latin. Since Zamenhof's day, a large amount of Latinate vocabulary has been added to the language. In 1987, Mattos calculated that 84% of basic vocabulary was Latinate, 14% Germanic, and 2% Slavic and Greek.\n\nOnly a few roots were taken directly from the classical languages:\n\nAs in the examples of \"ardeo\" 'heron' and \"abio\" 'fir', the names of most plants and animals are based on their binomial nomenclature, and so many are Latin or Greek as well.\n\nSurprisingly few roots appear to have come from other modern European languages, even those Zamenhof was most familiar with. What follows is a fairly comprehensive list of such roots that do not also occur in principal languages:\n\nHowever, although few roots come directly from these languages, Russian exerted a considerable substratum influence on the semantics of Esperanto. An oft-cited example is \"plena\" \"full, complete\", which is Latinate in form (French \"plein(e),\" Latin \"plen-\" \"full\"), but has the semantic range of Russian \"полный polnyi\" \"full, complete\", as can be seen in the phrase \"plena vortaro\" \"a complete dictionary\", a usage not possible with the French or Latin words.\n\nOther languages were only represented in the original vocabulary in so far as they were cognate with, or as their words had become widespread in, Esperanto's source languages. However, since that time many languages have contributed words for specialized or regional concepts, such as \"haŝio\" (chopsticks) from Japanese and \"boaco\" (reindeer) from Saami.\n\nA few roots are obscure:\n\n\"Ĝi\" may possibly derive from the Lithuanian \"ji\" (she, it) and \"jis\" (he, it), and \"-ujo\" from the French \"étui\" (case).\n\nLike another indirect German borrowing, \"fraŭlo\" (bachelor), which derives from \"fraŭlino\" (Miss, from \"fräulein\") less the feminine suffix \"-in-\", \"edzo\" appears to be a back-formation of \"edzino\" (wife). Zamenhof said the latter derives from \"kronprincedzino\" (crown princess), borrowed from the German \"Kronprinzessin,\" and then internally analyzed as \"kron-\" (crown) \"princ-\" (prince) \"edzino\" (wife). However, Vilborg's \"Etimologia Vortaro\" argues that \"edzino\" is more likely to have come from Yiddish רביצין \"rebbetzin\" (rabbi's wife, Mrs.), reanalysed as \"rebb-etzin,\" and that Zamenhof made up the German etymology after the fact to avoid anti-Semitic prejudice against Esperanto. That would mean that \"edz-\" ultimately derives from the Slavic feminine suffix \"-its(a).\" Regardless, few words have histories this convoluted.\n\nThe correlatives, although clearly cognate with European languages (for example, \"kiel, tiel\" with French \"quel\" (which), \"tel\" (such); \"ĉiu\" with Italian \"ciascun\" (each), and \"-es\" with the German genitive \"-es,\" etc.), have been analogically leveled to the point that they are often given as examples of Esperanto innovations. This is especially true for the indefinite forms like \"io\" (something), which were devised by iconically removing the consonant of the \"ki-\" and \"ti-\" forms. Likewise, the restriction of the Italian and Greek masculine noun and adjective ending \"-o\" to nouns, and the feminine noun and adjective ending \"-a\" to adjectives and the article \"la,\" is an Esperanto innovation using existing forms.\n\nSome smaller words have been modified to the extent that they're difficult to recognize. For example, Italian \"a, ad\" (to) became \"al\" (to) under the influence of the contraction \"al\" (to the), to better fit the phonotactics of the language, and in a parallel change, Latin \"ex\" (out of) and Slavic \"od\" (by, than) may have become \"el\" (out of) and \"ol\" (than), though the latter also has the German parallel \"als\".\n\nThe Greek origin of the nominal inflections can be seen in the Greek \"a\"-declension nouns such as the word for \"muse\": \"musa,\" plural \"musai,\" accusative \"musan,\" which in Esperanto is \"muzo, muzoj, muzon.\" Greek \"o\"-declension words such as \"logos, logoi, logon (word) are similar, as are adjectival declensions such as \"aksia, aksiai, aksian (worthy). Greek was perhaps also the model of stressed \"i\" in Esperanto words like \"familío\" (family), which follows the common Greek pattern of \"aksía\" (worthy) and \"oikíai\" (houses).\n\nEsperanto has \"a/i/o\" ablaut for present/past/future tense, which has partial parallels in Latin present \"amat,\" perfect \"amavit,\" and the corresponding infinitives \"amare, amavisse.\" Otto Jespersen said of the ablaut,\n\nThere may have been a Volapük influence as well, or the two languages may have shared a common influence from earlier languages. In Volapük, the vowels are present \"a-\", future \"o-\", past perfect \"i-\", as well as imperfect \"ä-\" ; Esperanto retained a distinction between preterite \"-is\" and imperfect \"-es\" until 1887, the year the modern form of the language was published.\n\nJespersen didn't parse all of the morphology. The ablaut for the five languages is as follows:\n\nThe infinitive suffix \"-i\" may derive from Latin deponent verbs, such as \"loqui\" (to speak). With elements like these that are only one or two letters long, it is difficult to know whether resemblances are due to the forms being related, or just coincidence. For example, it is speculated that the jussive \"-u\" is from the Hebrew imperative \"-û,\" but it could also be from the Greek [u] imperative of deponent verbs such as \"dekhou\" (receive!); or perhaps it was inspired by [u] being found in both Hebrew and Greek. Similarly, adverbial \"-e\" is found in Latin and Italian \"(bene)\" as well as in Russian (after a palatalized consonant); the participle bases \"-t-\" and \"-nt-\" are found in Latin, Italian, Greek, and German; and the pronominal base \"-i\" is found in Italian (\"-mi, -ti, -vi, -si, -gli\" for Esperanto \"mi, ci, vi, si, li\") and English (\"me, we, he, she\").\n\nModern international vocabulary, much of it Latin or Greek in origin, is of course used as well, but frequently for a family of related words only the root will be borrowed directly, and the rest will be derived from it using Esperanto means of word formation. For example, the computer term 'bit' was borrowed directly as \"bito\", but 'byte' was then derived by compounding \"bito\" with the numeral \"ok\" (eight), for the uniquely Esperanto word \"bitoko\" ('an octet of bits'). Although not a familiar form to speakers of European languages, the transparency of its formation is helpful to those who do not have this advantage. Moreover, even \"bito\" has the synonym \"duumo\", based on \"du\" (two) and \"-um-\" (the affix with undefined meaning).\n\nWith the exception of perhaps a hundred common or generic plant and animal names, Esperanto adopts the international binomial nomenclature of living organisms, using suitable orthography, and changing the nominal and adjectival grammatical endings to \"-o\" and \"-a\". For example, the binomial for the guineafowl is \"Numida meleagris\". In Esperanto, therefore, a \"numido\" would be any bird of the genus \"Numida\", and a \"meleagra numido\" the helmeted guineafowl specifically. Likewise, a \"numidedo\" is any bird in the guineafowl family Numididæ.\n\nThere is some question over which inflection to use when assimilating Latin and Greek words. Zamenhof generally preferred the oblique stem over the nominative singular form, as in \"reĝo\" (king), which follows the Latin oblique forms with \"reg–\" (compare English \"regicide\"), or \"floro\" (flower) as in \"floral,\" rather than nominative singular \"rex\" and \"flos.\" However, European national standards differ in this regard, resulting in debate over the form of later \"international\" borrowings, such as whether the asteroid Pallas should be \"Palaso\" in Esperanto, parallel to French and English names \"Pallas,\" or \"Palado,\" as in Italian \"Pallade,\" Russian \"Паллада\" (\"Palláda\"), and the English adjective \"Palladian.\" In some cases there are three possibilities, as can be seen in the English noun \"helix\" (\"x\" = [ks]), its plural \"helices\" (\"c\" = [s]), and its adjective \"helical\" (\"c\" = [k]). Although the resulting potential for conflict is frequently criticized, it does present an opportunity to disambiguate what would otherwise be homonyms based on culturally specific and often fossilized metaphors. For example, all three of the forms of Latin \"helix\" are found as Esperanto roots, one with the original meaning, and the other two representing old metaphors: \"helico\" (a spiral), \"heliko\" (a snail), \"helikso\" (the incurved rim of the ear).\n\nNormally the Latin or Greek inflectional ending is replaced with the Esperanto inflectional ending \"−o.\" However, the original inflection will occasionally be retained, as if it were part of the root, in order to disambiguate from a more common word. For example, a virus (from Latin \"vir-us)\" is \"virus-o\" instead of the expected \"*vir-o\" in order to avoid confusion with \"vir-o\" (a man), and the Latin root \"corp-us\" is the source of both \"korp-o\" (a living body) and \"korpus-o\" (a military corps). Similarly, when the sound \"ĥ\" is replaced with \"k,\" as it commonly is (see Esperanto phonology), the word \"ĥoro\" (a chorus) is replaced with \"koruso\" to avoid creating a homonym with \"koro\" (a heart). The redundant inflection may have been inspired by Lithuanian, which otherwise contributed relatively little to Esperanto: compare \"fokuso\" (focus), \"kokoso\" (coconut), \"lotuso\" (lotus), \"patoso\" (pathos), \"radiuso\" (radius), \"sinuso\" (sine), and \"viruso\" (virus), with Lithuanian \"fokusas, kokosas, lotosas, patosas, radiusas, sinusas,\" and \"virusas\" (virus) vs. \"vyras\" (man).\n\nProto-Esperanto had voicing ablaut, traces of which remain in a few pairs of words such as \"pezi\" 'to weigh' (to have weight) and \"pesi\" 'to weigh' (to measure the weight). Because little of Proto-Esperanto has survived, it is not clear which other aspects of Esperanto etymology might date to this period.\n\n\nNote: This dictionary should be used with caution. For example, \"amelo\" (starch) is given as a rare example of a Greek word that does not occur in Latin. However, it is not only a Latin derivation (from \"amyl-um),\" but more directly derives from German \"amel-.\"\n"}

{"id": "1682176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1682176", "title": "Funerary hatchment", "text": "Funerary hatchment\n\nA funerary hatchment is a depiction within a black lozenge-shaped frame, generally on a black (\"sable\") background, of a deceased's heraldic achievement, that is to say the escutcheon showing the arms, together with the crest and supporters of his family or person. Regimental Colours and other military or naval emblems are sometimes placed behind the arms of military or naval officers. Such funerary hatchments, generally therefore restricted in use to members of the nobility or armigerous gentry, used to be hung on the wall of a deceased person's house, and were later transferred to the parish church, often within the family chapel therein which appertained to the manor house, the family occupying which, generally being lord of the manor, generally held the advowson of the church. In Germany, the approximate equivalent is a , literally \"death shield\".\n\n\"Hatchment\" is a corruption (through such historic forms as \"atcheament, achement, hathement\", etc.) of the French \"achevèment\", from the verb \"achever\", a contraction of \"a chef venir\" (\"to come to a head\"), ultimately from Latin \"ad caput venire\", \"to come to a head\", thus to reach a conclusion, accomplish, achieve. The word in its historical usage is thus identical in meaning and origin to the English heraldic term achievement. However in recent years the word \"hatchment\" has come to be used almost exclusively to denote \"funerary hatchment\", whilst \"achievement\" is now used in place of \"hatchment\" in a non-funereal context. An example of the historic use of \"hatchment\" in a non-funerary context is in the statute of the Order of the Garter laid down by King Henry VIII (1509-1547) concerning the regulation of Garter stall plates:\n\"It is agreed that every knyght within the yere of his stallation shall cause to be made a scauchon of his armes and hachementis in a plate of metall suche as shall please him and that it shall be surely sett upon the back of his stall\".\nThe word appears in Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\" (1599/1602): Laertes laments that his dead father Polonius has \"No trophy, sword or hatchment o'er his bones\" (Act IV, Scene 5).\n\nThe funerary hatchment was usually placed over the entrance door of the deceased's residence at the level of the second floor, and remained \"in situ\" for six to twelve months, after which it was removed to the parish church. The practice developed in the early 17th century from the custom of carrying an heraldic shield before the coffin of the deceased, then leaving it for display in the church. Funerary hatchments also survive displayed in homes or local museums. In medieval times and later, helmets and shields were sometimes deposited in churches, and helmets (made for the purpose) survive for example in the churches of Iron Acton in Gloucestershire and King's Nympton in Devon.\n\nAt the universities of Oxford and Cambridge it was usual to hang the funerary hatchment of a deceased head of house over the entrance to his lodge or residence.\n\nIn the 21st century the display of funerary hatchments has largely been discontinued, except in the case of royalty and occasionally by the higher nobility, but many ancient funerary hatchments survive displayed in parish churches throughout England.\n\nFor a bachelor the hatchment bears his heraldic achievement (shield, crest, supporters and other appendages) on a black lozenge. For a spinster, her arms are represented upon a lozenge, bordered with knotted ribbons, also on a black lozenge. In the case of a married man with a surviving wife, within his funerary hatchment is an escutcheon displaying his arms impale the paternal arms of his wife. If she should be an heraldic heiress her paternal arms are placed upon an inescutcheon of pretence, and crest and other appendages are added. The dexter half of the background is black (the husband being dead), whilst the sinister half of the background is white (his wife still being alive).\n\nFor a deceased woman whose husband is alive the same arrangement is used, but the sinister background is black (for the wife) and the dexter background is white (for the surviving husband). For a widower the same is used as for a married man, but the whole ground is black (both spouses being dead). For a widow the husband's arms are given with her own, but upon a lozenge in place of an escutcheon, with ribbons, without crest or appendages, with the whole of the ground black. When there have been two wives or two husbands the ground may be divided in a number of different ways. Sometimes the shield is divided into three parts \"per pale\" (vertical divisions), with the husband's arms in the middle section and the arms of each of his wives to each side of his. Sometimes the husband's arms remain in the dexter half and the two wives have their arms in the sinister half, divided \"per fess\" (horizontal divisions), each wife having one quarter of the whole shield, that is one half of the sinister half.\n\nIn Scottish funerary hatchments it was not unusual to place the arms of the father and mother of the deceased in the two lateral angles of the lozenge, and sometimes there are 4, 8 or 16 genealogical escutcheons ranged along the margin.\n\nIn the Netherlands hatchments (in Dutch, \"rouwbord\", literally meaning \"mourning shield\") with the word \"OBIIT\" (Latin:\"deceased\") and the date of death were hung over the door of the deceased's house and later on the wall of the church where he was buried. In the 17th century the hatchments were sober black lozenge-shaped frames with the coat of arms. In the 18th century both the frames and the heraldry got more and more elaborate. Symbols of death like batwings, skulls, hour-glasses and crying angels with torches were added and the names of the 8, 16 or even 32 armigerous forebearers (sometimes an invention, there were a lot of \"nouveaux riches\") and their genealogical escutcheons were displayed. The British tradition of differentiating between the hatchments of bachelors, widowers and others is unknown in the Low Countries. The arms of a widow are sometimes surrounded by a cordelière (knotted cord) and the arms of women are often, but not always, shaped like a lozenge. There were no Kings of Arms to rule and regulate these traditions.\n\nIn 1795 the Dutch republic, recently conquered by revolutionary France, issued a decree that banned all heraldic shields. Thousands of hatchments were chopped to pieces and burned. In the 19th century the hatchments were almost forgotten and only a few noble families kept the tradition alive.\n\nIn Flanders, the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church have kept the tradition of putting up hatchments alive to this day. Noble families have continued to put up hatchments in churches.\n\nUnlike the British hatchments the Dutch and Belgian examples are often inscribed with dates of birth and death, often the Latin words \"obit\", \"nascent\" and \"svea\" are used to give the dates of death and birth and the age of the deceased. The name and titles are sometimes added along with the arms of various ancestors.\n\nSometimes the coats of arms of man and woman are shown on a hatchment.\n\nOnly about fifty hatchments still exist in Scotland, unlike the many to be found in England and the Netherlands, where there may well be more Scots hatchments surviving than in Scotland. Part of this is undoubtedly due to the Church of Scotland in the mid 17th century. In 1643 the General Assembly passed an Act in 1643 which prohibited 'Honours of Arms or any such like monuments' to be displayed in any church. A surviving document of Strathbogie in Aberdeenshire records that: \"Att Grange, 19th December, 1649... the presbytry finding some pinselis in memorie of the dead hinging in the kirk, presentlie caused them to be pulled doun in face of presbytry, and the minister rebuiked for suffering to hing ther so long.\"\n\nScots hatchments do not follow in the sparse pattern that modern writers prescribe for hatchments and funeral heraldry, being sometimes quite highly decorated with the coats of antecedents and with tears, skulls (mort heads) and mantles.\n\nHatchments, and funeral heraldry in general, are discussed in a 1986 article by Charles J Burnett, Dingwall Pursuivant.\n\nThere are eight hatchments in Nova Scotia, Canada, which are located in St. Paul's Church (Halifax). They include:\nTwenty-nine 18th- and early 19th-century Dutch-style rouwborden are known to survive in the province of the Western Cape, which was a Dutch colony from 1652 to 1806. Twenty-five are in the Groote Kerk in Cape Town, one is in the Western Cape Archives, and the other three are in museums.\n\nDuring the period of Dutch rule, the display of rouwborden was evidently restricted to senior officials and military officers, and a few high-ranking foreign dignitaries who died at the Cape. When the main part of the church building was demolished in 1836, because it had become structurally unsound, the rouwborden were stored in the tower. They were left there after the rebuilt church was completed in 1841, and reportedly deteriorated with the passage of time. Some forty years later, the newly-established Colonial Archives rescued twenty-five of them, and they were displayed in the Archives until the church reclaimed them in 1910. They were then hung in the vestry, and it was not until the 1960s that they were hung in the church itself.\n\n\n"}

The town, which is in the Mendip district, had a population of 8,932 in the 2011 census. Glastonbury is less than across the River Brue from Street, which is now larger than Glastonbury.\n\nEvidence from timber trackways such as the Sweet Track show that the town has been inhabited since Neolithic times. Glastonbury Lake Village was an Iron Age village, close to the old course of the River Brue and Sharpham Park approximately west of Glastonbury, that dates back to the Bronze Age. Centwine was the first Saxon patron of Glastonbury Abbey, which dominated the town for the next 700 years. One of the most important abbeys in England, it was the site of Edmund Ironside's coronation as King of England in 1016. Many of the oldest surviving buildings in the town, including the Tribunal, George Hotel and Pilgrims' Inn and the Somerset Rural Life Museum, which is based in an old tithe barn, are associated with the abbey. The Church of St John the Baptist dates from the 15th century.\n\nThe town became a centre for commerce, which led to the construction of the market cross, Glastonbury Canal and the Glastonbury and Street railway station, the largest station on the original Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The Brue Valley Living Landscape is a conservation project managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust and nearby is the Ham Wall National Nature Reserve.\n\nGlastonbury has been described as a New Age community which attracts people with New Age and Neopagan beliefs, and is notable for myths and legends often related to Glastonbury Tor, concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury and stuck his staff into the ground, when it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn. The presence of a landscape zodiac around the town has been suggested but no evidence has been discovered. The Glastonbury Festival, held in the nearby village of Pilton, takes its name from the town.\n\nDuring the 7th millennium BC the sea level rose and flooded the valleys and low-lying ground surrounding Glastonbury so the Mesolithic people occupied seasonal camps on the higher ground, indicated by scatters of flints. The Neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways. These included the Sweet Track, west of Glastonbury, which is one of the oldest engineered roads known and was the oldest timber trackway discovered in Northern Europe, until the 2009 discovery of a 6,000-year-old trackway in Belmarsh Prison. Tree-ring dating (dendrochronology) of the timbers has enabled very precise dating of the track, showing it was built in 3807 or 3806 BC. It has been claimed to be the oldest road in the world. The track was discovered in the course of peat digging in 1970, and is named after its discoverer, Ray Sweet. It extended across the marsh between what was then an island at Westhay, and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, a distance close to . The track is one of a network of tracks that once crossed the Somerset Levels. Built in the 39th century BC, during the Neolithic period, the track consisted of crossed poles of ash, oak and lime (\"Tilia\") which were driven into the waterlogged soil to support a walkway that mainly consisted of oak planks laid end-to-end. Since the discovery of the Sweet Track, it has been determined that it was built along the route of an even earlier track, the \"Post Track\", dating from 3838 BC and so 30 years older.\nGlastonbury Lake Village was an Iron Age village, close to the old course of the River Brue, on the Somerset Levels near Godney, some north west of Glastonbury. It covers an area of north to south by east to west, and housed around 100 people in five to seven groups of houses, each for an extended family, with sheds and barns, made of hazel and willow covered with reeds, and surrounded either permanently or at certain times by a wooden palisade. The village was built in about 300 BC and occupied into the early Roman period (around 100 AD) when it was abandoned, possibly due to a rise in the water level. It was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble and clay.\n\nSharpham Park is a historic park, west of Glastonbury, which dates back to the Bronze Age.\n\nThe origin of the name Glastonbury is unclear but when the settlement is first recorded in the 7th and the early 8th century, it was called \"Glestingaburg\". The \"burg\" element is Anglo-Saxon and could refer either to a fortified place such as a burh or, more likely, a monastic enclosure; however the \"Glestinga\" element is obscure, and may derive from an Old English word or from a Saxon or Celtic personal name. It may derive from a person or kindred group named Glast.\nThe name however is likely related to an Irish individual named Glas mac Caise 'Glas son of Cas'. Glas is an ancient Irish personal name meaning 'green, grey/green'. It is stated in the Life of St Patrick that he resurrected a swineherder by that name and he went to Glastonbury, to an area of the village known as Glastonbury of the Irish. This was known to the Irish as Glastimbir na n-Gaoidhil 'Glastonbury of the Gaels'. (The Archaeology and History of Glastonbury Abbey - Courteney Arthur Ralegh Radford). This is the earliest source for the name Glastonbury. The modern Irish form for Glastonbury is Glaistimbir.\n\nHugh Ross Williamson cites a tale about St. Collen, one of the earliest hermits to inhabit the Tor before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to the summit of the Tor. Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on a throne of gold; holy water disperses the apparition. This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is \"made of glass\" so as to receive the spirits of the dead, which were supposed to depart from the summit of the Tor. This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the Tor was named after the glassy mansion of the dead.\n\nWilliam of Malmesbury in his \"De Antiquitate Glastonie Ecclesie\" gives the Old Celtic \"Ineswitrin\" (or \"Ynys Witrin\") as its earliest name, and asserts that the founder of the town was the eponymous Glast, a descendant of Cunedda.\n\nCentwine (676–685) was the first Saxon patron of Glastonbury Abbey. King Edmund Ironside was buried at the abbey. The Domesday Book indicates that in the hundred of \"Glastingberiensis\", the Abbey was the Lord in 1066 prior to the arrival of William the Conqueror then tenant-in chief with Godwin as Lord of \"Glastingberi\" in 1086.\n\nTo the southwest of the town centre is Beckery, which was once a village in its own right but is now part of the suburbs. Around the 7th and 8th centuries it was occupied by a small monastic community associated with a cemetery. Archaeological excavations in 2016 uncovered 50 to 60 skeletons thought to be those of monks from Beckery Chapel during the 5th or early 6th century.\n\nSharpham Park was granted by King Eadwig to the then abbot Æthelwold in 957. In 1191 Sharpham Park was gifted by the soon-to-be King John I to the Abbots of Glastonbury, who remained in possession of the park and house until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. From 1539 to 1707 the park was owned by the Duke of Somerset, Sir Edward Seymour, brother of Queen Jane; the Thynne family of Longleat, and the family of Sir Henry Gould. Edward Dyer was born here in 1543. The house is now a private residence and Grade II* listed building. It was the birthplace of Sir Edward Dyer (died 1607) an Elizabethan poet and courtier, the writer Henry Fielding (1707–54), and the cleric William Gould.\n\nIn the 1070s St Margaret's Chapel was built on Magdelene Street, originally as a hospital and later as almshouses for the poor. The building dates from 1444. The roof of the hall is thought to have been removed after the Dissolution, and some of the building was demolished in the 1960s. It is Grade II* listed, and a Scheduled ancient monument. Hospital of St Mary Magdalene, Glastonbury In 2010 plans were announced to restore the building.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the town largely depended on the abbey but was also a centre for the wool trade until the 18th century. A Saxon-era canal connected the abbey to the River Brue. Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury, was executed with two of his monks on 15 November 1539 during the dissolution of the monasteries.\n\nDuring the Second Cornish Uprising of 1497 Perkin Warbeck surrendered when he heard that Giles, Lord Daubeney's troops, loyal to Henry VII were camped at Glastonbury.\n\nIn 1693 Glastenbury, Connecticut was founded and named after the English town from which some of the settlers had emigrated. It is rumored to have originally been called \"Glistening Town\" until the mid-19th century, when the name was changed to match the spelling of Glastonbury, England, but in fact, residents of the Connecticut town believe this to be a myth, based on the Glastonbury Historical Society's records. A representation of the Glastonbury thorn is incorporated onto the town seal.\n\nThe Somerset town's charter of incorporation was received in 1705. Growth in the trade and economy largely depended on the drainage of the surrounding moors. The opening of the Glastonbury Canal produced an upturn in trade, and encouraged local building. The parish was part of the hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides, until the 1730s when it became a borough in its own right.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century the Glastonbury Canal drainage problems and competition from the new railways caused a decline in trade, and the town's economy became depressed. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854. The lower sections of the canal were given to the Commissioners for Sewers, for use as a drainage ditch. The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and was filled in. The Central Somerset Railway merged with the Dorset Central Railway to become the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The main line to Glastonbury closed in 1966.\n\nIn the Northover district industrial production of sheepskins, woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, developed in conjunction with the growth of C&J Clark in Street. Clarks still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries tourism developed based on the rise of antiquarianism, the association with the abbey and mysticism of the town. This was aided by accessibility via the rail and road network, which has continued to support the town's economy and led to a steady rise in resident population since 1801.\n\nGlastonbury received national media coverage in 1999 when cannabis plants were found in the town's floral displays.\n\nGlastonbury is notable for myths and legends concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur as recorded by ancient historians William of Malmesbury, Venerable Bede, Gerald of Wales and Geoffrey of Monmouth. Many long-standing and cherished legends were examined in a four-year study by archaeologists, led by Professor Roberta Gilchrist, at the University of Reading, who, amongst other findings, speculated that the connection with King Arthur and his Queen, Guinivere, was created deliberately by the monks in 1184 to meet a financial crisis caused by a devastating fire. Other myths examined include the visit by Jesus, the building of the oldest church in England, and the flowering of the walking stick. Roberta Gilchrist stated, \"We didn’t claim to disprove the legendary associations, nor would we wish to\". The site of King Arthur's supposed grave contained material dating from between the 11th and 15th Centuries. Gilchrist said, \"That doesn't dispel the Arthurian legend, it just means the pit [20th Century archaeologist Ralegh Radford] excavated he rather over-claimed.\" The study made new archaeological finds; its leader found Glastonbury to be a remarkable archaeological site. The new results were reported on the Glastonbury Abbey Web site, and were to be incorporated into the Abbey's guidebook; however, the leader of the study, who became a trustee of Glastonbury, said \"We are not in the business of destroying people’s beliefs ... A thousand years of beliefs and legends are part of the intangible history of this remarkable place\". Gilchrist went on to say, “archaeology can help us to understand how legends evolve and what people in the past believed.” She noted that the project has actually uncovered the first definitive proof of occupation at the Glastonbury Abbey site during the fifth century—when Arthur allegedly lived.\n\nThe legend that Joseph of Arimathea retrieved certain holy relics was introduced by the French poet Robert de Boron in his 13th-century version of the grail story, thought to have been a trilogy though only fragments of the later books survive today. The work became the inspiration for the later Vulgate Cycle of Arthurian tales.\n\nDe Boron's account relates how Joseph captured Jesus' blood in a cup (the \"Holy Grail\") which was subsequently brought to Britain. The Vulgate Cycle reworked Boron's original tale. Joseph of Arimathea was no longer the chief character in the Grail origin: Joseph's son, Josephus, took over his role of the Grail keeper.\nThe earliest versions of the grail romance, however, do not call the grail \"holy\" or mention anything about blood, Joseph or Glastonbury.\n\nIn 1191, monks at the abbey claimed to have found the graves of Arthur and Guinevere to the south of the Lady Chapel of the Abbey Church, which was visited by a number of contemporary historians including Giraldus Cambrensis. The remains were later moved and were lost during the Reformation. Many scholars suspect that this discovery was a pious forgery to substantiate the antiquity of Glastonbury's foundation, and increase its renown.\n\nAn early Welsh poem links Arthur to the Tor in an account of a confrontation between Arthur and Melwas, who had kidnapped Queen Guinevere.\nJoseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On disembarking he stuck his staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (or Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of thorn is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.\n\nThe original Holy Thorn was a centre of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages but was chopped down during the English Civil War. A replacement thorn was planted in the 20th century on Wearyall hill (originally in 1951 to mark the Festival of Britain, but the thorn had to be replanted the following year as the first attempt did not take). The Wearyall Hill Holy Thorn was vandalised in 2010 and all its branches were chopped off. It initially showed signs of recovery but now (2014) appears to be dead. A new sapling has been planted nearby. Many other examples of the thorn grow throughout Glastonbury including those in the grounds of Glastonbury Abbey, St Johns Church and Chalice Well.\n\nToday Glastonbury Abbey presents itself as \"traditionally the oldest above-ground Christian church in the world,\" which according to the legend was built at Joseph's behest to house the Holy Grail, 65 or so years after the death of Jesus. The legend also says that as a child, Jesus had visited Glastonbury along with Joseph. The legend probably was encouraged during the medieval period when religious relics and pilgrimages were profitable business for abbeys. William Blake mentioned the legend in a poem that became a popular hymn, \"Jerusalem\" (see And did those feet in ancient time).\n\nIn 1934 artist Katherine Maltwood suggested a landscape zodiac, a map of the stars on a gigantic scale, formed by features in the landscape such as roads, streams and field boundaries, could be found situated around Glastonbury. She held that the \"temple\" was created by Sumerians about 2700 BC. The idea of a prehistoric landscape zodiac fell into disrepute when two independent studies examined the Glastonbury Zodiac, one by Ian Burrow in 1975 and the other by Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy in 1983. These both used standard methods of landscape historical research. Both studies concluded that the evidence contradicted the idea of an ancient zodiac. The eye of Capricorn identified by Maltwood was a haystack. The western wing of the Aquarius phoenix was a road laid in 1782 to run around Glastonbury, and older maps dating back to the 1620s show the road had no predecessors. The Cancer boat (not a crab as in conventional western astrology) consists of a network of 18th-century drainage ditches and paths. There are some Neolithic paths preserved in the peat of the bog formerly comprising most of the area, but none of the known paths match the lines of the zodiac features. There is no support for this theory, or for the existence of the \"temple\" in any form, from conventional archaeologists. Glastonbury is also said to be the centre of several ley lines.\n\nThe town council is made up of 16 members, and is based at the Town Hall, Magdalene Street. The town hall was built in 1818 and has a two-storey late Georgian ashlar front. It is a Grade II* listed building.\n\nGlastonbury is in the local government district of Mendip, which is part of the county of Somerset. It was previously administered by Glastonbury Municipal Borough. The Mendip district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, the library, road maintenance, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nThe town's retained fire station is operated by Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service. Police and ambulance services are provided by Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. There are two doctors' surgeries in Glastonbury, and a National Health Service community hospital operated by Somerset Primary Care Trust which opened in 2005.\n\nThere are 4 electoral wards within \"Glastonbury\" having in total the same population as is mentioned above.\n\nGlastonbury falls within the Wells constituency, represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. The Member of Parliament is Conservative, James Heappey, who replaced Tessa Munt of the Liberal Democrats in the 2015 General Election. It is within the South West England (European Parliament constituency), which elects six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nGlastonbury is twinned with the Greek island of Patmos, and Lalibela, Ethiopia.\n\nThe walk up the Tor to the distinctive tower at the summit (the partially restored remains of an old church) is rewarded by vistas of the mid-Somerset area, including the Levels which are drained marshland. From there, on a dry point, above sea level, it is easy to appreciate how Glastonbury was once an island and, in the winter, the surrounding moors are often flooded, giving that appearance once more. It is an agricultural region typically with open fields of permanent grass, surrounded by ditches with willow trees. Access to the moors and Levels is by \"droves\", i.e., green lanes. The Levels and inland moors can be below peak tides and have large areas of peat. The low-lying areas are underlain by much older Triassic age formations of Upper Lias sand that protrude to form what would once have been islands and include Glastonbury Tor. The lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000 years, following the end of the last ice age.\n\nThe low-lying damp ground can produce a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana. This optical phenomenon occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed. The Italian name \"Fata Morgana\" is derived from the name of Morgan le Fay, who was alternatively known as Morgane, Morgain, Morgana and other variants. Morgan le Fay was described as a powerful sorceress and antagonist of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere in the Arthurian legend.\n\nGlastonbury is less than across the River Brue from the village of Street. At the time of King Arthur the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. This lake is one of the locations suggested by Arthurian legend as the home of the Lady of the Lake. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it is suggested that it was here that Sir Bedivere threw Excalibur into the waters after King Arthur fell at the Battle of Camlann. The old bridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete arch bridge in 1911.\n\nUntil the 13th century, the direct route to the sea at Highbridge was prevented by gravel banks and peat near Westhay. The course of the river partially encircled Glastonbury from the south, around the western side (through Beckery), and then north through the Panborough-Bleadney gap in the Wedmore-Wookey Hills, to join the River Axe just north of Bleadney. This route made it difficult for the officials of Glastonbury Abbey to transport produce from their outlying estates to the abbey, and when the valley of the River Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Some time between 1230 and 1250 a new channel was constructed westwards into Meare Pool north of Meare, and further westwards to Mark Moor. The Brue Valley Living Landscape is a conservation project based on the Somerset Levels and Moors and managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust. The project commenced in January 2009 and aims to restore, recreate and reconnect habitat, ensuring that wildlife is enhanced and capable of sustaining itself in the face of climate change, while guaranteeing farmers and other landowners can continue to use their land profitably. It is one of an increasing number of landscape-scale conservation projects in the UK.\nThe Ham Wall National Nature Reserve, west of Glastonbury, is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. This new wetland habitat has been established from out peat diggings and now consists of areas of reedbed, wet scrub, open water and peripheral grassland and woodland. Bird species living on the site include the bearded tit and the bittern.\n\nThe Whitelake River rises between two low limestone ridges to the north of Glastonbury, part of the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. The confluence of the two small streams that make the Whitelake River is on Worthy Farm, the site of the Glastonbury Festival, between the small villages of Pilton and Pylle.\n\nAlong with the rest of South West England, Glastonbury has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.\n\nGlastonbury is a centre for religious tourism and pilgrimage. As with many towns of similar size, the centre is not as thriving as it once was but Glastonbury supports a large number of alternative shops.\n\nThe outskirts of the town contain a DIY shop a former sheepskin and slipper factory site, once owned by Morlands, which is slowly being redeveloped. The site of the old Morlands factory was scheduled for demolition and redevelopment into a new light industrial park, although there have been some protests that the buildings should be reused rather than being demolished. As part of the redevelopment of the site a project has been established by the Glastonbury Community Development Trust to provide support for local unemployed people applying for employment, starting in self-employment and accessing work-related training.\n\nAccording to the Glastonbury Conservation Area Appraisal of July 2010, there are approximately 170 listed buildings or structures in the town's designated conservation area, of which eight are listed grade I, six are listed grade II* and the remainder are listed grade II.\n\nThe Tribunal was a medieval merchant's house, used as the Abbey courthouse and, during the Monmouth Rebellion trials, by Judge Jeffreys. It now serves as a museum containing possessions and works of art from the Glastonbury Lake Village which were preserved in almost perfect condition in the peat after the village was abandoned. The museum is run by the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society. The building also houses the tourist information centre.\n\nThe octagonal Market Cross was built in 1846 by Benjamin Ferrey.\n\nThe George Hotel and Pilgrims' Inn was built in the late 15th century to accommodate visitors to Glastonbury Abbey, which is open to visitors. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The front of the 3-storey building is divided into 3 tiers of panels with traceried heads. Above the right of centre entrance are 3 carved panels with arms of the Abbey and Edward IV.\n\nThe Somerset Rural Life Museum is a museum of the social and agricultural history of Somerset, housed in buildings surrounding a 14th-century barn once belonging to Glastonbury Abbey. It was used for the storage of arable produce, particularly wheat and rye, from the abbey's home farm of approximately . Threshing and winnowing would also have been carried out in the barn, which was built from local \"shelly\" limestone with thick timbers supporting the stone tiling of the roof. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building, and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\nThe Chalice Well is a holy well at the foot of the Tor, covered by a wooden well-cover with wrought-iron decoration made in 1919. The natural spring has been in almost constant use for at least two thousand years. Water issues from the spring at a rate of per day and has never failed, even during drought. Iron oxide deposits give the water a reddish hue, as dissolved ferrous oxide becomes oxygenated at the surface and is precipitated, providing chalybeate waters. As with the hot springs in nearby Bath, the water is believed to possess healing qualities. The well is about deep, with two underground chambers at its bottom. It is often portrayed as a symbol of the female aspect of deity, with the male symbolised by Glastonbury Tor. As such, it is a popular destination for pilgrims in search of the divine feminine, including modern Pagans. The well is however popular with all faiths and in 2001 became a World Peace Garden.\n\nJust a short distance from the Chalice Well site, across a road known as Well House Lane, can be found the \"White Spring\", where a temple has been created in the 21st century. Whilst the waters of the Chalice Well are touched red with iron, the water of the latter is white with calcite. Both springs rise from caverns underneath the Tor and it is claimed that both have healing in their flow.\n\nThe building now used as the White Spring Temple was originally a Victorian-built well house, erected by the local water board in 1872. Around that time, an outbreak of cholera in the area caused great concern and the natural caves were dug out, and a stone collection chamber was constructed to ensure the flow of a quality water supply. Study of the flow of water into the collection chamber has shown that the builders also tapped into other springs, besides the White Spring and judging from the high iron content of one of these springs, it appears that a small offshoot of Chalice Well finds its way under Well House Lane to emerge beside the White Spring. However, after building the reservoir, the water board soon discovered that the high calciferous content of the water caused pipes to block and by the end of the 19th century water was piped into Glastonbury from out of town. After lying derelict for many years, the water board sold off the well house, which is now maintained by a group of volunteers as a \"water temple\". On the outside of the building is a tap where visitors and locals can collect the water of the White Spring.\n\nThe Glastonbury Canal ran just over through two locks from Glastonbury to Highbridge where it entered the Bristol Channel in the early 19th century, but it became uneconomic with the arrival of the railway in the 1840s.\n\nGlastonbury and Street railway station was the biggest station on the original Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway main line from Highbridge to Evercreech Junction until closed in 1966 under the Beeching axe. Opened in 1854 as Glastonbury, and renamed in 1886, it had three platforms, two for Evercreech to Highbridge services and one for the branch service to Wells. The station had a large goods yard controlled from a signal box. The site is now a timber yard for a local company. Replica level crossing gates have been placed at the entrance.\n\nThe nearest railway station is at Castle Cary but there is no direct bus route linking it to Glastonbury. There are convenient bus connections between Glastonbury and the railway stations at Bristol Temple Meads (over an hour travelling time) and at Taunton.\n\nThe main road in the town is the A39 which passes through Glastonbury from Wells connecting the town with Street and the M5 motorway. The other roads around the town are small and run across the levels generally following the drainage ditches. Local bus services are provided by WebberBus, Nippy Bus, National Express and local community groups. Glastonbury's bus services have suffered in cuts made from 2012 to 2014. The main routes are to Bristol via Wells, to Bridgwater, to Yeovil via Street and to Taunton.\n\nThere are several infant and primary schools in Glastonbury and the surrounding villages. Secondary education is provided by St Dunstan's School. In 2017, the school had 327 students between the ages of 11 and 16 years. It is named after St. Dunstan, an abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, who went on to become the Archbishop of Canterbury in 960 AD. The school was built in 1958 with major building work, at a cost of £1.2 million, in 1998, adding the science block and the sports hall. It was designated as a specialist Arts College in 2004, and the £800,000 spent at this time paid for the Performing Arts studio and facilities to support students with special educational needs.\n\nStrode College in Street provides academic and vocational courses for those aged 16–18 and adult education. A tertiary institution and further education college, most of the courses it offers are A-levels or Business and Technology Education Councils (BTECs). The college also provides some university-level courses, and is part of The University of Plymouth Colleges network.\n\nGlastonbury may have been a site of religious importance in pre-Christian times. The abbey was founded by Britons, and dates to at least the early 7th century, although later medieval Christian legend claimed that the abbey was founded by Joseph of Arimathea in the 1st century. This legend is intimately tied to Robert de Boron's version of the Holy Grail story and to Glastonbury's connection to King Arthur, which dates at least to the early 12th century. William of Malmesbury called this structure \"the oldest church in England,\" and, henceforth, it was known simply as the Old Church, it had existed, for many years prior to the 7th century as a Celitc religious center. In his \"History of the English Church and People,\" written in the early eighth century, the Venerable Bede provides details regarding its construction to early missionaries. Glastonbury fell into Saxon hands after the Battle of Peonnum in 658. King Ine of Wessex enriched the endowment of the community of monks already established at Glastonbury. He is said to have directed that a stone church be built in 712. The Abbey Church was enlarged in the 10th century by the Abbot of Glastonbury, Saint Dunstan, the central figure in the 10th-century revival of English monastic life. He instituted the Benedictine Rule at Glastonbury and built new cloisters. Dunstan became Archbishop of Canterbury in 960. In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury destroyed the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the Lady Chapel, which includes the well, was consecrated in 1186.\nThe abbey had a violent end during the Dissolution and the buildings were progressively destroyed as their stones were removed for use in local building work. The remains of the Abbot's Kitchen (a grade I listed building.) and the Lady Chapel are particularly well-preserved set in of parkland. It is approached by the Abbey Gatehouse which was built in the mid-14th century and completely restored in 1810.\n\nThe Church of St Benedict was rebuilt by Abbot Richard Beere in about 1520. This is an Anglican church and is linked with the parishes of St John's Church in Glastonbury and St Mary's & All Saints Church in the village of Meare as a joint benefice.\n\nDescribed as \"one of the most ambitious parish churches in Somerset\", the current Church of St John the Baptist dates from the 15th century and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The church is laid out in a cruciform plan with an aisled nave and a clerestorey of seven bays. The west tower has elaborate buttressing, panelling and battlements and at 134½ feet (about 41 metres), is the second tallest parish church tower in Somerset. Recent excavations in the nave have revealed the foundations of a large central tower, possibly of Saxon origin, and a later Norman nave arcade on the same plan as the existing one. A central tower survived until the 15th century, but is believed to have collapsed, at which time the church was rebuilt.\nThe interior of the church includes four 15th-century tomb-chests, some 15th-century stained glass in the chancel, medieval vestments, and a domestic cupboard of about 1500 which was once at Witham Charterhouse.\n\nIn the centuries that followed the Reformation, many religious denominations came to Glastonbury to establish chapels and meeting houses. For such a relatively small town, Glastonbury has a remarkably diverse history of Christian places of worship, further enriched by the fact that several of these movements saw break-away factions, typically setting up new meeting places as a result of doctrinal disagreements, leaving behind them a legacy which would require a highly specialized degree of study in order to chart their respective histories and places of practice. Amongst their number have been Puritans/Undetermined Protestants, Quakers, Independents, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists, Salvationists, Plymouth Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses and Pentecostals.\n\nThe United Reformed Church on the High Street was built in 1814 and altered in 1898. It stands on the site of the Ship Inn where meetings were held during the 18th century. It is Grade II listed.\n\nGlastonbury Methodist Church on Lambrook Street was built in 1843 and has a galleried interior, typical of a non-conformist chapel of that period, but an unusual number of stained glass windows. Close by the front of the church is an ancient pond, which was later covered to form a brick-arched reservoir. This is mentioned in property deeds of 1821, and is still accessible, containing approximately 31,500 gallons of water.\n\nThe Methodist Church on Lambrook street was originally the Glastonbury Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. A Primitive Methodist Chapel was built on Northload Street in 1844, with an adjoining house added for a minister in 1869. This chapel was closed in 1968, since which time it has had a number of different uses, being described in 2007 as the Maitreya Monastery, prior to which it had been the Archangel Michael Soul Therapy Centre.\n\nThe Catholic Church of Our Lady St Mary of Glastonbury was built, on land near to the Abbey, in 1939. A statue based on a 14th-century metal seal was blessed in 1955 and crowned in 1965 restoring the Marian shrine that had been in the Abbey prior to the reformation.\n\nThe Bove Town Gospel Hall was registered for the solemnizing of marriages in 1964 This has been a place of worship in the town since at least 1889, when it was listed as a mission of the Plymouth Brethren. Jehovah's Witnesses originally occupied a Kingdom Hall on Archer's Way from 1942. This transferred to Church Lane in 1964, and subsequently to its present site on Old Wells Road.\n\nAnd Glastonbury also headquarters the British Orthodox Church which is independent Oriental Orthodox denomination since 2015\n\nIn April 2012, it was reported by The Guardian newspaper that, according to the Pilgrim Reception Centre in the town, Glastonbury had around seventy different faith groups. Some of these groups attended a special ceremony to celebrate this diversity, held in the Chalice Well Gardens on 21 April of that year.\n\nThe pagan Glastonbury Goddess Temple was founded in 2002 and registered as a place of worship the following year. It is self-described as the first temple of its kind to exist in Europe in over a thousand years.\n\nThe 22nd Jagannatha Ratha-yatra Krishna Festival took place in Glastonbury on Sunday 4 October 2015. Devotees of the Krishna Consciousness movement travelled to the town from London, Bath, Bristol and elsewhere to join with locals in a procession and Kirtan.\n\nSufism has been long established in Glastonbury. Zikrs are held weekly in private homes, and on the first Sunday of every month a zikr is held at St Margaret's Chapel in Magdalene Street. A Sufi charity shop was established in Glastonbury in 1999, and supports missionary work in Africa. This shop was opened after Sheikh Nazim came to Glastonbury to visit the Abbey. Here he declared, “This is the spiritual heart of England ... It is from here that the spiritual new age will begin and to here that Jesus will return\".\n\nThe Glastonbury Order of Druids was formed on Mayday 1988.\n\nGlastonbury has a particular significance for members of the Bahá'í Faith in that Wellesley Tudor Pole, founder of the Chalice Well Trust, was one of the earliest and most prominent adherents of this faith in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe local football team is Glastonbury Town F.C. They joined the Western Football League Division Two as Glastonbury in 1919 and won the Western Football League title three times in their history. They changed their name to Glastonbury Town in 2003. For the 2010–11 season, they were members of the Somerset County Football League Premier Division.\n\nGlastonbury Cricket Club competes in the West of England Premier League, one of the ECB Premier Leagues, the highest level of recreational cricket in England and Wales. The club plays at the Tor Leisure Ground, which used to stage Somerset County Cricket Club first-class fixtures.\n\nThe town is on the route of the Samaritans Way South West.\n\nIn a 1904 novel by Charles Whistler entitled \"A Prince of Cornwall\" Glastonbury in the days of Ine of Wessex is portrayed. It is also a setting in the Warlord Chronicles, a trilogy of books about Arthurian Britain written by Bernard Cornwell. Modern fiction has also used Glastonbury as a setting including The Age of Misrule series of books by Mark Chadbourn in which the Watchmen appear, a group selected from Anglican priests in and around Glastonbury to safeguard knowledge of a gate to the Otherworld on top of Glastonbury Tor. John Cowper Powys's novel \"A Glastonbury Romance\" is set in Glastonbury and is concerned with the Grail. The historical mystery novel “Grave Goods” by Diana Norman (writing under the pen name Ariana Frankin) is set in Glastonbury just after the abbey fire and concerns the supposed graves of Arthur and Guinevere, as well as featuring other landmarks such as the Tor.\n\nThe Children's World charity grew out of the festival and is based in the town. It is known internationally (as \"Children's World International\"). It was set up by Arabella Churchill in 1981 to provide drama participation and creative play and to work creatively in educational settings, providing social and emotional benefits for all children, particularly those with special needs. Children's World International is the sister charity of Children's World and was started in 1999 to work with children in the Balkans, in conjunction with Balkan Sunflowers and Save the Children. They also run the Glastonbury Children's Festival each August.\n\nGlastonbury is one of the venues for the annual West Country Carnival.\n\nGlastonbury has been described as a New Age community where communities have grown up to include people with New Age beliefs.\n\nThe first Glastonbury Festivals were a series of cultural events held in summer, from 1914 to 1926. The festivals were founded by English socialist composer Rutland Boughton and his librettist Lawrence Buckley. Apart from the founding of a national theatre, they envisaged a summer school and music festival based on utopian principles. With strong Arthurian connections and historic and prehistoric associations, Glastonbury was chosen to host the festivals.\n\nThe more recent Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts, founded in 1970, is now the largest open-air music and performing arts festival in the world. Although it is named for Glastonbury, it is held at Worthy Farm between the small villages of Pilton and Pylle, east of the town of Glastonbury. The festival is best known for its contemporary music, but also features dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret and many other arts. For 2005, the enclosed area of the festival was over , had over 385 live performances and was attended by around 150,000 people. In 2007, over 700 acts played on over 80 stages and the capacity expanded by 20,000 to 177,000. The festival has spawned a range of other work including the 1972 film \"Glastonbury Fayre\" and album, 1996 film \"Glastonbury the Movie\" and the 2005 DVD \"Glastonbury Anthems\".\n\nGlastonbury has been the birthplace or home to many notable people. Peter King, 1st Baron King was the recorder of Glastonbury in 1705. Thomas Bramwell Welch the discoverer of the pasteurisation process to prevent the fermentation of grape juice was born in Glastonbury in 1825. The judge John Creighton represented Lunenburg County in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1770 to 1775. The fossil collector Thomas Hawkins lived in the town during the 19th century.\n\nThe religious connections and mythology of the town have also attracted several authors. The occultist and writer Dion Fortune (Violet Mary Firth) lived and is buried in Glastonbury. Her old house is now home to the writer and historian Geoffrey Ashe, who is known for his works on local legends. Frederick Bligh Bond, archaeologist and writer. Eckhart Tolle, a German-born writer, public speaker, and spiritual teacher lived in Glastonbury during the 1980s. Eileen Caddy was at a sanctuary in Glastonbury when she first claimed to have heard the \"voice of God\" while meditating. Her subsequent instructions from the \"voice\" directed her to take on Sheena Govan as her spiritual teacher, and became a spiritual teacher and new age author, best known as one of the founders of the Findhorn Foundation community. Sally Morningstar, a Wiccan High Priestess and the author of at least twenty-six books on magic, astrology, Ayurveda, Wicca, divination and spirituality teaches Hedge Witchcraft and Natural Magic in Glastonbury, and lives in Somerset.\n\nPopular entertainment and literature is also represented amongst the population. Rutland Boughton moved from Birmingham to Glastonbury in 1911 and established the country's first national annual summer school of music. Gary Stringer, lead singer of Reef, was a local along with other members of the band, as are the band Flipron. The juggler Haggis McLeod and his late wife, Arabella Churchill, one of the founders of the Glastonbury Festival, lived in the town. The author and dramatist Nell Leyshon and she has set much of her work in the local area. Sarah Fielding, the 18th-century author and sister of the novelist Henry Fielding, lived in the town. Michael Aldridge, a character actor who appeared as Seymour in the television series \"Last of the Summer Wine\", was born in Glastonbury. The conductor Charles Hazlewood lives locally and hosts the \"Play the Field\" music festival on his farm nearby. Bill Bunbury moved on from Glastonbury to become a writer, radio broadcaster, and producer for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nAthletes and sports players have also been resident. Cricketers born in the town include Cyril Baily in 1880, George Burrough in 1907, and Eustace Bisgood in 1878. The footballer Peter Spiring was born in Glastonbury in 1950.\n\nGlastonbury is twinned with:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "435135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435135", "title": "Grace Aguilar", "text": "Grace Aguilar\n\nGrace Aguilar (2 June 1816 – 16 September 1847) was an English novelist, poet and writer on Jewish history and religion. Although she had been writing since childhood, much of her work was published posthumously. Among those are her best known works, the novels \"Home Influence\" and \"A Mother's Recompense\".\n\nAguilar was the eldest child of Sephardic Jewish refugees from Portugal who settled in the London Borough of Hackney. An early illness resulted in her being educated by her parents, especially her mother, who taught her the tenets of Judaism. Later, her father taught the history of Spanish and Portuguese Jews during his own bout with tuberculosis which had led the family to move to the English coast. After surviving the measles at the age of 19, she began to embark on a serious writing career, even though her physical health never completely recovered.\n\nAguilar's debut was an anonymous collection of poems, \"The Magic Wreath of Hidden Flowers\". Three years later she translated Isaac Orobio de Castro's \"Israel Defended\" into English at her father's behest. Later her \"The Spirit of Judaism\" drew interest and sales in both Britain and the United States after being published in Philadelphia by Isaac Leeser. He added a preface to the work elucidating his differences with her, the first of many clashes her work would have with mainstream Jewish thought.\n\nIn the 1840s her novels began to attract regular readers, and Aguilar moved back to London with her parents. Despite her success, she and her mother still had to operate a boys' Hebrew school to stay solvent, which she resented for the time and energy it took from her writing. In 1847, she became ill again with a spinal paralysis which she did not let prevent her from visiting her brother in Frankfurt. Her health worsened and she died there that September.\n\nBorn in Hackney, London, in 1816, Grace Aguilar was the oldest child of parents descended from Portuguese Marranos who had sought asylum in England in the 18th century following the Portuguese Inquisition. Emanuel, her father, was the lay leader of London's Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, and her mother Sarah was active in the city's Jewish community as well. Her religious background and illnesses, both hers and her parents', were major factors in her life and influential on her work.\n\nFor her first eight years, Aguilar was an only child. During this time, Aguilar suffered from a chronic long-term illness that led her parents to educate her at home. Her mother, in keeping with post-Inquisition practice among Sephardic Jews from the Iberian Peninsula, educated the young Aguilar in her religion and its tenets. Her condition did not stop her from learning to dance and play the harp and piano, common pursuits for middle-class English girls of that era, or traveling—when her brother Emanuel was born in 1823, the family went on an extended tour of Gloucestershire.\n\nWhen Aguilar was twelve, her father contracted tuberculosis. For his health, the family relocated to the coast in Devon. While Grace was taking care of him, her father taught her the oral history of the Jews of Spain and Portugal, complementing her mother's earlier instruction in Judaism. He may also have taught her Hebrew, which was extremely unusual for a Jewish woman to know at that time. Both her religious and literary interests date to that time of her life; she began indulging them both by making her first efforts at poetry and fiction and attending some Protestant services. A collection of conch shells she found on a Teignmouth beach spurred her to attempt a scientific paper on the subject.\n\nSarah Aguilar's health took a turn for the worse during this period, as she recovered from surgical treatment for an illness that has not yet been identified from the records available, and Grace spent time taking care of her as she had her father. In 1835, at the age of 19, Grace was again taken ill herself, with measles. She never completely recovered.\n\nThe family moved to Brighton afterwards, perhaps to be closer to London's Jewish community. The two Aguilar boys had been sent to boarding school, but with her parents' health declining, Grace began to think about her responsibilities to not only them but her brothers as well. She decided to try making a living as a writer, and that year was able to get her first book of poems published. It was successful enough that a second run was printed in 1839, and she began writing in earnest.\n\nMuch of this work was published posthumously, with one exception. In 1838 Aguilar's father prevailed upon her to translate Isaac Orobio de Castro's \"Israel Defended\", an apologia for Judaism, from the original French for private distribution among Brighton's Jewish community. She added a preface that, albeit with some ambivalence, explained that she had softened Orobio's castigations of Christians as a result of the tolerance she felt Victorian England had shown to its Jewish population compared with Catholic Spain and Portugal. Two years later the family returned to London.\n\nThere, Aguilar befriended the young Benjamin Disraeli, whose father Isaac was a well-known author. The older man was able to help her find a publisher. He declined, but on her own she was able to persuade Isaac Leeser, editor of \"The Occident\", an American Jewish magazine, to publish her theological tract \"The Spirit of Judaism\" as the initial volume of a new series of books he was bringing out. The original manuscript was lost at sea, but Aguilar was able to recreate it from her notes, and it was published in 1842. When she received her copy, Aguilar was angry that Leeser had added a preface detailing his differences of opinion with Aguilar.\n\nThe book was nevertheless well-received, and Aguilar began publishing poems in small English journals. Isaac D'Israeli now chose to help her, possibly introducing her to Edward Moxon, his own publisher. Moxon in turn introduced her to R. Groombridge & Sons, the large publisher that would eventually bring out most of her work in Britain.\n\nDespite her anger over the preface he added to \"The Spirit of Judaism\", Aguilar continued to publish her poetry in Leeser's journals. She befriended Solomon Cohen, the first Jewish state senator in Georgia and his wife Miriam, which contributed to the success of her work in the South as they distributed her books widely there. In England, her domestic fiction drew readers and acclaim. However, she still needed to run a boys' Hebrew school with her mother to make enough money to live on, an obligation she complained about bitterly and repeatedly in her letters to Miriam Cohen, since she felt it took away from the time she had to write. She also anguished over the fate of her brother Henry, who had chosen a career as a sailor.\n\nThe last three years of her life were busy. Aguilar turned to nonfiction, producing \"Women of Israel\", an account of the lives of Jewish women that was recognized as her masterpiece. In 1845, the family was able to move again, to a house on Hackney's Clapton Square, where she tended to her father until his death the following year.\n\nIn 1847 Aguilar came down with a spinal paralysis; in spite of the illness she went ahead with a planned trip to Europe. Before her departure some Jewish women of London presented her with a gift and an address recounting her achievements in behalf of Judaism and Jewish women. She later visited Emanuel at Frankfurt, where he had become a successful musician. At first she seemed to benefit by the change of scene and climate, but after a few weeks she went to the baths of Schwalbach for treatment. More symptoms led her return to Frankfurt, where she died on 16 September 1847. Her remains were buried in the Jewish cemetery.\n\nAguilar's literary career began with the diary she started at seven and continued, uninterrupted, until her death. Before she was twelve she had written a drama, \"Gustavus Vasa\", which has since been lost. Her first verses were evoked two years later by the scenery about Tavistock in Devonshire. Her early collected poems, under the title \"The Magic Wreath of Hidden Flowers\", were published anonymously in 1835; each is a riddle with clues to the name of a particular flower.\n\nAguilar's productions are chiefly stories and religious works dealing with Jewish subjects. The former embrace domestic tales, tales founded on Marano history, and a romance of Scottish history, \"The Days of Bruce\" (1852). The most popular of the Jewish tales is \"The Vale of Cedars, or the Martyr: A Story of Spain in the Fifteenth Century\", written before 1835, published in 1850, and twice translated into German and twice into Hebrew. Her other stories founded on Jewish episodes are included in a collection of nineteen tales, \"Home Scenes and Heart Studies\" (published posthumously 1852); \"The Perez Family\" (1843) and \"The Edict\" together with \"The Escape\", had appeared as two separate volumes; the others were reprinted from magazines. Her domestic tales are \"Home Influence\" (1847) and its sequel, \"The Mother's Recompense\" (1850), both of them written early in 1836, \"Woman's Friendship\" (1851), and \"Helon: A Fragment from Jewish History\" (1852).\n\nThe first of Aguilar's religious works was a translation of the French version of \"Israel Defended,\" by the Marrano Orobio de Castro, printed for private circulation. It was closely followed by \"The Spirit of Judaism,\" the publication of which was for a time prevented by the loss of the original manuscript. Sermons by Rabbi Isaac Leeser, of Philadelphia, had fallen into her hands and, like all other accessible Jewish works, had been eagerly read. She requested him to revise the manuscript of the \"Spirit of Judaism\", which was forwarded to him, but was lost. The author rewrote it; and in 1842 it was published in Philadelphia, with notes by Leeser. A second edition was issued in 1849 by the first American Jewish Publication Society; and a third (Cincinnati, 1864) has an appendix containing thirty-two poems (bearing date 1838-1847), all but two reprinted from \"The Occident\". The editor's notes serve mainly to mark dissent from Aguilar's depreciation of Jewish tradition — due probably to her Marrano ancestry and to her country life, cut off from association with Jews. In 1845 \"The Women of Israel\" appeared—a series of portraits delineated according to the Scriptures and Josephus. This was soon followed by \"The Jewish Faith: Its Spiritual Consolation, Moral Guidance, and Immortal Hope,\" in thirty-one letters, the last dated September, 1846. Of this work—addressed to a Jewess under the spell of Christian influence, to demonstrate to her the spirituality of Judaism—the larger part is devoted to immortality in the Old Testament. Aguilar's other religious writings —some of them written as early as 1836—were collected in a volume of \"Essays and Miscellanies\" (1851–52). The first part consists of \"Sabbath Thoughts\" on Scriptural passages and prophecies; the second, of \"Communings\" for the family circle.\n\nIn her religious writings Aguilar's attitude was defensive. Despite her almost exclusive intercourse with Christians and her utter lack of prejudice, her purpose, apparently, was to equip English Jewish women with arguments against conversionists. She inveighed against formalism, and laid stress upon knowledge of Jewish history and the Hebrew language. In view of the neglect of the latter by women (to whom she modestly confined her expostulations), she constantly pleaded for the reading of the Scriptures in the English version. Her interest in the reform movement was deep; yet, despite her attitude toward tradition, she observed ritual ordinances punctiliously. Her last work was a sketch of the \"History of the Jews in England\", written for \"Chambers's Miscellany.\" In point of style it is the most finished of her productions, free from the exuberances and redundancies that disfigure the tales—published, for the most part, posthumously by her mother. The defects of her style are mainly chargeable to youth. With her extraordinary industry—she rose early and employed the day systematically—and her growing ability of concentration she gave promise of noteworthy productions.\n\n\nThe Aguilar branch of the New York Public Library, located in the East Harlem section of New York City is named after Grace Aguilar.\n\n\n"}

His body of work challenges the existing paradigms of orthodox (neo-classical) economics, climate-mitigation economics, Marxism, neo-Darwinism, evolutionary psychology, self-organisation theory, and all other supply-side systems.\"\n\nFor twenty-one years, from 1989 to 2010, Graeme Snooks was the foundation Coghlan Research Professor of Economics in the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University. Currently he is the Executive Director of both the Institute of Global Dynamic Systems and IGDS Books in Canberra. He was educated at Mount Lawley Senior High School (1957–1961), the University of Western Australia (BEc,1966; MEc, 1968), and the Australian National University (PhD, 1972). Professor Snooks has been elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences (1991), Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (UK) (1990), and Fellow of the Russian Academy of Humanities (2006).\n\nProfessor Snooks has published 30 books, including: \"Depression and Recovery\" (1974), \"Domesday Economy\" (with J.

And second, the contribution of DNA testing to the exploration of societal dynamics over the past 60,000 years. \n\nArticles on the theory of complex living systems have been published by Snooks in \"Advances in Space Research\" (2005), \"Complexity\" (the journal of the Santa Fe Institute) (2008), and Social Evolution & History (2002, 2005, 2007). In a recent (11 November 2016) article - The Triumph of Trump and the failure of the intellectuals - he applies the dynamic-strategy theory to the recent US Presidential election (see Graeme Snooks, Researchgate) and provides suggestions for the type of dynamic strategy that the USA would need to pursue in order to \"make America great again\" and to position itself at the forefront of the forthcoming technological paradigm shift.\n\n"}

Her husband was Karl Polanyi and her daughter is Kari Polanyi Levitt.\n\nIn 1897, Ilona Duczynska was born near Vienna to a Hungarian mother and a Polish-Austrian father. In 1915, during the First World War, she became acquainted with anarcho-syndicalist revolutionary Ervin Szabó, who connected her with the work of the Galileo Circle. She became a revolutionary socialist. For her anti-war activities, she was expelled from school in 1915. She studied engineering at the Technical University of Zurich. There she was befriended by a community of representatives of the Russian Social Democratic Party opposed to the war, including Lenin, his wife Krupskaya, and Angelica Balabanoff. Together with delegations from Germany, France, and Britain, as well as other European Labour and Socialist parties, they met to draft a program of action against the war, known as the Zimmerwald Declaration (see Zimmerwald Conference). The 18-year-old Duczynska was entrusted to smuggle this call to action into Hungary.\n\nIn Hungary, she took part in the early 1918 strikes that called successfully for workers' councils. During the Galilei trial, she was imprisoned. In the Aster Revolution, she and other revolutionaries were freed. On November 17, 1918, she married Tivadar Sugar and soon after joined the Hungarian Communist Party. During the Hungarian Soviet Republic, she worked in the propaganda department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and she was a member of the Budapest Central Revolutionary Worker and Soldier Council.\n\nShe fled to Vienna to escape the counter-revolution in Hungary. With an excellent education and knowledge of several languages, she was called to Moscow to serve as translator to Karl Radek in the preparations for the historic Second International Congress of Communist Parties. Ilona returned to Vienna in 1920, and subsequently was expelled from the party for \"Luxembourgist deviations\" and a publication in a journal edited by Paul Levi, who also fell into disfavor with the party. In 1922, she divorced Tivadar Sugar. The next year she married Karl Polanyi and their only child Kari was born. From 1927, she edited the \"Der linke Sozialdemokrat\" and organized the left opposition in the Vienna branch of the Austrian Socialist Party. Her underground name in Vienna was \"Anna Novotny.\" In 1929, she returned to university, the Technical University of Vienna, studying technology, mechanics, mechanical drawing, electronics, and electric number theory.\n\nIn 1933 Karl emigrated to England followed by Kari in 1934 and Ilona in 1936. Duczynska participated in the 1934 workers' uprising in Vienna. Following the destruction of the Austrian working class movement in February 1934, Duczynska rejoined the Communist Party in order to continue the struggle of the now-illegal Schutzbund, the military arm of the Austrian Social Democratic Party, until 1936 when she joined her family in London. Subsequently, she was expelled from the Austrian Communist Party in London on orders from Moscow.\n\nWhen she returned to England from Bennington, Vermont in 1942/3, she worked in the Political Intelligence department of Foreign Affairs. During World War II she also worked for the Royal Aircraft Establishment testing model aircraft in wind tunnels for a year or perhaps two.\n\nAfter World War II, the family moved to Canada.

He commuted to New York City from Canada.

The end of World War II should have resulted in the end of the Allied joint occupation of Iran. Instead, Pro-Soviet Iranians proclaimed the separatist Azerbaijan People's Government and the Kurdish separatist Republic of Mahabad. The United States pressured Soviet withdrawal in the earliest success of the new containment strategy.\n\nAs of August 1941, the United States was a neutral nation and had not yet entered as a belligerent in World War II. Therefore, the bloc known as 'The Allies' were principally (with Poland and France occupied by Germany in 1939 and 1940, respectively) the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, recently forming their alliance after the German invasion of territories of the Western Soviet Union in June 1941. In August–September 1941, Pahlavi Iran had been jointly invaded and occupied by the Allied powers of the Soviet Red Army in the north and by the British in the centre and south. Iran was used by the Americans and the British as a transportation route to provide vital supplies to the Soviet Union's war efforts.\n\nIn the aftermath of the occupation of Iran, those Allied forces agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities. However, when this deadline came in early 1946, the Soviets, under Joseph Stalin, remained in Iran. Soon, the alliance of the Kurdish and People's Azerbaijani forces, supported in arms and training by the Soviet Union, engaged in fighting with Iranian forces, resulting in a total of 2,000 casualties. Negotiation by Iranian premier Ahmad Qavam and diplomatic pressure on the Soviets by the United States eventually led to Soviet withdrawal and dissolution of the separatist Azeri and Kurdish states.\n\nAfter Germany broke its pact with the Soviets and invaded the USSR in June 1941, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union jointly occupied Iran as a preventative measure, starting on August 25, 1941, and justified their invasion by the need to use Iran as a gateway for delivery of Lend-Lease supplies to the Soviet Union. As a result, Rezā Shāh was forced to abdicate on September 16, 1941 and exiled to Mauritius; his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the crown prince, became the new monarch. Their joint 'Tripartite Treaty' of January 1942 declared that their military presence was not an occupation, proclaimed Iran to be their ally, and pledged to withdraw their troops within six months of the end of the war.\n\nThroughout the rest of the war, the United Kingdom and the United States used Iran as an important supply line to the Soviet war effort against Nazi Germany. Thirty thousand non-combatant US troops arrived to move these supplies, and transit through Iran was later termed a \"bridge to victory\". At the Teheran Conference in 1943, the Big Three gave additional assurances concerning Iran's future sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as a promise to assist in its post-war reconstruction and development.\n\nAlthough the occupation of Iran was scheduled to end after the war at the Potsdam Conference following Germany's surrender, Stalin objected to Churchill's proposal for an early allied withdrawal from Iran ahead of the agreed-upon schedule set at the Teheran Conference. Following VJ Day in September 1945, first the US and then the UK withdrew their forces within the treaty-stipulated period. The Soviets not only violated the March 2 withdrawal deadline; in that time they had expanded their military presence southward. By mid-December 1945, with the use of troops and secret police, they had set up two pro-Soviet \"People's Democratic Republics\" within Iranian territory, the Azerbaijan People's Republic headed by Sayyid Jafar Pishevari and the Kurdish Republic of Mahabad under President Pesheva Qazi Muhammad.\n\nThe Azerbaijani Democratic Party (ADP) was formed in September 1945 and headed by Jafar Pishevari, a long-time leader of the revolutionary movement in Gilan. The ADP expanded throughout Iranian Azerbaijan, and initiated a local coup d'état with help from the Soviet army, who prevented the Iranian army from intervening. During the first week of September 1945, the Azerbaijani Democratic Party declared itself to be in control of Iranian Azerbaijan, promised liberal democratic reforms, and disbanded the local branch of Tudeh, the Iranian communist party.\n\nLater in September 1945, at its first congress, the Azerbaijani Democratic Party authorized the formation of a peasant's militia, which by mid-November 1945 captured all remaining government posts in the province, and Iranian Azerbaijan \"became an autonomous republic under the direction of a 39-member national and no\nexecutive committee\". The only Prime Minister of this short-lived republic was Ahmad Kordary (variously spelled Kordari or Kodari).\n\nThough the Soviets initially supported the new autonomous entity and prevented the Iranian army from restoring governmental control over the area, it did not last for long. After the Soviet withdrawal, Iranian troops entered the region in December 1946 and Pishevari and his cabinet fled to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Mahabad Republic was proclaimed in December 1945. Leading the nascent Kurdish republic and fully endorsed by the Soviets, was Qazi Muhammad, the religious and titular leader of Mahabad. Despite Soviet opposition, Mullah Mustafa Barzani came to play an important role in the newly created military force of the Mahabad Republic - the Peshmerga. With Barzani's support secured, along with some 60 tribal Kurdish leaders, the KDP-I party platform had been established and Qazi Muhammad was elected the first president on 22 January 1946.\n\nThe Kurdish forces were advised and organized by Soviet military officer Captain Salahuddin Kazimov. The Soviets extended their influence by sending at least 60 Kurds to Soviet Azerbaijan for additional military training. In total, the Mahabad army consisted of 70 active duty officers, 40 non-commissioned officers, and 1,200 lower-enlisted privates.\n\nOn 29 April 1946, only five days after the Mahabad Republic signed a military cooperation accord with neighboring Azerbaijan, the First Kurdish Regiment, located in the southeast corner of the republic in Qahrawa, faced 600 Iranian soldiers reinforced with artillery and cavalry. In this engagement, the peshmerga under Barzani were successful against Iranian forces, ambushing the first Iranian units to reach Qahrawa, killing 21, wounding 17 and capturing 40, making it the first victory for the Mahabad Republic.\n\nThe Mahabad peshmerga also engaged Iranian reconnaissance teams in the region throughout early May 1946. Kurdish offensives were limited to minor skirmishes due to the removal of Soviet influence in the region that month, possibly due to a Soviet-Iranian oil agreement. A ceasefire agreement, signed on 3 May 1946 between Kurdish forces and Iranian General Ali Razmara, discouraged major attacks, promoted withdrawals, and allowed each side to further equip their forces in the region.\n\nOn 15 June 1946, this period of preparation ended, as the fighting positions of the Second Kurdish Regiment at Mamashah (Mil Qarani) were attacked by two Iranian battalions supported by artillery, tanks, and aircraft. The resulting Kurdish defeat enabled the Iranian military to seize the highlands, erect military watchtowers, and maintain a military presence in the area. Lack of tribal unity promoted deterioration of the Mahabad Republic following the Battle of Mamashah.\n\nAs tribal support for Qazi Muhammad's government waned, the Barzani Peshmerga were left as Mahabad's lone fighting force. As a result, the Mahabad position became hopeless by late 1946, as even promised Soviet aid failed to arrive. The Mahabad Republic faced its most difficult challenge as Iranian forces planned to reclaim Mahabad, following the seizure of Iranian Azerbaijan in December 1946. Though some opposition remained, eventually the sides turned to negotiations. The Barzanis, including the Peshmerga and their families, withdrew to Naqada on 15 December 1946 and the Iranian military entered Mahabad, officially ending the one-year life of the Kurdish Republic.\n\nDespite the attempts to disarm Mahabad forces, the Peshmerga succeeded in smuggling out much of their weaponry. In March 1947, they faced their Iranian foes once again. In various battles throughout mid-March, the Peshmerga defended themselves against numerous offensives as Iranian forces continued their attacks, often recruiting rival Kurdish tribes to oust the Barzanis. The Peshmerga even achieved several victories, among which was the Battle of Nalos, where Peshmerga forces effectively used their artillery to kill many Iranian soldiers, including Colonel Kalashi, the Iranian regiment commander, and took many prisoners of war. The ambush of an Iranian military column also resulted in the deaths of fifty Iranian soldiers and the capture of Iranian Lieutenant Jahanbani, son of General Jahanbani. However, with his forces withering under the continuous attack, Mustafa Barzani realized the need to flee Iran and cross the border into Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nThe Peshmerga and Barzani leadership crossed into Iraq in two waves, and though successful in overcoming the Iraqi police and \"jash\" forces, whom they met on their way to Barzan, Sheikh Ahmed Barzani was arrested by the Iraqi government and Mustafa Barzani was requested to surrender. When the Iraqis began to mobilize troops to seek Mustafa's defeat and surrender, he decided on evacuation towards the Soviet Union. The journey began on May 1947, with the forces of Barzani engaging in skirmishes with the Iranian military on their way.\n\nOn 9 June 1947, the Peshmerga attacked the flank of an army column. During the two-pronged attack, led by both Mustafa Barzani and As'ad Khoshavi, the Peshmerga killed hundreds of Iranian soldiers, destroyed several tanks, knocked out an artillery battery and downed an Iranian aircraft. After evading or engaging the Iranian army throughout their trip, the Barzanis, along with over 500 Peshmerga and their families, crossed the Araxes River into the Soviet Union on 18 June 1947.\n\nThe United States exerted intense pressure on the Soviet Union in stages to force the withdrawal of the Red Army from Iran and reduce Soviet influence. Following an official US protest, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2, on January 30, 1946; the Soviets replied on March 24, 1946 and pledged immediate withdrawal, but in fact remained for a few more weeks.\n\nIn a second stage through the spring, the US supported the Iranian complaint against Soviet actions lodged with the Security Council in Resolution 3 and Resolution 5.\n\nIn a third stage in mid December 1946, the US supported the shah's government in sending the Iranian army to re-occupy Mahabad and Azerbaijan. The leaders of the Azerbaijan enclave in Iran fled to the Azerbaijan SSR, and the leaders of the Kurdish Republic were tried and sentenced to death. They were hanged in Chwarchira Square in the center of Mahabad in 1947.\n\nA fourth stage was initiated in 1947 and centered on the issue of Soviet designs on Iran's northern oil resources. Following the election that year of a new Majlis, the newly elected deputies were reluctant to ratify the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement, which had been concluded under duress in March 1946 and had granted the Soviets 51% ownership and \"de facto\" control. On September 11, 1947, US ambassador George V. Allen publicly decried intimidation and coercion used by foreign governments to secure commercial concessions in Iran, and promised full US support for Iran to freely decide about its own natural resources. With this unequivocal encouragement, the Majlis refused to ratify the Soviet oil agreement on October 22, 1947; the vote was 102 to 2.\n\nThis conflict was one of the first episodes of the Cold War outside Europe, and was a factor in the evolving and increasingly contentious political relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, which followed their joint victory in World War II. According to Lenczowski, U.S. President Truman's actions laid the foundations of US relations with Iran, and were based on his understanding of the nature of the Soviet system and its expansionist proclivities, as well as on his conviction that Soviet threats and aggression should be contained, with force if necessary.\n\nSoviet influence and expansion occurred elsewhere in Southwest Asia also and led to the Truman Doctrine of the Cold War. Taking Truman's cue, successive US presidents enlarged and refined their policies toward Iran by extending economic and technical assistance, strengthening its military potential, establishing closer cultural ties, and integrating Iran into the regional security system encompassing the other countries of the 'Northern Tier' of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.\n\n\n\n"}

The reigning emperor was .\n\n\n\n\"Between 1229 and 1232, the Kangi famine struck. Possibly the worst famine in Japanese history, it was caused by unusually cold, damp weather related to world-wide volcanic activity. The weather was so severe that snow fell in central Japan in the summer of 1230, while aristocrats noted days when the sun did not shine and complained because they had to wear heavy clothing even in the spring and summer. The death toll was high—in 1231, in one estate in central Japan about twenty percent of cultivators died in less than a month.\"\n\n\"Both governments attempted to ameliorate the harsh conditions but to little avail. Law and order broke down; countermeasures against nocturnal marauders and “evil monks” were largely ineffectual. Outlawry even affected relations with the Korean kingdom of Koryō when hungry residents of Kyushu raided the neigh boring peninsula for food. The famine also led to numerous quarrels between on-site warrior landlords and urban proprietors, with many estates unable to pay taxes or organize labor gangs. When harvests were inadequate, warriors also pressured and abused hapless cultivators, driving them from their fields. Both Kyoto and Kamakura took steps to make more grain available to commoners, but the results of their actions were only modest.\"\n\n\"The most important countermeasure taken to try to reduce the impact of the lengthy crop failure was the legalization of the sale of human beings. When a family was faced with starvation, members might choose to sell children or other kin in return for grain, at the same time ensuring enough to eat for the sellers and the person to be sold. This behavior had been going on illegally for centuries, but its official authorization from 1231 to 1239 showed just how severe the Kangi famine was. The policy helped to spread starving victims around to people who could take care of them, but it also ripped more families asunder.\"\n\n\"ln addition, all those sold became members of a servile class, dwelling in small lean-tos or perhaps even in a room of their master’s house. These conditions did not encourage large. stable families. The new policy may have saved some lives, but the creation of so many dependent, broken, and poor families helped lower fertility, making recovery from the famine even more difficult. After the famine in 1239, the bakufu tried to abrogate the more lenient laws, without success. The famine expanded the size of the servile class considerably; it was to remain a significant proportion of Japanese society for the next four hundred years[ ... ]\"\n\n"}

{"id": "19781676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19781676", "title": "Michael Hudson (economist)", "text": "Michael Hudson (economist)\n\nMichael Hudson (born March 14, 1939) is an American economist, Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri–Kansas City and a researcher at the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College, former Wall Street analyst, political consultant, commentator and journalist. He is a contributor to \"The Hudson Report\", a weekly economic and financial news podcast produced by Left Out. Paul Craig Roberts argues that he is the best contemporary economist.\n\nHudson graduated from the University of Chicago (B.A., 1959) and New York University (MA, 1965, PhD, 1968) and worked as a balance of payment economist in Chase Manhattan Bank (1964–1968). He was assistant professor of economics at the New School for Social Research (1969–1972) and worked for various governmental and non-governmental organizations as an economic consultant (1980s–1990s).\n\nHudson has extensively studied economic theories of many schools, including Physiocracy, classical political economy (Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx, among others), neoclassical, Keynesian, post-Keynesian, Modern Monetary Theory and many others. He identifies himself as a Marxist economist, though his interpretation of Marx is almost unique to him and differs from other major Marxists.\n\nHudson devoted his entire scientific career to the study of debt, both domestic (loans, mortgages and interest payments) and external. In his works, he consistently advocates the idea that loans and exponentially growing debts that outstrip profits from the economy of the real sphere are disastrous for both the government and the people of the borrowing state as they wash money (going to payments to usurers and rentiers) from turnover, not leaving them to buy goods and services and thus lead to debt deflation of the economy. Hudson notes that the existing economic theory (the Chicago School in particular) is in the service of rentiers and financiers and has developed a special language designed to create the impression that the current \"status quo\" has no alternative. In a false theory, the parasitic encumbrances of a real economy, instead of being deducted in accounting, add up as an addition to GDP (gross domestic product) and are presented as productive. Hudson sees consumer protection, state support of infrastructure projects and taxation of parasitic rentier sectors of the economy instead of taxing workers as a continuation of the line of classical economists today.\n\nHudson was born on March 14, 1939 in Chicago, Illinois. Hudson is a fifth generation American as on the maternal line he has the blood of the Ojibwe Indians. His father Nathaniel Carlos Hudson (1908–2003) received an economics education at Minnesota University. After completing his studies in 1929, the year of the Great Depression, his father actively joined the trade union struggle, became an active Trotskyist trade unionist, editor of the \"Northwest Organizer\" and \"The Industrial Organizer\" and wrote articles for other trade union publications. When he was 3 years old, his father was arrested and was subject to the Smith Act, which was aimed at fighting the Trotskyists in the United States.\n\nHudson received primary and secondary education in a private school at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. After his graduation, he entered the University of Chicago into two specialties—the main was Germanic philology as an additional history was chosen. In 1959, Hudson graduated from the University of Chicago with a bachelor's degree. After graduation, he worked as an assistant to Jeremy Kaplan at Free Press in Chicago. He managed to obtain the rights to the English-language editions of the works of György Lukács as well as the rights to the archives and works of Leon Trotsky after the death of his widow Natalia Sedova.\n\nHowever, the work on the publishing house was neither interesting nor profitable. As a result, Hudson, who had studied music from his childhood, moved to New York in 1960 in the hope of becoming a pupil of the world-famous conductor Dimitris Mitropoulos, but these plans were not to be realized. In New York, his friend Gavin McFadyen introduced him to the father of his girlfriend, economist Terence McCarthy. At the first meeting, McCarthy took Hudson with his vivid description of the internal interconnection of natural and financial cycles, the nature of money and public debt. Accidental acquaintance became shipborne for Hudson as he refused to study music in favor of studying economics and McCarthy became his spiritual mentor and teacher. Hudson recalled: \"And he described it and it was such a beautiful, aesthetic flow of funds that, believe it or not, I got into economics, because it was beautiful and aesthetic. [...] And Terence, I must have talked to him every day for an hour a day for 30 years\".\n\nIn 1961, Hudson enrolled in the Economics Department of New York University. His master's thesis was devoted to the development philosophy of the World Bank and special attention was paid to credit policy in the agricultural sector. Many years later, Hudson recognized: \"The topics that most interested me – and the focus of this book – were not taught at New York University where I took my graduate economics degrees. In fact, they are not taught in any university departments: the dynamics of debt, and how the pattern of bank lending inflates land prices, or national income accounting and the rising share absorbed by rent extraction in the Finance, Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE) sector. There was only one way to learn how to analyze these topics: to work for banks\".\n\nTo find out how finance works in reality, Hudson in parallel with training at the Faculty of Economics began to work in a bank: \"My first job was as mundane as could be imagined: an economist for the Savings Banks Trust Company. No longer existing, it had been created by New York’s then-127 savings banks (now also extinct, having been grabbed, privatized and emptied out by commercial bankers). I was hired to write up how savings accrued interest and were recycled into new mortgage loans. My graphs of this savings upsweep looked like Hokusai’s \"Wave,\" but with a pulse spiking like a cardiogram every three months on the day quarterly dividends were credited\".\n\nIn 1964, Hudson, who had just received his master's degree in economics, joined Chase Manhattan Bank's research economics department as a balance-of-payments specialist. His task was to establish the payment capacity of Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Based on data on their export earnings and other international payments, Hudson had to find out what kind of income the bank could get from the debt payments that these countries had accumulated. He recalled as such: \"I soon found that the Latin American countries I analyzed were fully \"loaned up.\" There were no more hard-currency inflows available to extract as interest on new loans or bond issues. In fact, there was capital flight\". Among other important tasks that Hudson performed in Chase Manhattan were an analysis of the balance of payments of the American oil industry and the tracking of dirty money that settled in the banks of Switzerland. According to Hudson, this work has given him invaluable experience in understanding how banks and the financial sector work as well as understanding how banking accounting and real life correlate. It was during the study of oil companies' flows (the study was funded by Chase Manhattan and Socony Oil Company) that Hudson met with Alan Greenspan (future Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors) who acted as an observer for Socony Oil. Hudson recalled that Greenspan had already successfully lobbied the interests of his clients in those years and in the framework of the research tried to provide rough estimates of the American market based on global trends: \"Mr. Rockefeller, Chase President, told me to inform Mr. Greenspan that unless he could provide specifically US figures, and/or be forthright about his assumptions, we would have to leave his contribution out of the study\"..\n\nHudson left his job at the bank to complete his doctoral dissertation. His thesis was devoted to American economic and technological thought in the 19th century. It was successfully defended in 1968 and in 1975 it was published under the title \"Economics and Technology in the 19th Century American Thought: The Neglected American Economists\". In 1968, Hudson joined the major audit company Arthur Andersen, for which he expanded his analysis of payment flows for all areas of American production. He found out that the United States deficit was manifested only in the military sphere: \"My charts revealed that the U.S. payments deficit was entirely military in character throughout the 1960s. The private sector – foreign trade and investment – was exactly in balance, year after year, and \"foreign aid\" actually produced a dollar surplus (and was required to do so under U.S. law)\". However, the accounting system, which was used in the United States after the war, mixed the balance of individuals and state payments-flow into a single balance which successfully concealed the budget deficit. Hudson supposed to divide United States balance of payments into government and private sectors.\n\nIn 1968, Hudson published a 100-page brochure titled \"A financial payments-flow analysis of U.S. international transactions, 1960-1968\" in which he pointed out the problems in the modern accounting system and the need to distinguish between state deficits and private payments. After the appearance of the brochure, Hudson was invited to speak to the graduate economics faculty of The New School in 1969, where it turned out that faculty needed someone to teach international trade and finance, therefore he was offered the job immediately after the lecture. According to Hudson, he was surprised to find that the university program almost did not address the issues of debt, financial flows, money laundering and the like. Particular attention that Hudson paid to these issues in his lectures aroused criticism from Economics Department Chairman Robert Heilbroner, who noted that even the teachers do not make such an accent on such issues.\n\nIn 1972, Hudson published his first major book titled \"Super Imperialism\" in which he showed how the after abandoning the dollar-gold line the United States created a unique situation when United States Department of the Treasury bonds became the sole basis for global reserves and foreign governments had no choice but to finance the budget deficit in the United States and hence their military expenditures. After the publication of the book, Hudson left the institute and moved to work in the think tank Hudson Institute headed by Herman Kahn. In 1979, he became an advisor to the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). He wrote reports for the Ministry of Defense and also acted as a consultant to the Canadian government. His second big book titled \"Global Fracture: The New International Economic Order\" was published in 1977. In it, Hudson argued that the military superiority of the United States led to the division of the world along financial lines.\n\nAfter the meeting in Mexico where his warning of the debt bondage that the Latin American countries are getting into caused a storm of protests, he left his job at UNITAR and left the field of modern economy as a whole. Instead, Hudson decided to study the historical roots of debt, how debts were formed in ancient Rome, Greece and Sumer. The painstaking reconstruction of the scattered material led him to a striking conclusion, namely that loans in the ancient Sumer were issued not only by individuals, but initially mainly by temples and palaces. State creditors were interested in the fact that the balance of the economy was not violated, therefore the state did not allow citizens to get into debt bondage in relation to other citizens. Hudson soon became a scientific researcher at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. With the help of Harvard scholars, Hudson founded the Institute for the Study of the Establishment of Long-Term Economic Trends and later became the founder of the International Scholars Conference on Ancient Near Eastern Economies which organized a series of innovative symposiums. At the same time, he continues to work as a financial consultant. In 1989, he joined the government bond fund Scudder Stevens and Clark.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Hudson became a Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri–Kansas City and a fellow at the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College. In the early 2000s, he issued a warning that the growing inflation and the strengthening of debt mortgage bondage will lead to a crisis. Much earlier in the 1980s, Hudson asked several publishers to publish a book in which he would show that the growth of a mortgage bubble is inevitably leading to a crisis, but publishers refused to print such a work: \"They told me that this was like telling people that good sex would stop at an early age\". In 2004, Hudson wrote several popular articles for \"Harper's Magazine\" in which he outlined his vision of the problem. When the crisis erupted in 2008, the \"Financial Times\" named him one of eight economists who foresaw the crisis. Hudson himself argued that the approach of the crisis was seen by everyone except economists from Wall Street.\n\nCurrently the director of the Institute for the Study of Long-Term Economic Trends and the Distinguished Research Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri–Kansas City, actively writes books and makes comments in the press. He is a contributor to \"The Hudson Report\", a weekly economic and financial news podcast produced by Left Out.\n\nHudson devoted his first works to the problem of the gold and foreign exchange reserves and the foreign economic debt of the United States, a subject that his mentor Terence McCarthy had previously dealt with in detail. In his first article titled \"Sieve of gold\", Hudson turned to an analysis of the disastrous economic consequences that the Vietnam War entailed. At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that even without war the United States economy very soon came to a critical point as the welfare of the United States in the postwar years was in many cases provided with a \"golden pillow\", which was accumulated for interwar and war years. Since 1934 when frightened by Adolf Hitler, Europeans began to buy up United States government securities, thereby shifting their gold and foreign exchange reserves to United States banks. Since 1934, the United States gold and foreign exchange reserves also increased from $7.4 billion to $20.1 billion in 1945. After the creation of the Bretton Woods system, an International Monetary Fund was created within the framework as well as a gold pool that guaranteed that the dollar was as good as gold, capital began to leave the country and move to Europe. Military expenditures accounted for a huge share of the United States budget deficit, which tried in vain ways to prevent further growth in the deficit, on the one hand in every way limiting the flow of gold and on the other hand not allowing foreign central banks to receive gold for the given dollars. Such a policy appealed to European bankers who found such a policy hypocritical, but could not do anything because they were afraid to bring down the dollar and thereby deprive their producers of competitiveness in American markets.\n\nIn \"A Financial Payments-Flow Analysis of U.S. International Transactions, 1960-1968\", Hudson showed that United States export statistics erroneously include a class of goods whose transfer abroad does not involve payment at any time from residents of one nation to those of another and which are for this reason not really international transactions at all. Primary among this class of goods are the transfers of aircraft parts and components by the United States. international airlines to their overseas air terminals and installation on their aircraft. These transfers were brought into the host country under bond and therefore were excluded from their import statistics. At the same time, their value was included in the United States export statistics as a credit, therefore the government sector has been in sizable deficit on a payments-flow basis during 1960–1968, resulting mainly from its military operations, but existing account system that mixed government and private flows did not show the existing problem and the source of deficit as well. In his monograph, Hudson made an attempt to divide the United States balance of payments into government and private sectors.\n\nIn 1972, Hudson published \"Superimperialism\", which traced the history of the formation of American imperialism after the end of World War I. In Hudson's interpretation, super-imperialism is a stage of imperialism in which the state does not realize the interests of any group, but it is itself wholly and entirely aimed at imperializing the seizure of other states. Continuing the position outlined in \"A Financial Payments-Flow Analysis of U.S. International Transactions, 1960-1968\", Hudson stressed the aid system formed after the end of World War II was called upon to solve the problem of the economy. All American foreign politics (including tied aid and debts) were aimed at restraining the economic development of Third World countries in those sectors of the economy where the United States was afraid of the emergence of competition. At the same time, the United States actively imposed free trade policies on developing countries, a policy that was the reverse of the one that led their country to prosperity.\n\nAfter the cancellation of the conversion of dollars into gold, the United States forced foreign central banks to buy United States treasuries that are used to finance the federal deficit and large military. In exchange for providing a net surplus of assets, commodities, debt financing, goods and services, foreign countries are forced to hold an equal amount of United States treasuries. It drives United States interest rates down, which drives down the dollar's foreign exchange rate.\n\nHudson views foreign central banks buying treasuries as a legitimate effort to stabilize exchange rates rather than a currency manipulation. Foreign central banks could sell the excess dollars on the exchange market which would appreciate their currency, but he calls this a dilemma because it decreases their ability to continue a trade surplus even though it would also increase their purchasing power. He believes keyboard credit and treasury outflows in exchange for foreign assets without a future means for the United States to repay the treasuries and a decreasing value of the dollar is akin to military conquest. He believes balance of payments surplus countries have the right to stabilize exchange rates and expect repayment of the resulting loans even as industry shifts from the United States to creditor nations. He states the Washington Consensus has encouraged the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to impose austerity that the United States itself is not exposed to thanks to dollar dominance, which leads to subjecting other countries to unfair trade that depletes natural resources and privatizing infrastructure that is sold at distressed prices that uses parasitic finance techniques (including Western-style tax breaks) to extract the maximum amount of the country's surplus rather than providing a price-competitive service.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s, Hudson left the field of modern economy and started exploration of history of debt. He found that the first and by far the earliest major creditors were the temples and palaces of Bronze Age Mesopotamia, not private individuals acting on their own. The rate of interest in each region was not based on productivity, but was set purely for simplicity of calculation in the local system of fractional arithmetic, i.e. 1/60th per month in Mesopotamia and later 1/10th per year for Greece and 1/12th for Rome.\n\nThe stability of the state strongly depended on the number of free and dependent people, so the existing restrictions prevented the emergence of personal debt dependence. The proclamations of Clean States had a purpose to improve the economy, saying: \"In the early 1990s I had tried to write my own summary, but was unable to convince publishers that the Near Eastern tradition of Biblical debt cancellations was firmly grounded. Two decades ago economic historians and even many Biblical scholars thought that the Jubilee Year was merely a literary creation, a utopian escape from practical reality. I encountered a wall of cognitive dissonance at the thought that the practice was attested to in increasingly detailed Clean Slate proclamations\".\n\nAccording to Hudson, instead of a sanctity of debt what was sacred was the regular cancellation of agrarian debts and freeing of bondservants in order to preserve social balance. Such amnesties were not destabilizing, but they were essential to preserving social and economic stability.\n\nFrom the beginning of 2000s, Hudson pays special attention to the issues of inflating fictitious capital, which entails the withdrawal of funds from the real economy and leads to debt deflation. He states finance has been key to guiding politics into reducing the productive capacity of the United States and Europe even as theey benefit from finance methods using similar and expanded techniques to harm Chile, Russia, Latvia and Hungary. Hudson states parasitic finance looks at industry and labor to determine how much wealth it can extract by fees, interest and tax breaks, rather than providing needed capital to increase production and efficiency. He states the magic of compounding interest results in increasing debt that eventually extracts more wealth than production and labor are able to pay. Rather than extracting taxes from the rentiers to reduce the cost of labor and assets and use the tax revenue to improve infrastructure to increase production efficiency, he states the United States tax system, bank bailouts and quantitative easing sacrifice labor and industry for the benefit of the finance sector. According to Hudson, bankers and rentiers as early as 1880s started to search ways to rationalize untaxing and deregulating finance, real estate and monopolies. They succeed in the 1980s with establishing a neoliberal Washington consensus that states \"everyone is worth what they get\" so there is no \"unearned increment\" to be untaxed.\n\nHudson stresses that world victory of neoliberal politics is closely connected with its educational support in all big universities. It is telling that one of the first acts of the Chicago Boys in Chile after the military junta overthrew the Allende government in 1973 was to close down every economics department in the nation outside of the Catholic University, which was a University of Chicago monetarist stronghold. The junta then closed down every social science department and fired, exiled or murdered critics of its ideology in the terrorist Project Condor program waged throughout Latin America and spread to political assassination in the United States itself. What the Chicago Boys recognized is that free market ideology requires totalitarian control of the school and university system, totalitarian control of the press and control of the police where intellectual resistance survives against the idea that economic planning should become much more centralized, but moved out of the hands of government into those of the bankers and other financial institutions, stating: \"Free market ideology ends up as political Doublethink in countering any freedom of thought. Its remarkable success in the United States and elsewhere thus has been achieved largely by excluding the history of economic thought – and of economic history – from the economics curriculum\".\n\nHudson identifies himself as a Marxist economist, but his interpretation of Karl Marx is different from most other Marxists. Whilst other Marxists emphasise upon the contradiction of wage labour and capital as the core issue of today capitalist world, Hudson rejects that idea and believes parasitic forms of finance have warped the political economy of the modern capitalism. Hudson points to Marx' view of capitalism as the historic force that tends to eliminate all forms of pre-capitalist rent seeking, i.e. land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent (usury). The original meaning of a free market as discussed by classical political economists was a market free from all forms of rent. The gist of classical political economy was to distinguish earned and unearned income (also known as rent or free lunch). He then reminds us that unlike Marx' optimistic expectation, history did not go in that direction and today modern capitalism is dominated by rentier classes. The concept of the proletariat as a class for itself presupposes a rent-free society, saying that \"wages have been going no where recently, I hope you've been making a killing on your house price!\". The other form of rent is imperialist rent, flowing from underdeveloped countries to developed ones. All of these forces distort the political economy of the modern capitalism, pushing labour-capital contradiction to the background and bringing other issues to the foreground. This is as if instead of progress, history has regressed back to a neo-feudal system.\n\nAlthough Hudson's views are unpopular amongst other Marxists and sometimes vehemently rejected by them, his views converge with later writings of Marx himself. Hudson quibbles that most Marxists never go beyond \"Capital, Volume I\", where Marx assumes there is a rent-free market where all commodities are sold at their values. That is how Marx deduces the exploitative nature of capitalism and labour-capital dichotomy as its underlying contradiction, but in \"Capital, Volume II\" and \"Capital, Volume III\" he relaxes his assumptions and discovers other contradictions that are much closer to what can be observed in today's economic system. In \"Capital, Volume III\", Marx discusses the tendency of productivity and supply to increase at a faster pace than the consumption power and demand. Marx also revised his earlier ideas as he studied and learned more about the asymmetric development of capitalism. This ultimately led him to soften his revolutionary tone as he realized how dominance of an industrially advanced nations over underdeveloped nations and blocks revolutionary tendencies amongst working classes of dominating nations. On the other side, Marx clashed with Karl Schapper, suggesting that the idea of workers taking over the state power ends up in disaster because they are not ready to practice that power.\n\nHudson is the author of several books, among them the following:\n\nHudson has appeared in several documentaries, including the following:\n\nIn 1984, Hudson joined Harvard's archaeology faculty at the Peabody Museum as a research fellow in Babylonian economics. A decade later, he was a founding member of ISCANEE (International Scholars Conference on Ancient Near Eastern Economies), an international group of Assyriologists and archaeologists that has published a series of colloquia analyzing the economic origins of civilization. This group has become the successor to Karl Polanyi’s anthropological and historical group of a half-century ago. Four volumes co-edited by Hudson have appeared so far, dealing with privatization, urbanization and land use, the origins of money, accounting, debt and clean slates in the ancient Near East (a fifth volume on the evolution of free labor is in progress). This new direction in research is now known as the New Economic Archaeology.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18198410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18198410", "title": "Modern Greek architecture", "text": "Modern Greek architecture\n\nAfter the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans and the following trends of Greek migration to the diaspora, Greek architecture was concentrated mainly on the Greek Orthodox churches of Diaspora. These churches, such as other intellectual centres built by Greeks (foundations, schools, etc.), was used also as a meeting-place. The architectural style of these buildings was heavily influenced by the western European architecture.\n\nAfter the Greek War of Independence and the creation of the modern Greek state, the modern Greek architecture tried to combine the traditional Greek architecture and Greek elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. \n\nThe 19th-century architecture of Athens and other cities of the Greek Kingdom is mostly influenced by the Neoclassical architecture, with architects such as Theophil Hansen, Ernst Ziller, Panagis Kalkos and Stamatios Kleanthis.\n\nThe architecture of the modern Greek cities, especially the old centres (\"old towns\") is mostly influenced either by the Ottoman or the Venetian architecture, two forces that dominated the Greek space from the early modern period.\n\nAfter the Greek Independence, the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. Patras was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan. In January 1829, Stamatis Voulgaris, a Greek engineer of the French army, presented the plan of the new city to the Governor Kapodistrias, who approved it. Voulgaris applied the orthogonal rule in the urban complex of Patras.\n\nTwo special genres can be considered the Cycladic architecture, featuring white-colour houses, in the Cyclades and the Epirotic architecture in the region of Epirus.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, the architecture of Athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the Neoclassical architecture. For Athens, the first King of Greece, Otto of Greece, commissioned the architects Stamatios Kleanthis and Eduard Schaubert to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.\n\nIn 1917 most of Thessaloniki's old center of the city was destroyed by the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917. Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan prepared by a group of architects, including the Briton Thomas Mawson, and headed by French architect Ernest Hébrard.\n\nIn 1933 was signed the Athens Charter, a manifesto of the modernist movement which published later by Le Corbusier. Architects of this movement were among others the Bauhaus-architect Ioannis Despotopoulos, Dimitris Pikionis, Patroklos Karantinos and Takis Zenetos.\n\nIn 1929, two important laws concerning apartment buildings took effect. The law about \"horizontal property\" made it possible that many different owners own one apartment building, each by owning one or more apartment units. Theoretically, each apartment corresponds to a percentage of the original plot. The most important effect of this law was the practice of \"αντιπαροχή\" (\"antiparochì\", literally \"a supply in exchange\"). With \"antiparochi\", the owner of a plot, who can't afford to build an apartment building by himself, makes a contract with a construction company so that the latter will build the apartment building but keep the ownership of as many apartments as the contract states. Although during the interwar period the practice of \"antiparochi\" was limited, as the construction of most apartment buildings was financed solely by the original owners of the plot, \"antiparochi\" became the most common method for financing the construction of condominiums (polykatoikìes) from the 1950s onwards. However this practice had the negative effect of the destruction of many old-era buildings and houses in the major Greek cities, just to be replaced by common appartment buildings.\n\nAfter World War II and the Greek civil war, the massive construction of condominiums in the major Greek city-centres was a major contributory factor for the Greek economy and the post-war recovery. The first scycrapers were also constructed during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the OTE Tower and the Athens Tower Complex.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, \"Xenia\" was a nationwide hotel construction program initiated by the Hellenic Tourism Organisation (Ελληνικός Οργανισμός Τουρισμού, EOT) to improve the country's tourism infrastructure. It constitutes one of the largest infrastructure projects in modern Greek history. The first manager of the project was the architect Charalambos Sfaellos (from 1950 to 1958) and from 1957 the buildings were designed by a team under Aris Konstantinidis.\nFamous foreign architects who have also designed buildings in Greece during the 20th and 21st century, include Walter Gropius, Eero Saarinen and Mario Botta. Several new buildings were also constructed by Santiago Calatrava for the 2004 Athens Olympics, while Bernard Tschumi designed the New Acropolis Museum. Recently in 2012 Renzo Piano designed the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center (completed in 2016).\n\n"}
{"id": "184763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184763", "title": "Málaga", "text": "Málaga\n\nMálaga (, ) is a municipality, capital of the Province of Málaga, in the Autonomous Community of Andalusia, Spain. With a population of 569,130 in 2015, it is the second-most populous city of Andalusia and the sixth-largest in Spain. The southernmost large city in Europe, it lies on the Costa del Sol (\"Coast of the Sun\") of the Mediterranean, about east of the Strait of Gibraltar and about north of Africa.\n\nMálaga's history spans about 2,800 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world. It was founded by the Phoenicians as \"Malaka\" about 770 BC, and from the 6th century BC was under the hegemony of Ancient Carthage. Then, from 218 BC, it was ruled by the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire as \"Malaca\" (Latin). After the fall of the empire and the end of Visigothic rule, it was under Islamic rule as \"Mālaqah\" (مالقة) for 800 years, but in 1487, the Crown of Castille gained control after the Reconquista. The archaeological remains and monuments from the Phoenician, Roman, Arabic and Christian eras make the historic center of the city an \"open museum\", displaying its history of nearly 3,000 years.\n\nThis important cultural infrastructure and the artistic heritage have culminated in the nomination of Málaga as a candidate for the 2016 European Capital of Culture.\n\nThe painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso, Hebrew poet and Jewish philosopher Solomon Ibn Gabirol and the actor Antonio Banderas were born in Málaga. The magnum opus of Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona, \"Malagueña\", is named after the music of this region of Spain.\n\nThe most important business sectors in Málaga are tourism, construction and technology services, but other sectors such as transportation and logistics are beginning to expand. The Andalusia Technology Park (PTA), located in Málaga, has enjoyed significant growth since its inauguration in 1992. Málaga is the main economic and financial centre of southern Spain, home of the region's largest bank, Unicaja, and the fourth-ranking city in economic activity in Spain behind Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia.\n\nThe Phoenicians from Tyre founded the city as Malaka about 770 BC. The name \"Malaḥa\" or \"mlḥ\" is probably derived from the Phoenician word for \"salt\" because fish was salted near the harbour. (Cf. \"salt\" in other Semitic languages, e.g. Hebrew מלח \"mélaḥ\" or Arabic ملح \"malaḥ\").\n\nAfter a period of Carthaginian rule, Malaka became part of the Roman Empire. In its Roman stage, the city (Latin name, Malaca) showed a remarkable degree of development. Transformed into a confederated city, it was under a special law, the \"Lex Flavia Malacitana\". A Roman theatre was built at this time. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it was ruled first by the Visigoths and then by the Byzantine Empire (550–621). . It was regained by the Visigoths in 621 and ruled by them until the Umayyad Muslim conquest in 711.\n\nIn the 8th century, during the Muslim Arabic rule over Spain, the city became an important trade center. Málaga was first a possession of the Caliphate of Córdoba. After the fall of the Umayyad dynasty, it became the capital of a distinct kingdom ruled by the Zirids. During this time, the city was called Mālaqah (Arabic مالقة). From 1025 it was the capital of the autonomous Taifa of Málaga, until its conquest by the Emirate of Granada in 1239.\n\nThe traveller Ibn Battuta, who passed through around 1325, characterised it as \"one of the largest and most beautiful towns of Andalusia [uniting] the conveniences of both sea and land, and is abundantly supplied with foodstuffs and fruits\". He praised its grapes, figs, and almonds; \"its ruby-coloured Murcian pomegranates have no equal in the world.\" Another exported product was its \"excellent gilded pottery\". The town's mosque was large and beautiful, with \"exceptionally tall orange trees\" in its courtyard.\nMálaga was one of the Iberian cities where Muslim rule persisted the longest, having been part of the Emirate of Granada. While most other parts of the peninsula had already been won back during the reconquista, the Moors still occupied Málaga. Málaga was retaken by Christian forces on 18 August 1487, The Muslim inhabitants resisted assaults and artillery bombardments before hunger forced them to surrender, virtually the entire population was sold into slavery or given as \"gifts\" to other Christian rulers, five years before the fall of Granada.\n\nOn 24 August 1704 the indecisive Battle of Málaga, the largest naval battle in the War of the Spanish Succession, took place in the sea south of Málaga.\n\nAfter the coup of July 1936 the government of the Second Spanish Republic retained control of Málaga. Its harbour was a base of the Spanish Republican Navy at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. It suffered heavy bombing by Italian warships which took part in breaking the Republican navy's blockade of Nationalist-held Spanish Morocco and took part in naval bombardment of Republican-held Málaga. After the Battle of Málaga and the Francoist takeover in February 1937, over seven thousand people were killed. The city also suffered shelling later by Spanish Republican naval units. The well-known British journalist and writer Arthur Koestler was captured by the Nationalist forces on their entry into Málaga, which formed the material for his book \"Spanish Testament\". The first chapters of \"Spanish Testament\" include an eye-witness account of the 1937 fall of Málaga to Francisco Franco's armies during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nAfter the war, Málaga and Koestler's old haunts of Torremolinos and the rest of the Costa del Sol enjoyed the highest growth of the tourism sector in Spain.\n\nMálaga is located in southern Spain, on the Costa del Sol (\"Coast of the Sun\") on the northern side of the Mediterranean Sea. It lies at the feet of the Montes de Málaga, about east of the Strait of Gibraltar and about east of Tarifa (the southernmost point of continental Europe) and about to the north of Africa.\n\nThe urban area, stretching mostly along a narrow strip of coastline, has a population of 1,066,532 on (density 1,289 hab / km² – 2012 data). It is formed by Málaga proper together with the following adjacent towns and municipalities: Rincón de la Victoria, Torremolinos, Benalmádena, Fuengirola, Alhaurín de la Torre, Mijas, Marbella and San Pedro Alcántara. The Málaga metropolitan area includes additional municipalities located mostly in the mountains area north of the coast and also some on the coast: Cártama, Pizarra, Coín, Monda, Ojén, Alhaurín el Grande and Estepona on west; Casabermeja on north; Totalán, Algarrobo, Torrox and Vélez-Málaga eastward from Málaga. Municipalities of the metropolitan area are connected by the road network (including motorways) with the urban area and Málaga city (the urban area can be reached by car from the farthest reaches in 20 minutes and Málaga city in 45 minutes). In some usages the metropolitan area includes other municipalities to which Málaga's public transport network extends, at least since the establishment of the (en: \"Consortium of Transportation of Málaga Metropolitan Area\"). Together about 1.3 million (max. 1.6 million) people live in the Málaga metropolitan area and the number grows every year as all the municipalities and cities of the area record an annual increase in population.\n\nThe climate is subtropical-Mediterranean (Köppen climate classification: \"Csa\") with very mild winters and hot summers. Málaga enjoys plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of about 300 days of sunshine and only about 40-45 with precipitation annually. Its coastal location with winds blowing from the Mediterranean Sea make the heat manageable during the summer.<ref name=\"malaga.com/geo\"></ref>\n\nMálaga experiences the warmest winters of any European city with a population over 500,000. The average temperature during the day in the period December through February is . During the winter, the Málaga Mountains (\"Montes de Málaga\") block out the cold weather from the north. Generally, the summer season lasts about eight months, from April to November, although in the remaining four months temperatures sometimes surpass . Its average annual temperature is during the day and at night. In the coldest month, January, the temperature ranges from during the day, at night and the average sea temperature is . In the warmest month, August, the temperature ranges from during the day, above at night and the average sea temperature is .\n\nLarge fluctuations in temperature are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded at the airport is on 18 July 1978. In the month of August 1881, the average reported daytime maximum temperature was a record . The coldest temperature ever recorded was on the night of 4 February 1954. The highest wind speed ever recorded was on 16 July 1980, measuring . Snowfall is virtually unknown; since the end of the XIX century, Málaga city has only recorded snow one day in the 20th century, on 2 February 1954.\n\nAnnual average relative humidity is 65%, ranging from 58% in June to 72% in December. Yearly sunshine hours is between 2,800 and 3,000 per year, from 5–6 hours of sunshine / day in December to average 11 hours of sunshine / day in July. Rain occurs mainly in winter, with summer being generally dry. Málaga is one of the few cities in Europe which are \"green\" all year round. The climate and scenery of Málaga and its surroundings are very similar to Los Angeles, southern California.\n\nThe old historic centre of Málaga reaches the harbour to the south. In the north it is surrounded by mountains, the Montes de Málaga (part of the Baetic Cordillera) lying in the southern base of the Axarquía hills, and two rivers, the Guadalmedina – the historic center is located on its left bank – and the Guadalhorce, which flows west of the city into the Mediterranean, in the Churriana district.\n\nThe oldest architectural remains in the city are the walls of the Phoenician city, which are visible in the cellar of the Museo Picasso Málaga.\n\nThe Roman theatre of Málaga, which dates from the 1st century BC, was rediscovered in 1951.\n\nThe Moors left posterity the dominating presence of the Castle of Gibralfaro, which is connected to the Alcazaba, the lower fortress and royal residence. Both were built during the Taifa period (11th century) and extended during the Nasrid period (13th and 14th centuries). The Alcazaba stands on a hill within the city. Originally, it defended the city from the incursions of pirates. Later, in the 11th century, it was completely rebuilt by the Hammudid dynasty. Occupying the eastern hillside that rises from the sea and overlooks the city, the Alcazaba was surrounded by palms and pine trees.\n\nLike many of the military fortifications that were constructed in Islamic Spain, the Alcazaba of Málaga featured a quadrangular plan. It was protected by an outer and inner wall, both supported by rectangular towers, between which a covered walkway led up the slope to the Gibralfaro (this was the only exchange between the two sites). Due to its rough and awkward hillside topography, corridors throughout the site provided a means of communications for administrative and defensive operations, also affording privacy to the palatial residential quarters.\n\nThe entrance of the complex featured a grand tower that led into a sophisticated double bent entrance. After passing through several gates, open yards with beautiful gardens of pine and eucalyptus trees, and the inner wall through the Puerta de Granada, one finds the 11th- and 14th-century Governor's palace. It was organised around a central rectangular courtyard with a triple-arched gateway and some of the rooms have been preserved to this day. An open 11th-century mirador (belvedere) to the south of this area affords views of the gardens and sea below. Measuring , this small structure highlighted scalloped, five-lobed arches. To the north of this area were a waterwheel and a Cyclopean well (penetrating below ground), a hammam, workshops and the monumental \"Puerta de la Torre del Homenaje\", the northernmost point of the inner walls. Directly beyond was the passage to the Gibralfaro above.\n\nThe (Saint James) is an example of Gothic vernacular Mudéjar, the hybrid style that evolved after the Reconquista incorporating elements from both Christian and Islamic tradition. Also from the period is the \"Iglesia del Sagrario\", which was built on the site of the old mosque immediately after the city fell to Christian troops. It boasts a richly ornamented portal in the Isabeline-Gothic style, unique in the city.\n\nThe Cathedral and the were planned with Renaissance architectural ideals but there was a shortfall of building funds and they were finished in Baroque style.\n\nThe \"\", built in the late 17th century, has a chapel in which the vertical volume is filled with elaborate Baroque plasterwork.\n\nOther sights include:\n\n\n\nIn the early part of the 21st century, the city of Málaga invested heavily (more than 100 million euros in 10 years) in the arts to draw tourists and establish itself as a cultural Andalucia destination with 28 museums. Some notable and recently opened museums are:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013 there were 568,479 people residing in Málaga.\n\nThe number of resident foreign nationals has risen significantly in Málaga since the 1970s, especially of British and German citizens who move for the pleasant climate. The majority of foreigners live near the coastline.\n\nMálaga is divided in 11 municipal districts.\n\nMálaga is the fourth-ranking city in economic activity in Spain behind Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia.\n\nThe most important business sectors in Málaga are tourism, construction and technology services, but other sectors such as transportation and logistics are beginning to expand. The Andalusia Technology Park (PTA) (In Spanish, \"Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía\"), located in Málaga, has enjoyed significant growth since its inauguration in 1992 by the King of Spain. In 2018, this high-tech, science and industrial park employs over 16,774 workers, according to its own numbers.\n\nIn line with the city's strategic plan, the campaign \"Málaga: Open for Business\" is directed towards the international promotion of the city on all levels but fundamentally on a business level. The campaign places a special emphasis on new technologies as well as innovation and research in order to promote the city as a reference and focal point for many global business initiatives and projects.\n\nMálaga is a city of commerce and tourism has been a growing source of revenue, driven by the presence of a major airport, the improvement of communications, and new infrastructure such as the AVE and the maritime station, and new cultural facilities such as the Picasso Museum, the Contemporary Art Centre and Trade Fair and Congress, which have drawn more tourists.\n\nThe city hosts the International Association of Science and Technology Parks (IASP) (\"Asociación Internacional de Parques Tecnológicos\"), and a group of IT company executives and business leaders has launched an information sector initiative, Málaga Valley e-27, which seeks to make Málaga the Silicon Valley of Europe. Málaga has had strong growth in new technology industries, mainly located in the Technological Park of Andalusia, and in the construction sector. The city is home to the largest bank in Andalusia, Unicaja, and such local companies as \"Mayoral\", \"Charanga\", \"Sando\", \"Vera\", \"Ubago\", \"Isofoton\", \"Tedial\", \"Novasoft\", \"Grupo Vértice\" and \"Almeida viajes\", and other multinationals such as Fujitsu Spain, Pernod Ricard Spain, Accenture, Epcos, Oracle Corporation, Huawei and San Miguel. Nobel prize-winner Bruce Beutler is planning to set up the biggest mutagenesis research laboratory in the world in Malaga.\n\nThe Holy Week celebration, the August Málaga Fair (\"Feria de Málaga\") and the Málaga Film Festival are the three major events held in the city.\n\nHoly Week has been observed for five centuries in Málaga. Processions start on Palm Sunday and continue until Easter Sunday. Images depicting scenes from the Passion are displayed on huge ornate \"tronos\" (floats or thrones), some weighing more than . Famous is the royal archbrotherhood of Our-Lady of Hope \"Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza\". They have more than 5,000 members and 600 nazarenos. \nThese \"tronos\" highlight the processions that go through the streets led by penitents dressed in long robes, with capirote, followed by women in black carrying candles. Drums and trumpets play music and occasionally someone spontaneously sings a mournful saeta dedicated to the floats as they make their way slowly round the streets.\nSome Holy Week \"tronos\" are so huge that they must be housed in places outside the churches, as they are taller than the entrance doors. Famous is the military procession of \"la legion\" (Royal congregation of Mena) playing marches and singing their anthem (El Novio de la Muerte) during procession.\n\nDuring the celebration of the \"Feria de Málaga\" in August, the streets are transformed into traditional symbols of Spanish culture and history, with sweet wine, tapas, and live flamenco shows. The day events consist of dancing, live music (like Flamenco or \"Verdiales\", traditional music from Málaga) and bullfights at \"La Malagueta\", while the night fair is moved to the Recinto Ferial, consisting of restaurants, clubs, and an entire fair ground with rides and games.\n\nThe Málaga Film Festival (\"Festival de Málaga Cine Español (FMCE)\"), dedicated exclusively to films produced in Spain, is one of the most important festivals in the country. It is held annually during a week in March or April.\n\nMost of the population of Málaga professes Roman Catholicism as its religion, although not many are practising Catholics. Protestants also have a presence in Málaga: one of seven congregations of the Reformed Churches in Spain is based in the city and is the only one that permits paedocommunion, while The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is growing.\n\nIslam is represented by a growing number of immigrants and a mosque, while the Jewish community (primarily Sephardi) is represented by its synagogue and the Jewish Association.\n\nMálaga is home to three major professional sports teams. These include:\n\nThe city has four large sports facilities:\n\nIn city and neighbourhood, you can engage in many sports, for example: surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, swimming, diving, skydiving, paragliding, running, cycling, rowing, tennis and golf.\nThe city will host the 21st World Transplant Games from 25 June to 2 July 2017 \n\nThe city is an important tourist destination, known as \"the capital of the Costa del Sol\". An estimated 6 million tourists visit the city each year. Tourists usually visit the birthplace of Pablo Picasso and the Museo Picasso Málaga, the Carmen Thyssen Museum, the old town or the beaches. The Málaga harbour is also the second busiest cruise port of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nA popular walk leads up the hill to the Gibralfaro castle (a Parador), offering panoramic views over the city. The castle is next to the Alcazaba, the old Muslim palace, which in turn is next to the inner city of Málaga. Other nearby attractions are the Roman Theatre, the old Jewish quarter, the Cathedral, and the Church of Santiago in mudéjar style. A popular walk follows the \"Paseo del Parque\" (a promenade that runs alongside a grand park with many palm trees and statues) to the harbour, ending in \"Calle Larios\", the main commercial street of the city. There is also a curious museum, the Museum of the Holy Week, which includes an impressive display of Baroque ecclesiastical items.\n\nThe \"Fiesta Mayor de Verdiales\" takes place every year on 28 December during which Spain's April Fool Day is celebrated.\n\nThe \"Fiestas de Carnaval\", in which people dress in all types of costumes, takes place prior to the holy 40 days of Lent every February. A contest is held in the \"Teatro Cervantes\" between groups of singers, quartets and choirs who compete in the singing of ironic songs about social and political issues. The Carnival takes to the streets of Málaga on the week before Ash Wednesday, ending on Malagueta beach with the burial of the anchovy (\"entierro de la sardina\").\n\nSince the launch of the ‘Plan de Fomento del Plurilingüismo’ in 2005, 169 schools in Malaga have included bilingual education in their programmes. Although English is the most usual second language, many other primary and secondary schools in Malaga offer the choice of French, German, Arab, Portuguese or Chinese. This first action has been followed by a second project run by the Junta de Andalucia. The so-called “Plan Estrategico de Desarrollo de las Lenguas en Andalucia” intends to provide pupils with a basic level (B1) of at least one foreign language.\n\nDance, music, drama, visual arts and crafts also have a place in the public education system of Málaga. Some of the most relevant artistic schools are:\n\nMalaga has become one of the leading destinations for Spanish courses. Only in 2017, 16,692 students visited Malaga to enroll in Spanish courses, 17,6% more than 2016.\n\nThe public University of Malaga (UMA) has its campus in the Western neighbourhood of Teatinos. There are 13 different faculties, namely:\n\n\nand 5 higher technical schools:\n\n\n\nThe city is served by Málaga Costa Del Sol Airport, one of the first in Spain and the oldest still in operation. In 2008, it handled 12,813,472 passengers, making it the fourth-busiest in Spain. It is the international airport of Andalusia, accounting for 85 percent of its international traffic.\nThe airport, connected to the Costa del Sol, has a daily link with twenty cities in Spain and over a hundred cities in Europe (mainly in United Kingdom, Central Europe and the Nordic countries but also the main cities of Eastern Europe: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Budapest, Sofia, Warsaw or Bucharest), North Africa, Middle East (Riyadh, Jeddah and Kuwait) and North America (New York City, Toronto and Montreal).\n\nThe airport is connected to Málaga City and surrounding areas through a transport hub, which includes the bus system and suburban trains and car parks.\n\nThe Port of Málaga is the city's seaport, operating continuously at least since 600 BC. The port is one of the busiest ports on the Mediterranean Sea, with a trade volume of over 428,623 TEU and 642,529 passenger in 2008.\n\nThe Málaga María Zambrano railway station is served by the AVE high-speed rail system, and is operated by the Spanish formerly state-owned rail company Renfe.\n\nThe A45 road leads north to Antequera and Córdoba.\nThe Autovía A-7 parallels the N-340 road, both leading to Cádiz to the west through the Costa del Sol Occidental and Barcelona to the east through the Costa del Sol Oriental.\n\nEmpresa Malagueña de Transportes buses are the main form of transport around the city. Málaga's bus station is connected with the city by the bus line number 4, although it is only ten minutes' walk to the Alameda from there.\n\nMálaga Metropolitan Transport Consortium's (Consorcio de Transporte Metropolitano del Área de Málaga) buses are the main form of transport around the city of Málaga and the villages of the Metropolitan Area.\n\nThe city has two commuter train lines Cercanías and a light rail system.\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Malaga, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 49 min. 6% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 9 min, while 8% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.1 km, while 1% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\nMálaga is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

He had two brothers and two sisters. The eldest brother died while very young. The second, Ban Mueang, became king following their father's death, and was succeeded by Ram Khamhaeng on his own death.\n\nAt age 19, Prince Ram Khamhaeng participated in his father's successful invasion of the city of Sukhothai, formerly a vassal of the Khmer, establishing the independent Sukhothai Kingdom. Due to his courage in the war, he allegedly was given the title \"Phra Rama Khamhaeng\" or Rama the Strong, though he is recorded in the Ayyutthaya Chronicles as King \"Ramaraj\". After his father's death, his brother Ban Muang ruled the kingdom, assigning Prince Ram Khamhaeng control of the city of Si Sat Chanalai.\n\nThe Royal Institute of Thailand speculates that Prince Ram Khamhaeng's birth name was \"Ram\" (derived from the name of the Hindu epic Ramayana's hero Rama), for his name following his coronation was \"Pho Khun Ramarat\" (). Furthermore, the tradition at the time was to give the name of a grandfather to a grandson; according to the 11th Stone Inscription and Luang Prasoet Aksoranit's Ayutthaya Chronicles, Ram Khamhaeng had a grandson named \"Phraya Ram\", and two grandsons of Phraya Ram were named \"Phraya Ban Muang\" and \"Phraya Ram\".\n\nTri Amattayakun (), The Thai historian suggests that Ram Khamhaeng should have acceded to the throne in 1279, the year he planted a sugar palm tree in Sukhothai City. Prasert na Nagara of the Royal Institute speculates that this was in a tradition of Thai-Ahom's monarchs, who planted banyan or sugar palm trees on their coronation day in the hope that their reign would achieve the same stature as the tree. The most significant event at the beginning of his reign, however, was the elopement of one of his daughters with the captain of the palace guards, a commoner who founded the Ramanya Kingdom and commissioned compilation of the Code of Wareru, which provided a basis for the law of Thailand used in Siam until 1908, and in Burma to the present.\n\nRam Khamhaeng sent embassies to the Yuan China from 1282 to 1323 and imported the techniques to make the ceramics now known as Sangkhalok ceramic ware. He had close relationships with the rulers of nearby city-states, especially Ngam Muang, the ruler of neighboring Phayao (whose wife, according to legend, he seduced), and King Mangrai of Chiang Mai. According to current Thai national history, Ram Khamhaeng expanded his kingdom as far as Lampang, Phrae, and Nan in the north, and Phitsanulok and Vientiane in the east, the Mon kingdoms of what is now Myanmar in the west, the Bay of Bengal in the northwest, and the Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom in the south. \n\nHowever, in the mandala political model, as historian Thongchai Winichakul notes, kingdoms such as Sukhothai lacked distinct borders, instead being centered on the strength of the capital itself. Claims of Ram Khamhaeng's large kingdom were, according to Thongchai, intended to assert Siamese dominance over mainland Southeast Asia. His campaign against Cambodia left the Khmer country \"utterly devastated.\" \n\nAccording to Thai history, Ram Khamhaeng developed the Thai alphabet (\"Lai Sue Thai\") from Sanskrit, Pali, and the Grantha alphabet.\n\nAccording to the Chinese \"History of Yuan\", King Ram Khamhaeng died by 1299 and was succeeded by his son, Loe Thai, though George Cœdès thinks it \"more probable\" it was \"shortly before 1318\". Legend states he disappeared in the rapids of the rivers of Sawankhalok.\n\nMuch of the traditional biographical information comes from the inscription on the Ram Khamhaeng stele, composed in 1292, and now in the Bangkok National Museum. The formal name of the stele is the \"King Ram Khamhaeng Inscription\". It was added to the Memory of the World Register in 2003 by UNESCO.\n\nKing Ram Khamhaeng is credited with bringing the skills of ceramic making from China and laying the foundation of a strong ceramic ware industry in the Sukhothai Kingdom. Sukhothai for centuries was the major exporter of the ceramics known as \"Sangkhalok ware ()\" to countries such as Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and even to China. The industry was one of the main revenue generators during his reign and long afterwards.\n\nThe reverse of 20 Baht note(series 16), issued in 2013, depicts images of the royal statue of King Ramkhamhaeng the Great seated on the Manangkhasila Asana Throne, as well as the invention of the Thai script to commemorate King Ramhamhaeng.\n\nRamkhamhaeng University, the first open university in Thailand with campuses throughout the country, was named after King Ram Khamhaeng the Great.\n\nKing Ram Khamhaeng is a playable ruler for the Siamese in \"Civilization V\".\n\n\n"}

Not a Fascist himself, D'Amico was the major theater critic during the \"ventennio\", the twenty years (1922-1945) of Fascist rule in Italy. He was the first editor of the nine volume \"Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo\" (\"Encyclopedia of Performing Arts\"), published between 1954 and 1965, that covered theater, music, cinema, and dance. Most notably, he held an eminent position in theatrical study in Italy, giving his name to the Silvio D'Amico National Academy of Dramatic Art in Rome, Italy's most prestigious drama school.\n\nA Catholic, D'Amico was educated by Jesuits at Rome's Massimiliano Massimo Institute. After graduating in law in 1911, he was appointed to the Ministry of Education to the Directorate General for Antiquities and Fine Arts. In 1923, he became professor of theater history in the Royal School of Acting \"Eleonora Duse.\" He met Duse when he was young and ambitious, a time when D'Amico wanted to create an Italian national theatre that produced works of young Italian playwrights.\n\nBetween 1925 and 1940, he directed dramatic criticism in the \"La Tribune\" newspaper. With Nicola De Pirro, he founded the magazine \"Scenario\" in 1932 and they directed it together for three years, after which De Pirro continued alone.

{"id": "35178588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35178588", "title": "Suffrage drama", "text": "Suffrage drama\n\nSuffrage drama (also known as Suffrage Plays or Suffrage theatre) is a form of dramatic literature that emerged during the British women’s suffrage movement in the early twentieth century. Suffrage performances lasted approximately from 1907-1914. Many suffrage plays called for a predominant or all female cast. Suffrage plays served to reveal issues behind the suffrage movement. These plays also revealed many of the double standards that women faced on a daily basis. Suffrage theatre was a form of realist theatre, which was influenced by the plays of Henrik Ibsen. Suffrage theatre combined familiar everyday situations with relatable characters on the stage in the style of realist theatre.\n\nSuffrage dramas in favor of women's suffrage often portray strong female characters who illustrate the qualities of a rational, informed voters. They are meant to imply the obsolescence and inaccuracy of gender stereotypes that justified denying women the vote, such as separate spheres philosophy. Such characters often convince male or female anti-suffragists to revise their beliefs and support women's suffrage. Other plays satirize anti-suffragists as buffoons or narrow-minded individuals opposing progress. Many of these plays deliberately required few props and no sets. This was to allow amateur acting companies to perform the dramas at minimal cost, allowing them to be more widely performed and spread pro-suffrage sentiment. Due to the low cost of organizing a performance, suffrage plays were often performed in the drawing rooms of private residences and in small professional theaters.\n\nDuring the suffrage movement in the United Kingdom, eighteen short plays were published that have been coined women’s suffrage drama but these represent only a few of the numerous plays with suffrage themes, the majority written in support of the Cause, that have been identified. Susan Croft's 'Chronology of Plays addressing or supporting Suffrage Issues 1907-1914' lists 170 , a figure further supplemented by additional plays, discovered since publication, listed online. Elizabeth Robins’s \"Votes for Women\" and Cicely Hamilton and Christopher St. John’s \"How the Vote Was Won\" are two predominant examples of suffrage plays. Elizabeth Robins’s \"Votes for Women\" was one of the first published women’s suffrage plays. It was performed in 1907 at the Court Theatre in London. Julie Holledge, British actor and director, wrote that \"Votes for Women\" “heralded the beginning of a suffrage theatre” and assisted in organizing actresses and “their involvement with the women’s rights movement and their dissatisfaction with a male dominated theatre, these women had begun to develop a drama that could express the reality of women’s lives...With the emergence of the mass suffrage movement in the Edwardian era, over a thousand actresses were thrust into the fight for votes for women. Out of their struggle the first ‘women’s theatre movement of the twentieth century was born.” \n\nThe characters in these plays were realistic, middle class characters fighting for or against women’s suffrage. These plays often featured female characters talking with each other about the suffrage movement and often broke the boundaries between class. Suffrage plays led to the 1908 formation of the Actresses' Franchise League that “provided the infrastructure to promote women’s endeavors on a large scale.” \n\nSuffragists used plays to create changes in social attitudes. Attending a play was a social and community event, therefore their message reached a large audience in a short period of time. Some suffragists would say, “a change in legislation was attributed to the production of one play.” Suffrage plays were a source of optimism for the female suffrage movement. Suffrage theatre gave prominence to women’s roles and issues for the first time and greatly influenced the women’s suffrage movement.\n\nTheatre played a crucial role in the United Kingdom women's suffrage movement. Pro-suffrage acting organizations such as The Actresses' Franchise League and Edith Craig's Pioneer Players formed alongside more political entities like the National Society for Women's Suffrage to campaign for the vote using drama and lectures. Only actresses were permitted to join the Actresses Franchise League. However, the AFL vowed to \"assist all other [women's suffrage] Leagues wherever possible\" by creating and performing \"propaganda plays\" and hosting informative lectures on the subject. The United Kingdom was home to many of the premiere suffragist playwrights, including Cicely Hamilton (author of \"Diana of Dobson's\"), George Bernard Shaw (\"Press Cuttings\"), Beatrice Harraden (\"Lady Geraldine's Speech\") and Bessie Hatton (\"Before Sunrise\"). Contemporary plays concerning the women's suffrage movement continue to be written and performed in Britain, such as Ian Flint's \"Woman\" (2003), Rebecca Lenkiewicz's \"Her Naked Skin\" (2008) and Sally Sheringham's \"The Sound of Breaking Glass\" (2009). \n\nBritish suffrage organizations and magazines also showed an interest in the position of women in India and suffrage performance in Britain included tableaux by Indian women, performed in Sloane Square, while \"Votes for Women\" reviewed plays like Tagore's \"Chitra\".\n\nAlthough many suffrage dramas were written by British authors and playwrights, a number of American writers contributed to the overall body of pro-suffrage plays. Many of these authors were well known in their own right: Charlotte Perkins Gilman authored the recently re-published \"Three Women\", \"Something to Vote For\", T\"he Ceaseless Struggle of Sex\": \"A Dramatic View\", and the suffragist/World War I correspondent Inez Milholland composed \"If Women Voted\". Organizations such as the National American Woman Suffrage Association viewed theatre as an effective way to spread pro-suffrage sentiment and provided suffrage dramas to professional and amateur theatres. Other American dramatists who contributed to the genre include Miriam Nicholson, Elizabeth Gerberding, Salina Solomon and Mrs. Charles Caffin. Unfortunately many of the suffrage dramas circulated by the NAWSA have been lost, and the only evidence of their existence has been found in surviving order pamphlets for the plays.\n\nSome of the earliest plays to address the question of women's suffrage were written in opposition to extending the vote. These plays satirized the notion of revised (and more equal) gender roles by portraying women as incapable of influence afforded to men or characterizing suffragists as \"unwomanly\" grotesques. Little research has been done into the prevalence or popularity of these anti-suffrage plays. One notable example that transitioned from small parlor performances (like the pro-suffrage plays performed by amateur actors) to widespread popularity in the United States is \"The Spirit of Seventy-Six; or, The Coming Woman, A Prophetic Drama\" (1868) by Ariana Randolph Wormeley Curtis and Daniel Sargent Curtis. The play was written following the Civil War, as many abolitionists were beginning to shift their focus to different social issues, such as women's suffrage. The play is meant to be an absurdest fantasy depicting what life would be like if women and men traded gender roles. For example, women in the play wear men's clothing, smoke cigars, and hold all political offices while men struggle to tend to children in the home. The play implies that by enfranchising women they will all become horribly masculine, and suggests that radical suffrage activists campaign to \"cover their own undesirability or incompetence\".\n\n\nThe Methuen Drama Book of Suffrage Plays - published 2013 - http://www.naomipaxton.co.uk/the-methuen-drama-book-of-suffrage-plays.html\nVotes for Women and Other Plays - published 2009 - http://aurorametro.com/newsite/products-page/play-collections/votes-for-women/\n\n"}

The incident occurred just four days after riots in the Aboriginal community of Palm Island, off the north Queensland coast, over the suspicious death of an Aboriginal man in police custody.\n\nThe local Aboriginal community was outraged when the Tomkins were handed down a A$500 fine each for their treatment of the four boys, who themselves were charged with break, enter and steal. The event made headlines in countries around the world, including the UK.\n\nOn November 2004, four Indigenous boys from the Toomelah Aboriginal Mission swam across the Macintyre River to a nearby Queensland property managed by David Hilary Tomkins (then 44 years old) and his son Clint Williams Tomkins (then 23 years old). The four boys, Alan Boland (16), Bevan \"BJ\" Bartman (19), Reg McGrady (23) and Jade, had said that they had previously bought marijuana from the Tomkins but had recently begun stealing it from the property instead.\n\nThe four boys broke into a building with the intention of stealing from a hydroponic crop inside, but were discovered by the Tomkins. McGrady and Jade escaped to the other side of the river, but the other two, Bartman and Boland, were caught by the Tomkins. \n\nBartman and Boland allege that the Tomkins pulled Boland back through the river, stripped him naked, bound his wrists and then dragged him up an embankment by a rope tied around his neck. They also allege the Tomkins tied Bartman to a tree and forced him to watch as they threatened to cut off Boland's toes with a pair of pliers and beat them both with sticks.\n\nBartman has said he managed to escape after he faked an asthma attack while he was being untied from the tree. He then ran back through the bush and swam across the river. Boland said the two Tomkins then walked into the farmhouse and returned with a double-barrelled shotgun and 0.22-calibre rifle, loaded both in front of Boland and pressed the guns to either side of his temples, yelled racist taunts and hammered the boy's face with their gun butts. The Tomkins called the police and allegedly removed the noose from Boland's neck before they arrived. The police took Boland to Goondiwindi police station and charged him with break and enter.\n\nBoland's family have said the police questioned Boland for three hours until legal representation from Legal Aid arrived. The representative allegedly said that Boland was in no condition to give a statement, and ordered the boy be taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries, which he considered were extremely severe. \n\nBoland's family have said Boland's face was bruised and swollen, he had suffered several cuts on his body from being dragged around and had rope burns around his neck. Boland's family have said Boland was still in shock and vomited repeatedly on the way to the hospital. \n\nAt the local Goondiwindi hospital a nurse attended Boland, but the doctor on duty refused to see him, despite the gravity of his injuries, according to Boland's family. At one stage Boland and one of the Tomkins, who had broken his arm in the fracas, were sitting together in the same treatment room. Boland was then taken by the police to a holding cell in Tenterfield.\n\nThe court case was held on 18 May 2005. At 9.30 am, two hours before the case, the police prosecutor told Boland's mother Rosalyn, Toomelah elder Ada Jarrett and a Toowoomba Legal Aid representative that the Tomkins would only get a fine or a good behaviour bond, according to Mrs Boland and Jarrett.\n\nAccording to Jarrett and Mrs Boland, a police sergeant and the prosecutor then repeatedly pressured them for another two hours to sign statements dropping the more serious charge of assault occasioning bodily harm in company, for which there is a maximum penalty of 10 years' jail. The sergeant and prosecutor claimed the Tomkins would walk free if Boland didn't arrive at the courthouse on time, said Jarrett and Mrs Boland.\n\nA large number of indigenous relatives and residents from Toomelah, Boggabilla and Moree had turned up to witness the court's proceedings, as had \"Sugar\" Ray Robinson, former deputy chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Local Aboriginal leader Bert Button said the charge of assault causing bodily harm in company was an outrage. He demanded the two men be given murder charges. \n\nAt the hearing, held before magistrate Dennis Beutel, the Tomkins pleaded guilty to common assault. The prosecutor representing the four Toomelah boys did not produce photographs of the boys' injuries nor use their testimonies, according to Jarrett. The prosecutor also failed to mention the drugs on the Tomkins' property.\n\nThe UK's Daily Telegraph reported that the Tomkins' defence lawyer, Robbie Davis, had said his clients had become fed up with frequent break-ins on the farm and that they had used \"reasonable force\" to restrain Boland. Davis said the Tomkins were wrong to tie a noose around Boland's neck. \"It's a pity they didn't have the hindsight [sic] to put a rope around his waist and not his neck,\" he told the court. \"This is not a racial event. It would have been the same if it had been a white youth.\" The Tomkins were fined A$500 each, and ordered to pay A$300 each to the victim. For a common assault charge, up to three years imprisonment is possible.\n\nOutside the court house, the victims' relatives were outraged and began yelling abuse at the police and the Tomkins, who were led out under heavy police guard. Protesters waved placards declaring \"One law for whites and one law for blacks – still\" and \"This is KKK land\". The police had already called in a number of extra squad cars and reinforcements, including a SWAT team that was stationed around the courthouse.\n\nATSIC's Robinson called on Queensland Premier Peter Beattie to investigate the case and the actions of the police. Local leader Bert Button said, \"The justice system stinks. It's saying it's all right for non-Indigenous people to go and put a rope around someone's neck and drag them up and down a river and give them a flogging.\" The Tomkins spent the night under police protection.\n\nThere was no appeal brought against the criminal case decision by the victims. \n\nAfter the guilty verdict David Tomkins told the Seven Network that he would do it again if confronted with the same situation. He said it was the third time in two years that his home had been broken into, and that he only wanted to detain Boland, according to an AAP report. \"My proud home keeps getting broken into and robbed,\" said Tomkins. \"All I did was detain one of the criminals for the police.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "14357997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14357997", "title": "Traditional trades", "text": "Traditional trades\n\nTraditional trades (known also as traditional building trades and preservation trades) is a loosely defined categorization of building trades who actively practice their craft in respect of historic preservation, heritage conservation, or the conserving and maintenance of the existing built environment. Though traditional trade practitioners may at times be involved in new construction, the emphasis of the categorization is toward work on existing structures, regardless of their age or their historic value, with a specific interest in replication or conservation of the original results and craft techniques.\n\nTraditional building trades commonly include masonry, timber framing, log building, traditional roofing, carpentry and joinery, plasterwork, painting, blacksmithing, and ornamental metal working. In addition to \"hands-on\" skills and knowledge of building processes, traditional trade practitioners incorporate knowledge of historic preservation, materials science, historic architecture, and procuring replacement materials. Contemporary practitioners of traditional trades must also avail themselves of modern technologies, current materials science, and 21st century construction project management.\n\nThe work performed by these practitioners is not only essential to the maintenance of the historic built environment, but also to the preservation of the traditional trade skills and knowledge themselves. In many cases, traditional trade skills and techniques date back centuries. Traditional trades such as carpenters and timber framers; masons, plasterers, lime burners, and brick makers; painters; blacksmiths; and slate, metal, shingle, tile, and thatch roofers, are anecdotally said to be “dying” arts. While it is true that some techniques of the past are not well enough understood, it is also true that these crafts have been practiced continuously all over the world without dying at all.\n\nTraditional trades not only restore and help to maintain buildings, but also stabilize priceless archaeological sites, and in doing so, help us understand the techniques used at places like Cuzco, Stonehenge, and Angkor Wat. Such trades are not solely practiced for the conservation of monumental heritage sites and can be applied to conserve vernacular sites such as barns.\n\nThe traditional trades focus on preservation of the knowledge of craft work specific to historic building technologies and traditional/non-traditional building materials. Traditional building materials and traditional trade technologies are commonly associated with a host of materials, but not limited to, stone, brick, terra cotta, adobe, cork, leather, timber and log, bamboo, thatch, slate and metal roofing, fine and vernacular carpentry, ornamental plaster (scagliola), stained glass, window and door restoration, wood refinishing, painting, cast iron and wrought iron. In what may at times be considered non-traditional materials are found trades such as chandelier and lighting restoration where you have to be somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades with an understanding of electricity, and knowledgeable with properties and finishes of metals, glass, and optics. As an example of the mix of new and old materials, the art of restoration of mobile residential trailers requires a number of traditional trade skills associated with traditional and contemporary materials in a manner not dissimilar to those hand-work skills and preservation approaches required to restore an historic automobile, a biplane, rocket ship or steam locomotive.\n\nTraditional building technologies tend towards a closer relationship of the built environment to an in-practice understanding, interaction and use of natural resources and recycled or salvaged building materials than is common in the practice of modern and contemporary building technologies.\n\nFor example: a traditional timber framer in search of difficult-to-acquire materials with which to rebuild heritage structures will tend to seek out an understanding of forest management, tree harvest, conversion process and building design and technique. These integrated skills and their supportive knowledge base both in scale and localization are readily adaptable to strategies of sustainable new-build economies.\n\nOld buildings and structures were built once, energy and natural resources previously expended, and to adaptively re-use or recycle them often requires an understanding and appreciation of not only how the older materials with which they were built work together in a structure, but a need to understand the techniques by which these materials were originally worked, and an understanding of how they can most optimally be worked now.\n\nAs opposed to an emphasis on materials science (as with an architectural conservator) the primary orientation of a traditional trade practitioner tends toward the in-process work activity and physical interaction and intervention with the building materials and the coordination, education and project management of in-field work teams.\n\nTraditional trades are quite often team members with architectural conservators, preservation architects and structural engineers in both the design phase investigation of heritage sites as well as involved directly in the undertaking of the hands-on restoration process. Traditional trades as a resource to the historic preservation industry provide a physical grounding in feasibility, construction logic, field and site logistics, reference to skilled traditional trades practitioners, estimate and budget considerations.\n\nSkilled traditional trades practitioners are generally available to preservationists and property stewards who give themselves a chance to find them. Besides the Internet and verbal networking, information about traditional trades can be found through trade associations and training programs, both private and governmental. If a particular job is limited to union workers, the union should provide workers with the appropriate skills or else allow an exception for a particular task.\n\nA traditional trades practitioner may also be able to recommend experts in related skills, as well as promote good communications among the different disciplines at work on any given project.\n\nBasic levels of training in contemporary building and craft skills are a prerequisite to specialization in traditional trades work. Individuals with an interest in learning a traditional trade can seek out learning opportunities either through formal vocational programs or through informal mentorship in at-work field practice under the tutelage of a traditional trade practitioner.\n\nFamily businesses, trade unions, historic preservation businesses, government programs (National Park Service Historic Preservation Training Center), college programs, religious and non-profit organizations are areas where an interest to provide education of traditional trade practice can often be found. As the individual increases in skill, learning will come from study, from workshops, from travel and personal contacts, and from clues found in the work itself.\n\nSome individual tradespeople provide training opportunities for their fellow tradespeople without a close association with the larger educational institutions.\n\nIndividuals providing trades training include:\n\nJohn Leeke's Historic HomeWorks\n\nSteve Quillian, Historic Homes Workshop\n\nAmy McAuley, Oculus, oculuswindow (at) gmail.com\n\nKelsie Gray, kelsiegray (at) gmail.com\nInstitutions providing trades education programs include:\n\nThe Preservation Education Institute\n\nBelmont Tech\n\nCollege of the Redwoods\n\nSavannah College of Art & Design\n\nAmerican College of the Building Arts\n\nNorth Bennet Street School\n\nPine Mountain Settlement School\n\nOrganizations providing trades education resources, and hands-on workshops include:\n\nPreservation Trades Network\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "650704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=650704", "title": "Whiteness studies", "text": "Whiteness studies\n\nWhiteness studies is an interdisciplinary arena of inquiry that has developed beginning in the United States, particularly since the late 20th century, and is focused on what proponents describe as the cultural, historical and sociological aspects of people identified as white, and the social construction of \"whiteness\" as an ideology tied to social status. Pioneers in the field include W. E. B. Du Bois (\"Jefferson Davis as a Representative of Civilization\", 1890; \"Darkwater\", 1920), James Baldwin (\"The Fire Next Time\", 1963), Theodore W. Allen (\"The Invention of the White Race,\" 1976, expanded in 1995), Ruth Frankenberg (\"White Women, Race Matters: The Social Construction of Whiteness\", 1993), author and literary critic Toni Morrison (\"Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination\", 1992) and historian David Roediger (\"The Wages of Whiteness\", 1991). By the mid-1990s, numerous works across many disciplines analyzed whiteness, and it has since become a topic for academic courses, research and anthologies.\n\nA central tenet of whiteness studies is a reading of history and its effects on the present that is inspired by postmodernism and historicism, in which the very concept of racial superiority is said to have been socially constructed in order to justify discrimination against non-whites. Since the 19th century, some writers have argued that the phenotypical significances attributed to specific races are without biological association, and that race is therefore not a valid biological concept. Many scientists have demonstrated that racial theories are based upon an arbitrary clustering of phenotypical categories and customs, and can overlook the problem of gradations between categories. Thomas K. Nakayama and Robert L. Krizek write about whiteness as a \"strategic rhetoric,\" asserting, in the essay \"Whiteness: A Strategic Rhetoric\", that whiteness is a product of \"discursive formation\" and a \"rhetorical construction\". Nakayama and Krizek write, \"there is no 'true essence' to 'whiteness': there are only historically contingent constructions of that social location.\" Nakayama and Krizek also suggest that by naming whiteness, one calls out its centrality and reveals its invisible, central position. Whiteness is considered normal and neutral, therefore, to name whiteness means that one identifies whiteness as a rhetorical construction which can be dissected to unearth its values and beliefs.\n\nMajor areas of research in whiteness studies include the nature of white privilege and white identity, the historical process by which a white racial identity was created, the relation of culture to white identity, and possible processes of social change as they affect white identity.\n\nStudies of whiteness as a unique identity could be said to begin among black people, who needed to understand whiteness to survive, particularly in slave societies such as the American colonies and United States. An important theme in this literature is, beyond the general \"invisibility\" of blacks to whites, the unwillingness of white people to consider that black people study them anthropologically. American author James Weldon Johnson wrote in his 1912 novel \"The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man\" that \"colored people of this country know and understand the white people better than the white people know and understand them\". Author James Baldwin wrote and spoke extensively about whiteness, defining it as a central social problem and insisting that it was choice, not a biological identity. In \"The Fire Next Time\" (1963), a non-fiction book on race relations in the United States, Baldwin suggests that \n\"White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this—which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never—the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed.\"A major black theory of whiteness connects this identity group with acts of terrorism—i.e., slavery, rape, torture, and lynching—against black people, who were treated as sub-human.\n\nWhite academics in the United States and the United Kingdom (UK) began to study whiteness as early as 1983, creating the idea of a discipline called \"whiteness studies\". The \"canon wars\" of the late 1980s and 1990s, a political controversy over the centrality of white authors and perspectives in United States culture, led the scholar Shelley Fisher Fishkin to ask \"how the imaginative construction of 'whiteness' had shaped American literature and American history\". The field developed a large body of work during the early 1990s, Fishkin describes it extending across the disciplines of \"literary criticism, history, cultural studies, sociology, anthropology, popular culture, communication studies, music history, art history, dance history, humor studies, philosophy, linguistics, and folklore\".\n\nAs of 2004, according to \"The Washington Post\", at least 30 institutions in the United States including Princeton University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of New Mexico and University of Massachusetts Amherst offer, or have offered, courses in whiteness studies. Teaching and research around whiteness often overlap with research on post-colonial theory and orientalism taking place in the Arts and Humanities, Sociology, Literature, Communications, and Cultural and Media Studies faculties and departments, among others (e.g. Kent, Leeds). Also heavily engaged in whiteness studies are practitioners of anti-racist education, such as Betita Martinez and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop.\n\nOne contribution to White Studies is Rich Benjamin's \"Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America\". The book examines white social beliefs and white anxiety in the contemporary United States—in the context of enormous demographic, cultural, and social change. The book is often taught as a primer in White Studies on white racial identity in a \"post-racial\" US.\n\nAnother major contribution to whiteness studies is the analysis of whiteness as a phenomenon, not just localized to the US and Western Hemisphere, but also in the context of other post-colonial metropoles such as the Netherlands. Gloria Wekker’s White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race excavates the immutability and fluidity of white identity and its relationship to innocence in the context of post-colonial Netherlands in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Wekker identifies white innocence as a contemporary construction and denial [aggressive national forgetting] of the Netherlands role and proximity to European imperialism, racial stratification and hierarchy, and its contributions to the making of contemporary constructions of national belonging and cultural normativity (autochtoon vs. allochtonen).\n\nIn Wekker’s analysis, although a majority of the residents of the Netherlands are migrants, the process of stratifying Dutch from “Other” is facilitated through skin tone and non-Christian religious practices (“deviant”, non-White religions). In Wekker’s account, the process of racialization is reserved for mid-to-late twentieth century migrant groups [i.e. Muslims, Black Surinamese, Black Antilleans], interchangeably as a means of delineating groups outside the constructed immutable “norms” of Dutch society. Ultimately, Wekker is illuminating the cultural and rhetorical maneuvering that occurs within Dutch popular culture, educational spaces, and national discourses that facilitate a normalizing, non-identity to whiteness and how this very concept is intricately connected to a longer historical nineteenth-century racial grammar that accompanied imperial expansion.\n\nWhiteness studies draws on research into the definition of race, originating with the United States but applying to racial stratification worldwide. This research emphasizes the historically recent social construction of white identity. As stated by W. E. B. Du Bois in 1920: \"The discovery of a personal whiteness among the world's peoples is a very modern thing,—a nineteenth and twentieth century matter, indeed.\" The discipline examines how white, Native, and African/black identities emerged in interaction with the institutions of slavery, colonial settlement, citizenship, and industrial labor. Scholars such as Winthrop Jordan have traced the evolution of the legally defined line between \"blacks\" and \"whites\" to colonial government efforts to prevent cross-racial revolts among unpaid laborers.\n\nAcademic Joseph Pugliese is among writers who have applied whiteness studies to an Australian context, discussing the ways that Indigenous Australians were marginalized in the wake of British colonization of Australia, as whiteness came to be defined as central to Australian identity. Pugliese discusses the 20th-century White Australia policy as a conscious attempt to preserve the \"purity\" of whiteness in Australian society. Likewise Stefanie Affeldt considers whiteness \"a concept not yet fully developed at the time the first convicts and settlers arrived down under\" which, as a social relation, had to be negotiated and was driven forward in particular by the labour movement. Eventually, with the Federation of Australia, \"[o]verlaying social differences, the shared membership in the 'white race' was the catalyst for the consolidation of the Australian colonies as the Commonwealth of Australia\" \n\nIn 1965, drawing from insights from W.E.B. Du Bois and inspired by the Civil Rights movement, Theodore W. Allen began a forty-year analysis of \"white skin privilege\", \"white race\" privilege, and \"white\" privilege. In a piece he drafted for a \"John Brown Commemoration Committee\", he urged that \"White Americans who want government of the people\" and \"by the people\" to \"begin by first repudiating their white skin privileges\". From 1967 to 1969 various versions of the pamphlet, \"White Blindspot\", containing pieces by Allen and Noel Ignatin (Noel Ignatiev), focused on the struggle against \"white skin privilege\" and significantly influenced Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and sectors of the New Left. By June 15, 1969, the \"New York Times\" was reporting that the National Office of SDS was calling \"for an all-out fight against 'white skin privileges'\".\n\nIn 1974–1975, Allen extended his analysis of \"white privilege\", racial oppression, and social control to the colonial period with his ground-breaking \"Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race.\" With continued research, he developed his ideas as his seminal two-volume \"The Invention of the White Race\" published in 1994 and 1997.\n\nFor almost forty years, Allen offered a detailed historical analysis of the origin, maintenance, and functioning of \"white-skin privilege\" and \"white privilege\" in such writings as: \"White Supremacy in U.S. History\" (1973); \"Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race\" (1975); \"The Invention of the White Race,\" Vol. 1: \"Racial Oppression and Social Control\" (1994, 2012); \"The Invention of the White Race,\" Vol. 2: \"The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America\" (1997, 2012); \"Summary of the Argument of 'The Invention of the White Race'\" Parts 1 and 2 (1998); \"In Defense of Affirmative Action in Employment Policy\" (1998); \"'Race' and 'Ethnicity': History and the 2000 Census\" (1999); and \"On Roediger's Wages of Whiteness\" (Revised Edition)\";\n\nIn his historical work, Allen asserted that: \n\nLaura Pulido writes about the relation of white privilege to racism. \n\"White privilege [is] a highly structural and spatial form of racism ... I suggest that historical processes of suburbanization and decentralization are instances of white privilege and have contributed to contemporary patterns of environmental racism.\"Pulido defines environmental racism as \"the idea that nonwhites are disproportionately exposed to pollution\".\n\nWriters such as Peggy McIntosh say that social, political, and cultural advantages are accorded to whites in global society. She argues that these advantages seem invisible to white people, but obvious to non-whites. McIntosh argues that whites utilize their whiteness, consciously or unconsciously, as a framework to classify people and understand their social locations. In addition, even though many white people understand that whiteness is associated with privilege, they do not acknowledge their privilege because they view themselves as average and non-racist. Essentially, whiteness is invisible to white people.\n\nFor instance, \n\"I think whites are carefully taught not to recognize white privilege, as males are taught not to recognize male privilege. So I have begun in an untouched way to ask what it is like to have white privilege. I have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets which I can count on cashing in each day, but about which I was 'meant' to remain oblivious\" (188).McIntosh calls for Americans to acknowledge white privilege so that they can more effectively attain equality in American society. She argues, \n\"To redesign social systems we need first to acknowledge their colossal unseen dimensions. The silences and denials surrounding privilege are the key political tool here. They keep the thinking about equality or equity incomplete, protecting unearned advantage and conferred dominance by making these taboo subjects\" (192).\n\nWhite privilege is also related to \"white guilt\". As Jackson writes in the article, \"White Noises: On Performing White, On Writing Performance\" (1998), \"The rhetorics of white guilt are tiresome, cliche, disingenuous, and everywhere. And now that the stereotype of 'the guilty white' is almost entrenched in its negativity as 'the racist white', people actively try to dis-identify from both.\"\n\nAn offshoot of critical race theory, theorists of critical whiteness studies seek to examine the construction and moral implications of whiteness. There is a great deal of overlap between critical whiteness studies and critical race theory, as demonstrated by focus on the legal and historical construction of white identity, and the use of narratives (whether legal discourse, testimony or fiction) as a tool for exposing systems of racial power.\n\nIn the early 21st century, architectural historians have published studies related to the construction of whiteness in the built environment. Studies have grappled with the exclusionary nature of the architectural profession, which erected barriers for nonwhite practitioners, the ways in which architects and designers have employed motifs, art programs, and color schemes that reflected the aspirations of European-Americans and, most recently, with the racialization of space.\n\nWhiteness and privilege continue in education after Jim Crow versions of the segregationist ideology have lost their legitimacy due to legal and political failures. Privacy and individualism discourses mask white fear and newer forms of exclusion in contemporary education according to scholar, Charles R. Lawrence III.\n\nWriter David Horowitz draws a distinction between whiteness studies and other analogous disciplines. \"Black studies celebrates blackness, Chicano studies celebrates Chicanos, women's studies celebrates women, and white studies attacks white people as evil.\" Dagmar R. Myslinska, an Adjunct Associate Professor of Law at Fordham University, argues that whiteness studies overlooks the heterogeneity of whites' experience, be it due to class, immigrant status, or geographical location.\n\nBarbara Kay, a columnist for the \"National Post\", has sharply criticized whiteness studies, writing that it \"points to a new low in moral vacuity and civilizational self-loathing\" and is an example of \"academic pusillanimity.\" According to Kay, whiteness studies \"cuts to the chase: It is all, and only, about white self-hate.\"\n\nKay noted the leanings of the field by quoting Jeff Hitchcock, co-founder and executive director of the Center for the Study of White American Culture (CSWAC) who stated in a 1998 speech:\nRegarding whiteness studies (WS) more broadly, Kay wrote:\nWS teaches that if you are white, you are branded, literally in the flesh, with evidence of a kind of original sin. You can try to mitigate your evilness, but you can't eradicate it. The goal of WS is to entrench permanent race consciousness in everyone — eternal victimhood for nonwhites, eternal guilt for whites — and was most famously framed by WS chief guru, Noel Ignatiev, former professor at Harvard University [\"sic\", Ignatiev was a Ph.D. student and then a tutor at Harvard, but never a professor], now teaching at the Massachusetts College of Art: \"The key to solving the social problems of our age is to abolish the white race — in other words, to abolish the privileges of the white skin.\"\nIn addition to such criticism in the mass media, whiteness studies has earned a mixed reception from academics in other fields. In 2001, historian Eric Arnesen wrote that \"whiteness has become a blank screen onto which those who claim to analyze it can project their own meanings\" and that the field \"suffers from a number of potentially fatal methodological and conceptual flaws.\" First, Arnesen writes that the core theses of whiteness studies—that racial categories are arbitrary social constructs without definite biological basis, and that some white Americans benefit from racist discrimination of non-whites—have been common wisdom in academia for many decades and are hardly as novel or controversial as whiteness studies scholars seem to believe. Additionally, Arnesen accuses whiteness studies scholars of sloppy thinking; of making claims not supported by their sources; of overstating supporting evidence and cherry picking to neglect contrary information.\n\nHe notes that a particular datum almost entirely ignored by whiteness studies scholars is religion, which has played a prominent role in conflicts among various American classes. He says that a type of \"keyword literalism\" persists in whiteness studies, where important words and phrases from primary sources are taken out of their historical context. Whiteness has so many different definitions that the word is \"nothing less than a moving target.\" Arnesen notes that whiteness studies scholars are entirely on the far left of the political spectrum, and suggests that their apparent vitriol towards white Americans is due in part to white workers not fulfilling the predictions of Marxist theory that the proletariat would overcome racial, national and class distinctions to unite and overthrow capitalism. He cites, as an example, David Roediger’s afterword to the seminal \"Wages of Whiteness\", which asserts that the book was written as a reaction to \"the appalling extent to which white male workers voted for Reaganism in the 1980s.\" Arnesen argues that in the absence of supporting evidence, whiteness studies often rely on amateurish Freudian speculation about the motives of white people: \"The psychoanalysis of whiteness here differs from the 'talking cure' of Freudianism partly in its neglect of the speech of those under study.\" Without more accurate scholarship, Arnesen writes that \"it is time to retire whiteness for more precise historical categories and analytical tools.\"\n\nIn 2002 historian Peter Kolchin offered a more positive assessment and declared that, at its best, whiteness studies has \"unfulfilled potential\" and offers a novel and valuable means of studying history. Particularly, he praises scholarship into the development of the \"concept\" of whiteness in the United States, and notes that the definition and implications of a white racial identity have shifted over the decades. Yet Kolchin describes a \"persistent sense of unease \" with certain aspects of whiteness studies. There is no consensus definition of whiteness, and thus the word is used in vague and contradictory ways, with some scholars even leaving the term undefined in their articles or essays.\" Kolchin also objects to \"a persistent dualism evident in the work of the best whiteness studies authors,\" who often claim that whiteness is a social construct while also arguing, paradoxically, that whiteness is an \"omnipresent and unchanging\" reality existing independent of socialization. Kolchin agrees that entering a post-racial paradigm might be beneficial for humanity, but he challenges the didactic tone of whiteness studies scholars who single out a white racial identification as negative, while praising a black or Asian self-identification. Scholars in whiteness studies sometimes seriously undermine their arguments by interpreting historical evidence independent of its broader context (e.g., Karen Brodkin’s examination of American anti-semitism largely neglects its roots in European anti-semitism). Finally, Kolchin categorically rejects the argument—common amongst many whiteness scholars—that racism and whiteness are intrinsically and uniquely American, and he expresses concern at the \"belief in the moral emptiness of whiteness [...] there is a thin line between saying that whiteness is evil and saying that whites are evil.\"\n\nTheodore W. Allen, pioneering writer on \"white skin privilege\" and \"white privilege\" from the 1960s until his death in 2005, offered a critical review \"On Roediger’s Wages of Whiteness\" (Revised Edition)]. He personally put \"whiteness\" in quotes because he shied away from using the term. As Allen explained, \n\"it’s an abstract noun, it’s an abstraction, it’s an attribute of some people, it’s not the role they play. And the white race is an actual objective thing. It’s not anthropologic, it’s a historically developed identity of European Americans and Anglo-Americans and so it has to be dealt with. It functions... in this history of ours and it has to be recognized as such. . . .to slough it off under the heading of ‘whiteness,’ to me seems to get away from the basic white race identity trauma.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Cuffay was apprenticed to a tailor, and later worked for Matthews and Acworth, on Chatham High Street. He was of short stature, being tall. Cuffay moved to London around 1819 and was married three times. His only daughter Ann Juliana Cuffay, was baptised at St Mary Magdalenes Church, Gillingham.\n\nCuffay rejected the Owenite trade unions of the London tailors. He went on strike with his fellow tailors in 1834, demanding a ten-hour workday between April to July and an eight-hour day during the rest of the year with pay of 6 shillings and 5 pence a day. The strike collapsed, Cuffay was sacked and subsequently blacklisted from employment. In 1839, Cuffay helped to form the Metropolitan Tailors' Charter Association. He was elected first to the Chartist Metropolitan Delegate Council in 1841 and onto the National Executive in 1842.\n\nCuffay was one of the organisers of the large Chartist rally on Kennington Common on 10 April 1848, but was dismayed by the timidity of other leaders, who had rejected the idea that the rally should be a show of force. Cuffay's radical faction soon became involved in plans for a display of \"physical force\".\n\nBetrayed by a government spy, Cuffay was arrested and accused of \"conspiring to levy war\" against Queen Victoria. Defended by eminent barrister John Walter Huddleston, he was convicted of preparing acts of arson, intended as a signal for the planned armed uprising. Sentenced to 21 years penal transportation, Cuffay spent the rest of his life in Tasmania.\n\nThough he was pardoned three years after his conviction, Cuffay elected to stay in Tasmania, working as a tailor and involving himself in local politics. He died in poverty at the Hobart Invalid Depot in July 1870.\n\nCuffay's transportation to Australia did not end his political activity. He continued to organise and agitate for democratic rights in Tasmania until he died in 1870, at the age of 82. Although Cuffay died a pauper, seven Australian newspapers in three states – Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria – published obituaries. One observed that his grave had been \"marked\", should a memorial to him be built at some future time. The memorial never transpired, and Cuffay was forgotten in Australia and Britain. Interest has since been rekindled, with plans in motion to construct the abandoned memorial or a statue on the site.\n\nCuffay was the subject of a 2010 BBC Radio 4 programme entitled \"Britain's Black Revolutionary\" written and presented by the former trades union leader Bill Morris.\n\nCuffay was also the subject of a 2011 ABC Hindsight radio documentary, entitled \"Isle of Denial: William Cuffay in Van Diemen's Land\", which was shortlisted in the NSW Premiers Award in 2012.\n\nDuring the summer of 2013, a small exhibition was mounted in the UK Houses of Parliament, marking the 175th anniversary of the publication of the People's Charter. It included, poignantly, the copy of Byron's collected poetry that London Chartists had given to Cuffay when he was transported, \"as a token of their sincere regard and affection for his genuine patriotism and moral worth\".\n\n\n"}
