At 14, she left school and went to train as a seamstress. It was in her job that she met a Jewish friend, through who she was introduced to a Jewish circle of leftist Hashomer Hatzair. This group of Jewish and non-Jewish Communist friends formed in 1943 the resistance group Přehledy. Among them, Hájková met Jany Lebovič from eastern part of Czechoslovakia, with whom she fell in love. When the transports to Theresienstadt started in fall 1941, Hájková and her family helped the deportees with food and preparation for transports. Later, the gentiles in the group supported the Jewish members avoid transports under a false, non-Jewish identity. Among those who had gone to hiding was Lebovič. Hájková participated in help for Jewish friends and other resistance: in the first months of Terezín ghetto, she visited a few times and smuggled food to her friends. Later, she actively organized papers for those who went into illegality. In March 1944, she was arrested and deported to Small Fortress Theresienstadt and in July 1944 to Ravensbrück concentration camp. Before her liberation in April 1945, she was forced to do forced labor for the German armament industry, firm Hasag in the Schlieben and Altenburg satellite camps of Buchenwald. Hájková escaped in April 1945 from a death march during a bomb raid in Zwickau.\n\nUpon her return to Prague, Hájková learned that her fiancé had been arrested together with most of the Přehledy in August 1944, and murdered in Auschwitz. She and a friend from Přehledy, Miloš Hájek, married and had two sons. Her granddaughter Anna is a historian at the University of Warwick. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1971. She started studying in 1945 at the University of Political and Social Affairs (Vysoká škola politická a sociální), but her studies were interrupted when her children were born. Via long distance, Hájková studied history at the Philosophical Faculty of the Charles University and, in 1960, received her PhD. All the while, she was supporting her husband who was doing academic career. In 1952, at the height of Slánský trials, she was one of the few who supported her friends when they were arrested. In 1960, she started working full time as historian: until 1965, she worked as lecturer of humanities at ČVUT, next five years at the Czechoslovak committee for history of antifascists resistance. During normalization, she spent her last working years as specialist in the defense ministry, where it was her job to write confirmations about participation in resistance according to the law 255/1946. This law enabled many former resistance fighters, who were now dissidents, to live on an early pension.\n\nHájková's expertise was leftist and Communist resistance in Second World War; she focused on individual people and wrote about Jewish Communist resistance fighters who were politically unpopular. Her books and articles are still in circulation, unlike most of contemporary Czech scholarship. In 1989, Hájková was reunited with her old Jewish friends from resistance who had emigrated to Israel and US. In 1991, she was awarded the title Righteous among the nations.\" In 1995, she coedited a critical edition of Julius Fučík's Notes from the Gallows. She cooperated with Miroslav Kárný on researching the Holocaust and resistance in the Protectorate, and contributed to the research of the Terezín Memorial, including their prisoner database. Hájková continued researching until her 80s; and died in Prague in 2012. Her papers are at the Czech National Archive.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1316", "title": "Annales school", "text": "Annales school\n\nThe \"Annales\" school () is a group of historians associated with a style of historiography developed by French historians in the 20th century to stress long-term social history. It is named after its scholarly journal \"Annales d'histoire économique et sociale\", which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs. The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of social scientific methods by historians, emphasizing social rather than political or diplomatic themes, and for being generally hostile to the class analysis of Marxist historiography.\n\nThe school deals primarily with late medieval and early modern Europe (before the French Revolution), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and influenced historiography in Europe and Latin America. Prominent leaders include co-founders Lucien Febvre (1878–1956), Henri Hauser (1866-1946) and Marc Bloch (1886–1944). The second generation was led by Fernand Braudel (1902–1985) and included Georges Duby (1919–1996), Pierre Goubert (1915–2012), Robert Mandrou (1921–1984), Pierre Chaunu (1923–2009), Jacques Le Goff (1924–2014), and Ernest Labrousse (1895–1988). Institutionally it is based on the \"Annales\" journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the École pratique des hautes études, all based in Paris. A third generation was led by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie (1929– ) and includes Jacques Revel, and Philippe Ariès (1914–1984), who joined the group in 1978. The third generation stressed history from the point of view of mentalities, or \"mentalités\". The fourth generation of Annales historians, led by Roger Chartier (1945– ), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the cultural and linguistic turn, which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.\nThe main scholarly outlet has been the journal \"Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale\" (\"Annals of Economic and Social History\"), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. Its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices\nJanmesh Kokate was editor of \"Annales committee \" from 2003 to present, followed by the medievalist Jacques Le Goff. However, informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie. Noting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, Eric Hobsbawm argues that \"in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the \"Annales\" came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply.\" Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history. However, the Annales ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political, and demographic research. An attempt to require an \"Annales\"-written textbook for French schools was rejected by the government. By 1980 postmodern sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives. As Jacques Revel notes, the success of the Annales School, especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces, contained the seeds of its own downfall, for there is \"no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social, identified with the real.\" The Annales School kept its infrastructure, but lost its \"mentalités\".\n\nThe journal began in Strasbourg as \"Annales d'histoire économique et sociale\"; it moved to Paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939. It was successively renamed \"Annales d'histoire sociale\" (1939–1942, 1945), \"Mélanges d'histoire sociale\" (1942–1944), \"Annales. Economies, sociétés, civilisations\" (1946–1994), and \"Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales\" (1994– ).\n\nIn 1962 Braudel and Gaston Berger used Ford Foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death. In 1970 the 6th Section and the \"Annales\" relocated to the FMSH building. FMSH set up elaborate international networks to spread the \"Annales\" gospel across Europe and the world. In 2013 it began publication of an English language edition, with all the articles translated.\n\nThe scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental—there is a search for total history and new approaches. The emphasis is on social history, and very long-term trends, often using quantification and paying special attention to geography and to the intellectual world view of common people, or \"mentality\" (\"mentalité\"). Little attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men. Instead the \"Annales\" focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.\n\nThe \"Annales\" was founded and edited by Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre in 1929, while they were teaching at the University of Strasbourg and later in Paris. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive \"Annales\" approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the \"Année Sociologique\" (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (\"la longue durée\") over events and political transformations. Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called \"mentalités,\" or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the Annales was to undo the work of the Sorbonnistes, to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.\n\nCo-founder Marc Bloch (1886–1944) was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite École Normale Supérieure, and in Germany, serving as a professor at the University of Strasbourg until he was called to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history. Bloch's interests were highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of Paul Vidal de la Blache (1845–1918) and the sociology of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). His own ideas, especially those expressed in his masterworks, \"French Rural History\" (\"Les caractères originaux de l'histoire rurale française,\" 1931) and \"Feudal Society\", were incorporated by the second-generation Annalistes, led by Fernand Braudel.\n\nGeorges Duby, a leader of the school, wrote that the history he taught:\nThe Annalistes, especially Lucien Febvre, advocated a \"histoire totale\", or \"histoire tout court\", a complete study of a historic problem.\n\nBloch was shot by the Gestapo during the German occupation of France in World War II for his active membership of the French Resistance, and Febvre carried on the \"Annales\" approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he mentored Braudel, who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a \"second\" era of \"Annales\" historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of Philip II of Spain. \nBraudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: \"l'histoire quasi immobile\" (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (\"la longue durée\"), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.\n\nWhile authors such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Marc Ferro and Jacques Le Goff continue to carry the \"Annales\" banner, today the \"Annales\" approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in cultural history, political history and economic history.\n\nBloch's \"Les Rois Thaumaturges\" (1924) looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure scrofula by his thaumaturgic touch. The kings of France and England indeed regularly practiced the ritual. Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch—he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations (\"longue durée\") studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events. Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities, or \"mentalités\", resonated with scholars who were reading Freud and Proust. In the 1960s, Robert Mandrou and Georges Duby harmonized the concept of \"mentalité\" history with Fernand Braudel's structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of \"mentalité\" studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, however, \"mentalité\" history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis. While not explicitly rejecting \"mentalité\" history, younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches.\n\nFernand Braudel became the leader of the second generation after 1945. He obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the 6th Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences. It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1975 under the name École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS). Braudel's followers admired his use of the longue durée approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past. The \"Annales\" historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue durée. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. In turn the Marxists called them conservatives.\n\nBraudel's first book, \"La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philippe II\" (1949) (\"The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II\") was his most influential. This vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences, employed effectively the technique of the longue durée, and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals. It stressed geography but not \"mentalité\". It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.\n\nBefore \"Annales,\" French history supposedly happened in Paris. Febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912, with his sweeping doctoral thesis on \"Philippe II et la Franche-Comté.\" The geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the king's policies.\n\nThe \"Annales\" historians did not try to replicate Braudel's vast geographical scope in \"La Méditerranée.\" Instead they focused on regions in France over long stretches of time. The most important was the study of the \"Peasants of Languedoc\" by Braudel's star pupil and successor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie. The regionalist tradition flourished especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the work of Pierre Goubert in 1960 on Beauvais and René Baehrel on Basse-Provence. \"Annales\" historians in the 1970s and 1980s turned to urban regions, including Pierre Deyon (Amiens), Maurice Garden (Lyon), Jean-Pierre Bardet (Rouen), Georges Freche (Toulouse), and Jean-Claude Perrot (Caen). By the 1970s the shift was underway from the earlier economic history to cultural history and the history of mentalities.\n\nThe \"Annales\" school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries. Its success varied widely. The \"Annales\" approach was especially well received in Italy and Poland. Franciszek Bujak (1875–1953) and Jan Rutkowski (1886–1949), the founders of modern economic history in Poland and of the journal \"Roczniki Dziejów Spolecznych i Gospodarczych\" (1931– ), were attracted to the innovations of the Annales school. Rutkowski was in contact with Bloch and others, and published in the \"Annales.\" After the Communists took control in the 1940s Polish scholars were safer working on the Middle Ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history. After the \"Polish October\" of 1956 the Sixth Section in Paris welcomed Polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the \"Annales\" and Polish scholars continued until the early 1980s. The reciprocal influence between the French school and Polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the Middle Ages and the early modern era studied by Braudel.\n\nIn South America the \"Annales\" approach became popular. From the 1950s Federico Brito Figueroa was the founder of a new Venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the Annales School. Brito Figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study, emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences. Spanish historiography was influenced by the \"Annales School\" starting in 1950 with Jaime Vincens Vives (1910–1960). In Mexico, exiled Republican intellectuals extended the Annales approach, particularly from the Center for Historical Studies of El Colegio de México, the leading graduate studies institution of Latin America.\n\nBritish historians, apart from a few Marxists, were generally hostile. Academic historians decidedly sided with Geoffrey Elton's \"The Practice of History\" against Edward Hallett Carr's \"What Is History?\". One of the few British historians who were sympathetic towards the work of the \"Annales\" school was Hugh Trevor-Roper. American, German, Indian, Russian and Japanese scholars generally ignored the school. The Americans developed their own form of \"new social history\" from entirely different roots. Both the American and the \"Annales\" historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from French demographer Louis Henry.\n\nThe Wageningen school centered on Bernard Slicher van Bath was viewed internationally as a Dutch counterpart of the Annales school, although Slicher van Bath himself vehemently rejected the idea of a quantitative \"school\" of historiography.\n\nHas been cited as a key influence in the development of World Systems Theory by sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein.\n\nThe current leader is Roger Chartier, who is Directeur d'Études at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris, Professeur in the Collège de France, and Annenberg Visiting Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania. He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading. Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.\n\nChartier's typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of \"practices,\" his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of \"materials,\" his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of \"places,\" his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the \"Bible\", translations of Ovid, \"Hamlet\", \"Don Quixote\", Montaigne's essays, Pepys's diary, Richardson's \"Pamela\", and Franklin's autobiography.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He studied Law at the Universidad María Cristina de El Escorial, History at the University of Valladolid, and Classical Philology in Madrid, Paris and Berlin . He had as teachers, among others Cayetano de Mergelina, Manuel Gómez-Moreno, Ramón Menéndez Pidal and Eduard Schwyzer.\n\nHe was president of the University Student Federation (FUE) in Valladolid, a republican-leaning organisation, but in September 1936 after beginning the civil war, he adopted a Falangist attitude influenced by his intimate friend Dionisio Ridruejo, and became one of those responsible for the propaganda of the nationalist government in Burgos, though his disillusionment with the Francisco Franco regime started.\n\nDuring the Spanish coup of July 1936 he was in Berlin visiting a Hitler Youth camp. He returned to the nationalist zone. During the Spanish Civil War, Ridruejo as National Chief of Propaganda entrusted the radio departament to Tovar and he was made responsible for Radio Nacional de España when it was being broadcast from Salamanca (1938). He also worked with the Falangist newspaper \"Arriba España\" in Pamplona, edited by Fermín Yzurdiaga.\n\nFollowing his relationship with Ridruejo and in the orbit of Ramón Serrano Súñer, from December 1940 to April 1941 he occupied the position of Under-Secretary of Press and Propaganda. He accompanied Serrano Súñer on several trips to Germany and Italy and during some of these he was present in some meetings with Mussolini and with Hitler.\n\nLeaving political life, he obtained the Latin lectureship at the University of Salamanca in 1942 and from then on devoted himself to teaching and research. He married Consuelo Larrucea the same year. He was member of the early Francoist legislatures.\n\nDuring the ministry of Ruiz-Giménez (1951–1956), Tovar was appointed rector of the university. As rector, he organized the celebrations of its seventh centenary. This was attended by the rectors of the main universities of the world, who made a memorable parade through the streets of Salamanca with their traditional costumes.\n\nAs a result of the centennial celebration of the centennial in 1954, Salamanca restarted awarding doctoral degrees (which the Moyano Law had reserved exclusively to the Central University of Madrid) A large amount of bibliographic materials, which had been taken by French troops leaving Spain in 1813 and kept in the Palais-Royal library, were returned to the university library.\n\nHe created the first chair of \"Basque language and literature\" in Spain, at the University of Salamanca; its first holder was Koldo Mitxelena.\n\nOfficially Tovar remained rector of Salamanca until 1963, even though he had previously left Spain.\n\nHe was a professor at the University of Buenos Aires (1948–1949) and the National University of Tucumán (1958–1959), where he studied the indigenous languages of northern Argentina and tried to create a school that would continue his work in this field.\n\nAt the University of Illinois, he was first named 'Miller Visiting Professor of Classics' (1960–1961), and then 'Professor of Classics' (1963–1967). In 1965 he gained the Latin chair at the University of Madrid, which allowed him to return to Spain. Soon after arriving, there was a student protest, culminating in a demonstration led by Tierno Galván, Aranguren, García Calvo and Montero Díaz. When they were expelled from the university of these (the first three permanently and Montero Diaz temporarily), Tovar resigned in solidarity and returned to the United States until 1967, when he was called to occupy the chair of comparative linguistics in the University of Tubingen (Germany), where he taught until his retirement in 1979.\n\nHe devoted his studies to classical philology and to a large number of languages, including Basque (a Basque-language etymological dictionary is now being published, in collaboration with Manuel Agud and Koldo Mitxelena), proto-Indo-European languages, other indigenous languages of the peninsula such as Iberian, and Amerindian languages. (At the University of Salamanca, a chair in Amerindian languages bears his name.) He spoke a dozen languages and knew 150 others.\n\nHe was editor of the magazine \"Emerita\" (1939-1944), \"Minos\" (1951–1968, along with E. Peruzzi and MS Ruipérez ) and \"Acta Salamantisencia\" (1944-1951). He wrote literary criticism in the magazine \"Gaceta Ilustrada\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45324484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45324484", "title": "Archaeology of the Romani people", "text": "Archaeology of the Romani people\n\nArchaeology of the Romani people refers to the science of archaeology as applied in relation to the Romani people, an ethnic group dispersed across the world, which is known under several different names. The Romani people has a long history, and most likely hails from the Indian subcontinent. Throughout said history, the highly diverse Roma population has faced significant persecution – antiziganism – in many parts of the world, and continues to do so today.\n\nDue to the Romani people's frequent status as outsiders in regards to mainstream society and a constant minority, lacking any form of nation state and in turn facing structural bias and neglect from many national, regional and local governments and authorities, the research done into Romani history and culture has often been either lacking or non-existent. In modern times, even when this issue gradually being resolved in some areas, the field of Romani archaeology remains virtually unexplored. For example, the prominent Hungarian archaeologist Eszter Bánffy (), director of the \"Römisch-Germanische Kommission\" of the German Archaeological Institute, has written that in all of post-Cold War era Eastern Europe, she has not found a single archaeologist of Romani heritage, nor anyone interested in researching let alone excavating possible Romani archaeological sites.\n\nWhile the French sociologist Jean-Pierre Liégeois (), director of the Gypsy Research Centre, has asserted that due to their often highly mobile lifestyle and frequent societal discrimination, the Romani have left behind no such archaeological sites, there have been some limited field surveys and excavations of Romani-related sites.\n\nThis is especially the case in Sweden and Norway, where the Norwegian and Swedish Travellers arrived in the early 16th century. Two sites in particular have gone through several stages of excavation, with a third excavation project beginning in 2015. One is Snarsmon (also pejoratively called Tattarstaden, roughly \"the Gypsy Town\"), a Romani village close to the Norwegian border in Tanum Municipality which was active as a sanctuary from the 1860s until the first years of the 20th century. Surveys began in 2003, with yearly excavations between 2004 and 2007. Done in the style of community archaeology, participants – other than professional archaeologists – included both local inhabitants of non-Romani origin, as well as members from several Traveller organizations and one Roma cultural association. One result of this project was the establishment in 2012 of the first Swedish museum exhibition about Traveller history, located in the town of Uddevalla, featuring some of the objects found during the excavations.\n\nThe second Swedish site is Krämarstaden (roughly translated, \"the Huckster Town\"), likewise a Romani village, located near Finnerödja in Laxå Municipality. The village was established in the first years of the 20th century, and abandoned in the beginning of the 1920s. Core surveys began at the same time as those in Snarsmon, with two phases of archaeological excavation taking place in 2013 and 2014, which much like the previous project involved professional archaeologists and other scientists, local inhabitants, and Swedish Travellers. \n\nIn August 2015, excavations began at a Romani campsite outside of Stockholm, in Skarpnäck. The camp was built in 1959 by the Swedish state as a temporary solution, until apartments could be arranged for the Romani, who had just been given full civic rights (and with that, a right to housing). The camp soon became permanent as the administrative process was dragged out, its inhabitants – about thirty people – living in tents, caravans and two home-built cottages, exposed to the weather. The two-year project, titled \"I stadens utkant\" (\"In the City's Fringe\"), is financed partially by the Swedish National Heritage Board, and is a cooperative project between the Swedish History Museum, the cultural association \"É Romani Glinda\" (the Romani Mirror), Mångkulturellt Centrum (Multicultural Center) in Botkyrka, and Stiftelsen Kulturmiljövård (the Cultural Environment Management Foundation). It will result in a book and an excavation report, in addition to certain finds forming part of the \"Sweden's History\" exhibition at the Swedish History Museum.\n\nSeveral other archaeological sites belonging to the Romani people and the Scandinavian Travellers exist in Sweden as well as Norway, some of which were surveyed and mapped out in the transnational Scandinavian Traveller Map project. One of these, Tattardalen (\"Gypsy Valley\") in Kungälv Municipality, is a ruined farmstead dating back to the 1600s, and is therefore the oldest Scandinavian site connected to the Travellers.\n\nAnother example of possibly Romani-related archaeology is a June 2010 excavation of the \"Caird’s Cave\" in Rosemarkie, Scotland, a site possibly inhabited by Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups. In addition to archaeology directly relating to Romani sites, there have also been some research done into the archaeogenetics and \"linguistic archaeology\" of the Romani people. An example of this is the discovery of a skeleton in a Anglo-Saxon cemetery under Norwich Castle in Norfolk, which – as reported by \"British Archaeology\" – was genetically identified as a possible Romani man.\n\n"}

Serving first as administrator (\"alispán\") of Zólyom County, in the 1878 elections he was elected a member of the Hungarian House of Representatives for Szliács (modern Sliač) in that county as a member of the Liberal Party; he subsequently left the Liberals in 1880, serving as an independent before joining the Moderate Opposition party. He was an activist for the assimilationist policies of Magyarisation in the predominantly Slovak region of Upper Hungary, founding and supporting the Upper Hungary Magyar Educational Society. He viewed the construction of a centralised state as a political priority.\n\nIn his book \"Közigazgatásunk és a szabadság\" (Budapest, 1876) (Our public administration and freedom) he explained his views about the nationalization/Hungarianization policy, he urged the Hungarian politicians to act so effective and inexorable, like the French did in France and English did in the United Kingdom. \n\nAs a historian, Grünwald became a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences after the publication of his 1888 work, \"The Old Hungary\" (\"A régi Magyarország\"). In his historical works, he pursued a \"democratic\" method of historiography. He stated in \"The New Hungary\" (\"Az új Magyarország\"), the sequel to his 1888 book, \"The genius, too, is born. He is born in a particular age, as a member of a particular nation, a class and a family, and the stamp these circles press onto his personality in his youth stays on him even if he has later come into conflict with them.\" He charged the Hungarian nobility with a lack of national sentiment, and feeling greater solidarity with nobles from other nations than with the Hungarian nation; the nobles, he argued, had neglected the development of Hungary as a nation-state. Nevertheless, on 22 April 1889, he accepted ennoblement from Emperor Franz Joseph I, becoming \"de Bártfa\" (\"bártfai\").\n\nGrünwald committed suicide by gunshot wound to the head in unclear circumstances while visiting Paris on 4 May 1891. Shortly before his suicide, he sent a telegram to Albert Apponyi, the leader of the Moderate Opposition, briefly notifying him of his death: \"Béla Grünwald has died after a long period of suffering\". In his famous dramatic 1929 account, \"The Paris Story\" (\"A párizsi regény\"), Dezső Szomory describes Grünwald's death and burial:\n\nGrünwald's epitaph reads, \"Here lies Béla Grünwald, unbreakable apostle of the Hungarian theory of the state.\"\n\n\n"}

After the infant's mother, Aleksandra Mikhailovna (Veligorskaya) Andreyeva (a great-niece of Taras Shevchenko), died shortly after childbirth, Leonid Andreyev gave the infant Daniil to his late wife's sister, Elizabeth Mikhailovna Dobrova, to raise. This act had two important consequences: it meant that when Leonid Andreev, like many other writers and intellectuals, left Russia (he emigrated to the newly independent Finland in December 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution), his young son remained behind; it also meant that Daniil was raised in a household that remained deeply religious.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, the boy Daniil had a pronounced literary bent; he began writing poetry and prose in early childhood. He graduated from high school but could not attend university because of his \"non-proletarian\" background. Supporting himself as a graphic artist, he wrote in his spare time.\n\nDaniil Andreyev was conscripted into the Red Army in 1942. He served as a non-combatant, and during the Siege of Leningrad of 1941-1944 helped to transport supplies across Lake Ladoga. After World War II Andreev returned to civilian life, but the Soviet authorities arrested him in April 1947, charged him with anti-Soviet propaganda and preparations to assassinate Joseph Stalin, and sentenced him to 25 years of imprisonment. He suffered a heart attack in prison in 1954, the first manifestation of the heart condition that would eventually cause his death. In the same year his sentence was reduced to 10 years. He was released on April 22, 1957, already terminally ill. He was officially rehabilitated on July 11, 1957.\n\nWhile incarcerated in Vladimir Central Prison from 1947 to 1957, Andreyev experienced mystic visions and started writing \"Roza Mira\", finishing it after his release. The book became known in the Soviet Union via samizdat, but was first officially published only in 1991. In 1997 Lindisfarne Books published Jordan Roberts's English-language translation of \"Roza Mira\"\nin the USA.\n\nAlmost all works that Andreev wrote before 1947, were destroyed by Ministry for State Security (MGB) as \"anti-Soviet literature\", including his novel \"Wanderers of Night\" () about the spiritual opposition to the Soviet regime and atheism. Being imprisoned, however, Andreev managed to restore some of his poems. He also tried to restore \"Wanderers of Night\", but he could only restore a few pages of it. Also some works of his childhood were kept by his friend, including his first poems written at the age of 8.\n\nHis main book, \"Roza Mira\" (, literally \"The Rose of the World\") contains a detailed description of numerous layers of spiritual reality that surround Earth, of the forthcoming religion called Roza Mira that will emerge and unite all people and states, and of the events of the future advent of Antichrist and his fall.\n\nApart from Roza Mira, he wrote a poem \"The Iron Mystery\" (, published in 1990), a \"poetic ensemble\" (that is what he called it) \"Russian gods\" (, full text published in 1995) and other works.\n\n"}

The MQ-9 and other UAVs are referred to as Remotely Piloted Vehicles/Aircraft (RPV/RPA) by the USAF to indicate their human ground controllers. The MQ-9 is the first hunter-killer UAV designed for long-endurance, high-altitude surveillance. In 2006, the then–Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force General T. Michael Moseley said: \"We've moved from using UAVs primarily in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance roles before Operation Iraqi Freedom, to a true hunter-killer role with the Reaper.\"\n\nThe MQ-9 is a larger, heavier, and more capable aircraft than the earlier General Atomics MQ-1 Predator; it can be controlled by the same ground systems used to control MQ-1s. The Reaper has a 950-shaft-horsepower (712 kW) turboprop engine (compared to the Predator's piston engine). The greater power allows the Reaper to carry 15 times more ordnance payload and cruise at about three times the speed of the MQ-1. The aircraft is monitored and controlled by aircrew in the Ground Control Station (GCS), including weapons employment.\n\nIn 2008, the New York Air National Guard 174th Attack Wing began the transition from F-16 piloted fighters to MQ-9A Reapers, becoming the first fighter unit to convert entirely to unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) use. In March 2011, the U.S. Air Force was training more pilots for advanced unmanned aerial vehicles than for any other single weapons system. The Reaper is also used by the United States Navy, the CIA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, NASA, and the militaries of several other countries. \n\nThe USAF operated 195 MQ-9 Reapers as of September 2016, and plans to keep the MQ-9 in service into the 2030s.\n\nGeneral Atomics began development with the \"Predator B-001\", a proof-of-concept aircraft, which first flew on 2 February 2001. Abraham Karem is the designer of the Predator. The B-001 was powered by an AlliedSignal Garrett TPE331-10T turboprop engine with . It had an airframe that was based on the standard Predator airframe, except with an enlarged fuselage and wings lengthened from to . The B-001 had a speed of and could carry a payload of to an altitude of with an endurance of 30 hours.\n\nThe company refined the design, taking it in two separate directions. The first was a jet-powered version; \"Predator B-002\" was fitted with a Williams FJ44-2A turbofan engine with thrust. It had payload capacity of , a ceiling of and endurance of 12 hours. The USAF ordered two airframes for evaluation, delivered in 2007. The first two airframes delivered with prototypes B-001 and B-002 (now in the USAF museum at Wright-Patterson AFB). B-002 was originally equipped with the FJ-44 engine but it was removed and a TPE-331-10T was installed so that the USAF could take delivery of two aircraft in the same configuration.\n\nThe second direction the design took was the \"Predator B-003\", referred to by GA as the \"Altair\", which has a new airframe with an wingspan and a takeoff weight of approximately . Like the Predator B-001, it is powered by a TPE-331-10YGD turboprop. This variant has a payload capacity of , a maximum ceiling of , and an endurance of 36 hours.\n\nIn October 2001, the USAF signed a contract for an initial pair of Predator Bs (001 and 002) for evaluation. Designated YMQ-9s due to their prototype role, they were delivered in 2002. The USAF referred to it as \"Predator B\" until it was renamed \"Reaper\". The USAF aimed for the Predator B to provide an improved \"deadly persistence\" capability, flying over a combat area night-and-day waiting for a target to present itself, complementing piloted attack aircraft, typically used to drop larger quantities of ordnance on a target, while a cheaper RPV can operate almost continuously using ground controllers working in shifts, but carrying less ordnance.\n\nOperators, stationed at bases such as Creech Air Force Base, near Las Vegas, Nevada, can hunt for targets and observe terrain using multiple sensors, including a thermographic camera. One claim was that the on-board camera is able to read a license plate from away. An operator's command takes 1.2 seconds to reach the drone via a satellite link. The MQ-9 is fitted with six stores pylons; the inner stores pylons can carry a maximum of each and allow carriage of external fuel tanks. The mid-wing stores pylons can carry a maximum of each, while the outer stores pylons can carry a maximum of each. An MQ-9 with two external fuel tanks and one thousand pounds of munitions has an endurance of 42 hours. The Reaper has an endurance of 14 hours when fully loaded with munitions. The MQ-9 carries a variety of weapons including the GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bomb, the AGM-114 Hellfire II air-to-ground missiles, the AIM-9 Sidewinder, and the GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). Tests are underway to allow for the addition of the AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missile.\n\nBy October 2007, the USAF owned nine Reapers, and by December 2010 had 57 with plans to buy another 272, for a total of 329 Reapers. Critics have stated that the USAF's insistence on qualified pilots flying RPVs is a bottleneck to expanding deployment. USAF Major General William Rew stated on 5 August 2008, \"For the way we fly them right now\"—fully integrated into air operations and often flying missions alongside manned aircraft—\"we want pilots to fly them.\" This reportedly has exacerbated losses of USAF aircraft in comparison with US Army operations. In March 2011, U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Robert Gates stated that, while manned aircraft are needed, the USAF must recognize \"the enormous strategic and cultural implications of the vast expansion in remotely piloted vehicles...\" and stated that as the service buys manned fighters and bombers, it must give equal weight to unmanned drones and \"the service's important role in the cyber and space domains.\"\n\nIn 2013, the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) sought the ability to pack up an MQ-9 in less than eight hours, fly it anywhere in the world aboard a C-17 Globemaster III, and then have it ready to fly in another eight hours to support special operations teams at places with no infrastructure. MQ-1 and MQ-9 drones must fly aboard cargo aircraft to travel long distances as they lack the refueling technology or speed to travel themselves; the C-17 is large enough to carry the aircraft and support systems and can land on short runways. Pilots traveling with the Reaper will use the ground control station to launch and land the aircraft, while most of the flying will be done by US-based pilots.\n\nIn November 2012, Raytheon completed ground verification tests for the ADM-160 MALD and MALD-J for integration onto the Reaper for an unmanned suppression of enemy air defenses capability. On 12 April 2013, a company-owned MQ-9 equipped with a jamming pod and digital receiver/exciter successfully demonstrated its electronic warfare capability at Marine Corp Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, performing its mission in coordination with over 20 participating aircraft. A second electronic warfare test, fitted with the Northrop Grumman Pandora EW System, was conducted on 22 October 2013 with other unmanned aircraft and Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowlers, showing effectiveness in a multi-node approach against a more capable IADS.\n\nIn 2011, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) reported its interest in using the Reaper and its MTS-B sensor to provide firing quality data for early interception of ballistic missile launches. The MDA is exploring concepts to use the UAV's EO/IR sensor to achieve \"launch-on-remote\" capabilities with missile interceptors before detection by Aegis radars. At least two aircraft would be needed to triangulate a target to provide high-fidelity data. The MTS-B includes short and mid-wave IR bands, optimal for tracking launch and rocket burn. In 2013, the MDA terminated plans to build a follow-on to the two orbiting Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) satellites due to near-term costs, opting to continue testing the Reaper for ballistic missile target discrimination. The MDA planned to test the improved MTS-C sensor, which adds a long-wave IR detector optimized for tracking cold bodies such as missiles and warheads after booster burnout, or plumes and exhaust. The goal is to use data from multiple high-flying UAVs to provide an off-board cue to launch an SM-3 missile from an Aegis ship. Two Reapers demonstrated their ability to track ballistic missiles using their MTS-B EO/IR turret during a test in late June 2016.\n\nIn June 2015, a study by the USAF's Scientific Advisory Board identified several improvements for operating the Reaper in contested airspace; adding readily available sensors, weapons, and threat detection and countermeasures could increase situational awareness and enable riskier deployments. Suggestions included a radar warning receiver (RWR) to know when it's being targeted, air-to-air and miniature air-to-ground weapons, manned-unmanned teaming, multi-UAV control, automatic take-offs and landings, and precision navigation and timing systems to fly in GPS-denied areas. Another idea was redesigned ground control stations with user-friendly video game-like controllers and touchscreen maps to access data without overwhelming operators.\n\nIn October 2015, Air Force deputy chief of staff for ISR Robert Otto suggested redesigning the MQ-9's GCS to be operated by one person for most missions rather than two (to fly and work the sensors) to simplify operations and reduce manpower requirements by hundreds of sensor operators. Introducing an auto-land capability would also reduce the Reaper's manpower requirements to staff launch and recovery teams. Automatic take-off and landing capabilities are already present in the RQ-4 Global Hawk and MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and are planned to be provided to the MQ-9 in 2017. The Air Force requires the manually loaded Reaper to operate from a runway at least long, but automated take-offs and landings would enable it to operate from a runway.\n\nIn April 2017, an MQ-9 Block 5 flew with a Raytheon ALR-69A RWR in its payload pod to demonstrate the aircraft's ability to conduct missions in the proximity of threat radars and air defenses, the first time this capability was demonstrated on a remotely piloted aircraft.\n\nA typical MQ-9 system consists of multiple aircraft, ground control station, communications equipment, maintenance spares, and personnel. A military crew includes a pilot, sensor operator, and Mission Intelligence Coordinator. The aircraft is powered by a turboprop, with a maximum speed of about and a cruising speed of . With a wingspan, and a maximum payload of , the MQ-9 can be armed with a variety of weaponry, including Hellfire missiles and 500-lb laser-guided bomb units. Endurance is 30 hours when conducting ISR missions, which decreases to 23 hours if it is carrying a full weapons load. The Reaper has a range of and an operational altitude of , which makes it especially useful for long-term loitering operations, both for surveillance and support of ground troops.\nThe Predator and Reaper were designed for military operations and not intended to operate among crowded airline traffic. The aircraft typically lack systems capable of complying with FAA See-And-Avoid regulations. On 18 May 2006, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a certificate of authorization allowing MQ-1 and MQ-9 UAVs to fly in U.S. civil airspace to search for survivors of disasters. In 2005, requests were made for MQ-9s to be used in search and rescue operations following Hurricane Katrina but, as there was no FAA authorization in place at the time, it was not used.\n\nAn MQ-9 can adopt various mission kits and combinations of weapons and sensors payloads to meet combat requirements. Its Raytheon AN/AAS-52 multi-spectral targeting sensor suite includes a color/monochrome daylight TV, infrared, and image-intensified TV with laser rangefinder/laser designator to designate targets for laser guided munitions. The aircraft is also equipped with the Lynx Multi-mode Radar that contains synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that can operate in both spotlight and strip modes, and ground moving target indication (GMTI) with Dismount Moving Target Indicator (DMTI) and Maritime Wide-Area Search (MWAS) capabilities. The Reaper was used as a test bed for Gorgon Stare, a wide-area surveillance sensor system. Increment 1 of the system was first fielded in March 2011 on the Reaper and could cover an area of ; increment 2, incorporating ARGUS-IS and expanding the coverage area to , achieved initial operating capability (IOC) in early 2014. The system has 368 cameras capable of capturing five million pixels each to create an image of about 1.8 billion pixels; video is collected at 12 frames per second, producing several terabytes of data per minute.\n\nIn January 2012, General Atomics released a new trailing arm design for the Reaper's main landing gear; benefits include an over 30 percent increase in landing weight capacity, a 12 percent increase in gross takeoff weight (from to ), a maintenance-free shock absorber (eliminating the need for nitrogen pressurization), a fully rejected takeoff brake system, and provisions for automatic takeoff and landing capability and Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) field upgrades. In April 2012, General Atomics announced possible upgrades to USAF Reapers, including two extra fuel pods under the wings to increase endurance to 37 hours. The wingspan can also be increased to , increasing endurance to 42 hours. The USAF has bought 38 Reaper Extended Range (ER) versions, carrying external fuel tanks (which don't affect weapon capacity), the heavy-weight landing gear, a four-bladed propeller, a new fuel management system which ensures fuel and thermal balance among external tank, wing, and fuselage fuel sources, and an alcohol water injection (AWI) system to shorten required runway takeoff length; these features increase endurance from 27 to 33–35 hours, while the company is still pitching the lengthened wing option. The Reaper ER first flew operationally in August 2015. The aircraft also has the sensor ball replaced with a high-definition camera, better communications so ground controllers can see the higher quality video, software to enable automatic detection of threats and tracking of 12 moving targets at once, and the ability to \"super ripple\" fire missiles within 0.32 seconds of each other.\n\nOn 25 February 2016, General Atomics announced a successful test flight of the new Predator-B/ER version. This new version has had the wingspan extended to 79 feet, increasing its endurance to 40 hours. Other improvements include \"short-field takeoff and landing performance and spoilers on the wings which enable precision automatic landings. The wings also have provisions for leading-edge de-ice and integrated low- and high-band RF antennas.\"\n\nOn 1 May 2007, the USAF's 432d Wing was activated to operate MQ-9 Reaper as well as MQ-1 Predator UAVs at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada. The pilots first conducted combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan in the summer of 2007. On 28 October 2007, the \"Air Force Times\" reported an MQ-9 had achieved its first \"kill\", successfully firing a Hellfire missile against Afghanistan insurgents in the Deh Rawood region of the mountainous Oruzgan province. By 6 March 2008, according to USAF Lieutenant General Gary North, the Reaper had attacked 16 targets in Afghanistan using bombs and Hellfire missiles.\n\nOn 17 July 2008, the USAF began flying Reaper missions within Iraq from Balad Air Base. It was reported on 11 August 2008 that the 174th Fighter Wing would consist entirely of Reapers. By March 2009 the USAF had 28 operational Reapers. Beginning in September 2009, Reapers were deployed by the Africa Command to the Seychelles islands for use in Indian Ocean anti-piracy patrols.\n\nOn 13 September 2009, positive control of an MQ-9 was lost during a combat mission over Afghanistan, after which the control-less drone started flying towards the Afghan border with Tajikistan. An F-15E Strike Eagle fired an AIM-9 missile at the drone, successfully destroying its engine. Before the drone impacted the ground, contact was reestablished with the drone, and it was flown into a mountain to destroy it. It was the first US drone to be destroyed intentionally by allied forces.\n\nBy July 2010, thirty-eight Predators and Reapers had been lost during combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, another nine were lost in training missions in the U.S. In 2010, the USAF conducted over 33,000 close air support missions, a more-than-20 percent increase compared with 2009. By March 2011, the USAF had 48 Predator and Reaper combat air patrols flying in Iraq and Afghanistan compared with 18 in 2007.\nAs of March 2011, the USAF was training more pilots for advanced unmanned aerial vehicles than for any other single weapons system. In 2012, the Reaper, Predator and Global Hawk were described as \"... the most accident-prone aircraft in the Air Force fleet.\" These figures must be taken with caution due to the aircraft's nature, often performing hostile or dangerous missions.\n\nIn October 2011, the USAF began operating Reapers out of Arba Minch Airport in Ethiopia for surveillance-only operations in Somalia. In 2012, both Reapers and Predators were deployed in Benghazi, Libya after the attack that killed the US ambassador in that city. In February 2013, the U.S. stationed a Predator at Niamey to provide intelligence for French forces during Operation Serval in Mali, it was later replaced by two MQ-9 Reapers. In April 2013, one of these Reapers crashed on a surveillance flight due to mechanical failure.\n\nOn 22 October 2013, the USAF's fleets of MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper UAVs reached 2,000,000 flight hours. The RPA program began in the mid-1990s, taking 16 years for them to reach 1 million flight hours; the 2 million hour mark was reached just two and a half years later.\n\nThe high demand for UAVs has caused Air Combat Command to increase pilot output from 188 in 2015 to 300 in 2017 at Holloman.\n\nOn 13 November 2015, the Pentagon reported that an MQ-9 had killed ISIL member Mohammed Emwazi, popularly known as \"Jihadi John\", who was responsible for executing several Western prisoners.\n\nIn 2015, a record number (20) of Air Force drones crashed. Working with engineers from General Atomics, investigators identified three parts of the starter-generator that were susceptible to breakdowns. But they could not determine why they were failing. Col. William S. Leister informed Pentagon officials that investigators from the Air Force, General Atomics and Skurka had investigated the problem for more than a year. The team, he said, had identified \"numerous manufacturing quality issues\" yet had been unable to determine the exact cause of the failures.\n\nOn 2 October 2017, U.S. Central Command stated that a MQ-9 had been shot down by Houthi air defense systems over Sanaa in western Yemen the previous day. The aircraft took off from Chabelley Airport in Djibouti, and was armed.\n\nNASA initially expressed interest in a production version of the B-002 turbofan-powered variant, but instead leased an unarmed Reaper variant, which carries the GA-ASI company name \"Altair\". Altair is one of the first three \"Predator-B\" airframes. The other two airframes, known as \"Predator-B 001\" and \"Predator-B 002\", had a maximum gross weight of . Altair differs from these models in that it has an long wingspan ( greater than early and current MQ-9s). The Altair has enhanced avionics systems to better enable flights in FAA-controlled civil airspace and demonstrate \"over-the-horizon\" command and control capability from a ground station. These aircraft are used by NASA's Earth Science Enterprise as part of the NASA ERAST Program to perform on-location science missions.\n\nIn November 2006, NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center obtained an MQ-9 (and mobile ground control station), named \"Ikhana\", for the Suborbital Science Program within the Science Mission Directorate. In 2007, Ihkana was used to survey the Southern California wildfires, supporting firefighter deployments based upon the highest need. The California Office of Emergency Services had requested NASA support for the Esperanza Fire, and the General Atomics Altair was launched less than 24 hours later on a 16-hour mission to map the fire's perimeter. The fire mapping research is a joint project with NASA and the US Forest Service.\n\nThe NASA Ikhana was used to survey the descent of the Orion Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) module on its first test mission 5 December 2014. The aircraft loitered at , used its IR camera to detect the capsule, then switched to the optical camera to observe its descent through parachute deployment and landing in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operated nine MQ-9s in August 2012. Two were based in North Dakota at Grand Forks Air Force Base, four were based in Arizona, at Fort Huachuca and one was based at the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. These aircraft were equipped with GA-ASI's Lynx synthetic aperture radar and Raytheon's MTS-B electro-optical infrared sensors. CBP also had two maritime MQ-9s called Guardians, based at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. The Guardians were equipped with the SeaVue marine search radar; their electro-optical infrared sensor was optimized for maritime operations. The CBP operates one MQ-9 Guardian jointly with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) out of land-based stations in Florida and Texas.\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security initially ordered one Predator B for border protection duty, referred to as MQ-9 CBP-101. It began operations 4 October 2005 and crashed in the Arizona desert on 25 April 2006. The US's NTSB determined that the crash's cause most likely pilot error by the ground-based pilot, inadvertently shutting down the UAV's engine by failing to follow the checklist. During its operational period, the aircraft flew 959 hours on patrol and had a part in 2,309 arrests. It also contributed to the seizure of four vehicles and of marijuana.\n\nA second Predator B, called \"CBP-104\" (initially referred to as \"CBP-102\"), was delivered in September 2006 and commenced limited border protection operations on 18 October 2006. The president's FY2006 emergency supplemental budget request added $45 million for the program and the FY2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill added an additional $20 million. In October 2006, GA-ASI announced a $33.9 million contract to supply two more Predator B systems by the fall of 2007. On 16 February 2009, the program was further expanded to include patrols of the Canada–US border.\n\nOn 14 October 2013, an MQ-9 began patrolling the Manitoba portion of the U.S.-Canada border. The UAV is based at Grand Forks Air Force Base and will watch the -long border. The drone will not carry weapons and needs permission to enter Canadian airspace. U.S. authorities fear that drug smugglers, migrants, and terrorists may exploit the long border. The use of the unmanned surveillance aircraft is an enhancement of the partnership between U.S. and Canadian agencies.\n\nIn January 2014, Customs and Border Protection grounded its UAVs temporarily after an unmanned aircraft was ditched off the coast of California by the operator due to a mechanical failure on 27 January 2014.\n\nIn September 2006, the General Atomics Mariner demonstrator aircraft was operated by the Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) in an exercise designed to evaluate the aircraft's ability to aid in efforts to stem illegal fishing, drug running and illegal immigration. The Mariner operated from RAAF bases Edinburgh, South Australia and Learmonth, Western Australia in conjunction with a Royal Australian Navy \"Armidale\" class patrol boat, the Joint Offshore Protection Command and the Pilbara Regiment.\n\nIn February 2015, it was announced that six RAAF personnel have been sent to Holloman AFB in New Mexico and Creech AFB in Nevada to undergo training.\n\nIn August 2015, it was revealed that Australians had begun flying MQ-9s over Syria, the first time Australia expanded operations past Iraq during the Military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Five RAAF personnel were embedded with the USAF 432d Operations Group, which flies armed Reapers, performing operational duties with the unit as MQ-9 system pilots and sensor operators.\n\nIn November 2018, the Defence Minister Christoper Pine announced that Australia would purchase between 12 and 16 MQ-9s.\n\nThe Predator UAV \"Guardian\" has been used by the Dominican Republic, under U.S. supervision and funding, against drug trafficking from mid-2012.\n\nOn 31 May 2013, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian confirmed the order of two MQ-9 Reapers, to be delivered by the end of 2013. It was chosen to replace the EADS Harfang and was picked over the Israeli Heron TP. On 27 June 2013, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of a possible Foreign Military Sale to France for 16 unarmed MQ-9s, associated equipment, ground control hardware, and support, worth up to $1.5 billion total. On 26 August 2013, France and the US Department of Defense concluded the deal for 16 Reapers and 8 ground control stations, with French operators beginning training.\n\nOn 24 September 2013, France's first pair of MQ-9 pilots conducted a two-hour training sortie at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. Both French pilots had prior UAV experience, and went through a five-week ground-based training course and 5 hours on a flight simulator before the first flight. Two additional crews were also receiving instruction at the facility. General Atomics is due to deliver two Reapers and one ground control station to the French Air Force by the end of 2013. On 26 November 2013, France declared that six pilots in three teams were operational, following 100 hours on flight simulators and 4 flights. French MQ-9s were first put into action in January 2014 at Niamey Air Base in Niger for border reconnaissance in the Sahel desert.\n\nOn 16 January 2014, France's first MQ-9 flight occurred from Niger. The first two Reapers to enter French service are designated Block 1 and use U.S. equipment; further orders are to be modified with European payloads such as sensors and datalinks. On 31 March 2014, French Air Force Reapers accumulated 500 flight hours in support of Operation Serval. In July 2014, a French MQ-9 helped to locate the wreckage of Air Algérie Flight 5017, which had crashed in Mali.\n\nGermany made a request to purchase five Reapers and four ground control stations, plus related support material and training. The request, being made through the Foreign Military Sales process, was presented to Congress through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency on 1 August 2008 and is valued at US$205 million. However, Germany did not go through with this procurement for the time being and decided to lease the IAI Heron offered by IAI and Rheinmetall instead, initially for the duration of one year, representing a stop-gap measure before a long-term decision on a MALE-system is being made.\n\nOn 1 August 2008, Italy submitted a FMS request through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency for four aircraft, four ground stations and five years of maintenance support, all valued at US$330 million. Italy ordered two more aircraft in November 2009. On 30 May 2012, it was reported that the U.S. planned to sell kits to arm Italy's six Reapers with Hellfire missiles and laser-guided bombs. However Gen. Alberto Rosso has expressed frustration at American delays in integrating additional weapons onto the platform and suggested that Italy may have to seek UAS alternatives. Italian Reapers were used:\n\nOn 3 November 2015, the U.S. approved a deal covering weapons integration onto Italy's Reaper aircraft, which would make it the first country outside the UK to weaponise the drone. The potential for increased contribution to NATO coalition operations, improved operational flexibility, and enhanced survivability for Italian forces prompted the request.\n\nOn 19 June 2013, General Atomics and Fokker Technologies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to offer the MQ-9 Reaper to the Dutch government for their need of a Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (MALE) UAV. The MOU recognizes that Fokker will assist in maintenance and support of the aircraft in the Netherlands if a deal goes through.\n\nOn 21 November 2013, the Dutch Minister of Defense announced that the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) has selected the MQ-9 Reaper Block-V as its new MALE UAV. The new MALE UAV 306 squadron will be based at Leeuwarden Air Base. In July 2018 the Dutch government signed a Letter of Acceptance for the acquisition through the Foreign Military Sales process. The Dutch MQ-9 are to have the Synthetic Aperture Radar with the Maritime Search option and also a special ground search radar with more range and electronic sensors to detect ground radar and signals. The RNLAF plans to buy four ground stations (two at homebase, 2 at foreward operating base) and four MQ-9s block-V. The aircraft are to reach full operational status in 2020. Currently no weapons are planned for the Reapers, but are 'provided for'.\n\nOn 6 August 2015, the Spanish Ministry of Defence announced it would buy four Reaper surveillance aircraft with two ground control stations for €25 million ($27 million) in 2016, costing €171 million over five years. General Atomics will partner with Spanish Company SENER to deliver unarmed versions to Spain, making it the fifth European country to order the Reaper. In addition to selecting the Reaper, Spain is interested in the joint German-French-Italian project to develop a European MALE UAV. The Defense Department cleared the purchase on 6 October 2015. Spain selected the Reaper over the Heron TP to perform homeland security, counter-insurgency, and counter-terrorism operations. The Spanish government agreed to purchase the system on 30 October. The Reaper was selected over the Heron TP mainly for commonality with NATO allies who also use the airframe. Although Spain's immediate priority is for surveillance, they will eventually try to weaponize the platform. The first two aircraft and first GCS is planned for delivery in 2017, with the third aircraft in 2018 when they achieve IOC, and the last in 2020 achieving full operational capability (FOC).\n\nOn 27 September 2006, the U.S. Congress was notified by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency that the United Kingdom was seeking to purchase a pair of MQ-9A Reapers. They were initially operated by No. 39 Squadron RAF from Creech Air Force Base, Nevada later moving to RAF Waddington. A third MQ-9A was in the process of being purchased by the RAF in 2007. On 9 November 2007, the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) announced that its Reapers had begun operations in Afghanistan against the Taliban. In April 2008, following the crash of one of the UK's two Reapers, British special forces were sent to recover sensitive material from the wreckage before it was blown up to prevent the enemy from obtaining it. By May 2011, five Reapers were in operation, with a further five on order.\n\nThe second RAF squadron to operate five Reapers is XIII Sqn, which was formally activated and commissioned on 26 October 2012. No. 39 Squadron personnel were planned to gradually return to the UK in 2013 and in time both squadrons would each operate five Reapers from RAF Waddington. In April 2013, XIII squadron started full operations from RAF Waddington, exercising control over a complement of 10 Reapers, at that point all based in Afghanistan. Five Reapers can provide 36 hours of combined surveillance coverage in Afghanistan with individual sorties lasting up to 16 hours; a further five vehicles increases this to 72 hours. In total, RAF Reapers flew 71,000 flight hours in Afghanistan, and dropped 510 guided weapons (compared to 497 for Harrier and Tornado). In April 2013, it was revealed that the MOD was studying the adoption of MBDA's Brimstone missile upon the MQ-9. In December 2013, several successful test firings of the Brimstone missile from a Reaper at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake to support integration onto RAF Reapers. Nine missiles were fired at an altitude of 20,000 ft at distances of from the targets; all nine scored direct hits against static, accelerating, weaving, and fast remotely controlled targets.\n\nIn 2014, the MOD decided that its Reaper fleet will be brought into the RAF's core fleet once operations over Afghanistan cease. Procurement of the MQ-9A was via an urgent operational capability requirement and funded from the Treasury reserve, but induction into the core fleet will have them funded from the MoD's budget. The Reapers were retained for contingent purposes, mainly to perform intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), until its replacement enters service around 2018. On 4 October 2015 David Cameron announced that the RAF would replace its existing fleet of 10 Reapers with more than 20 of the \"latest generation of RPAS\", named as \"Protector\", In April 2016 document, the MoD revealed that Protector will be a version of the MQ-9B SkyGuardian, formally known as Certifiable Predator B (CPB), made to fly in European airspace, and will be acquired from 2018–2030. In July 2018, it was announced that this aircraft will be designated Protector RG Mk 1 in RAF service, and is to be delivered in 2023. \n\nOn 16 October 2014, the MOD announced the deployment of armed Reapers in Operation Shader, the UK's contribution to the United States-led military intervention against Islamic State, the first occasion the UK had used its Reapers outside Afghanistan. The number of aircraft out of the RAF's 10-plane fleet was not disclosed, but it was expected that at least two were sent; more were dispatched as the UK drew down from Afghanistan. RAF Reapers' primary purpose is to provide surveillance support and situational awareness to coalition forces. On 10 November 2014, the MoD reported that an RAF Reaper had conducted its first airstrike against Islamic State forces, firing a Hellfire missile at militants placing an IED near Bayji. RAF Reapers based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus conducted one surveillance mission over Syria in November 2014, four in December 2014, and eight in January 2015. On 7 September 2015, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that two Islamic State fighters from Britain had been killed in an intelligence-led strike by an RAF Reaper near Raqqa, Syria, the first armed use of RAF assets in Syria during the civil war. By January 2016, RAF Reapers had flown 1,000 sorties in support of Operation Shader. Compared to operations in Afghanistan, where RAF Reapers fired 16 Hellfire missiles in 2008, 93 in 2013, and 94 in 2014, in operations against ISIL 258 Hellfires were fired in 2015.\n\nIn June 2017, the US State Department approved the sale of 22 drones to India, costing around 2-3 billion USD.\n\nIn January 2018, the Belgian Ministry of Defence reportedly decided on the MQ-9 to fulfill its medium-altitude long-range UAV requirement. Ministry officials stated that a request for information had been sent to potential suppliers of the system, and that they had received responses from all of them. In October 2018, Belgium confirmed its selection of the MQ-9B SkyGuardian variant, adding that it would be considered a \"reconnaissance\" asset, suggesting it will not be used to carry weapons.\n\nA navalised Reaper, named \"Mariner\", was proposed for the U.S. Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) program. It had an increased fuel capacity for an endurance of up to 49 hours. Variations included one for aircraft carrier operations with folding wings for storage, shortened, reinforced landing gear, an arresting hook, cut-down or eliminated ventral flight surfaces and six stores pylons for a total load of 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms). The Northrop Grumman RQ-4N was selected as the BAMS winner.\n\nThe US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates two maritime variants of the MQ-9, known as \"Guardians\". The U.S. Coast Guard evaluated the Guardian, including performing joint operations with CBP. The CBP and the Coast Guard operate one MQ-9 Guardian jointly out of land-based stations in Florida and Texas.\n\nGeneral Atomics hopes to test a sonobuoy launch capability from the Guardian in 2016 to demonstrate its ability to carry them, control them, and send information back to the ground station over a SATCOM link.\n\nOn 24 May 2012, General Atomics conducted the successful first flight of its upgraded MQ-9 Block 1-plus Reaper. The Block 1–plus version was designed for increased electrical power, secure communications, automatic landing, increased gross takeoff weight (GTOW), weapons growth, and streamlined payload integration capabilities. A new high-capacity starter generator offers increased electrical power capacity to provide growth capacity; a backup generator is also present and is sufficient for all flight-critical functions, improving the electrical power system's reliability via three independent power sources. New communications capabilities, including dual ARC-210 VHF/UHF radios with wingtip antennas, allow for simultaneous communications between multiple air-to-air and air-to-ground parties, secure data links, and an increased data transmission capacity. The new trailing arm main landing gear allows the carriage of heavier payloads or additional fuel. Development and testing were completed, and Milestone C was achieved in September 2012. Follow-on aircraft will be redesignated \"MQ-9 Block 5\". On 15 October 2013, the USAF awarded General Atomics a $377.4 million contract for 24 MQ-9 Block 5 Reapers. The MQ-9 Block 5 flew its first combat mission on 23 June 2017.\n\nInternational demand for a MALE RPAS capable of being certified for operation within civilian airspace drove General Atomics to develop a version of the platform known by GA-ASI as \"SkyGuardian\", previously called Certifiable Predator B, in order to make it compliant with European flight regulations to get more sales in European countries. In order to fly over national airspace, the aircraft meets NATO STANAG 4671 airworthiness requirements with lightning protection, different composite materials, and sense and avoid technology; performance changes include a wingspan that has winglets and enough fuel for a 40-hour endurance at . Features include High Definition EO/IR Full Motion Video sensor, De/Anti-Icing System, TCAS and Automatic Take-Off & Land. The system also includes a completely redesigned & modernized integrated ground control station with 4 crew stations.\n\nThe \"SeaGuardian\" is a proposed version of SkyGuardian but also fitted with Multimode 360 Maritime Surface Search Radar and Automatic identification system (AIS).\n\nIn April 2016, the United Kingdom announced that it intended to place an order for the Certifiable Predator B as part of its Protector MALE UAV programme for the Royal Air Force. According to the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Royal Air Force will operate at least 20 Protector systems by 2025, replacing all of its current 10 MQ-9A Reapers.\n\nOn 15 July 2018, a GA-ASI Company owned MQ-9B SkyGuardian was flown from the United States to RAF Fairford in the UK for the first transatlantic flight of a MALE UAV. It is to be displayed at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) air show where the aircraft was given RAF Markings of No. 31 Squadron RAF. This follows an announcement by the RAF's Chief of Air Staff that 31 Sqn would be the 1st RAF Squadron to operate a similar version of the MQ-9B aircraft, to be known as the Protector RG Mark 1, starting in 2023.\n\nProtector will be able to carry up to 18 Brimstone missiles.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "867894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=867894", "title": "Glozel", "text": "Glozel\n\nGlozel () is a hamlet in central France, part of the commune of Ferrières-sur-Sichon, Le Mayet-de-Montagne, Allier, some 17 km from Vichy.\n\nGlozel is probably best known as the place where, from 1924 to 1930, over 3,000 artifacts were discovered, including clay tablets, sculptures and vases, some of which were inscribed with symbols or letters.\n\nVariously dated to at times Neolithic, Iron Age and Medieval times, the finds initiated a series of claims, counterclaims and heated debates among archaeologists. The objects were all initially dismissed as a hoax. Later research confirmed that some of the items date back to the iron age. After further analysis and dating, the French Ministry of Culture released a report in 1995 which concluded that the site was medieval and later but also contained Iron Age artifacts. It also stated that the site included forgeries, author unknown.\n\nThe initial discovery was made on 1 March 1924 by 17-year-old Émile Fradin (born August 8, 1906, died February 10, 2010 age 103 ) and his grandfather Claude Fradin. Émile was guiding a cow-drawn plow when the cow's foot became stuck in a cavity. Freeing the cow, the Fradins uncovered an underground chamber, with walls of clay bricks and 16 clay floor tiles, containing human bones and ceramic fragments.\n\nAdrienne Picandet, a local teacher, visited the Fradins' farm in March, and afterwards informed the Minister of Education about the site. On July 9, another teacher, Benoit Clément, visited the Fradins representing the Société d'Émulation du Bourbonnais, later returning with a man called Viple. Clément and Viple used pickaxes to break down the chamber's remaining walls, which they took away with them. Later, Viple wrote to Émile Fradin identifying the site as Gallo-Roman, dating to between about A.D 100-400, and possibly of archeological importance. The January issue of the \"Bulletin de la Société d'Émulation du Bourbonnais\" mentioned the finds, intriguing Antonin Morlet, a Vichy physician and amateur archaeologist. Morlet visited the farm on 26 April, offering 200 francs to be allowed to complete the excavation. Morlet began his excavations on 24 May 1925, discovering tablets, idols, bone and flint tools and engraved stones. Morlet identified the site as Neolithic in a report entitled \"Nouvelle Station Néolithique\" published in September 1925, with Émile Fradin listed as co-author.\n\nTwo other tombs were uncovered in 1927. More excavations were performed in April 1928. After 1941, a new law outlawed private excavations, and the site remained untouched until the Ministry of Culture re-opened excavations in 1983. The full report was never published, but a 13-page summary appeared in 1995. The authors suggest that the site is medieval (roughly A.D. 500–1500), possibly containing some earlier Iron Age objects, but was likely enriched by forgeries. A group of scholars organized by René Germain held an annual colloquium about Glozel in Vichy from 1996 to 2009.\n\nFrench archaeological academia was dismissive of Morlet's 1925 report, published by an amateur and a peasant boy. Morlet invited a number of archaeologists to visit the site during 1926, including Salomon Reinach, curator of the National Museum of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, who spent three days excavating. Reinach confirmed the authenticity of the site in a communication to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Similarly, famous archaeologist Abbé Breuil excavated with Morlet and was impressed with the site, but on 2 October, Breuil wrote that \"everything is false except the stoneware pottery\".\n\nAt the meeting of the International Institute of Anthropology in Amsterdam, held in September 1927, Glozel was the subject of heated controversy. A commission was appointed for further investigation, arriving at Glozel on 5 November 1927. During their three-day excavation campaign, the archaeologists were observed by spectators, who were by now flocking to the site, finding various artifacts, but in their report of December 1927, the commission declared everything at Glozel with the exception of a few pieces of flint axes and stone were fake. René Dussaud, curator at the Louvre and famous epigrapher, also accused Émile Fradin of forgery. On 8 January 1928, Fradin filed suit for defamation against Dussaud.\n\nFelix Regnault, the president of the French Prehistoric Society, visited Glozel on 24 February 1928. After briefly visiting the site's small museum, he filed a complaint of fraud. On 25 February, the police, under the direction of Regnault, searched the museum, destroyed glass display cases and confiscated three cases of artifacts. On 28 February the suit against Dussaud was postponed due to Regnault's pending indictment against Fradin. A new group of neutral archaeologists, called the Committee of Studies, was appointed by scholars who were uncomfortable with the ongoing controversy. \n\nExcavating from 12 to 14 April 1928, they found more artifacts, and in their report asserted the authenticity of the site, which they identified as Neolithic. Gaston-Edmond Bayle, chief of the Criminal Records Office in Paris, analyzed the confiscated artifacts. Bayle's report identified the artifacts as recent forgeries, and on 4 June 1929, Émile Fradin was indicted for fraud on the basis of Bayle's report. The verdict against Fradin was reverted by an appeal court in April 1931. The defamation charge against Dussaud came to trial in March 1932, and Dussaud was found guilty of defamation.\n\nGlass found at Glozel was dated spectrographically in the 1920s, and again in the 1990s at the SLOWPOKE reactor at the University of Toronto by neutron activation analysis. Both analyses place the glass fragments in the medieval period. Alice and Sam Gerard together with Robert Liris in 1995 managed to have two bone tubes found in Tomb II C-14 dated at the AMS C-14 laboratory at the University of Arizona, finding a 13th-century date.\n\nThermoluminescence dating (TL) of Glozel pottery in 1974 confirmed that the pottery was not produced recently.By 1979, 39 TL dates on 27 artifacts separated the artifacts into three groups: the first between 300 BC and 300 AD (Celtic and Roman Gaul), the second medieval, centered on the 13th century, and the third recent. TL datings of 1983 performed in Oxford range from the 4th century to the medieval period.\n\nCarbon-14 datings of bone fragments range from the 13th to the 20th century. Three C-14 analyses performed in Oxford in 1984 dated a piece of charcoal to the 11th to 13th century, and a fragment of an ivory ring to the 15th century. A human femur was dated to the 5th century.\n\nSome 100 ceramic tablets bearing inscriptions are among the artefacts found at Glozel. The inscriptions are, on average, on six or seven lines, mostly on a single side, although some specimens are inscribed on both faces.\n\nThe symbols on the tablets are reminiscent of the Phoenician alphabet, but they have not been conclusively deciphered. There were numerous claims of decipherment, including identification of the language of the inscriptions as Basque, Chaldean, Eteocretan, Hebrew, Iberian, Latin, Berber, Ligurian, Phoenician and Turkic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "82583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82583", "title": "Golden Age of Radio", "text": "Golden Age of Radio\n\nThe old-time radio era, sometimes referred to as the Golden Age of Radio, was an era of radio programming in the United States during which radio was the dominant electronic home entertainment medium. It began with the birth of commercial radio broadcasting in the early 1920s and lasted through the 1940s, when television gradually superseded radio as the medium of choice for scripted programming, variety and dramatic shows. There were few U.S. network attempts at major scripted radio dramas after the end of several long-running dramatic series in 1962, including \"Suspense\" and \"Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\". \n\nRadio was the first broadcast medium, and people regularly tuned-in to their favorite radio programs, and families gathered to listen to the home radio in the evening. According to a 1947 C. E. Hooper survey, 82 out of 100 Americans were found to be radio listeners. A variety of new entertainment formats and genres were created for the new medium, many of which later migrated to television: radio plays, mystery serials, soap operas, quiz shows, talent shows, daytime and evening variety hours, situation comedies, play-by-play sports, children's shows, cooking shows, and more. \n\nSince this golden era, American commercial radio programming has shifted to more narrow formats of news, talk, sports and music. Religious broadcasters, listener-supported public radio and college stations provide their own distinctive formats. \n\nThe broadcasts of live drama, comedy, music and news that characterize the Golden Age of Radio had a precedent in the Théâtrophone, commercially introduced in Paris in 1890 and available as late as 1932. It allowed subscribers to eavesdrop on live stage performances and hear news reports by means of a network of telephone lines. The development of radio eliminated the wires and subscription charges from this concept.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1906, Reginald Fessenden is said to have broadcast the first radio program, consisting of some violin playing and passages from the Bible. While Fessenden's role as an inventor and early radio experimenter is not in dispute, several contemporary radio researchers have questioned whether the Christmas Eve broadcast took place, or whether the date was in fact several weeks earlier. The first apparent published reference to the event was made in 1928 by H.P. Davis, Vice President of Westinghouse, in a lecture given at Harvard University. In 1932 Fessenden cited the Christmas Eve 1906 broadcast event in a letter he wrote to Vice President S.M. Kinter of Westinghouse. Fessenden's wife Helen recounts the broadcast in her book \"Fessenden: Builder of Tomorrows\" (1940), eight years after Fessenden's death. The issue of whether the 1906 Fessenden broadcast actually happened is discussed in Donna Halper's article \"In Search of the Truth About Fessenden\" and also in James O'Neal's essays. An annotated argument supporting Fessenden as the world's first radio broadcaster was offered in 2006 by Dr. John S. Belrose, Radioscientist Emeritus at the Communications Research Centre Canada, in his essay \"Fessenden's 1906 Christmas Eve broadcast.\"\n\nIt was not until after the \"Titanic\" catastrophe in 1912 that radio for mass communication came into vogue, inspired first by the work of amateur (\"ham\") radio operators. Radio was especially important during World War I as it was vital for air and naval operations. World War I brought about major developments in radio, superseding the Morse code of the wireless telegraph with the vocal communication of the wireless telephone, through advancements in vacuum tube technology and the introduction of the transceiver.\n\nAfter the war, numerous radio stations were born in the United States and set the standard for later radio programs. The first radio news program was broadcast on August 31, 1920 on the station 8MK in Detroit; owned by \"The Detroit News\", the station covered local election results. This was followed in 1920 with the first commercial radio station in the United States, KDKA, being established in Pittsburgh. The first regular entertainment programs were broadcast in 1922, and on March 10, \"Variety\" carried the front-page headline: \"Radio Sweeping Country: 1,000,000 Sets in Use.\" A highlight of this time was the first Rose Bowl being broadcast on January 1, 1923 on the Los Angeles station KHJ.\n\nSeveral radio networks broadcast in the United States, airing programs nationwide. Their distribution made the \"golden age of radio\" possible. The networks declined in the early 1960s; Mutual and NBC's parent companies both closed down their radio operations in the 1990s, while ABC lasted until 2007 when it was bought by Citadel Broadcasting, which was in turn merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. As of November 14, 2013, Mutual, ABC and NBC's radio assets now reside with Cumulus Media's Westwood One division through numerous mergers and acquisitions since the mid-1980s, with ABC maintaining a limited radio ownership presence. CBS's radio license assets were folded into Entercom in 2017, with CBS shareholders acquiring a stake in that company as part of the reorganization. NBC, CBS and ABC now produce content for radio through their television divisions; the Mutual name was retired in 1999; the network has since been dismantled, with what few stations remaining under common ownership being owned by iHeartMedia.\n\nThe major networks were:\n\nDuring the Golden Age of Radio, new forms of entertainment were created for the new medium, which later migrated to television and other media: radio plays, mystery, adventure and detective serials, soap operas, quiz shows, variety hours, talent shows, situation comedies, children's shows, as well as live musical concerts and play by play sports broadcasts. In addition, the capability of the new medium to get information to people created the format of modern radio news: headlines, remote reporting, sidewalk interviews (such as \"Vox Pop\"), panel discussions, weather reports, farm reports.\nThe earliest radio programs of the 1920s were largely unsponsored; radio stations were a service designed to sell radio receivers. By the late 1920s, radio had reached critical mass and saturated the market, necessitating a change in business model. The sponsored musical feature soon became most popular program format. Most early radio sponsorship came in the form of selling the naming rights to the program, as evidenced by such programs as \"The A&P Gypsies\", \"Champion Spark Plug Hour\", \"The Clicquot Club Eskimos\", and \"King Biscuit Time\"; commercials as they are known in the modern era were still relatively uncommon and considered intrusive. During the 1930s and 1940s, the leading orchestras were heard often through big band remotes, and NBC's \"Monitor\" continued such remotes well into the 1950s by broadcasting live music from New York City jazz clubs to rural America.\n\nClassical music programs on the air included \"The Voice of Firestone\" and \"The Bell Telephone Hour\". Texaco sponsored the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts; the broadcasts, now sponsored by the Toll Brothers, continue to this day around the world, and are one of the few examples of live classical music still broadcast on radio. One of the most notable of all classical music radio programs of the Golden Age of Radio featured the celebrated Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra, which had been created especially for him. At that time, nearly all classical musicians and critics considered Toscanini the greatest living maestro. Popular songwriters such as George Gershwin were also featured on radio. (Gershwin, in addition to frequent appearances as a guest, also had his own program in 1934.) The New York Philharmonic also had weekly concerts on radio. There was no dedicated classical music radio station like NPR at that time, so classical music programs had to share the network they were broadcast on with more popular ones, much as in the days of television before the creation of NET and PBS.\n\nCountry music also enjoyed popularity. \"National Barn Dance\", begun on Chicago's WLS in 1924, was picked up by NBC Radio in 1933. In 1925, \"WSM Barn Dance\" went on the air from Nashville. It was renamed the \"Grand Ole Opry\" in 1927 and NBC carried portions from 1944 to 1956. NBC also aired \"The Red Foley Show\" from 1951 to 1961, and ABC Radio carried \"Ozark Jubilee\" from 1953 to 1961.\n\nRadio attracted top comedy talents from vaudeville and Hollywood for many years: Abbott and Costello, Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Victor Borge, Fanny Brice, Billie Burke, Bob Burns, Judy Canova, Eddie Cantor, Jimmy Durante, Phil Harris, Bob Hope, Groucho Marx, Jean Shepherd, Red Skelton and Ed Wynn. Situational comedies also gained popularity, such as \"Amos 'n' Andy\", \"Burns and Allen\", \"Easy Aces\", \"Ethel and Albert\", \"Fibber McGee and Molly\", \"The Goldbergs\", \"The Great Gildersleeve\", \"The Halls of Ivy\" (which featured screen star Ronald Colman and his wife Benita Hume), \"Meet Corliss Archer\", \"Meet Millie\", and \"Our Miss Brooks\".\n\nRadio comedy ran the gamut from the small town humor of Lum and Abner, Herb Shriner and Minnie Pearl to the dialect characterizations of Mel Blanc and the caustic sarcasm of Henry Morgan. Gags galore were delivered weekly on \"Stop Me If You've Heard This One\" and \"Can You Top This?\", panel programs devoted to the art of telling jokes. Quiz shows were lampooned on \"It Pays to Be Ignorant\", and other memorable parodies were presented by such satirists as Spike Jones, Stoopnagle and Budd, Stan Freberg and Bob and Ray. British comedy reached American shores in a major assault when NBC carried \"The Goon Show\" in the mid-1950s.\nSome shows originated as stage productions: Clifford Goldsmith's play \"What a Life\" was reworked into NBC's popular, long-running \"The Aldrich Family\" (1939–1953) with the familiar catchphrases \"Henry! Henry Aldrich!,\" followed by Henry's answer, \"Coming, Mother!\" Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman's Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway hit, \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1936), became a weekly situation comedy heard on Mutual (1944) with Everett Sloane and later on NBC (1951) with Walter Brennan.\n\nOther shows were adapted from comic strips, such as \"Blondie\", \"Dick Tracy\", \"Gasoline Alley\", \"The Gumps\", \"Li'l Abner\", \"Little Orphan Annie\", \"Popeye the Sailor\", \"Red Ryder\", \"Reg'lar Fellers\", \"Terry and the Pirates\" and \"Tillie the Toiler\". Bob Montana's redheaded teen of comic strips and comic books was heard on radio's \"Archie Andrews\" from 1943 to 1953. \"The Timid Soul\" was a 1941–1942 comedy based on cartoonist H. T. Webster's famed Caspar Milquetoast character, and Robert L. Ripley's Believe It or Not! was adapted to several different radio formats during the 1930s and 1940s. Conversely, some radio shows gave rise to spinoff comic strips, such as \"My Friend Irma\" starring Marie Wilson.\n\nThe first soap opera, \"Clara, Lu, and Em\" was introduced in 1930 on Chicago's WGN. When daytime serials began in the early 1930s, they became known as soap operas because many were sponsored by soap products and detergents. The line-up of late afternoon adventure serials included \"Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders\", \"The Cisco Kid\", \"Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy\", \"Captain Midnight\", and \"The Tom Mix Ralston Straight Shooters\". Badges, rings, decoding devices and other radio premiums offered on these adventure shows were often allied with a sponsor's product, requiring the young listeners to mail in a boxtop from a breakfast cereal or other proof of purchase.\n\nRadio dramas were presented on such programs as \"26 by Corwin\", \"NBC Short Story\", \"Arch Oboler's Plays\", \"Quiet, Please\", and \"CBS Radio Workshop\". Orson Welles's \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" and \"The Campbell Playhouse\" were considered by many critics to be the finest radio drama anthologies ever presented. They usually starred Welles in the leading role, along with celebrity guest stars such as Margaret Sullavan or Helen Hayes, in adaptations from literature, Broadway, and/or films. They included such titles as \"Liliom\", \"Oliver Twist\" (a title now feared lost), \"A Tale of Two Cities\", \"Lost Horizon\", and \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\". It was on \"Mercury Theatre\" that Welles presented his celebrated-but-infamous 1938 adaptation of H. G. Wells's \"The War of the Worlds\", formatted to sound like a breaking news program. \"Theatre Guild on the Air\" presented adaptations of classical and Broadway plays. Their Shakespeare adaptations included a one-hour \"Macbeth\" starring Maurice Evans and Judith Anderson, and a 90-minute \"Hamlet\", starring John Gielgud. Recordings of many of these programs survive.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, famous for playing Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in films, repeated their characterizations on radio on \"The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\", which featured both original stories and episodes directly adapted from Arthur Conan Doyle's stories. None of the episodes in which Rathbone and Bruce starred on the radio program were filmed with the two actors as Holmes and Watson, so radio became the only medium in which audiences were able to experience Rathbone and Bruce appearing in some of the more famous Holmes stories, such as \"The Speckled Band\". There were also many dramatizations of Sherlock Holmes stories on radio without Rathbone and Bruce.\n\nDuring the latter part of his career, celebrated actor John Barrymore starred in a radio program, \"Streamlined Shakespeare\", which featured him in a series of one-hour adaptations of Shakespeare plays, many of which Barrymore never appeared in either on stage or in films, such as \"Twelfth Night\" (in which he played both Malvolio and Sir Toby Belch), and \"Macbeth\".\n\n\"Lux Radio Theatre\" and \"The Screen Guild Theater\" presented adaptations of Hollywood movies, performed before a live audience, usually with cast members from the original films. \"Suspense\", \"Escape\", \"The Mysterious Traveler\" and \"Inner Sanctum Mystery\" were popular thriller anthology series. Leading writers who created original material for radio included Norman Corwin, Carlton E. Morse, David Goodis, Archibald MacLeish, Arthur Miller, Arch Oboler, Wyllis Cooper, Rod Serling, Jay Bennett, and Irwin Shaw.\n\nThe RCA 44BX microphone had two live faces and two dead ones. Thus actors could face each other and react. An actor could give the effect of leaving the room by simply moving his head toward the dead face of the microphone. The scripts were paper-clipped together. It has been disputed whether or not actors and actresses would drop finished pages to the carpeted floor after use.\n\nIn the beginning of the Golden Age, American radio network programs were almost exclusively broadcast live, as the national networks prohibited the airing of recorded programs until the late 1940s because of the inferior sound quality of phonograph discs, the only practical recording medium. As a result, prime-time shows would be performed twice, once for each coast. However, \"reference recordings\" were made of many programs as they were being broadcast, for review by the sponsor and for the network's own archival purposes. With the development of high-fidelity magnetic wire and tape recording in the years following World War II, the networks became more open to airing recorded programs and the prerecording of shows became more common.\n\nLocal stations, however, had always been free to use recordings and sometimes made substantial use of prerecorded syndicated programs distributed on pressed (as opposed to individually recorded) transcription discs.\n\nRecording was done using a cutting lathe and acetate discs. Programs were normally recorded at 33 rpm on 16 inch discs, the standard format used for such \"electrical transcriptions\" from the early 1930s through the 1950s. Sometimes, the groove was cut starting at the inside of the disc and running to the outside. This was useful when the program to be recorded was longer than 15 minutes so required more than one disc side. By recording the first side outside in, the second inside out, and so on, the sound quality at the disc change-over points would match and result in a more seamless playback. An inside start also had the advantage that the thread of material cut from the disc's surface, which had to be kept out of the path of the cutting stylus, was naturally thrown toward the center of the disc so was automatically out of the way. When cutting an outside start disc, a brush could be used to keep it out of the way by sweeping it toward the middle of the disc. Well-equipped recording lathes used the vacuum from a water aspirator to pick it up as it was cut and deposit it in a water-filled bottle. In addition to convenience, this served a safety purpose, as the cellulose nitrate thread was highly flammable and a loose accumulation of it combusted violently if ignited.\n\nMost recordings of radio broadcasts were made at a radio network's studios, or at the facilities of a network-owned or affiliated station, which might have four or more lathes. A small local station often had none. Two lathes were required to capture a program longer than 15 minutes without losing parts of it while discs were flipped over or changed, along with a trained technician to operate them and monitor the recording while it was being made. However, some surviving recordings were produced by local stations.\n\nWhen a substantial number of copies of an electrical transcription were required, as for the distribution of a syndicated program, they were produced by the same process used to make ordinary records. A master recording was cut, then electroplated to produce a stamper from which pressings in vinyl (or, in the case of transcription discs pressed before about 1935, shellac) were molded in a record press.\n\nThe Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) had its origins in the U.S. War Department's quest to improve troop morale. This quest began with short-wave broadcasts of educational and information programs to troops in 1940. In 1941, the War Department began issuing \"Buddy Kits\" (B-Kits) to departing troops, which consisted of radios, 78 rpm records and electrical transcription discs of radio shows. However, with the entrance of the United States into World War II, the War Department decided that it needed to improve the quality and quantity of its offerings.\n\nThis began with the broadcasting of its own original variety programs. \"Command Performance\" was the first of these, produced for the first time on March 1, 1942. On May 26, 1942, the Armed Forces Radio Service was formally established. Originally, its programming comprised network radio shows with the commercials removed. However, it soon began producing original programming, such as \"Mail Call\", \"G.I. Journal\", \"Jubilee\" and \"GI Jive\". At its peak in 1945, the Service produced around 20 hours of original programming each week. \n\nFrom 1943 until 1949 the AFRS also broadcast programs developed through the collaborative efforts of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and the Columbia Broadcasting System in support of America's cultural diplomacy initiatives and President Franklin Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy. Included among the popular shows was \"Viva America\" which showcased leading musical artists from both North and South America for the entertainment of America's troops. Included among the regular performers were: Alfredo Antonini, Juan Arvizu, Nestor Mesta Chayres and John Serry Sr. \n\nAfter the war, the AFRS continued providing programming to troops in Europe. During the 1950s and early 1960s it presented performances by the Army's only symphonic orchestra ensemble - the Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra.\nIn addition, it also provided programming for future wars that the United States was involved in. It survives today as a component of the American Forces Network (AFN).\n\nAll of the shows aired by the AFRS during the Golden Age were recorded as electrical transcription discs, vinyl copies of which were shipped to stations overseas to be broadcast to the troops. People in the United States rarely ever heard programming from the AFRS, though AFRS recordings of Golden Age network shows were occasionally broadcast on some domestic stations beginning in the 1950s.\n\nIn some cases, the AFRS disc is the only surviving recordingof a program.\n\nThere was some home recording of radio broadcasts in the 1930s and 1940s. Examples from as early as 1930 have been documented. During these years, home recordings were made with disc recorders, most of which were only capable of storing about four minutes of a radio program on each side of a twelve-inch 78 rpm record. Most home recordings were made on even shorter-playing ten-inch or smaller discs. Some home disc recorders offered the option of the 33 rpm speed used for electrical transcriptions, allowing a recording more than twice as long to be made, although with reduced audio quality. Office dictation equipment was sometimes pressed into service for making recordings of radio broadcasts, but the audio quality of these devices was poor and the resulting recordings were in odd formats which had to be played back on similar equipment. Due to the expense of recorders and the limitations of the recording media, home recording of broadcasts was not common during this period and it was usually limited to brief excerpts.\n\nThe lack of suitable home recording equipment was somewhat relieved in 1947 with the availability of magnetic wire recorders for domestic use. These were capable of recording an hour-long broadcast on a single small spool of wire, and if a high-quality radio's audio output was recorded directly, rather than by holding a microphone up to its speaker, the recorded sound quality was very good. However, because the wire cost money and, like magnetic tape, could be repeatedly re-used to make new recordings, only a few complete broadcasts appear to have survived on this medium. In fact, there was little home recording of complete radio programs until the early 1950s, when increasingly affordable reel-to-reel tape recorders for home use were introduced to the market.\n\nBefore the early 1950s, when radio networks and local stations wanted to preserve a live broadcast, they did so by means of special phonograph records known as \"electrical transcriptions\" (ETs), made by cutting a sound-modulated groove into a blank disc. At first, in the early 1930s, the blanks varied in both size and composition, but most often they were simply bare aluminum and the groove was indented rather than cut. Typically, these very early recordings were not made by the network or radio station, but by a private recording service contracted by the broadcast sponsor or one of the performers. The bare aluminum discs were typically 10 or 12 inches in diameter and recorded at the then-standard speed of 78 rpm, which meant that several disc sides were required to accommodate even a 15-minute program. By about 1936, 16-inch aluminum-based discs coated with cellulose nitrate lacquer, commonly known as acetates and recorded at a speed of 33 rpm, had been adopted by the networks and individual radio stations as the standard medium for recording broadcasts. The making of such recordings, at least for some purposes, then became routine. Some discs were recorded using a \"hill and dale\" vertically modulated groove, rather than the \"lateral\" side-to-side modulation found on the records being made for home use at that time. The large slow-speed discs could easily contain fifteen minutes on each side, allowing an hour-long program to be recorded on only two discs. The lacquer was softer than shellac or vinyl and wore more rapidly, allowing only a few playbacks with the heavy pickups and steel needles then in use before deterioration became audible.\n\nDuring World War II, aluminum became a necessary material for the war effort and was in short supply. This caused an alternative to be sought for the base on which to coat the lacquer. Glass, despite its obvious disadvantage of fragility, had occasionally been used in earlier years because it could provide a perfectly smooth and even supporting surface for mastering and other critical applications. Glass base recording blanks came into general use for the duration of the war.\n\nIn the late 1940s, wire recorders became a readily obtainable means of recording radio programs. On a per-minute basis, it was less expensive to record a broadcast on wire than on discs. The one-hour program that required the four sides of two 16-inch discs could be recorded intact on a single spool of wire less than three inches in diameter and about half an inch thick. The audio fidelity of a good wire recording was comparable to acetate discs and by comparison the wire was practically indestructible, but it was soon rendered obsolete by the more manageable and easily edited medium of magnetic tape.\n\nBing Crosby became the first major proponent of magnetic tape recording for radio, and he was the first to use it on network radio, after he did a demonstration program in 1947. Tape had several advantages over earlier recording methods. Running at a sufficiently high speed, it could achieve higher fidelity than both electrical transcription discs and magnetic wire. Discs could be edited only by copying parts of them to a new disc, and the copying entailed a loss of audio quality. Wire could be divided up and the ends spliced together by knotting, but wire was difficult to handle and the crude splices were too noticeable. Tape could be edited by cutting it with a blade and neatly joining ends together with adhesive tape. By early 1949, the transition from live performances preserved on discs to performances prerecorded on magnetic tape for later broadcast was complete for network radio programs. However, for the physical distribution of prerecorded programming to individual stations, 16-inch 33 rpm vinyl pressings, less expensive to produce in quantities of identical copies than tapes, continued to be standard throughout the 1950s.\n\nThe great majority of pre-World War II live radio broadcasts, many never recorded at all, have not been preserved; most of the oldest existing radio program recordings date to the early 1930s, and several of the longer-running radio dramas have their archives complete or nearly complete back to that time. The earlier the date, the less likely it is that a recording of the broadcast was made and survives. A good number of prerecorded syndicated programs from this period have survived because copies of those were originally distributed far and wide. Recordings of live network broadcasts from the World War II years were preserved in the form of pressed vinyl copies issued by the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) and survive in relative abundance. Syndicated programs from World War II and later years have nearly all survived. The survival of network programming from this time frame is more inconsistent; the networks started prerecording their formerly live shows on magnetic tape for subsequent network broadcast, but did not physically distribute copies, and the tapes, unlike electrical transcription (\"ET\") discs, could be \"wiped\" and re-used (especially since, in the age of emerging trends such as television and music radio, such recordings were believed to have virtually no rerun or resale value). Thus, while some prime time network radio series from this era exist in full or almost in full, especially the most famous and longest-lived of them, less prominent or shorter-lived series (such as serials) may have only a handful of extant episodes. Airchecks, off-the-air recordings of complete shows made by, or at the behest of, individuals for their own private use, sometimes help to fill in such gaps. The contents of privately made recordings of live broadcasts from the first half of the 1930s can be of particular interest, as little live material from that period survives. Unfortunately, the sound quality of very early private recordings is often very poor, although in some cases this is largely due to the use of an incorrect playback stylus, which can also badly damage some unusual types of discs.\n\nMost of the Golden Age programs in circulation among collectors – whether on analog tape, CD, or in the form of MP3s – originated from 16-inch transcription discs. In many cases, the circulating recordings are several generations of analog reel-to-reel and cassette tape copies down the line from the original discs, being the product of tape-trading among collectors during the decades before lossless digital duplication was possible. The muffled sound, dropouts, sudden changes in sound quality, unsteady pitch and other defects heard all too often are almost always accumulated tape copy defects. The audio quality of the source discs, when they have survived unscathed and are accessed and dubbed anew, is usually found to be reasonably clear and undistorted, sometimes startlingly good, although like all phonograph records they are vulnerable to wear and the effects of scuffs, scratches and ground-in dust. Many shows from the 1940s have survived only in edited AFRS versions, although some exist in both the original and AFRS forms.\n\nUnlike film, television, and print items from the era, the copyright status of most recordings from the Golden Age of Radio is unclear. This is because, prior to 1972, the United States delegated the copyrighting of sound recordings to the individual states, many of which offered more generous common law copyright protections than the federal government offered for other media (some offered \"perpetual\" copyright, which has since been abolished; under the Music Modernization Act of September 2018, any sound recording 95 years old or older will be thrust into the public domain regardless of state law). The only exceptions are AFRS original productions, which are considered work of the United States government and thus both ineligible for federal copyright and outside the jurisdiction of any state; these programs are firmly in the public domain (this does not apply to programs carried by AFRS but produced by commercial networks).\n\nIn practice, most old-time radio recordings are treated as orphan works: although there may still be a valid copyright on the program, it is seldom enforced. The copyright on an individual sound recording is distinct from the federal copyright for the underlying material (such as a published script, music, or in the case of adaptations, the original film or television material), and in many cases it is impossible to determine where or when the original recording was made or if the recording was copyrighted in that state. The U.S. Copyright Office states \"there are a variety of legal regimes governing protection of pre-1972 sound recordings in the various states, and the scope of protection and of exceptions and limitations to that protection is unclear.\" For example, New York has issued contradicting rulings on whether or not common law exists in that state; the most recent ruling, 2016's \"Flo & Eddie, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio\", holds that there is no such copyright in New York in regard to public performance. Further complicating matters is that certain examples in case law have implied that radio broadcasts (and faithful reproductions thereof), because they were distributed freely to the public over the air, may not be eligible for copyright in and of themselves. The Internet Archive and other organizations that distribute public domain and open-source audio recordings maintain extensive archives of old-time radio programs.\n\nSome old-time radio shows continued on the air, although in ever-dwindling numbers, throughout the 1950s even after their television equivalents had conquered the general public. One factor which helped to kill them off entirely was the evolution of popular music (including the development of rock and roll), which led to the birth of the top 40 radio format. A top 40 show could be produced in a small studio in a local station with minimal staff. This displaced full-service network radio and hastened the end of virtually all scripted radio drama by 1962. (Radio in and of itself would survive, thanks in part to the proliferation of the transistor radio, and permanent installation in vehicles, making the medium far more portable than television.) Full-service stations that did not adopt either top 40 or the mellower beautiful music or MOR formats eventually developed all-news radio in the mid-1960s.\n\nScripted radio comedy and drama in the vein of old-time radio has a limited presence on U.S. radio. Several radio theatre series are still in production in the United States, usually airing on Sunday nights. These include original series such as \"Imagination Theater\" and a radio adaptation of \"The Twilight Zone\" TV series, as well as rerun compilations such as the popular daily series \"When Radio Was\" and USA Radio Network's \"Golden Age of Radio Theatre\", and weekly programs such as Ed Walker's \"The Big Broadcast\" on WAMU. These shows usually air in late nights and/or on weekends on small AM stations. Carl Amari's nationally syndicated radio show \"Hollywood 360\" features 6 old-time radio episodes each week during his 4-hour broadcast. Amari also broadcasts old-time radio shows on \"The WGN Radio Theatre\" heard every Saturday and Sunday night on 720-WGN in Chicago. Local rerun compilations are also heard, primarily on public radio stations. Sirius XM Radio maintains a full-time Radio Classics channel devoted to rebroadcasts of vintage radio shows.\n\nStarting in 1974, Garrison Keillor, through his syndicated two-hour-long program \"A Prairie Home Companion\", has provided a living museum of the production, tone and listener's experience of this era of radio for several generations after its demise. Produced live in theaters throughout the country, using the same sound effects and techniques of the era, it ran through 2016 with Keillor as host. The program includes segments that are close renditions (in the form of parody) of specific genres of this era, including Westerns (\"Dusty and Lefty, The Lives of the Cowboys\"), detective procedurals (\"Guy Noir, Private Eye\") and even advertising through fictional commercials. Keillor also wrote a novel, \"\" based on a radio station of this era—including a personally narrated version for the ultimate in verisimilitude. Upon Keillor's retirement, replacement host Chris Thile chose to reboot the show and eliminate much of the old-time radio trappings of the format.\n\nVintage shows and new audio productions in America are accessible more widely from recordings or by satellite and web broadcasters, rather than over conventional AM and FM radio. The National Audio Theatre Festival is a national organization and yearly conference keeping the audio arts - especially audio drama - alive, and continues to involve long-time voice actors and OTR veterans in its ranks. Its predecessor, the Midwest Radio Theatre Workshop, was first hosted by Jim Jordan, of \"Fibber McGee and Molly\" fame, and Norman Corwin advised the organization.\n\nOne of the longest running radio programs celebrating this era is \"The Golden Days of Radio\", which was hosted on the Armed Forces Radio Service for more than 20 years and overall for more than 50 years by Frank Bresee, who also played \"Little Beaver\" on the \"Red Ryder\" program as a child actor.\n\nOne of the very few still-running shows from the earlier era of radio is a Christian program entitled \"Unshackled!\" The weekly half-hour show, produced in Chicago by Pacific Garden Mission, has been continuously broadcast since 1950. The shows are created using techniques from the 1950s (including home-made sound effects) and are broadcast across the U.S. and around the world by thousands of radio stations.\n\nToday, radio performers of the past appear at conventions which feature re-creations of classic shows, as well as music, memorabilia and historical panels. The largest of these events was the Friends of Old Time Radio Convention, held in Newark, New Jersey which held its final convention in October 2011 after 36 years. Others include REPS in Seattle (June), SPERDVAC in California, the Cincinnati OTR & Nostalgia Convention (April), and the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention (September). Veterans of the Friends of Old Time Radio Convention, including Chairperson Steven M. Lewis of The Gotham Radio Players, Maggie Thompson, publisher of the \"Comic Book Buyer's Guide\", Craig Wichman of audio drama troupe Quicksilver Audio Theater and long-time FOTR Publicist Sean Dougherty have launched a successor event, Celebrating Audio Theater - Old & New, scheduled for October 12–13, 2012.\n\nRadio dramas from the golden age are sometimes recreated as live stage performances at such events. One such group, led by director Daniel Smith, has been performing re-creations of old-time radio dramas at Fairfield University's Regina A. Quick Center for the Arts since the year 2000.\n\nThe 40th anniversary of what is widely considered the end of the old time radio era (the final broadcasts of \"Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\" and \"Suspense\" on September 30, 1962) was marked with a commentary on NPR's \"All Things Considered\".\n\nA handful of radio programs from the old-time era remain in production, all from the genera of news or music: the \"Grand Ole Opry\" (1925), \"Music and the Spoken Word\" (1929), the \"CBS World News Roundup\" (1938), \"King Biscuit Time\" (1941) and the \"Renfro Valley Gatherin'\" (1943). Of those, all but the Opry maintain their original short-form length of 30 minutes or less. The \"Wheeling Jamboree\" counts an earlier program on a competing station as part of its history, tracing its lineage back to 1933.\n\nRegular broadcasts of radio plays are also heard in — among other countries — Australia, Croatia, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, and Sweden. In the United Kingdom, such scripted radio drama continues on BBC Radio 3 and (principally) BBC Radio 4, the second-most popular radio station in the country, as well as on the rerun channel BBC Radio 4 Extra, which is the seventh-most popular station there.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Based in England, she is well known for her theoretical and methodological innovation, combined with readings of historical and contemporary art, film and cultural theory. Since 1977, Pollock has been one of the most influential scholars of modern, avant-garde art, postmodern art, and contemporary art. She is also a major influence in feminist theory, feminist art history and gender studies.\n\nBorn in South Africa, Griselda Pollock grew up in both French and English Canada. Moving to Britain during her teens, Pollock studied Modern History at Oxford (1967–1970) and History of European Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art (1970–72). She received her doctorate in 1980 for a study of \"Vincent van Gogh and Dutch Art: A reading of his notions of the modern.\" After teaching at Reading and Manchester Universities, Pollock went to the University of Leeds in 1977 as Lecturer in History of Art and Film and was appointed to a Personal Chair in Social and Critical Histories of Art in 1990. In 2001 she became Director of Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History at the University of Leeds, where she is Professor of Social and Critical Histories of Art. In 2017 Pollock celebrated 40 years of creating 'a feminist space' at the School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies at the University of Leeds. \n\nGriselda Pollock is regarded as a feminist art historian and cultural theorist of art practices and art history. Her work challenges mainstream models of art and art history that have excluded the role of women in art, and at the same time explores the social structures that result in this exclusion. She examines the interaction of the social categories of gender, class and race, crucially researching the relationship between them and psychoanalysis and art, and drawing on the work of such French cultural theorists as Michel Foucault. Her theorization of subjectivity takes both psychoanalysis and Foucault's ideas about social control into account. She is known for her work on the artists Jean-François Millet, Vincent van Gogh, Mary Cassatt, Bracha L. Ettinger, Eva Hesse and Charlotte Salomon. and Alina Szapocznikow, Lubaina Himid, Sutapa Biswas, Christine Taylor Patten, Louise Bourgeois, Anna Maria Maiolino and Vera Frenkel. She has developed a range of concepts with which to theorise and practice critical feminist interventions in art's histories: old mistresses, vision and difference, avant-garde gambits, generations and geographies, differencing the canon and most recently, the virtual feminist museum.\n\nIn 2014 she was suggested by Michael Paraskos to the BBC to act as the presenter for a proposed remake of the 1969 television series \"Civilization\", a series originated by the art historian Kenneth Clark. Paraskos described Professor Pollock as 'one of the few academics around with the full breadth of knowledge of the sweep of art history.'\n\nGriselda Pollock is the founding director of the Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History at the University of Leeds. Initiated with a grant from the then AHRB in 2001, CentreCATH is a transdisciplinary project connecting fine art, histories of art and cultural studies across the shared engagements with class, gender, sexuality, post colonial critique and queer theory. Its five research themes are: social exclusion and hospitality, musicality/aurality/textuality, architecture and philosophy, virtuality and digitally, memoria/historia/amnesia. After its first five years in which CentreCATH organised seminars and conferences on and around these themes. 17 publications emerged from this project, many of which appear in the New Encounters: Arts, Cultures and Concepts series (I B Tauris). In 2007, with Max Silverman, Griselda Pollock won a second major grant for the project Concentrationary Memories: The Politics of Representation which explores the concept of an anxious and vigilant form of cultural memory analysing the devastating effects of the totalitarian assault on the human condition and alert to the persistent not only of this perpetual threat, but is invasion of popular culture in the form of a concentrationary imaginary. The project explored the forms of aesthetic resistance to totalitarian terror and the concentrationary imaginary. Four edited collections have been produced: Concentrationary Cinema, Concentrationary Memory, Concentrationary Imaginaries and forthcoming Concentrationary Art. The most recent CentreCATH project was a Leverhulme Visiting Professorship for Carilyn Christov Bakargiev which undertook a critical analysis of the Documenta exhibitions with special reference to dDOCUMENTA (13). CentreCATH has collaborated with Opera North on several projects and is currently engaged in a long-term project Performing Violence.\n\nShe is married to Antony Bryant.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the three towns in the Otavi Triangle, situated on the B8 national road that leads from Otavi to the Caprivi Strip. Grootfontein receives an annual average rainfall of , although in the 2010/2011 rainy season were measured.\n\nThe place was known to the Herero under the name \"Otjivanda\". In 1885, 40 Boer families from the north-west of South Africa settled at Grootfontein. Part of the Dorsland trekkers, they were heading towards Angola. When that territory fell under Portuguese control, they turned back and established the Republic of Upingtonia at Grootfontein. Abandoned by 1887, it became the headquarters of the South West Africa Company in 1893.\n\nIn 1908 the Roman Catholic church established a mission in Grootfontein as the basis of their eventually successful attempt to establish missions in Kavango.\n\nLike all the towns in the Otavi Triangle, Grootfontein is very green in summer but drier in winter. In spring, jacaranda and flamboyant trees bloom in profusion. The town has an old German Schutztruppe fortress from the year 1896, which today houses a museum that expounds on the local history. The economic mainspring of the area were for many decades the Berg Aukas and Abenab mines to the north east of the town. These produced zinc and vanadium but have since closed. This is dolomite country and the carbonate deposits in the upper parts of the mine have yielded interesting fossils of simian or pongoid creatures that lived millions of years before modern humans evolved.\n\nTwenty four kilometres west of Grootfontein lies the huge Hoba meteorite. At over 60 tons, it is the largest known meteorite on Earth, as well as being the largest naturally occurring mass of iron known to exist on the planet's surface.\n\nGrootfontein is a railhead on TransNamib, the national railway and transport system. The next station to the west is Otavi. Grootfontein is also home of Namibia's main military base which housed several units of the now departed South African Defence Force. It has an airfield that can handle large transport carriers such as the Hercules C130, as well as commercial passenger aircraft.\n\n\"Grootfontein Show\", an annual agricultural exhibition that takes place since 1911, is the second largest annual entrepreneurial exhibition in the country, after Windhoek Show.\n\nThe town has four supermarket chains (Spar, WB, Pick n Pay and Ok Foods), and a newly developed mall. Grootfontein is home to Namibia Property Group, a developer of low and middle income housing across the country. NPG is developing Omulunga Extension 5, and has plans to continue growing Grootfontein's inner township.\n\nGrootfontein is governed by a municipal council that has seven seats.\n\nThe 2015 local authority election was won by Namibia's ruling SWAPO party which gained five seats and 2,019 votes. One seat each went to the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 546 votes) and to the All People's Party (APP, 154 votes).\n\nThere is another Grootfontein in Hardap province.\nPreviously the German school Regierungsschule Grootfontein was in the town. In 1965 it had 4 teachers and 117 learners and was supported by German government.\n\nGrootfontein is home to four high schools, Grootfontein Secondary School, Otjiwanda High School Friedrich Awaseb Senior Secondary School, and the Grootfontein Agricultural College.\n\n\n"}

He is winner of the first Karachi Literature Festival (KLF) Award for best non fiction in English in 2011 and the winner of the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan's (HEC-P) Best Book Publication in Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities of 2010 Award.\n\nNiaz has completed all his post graduate work from Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad. He completed his MSc in history in 2003, M.Phil in 2004 and his PhD in 2009. The PhD thesis became the basis for his second book which won the KLF Award and the HEC Best Book Publication Award. He has been published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, www.foreignaffairs.com, and other leading international publications.\n\nIn his first book, \"An Inquiry into the Culture of Power of the Subcontinent\", Niaz developed a theoretical framework that explains the rise and fall of states in South Asia. The core elements of this framework are a type of the state (continental bureaucratic empire) that manifests three main properties in its organization. First, the state is the property of the ruler or the rulers. Second, the ruler(s) operate through hierarchical institutions (military, bureaucracy, priests). Third, they exercise power arbitrarily and due to the official ideology or religion are above lawful criticism. Niaz presents a macro-historical overview of South Asia from the Indus Valley Civilization to near-contemporary India and Pakistan and demonstrates the elements of continuity in the behavior of ruling elites over this period. He argues that since independence from Britain in 1947, India and Pakistan have slowly gone back to their primordial cultures of power that are delusional, arbitrary, ideocratic and treat the state as a personal estate. In his second book, \"The Culture of Power and Governance of Pakistan, 1947-2008\", Niaz provides a detailed study of Pakistan's experience of behavioral regression since 1947. The framework developed in the first book is applied and adjusted in light of the archival material found in Islamabad.\n\nNiaz's latest book, \"Old World Empires: Cultures of Power and Governance in Eurasia\", was published by Routledge, New York in April 2014, and is available in India and Pakistan in an Oxford University Press edition released in November 2014. In this book, Niaz advances the framework developed in his works on South Asia and Pakistan and applies it to India, China, Persia, Continental Europe, the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Niaz takes a long-view of historical development that combines deterministic factors such as geography and environment with variable factors such as leadership, politics, and ideology, to provide an overview of how states developed structurally and in terms of mentality. This is the first instance of a Pakistani historian developing a philosophical framework for understanding global macro-history.\n\nNiaz is currently (since 2009) assistant professor of history at Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) in Islamabad.

{"id": "46853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46853", "title": "Indus Valley Civilisation", "text": "Indus Valley Civilisation\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC), or Harappan Civilisation, was a Bronze Age civilisation (3300–1300 BCE; mature period 2600–1900 BCE) mainly in the northwestern regions of South Asia. Along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early cradles of civilisations of the Old World, and of the three, the most widespread. \n\nThe civilisation was primarily located in modern-day India (Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir states) and Pakistan (Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan provinces), while some sites in Afghanistan are believed to be trading colonies. A total of 1,022 cities and settlements had been found by 2008, mainly in the general region of the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra Rivers, and their tributaries; of which 616 sites are in India and 416 sites in Pakistan; of these 96 have been excavated. Among the settlements were the major urban centres of Harappa, Mohenjo-daro (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Dholavira, Ganeriwala and Rakhigarhi. \n\nAridification of this region during the 3rd millennium BCE may have been the initial spur for the urbanisation associated with the civilisation, but eventually also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation's demise, and to scatter its population eastward.\n\nAt its peak, the Indus Civilisation may have had a population of over five million inhabitants. The inhabitants of the ancient Indus River valley developed new techniques in handicraft (carnelian products, seal carving) and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and tin). The Indus cities are noted for their urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems, water supply systems, and clusters of large non-residential buildings. Children's toys were found in the cities, with few weapons of war, suggesting peace and prosperity. Their trade seals, decorated with animals and mythical beings, indicate they conducted thriving trade with lands as far away as Sumer in southern Mesopotamia.\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilisation is also named the \"Harappan Civilisation\" after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s (mainly 1921), in what was then the Punjab province of British India. The discovery of Harappa, and soon afterwards Mohenjo-daro, was the culmination of work beginning in 1861 with the founding of the Archaeological Survey of India in the British Raj. Excavation of Harappan sites has been ongoing since 1920, with important breakthroughs occurring as recently as 1999. This Harappan civilisation is sometimes called the Mature Harappan culture to distinguish it from the cultures immediately preceding and following it. Of these, the earlier is often called the Early Harappan culture, while the later one may be referred to as the Late Harappan, both of which existed in the same area as the Mature Harappan Civilisation. The early Harappan cultures were preceded by local Neolithic agricultural villages, from which the river plains were populated.\n\nThe Harappan language is not directly attested, and its affiliation is uncertain since the Indus script is still undeciphered. A relationship with the Dravidian or Elamo-Dravidian language family is favoured by a section of scholars.\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilisation was named after the Indus Valley, where the first remains were found. The Indus Valley Civilisation was also named as the \"Harappan civilisation\" after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s, in what was then the Punjab province of British India.\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilisation has also been called by some the \"Sarasvati culture\", the \"Sarasvati Civilisation\", the \"Indus-Sarasvati Civilisation\" or the \"Sindhu-Saraswati Civilisation\", as the Ghaggar-Hakra river is identified by some with the mythological Sarasvati River, suggesting that the Indus Valley Civilisation was the Vedic civilisation as perceived by traditional Hindu beliefs.\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) encompassed much of Pakistan, western India, and northeastern Afghanistan; extending from Pakistani Balochistan in the west to Uttar Pradesh in the east, northeastern Afghanistan in the north and Maharashtra in the south. Shortugai to the north is on the Oxus River, the Afghan border with Tajikistan, and in the west Sutkagan Dor is close to the Iranian border. The Kulli culture of Balochistan, of which more than 100 settlement sites are known, can be regarded as a local variant of the IVC, or a related culture.\n\nThe geography of the Indus Valley put the civilisations that arose there in a highly similar situation to those in Egypt and Peru, with rich agricultural lands being surrounded by highlands, desert, and ocean. Recently, Indus sites have been discovered in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as well. Other IVC colonies can be found in Afghanistan while smaller isolated colonies can be found as far away as Turkmenistan and in Maharashtra. The largest number of colonies are in the Punjab, Sindh, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Gujarat belt. Coastal settlements extended from Sutkagan Dor in Western Baluchistan to Lothal in Gujarat. An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortughai in northern Afghanistan, in the Gomal River valley in northwestern Pakistan, at Manda, Jammu on the Beas River near Jammu, India, and at Alamgirpur on the Hindon River, only 28 km from Delhi. The southern most site of the Indus valley civilisation is Daimabad in Maharashtra. Indus Valley sites have been found most often on rivers, but also on the ancient seacoast, for example, Balakot, and on islands, for example, Dholavira.\n\nIt flourished along the system of monsoon-fed perennial rivers in the basins of the Ghaggar-Hakra River in northwest India, and the Indus River flowing through the length of Pakistan. There is evidence of dry river beds overlapping with the Ghaggar River in India and Hakra channel in Pakistan.\n\n616 sites have been discovered along the dried up river beds of the Ghaggar-Hakra River and its tributaries, while 406 sites have been found along the Indus and its tributaries. According to Shereen Ratnagar the Ghaggar-Hakra desert area has more remaining sites than the alluvium of the Indus Valley, since the Ghaggar-Hakra desert area has been left untouched by settlements and agriculture since the end of the Indus Valley Civilisation.\n\nThe ruins of Harappa were described in 1842 by Charles Masson in his \"Narrative of Various Journeys in Balochistan, Afghanistan, and the Punjab\", where locals talked of an ancient city extending \"thirteen cosses\" (about 25 miles or 41 km).\nIn 1856, Alexander Cunningham, later director-general of the Archaeological Survey of Northern India, visited Harappa where the British engineers John and William Brunton were laying the East Indian Railway Company line connecting the cities of Karachi and Lahore. John wrote, \"I was much exercised in my mind how we were to get ballast for the line of the railway\". They were told of an ancient ruined city near the lines, called Harappa. Visiting the city, he found it full of hard well-burnt bricks, and, \"convinced that there was a grand quarry for the ballast I wanted\", the city of Harappa was reduced to ballast. A few months later, further north, John's brother William Brunton's \"section of the line ran near another ruined city, bricks from which had already been used by villagers in the nearby village of Harappa at the same site. These bricks now provided ballast along of the railroad track running from Karachi to Lahore\".\n\nIn 1872–75, Cunningham published the first Harappan seal (with an erroneous identification as Brahmi letters). More Harappan seals were discovered in 1912 by John Faithfull Fleet, prompting an archaeological campaign under Sir John Hubert Marshall. Marshall, Rai Bahadur Daya Ram Sahni and Madho Sarup Vats began excavating Harappa in 1921, finding buildings and artefacts indicative of an ancient civilisation. These were soon complemented by discoveries at Mohenjo-daro by Rakhal Das Banerjee, Ernest J. H. Mackay, and Marshall. By 1931, much of Mohenjo-daro had been excavated, but excavations continued, such as that led by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, director of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1944. Among other archaeologists who worked on IVC sites before the independence in 1947 were Ahmad Hasan Dani, Brij Basi Lal, Nani Gopal Majumdar, and Sir Marc Aurel Stein.\n\nFollowing independence, the bulk of the archaeological finds were inherited by Pakistan where most of the IVC was based; but due to more recent discoveries, India now has 50% more sites than Pakistan. Outposts of the Indus Valley civilisation were excavated as far west as Sutkagan Dor in Pakistani Balochistan, as far north as at Shortugai on the Amu Darya (the river's ancient name was Oxus) in current Afghanistan, as far east as at Alamgirpur, Uttar Pradesh, India and as far south as at Malwan, in modern-day Surat, Gujarat, India.\n\nIn 2010, heavy floods hit Haryana in India and damaged the archaeological site of Jognakhera, where ancient copper smelting furnaces were found dating back almost 5,000 years. The Indus Valley Civilisation site was hit by almost 10 feet of water as the Sutlej Yamuna link canal overflowed.\n\nThe cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation had \"social hierarchies, their writing system, their large planned cities and their long-distance trade [which] mark them to archaeologists as a full-fledged 'civilisation.'\" The mature phase of the Harappan civilisation lasted from c. 2600 to 1900 BCE. With the inclusion of the predecessor and successor cultures – Early Harappan and Late Harappan, respectively – the entire Indus Valley Civilisation may be taken to have lasted from the 33rd to the 14th centuries BCE. It is part of the Indus Valley Tradition, which also includes the pre-Harappan occupation of Mehrgarh, the earliest farming site of the Indus Valley.\n\nSeveral periodisations are employed for the periodisation of the IVC. The most commonly used classifies the Indus Valley Civilisation into Early, Mature and Late Harappan Phase. An alternative approach by Shaffer divides the broader Indus Valley Tradition into four eras, the pre-Harappan \"Early Food Producing Era,\" and the Regionalisation, Integration, and Localisation eras, which correspond roughly with the Early Harappan, Mature Harappan, and Late Harappan phases.\n\nAccording to Rao, Hakra Ware has been found at Bhirrana, and is \"pre-Harappan\", dating to the 8th–7th millennium BCE. Hakra Ware culture is a material culture which is contemporaneous with the early Harappan Ravi phase culture (3300–2800 BCE) of the Indus Valley. According to Dikshit and Rami, the estimation for the antiquity of Bhirrana as \"pre-Harappan\" is based on two calculations of charcoal samples, giving two dates of respectively 7570–7180 BCE, and 6689–6201 BCE.\n\nMehrgarh is a Neolithic (7000 BCE to c. 2500 BCE) site to the west of the Indus River valley, near the capital of the Kachi District in Pakistan, on the Kacchi Plain of Balochistan, near the Bolan Pass. According to Ahmad Hasan Dani, professor emeritus at Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad, the discovery of Mehrgarh \"changed the entire concept of the Indus civilisation […] There we have the whole sequence, right from the beginning of settled village life.\" Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia. According to Parpola, the culture migrated into the Indus Valley and became the Indus Valley Civilisation.\n\nMehrgarh was influenced by the Near Eastern Neolithic, with similarities between \"domesticated wheat varieties, early phases of farming, pottery, other archaeological artefacts, some domesticated plants and herd animals.\" Gallego Romero et al. (2011) notice that \"[t]he earliest evidence of cattle herding in south Asia comes from the Indus River Valley site of Mehrgarh and is dated to 7,000 YBP.\"\n\nLukacs and Hemphill suggest an initial local development of Mehrgarh, with a continuity in cultural development but a change in population. According to Lukacs and Hemphill, while there is a strong continuity between the neolithic and chalcolithic (Copper Age) cultures of Mehrgarh, dental evidence shows that the chalcolithic population did not descend from the neolithic population of Mehrgarh, which \"suggests moderate levels of gene flow.\" Mascarenhas et al. (2015) note that \"new, possibly West Asian, body types are reported from the graves of Mehrgarh beginning in the Togau phase (3800 BCE).\" According to Narasimhan et al. (2018), the IVC-population likely resulted from a mixture of Iranian agriculturalists and South Asian hunter-gatherers, and came into being between ca. 4700–3000 BCE.\n\nThe Early Harappan Ravi Phase, named after the nearby Ravi River, lasted from BCE until 2800 BCE. It is related to the Hakra Phase, identified in the Ghaggar-Hakra River Valley to the west, and predates the Kot Diji Phase (2800–2600 BCE, Harappan 2), named after a site in northern Sindh, Pakistan, near Mohenjo-daro. The earliest examples of the Indus script date to the 3rd millennium BCE.\n\nThe mature phase of earlier village cultures is represented by Rehman Dheri and Amri in Pakistan. Kot Diji represents the phase leading up to Mature Harappan, with the citadel representing centralised authority and an increasingly urban quality of life. Another town of this stage was found at Kalibangan in India on the Hakra River.\n\nTrade networks linked this culture with related regional cultures and distant sources of raw materials, including lapis lazuli and other materials for bead-making. By this time, villagers had domesticated numerous crops, including peas, sesame seeds, dates, and cotton, as well as animals, including the water buffalo. Early Harappan communities turned to large urban centres by 2600 BCE, from where the mature Harappan phase started. The latest research shows that Indus Valley people migrated from villages to cities.\n\nThe final stages of the Early Harappan period are characterised by the building of large walled settlements, the expansion of trade networks, and the increasing integration of regional communities into a \"relatively uniform\" material culture in terms of pottery styles, ornaments, and stamp seals with Indus script, leading into the transition to the Mature Harappan phase.\n\nAccording to Giosan et al. (2012), the slow southward migration of the monsoons across Asia initially allowed the Indus Valley villages to develop by taming the floods of the Indus and its tributaries. Flood-supported farming led to large agricultural surpluses, which in turn supported the development of cities. The IVC residents did not develop irrigation capabilities, relying mainly on the seasonal monsoons leading to summer floods. Brooke further notes that the development of advanced cities coincides with a reduction in rainfall, which may have triggered a reorganisation into larger urban centers.\n\nAccording to J. G. Shaffer and D. A. Lichtenstein, the Mature Harappan Civilisation was \"a fusion of the Bagor, Hakra, and Kot Diji traditions or 'ethnic groups' in the Ghaggar-Hakra valley on the borders of India and Pakistan\".\n\nBy 2600 BCE, the Early Harappan communities turned into large urban centres. Such urban centres include Harappa, Ganeriwala, Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan, and Dholavira, Kalibangan, Rakhigarhi, Rupar, and Lothal in modern-day India. In total, more than 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Indus Rivers and their tributaries.\n\nA sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture is evident in the Indus Valley Civilisation making them the first urban centre in the region. The quality of municipal town planning suggests the knowledge of urban planning and efficient municipal governments which placed a high priority on hygiene, or, alternatively, accessibility to the means of religious ritual.\n\nAs seen in Harappa, Mohenjo-daro and the recently partially excavated Rakhigarhi, this urban plan included the world's first known urban sanitation systems: see hydraulic engineering of the Indus Valley Civilisation. Within the city, individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from wells. From a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing, waste water was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets. Houses opened only to inner courtyards and smaller lanes. The house-building in some villages in the region still resembles in some respects the house-building of the Harappans.\n\nThe ancient Indus systems of sewerage and drainage that were developed and used in cities throughout the Indus region were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the Middle East and even more efficient than those in many areas of Pakistan and India today. The advanced architecture of the Harappans is shown by their impressive dockyards, granaries, warehouses, brick platforms, and protective walls. The massive walls of Indus cities most likely protected the Harappans from floods and may have dissuaded military conflicts.\nThe purpose of the citadel remains debated. In sharp contrast to this civilisation's contemporaries, Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, no large monumental structures were built. There is no conclusive evidence of palaces or temples – or of kings, armies, or priests. Some structures are thought to have been granaries. Found at one city is an enormous well-built bath (the \"Great Bath\"), which may have been a public bath. Although the citadels were walled, it is far from clear that these structures were defensive. They may have been built to divert flood waters.\n\nMost city dwellers appear to have been traders or artisans, who lived with others pursuing the same occupation in well-defined neighbourhoods. Materials from distant regions were used in the cities for constructing seals, beads and other objects. Among the artefacts discovered were beautiful glazed faïence beads. Steatite seals have images of animals, people (perhaps gods), and other types of inscriptions, including the yet un-deciphered writing system of the Indus Valley Civilisation. Some of the seals were used to stamp clay on trade goods and most probably had other uses as well.\n\nAlthough some houses were larger than others, Indus Civilisation cities were remarkable for their apparent, if relative, egalitarianism. All the houses had access to water and drainage facilities. This gives the impression of a society with relatively low wealth concentration, though clear social levelling is seen in personal adornments. \nToilets that used water were used in the Indus Valley Civilisation. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.\n\nArchaeological records provide no immediate answers for a centre of power or for depictions of people in power in Harappan society. But, there are indications of complex decisions being taken and implemented. For instance, the majority of the cities were constructed in a highly uniform and well-planned grid pattern, suggesting they were planned by a central authority; extraordinary uniformity of Harappan artefacts as evident in pottery, seals, weights and bricks; presence of public facilities and monumental architecture; heterogeneity in the mortuary symbolism and in grave goods (items included in burials).\n\nThese are the major theories:\n\nThe people of the Indus Civilisation achieved great accuracy in measuring length, mass, and time. They were among the first to develop a system of uniform weights and measures. A comparison of available objects indicates large scale variation across the Indus territories. Their smallest division, which is marked on an ivory scale found in Lothal in Gujarat, was approximately 1.704 mm, the smallest division ever recorded on a scale of the Bronze Age. Harappan engineers followed the decimal division of measurement for all practical purposes, including the measurement of mass as revealed by their hexahedron weights.\n\nThese chert weights were in a ratio of 5:2:1 with weights of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 units, with each unit weighing approximately 28 grams, similar to the English Imperial ounce or Greek uncia, and smaller objects were weighed in similar ratios with the units of 0.871. However, as in other cultures, actual weights were not uniform throughout the area. The weights and measures later used in Kautilya's \"Arthashastra\" (4th century BCE) are the same as those used in Lothal.\n\nHarappans evolved some new techniques in metallurgy and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin. The engineering skill of the Harappans was remarkable, especially in building docks.\n\nIn 2001, archaeologists studying the remains of two men from Mehrgarh, Pakistan, discovered that the people of the Indus Valley Civilisation, from the early Harappan periods, had knowledge of proto-dentistry. Later, in April 2006, it was announced in the scientific journal \"Nature\" that the oldest (and first early Neolithic) evidence for the drilling of human teeth \"in vivo\" (i.e., in a living person) was found in Mehrgarh. Eleven drilled molar crowns from nine adults were discovered in a Neolithic graveyard in Mehrgarh that dates from 7,500–9,000 years ago. According to the authors, their discoveries point to a tradition of proto-dentistry in the early farming cultures of that region.\n\nA touchstone bearing gold streaks was found in Banawali, which was probably used for testing the purity of gold (such a technique is still used in some parts of India).\n\nVarious sculptures, seals, bronze vessels pottery, gold jewellery, and anatomically detailed figurines in terracotta, bronze, and steatite have been found at excavation sites.\n\nA number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some dance form. These terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultic significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols.\n\nSir John Marshall reacted with surprise when he saw the famous Indus bronze statuette of a slender-limbed dancing girl in Mohenjo-daro:\n\nMany crafts including, \"shell working, ceramics, and agate and glazed steatite bead making\" were practised and the pieces were used in the making of necklaces, bangles, and other ornaments from all phases of Harappan culture. Some of these crafts are still practised in the subcontinent today. Some make-up and toiletry items (a special kind of combs (kakai), the use of collyrium and a special three-in-one toiletry gadget) that were found in Harappan contexts still have similar counterparts in modern India. Terracotta female figurines were found (ca. 2800–2600 BCE) which had red colour applied to the \"manga\" (line of partition of the hair).\n\nSeals have been found at Mohenjo-daro depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a yoga-like pose (see image, the so-called \"Pashupati\", below). This figure, sometimes known as a Pashupati, has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva. If this can be validated, it would be evidence that some aspects of Hinduism predate the earliest texts, the Veda.\n\nA harp-like instrument depicted on an Indus seal and two shell objects found at Lothal indicate the use of stringed musical instruments. The Harappans also made various toys and games, among them cubical dice (with one to six holes on the faces), which were found in sites like Mohenjo-Daro.\n\nThe Indus civilisation's economy appears to have depended significantly on trade, which was facilitated by major advances in transport technology. The IVC may have been the first civilisation to use wheeled transport. These advances may have included bullock carts that are identical to those seen throughout South Asia today, as well as boats. Most of these boats were probably small, flat-bottomed craft, perhaps driven by sail, similar to those one can see on the Indus River today; however, there is secondary evidence of sea-going craft. Archaeologists have discovered a massive, dredged canal and what they regard as a docking facility at the coastal city of Lothal in western India (Gujarat state). An extensive canal network, used for irrigation, has however also been discovered by H.-P. Francfort.\n\nDuring 4300–3200 BCE of the chalcolithic period (copper age), the Indus Valley Civilisation area shows ceramic similarities with southern Turkmenistan and northern Iran which suggest considerable mobility and trade. During the Early Harappan period (about 3200–2600 BCE), similarities in pottery, seals, figurines, ornaments, etc. document intensive caravan trade with Central Asia and the Iranian plateau.\n\nJudging from the dispersal of Indus civilisation artefacts, the trade networks, economically, integrated a huge area, including portions of Afghanistan, the coastal regions of Persia, northern and western India, and Mesopotamia. Studies of tooth enamel from individuals buried at Harappa suggest that some residents had migrated to the city from beyond the Indus Valley. There is some evidence that trade contacts extended to Crete and possibly to Egypt.\n\nThere was an extensive maritime trade network operating between the Harappan and Mesopotamian civilisations as early as the middle Harappan Phase, with much commerce being handled by \"middlemen merchants from Dilmun\" (modern Bahrain and Failaka located in the Persian Gulf). Such long-distance sea trade became feasible with the development of plank-built watercraft, equipped with a single central mast supporting a sail of woven rushes or cloth.\n\nSeveral coastal settlements like Sotkagen-dor (astride Dasht River, north of Jiwani), Sokhta Koh (astride Shadi River, north of Pasni), and Balakot (near Sonmiani) in Pakistan along with Lothal in western India, testify to their role as Harappan trading outposts. Shallow harbours located at the estuaries of rivers opening into the sea allowed brisk maritime trade with Mesopotamian cities.\n\nIt is generally assumed that most trade between the Indus Valley (ancient Meluhha?) and western neighbors proceeded up the Persian Gulf rather than overland. Although there is no incontrovertible proof that this was indeed the case, the distribution of Indus-type artifacts on the Oman peninsula, on Bahrain and in southern Mesopotamia makes it plausible that a series of maritime stages linked the Indus Valley and the Gulf region.\n\nIn the 1980s, important archaeological discoveries were made at Ras al-Jinz (Oman), demonstrating maritime Indus Valley connections with the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nAccording to Gangal et al. (2014), there is strong archeological and geographical evidence that neolithic farming spread from the Near East into north-west India, but there is also \"good evidence for the local domestication of barley and the zebu cattle at Mehrgarh.\"\n\nAccording to Jean-Francois Jarrige, farming had an independent origin at Mehrgarh, despite the similarities which he notes between Neolithic sites from eastern Mesopotamia and the western Indus valley, which are evidence of a \"cultural continuum\" between those sites. Nevertheless, Jarrige concludes that Mehrgarh has an earlier local background,\" and is not a \"'backwater' of the Neolithic culture of the Near East.\" Archaeologist Jim G. Shaffer writes that the Mehrgarh site \"demonstrates that food production was an indigenous South Asian phenomenon\" and that the data support interpretation of \"the prehistoric urbanisation and complex social organisation in South Asia as based on indigenous, but not isolated, cultural developments\".\n\nJarrige notes that the people of Mehrgarh used domesticated wheats and barley, while Shaffer and Liechtenstein note that the major cultivated cereal crop was naked six-row barley, a crop derived from two-row barley. Gangal agrees that \"Neolithic domesticated crops in Mehrgarh include more than 90% barley,\" noting that \"there is good evidence for the local domestication of barley.\" Yet, Gangal also notes that the crop also included \"a small amount of wheat,\" which \"are suggested to be of Near-Eastern origin, as the modern distribution of wild varieties of wheat is limited to Northern Levant and Southern Turkey.\"\n\nThe cattle that are often portrayed on Indus seals are humped Indian aurochs, which are similar to Zebu cattle. Zebu cattle is still common in India, and in Africa. It is different from the European cattle, and had been originally domesticated on the Indian subcontinent, probably in the Baluchistan region of Pakistan.\n\nResearch by J. Bates et al. (2016) confirms that Indus populations were the earliest people to use complex multi-cropping strategies across both seasons, growing foods during summer (rice, millets and beans) and winter (wheat, barley and pulses), which required different watering regimes. J. Bates et al. (2016) also found evidence for an entirely separate domestication process of rice in ancient South Asia, based around the wild species \"Oryza nivara\". This led to the local development of a mix of \"wetland\" and \"dryland\" agriculture of local \"Oryza sativa indica\" rice agriculture, before the truly \"wetland\" rice \"Oryza sativa japonica\" arrived around 2000 BCE.\n\nIt has often been suggested that the bearers of the IVC corresponded to proto-Dravidians linguistically, the break-up of proto-Dravidian corresponding to the break-up of the Late Harappan culture. Finnish Indologist Asko Parpola concludes that the uniformity of the Indus inscriptions precludes any possibility of widely different languages being used, and that an early form of Dravidian language must have been the language of the Indus people. Today, the Dravidian language family is concentrated mostly in southern India and northern and eastern Sri Lanka, but pockets of it still remain throughout the rest of India and Pakistan (the Brahui language), which lends credence to the theory.\n\nAccording to Heggarty and Renfrew, Dravidian languages may have spread into the Indian subcontinent with the spread of farming. According to David McAlpin, the Dravidian languages were brought to India by immigration into India from Elam. In earlier publications, Renfrew also stated that proto-Dravidian was brought to India by farmers from the Iranian part of the Fertile Crescent, but more recently Heggarty and Renfrew note that \"a great deal remains to be done in elucidating the prehistory of Dravidian.\" They also note that \"McAlpin's analysis of the language data, and thus his claims, remain far from orthodoxy.\" Heggarty and Renfrew conclude that several scenarios are compatible with the data, and that \"the linguistic jury is still very much out.\"\n\nBetween 400 and as many as 600 distinct Indus symbols have been found on seals, small tablets, ceramic pots and more than a dozen other materials, including a \"signboard\" that apparently once hung over the gate of the inner citadel of the Indus city of Dholavira. Typical Indus inscriptions are no more than four or five characters in length, most of which (aside from the Dholavira \"signboard\") are tiny; the longest on a single surface, which is less than 1 inch (2.54 cm) square, is 17 signs long; the longest on any object (found on three different faces of a mass-produced object) has a length of 26 symbols.\n\nWhile the Indus Valley Civilisation is generally characterised as a literate society on the evidence of these inscriptions, this description has been challenged by Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel (2004) who argue that the Indus system did not encode language, but was instead similar to a variety of non-linguistic sign systems used extensively in the Near East and other societies, to symbolise families, clans, gods, and religious concepts. Others have claimed on occasion that the symbols were exclusively used for economic transactions, but this claim leaves unexplained the appearance of Indus symbols on many ritual objects, many of which were mass-produced in moulds. No parallels to these mass-produced inscriptions are known in any other early ancient civilisations.\n\nIn a 2009 study by P. N. Rao et al. published in \"Science\", computer scientists, comparing the pattern of symbols to various linguistic scripts and non-linguistic systems, including DNA and a computer programming language, found that the Indus script's pattern is closer to that of spoken words, supporting the hypothesis that it codes for an as-yet-unknown language.\n\nFarmer, Sproat, and Witzel have disputed this finding, pointing out that Rao et al. did not actually compare the Indus signs with \"real-world non-linguistic systems\" but rather with \"two wholly artificial systems invented by the authors, one consisting of 200,000 randomly ordered signs and another of 200,000 fully ordered signs, that they spuriously claim represent the structures of all real-world non-linguistic sign systems\". Farmer et al. have also demonstrated that a comparison of a non-linguistic system like medieval heraldic signs with natural languages yields results similar to those that Rao et al. obtained with Indus signs. They conclude that the method used by Rao et al. cannot distinguish linguistic systems from non-linguistic ones.\n\nThe messages on the seals have proved to be too short to be decoded by a computer. Each seal has a distinctive combination of symbols and there are too few examples of each sequence to provide a sufficient context. The symbols that accompany the images vary from seal to seal, making it impossible to derive a meaning for the symbols from the images. There have, nonetheless, been a number of interpretations offered for the meaning of the seals. These interpretations have been marked by ambiguity and subjectivity.\n\nPhotos of many of the thousands of extant inscriptions are published in the \"Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions\" (1987, 1991, 2010), edited by Asko Parpola and his colleagues. The most recent volume republished photos taken in the 1920s and 1930s of hundreds of lost or stolen inscriptions, along with many discovered in the last few decades; formerly, researchers had to supplement the materials in the \"Corpus\" by study of the tiny photos in the excavation reports of Marshall (1931), MacKay (1938, 1943), Wheeler (1947), or reproductions in more recent scattered sources.\n\nEdakkal Caves in Wayanad district of Kerala contain drawings that range over periods from as early as 5000 BCE to 1000 BCE. The youngest group of paintings have been in the news for a possible connection to the Indus Valley Civilisation.\n\nThe religion and belief system of the Indus Valley people have received considerable attention, especially from the view of identifying precursors to deities and religious practices of Indian religions that later developed in the area. However, due to the sparsity of evidence, which is open to varying interpretations, and the fact that the Indus script remains undeciphered, the conclusions are partly speculative and largely based on a retrospective view from a much later Hindu perspective.\n\nAn early and influential work in the area that set the trend for Hindu interpretations of archaeological evidence from the Harappan sites was that of John Marshall, who in 1931 identified the following as prominent features of the Indus religion: a Great Male God and a Mother Goddess; deification or veneration of animals and plants; symbolic representation of the phallus (linga) and vulva (yoni); and, use of baths and water in religious practice. Marshall's interpretations have been much debated, and sometimes disputed over the following decades.\n\nOne Indus Valley seal shows a seated figure with a horned headdress, possibly tricephalic and possibly ithyphallic, surrounded by animals. Marshall identified the figure as an early form of the Hindu god Shiva (or Rudra), who is associated with asceticism, yoga, and linga; regarded as a lord of animals; and often depicted as having three eyes. The seal has hence come to be known as the Pashupati Seal, after \"Pashupati\" (lord of all animals), an epithet of Shiva. While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections. Doris Srinivasan has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in Vedic literature Rudra was not a protector of wild animals. Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with \"Mahisha\", the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with vahanas (vehicles) of deities for the four cardinal directions. Writing in 2002, Gregory L. Possehl concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognise the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would be going too far. Despite the criticisms of Marshall's association of the seal with a proto-Shiva icon, it has been interpreted as the Tirthankara Rishabhanatha by Jains and Vilas Sangave or an early Buddha by Buddhists. Historians such as Heinrich Zimmer and Thomas McEvilley believe that there is a connection between first Jain Tirthankara Rishabhanatha and the Indus Valley civilisation.\n\nMarshall hypothesised the existence of a cult of Mother Goddess worship based upon excavation of several female figurines, and thought that this was a precursor of the Hindu sect of Shaktism. However the function of the female figurines in the life of Indus Valley people remains unclear, and Possehl does not regard the evidence for Marshall's hypothesis to be \"terribly robust\". Some of the baetyls interpreted by Marshall to be sacred phallic representations are now thought to have been used as pestles or game counters instead, while the ring stones that were thought to symbolise \"yoni\" were determined to be architectural features used to stand pillars, although the possibility of their religious symbolism cannot be eliminated. Many Indus Valley seals show animals, with some depicting them being carried in processions, while others show chimeric creations. One seal from Mohenjo-daro shows a half-human, half-buffalo monster attacking a tiger, which may be a reference to the Sumerian myth of such a monster created by goddess Aruru to fight Gilgamesh.\n\nIn contrast to contemporary Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilisations, Indus Valley lacks any monumental palaces, even though excavated cities indicate that the society possessed the requisite engineering knowledge. This may suggest that religious ceremonies, if any, may have been largely confined to individual homes, small temples, or the open air. Several sites have been proposed by Marshall and later scholars as possibly devoted to religious purpose, but at present only the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro is widely thought to have been so used, as a place for ritual purification. The funerary practices of the Harappan civilisation are marked by their diversity, with evidence of supine burial, fractional burial (in which the body is reduced to skeletal remains by exposure to the elements before final interment), and even cremation.\n\nAround 1900 BCE signs of a gradual decline began to emerge, and by around 1700 BCE most of the cities had been abandoned. Recent examination of human skeletons from the site of Harappa has demonstrated that the end of the Indus civilisation saw an increase in inter-personal violence and in infectious diseases like leprosy and tuberculosis.\n\nAccording to historian Upinder Singh, \"the general picture presented by the late Harappan phase is one of a breakdown of urban networks and an expansion of rural ones.\"\n\nDuring the period of approximately 1900 to 1700 BCE, multiple regional cultures emerged within the area of the Indus civilisation. The Cemetery H culture was in Punjab, Haryana, and Western Uttar Pradesh, the Jhukar culture was in Sindh, and the Rangpur culture (characterised by Lustrous Red Ware pottery) was in Gujarat. Other sites associated with the Late phase of the Harappan culture are Pirak in Balochistan, Pakistan, and Daimabad in Maharashtra, India.\n\nThe largest Late Harappan sites are Kudwala in Cholistan, Bet Dwarka in Gujarat, and Daimabad in Maharashtra, which can be considered as urban, but they are smaller and few in number compared with the Mature Harappan cities. Bet Dwarka was fortified and continued to have contacts with the Persian Gulf region, but there was a general decrease of long-distance trade. On the other hand, the period also saw a diversification of the agricultural base, with a diversity of crops and the advent of double-cropping, as well as a shift of rural settlement towards the east and the south.\n\nThe pottery of the Late Harappan period is described as \"showing some continuity with mature Harappan pottery traditions,\" but also distinctive differences. Many sites continued to be occupied for some centuries, although their urban features declined and disappeared. Formerly typical artifacts such as stone weights and female figurines became rare. There are some circular stamp seals with geometric designs, but lacking the Indus script which characterised the mature phase of the civilisation. Script is rare and confined to potsherd inscriptions. There was also a decline in long-distance trade, although the local cultures show new innovations in faience and glass making, and carving of stone beads. Urban amenities such as drains and the public bath were no longer maintained, and newer buildings were \"poorly constructed\". Stone sculptures were deliberately vandalised, valuables were sometimes concealed in hoards, suggesting unrest, and the corpses of animals and even humans were left unburied in the streets and in abandoned buildings.\n\nDuring the later half of the 2nd millennium BCE, most of the post-urban Late Harappan settlements were abandoned altogether. Subsequent material culture was typically characterised by temporary occupation, \"the campsites of a population which was nomadic and mainly pastoralist\" and which used \"crude handmade pottery.\" However, there is greater continuity and overlap between Late Harappan and subsequent cultural phases at sites in Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh, primarily small rural settlements.\n\nIn 1953 Sir Mortimer Wheeler proposed that the invasion of an Indo-European tribe from Central Asia, the \"Aryans\", caused the decline of the Indus Civilisation. As evidence, he cited a group of 37 skeletons found in various parts of Mohenjo-daro, and passages in the Vedas referring to battles and forts. However, scholars soon started to reject Wheeler's theory, since the skeletons belonged to a period after the city's abandonment and none were found near the citadel. Subsequent examinations of the skeletons by Kenneth Kennedy in 1994 showed that the marks on the skulls were caused by erosion, and not by violence.\nIn the Cemetery H culture (the late Harappan phase in the Punjab region), some of the designs painted on the funerary urns have been interpreted through the lens of Vedic literature: for instance, peacocks with hollow bodies and a small human form inside, which has been interpreted as the souls of the dead, and a hound that can be seen as the hound of Yama, the god of death. This may indicate the introduction of new religious beliefs during this period, but the archaeological evidence does not support the hypothesis that the Cemetery H people were the destroyers of the Harappan cities.\n\nSuggested contributory causes for the localisation of the IVC include changes in the course of the river, and climate change that is also signalled for the neighbouring areas of the Middle East. many scholars believe that drought, and a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia, caused the collapse of the Indus Civilisation. The climate change which caused the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation was possibly due to \"an abrupt and critical mega-drought and cooling 4,200 years ago,\" which marks the onset of the Meghalayan Age, the present stage of the Holocene.\n\nThe Ghaggar-Hakra system was rain-fed, and water-supply depended on the monsoons. The Indus Valley climate grew significantly cooler and drier from about 1800 BCE, linked to a general weakening of the monsoon at that time. The Indian monsoon declined and aridity increased, with the Ghaggar-Hakra retracting its reach towards the foothills of the Himalaya, leading to erratic and less extensive floods that made inundation agriculture less sustainable.\n\nAridification reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation's demise, and to scatter its population eastward. According to Giosan et al. (2012), the IVC residents did not develop irrigation capabilities, relying mainly on the seasonal monsoons leading to summer floods. As the monsoons kept shifting south, the floods grew too erratic for sustainable agricultural activities. The residents then migrated towards the Ganges basin in the east, where they established smaller villages and isolated farms. The small surplus produced in these small communities did not allow development of trade, and the cities died out.\n\nThere are archaeological evidences of major earthquakes at Dholavira in 2200 BCE as well as at Kalibangan in 2700 and 2900 BCE. Such succession of earthquakes, along with drought, may have contributed to decline of Ghaggar-Harka system. Sea level changes are also found at two possible seaport sites along the Makran coast which are now inland. Earthquakes may have contributed to decline of several sites by direct shaking damage, by sea level change or by change in water supply.\n\nArchaeological excavations indicate that the decline of Harappa drove people eastward. According to Possehl, after 1900 BCE the number of sites in today's India increased from 218 to 853. According to Andrew Lawler, \"excavations along the Gangetic plain show that cities began to arise there starting about 1200 BCE, just a few centuries after Harappa was deserted and much earlier than once suspected.\" According to Jim Shaffer there was a continuous series of cultural developments, just as in most areas of the world. These link \"the so-called two major phases of urbanisation in South Asia\".\n\nAt sites such as Bhagwanpura (in Haryana), archaeological excavations have discovered an overlap between the final phase of Late Harappan pottery and the earliest phase of Painted Grey Ware pottery, the latter being associated with the Vedic Culture and dating from around 1200 BCE. This site provides evidence of multiple social groups occupying the same village but using different pottery and living in different types of houses: \"over time the Late Harappan pottery was gradually replaced by Painted Grey ware pottery,\" and other cultural changes indicated by archaeology include the introduction of the horse, iron tools, and new religious practices.\n\nThere is also a Harappan site called Rojdi in Rajkot district of Saurashtra. Its excavation started under an archaeological team from Gujarat State Department of Archaeology and the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania in 1982–83. In their report on archaeological excavations at Rojdi, Gregory Possehl and M.H. Raval write that although there are \"obvious signs of cultural continuity\" between the Harappan Civilisation and later South Asian cultures, many aspects of the Harappan \"sociocultural system\" and \"integrated civilization\" were \"lost forever,\" while the Second Urbanisation of India (beginning with the Northern Black Polished Ware culture, c. 600 BCE) \"lies well outside this sociocultural environment\".\n\nPreviously, scholars believed that the decline of the Harappan civilisation led to an interruption of urban life in the Indian subcontinent. However, the Indus Valley Civilisation did not disappear suddenly, and many elements of the Indus Civilisation appear in later cultures. The Cemetery H culture may be the manifestation of the Late Harappan over a large area in the region of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, and the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture its successor. David Gordon White cites three other mainstream scholars who \"have emphatically demonstrated\" that Vedic religion derives partially from the Indus Valley Civilisations.\n\n, archaeological data suggests that the material culture classified as Late Harappan may have persisted until at least c. 1000–900 BCE and was partially contemporaneous with the Painted Grey Ware culture. Harvard archaeologist Richard Meadow points to the late Harappan settlement of Pirak, which thrived continuously from 1800 BCE to the time of the invasion of Alexander the Great in 325 BCE.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Indus Civilisation's localisation, regional cultures emerged, to varying degrees showing the influence of the Indus Civilisation. In the formerly great city of Harappa, burials have been found that correspond to a regional culture called the Cemetery H culture. At the same time, the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture expanded from Rajasthan into the Gangetic Plain. The Cemetery H culture has the earliest evidence for cremation; a practice dominant in Hinduism today.\n\nThe mature (Harappan) phase of the IVC is contemporary to the Early and Middle Bronze Age in the Ancient Near East, in particular the Old Elamite period, Early Dynastic to Ur III Mesopotamia, Prepalatial Minoan Crete and Old Kingdom to First Intermediate Period Egypt.\n\nThe IVC has been compared in particular with the civilisations of Elam (also in the context of the Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis) and with Minoan Crete (because of isolated cultural parallels such as the ubiquitous goddess worship and depictions of bull-leaping). The IVC has been tentatively identified with the toponym Meluhha known from Sumerian records; the Sumerians called them Meluhhaites.\n\nShahr-i-Sokhta, located in southeastern Iran shows trade route with Mesopotamia. A number of seals with Indus script have been also found in Mesopotamian sites.\n\nAfter the discovery of the IVC in the 1920s, it was immediately associated with the indigenous Dasyu inimical to the Rigvedic tribes in numerous hymns of the Rigveda. Mortimer Wheeler interpreted the presence of many unburied corpses found in the top levels of Mohenjo-daro as the victims of a warlike conquest, and famously stated that \"Indra stands accused\" of the destruction of the IVC. The association of the IVC with the city-dwelling Dasyus remains alluring because the assumed timeframe of the first Indo-Aryan migration into India corresponds neatly with the period of decline of the IVC seen in the archaeological record. The discovery of the advanced, urban IVC however changed the 19th-century view of early Indo-Aryan migration as an \"invasion\" of an advanced culture at the expense of a \"primitive\" aboriginal population to a gradual acculturation of nomadic \"barbarians\" on an advanced urban civilisation, comparable to the Germanic migrations after the Fall of Rome, or the Kassite invasion of Babylonia. This move away from simplistic \"invasionist\" scenarios parallels similar developments in thinking about language transfer and population movement in general, such as in the case of the migration of the proto-Greek speakers into Greece, or the Indo-Europeanisation of Western Europe.\n\nProto-Munda (or Para-Munda) and a \"lost phylum\" (perhaps related or ancestral to the Nihali language) have been proposed as other candidates for the language of the IVC. Michael Witzel suggests an underlying, prefixing language that is similar to Austroasiatic, notably Khasi; he argues that the Rigveda shows signs of this hypothetical Harappan influence in the earliest historic level, and Dravidian only in later levels, suggesting that speakers of Austroasiatic were the original inhabitants of Punjab and that the Indo-Aryans encountered speakers of Dravidian only in later times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50822121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50822121", "title": "Ioan Bianu", "text": "Ioan Bianu\n\nIoan Bianu (1856 or 1857 – February 13, 1935) was an Imperial Austrian-born Romanian philologist and bibliographer. The son of a peasant family from Transylvania, he completed high school in Blaj, where he became a disciple of Timotei Cipariu and Ioan Micu Moldovan. As a youth, he espoused Romanian nationalism, and came into conflict with the Austro-Hungarian authorities, before finally emigrating to the Romanian Old Kingdom in 1876. There, he attended the University of Bucharest, later joining the faculty, where he taught Romanian literary history. He was affiliated with the Romanian Academy Library for over half a century, transforming the institution from the meager state in which he found it, and overseeing a five-fold increase of its collection. He helped author two important multi-volume works detailing early books and manuscripts from his country, and was a founder of library and information science in his adoptive country. Near the end of his life, struggling with deafness, Bianu withdrew from the Library in favor of his friend Radu R. Rosetti, but went on to serve as president of the Romanian Academy.\n\nBianu's scholarship was doubled by his work as an organizer in the field, and, especially after 1880, by a participation in political intrigues. He was a disciple of Dimitrie Sturdza, joining the latter's National Liberal Party and canvassing support in academia. Bianu continued to agitate among the Transylvanian Romanians, but, by 1896, both he and Sturdza had turned moderate on the national issue, and favored a rapprochement with Austria-Hungary. As such, Bianu was a \"Germanophile\" during World War I, meaning that he criticized Romania's alliance with the Entente Powers. He remained in German-occupied territory following the fall of Bucharest, but was spared persecution upon the end of war.\n\nHe was born in Făget (Oláhbükkös), a village east of the Transylvanian town of Blaj (on the southern border of Kis-Küküllő County from 1876, and nowadays in Alba County). His parents, Grigore and Anica (\"née\" Popa), married in 1855; it was Grigore's second marriage. The couple had two sons and three daughters, all of whom survived into adulthood. The Bianu family was an old peasant one of some means, the village a small Romanian one on a hillside. Living in proximity to the spiritual center of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church in what was then the Austrian Empire, they belonged to that faith. Bianu attended primary school in his native village. His father understood the importance of schooling, even if this implied material sacrifices, and the boy studied for nearly a decade at the gymnasium and the Romanian high school in Blaj. When he arrived in 1868, the local atmosphere was uncertain and marked by the faculty's activism against the recent Austro-Hungarian Compromise, which consecrated Transylvania part of the Hungarian Crown, against Romanian demands.\n\nWhile Bianu was there, Timotei Cipariu was at the height of his career. He lived with one of his teachers, Ioan Micu Moldovan, who helped provide for his daily needs and with whom the former pupil kept touch until the teacher's death in 1915. It was in Moldovan's home that Bianu's interest in old Romanian books was first awakened, and he recalled in later years how he was treated there like a son. One of his final acts at the school was to participate in an annual demonstration of the May 1848 assembly on \"Câmpia Libertății\". This was the last such gathering, as the Hungarian authorities banned them henceforth.\n\nBianu graduated in 1876, in the same class as his cousin Vasile Bianu, the future physician and political figure. Bearing a recommendation from Moldovan for August Treboniu Laurian, Ioan left for Bucharest, capital of the Romanian Old Kingdom; four classmates joined him in emigrating. Laurian, supported by the poet Gheorghe Sion, obtained him a post as assistant at the Central State Library. He was thus able to support himself until 1880 while attending the literature and philosophy faculty of Bucharest University. In early 1879, he was named archivist and librarian of the Romanian Academy. Notoriously thrifty, he lived on the Romanian Academy Library grounds, downtown Bucharest, where he also raised cows.\n\nIn 1881, he won a competition to become professor of Romanian language and literature at Saint Sava National College. Later that year, with the help of his former professor Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, he received a scholarship to study Romance philology in Milan and Paris. He met the Romanist Émile Picot, took courses with Graziadio Isaia Ascoli and Gaston Paris, but the lasting impact of his sojourn lay in the eye-opening visits to libraries. Impressed by the Palazzo Brera, the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, libraries across Italy, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the British Museum and the Bodleian Library, he at the same time became keenly aware of the poor state of Romania's libraries and gathered ideas for their improvement.\nAfter returning home in 1883, he became assistant professor at Bucharest University's department of Romanian literature. He still made visits abroad: in 1885, he spent time in Galicia-Lodomeria, researching the Jagiellonian Library for Romanian-related subjects, the Ossoliński archive at Lemberg, and the Dosoftei fund at Schowkwa. Upon his own request, he was also sent to Russian Poland, where he researched the Radziwiłł collection at Nesvizh Castle. He was hosted there by Antoni Radziwiłł, who allowed him to copy some 300 documents, and befriended his young daughter, later the Countess Potocki.\n\nUpon his return to Bucharest in June 1886, Bianu married Alexandrina Băicoianu, described by his friend Sextil Pușcariu as a \"brilliantly spiritual\" woman, and was thus received into the Bucharest upper-class. As noted by social historian Lucian Nastasă, this move also ensured Bianu more recognition as a scholar, as well as access to politics—through Băicoianu, he was now related to historian Alexandru D. Xenopol and politician Nicolae Xenopol. The couple were Pușcariu's godparents upon the latter's own wedding, in September 1905.\n\nIn 1888, Bianu began his collaboration with Hasdeu's neoromantic literary review, \"Revista Nouă\". He contributed the book review column, as well as a biography of the writer Gheorghe Asachi. Elected a corresponding member of the Academy in 1887, he was elevated to titular status in 1902. After losing the Romanian literature chair to Ovid Densusianu in 1901, in 1902 Bianu became the titled holder of the Romanian literature history professorate at the University. He was later also elected dean of the literature faculty. In addition to such work, in 1904 he served on a panel of inquiry created by the Ministry of Education, closing down the Notre-Dame de Sion schools, accused of forcefully converting Orthodox students to Catholicism.\n\nMeanwhile, a member of the National Liberal Party (PNL) and auditor of its Bucharest club, Bianu was an ally of Dimitrie Sturdza and reached the Assembly of Deputies. Without serious ambitions in this realm, he preferred to be a sort of \"éminence grise\" to the party leader. From as early as 1887, he interceded between Sturdza and PNL-friendly academics, including the Slavist Ioan Bogdan, obtaining their support against rival Conservatives, and helping them travel for specialization abroad. However, Bianu maintained links with the Conservatives' literary club, \"Junimea\", which he frequented as an outside guest in the 1880s. He also maintained links with the Conservative clubs of Western Moldavia, befriending the moderate Conservative Radu Rosetti—and then his young son, Radu R. Rosetti. The two politicians discussed issues on bipartisan policies, and even conspired to remove incompetent administrators of either hue from their offices. He and Hasdeu also persuaded Radu Sr to start his work as a social historian and theorist, and afterward helped him to find employment as an archivist. According to Nastasă, Bianu, allegedly the lover of Sturdza's wife Zoe, was an expert at maneuvering the \"levers of power\", and presided upon his own \"clique\".\n\nBianu was initially an orthodox Romanian nationalist, campaigning for unity between Romania and his native Transylvania. During the early 1880s, when Sturdza served as Academy president, Bianu returned to Blaj, hoping to persuade Cipariu to resume his contacts with the Academy. Cipariu objected, mainly because of his dislike for Hasdeu and his conflict with Laurian. In 1892, Bianu joined the executive committee of the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians and began sending out sponsorship to the leaders of the \"Transylvanian Memorandum\" protest movement. During the backlash, Bianu was sent by Sturdza to assist Eugen Brote and other exiled \"Memorandists\" at Milan. His plan to resettle the participants in various European countries was nevertheless seen as \"downright absurd\" by its intended beneficiaries, who preferred to stand trial.\n\nBianu's own stance on Transylvania changed over several years. In 1896, with Sturdza as Prime Minister, Bianu participated in the rapprochement with Austria-Hungary. During the state visit to Romania of Emperor Franz Joseph, Sturdza sent Bianu, Grigore Antipa, Ștefan Sihleanu and Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea to Vârciorova, where they were to meet Austrian delegates ahead of the Cultural League, which sent protesters. The two Romanian delegations clashed which each other, an incident which was reported with amusement in the Bucharest press. Bianu also continued to work for the Bucharest National Liberal club during the next decade, helping Sturdza win over \"Junimea\" from the Conservatives. During the elections of 1905, he backed the \"Junimist\" candidate Titu Maiorescu and, in return, obtained \"Junimea\"s support for the National Liberal Petru Poni. Bianu and Poni remained close friends for the rest of their lives. Bianu also used his influence for advancing many other scholarly goals, such as when, in 1909, he brought to Romania Ramiro Ortiz, who founded the Bucharest school of Italian studies.\n\nDuring the earliest stages of World War I, with Romania still cautiously neutral, Bianu also took a neutralist attitude. Historian Nicolae Iorga, who was president of the Cultural League, noted that Bianu, unlike Sturdza, did not wish to see Romania committed to the Central Powers. This was because \"he resented us fighting alongside the Hungarians, who never ever had any other objective but to crush us.\" However, Bianu was also one of the Transylvanians and minority-PNL members who also rejected proposals to join the Entente Powers. Among these \"Germanophiles\", Bianu stood out for speaking out against the project to occupy Transylvania from Austria-Hungary with Entente support. In August 1914, using the pen name Ion Frunză, he published the essay \"Pentru lămurirea situației. Cuvinte către români\" (\"Making Things Clear. An Address to the Romanians\"). This work, soon after translated into German, argued that the Entente was a cover for the Russian Empire, Pan-Slavism, and the \"Turanic hordes\"; he decried the persecution of Romanians in Austria-Hungary, but noted that they all fared much better than the Romanians living in Russia's Bessarabia Governorate. This view was instantly supported by the sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, who suggested that \"Frunză's admirable work\" should be published \"in millions of copies, so that every Romanian will read it\".\n\nEventually, in autumn 1916, a PNL cabinet and King Ferdinand I announced Romania's support for the Entente; Romanian troops briefly entered Transylvania, but Romania was in turn invaded by the Central Powers. Bianu stifled his opposition, but did not openly criticize all the Central Powers. In September, shortly after the Battle of Turtucaia, he penned in \"Viitorul\" an article specifically targeting the Kingdom of Bulgaria and the Bulgarians in Romania, whom he called \"venomous snakes\". According to historian Lucian Boia, this is \"possibly the most anti-Bulgarian writing ever published in Romanian\"; \"Bianu says nothing about the Austro-Hungarians or Germans, as if Romanians had only been at war with the Bulgarians in 1916!\"\n\nThe Romanian army and administration headed for Western Moldavia: Bianu's son Alexandru was drafted, but, according to his adversaries, spent the war in relative safety at Bârlad, shying away from active duty. Also controversially, Bianu Sr chose not to join the exodus, and remained with the Germanophiles and neutralists in occupied Bucharest, to 1918. He noted that he watched on, \"eyes flooded in tears\", as the German Army marched through the streets. One of ten academicians to remain behind, he ensured that the Academy Library continued to function in relatively normal terms, refusing to publish under the occupation regime, but also collaborating with the occupier to at least some degree. \n\nBianu's letters of the occupation are a primary source for the activities of Germanophiles such as Antipa, Petre P. Carp, Alexandru Al. Beldiman, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, and Iacob Negruzzi. Bianu sided with Carp in his critique of PNL politics, but, unlike him and Beldiman, did not call for the dethronement of King Ferdinand. He also refrained from signing up to Carp's openly pro-German platform. Nevertheless, he was remembered by the anti-Germanophiles for participating at banquets hosted by the puppet governor, Lupu Kostaki. The Austro-Hungarian Army also asked Bianu to vouch for officer Alexandru Leca Morariu, who was accused of being secretly a Romanian nationalist agitator.\n\nRomanian conceded defeat in May 1918, and the Academy could resume work in Bucharest under a German-friendly Conservative regime, with Alexandru Marghiloman as Prime Minister. In October, Bianu joined his returning peers and reported on the damages incurred during the previous years. He scandalized public opinion further after ordering public mourning at the Academy after the death of a pro-Austrian cleric, Vasile Mangra. The loyalist government was fully restored in Bucharest within a month, following the unexpected defeat of Germany, which led to the establishment of Greater Romania (which included united Transylvania). In December, Prime Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu was welcomed by the Academy. According to the now-disgraced Marghiloman, his supporters were either barred from attending or, in Bianu's case, silenced. In this new climate, Bianu was investigated by an Academy commission as a wartime collaborator in March 1919, but refused to present himself for questioning. As he put it, the group investigating him only relied on cut-outs from the anti-Germanophile press.\n\nIn May 1919, Bianu joined efforts with Iorga and other pro-Entente academicians in order to obtain the international recognition of Romania's new borders. However, they failed to convince Foreign Affairs to sponsor their diplomatic correspondence with Western European academies. Although he was mentioned by name and castigated in the Academy commission report of July 1919, Bianu suffered no further consequences. Three years later, a conflict erupted between King Ferdinand and the PNL, on one side, and the Transylvanian-based Romanian National Party (PNR), on the other. At core was the issue of Transylvanian autonomy. Bianu used his intermediary position to negotiate a PNR presence at Alba Iulia, where Ferdinand crowned himself King of Greater Romania, but was unable to convince Alexandru Vaida-Voevod.\n\nBianu's time was divided between Bucharest and Predeal, where, in 1912, he had built himself a villa. From ca. 1909, his wife had fallen ill and was hardly ever seen in public. Their son Alexandru studied law in Paris and returned to Romania in 1923 to work as a bank clerk, before finally joining the diplomatic corps and serving as commercial attaché in London. In 1924, Bianu helped organize Romania's first national congress of librarians, and later that year founded the country's first librarians' association, alongside a Romanian Practical School of Archival Science, modeled on the École Nationale des Chartes.\n\nDuring his final years, he declared his dissatisfaction with the \"exclusivist-repulsive individualism\" in Romanian academic life, describing it as an \"evil\" influence. In June 1925, he was forced to announce that the Academy had a 90% deficit and was cutting back on expenses. He continued to intervene politically for his various protegés, including the literary critic Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică and the linguist Theodor Capidan, and steered the career of philologist Alexandru Rosetti. In June 1926, Bianu and his cousin Vasile returned to Blaj for the Cultural League Congress, presided upon by Iorga. He also reluctantly presented himself as a candidate for the post of Academy president, but lost by a large margin to Emil Racoviță.\n\nBy then, Bianu had expressed his dislike of Italian fascism, and, as a consequence, the Italian authorities passed him over for awards and distinctions. In April 1928, during his last months at University, he seconded Rector Ermil Pangrati in urging government to dissolve the antisemitic Union of Christian Students, which was causing disturbances and riots; this stance was contrasted by Vasile, who, as a member of the Senate, argued that Romanian Jews sympathized with Hungarian irredentism. His teaching hampered by a progressive deafness, which had begun much earlier in life, Bianu withdrew from the University in mid 1928, resigning his seat to his disciple, folklorist Dumitru Caracostea. The previous year, Caracostea had contributed to a Bianu \"Festschrift\", alongside Iorga, Pușcariu, Alexandru Rosetti, Vasile Bogrea, Nicolae Cartojan, Charles Drouhet, and Petre P. Panaitescu. Although he had inaugurated a project to design a new Library building, Bianu ultimately resigned his position there in early 1931, assigning his seat to Radu R. Rosetti. At the time, he announced that he was also suffering from kidney disease and rheumatism.\n\nMade secretary general of the Academy in 1927, Bianu was elected as its president on June 1, 1929. An early admirer and political ally, the geologist Ludovic Mrazek, referred to Bianu as a force of professional conservatism, one of several \"decent men and sincere patriots\" who stood up to intellectual fads. In January 1932, the new king Carol II made Bianu a Knight of the Order of the Crown. The following month, on behalf of the Romanian Academy, Bianu and Gheorghe Țițeica began corresponding with the Soviet Academy of Sciences—part of a larger effort to bring about a détente in Romanian–Soviet relations. He resigned later that year, but continued to serve as vice president to his death.\n\nA widower since December 1929, Bianu died in his Bucharest home on February 13, 1935, after an episode of uremia. His body was laid in state at the Academy, and the Faculty of Letters marked the occasion by suspending courses for the day. He was buried alongside Alexandrina Bianu in Plot 54 of Bellu cemetery. In his obituary piece, the Cultural League's Iorga referred to Bianu as \"the Academy's titular god\". Bianu's personal book collections, comprising some 1,400 volumes, was bequeathed to the Academy Library.\n\nEncouraged by Alexandru Odobescu, Ion Ghica and Sturdza, who inspired in him an appreciation for books and libraries, Bianu renounced the idea of a scientific career in favor of working as a librarian. His first publication, in 1876, was a monograph on Samuil Micu-Klein. When he entered the Academy Library in 1879, the beginning of a 56-year affiliation that would end with his death, the institution had 6,000 donated volumes; by 1885, there were 30,000 and its formative phase was complete. In 1895, he started a bibliographic office at the library that through 1925 would attract the efforts of the country's scholars interested in creating a general bibliography of Romanian culture.\n\nUnder his leadership, the need for additional research tools became apparent. He helped counter the lack of manuscripts, old books and documents on the language and national history by initiating an ample campaign for identifying and donating such materials. He ensured that the Academy Library became the National Library and helped merge the Central State Library into this institution in 1901, later folding in a number of private libraries. He pushed for an 1884 law mandating printing presses to send two copies of everything they printed to the Academy Library, and was behind improvements to the law in 1904. Also that year, he became one of the main proponents of reforming the Romanian alphabet, but later declared himself against \"excessive phoneticism\", standing up to reformists such as Simion Mehedinți. During the war, he and Ioan Bogdan reported trying to rescue the Library's Church Slavonic corpus from confiscation by the Bulgarian Armed Forces.\n\nBianu authored a number of works on philology as well as history, particularly cultural history. Thoroughly familiar with old Romanian literature, he authored two books that remain valuable reference works. The first was the monumental \"Bibliografia Românească veche (1508–1830)\". Covering four volumes (1508–1716, 1716–1807, 1808–1817 and 1817–1830), it was written in collaboration with Nerva Hodoș and later Dan Simonescu. First suggested to Bianu by Émile Picot, it was conceived as a coherent and pan-Romanian project, supplanting earlier catalogues by Vasile Popp and Cipariu. As an analytical work, it was also based on Émile Legrand's \"Bibliographie hellénique ou description raisonnée des ouvrages publiés par des Grecs au XVIIIe siècle\".\n\nThe books it encompassed were published in the Romanian lands during this period in Romanian, Slavonic, Greek and even Georgian, by both Romanians and foreigners; it also included books published abroad by Romanians. Publication began in 1903 (preceded by early drafts from 1898), took a nearly two-decade hiatus after Hodoș' death in 1913, and resumed once Simonescu joined the project in 1931. It was completed after Bianu's death, in 1944. Likened to George Călinescu's history of Romanian literature, although more historic in aspect, it was the country's most ample bibliography at the time, praised by Iorga for its completeness. It was however criticized by later bibliographers, and by Bianu himself, for being inconsistent and incomplete in its selection or presentation of titles. The work covers 1,526 known books and 300 unknown works, going up to 2,024 with addenda and errata.\n\nPart of the preparation involved the 1898 press publication of an appeal for old books, in which priests, teachers, professors and others who owned or knew of books printed between 1508 and 1830 were asked to inform the library of their existence and if possible loan them. The appeal was accompanied by a list of 621 titles of known books in this category; its author was particularly interested in books not on the list. Bianu's call was received with particular enthusiasm in Transylvania. His former teacher Moldovan emerged as a steady collaborator, not only facilitating access to his library and Cipariu's diocesan collection, but also providing valuable advice over the years. In his turn, Moldovan sent a letter to the province's Greek-Catholic clergy, asking them to supply information about the rare books in their parishes, and Bianu soon received 140 responses regarding books that were not on his initial list.\n\nBianu's other key work was the three-volume \"Catalogul manuscriselor românești din Biblioteca Academiei\", written with two other authors and published between 1907 and 1931. Bianu published a number of other books on early Romanian literature as well as textual editions, including \"Psaltirea Scheiană\" and, in 1924, the newly discovered \"Codicele de la Ieud\". His close analysis of manuscripts and contributions to paleography through his study of the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet identify him as a historian; he also involved himself in disputes with Slavists over the publishing of historical sources—whether they should follow the interests of linguists or cater to historians. From 1926, he organized bibliophile exhibits at the Bellu House, on Academy grounds. Additionally, Bianu was responsible for \"Creșterea Colecțiunilor\", the Academy's bibliographic periodical, which between 1906 and 1929 chronicled the publications received by the library. His colleagues there included Ilarie Chendi, Septimiu Albini, Alexandru Sadi-Ionescu, Vasile Pârvan, Alexandru Lapedatu, George Giuglea, George Murnu, Nicolae Cartojan, Alexandru Obedenaru, Constantin Moisil and Ioachim Crăciun.\n\n His date of birth is usually given as September 8 or October 1, 1856, although it is possible he was born in 1857; a date of February 20 has been proposed. Bianu himself stated he was born in 1856.\n\n"}

He was a specialist on Ukrainian history of the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries, writing extensively on the social history of western Ukraine and the political history of the Ukrainian Cossacks, especially during the time of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky. He also wrote many textbooks for school use, popularizations, and some historical fiction for children.\n\nKrypiakevych was born and raised in Lemberg (Lviv) in Austrian Galicia in a family of the Greek Catholic priest and emigrant from the Chełm Land. During his school years Krypiakevych talked exclusively in Polish language. Later he studied history under Mykhailo Hrushevsky at Lviv University. He wrote his 1911 doctorate on \"The Cossacks and Bathory's Privileges,\" a study of the origins of the Ukrainian Cossacks legally registered with the Polish government. From 1908 to 1914, he published extensively in Galician Ukrainian journals and magazines and took part in the \"Prosvita\", or \"Enlightenment\" movement geared to raise the educational level of the Galician Ukrainian peasantry. From 1905, he began publishing in the scholarly journal of the Shevchenko Scientific Society, which under the leadership of Hrushevsky became a kind of unofficial Ukrainian Academy of Sciences serving the Ukrainian people on both sides of the Austrian-Russian border. In 1907 Krypiakevych on the notice of Andrzej Kazimierz Potocki, a Governor of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, was imprisoned for student protests that took place near the Lviv University. He initially was detained as a terrorist, but later it was degraded as disturbing a public peace.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1939, he taught at the Polish gymnasia (High Schools) at Zhovkva and Rohatyn and at the Academic Gymnasium in Lviv. From 1918 to 1919, he taught at the newly established Ukrainian University at Kamianets-Podilskyi but returned to Galicia (now absorbed into Poland) at the fall of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the Soviets. In 1921-25 Krypiakevych was a professor of the clandestine Lviv Ukrainian University.\n\nDuring the interwar period, Krypiakevych, being excluded from a university position by the Polish regime, continued to teach at various gymnasia and to actively support the Shevchenko Scientific Society. From 1921 to 1924, he was a professor of the Secret Ukrainian University in Lviv and was secretary of its senate. From 1934 to 1939, he taught at the Greek Catholic Theological Academy. All of his major works during this period appeared in the Ukrainian and not the Polish language. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he remained active in various educational and public projects such as preserving the gravesites of fallen Ukrainian soldiers and promoting tourist literature about Ukrainian Galicia. From 1934, he was head of the Historical Section of the Shevchenko Scientific Society.\n\nUnlike many other students of Hrushevsky, Krypiakevych never politically or intellectually rebelled against the authority of his mentor, Mykhailo Hrushevsky. Although he did turn away from Hrushevsky's populism to a pro-state interpretation of Ukrainian history, he revered his mentor's memory and in 1935 published a short biography of him.\n\nThe 1939 fall of the Polish Republic and the Soviet annexation of Galicia brought far-reaching changes to academic as well as social and political life and Krypiakevych was appointed professor of history at the reorganized and partially Sovietized Lviv University.\n\nThe university was suppressed during the German occupation but Krypiakevych found work at the Ukrainian Publishing House in Lviv. Unlike many of his Galician Ukrainian colleagues, mostly for family reasons, he decided to remain in Lviv after the German retreat westwards.\n\nThe return of the Soviets brought renewed repressions to the west Ukrainian intelligentsia and in 1946 Krypiakevych was deported east to Kiev with many of his colleagues being accused in the Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism (see Soviet Union and Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism). For several years, he experienced political persecution, but in 1948, he was able to return to Lviv, and, with the help of the Soviet Ukrainian historian, Fedir Shevchenko, learned to adapt his historical writing to Soviet conditions and to the Soviet censors. From 1951, he headed the Institute of Social Sciences at the Lviv branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1958, he was elected an \"Academic\" of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. He died in 1967 in Lviv, a respected member of the Soviet Ukrainian historical profession. Ivan Krypiakevych was buried at Lychakivskiy Cemetery, Lviv.\n\nKrypiakevych's early works dealt with the early modern history of the City of Lviv and the social history of Galicia. Thereafter, he turned to the history of the Cossacks and published his dissertation on the Báthory reforms; he then undertook further studies of the Cossacks in international politics, and then the Cossack \"state\" created by Bohdan Khmelnytsky in 1648. Most of these works were published in the \"Memoirs of the Shevchenko Scientific Society.\"\n\nDuring the period of Polish ascendency, Krypiakevych co-authored and published many popularizations, the most important of which were his \"Great History of Ukraine\" (1935), his \"History of the Ukrainian Army\" (1936), and his \"History of Ukrainian Culture\" (1937). His textbooks of Ukrainian history were widely used both in Galicia and also among Ukrainians in North America. At this time, he also prepared a new scholarly \"History of Ukraine\" which was only published in 1949 in the west under the pseudonym 'Ivan Kholmsky'.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, Krypiakevych was known as an expert on the era of Khmelnytsky and on the occasion of the Three Hundredth Anniversary of the Treaty of Pereiaslav between the Cossacks and the Russian Tsar his \"Bohdan Khmelnytsky\" appeared in a very luxurious edition (1954). During the 1960s, he was very active at editing historical journals and mentoring younger Ukrainian historians, but a few years after his death in 1967, the Shelest Renaissance, which had briefly occurred under the protection of Ukrainian Communist Party leader, Petro Shelest, and had made possible so many of the cultural and academic achievements of the 1960s, came to an end (1972), and Krypiakevych's scholarly legacy was partly repressed. His monograph on the medieval Principality of Galicia-Volhynia only appeared posthumously in 1984.\n\nWith the emergence of the Gorbachev reforms and Ukrainian independence, his major works from pre-Soviet times were reprinted and uncensored editions of certain of his Soviet-era works like \"Bohdan Khmelnytsky\" were published. Today, he is widely revered as one of Hrushevsky's foremost students, a continuator of his tradition, and one of the most important historians of western Ukraine. The Institute of Ukrainian Studies of the National Academy of Sciences in Lviv is named in his honour.\n\nIn 1993 the Institute of Social Studies of Academy of Sciences of the UkrSSR in Lviv was renamed into the Krypiakevych Institute of Ukrainian Studies (National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine).\n\nIvan Krypiakevych had two sons who later became Ukrainian scientists.\n\nScholarly study of the life and work of Ivan Krypiakevych is only beginning, but see:\n\n\n"}

Josephus claimed the Jewish Messianic prophecies that initiated the First Roman-Jewish War made reference to Vespasian becoming Emperor of Rome. In response Vespasian decided to keep Josephus as a slave and presumably interpreter. After Vespasian became Emperor in 69 CE, he granted Josephus his freedom, at which time Josephus assumed the emperor's family name of Flavius.\n\nFlavius Josephus fully defected to the Roman side and was granted Roman citizenship. He became an advisor and friend of Vespasian's son Titus, serving as his translator when Titus led the Siege of Jerusalem. Since the siege proved ineffective at stopping the Jewish revolt, the city's destruction and the looting and destruction of Herod's Temple (Second Temple) soon followed.\n\nJosephus recorded Jewish history, with special emphasis on the first century CE and the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70 CE), including the Siege of Masada. His most important works were \"The Jewish War\" ( 75) and \"Antiquities of the Jews\" ( 94). \"The Jewish War\" recounts the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation. \"Antiquities of the Jews\" recounts the history of the world from a Jewish perspective for an ostensibly Greek and Roman audience. These works provide valuable insight into first century Judaism and the background of Early Christianity. (See main article Josephus on Jesus).\n\nBorn into one of Jerusalem's elite families, Josephus introduces himself in Greek as\" Iōsēpos\" (Ιώσηπος), son of Matthias, an ethnic Jewish priest. He was the second-born son of Matthias. His older full-blooded brother was also called Matthias. Their mother was an aristocratic woman who descended from the royal and formerly ruling Hasmonean dynasty. Josephus's paternal grandparents were Josephus and his wife—an unnamed Hebrew noblewoman, distant relatives of each other and direct descendants of Simon Psellus. Josephus's family was wealthy. He descended through his father from the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the 24 orders of priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. Josephus was a descendant of the high priest Jonathon. He was raised in Jerusalem and educated alongside his brother. \n\nIn his early twenties, he traveled to negotiate with Emperor Nero for the release of 12 Jewish priests. Upon his return to Jerusalem, at the outbreak of the First Jewish-Roman War, Josephus was appointed the military governor of Galilee, but eventually he strove with John of Gischala over the control of Galilee, who like Josephus, had amassed to himself a large band of supporters from Gischala (Gush Halab) and Gabara, including the support of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem. Josephus fortified several towns and villages in Galilee, among which were Tiberias, Bersabe and Tarichaea, in anticipation of a Roman onslaught, and valiantly resisted the Roman army in its siege of Yodfat (Jotapata) until it fell to the Roman army in the lunar month of Tammuz, in the thirteenth year of Nero's reign.\n\nAfter the Jewish garrison of Yodfat fell under siege, the Romans invaded, killing thousands; the survivors committed suicide. According to Josephus, he was trapped in a cave with 40 of his companions in July 67 CE. The Romans (commanded by Flavius Vespasian and his son Titus, both subsequently Roman emperors) asked the group to surrender, but they refused. Josephus suggested a method of collective suicide; they drew lots and killed each other, one by one, counting to every third person. Two men were left (this method as a mathematical problem is referred to as the Josephus problem, or Roman roulette), who surrendered to the Roman forces and became prisoners. In 69 CE, Josephus was released. According to his account, he acted as a negotiator with the defenders during the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE, in which his parents and first wife died.\n\nWhile being confined at Yodfat (Jotapata), Josephus claimed to have experienced a divine revelation that later led to his speech predicting Vespasian would become emperor. After the prediction came true, he was released by Vespasian, who considered his gift of prophecy to be divine. Josephus wrote that his revelation had taught him three things: that God, the creator of the Jewish people, had decided to \"punish\" them; that \"fortune\" had been given to the Romans; and that God had chosen him \"to announce the things that are to come\". To many Jews, such claims were simply self-serving.\n\nIn 71 CE, he went to Rome in the entourage of Titus, becoming a Roman citizen and client of the ruling Flavian dynasty (hence he is often referred to as Flavius Josephus). In addition to Roman citizenship, he was granted accommodation in conquered Judaea and a pension. While in Rome and under Flavian patronage, Josephus wrote all of his known works. Although he uses \"Josephus\", he appears to have taken the Roman praenomen Titus and nomen Flavius from his patrons. \n\nVespasian arranged for Josephus to marry a captured Jewish woman, whom he later divorced. About 71 CE, Josephus married an Alexandrian Jewish woman as his third wife. They had three sons, of whom only Flavius Hyrcanus survived childhood. Josephus later divorced his third wife. Around 75 CE, he married his fourth wife, a Greek Jewish woman from Crete, who was a member of a distinguished family. They had a happy married life and two sons, Flavius Justus and Flavius Simonides Agrippa.\n\nJosephus's life story remains ambiguous. He was described by Harris in 1985 as a law-observant Jew who believed in the compatibility of Judaism and Graeco-Roman thought, commonly referred to as Hellenistic Judaism. Before the 19th century, the scholar Nitsa Ben-Ari notes that his work was shunned like that of converts, then banned as those of a traitor, whose work was not to be studied or translated into Hebrew. His critics were never satisfied as to why he failed to commit suicide in Galilee, and after his capture, accepted the patronage of Romans.\n\nThe historian E. Mary Smallwood writes critically of Josephus:\n[Josephus] was conceited, not only about his own learning, but also about the opinions held of him as commander both by the Galileans and by the Romans; he was guilty of shocking duplicity at Jotapata, saving himself by sacrifice of his companions; he was too naive to see how he stood condemned out of his own mouth for his conduct, and yet no words were too harsh when he was blackening his opponents; and after landing, however involuntarily, in the Roman camp, he turned his captivity to his own advantage, and benefited for the rest of his days from his change of side.\n\nAuthor Joseph Raymond calls Josephus \"the Jewish Benedict Arnold\" for betraying his own troops at Jotapata.\n\nThe works of Josephus provide crucial information about the First Jewish-Roman War and also represent important literary source material for understanding the context of the Dead Sea Scrolls and late Temple Judaism.\n\nJosephan scholarship in the 19th and early 20th centuries took an interest in Josephus's relationship to the sect of the Pharisees. It consistently portrayed him as a member of the sect and as a traitor to the Jewish nation—a view which became known as the classical concept of Josephus. In the mid-20th century a new generation of scholars challenged this view and formulated the modern concept of Josephus. They consider him a Pharisee but restore his reputation in part as patriot and a historian of some standing. In his 1991 book, Steve Mason argued that Josephus was not a Pharisee but an orthodox Aristocrat-Priest who became associated with the philosophical school of the Pharisees as a matter of deference, and not by willing association.\n\nThe works of Josephus include useful material for historians about individuals, groups, customs, and geographical places. Some of these, such as the city of Seron, receive no mention in the surviving texts of any other ancient authority. His writings provide a significant, extra-Biblical account of the post-Exilic period of the Maccabees, the Hasmonean dynasty, and the rise of Herod the Great. He describes the Sadducees, Jewish High Priests of the time, Pharisees and Essenes, the Herodian Temple, Quirinius' census and the Zealots, and to such figures as Pontius Pilate, Herod the Great, Agrippa I and Agrippa II, John the Baptist, James the brother of Jesus, and to Jesus (for more see Josephus on Jesus). Josephus represents an important source for studies of immediate post-Temple Judaism and the context of early Christianity.\n\nA careful reading of Josephus's writings and years of excavation allowed Ehud Netzer, an archaeologist from Hebrew University, to discover what he considered to be the location of Herod's Tomb, after a search of 35 years. It was above aqueducts and pools, at a flattened desert site, halfway up the hill to the Herodium, 12 km south of Jerusalem—as described in Josephus's writings. In October 2013, archaeologists Joseph Patrich and Benjamin Arubas challenged the identification of the tomb as that of Herod. According to Patrich and Arubas, the tomb is too modest to be Herod's and has several unlikely features. Roi Porat, who replaced Netzer as excavation leader after the latter's death, stood by the identification.\n\nFor many years, the works of Josephus were largely known in Europe only in an imperfect Latin translation from the original Greek. Only in 1544 did a version of the standard Greek text become available in French, edited by the Dutch humanist Arnoldus Arlenius. The first English translation, by Thomas Lodge, appeared in 1602, with subsequent editions appearing throughout the 17th century. The 1544 Greek edition formed the basis of the 1732 English translation by William Whiston, which achieved enormous popularity in the English-speaking world. It was often the book—after the Bible—that Christians most frequently owned. A cross-reference apparatus for Whiston's version of Josephus and the biblical canon also exists. Whiston claimed that certain works by Josephus had a similar style to the Epistles of St Paul.\n\nLater editions of the Greek text include that of Benedikt Niese, who made a detailed examination of all the available manuscripts, mainly from France and Spain. Henry St. John Thackeray used Niese's version for the Loeb Classical Library edition widely used today.\n\nThe standard \"editio maior\" of the various Greek manuscripts is that of Benedictus Niese, published 1885–95. The text of \"Antiquities\" is damaged in some places. In the \"Life\", Niese follows mainly manuscript P, but refers also to AMW and R. Henry St. John Thackeray for the Loeb Classical Library has a Greek text also mainly dependent on P. André Pelletier edited a new Greek text for his translation of \"Life\". The ongoing Münsteraner Josephus-Ausgabe of Münster University will provide a new critical apparatus. There also exist late Old Slavonic translations of the Greek, but these contain a large number of Christian interpolations.\n\nScholars debate about Josephus's intended audience. For example, \"Antiquities of the Jews\" could be written for Jews—\"a few scholars from Laqueur onward have suggested that Josephus must have written primarily for fellow-Jews (if also secondarily for Gentiles). The most common motive suggested is repentance: in later life he felt so badly about the traitorous \"War\" that he needed to demonstrate … his loyalty to Jewish history, law and culture.\" However, Josephus's \"countless incidental remarks explaining basic Judean language, customs and laws … assume a Gentile audience. He does not expect his first hearers to know anything about the laws or Judean origins.\" The issue of who would read this multi-volume work is unresolved. Other possible motives for writing \"Antiquities\" could be to dispel the misrepresentation of Jewish origins or as an apologetic to Greek cities of the Diaspora in order to protect Jews and to Roman authorities to garner their support for the Jews facing persecution. Neither motive explains why the proposed Gentile audience would read this large body of material.\n\nIn the Preface to \"Jewish Wars\", Josephus criticizes historians who misrepresent the events of the Jewish–Roman War, writing that \"they have a mind to demonstrate the greatness of the Romans, while they still diminish and lessen the actions of the Jews.\" Josephus states that his intention is to correct this method but that he \"will not go to the other extreme … [and] will prosecute the actions of both parties with accuracy.\" Josephus suggests his method will not be wholly objective by saying he will be unable to contain his lamentations in transcribing these events; to illustrate this will have little effect on his historiography, Josephus suggests, \"But if any one be inflexible in his censures of me, let him attribute the facts themselves to the historical part, and the lamentations to the writer himself only.\"\n\nHis preface to \"Antiquities\" offers his opinion early on, saying, \"Upon the whole, a man that will peruse this history, may principally learn from it, that all events succeed well, even to an incredible degree, and the reward of felicity is proposed by God.\" After inserting this attitude, Josephus contradicts himself: \"I shall accurately describe what is contained in our records, in the order of time that belongs to them … without adding any thing to what is therein contained, or taking away any thing therefrom.\" He notes the difference between history and philosophy by saying, \"[T]hose that read my book may wonder how it comes to pass, that my discourse, which promises an account of laws and historical facts, contains so much of philosophy.\"\n\nIn both works, Josephus emphasizes that accuracy is crucial to historiography. Louis H. Feldman notes that in \"Wars\", Josephus commits himself to critical historiography, but in \"Antiquities\", Josephus shifts to rhetorical historiography, which was the norm of his time. Feldman notes further that it is significant that Josephus called his later work \"Antiquities\" (literally, archaeology) rather than history; in the Hellenistic period, archaeology meant either \"history from the origins or archaic history.\" Thus, his title implies a Jewish peoples' history from their origins until the time he wrote. This distinction is significant to Feldman, because \"in ancient times, historians were expected to write in chronological order,\" while \"antiquarians wrote in a systematic order, proceeding topically and logically\" and included all relevant material for their subject. Antiquarians moved beyond political history to include institutions and religious and private life. Josephus does offer this wider perspective in \"Antiquities\".\n\nTo compare his historiography with another ancient historian, consider Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Feldman lists these similarities: \"Dionysius in praising Rome and Josephus in praising Jews adopt same pattern; both often moralize and psychologize and stress piety and role of divine providence; and the parallels between … Dionysius's account of deaths of Aeneas and Romulus and Josephus's description of the death of Moses are striking.\"\n\nThe works of Josephus are major sources of our understanding of Jewish life and history during the first century.\n\nHis first work in Rome was an account of the Jewish War, addressed to certain \"upper barbarians\"—usually thought to be the Jewish community in Mesopotamia—in his \"paternal tongue\" (\"War\" I.3), arguably the Western Aramaic language. In 78 CE he finished a seven-volume account in Greek known as the \"Jewish War\" (Latin \"Bellum Judaicum\" or \"De Bello Judaico\"). It starts with the period of the Maccabees and concludes with accounts of the fall of Jerusalem, and the succeeding fall of the fortresses of Herodion, Macharont and Masada and the Roman victory celebrations in Rome, the mopping-up operations, Roman military operations elsewhere in the empire and the uprising in Cyrene. Together with the account in his \"Life\" of some of the same events, it also provides the reader with an overview of Josephus's own part in the events since his return to Jerusalem from a brief visit to Rome in the early 60s (\"Life\" 13–17).\n\nIn the wake of the suppression of the Jewish revolt, Josephus would have witnessed the marches of Titus's triumphant legions leading their Jewish captives, and carrying treasures from the despoiled Temple in Jerusalem. It was against this background that Josephus wrote his \"War\", claiming to be countering anti-Judean accounts. He disputes the claim that the Jews served a defeated God and were naturally hostile to Roman civilization. Rather, he blames the Jewish War on what he calls \"unrepresentative and over-zealous fanatics\" among the Jews, who led the masses away from their traditional aristocratic leaders (like himself), with disastrous results. Josephus also blames some of the Roman governors of Judea, representing them as corrupt and incompetent administrators. According to Josephus, the traditional Jew was, should be, and can be a loyal and peace-loving citizen. Jews can, and historically have, accepted Rome's hegemony precisely because their faith declares that God himself gives empires their power.\n\nThe next work by Josephus is his twenty-one volume \"Antiquities of the Jews\", completed during the last year of the reign of the Emperor Flavius Domitian, around 93 or 94 CE. In expounding Jewish history, law and custom, he is entering into many philosophical debates current in Rome at that time. Again he offers an \"apologia\" for the antiquity and universal significance of the Jewish people. Josephus claims to be writing this history because he \"saw that others perverted the truth of those actions in their writings,\" those writings being the history of the Jews. In terms of some of his sources for the project, Josephus says that he drew from and \"interpreted out of the Hebrew Scriptures\" and that he was an eyewitness to the wars between the Jews and the Romans, which were earlier recounted in \"Jewish Wars\".\n\nHe outlines Jewish history beginning with the creation, as passed down through Jewish historical tradition. Abraham taught science to the Egyptians, who, in turn, taught the Greeks. Moses set up a senatorial priestly aristocracy, which, like that of Rome, resisted monarchy. The great figures of the Tanakh are presented as ideal philosopher-leaders. He includes an autobiographical appendix defending his conduct at the end of the war when he cooperated with the Roman forces.\n\nLouis H. Feldman outlines the difference between calling this work \"Antiquities of the Jews\" instead of \"History of the Jews\". Although Josephus says that he describes the events contained in \"Antiquities\" \"in the order of time that belongs to them,\" Feldman argues that Josephus \"aimed to organize [his] material systematically rather than chronologically\" and had a scope that \"ranged far beyond mere political history to political institutions, religious and private life.\"\n\nJosephus's \"Against Apion\" is a two-volume defence of Judaism as classical religion and philosophy, stressing its antiquity, as opposed to what Josephus claimed was the relatively more recent tradition of the Greeks. Some anti-Judaic allegations ascribed by Josephus to the Greek writer Apion, and myths accredited to Manetho are also addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They were originally from Baler but they moved to Leyte in 1860 when Soledad's father, an officer in the artillery corps, was transferred.\n\nIn 1874 his mother moved back to Manila. Manuel attended Colegio de la Immaculada Concepcion. He transferred to the Ateneo Municipal as an alumno interno de beca. He took up undergraduate studies in medicine at University of Santo Tomas. After three years he transferred to Colegio de San Juan de Letran. In 1883 he became a civil servant.\n\nTo supplement his income, Artigas wrote prolifically, basing many of his works on important archival materials:\n\n• El Municipio Filipino (a collection of laws of Manila)\n\n• Historia Municipal de Filipinas desde los Primeros Tiempos de la Dominacion Española hasta nuestros Dias (1894, 2 vols)\n\n• Los Sucesos de 1872 (Manila, 1911)\n\n• Reseña de la Provincia de Leyte (Manila, 1914)\n\n• El Procedimento Administrativo y la Jurisdiccion Centencioso-Administivo y la Jurisdiction en Filipinas\n\n• Diccionario Tecnico-histerico de la Administracion de Filipinas-Manila\n\n• Historia de las Revoluciones Filipinas\n\n• Historia de Filipinas (Manila, 1916)\n\n• El Parlamento Filipino-Manila\n\n• La Primera Imprenta del Filipinas-Manila\n\n• El General Antonio Luna Novicio\n\n• Reseña Historica dela Universidad de Santo Tomas de Manila\n\n• Historia de la Instruccion Publica en Filipinas\n\n• Bibliografia Medico-Famtaceutica.\n\nHe was recognized because of his incessant writings and in 1907, he became assistant librarian in the Philippine Section of the American Circulating Library.

Her first monograph, \"Eugenics and Modernization in Interwar Romania\" (2002), examined the intellectual debates and policy-making activities of a group of doctors, lawyers, biologists, anthropologists, and politicians who used eugenicist ideas to propel Romanian society and institutions to a level of modernization in social engineering akin to attempts made in Germany and other West European states during the same period. Her second monograph, \"Heroes and Victims: Remembering War in Twentieth-Century Romania\" (2009), offered a close examination of various forms of remembering and commemorating the two world wars from 1918 onwards, with a focus on the tensions between grassroots and individual efforts (autobiographical writing, funerary monuments, commemorative plaques) and state-initiated commemorations (military cemeteries, official remembrance day commemorations, films). With a focus on the different meanings embodied in these various efforts, Bucur illuminates the important role played by such contestations in shaping the meaning of heroism, patriotism, and self-sacrifice along gender, regional, and ethno-religious lines. More recently, she has published \"Gendering Modernism: A Historical Reappraisal of the Canon\" (2017), which asks readers to reconsider the revolutionary aspects of modernism from the perspective gender norms.\n\nIn 2018 she is publishing two new books. \"The Century of Women: How Women Have Transformed the World Since 1900\" is a bold overview of recent history from a feminist humanist perspective, placing women's historical empowerment at the heart of understanding recent changes in politics, economics, demography, culture, and knowledge making. Karen Offen, of Stanford University, calls it a book that \"should find a place on every intelligent person's reading list.\" Her newest monograph, co-authored with Mihaela Miroiu, \"Birth of Democratic Citizenship: Women in Modern Romania\", will come out in November 2018 with Indiana University Press.\n\nIn addition to these monographs and other co-edited volumes, she has published over seventy articles and chapters in a variety of outlets, from \"The American Historical Review\" to the \"Times Literary Supplement\".

Together with her colleague Christina Zarifopol-Illias, she worked to establish the first Romanian Studies graduate fellowship in the United States at Indiana University. She has worked with various partners in Romania. At Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, together with a team of scholars from Indiana University and the Central European University, she helped launch the Oral History Center in 1997. She has worked with colleagues at the National School for Political Science and Public Administration in Bucharest on a several research and publication projects, and also taught several graduate workshops. She has collaborated with Transylvania University in Brașov and the Aspera foundation on two oral history workshops. In addition to these academic events, she has worked with artists and musicians to promote visibility for Romanian culture.\n\nBucur is the recipient of numerous grants and fellowships, among them two National Endowments for the Humanities research grants, a research fellowship from the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, DC, and a fellowship from the American Association for University Women.

Therefore, May in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of November in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. Late May typically marks the of the summer vacation season in the United States and Canada and ends on Labor Day, the first Monday of September.\n\nThe month of May (in Latin, \"Maius\") was named for the Greek Goddess Maia, who was identified with the Roman era goddess of fertility, Bona Dea, whose festival was held in May. Conversely, the Roman poet Ovid provides a second etymology, in which he says that the month of May is named for the \"maiores,\" Latin for \"elders,\" and that the following month (June) is named for the \"iuniores,\" or \"young people\" (\"Fasti VI.88\").\n\nMayovka, in the context of the late Russian Empire, was a picnic in the countryside or in a park in the early days of May, hence the name. Eventually, \"mayovka\" (specifically, \"proletarian mayovka\") came to mean an illegal celebration of May 1 by revolutionary public, typically presented as an innocent picnic.\n\nSpecial devotions to the Virgin Mary take place in May. See May devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nEta Aquariids meteor shower appears in May. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The Arietids shower from May 22 – July 2, and peaks on June 7. The Virginids also shower at various dates in May.\n\nUnder the calendar of ancient Rome, the festival of Bona Dea fell on May 1, Argei fell on May 14 or May 15, Agonalia fell on May 21, and Ambarvalia on May 29. Floralia was held April 27 during the Republican era, or April 28 on the Julian calendar, and lasted until May 3. Lemuria (festival) fell on 9,11, and 13 May under the Julian calendar. The College of Aesculapius and Hygia celebrated two festivals of Rosalia (festival), one on May 11 and one on May 22. Rosalia was also celebrated at Pergamon on May 24–26. A military Rosalia festival, Rosaliae signorum, also occurred on May 31. Ludi Fabarici was celebrated on May 29 – June 1. Mercury would receive a sacrifice on the Ides of May (May 15).

He completed his studies at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy in 1899 and then taught for a year at a secondary school. Afterwards, he moved to Paris and spent two years there studying literature, theatre and art. He returned to Serbia in 1902 and found work as a teacher at the National Theatre in Belgrade. Alongside writers such as Jovan Skerlić, Radoje Domanović and Stevan M. Luković, Grol wrote many articles critical of King Alexander I in newspapers such as \"Dnevni list\" (Daily Paper) and \"Odjek\" (Echo). In April 1903, he was transferred to Negotin because of his opposition to Serbia's ruling Obrenović dynasty. He returned to Belgrade on 29 May 1903, following the May Overthrow which led to the extinction of the Obrenović dynasty and the restoration of the Karađorđević dynasty to the Serbian throne. Politically, Grol identified with a group of left-wing urban democrats led by Ljubomir Živković, Ljubomir Stojanović and Jaša Prodanović. This movement separated from the People's Radical Party and later became the Independent Radical Party. After 1903, Grol continued to work with Skerlić, first as a journalist, and, from 1905 to 1909, as the editor of \"Dnevni list\", which represented the left-wing ideals of the Independent Radical Party. Grol became a dramatist at the National Theatre and remained in that position until 1906. He taught for three more years before becoming the director of the National Theatre in 1909. From 1912 to 1914, he was the editor-in-chief of \"Odjek\". Grol joined the main committee of the Independent Radical Party in 1913.\n\nGrol remained director of the National Theatre until the outbreak of World War I in the summer of 1914. The war prompted him to relocate to Geneva, where he headed the Serbian Press Bureau from 1915 until 1918. After World War I, he and politician Ljubomir Davidović founded the Democratic Association, which later became the Democratic Party. Grol was again named director of the National Theatre in 1918, and held this position until 1924. In 1922, he and Kosta Jovanović founded the \"Nedeljni glasnik\" (Sunday Herald), which called for constitutional reform, the lessening of centralism, and more political agreement between Croatia and Serbia. Following the outbreak of a political crisis with the Democratic Party, Grol began editing \"Odjek\" again and split with Davidović following Svetozar Pribićević's departure from the party. Grol was twice elected to the parliament of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, in 1925 and 1927. He was a member of a Yugoslav coalition government consisting of Democrats, Radicals and the Slovene People's Party, and served as Minister of Education until 1929, when he reunited with Davidović and joined the opposition. In 1929, Grol joined the Kolarčeve Foundation Committee and organized the Kolarčev People's University in Belgrade. He began publishing \"Odjek\" again in 1936. Following Davidović's death in 1940, Grol became president of the Democratic Party. He became the Kolarčev People's University first director in 1941. He joined the government of Dušan Simović in March 1941 and went into exile following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia that April.\n\nGrol held various posts in the Yugoslav government-in-exile during World War II in London: Minister for Social Welfare and Public Health, from 27 March to January 1942; Minister of Transport, from 10 January 1942 to 26 June 1943; and Minister of Foreign Affairs, from 26 June to 10 August 1943.\n\nIn the first half of 1944, Serb politicians in the government-in-exile attempted to convince King Peter to appoint Grol to replace Božidar Purić as Prime Minister, but British pressure resulted in the appointment of a non-Serb, Dr. Ivan Šubašić, who would be willing to remove Draža Mihailović from his post as Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The British had assessed that no Serb politician would be in a position to remove Mihailović. In February 1945, prior to the return of the government-in-exile to Yugoslavia, King Peter named Grol as a member of the regency to be formed under the Tito-Šubašić agreement, however Tito would not accept Grol in the regency, and he was ultimately not appointed. When the government-in-exile returned to Yugoslavia in March 1945 and merged with the interim Partisan government, Grol became vice premier without portfolio in the unified government under Prime Minister Tito. On 18 August 1945, Grol resigned his cabinet post because the communists failed to observe the conditions that had been agreed upon with the government-in-exile when the unified government was established.\n\nGrol tried to re-publish the pre-war Democratic Party magazine called \"Demokratija\", but was blocked by the Partisans. He was placed under house arrest in November 1945, and withdrew from public life after the introduction of communist rule. He testified at the trial of Draža Mihailović. \n\n\n\n"}

As legate to Quintus Mucius Scaevola, he attempted to protect the inhabitants of Asia from extortion by the equites, which led to him being falsely accused of extorting those provincials. The charge was false, but as the juries were chosen from the equestrian order, he was condemned. He was exiled, and went to Smyrna, where he wrote a history of Rome in Greek.\n\nHe was the third child of a Publius Rutilius, the other children being called Lucius and Rutilia (mother of Caius Cotta). Rufus studied philosophy under Panaetius (becoming a Stoic), law, public speaking under Sulpicius Galba, and Greek.\n\nHe started his military career in 134 BC, as a member of the staff of Scipio Africanus Minor during the Numantine War. Later on, Rufus was a legate of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus in the campaign against Jugurtha of Numidia of 109 BC, along with Gaius Marius. He distinguished himself in the Battle of the Muthul, where he faced a charge by the foe Bomilcar and managed to capture or maim most of the Numidian war elephants.\n\nIn 115 BC Rufus was defeated for the consulship by Scaurus and prosecuted him for ambitus. Scaurus in turn prosecuted Rufus for the same charge. Both charges failed. In 105 BC he was elected to the consulship as a senior partner of Gnaeus Mallius Maximus. His main achievements concerned the discipline of the army and the introduction of an improved system of drill. Subsequently, he served as legate to Quintus Mucius Scaevola, governor of Asia.\n\nBy assisting his superior in his efforts to protect the inhabitants of Asia from the extortions of the \"publicani\", or farmers of taxes, Rufus incurred the hatred of the equestrian order, to which the \"publicani\" belonged. In 92 BC he was charged with extorting money from the provincials, although he had made efforts to prevent them from being extorted. The charge was widely known to be false, but as the juries at that time were chosen from the equestrian order, he was condemned, as the order bore a grudge against him. Famous Roman gourmand Apicius had a hand in his demise. His property was confiscated to satisfy claims for compensation.\nHe retired to Mytilene, and afterwards to Smyrna, where he spent the rest of his life (possibly as an act of defiance against his prosecutors: he was welcomed with honour into the very city for which he was prosecuted as allegedly looting), and where Cicero visited him as late as the year 78 BC. Although invited by Lucius Cornelius Sulla to return to Rome, Rufus refused to do so. It was during his stay at Smyrna that he wrote his autobiography and a history of Rome in Greek, part of which is known to have been devoted to the Numantine War. He possessed a thorough knowledge of law, and wrote treatises on that subject, some fragments of which are quoted in the Digests. He was also well acquainted with Greek literature.\n\nAccording to Professor Levinthal, in an article from 1918, Rutilius happened to be a revolutionary for bankruptcy proceedings.\n"}

{"id": "22706403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22706403", "title": "Sutton Hoo helmet", "text": "Sutton Hoo helmet\n\nThe Sutton Hoo helmet is a decorated Anglo-Saxon helmet which was discovered during the 1939 excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial. It was buried around 625 and is widely believed to have been the helmet of King Rædwald of East Anglia, and its elaborate decoration may have given it a secondary function akin to a crown. The helmet is \"the most iconic object\" from \"one of the most spectacular archaeological discoveries ever made,\" and one of the most important Anglo-Saxon artefacts ever found. Its visage features eyebrows, nose, and moustache, creating the image of a man joined by a dragon's head to become a soaring dragon with outstretched wings. It has become a symbol of the Dark Ages and also \"of Archaeology in general.\" It was excavated as hundreds of rusted fragments, and was first displayed following an initial reconstruction in 1945–46, and then in its present form after a second reconstruction in 1970–71.\n\nThe helmet and the other finds from Sutton Hoo were determined by a treasure trove inquest to be the property of Edith Pretty, who owned the site of the ship-burial. She donated all the objects to the British Museum, where they were conserved and put on display. The helmet was on view in Room 41 in 2018.\n\nThe helmet was buried among other regalia and instruments of power as part of a furnished ship-burial, probably dating from the early seventh century. Although the man in the grave has not been identified, the contents of the grave point to its being that of a king. It is generally thought most likely that Rædwald, the ruler of the East Angles, is the person buried in the ship, due to the proximity of the royal vill of Rendlesham and as use of the site is believed to have been a time when he held power in England.\n\nThe ship had been hauled from the nearby river up the hill and lowered into a prepared trench. Inside this, the helmet was wrapped in cloths and placed to the left of the head of the body. An oval mound was constructed around the ship. Long afterwards, the chamber roof collapsed violently under the weight of the mound, compressing the ship's contents into a seam of earth.\n\nIt is thought that the helmet was shattered either by the collapse of the burial chamber or by the force of another object falling on it. The fact that the helmet had shattered meant that it was possible to reconstruct it. Had the helmet been crushed before the iron had fully oxidised, leaving it still pliant, the helmet would have been squashed, leaving it in a distorted shape similar to the Vendel and Valsgärde helmets.\n\nThe Sutton Hoo helmet, weighing an estimated , was made of iron and covered with decorated sheets of tinned bronze. Fluted strips of moulding divided the exterior into panels, each of which was stamped with one of five designs. Two depict figural scenes, another two zoophormic interlaced patterns; a fifth pattern, known only from seven small fragments and incapable of restoration, is only known to occur once on an otherwise symmetrical helmet and may have been used to replace a damaged panel. The existence of these five designs has been generally understood since the first reconstruction, published in 1947. The succeeding three decades gave rise to an increased understanding of the designs and their parallels in contemporary imagery, allowing possible reconstructions of the full panels to be advanced, and through the second reconstruction their locations on the surface of the helmet to be redetermined. As referred to below, the designs are numbered according to Rupert Bruce-Mitford's 1978 work.\n\nThe core of the helmet was constructed of iron and consisted of a cap from which hung a face mask and cheek and neck guards. The cap was \"beaten up out of a single piece of metal.\" On either side of it were hung iron cheek guards, deep enough to \"completely protect the side of the face\" and curved inward \"both longitudinally and laterally.\" Two hinges per side, possibly made of leather, supported these pieces, allowing them to be pulled flush with the face mask and \"completely enclose\" the face. A neck guard was attached to the back of the cap and made of two overlapping pieces: a shorter piece set inside the cap, over which attached a \"broad fan-like portion\" extending downwards, \"straight from top to bottom but curved laterally to follow the line of the neck.\" The inset portion afforded the neck guard extra movement, and like the cheek guards was attached to the cap by leather hinges. Finally, the face mask was riveted to the cap on both sides and above the nose. Two cutouts served as eye openings, while a third opened into the hollow of the overlaid nose, thereby facilitating access to the two nostril-like holes underneath; though small, these holes would have been among the few sources of fresh air for the wearer.\n\nAtop the foundational layer of iron were placed decorative sheets of tinned bronze. These sheets, divided into five figural or zoomorphic designs, were manufactured by the \"pressblech\" process. Preformed dies similar to the Torslunda plates were covered with thin metal which, through applied force, took up the design underneath; identical designs could thus be \"mass-produced\" from the same die, allowing for their repeated use on the helmet and other objects. Fluted strips of white alloyed moulding—possibly of tin and copper, and possibly swaged—divided the designs into framed panels, held to the helmet by bronze rivets. The two strips running from front to back alongside the crest were gilded. The edges of the helmet were further protected by U-shaped brass tubing, fastened by swaged bronze clips and themselves further holding in place the \"pressblech\" panels that shared edges with the helmet.\n\nA final layer of adornments added to the helmet a crest, eyebrows, nose and mouth piece, and three dragon heads. A hollow iron crest ran across the top of the cap and terminated at front and back. It was made of \"D-sectioned\" tubing and consisted of two parts, an inverted \"U-shaped\" piece into which a \"flat bottom strip\" was placed. As no traces of solder remain, the crest may have been either forged or shrunk on to the cap. From either end of the crest extended an iron tang, to each of which was riveted a gilded dragon head. That on the front was made of cast bronze, while the one on the rear was made of \"a different alloy, and now consists largely of tin oxide.\" A third dragon head, also of cast bronze, faced upwards on the front of the helmet and broke the plane between face mask and cap; its neck rested on the face mask, while under its eyes it was held to the cap by \"a massive rivet shank.\" To either side of the neck projected a hollow cast bronze eyebrow, into each of which was inlaid parallel silver wires. Terminal boar heads were gilded, as were the undersides of the eyebrows, where individual bronze cells held square garnets. The eyebrows were riveted on, both to the cap at their outer ends and to the tang of a nose and mouth piece which extended upwards underneath the neck of the dragon head. This tang was itself riveted to the cap, one of five attachment points for the cast bronze nose and mouth piece. Both sides of the nose featured \"two small round projecting plates,\" connected by fluted and swaged strips, and concealing rivets. An inlaid strip of wire extended the length of the nasal ridge, next to which the \"background was punched down\" and filled with niello or another metallic inlay, leaving \"triangles in relief\" that were silvered. A tracer (a \"rather blunt chisel . . . used chiefly for outlining\") was used to provide a grooved border on each side. Running horizontally aside the nasal bridge were three punched circles per side, inlaid with silver and possibly surrounded by niello. Beneath these circles, also running horizontally from the center of the nose to its sides were chased \"alternate rows of plain flutings and billeted strips which run obliquely between the central strip and a billeted lower edge.\" This same pattern is repeated in vertical fashion on the moustache. The curve along the bevelled lower lip, in turn, repeats the circled pattern used on the nasal bridge. Excepting the portions covered by the eyebrows and dragon head, or adorned with silver or niello, the nose and mouth piece was heavily gilded, which is suggested by the presence of mercury to have been done with the fire-gilding method.\n\nBreaking the symmetry of the helmet are subtle differences in the two eyebrows, and in the methods employed to fashion the cloisonné garnets. The dexter and sinister eyebrows, though at first glance identical, may have been \"manufactured in different ways while being intended to look essentially the same.\" The dexter brow is approximately 5 millimeters shorter than the sinister, and contained 43 rather than 46 inlaid silver wires and one or two fewer garnets. Gilding on the dexter eyebrow was \"reddish in colour\" against the \"yellowish\" hue of the sinister, while the latter contains both trace amounts of mercury and a tin corrosion product which are absent from its counterpart. Moreover, while the individual bronze cells into which the garnets are set, both on the dexter brow and on three of the four remaining dragon eyes, are underlain by small pieces of \"hatched gold foil,\" those on the sinister side, and the sinister eye of the upper dragon head, have no such backing. The gold backing served to reflect light back through the garnets, increasing their lustre and deepening their colour. Where this backing was missing on the sinister eyebrow and one dragon eye, the luminosity of the garnets would be \"substantially dimmed\" by direct placement against the bronze.\n\nThree dragon heads are represented on the helmet. Two bronze-gilt dragon heads feature on either end of the iron crest running from the front to the rear of the skull cap. The third sits at the junction between the two eyebrows, facing upward and given fuller form by the eyebrows, nose and moustache to create the impression of a dragon in flight. There it soars upwards in the \"central and most dramatic feature of the entire helmet,\" baring its teeth at the \"snake-like dragon\" flying down the crest.\n\nTo the extent that the helmet is jewelled, such decoration is largely confined to the elements associated with the dragons. Convex garnets sunk into the heads give the dragons red eyes. The eyebrows are likewise inlaid with square garnets on their under edges, continuing outwards on each side to where they terminate in gilded boars' heads; in addition to their secondary decorative function as wings, the eyebrows may therefore take on a tertiary form as boars' bodies. The subtle differences between the eyebrows, the sinister of which lacks the gold foil backing employed on the dexter, may suggest an allusion to the one-eyed god Odin; seen in low light, with the garnets of only one eye reflecting light, the helmet may have itself seemed to have only one eye.\n\nMore gold covers the eyebrows, nose and mouth piece, and dragon heads, as it does the two fluted strips that flank the crest. The crest and eyebrows are further inlaid with silver wires. Combined with the silvery colour of the tinned bronze, the effect was \"an object of burnished silvery metal, set in a trelliswork of gold, surmounted by a crest of massive silver, and embellished with gilded ornaments, garnets and nielloin its way a magnificent thing and one of the outstanding masterpieces of barbaric art.\"\n\nThe dancing warriors scene is known from six fragments and occurs four times on the helmet. It is seen on the two panels immediately above the eyebrows, accounting for five of the fragments. The sixth fragment is placed in the middle row of the dexter cheek guard, on the panel closest to the face mask; the generally symmetrical nature of the helmet implies the design's position on the opposite side as well. None of the six pieces show both warriors, although the \"key fragment\" depicts their crossed wrists. A full reconstruction of the scene was inferred after the first reconstruction, when Rupert Bruce-Mitford spent six weeks in Sweden and was shown a nearly identical design on the then unpublished Valsgärde 7 helmet.\n\nDesign 1 pictures two men \"in civilian or ceremonial dress\" perhaps engaged in a spear or sword dance \"associated with the cult of Odin, the war-god.\" Their outer hands each hold two spears, pointed towards their feet, while their crossed hands grip swords. The depiction suggests \"intricate measures,\" \"rhythm,\" and an \"elasticity of . . . dance steps.\" Their trailing outer legs and curved hips imply movement towards each other, and they may be in the climax of the dance. The prevalence of dance scenes with a \"similarity of the presentation of the scheme of movement\" in contemporary Scandinavian and Northern art suggests that ritual dances \"were well-known phenomena.\" Sword dances in particular were recorded among the Germanic tribes as early as the first century AD, when Tacitus wrote of \"[n]aked youths who practice the sport bound in the dance amid swords and lances,\" a \"spectacle\" which was \"always performed at every gathering.\" Whatever the meaning conveyed by the Sutton Hoo example, the \"ritual dance was evidently no freak of fashion confined to a particular epoch, but was practised for centuries in a more or less unchanged form.\"\n\nWhile many contemporary designs portray ritual dances, at least three examples show scenes exceptionally similar to that on the Sutton Hoo helmet and contribute to the understanding of the depicted sword dance. The same design—identical but for a different type of spears held in hand, a different pattern of dress, and a lack of crossed spears behind the two men—is found on the Valsgärde 7 helmet, while a small fragment of stamped foil from the eastern mound at Gamla Uppsala is \"so close in every respect to the corresponding warrior on the Sutton Hoo helmet as to appear at first glance to be from the same die,\" and may even have been \"cut by the same man.\" The third similar design is one of the four Torslunda plates, discovered in Öland, Sweden, in 1870. This plate, which is complete and depicts a figure with the same attributes as on design 1, suggests the association of the men in the Sutton Hoo example with \"the cult of Odin.\" The Torslunda figure is missing an eye, which laser scanning revealed to have been removed by a \"sharp cut, probably in the original model used for the mould.\" Odin too lost an eye, thus evidencing the identification of the Torslunda figure as him, and the Sutton Hoo figures as devotees of him.\n\nEight fragments represent all known instances of the second design, accounting for its placement on a like number of panels. It is surmised to have originally appeared twelve times on the helmet, although this theory assumes that the unidentified third design, which occupies one of the twelve panels, was a replacement for a damaged panel. Assuming so, the pattern occupied eight spaces on the lowest row of the skull cap (i.e., all but the two showing design 1), and two panels, one atop the other rising towards the crest, in the centre of each side. All panels showing design 2 appear to have been struck from the same die. The horse and rider thus move in a clockwise direction around the helmet, facing towards the rear of the helmet on the dexter side, and towards the front on the sinister side.\n\nAs substantial sections of design 2 are missing, particularly from the \"central area,\" reconstruction relies in part on continental versions of the same scene. In particular, similar scenes are seen on the Valsgärde 7 and 8 helmets, the Vendel 1 helmet, and on the Pliezhausen bracteate. The latter piece, in particular, is both complete and nearly identical to the Sutton Hoo design. Although a mirror image, and lacking in certain details depicted in design 2 such as the sword carried by the rider and the scabbard worn by the fallen warrior, it suggests other details such as the small shield held by the kneeling figure.\n\nDesign 2 shows a mounted warrior, spear held overhead, trampling an enemy on the ground. The latter leans upwards and, grasping the reins in his left hand, uses his right hand to thrust a sword into the chest of the horse. Atop the horse's rump kneels a \"diminutive human, or at least anthropomorphic figure.\" The figure is stylistically similar to the horseman. Its arms and legs are positioned identically, and, together with the rider, it clutches the spear with its right hand.\n\nThe iconographic meaning of design 2 is unknown. It may derive from Roman models, which frequently depicted images of warriors trampling vanquished enemies. The subsequent development of the design, which has been found in England, Sweden, and Germany, suggests that it carried a unique meaning broadly understood in Germanic tradition. Whereas the Roman examples show riders in moments of unqualified victory, in Germanic representations the scene is ambiguous. The symbolism is unclear, and elements of victory are combined with elements of defeat: the rider directs his spear straight forward at an invisible enemy, not down at the visible enemy on the ground; though the enemy is trampled, the rider's horse is dealt a fatal wound; and a small and possibly divine figure hovers behind the rider, its body taking the form of a victorious swastika while it seemingly guides the spear. An overarching theme of the design may therefore be that of fate. In this understanding the divine figure, possibly Odin, guides the warrior in battle, but does not completely free him from the deadly threats he faces. The gods are themselves subject to the whims of fate, and can provide only limited help against the rider's enemies.\n\nSeven small fragments suggest a third figural scene somewhere on the Sutton Hoo helmet. They are nevertheless too small and ambiguous to allow for the reconstruction of the scene. Its presence is suggested \"not more than four times, and perhaps only once\"; because other fragments demonstrate the occurrence of design 1 or design 2 on all seven available panels on the sinister side of the helmet, and on the forwardmost two panels on the dexter side (in addition to on the highest dexter panel), placement of design 3 \"must have occurred towards the rear of the helmet\" on the dexter side.\n\nThat which remains of design 3 may suggest that a \"variant rider scene\" was employed to fix damage to a design 2 panel, similar to how a unique \"pressblech\" design on the Valsgärde 6 helmet was likely used in repair. Fragment (a) for example shows groups of parallel raised lines running in correspondence \"with changes of angle or direction in the modelled surface, which on the analogy of the Sutton Hoo and other rider scenes in Vendel art, strongly suggest the body of a horse.\" Though smaller, fragment (d) shows similar patterns and suggests a similar interpretation. Fragment (b), meanwhile, shows \"two concentric raised lines two millimetres apart,\" and \"appears to be a segment of the rim of a shield which would be of the same diameter as that held by the rider in design 2.\"\n\nThe theory of design 3 as a replacement panel gains some support from damage towards the back of the helmet, yet is contradicted by the placement of fragment (c). The crest, complete for from front to back, is missing above the rear dragon head. This head is itself mostly missing, and was entirely omitted from the 1945–46 reconstruction. These missing portions are offered by Bruce-Mitford as a possible indication that the helmet at one time suffered damage necessitating the restoration of at least one design 2 panel with a new equestrian scene. This theory does not explain why the rear crest and dragon head would not have been themselves repaired, however, and it is not helped by fragment (c). This fragment is an edge piece placed in the 1970–71 reconstruction on the dexter rear of the helmet at the bottom left of a panel where either design 2 or design 3 is expected, yet is \"an isolated element quite out of context with any other surviving fragment and with what appears to be the subject matter of the design 3 panel.\" Bruce-Mitford suggests that as it is an edge piece it may have originally been a scrap placed under another piece to fill a gap, for it is \"otherwise inexplicable.\"\n\nOccurring on the cheek guards, the neck guard and the skull cap, the larger interlace pattern was capable of a complete reconstruction. Unlike the two identified figural scenes, partial die impressions of design 4 were used in addition to full die impressions. Blank spaces on the skull cap and neck guard, devoid of decorative designs, allowed for impressions of design 4 \"that are either complete or nearly so.\" On the cheek guards, by contrast, which are irregularly shaped and fully decorated, \"the interlace designs are trimmed and sometimes turned on edge to fill awkward spaces.\"\n\nDesign 4 depicts \"a single quadruped in ribbon style.\"\n\nThe smaller interlace pattern covered the face mask, was used prominently on the neck guard, and filled in several empty spaces on the cheek guards. It is a zoomorphic design, like the larger interlace, and shows \"two animals, upside down and reversed in relation to each other, whose backward-turning heads lie towards the centre of the panel.\"\n\nThe Sutton Hoo helmet was both a functional piece of battle equipment and a symbol of its owner's power and prestige. It would have offered considerable protection if ever used in battle, and at the same time, being the richest known Anglo-Saxon helmet, would have indicated its owner's status. As it is older than the man with whom it was buried, the helmet may also have been an heirloom, symbolic of the ceremonies of its owner's life and death; it may further be a progenitor of crowns, known in Europe since around the twelfth century, indicating both a leader's right to rule and his connection with the gods.\n\nWhether or not the helmet was ever worn in battle is unknown, but though delicately ornamented, it would have done the job well. Other than leaving spaces to allow movement of the shoulders and arms, the helmet leaves its wearer's head entirely protected, and unlike any other known helmet of its general type, it has a face mask, one-piece cap, and solid neck guard. The iron and silver crest would have helped deflect the force of falling blows, and holes underneath the nose would have created a breathable—if stifling—environment within. If two suppositions are to be taken as true—that damage to the back of the helmet occurred before the burial, and that Raedwald is properly identified as the helmet's owner—then the helmet can be at least described as one that saw some degree of use during its lifetime, and that was owned by a person who saw battle; according to Bede, around 616 Raedwald defeated Æthelfrith of Northumbria in the Battle of the River Idle.\n\nBeyond its functional purpose, the Sutton Hoo helmet would have served to convey the high status of its owner. Little more than an iron cap, such as the helmets from Shorwell and Wollaston, would be needed if one only sought to protect one's head. Yet helmets were also objects of prestige in Anglo-Saxon England, as indicated by archaeological, literary, and historical evidence. Helmets are relatively common in \"Beowulf\", an Anglo-Saxon poem focused on royals and their aristocratic milieu, but rarely found today; only six are currently known, despite the excavation of thousands of graves from the period. Much as this could also be reflective of poor rates of artefact survival, or even recognition—the Shorwell helmet was at first misidentified as a \"fragmentary iron vessel\", the Wollaston helmet as a bucket, and a plain Roman helmet from Burgh Castle as \"cauldron fragments\"—the extreme scarcity suggests that helmets were never deposited in great numbers, and signified the importance of those wearing them.\n\nThat the Sutton Hoo helmet was likely around 100 years old when buried suggests that it may also have been an heirloom, a sample from the royal treasury passed down from another generation. The same suggestion has been made for the shield from the burial, as both it and the helmet are objects with distinct Swedish influence. The importance of heirloom items is well documented in poetry; every sword of note in \"Beowulf\", from Hrunting to Nægling, has such a history, and the poem's hero, whose own pyre is stacked with helmets, uses his dying words to bestow upon his follower Wiglaf a gold collar, byrnie, and gilded helmet. The passing of the helmet, from warrior to warrior and then to the ground, would have been symbolic of the larger ceremony of the passing of titles and power, and the final elegy for the man buried in the mound.\n\nThe helmet easily outstrips all other known examples in terms of richness. It is uniquely from a presumed royal burial, at a time when the monarchy was defined by the helmet and the sword. Helmets, perhaps because they were worn by rulers so frequently, may have come to be identified as crowns. Though many intermediate stages in the typological and functional evolution are yet unknown, the earliest European crowns that survive, such as the turn-of-the-millennium crown of Saint Stephen and of Constance of Aragon, share the same basic construction of many helmets, including the Coppergate example, contemporaneous with the one from Sutton Hoo: a brow band, a nose-to-nape band, and lateral bands. A divine right to rule, or at least a connection between gods and leader—also seen on earlier Roman helmets, which sometimes represented Roman gods—may also have been implied by the alteration to the sinister eyebrow on the Sutton Hoo helmet; the one-eyed appearance could only have been visible in low light, such as when its wearer was in a hall, the seat of the king's power.\n\nUnique in many respects, the Sutton Hoo helmet is nevertheless inextricably linked to its Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian contexts. It is one of only six known Anglo-Saxon helmets, along with those found at Benty Grange, Coppergate, Wollaston, Shorwell and Staffordshire, yet is closer in character to those from Vendel and Valsgärde. At the same time, the helmet shares \"consistent and intimate\" parallels with those characterised in the Anglo-Saxon epic \"Beowulf\", and, like the Sutton Hoo ship-burial as a whole, has had a profound impact on modern understandings of the poem.\n\nWithin the corpus of sixth and seventh century helmets, the Sutton Hoo helmet is broadly classified as a \"crested helmet,\" distinct from the continental spangenhelm and lamellenhelm. 50 helmets are so classified, although barely more than a dozen can be reconstructed and a few are so degraded that they are not indisputably from helmets. Excepting an outlier fragment found in Kiev; all crested helmets originate from England or Scandinavia.\n\nOf the crested helmets the Sutton Hoo helmet belongs to the Vendel and Valsgärde class, which themselves derive from the Roman infantry and cavalry helmets of the fourth and fifth century Constantinian workshops. Helmets were found in graves 1, 12 and 14 at Vendel (in addition to partial helmets in graves 10 and 11), and in graves 5, 6, 7 and 8 at Valsgärde. The Sutton Hoo example shares similarities in design, yet \"is richer and of higher quality\" than its Scandinavian analogues; its differences may reflect its manufacture for someone of higher social status, or its closer temporal proximity to the antecedent Roman helmets.\n\nAlthough the Staffordshire helmet, currently undergoing research and reconstruction, may prove to be more closely related, the four other known Anglo-Saxon helmets share only minor details in decoration and few similarities in construction with the example from Sutton Hoo. In construction its cheek guards and crest link it to its Anglo-Saxon contemporaries, yet it remains the only helmet to have a face mask, fixed neck guard, or cap raised from a single piece of metal. Decoratively it is linked by its elaborate eyebrows, boar motifs, and wire inlays, but is unparalleled in its extensive ornamentation and \"pressblech\" patterns. The similarities likely reflect \"a set of traditional decorative motifs which are more or less stable over a long period of time\"; the differences may simply highlight the disparity between royal and patrician helmets, or may indicate that the Sutton Hoo helmet was more a product of its Roman progenitors than its Anglo-Saxon counterparts.\n\nThe primary structural similarity between the Sutton Hoo and other Anglo-Saxon helmets lies in the presence of cheek guards, a feature shared by the Coppergate, Wollaston and Staffordshire helmets, yet generally missing from their Scandinavian counterparts. The construction of the Sutton Hoo helmet is otherwise largely distinguished from all other Anglo-Saxon examples. Its cap is unique in having been raised from a single piece of iron. The caps of the other helmets were each composed of at least eight pieces. On the iron Coppergate, Shorwell and Wollaston helmets, a brow band was joined by a nose-to-nape band, two lateral bands, and four infill plates, while the Benty Grange helmet was constructed from both iron and horn. A brow band was joined both by nose-to-nape and ear-to-ear bands and by four strips subdividing the resultant quadrants into eighths. Eight pieces of horn infilled the eight open spaces, with the eight joins each covered by an additional strip of horn. The Sutton Hoo helmet is also the only known Anglo-Saxon helmet to have either a face mark or a fixed neck guard; the Coppergate and Benty Grange helmets, the only others to have any surviving form of neck protection, used camail and horn, respectively, and together with the Wollaston helmet protected the face by use of nose-to-nape bands elongated to form nasals.\n\nThe decorative similarities between the Sutton Hoo helmet and its Anglo-Saxon contemporaries are peripheral, if not substantial. The helmets from Wollaston and Shorwell were designed for use rather than display; the latter was almost entirely utilitarian, while the former, \"a sparsely decorated 'fighting helmet,'\" contained only a boar crest and sets of incised lines along its bands as decoration. Its boar crest finds parallel with that atop the Benty Grange helmet, the eyes on which are made of garnets \"set in gold sockets edged with filigree wire . . . and having hollow gold shanks . . . which were sunk into a hole\" in the head. Though superficially similar to the garnets and wire inlays on the Sutton Hoo helmet, the techniques employed to combine garnet, gold and filigree work are of a higher complexity more indicative of Germanic work. A helmet sharing more distinct similarities with the Sutton Hoo example is the one from Coppergate. It features a crest and eyebrows, both hatched in a manner that may reflect \"reminiscences or imitations of actual wire inlays\" akin to those on the Sutton Hoo helmet. The eyebrows and crests on both helmets further terminate in animal heads, though in a less intricate manner on the Coppergate helmet, where they take a more two-dimensional form. These similarities are likely indicative of \"a set of traditional decorative motifs which are more or less stable over a long period of rime,\" rather than of a significant relationship between the two helmets. Compared with the \"almost austere brass against iron of the Coppergate helmet,\" the Sutton Hoo helmet, covered in tinned \"pressblech\" designs and further adorned with garnets, gilding, and inlaid silver wires, radiates \"a rich polychromatic effect.\" Its appearance is substantially more similar to the Staffordshire helmet, which, while still undergoing conservation, has \"a pair of cheek pieces cast with intricate gilded interlaced designs along with a possible gold crest and associated terminals.\" Like the Sutton Hoo helmet it was covered in \"pressblech\" foils, including a horseman and warrior motif so similar to design 3 as to have been initially taken for the same design.\n\nSignificant differences in the construction of the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets belie significant similarities in their designs. The Scandinavian helmets that are capable of restoration were constructed more simply than the Sutton Hoo helmet. None has a face mask, solid neck guard, or cap made from one piece of metal, and only two have distinct cheek guards. The neck guards \"seem without exception to have [been] either iron strips or protective mail curtains.\" The helmets from Ultuna, Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 all used iron strips as neck protection; five strips hung from the rear of the Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 brow bands, and though only two strips survive from the Ultuna helmet, others would have hung alongside them. Camail was used on the remaining helmets, from Valsgärde 6, 7 and 8, and from Vendel 1 and 12. Fragmentary remains from Vendel 10 and 11, and from Solberga, likewise suggest camail. In terms of cheek protection, only two helmets had something other than continuations of the camail or iron strips used to protect the neck. The Vendel 14 helmet had cheek guards, but of \"a differing version well forward on the face\" of those on the Sutton Hoo helmet. Though \"difficult to reconstruct,\" fragments from the Broa helmet suggest a configuration similar to those on the Vendel 14 helmet. Finally, the widely varying caps on each Scandinavian helmet all share one feature: None is similar to the cap on the Sutton Hoo helmet. The basic form of the helmets from Vendel, Valsgärde, Ultuna and Broa all started with a brow band and nose-to-nape band. The Ultuna helmet had its sides filled in with latticed iron strips, while each side on the Valsgärde 8 helmet was filled in with six parallel strips running from the brow band to the nose-to-nape brand. The remaining four helmets—excepting those from Vendel 1 and 10, and Broa, which are too fragmentary to determine their exact construction—all employed two lateral bands and sectional infills. The Vendel 14 helmet had eight infill plates, one rectangular and one triangular per quadrant; that from Valsgärde 7 helmet used four infill plates, one for each quadrant; the one from Valsgärde 6 also used identical infills for each quadrant, but with \"elaborate\" Y-shaped iron strips creating a latticed effect; and the Valsgärde 5 example filled in the back two quadrants with latticed iron strips, and the front two quadrants each with a rectangular section of lattice work and a triangular plate.\n\nThe decorative and iconographic similarities between the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets are remarkable; they are so pronounced as to have helped in the reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet's own imagery, and to have fostered the idea that the helmet was made in Sweden, not Anglo-Saxon England. Its ornate crest and eyebrows are paralleled by the Scandinavian designs, some of which replicate or imitate its silver wire inlays; garnets adorn the helmets from Sutton Hoo and Valsgärde 7; and the \"pressblech\" designs covering the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets are both ubiquitous and iconographically intertwined. Although the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian helmets almost universally have crests, hence their general classification as \"crested helmets,\" the wire inlays in the Sutton Hoo crest find their closest parallel in the \"Veldel-type helmet-crests in which such wire-inlay patterns are imitated in casting or engraving.\" Thus the crests from the Vendel 1 and 12 helmets both have chevrons mimicking the Sutton Hoo inlays, as does the Ultuna helmet and all those from Valsgärde—as well as fragments from Vendel 11 and from central Sweden. The eyebrows of Scandinavian helmets are yet more closely linked, for those on the Broa helmet are also inlaid with silver wires, while the Lokrume helmet fragment is either inlaid or overlaid with silver. Even those eyebrows without silver tend to be ornate. The Valsgärde 8, Vendel 1 and Vendel 10 eyebrows have chevrons following the same pattern as their crests, and though it lacks such an elaborate crest, the Vendel 14 helmet likewise has sets of parallel lines engraved longitudinally into the eyebrows; the lone eyebrow found at Hellvi is similarly decorated. Those that lack chevrons—singular finds from Uppåkra and Gevninge in addition to the helmets from Valsgärde 5, 6, and 7—are still highly decorated, with the garnet-encrusted Valsgärde 7 eyebrows being the only known parallel to those from Sutton Hoo.\n\nIn all these decorative respects, two Scandinavian helmets, from Valsgärde 7 and Gamla Uppsala, are uniquely similar to the Sutton Hoo example. The Valsgärde 7 crest has a \"cast chevron ornament\"; the helmet \"is 'jeweled', like the Sutton Hoo helmet, but showing a greater use of garnets\"; and it contains figural and interlace \"pressblech\" patterns, including versions of the two figural designs used on the Sutton Hoo helmet. Unlike on the Sutton Hoo helmet, the Valsgärde 7 rider and fallen warrior design was made with two dies, so that those on both dexter and sinister sides are seen moving towards the front, and they contain some \"differing and additional elements.\" The Valsgärde 7 version of the dancing warriors design, however, contains \"only [one] major iconographic difference,\" the absence of two crossed spears behind the two men. The scenes are so similar that it was only with the Valsgärde 7 design in hand that the Sutton Hoo design could be reconstructed. The Gamla Uppsala version of this scene is even more similar. It was at first thought to have been struck from the same die, and required precise measurement of the original fragments to prove otherwise. Though the angles of the forearms and between the spears are slightly different, the Gamla Uppsala fragment nonetheless provides \"the closest possible parallel\" to the Sutton Hoo design. Taken as a whole, the Valsgärde 7 helmet serves \"better than any of the other helmets of its type to make explicit the East Scandinavian context of the Sutton Hoo helmet.\" Its differences, perhaps, are explained by the fact that it was in the grave of a \"yeoman-farmer,\" not royalty. \"Royal graves strictly contemporary with [it] have not yet been excavated in Sweden, but no doubt the helmets and shields such graves contained would be nearer in quality to the examples from Sutton Hoo.\" It is for this reason that the Gamla Uppsala fragment is particularly interesting; coming from a Swedish royal cremation and with \"the dies seemingly cut by the same hand,\" the helmet \"may have been very similar to the Sutton Hoo helmet.\"\n\nWhatever its Anglo-Saxon or Scandinavian origins, the Sutton Hoo helmet is descended from the Roman helmets of the fourth and fifth century Constantinian workshops. Its construction—featuring a distinctive crest, solid cap and neck and cheek guards, face mask, and leather lining—bears clear similarities to these earlier helmets. Numerous examples have a crest similar to that on the Sutton Hoo helmet, such as those from Deurne, Concești, Augsburg-Pfersee, and Augst, and the Berkasovo 1 and 2 and Intercisa 2 and 4 helmets. Meanwhile, the one-piece cap underneath, unique in this respect among the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian helmets, represents the end of a Greek and Roman technique. Primarily used in first and second century helmets of the early Roman Empire before being replaced by helmets with a bipartite construction—hence the role of the crest in holding the two halves together—the practice is thought to have finally been forgotten around 500 AD. The solid iron cheek guards of the Sutton Hoo helmet, likewise, derive from the Constantinian style, which was also marked by cutouts towards the back. The current reconstruction partly assumes the Roman influence of the cheek guards; Roman practice reinforced the belief that leather hinges were employed, while the sinister and dexter cheek guards were swapped after an expert on arms and armour suggested that the cutouts should be at the back. The neck guard similarly assumes leather hinges, and with its solid iron construction—like the one-piece cap, unique among Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian helmets—is even more closely aligned with the Roman examples, if longer than was typical. The Witcham Gravel helmet from the first century AD has such a broad and deep neck guard, and solid projecting guards are found on the Deurne and Berkasovo 2 helmets. Another feature of the Sutton Hoo helmet unparalleled by its contemporaries—its face mask—is matched by Roman examples. Among others the Ribchester helmet from the turn of the first century AD, and the Emesa helmet from the early first century AD, each include an anthropomorphic face mask; the latter is more similar to the Sutton Hoo helmet, being affixed to the cap by a single hinge rather than entirely surrounding the face. Finally, the suggestion of a leather lining in the Sutton Hoo helmet, largely unsupported by positive evidence other than the odd texture of the interior of the helmet, gained further traction by the prevalence of similar linings in late Roman helmets.\n\nSeveral of the decorative aspects of the Sutton Hoo helmet, particularly its white appearance, inlaid garnets, and prominent rivets, also derive from Roman practice. Its tinned surface compares with the Berkasovo 1 and 2 helmets and those from Concești, Augsburg-Pfersee, and Deurne. The Berkasovo 1 and Budapest helmets are further adorned with precious or semi-precious stones, a possible origin for the garnets on the Sutton Hoo and Valsgärde 7 helmets. Finally, the prominent rivets seen on some of the crested helmets, such as those from Valsgärde 8 and Sutton Hoo, may have been inspired by the similar decorative effect achieved by the rivets on Roman helmets like the Berkasovo 2 and Duerne examples.\n\nUnderstandings of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial and \"Beowulf\" have been intertwined ever since the 1939 discovery of the former. \"By the late 1950s, \"Beowulf\" and Sutton Hoo were so inseparable that, in study after study, the appearance of one inevitably and automatically evoked the other. If \"Beowulf\" came on stage first, Sutton Hoo was swiftly brought in to illustrate how closely seventh-century reality resembled what the poet depicted; if Sutton Hoo performed first, \"Beowulf\" followed close behind to give voice to the former's dumb evidence.\" Although \"each monument sheds light on the other,\" the connection between the two \"has almost certainly been made too specific.\" Yet \"[h]elmets are described in greater detail than any other item of war-equipment in the poem,\" and some specific connections can be drawn. The boar imagery, crest and visor all find parallels in \"Beowulf\", as does the helmet's gleaming white and jeweled appearance. Though the Sutton Hoo helmet cannot be said to fully mirror any one helmet in \"Beowulf\", the many isolated similarities help ensure that \"despite the limited archaeological evidence no feature of the poetic descriptions is inexplicable and without archaeological parallel.\"\nHelmets with boar motifs are mentioned five times in \"Beowulf\", and fall into two categories: those with freestanding boars and those without. As Beowulf and his fourteen men disembark their ship and are led to see King Hrothgar, they leave the boat anchored in the water:\n\nSuch boar-shapes may have been like those on the Sutton Hoo helmet, terminating at the ends of the eyebrows and looking out over the cheek guards. Beowulf himself dons a helmet \"set around with boar images\" (') before his fight with Grendel's mother; further described as \"the white helmet . . . enhanced by treasure\" ('), a similar description could have been applied to the tinned Sutton Hoo example. (The two helmets would not have been identical, however; Beowulf's was further described as \"encircled in lordly links\"—\"\"—a possible reference to the type of chain mail on the Valsgärde 6 and 8 helmets that provided neck and face protection.) The other style of boar adornment, mentioned three times in the poem, appears to refer to helmets with a freestanding boar atop the crest. When Hrothgar laments the death of his close friend Æschere, he recalls how Æschere was \"my right hand man when the ranks clashed and our boar-crests had to take a battering in the line of action.\" These crests were probably more similar to those on the Benty Grange and Wollaston helmets, a detached boar found in Guilden Morden, and those seen in contemporary imagery on the Vendel 1 and Valsgärde 7 helmets and on the Torslunda plates.\nAlongside the boar imagery on the eyebrows, the silver inlays of the crest on the Sutton Hoo helmet find linguistic support in \"Beowulf\". The helmet presented to Beowulf as a \"victory gift\" following his defeat of Grendel is described with identical features:\n\nThis portion of the poem was thought \"probably corrupt\" until the helmet was discovered, with the suggestion that \"the scribe himself does not appear to have understood it\"; the meaning of \"the notorious ',\" in particular, was only guessed at. The term is generally used in Old English to refer to a ridge of land, not the crest of a helmet; metaphorically termed ' in the poem, the crest is furthermore ', literally \"bound with wires.\" It therefore parallels the silver inlays along the crest of the Sutton Hoo helmet. Such a crest would, as described in \"Beowulf\", provide protection from a falling sword. \"A quick turn of the head as the blow fell would enable the wearer to take it across the 'comb' and avoid its falling parallel with the comb and splitting the cap.\" The discovery has led many Old English dictionaries to define ' within the \"immediate context\" of \"Beowulf\", including as a \"ridge or comb inlaid with wires running on top of helmet from front to back,\" although doing so \"iron[s] out the figurative language\" intended in the poem. The specific meaning of the term as used within the poem is nevertheless explicated by the Sutton Hoo helmet, in turn \"illustrat[ing] the intimacy of the relationship between the archaeological material in the Sutton Hoo grave and the \"Beowulf\" poem.\"\n\nA final parallel between the Sutton Hoo helmet and those in \"Beowulf\" is the presence of face masks, a feature which makes the former unique among its Anglo-Saxon and East Scandinavian counterparts. The uniqueness may reflect that, as part of a royal burial, the helmet is \"richer and of higher quality than any other helmet yet found.\" In \"Beowulf\", \"a poem about kings and nobles, in which the common people hardly appear,\" compounds such as \"battle-mask\" ('), \"war-mask\" ('), \"mask-helm\" ('), and \"war-head\" (') indicate the use of visored helmets. The term \"war-head\" is particularly apt for the anthropomorphic Sutton Hoo helmet. \"[T]he word does indeed describe a helmet realistically. \"\": complete head-covering, forehead, eyebrows, eye-holes, cheeks, nose, mouth, chin, even a moustache!\"\n\nThe Sutton Hoo helmet was discovered over three days in July and August 1939, with only three weeks remaining in the excavation of the ship-burial. It was found in more than 500 pieces, which would prove to account for less than half of the original surface area. The discovery was recorded in the diary of C. W. Phillips as follows:\n\nAlthough the helmet is now considered to be one of the most important artefacts ever found on British soil, its shattered state caused it to go at first unnoticed. No photographs were taken of the fragments \"in situ\", nor were their relative positions recorded, as the importance of the discovery had not yet been realised. The only contemporary record of the helmet's location was a circle on the excavation diagram marked \"nucleus of helmet remains.\" When reconstruction of the helmet commenced years later, it would thus become \"a jigsaw puzzle without any sort of picture on the lid of the box,\" not to mention a jigsaw puzzle missing half its pieces.\n\nOverlooked at first, the helmet quickly gained notice. Even before all the fragments had been excavated, the \"Daily Mail\" spoke of \"a gold helmet encrusted with precious stones.\" A few days later it would more accurately describe the helmet as having \"elaborate interlaced ornaments in silver and gold leaf.\" Despite scant time to examine the fragments, they were termed \"elaborate\" and \"magnificent\"; \"crushed and rotted\" and \"sadly broken\" such that it \"may never make such an imposing exhibit as it ought to do,\" it was nonetheless thought the helmet \"may be one of the most exciting finds.\" The stag found in the burial—later placed atop the sceptre—was even thought at first to adorn the crest of the helmet, in parallel to the boar-crested Benty Grange helmet. This theory would gain no traction, however, and the helmet would have to wait out World War II before reconstruction could begin.\n\nExcavations at Sutton Hoo came to an end on 24 August 1939, and all items were shipped out the following day. Nine days later, Britain declared war on Germany. The intervening time allowed \"first-aid treatment of fragile objects and perishables,\" and for \"the finds to be deposited in security.\" Throughout World War II the Sutton Hoo artefacts, along with other treasures from the British Museum such as the Elgin Marbles, were stored in Aldwych tube station. Only at the end of 1944 were preparations made to unpack, conserve and restore the finds from Sutton Hoo.\n\nThe helmet was first reconstructed by Herbert Maryon from 1945 to 1946. A retired professor of sculpture and an authority on early metalwork, Maryon was specially employed as a Technical Attaché at the British Museum on 11 November 1944. His job was to restore and conserve the finds from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, including \"the real headaches – notably the crushed shield, helmet and drinking horns.\" Maryon's work on the Sutton Hoo objects continued until 1950, of which six continuous months were was spent reconstructing the helmet. Stalled for years by World War II and still in the fragmentary state in which it had entered the war, by the time it reached Maryon's workbench the \"task of restoration was thus reduced to a jigsaw puzzle without any sort of picture on the lid of the box,\" and, \"as it proved, a great many of the pieces missing.\"\n\nEfforts on the first reconstruction began with a \"process of familiarisation\" with the various fragments; each piece was traced and detailed on a \"piece of stiff card\", until after \"a long while\" reconstruction could commence. For this, Maryon sculpted \"a head of normal size\" from plaster, then \"padded the head out above the brows to allow for the thickness of the lining which a metal helmet would naturally require.\" The fragments of the skull cap were then initially stuck to the head with Plasticine, or, if thicker, placed into spaces cut into the head. Finally, \"strong white plaster\" was used to permanently affix the fragments, and, mixed with brown umber, fill in the gaps between pieces. Meanwhile, the fragments of the cheek guards, neck guard, and visor were placed onto shaped, plaster-covered wire mesh, then affixed with more plaster and joined to the cap.\n\nThough visibly different from the current reconstruction, \"[m]uch of Maryon's work is valid. The general character of the helmet was made plain.\" The 1946 reconstruction identified the designs recognised today, and similarly arranged them in a panelled configuration. Both reconstructions composed the visor and neck guards with the same designs: the visor with the smaller interlace (design 5), the neck guard with a top row of the larger interlace (design 4) above two rows of the smaller interlace. The layout of the cheek guards is also similar in both reconstructions; the main differences are the added length provided by a third row in the second reconstruction, the replacement of a design 4 panel with the dancing warriors (design 1) in the middle row, and the switching of sides.\n\nThe first reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was met with worldwide acclaim and was both academically and culturally influential. It stayed on display for more than 20 years, during which time it became an iconic object of the Middle Ages. In 1951 the helmet was displayed at the Festival of Britain, where an exhibit on Sutton Hoo was curated by Rupert Bruce-Mitford. That same year \"Life\" dispatched a 25-year-old Larry Burrows to the British Museum, resulting in a full-page photograph of the helmet alongside a photograph of Maryon; five years later, on the strength of his restorations, Maryon was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Images of the helmet made their way into television programmes, books, and newspapers, even as the second reconstruction was worked on. Though the lasting impact of the first reconstruction is as a first, reversible, attempt from which problems could be identified and solutions could be found, for two decades Maryon's reconstruction was an icon in its own right.\n\nWith the helmet on public display and as greater knowledge of contemporary helmets became available, the first reconstruction \"was soon criticised, though not in print, by Swedish scholars and others.\" An underlying issue was the decision to arrange the fragments around the mould of an average man's head, possibly inadvertently predetermining the reconstruction's size. Particular criticisms also noted its exposed areas, and a neck guard that was fixed rather than movable. Though envisioned as similar to a \"crash helmet of a motor cyclist\" with padding of about between head and helmet, its size allowed for little such cushioning; one with a larger head would have had difficulty just getting it on. The missing portion at the front of each cheek piece left the jaw exposed, there was a hole between eyebrows and nose, and the \"eye holes were so large\" as to \"allow a sword to pass through.\" Meanwhile, as noted early on by Sune Lindqvist, the \"angle of the face mask looked strange, not least because it rendered the wearer's nose vulnerable in the event of a blow to the face.\"\n\nA final issue raised by Maryon's construction was the use of plaster to elongate the crest by approximately . The crest had largely survived its millennium of interment, perhaps given durability by the inlaid silver wires. The need to replace missing portions was thus questioned; it was thought that either Maryon had reconstructed the crest \"to an undue length\", or that original portions had been overlooked during the 1939 excavation. When the ship-burial was re-excavated in the 1960s, one of the objectives was thus to search for more fragments, the absence of which could be treated as evidence that the crest had originally been shorter.\n\nNumerous questions were left unanswered by the 1939 excavation at Sutton Hoo, and in 1965 a second excavation began. Among other objectives were to survey the burial mound and its surrounding environment, to relocate the ship impression (from which a plaster cast was ultimately taken) and excavate underneath, and to search the strata from the 1939 dumps for any fragments that may have been originally missed. The first excavation had been effectively \"rescue dig\" under the threat of impending war, creating the danger that fragments of objects might have been inadvertently discarded; a gold mount from the burial was already known to have nearly met that fate. Additional fragments of the helmet could hopefully shed light on the unidentified third figural design, or buttress Maryon's belief that of the crest were missing. To this end, the excavation sought \"both positive and negative evidence.\" New crest fragments could go where Maryon had placed plaster, while their absence could be used to suggest that the crest on the first reconstruction was too long.\n\nFour new helmet fragments were discovered during re-excavation. The three 1939 dumps were located during the 1967 season, and \"almost at once\" yielded \"fragments of helmet and of the large hanging bowl ... as well as fragments of shield ornaments and a tine from the stag.\" The finds were so plentiful that a single three foot by one foot section of the first dump contained sixty cauldron fragments. The four pieces of the helmet came from the second dump, which contained only items from the ship's burial chamber. They included a hinge piece from the dexter cheek guard, a \"surface flake\" from the crest, a small piece of iron with fluted lines, and a small piece of iron edging showing part of the larger interlace design.\n\nThe most important helmet finds from the re-excavation at Sutton Hoo were the piece from cheek guard, and the lack of any substantial crest piece. The fragment of the cheek guard joined another found in 1939, together completing \"a hinge plate for one of the moving parts of the helmet, which could not be done previously.\" Meanwhile, although a \"surface flake\" from the crest was discovered, its placement did not affect the overall length of the crest. The lack of significant crest finds instead \"reinforce[d] scepticism of the long plaster insertions in the original reconstruction.\"\n\nThe current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was completed in 1971, following eighteen months of work by Nigel Williams. Williams had joined the British Museum in his teens after studying at the same Central School of Arts and Crafts as Maryon, yet in contrast to Maryon, who completed the first restoration in his 70s and \"with the use of only one eye,\" Williams reconstructed the helmet while in his mid-20s.\n\nIn 1968, with problems evident in the first reconstruction that were left unresolved by the re-excavations at Sutton Hoo, the decision was made to reexamine the evidence. \"After several months' consideration\" it was decided to disassemble the helmet and construct it anew. The cheek guards, face mask and neck guard were first removed from the helmet and x-rayed, revealing the wire mesh covered in plaster and overlaid by fragments. The wire was then \"rolled back like a carpet\", and a saw used to separate each fragment. The remaining plaster was chipped away with a scalpel and needles. The final piece of the helmet, the skull cap, was next cut in half by pushing off the crest with \"long pins\" inserted through the bottom of the plaster head and then slicing through the middle of the head. The \"central core of plaster\" was then removed, and the remaining \"thin skin of plaster and iron\" separated into individual fragments \"in the same way as the ear flaps, neck guard and face mask.\" This process of separation took four months and left the helmet in more than 500 fragments. The result was \"terrifying\" to Williams. \"One of only two known Anglo-Saxon helmets, an object illustrated in almost every book on the early medieval period, lay in pieces.\"\n\nAfter four months of disassembly, work began on a new construction of the helmet. This work was advanced largely by the discovery of new joins, marked by several breakthroughs in understanding. \"Almost all\" of the new joins were found by looking at the backs of the fragments, which retained \"a unique blackened, rippled and bubbly nature,\" \"wrinkled like screwed up paper and very black in colour.\" The distinctive nature is thought to result from a \"disintegrated leather lining permeated with iron oxide\"—indeed, this is the evidence substantiating the leather lining in the Royal Armouries replica—and allowed for the fragments' wrinkles to be matched under a microscope. In this manner the skull cap was built out from the crest, aided by the discovery that only the two fluted strips bordering the crest were gilded; the six fragments with gilded moulding were consequently found to attach to the crest. The cheek guards, meanwhile, were shaped and substantially lengthened by joining three fragments from the sinister side of the first reconstruction with two fragments from the dexter side. The exposed areas by the jaw left by the first reconstruction were only eliminated near the end of the second, when an expert on arms and armour advised that the cheek guards should simply switch sides.\n\nWhen a \"reasonable picture of the original helmet\" was in view, more than nine months of work into the second reconstruction, the repositioned fragments were placed against a \"featureless plaster dome.\" This dome was itself built outwards with \"oil-free plasticine\" to match the original dimensions of the helmet. The fragments were held in place with \"long pins\" until a mixture of jute and adhesive was molded to the shape of the missing areas, and adhered to the fragments. The edges of the fragments were then coated with water-resistant resin, and plaster was spread atop the jute to level and smooth the helmet's surface. The plaster was painted light brown to resemble the colour of the fragments while allowing the fragments themselves to stand out; lines were then drawn to indicate the edges of the panels. The result was a hollow helmet in which the backs of the fragments remain visible. On 2 November 1971, after eighteen months of time and a full year of work by Williams, the second and current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was put on display.\n\nThe 1971 reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was widely celebrated, and in the five decades since it has come to symbolise the Middle Ages, archaeology, and England. It is depicted on the covers of novels, textbooks, and scholarly publications, such as \"The Winter King\" by Bernard Cornwell and \"The Anglo-Saxons\" by James Campbell, and has influenced artists, filmmakers and designers. At the same time, the helmet has become the face of a time once known as the Dark Ages, but now recognised for its sophistication—in part because of the finds from Sutton Hoo—and referred to as the Middle Ages. It gives truth to a period of time known from depictions of warriors and mead halls in \"Beowulf\", once thought fanciful, and personifies the Anglo-Saxons in post-Roman Britain. Considered \"the most iconic object\" from an archaeological find hailed as the \"British Tutankhamen,\" in 2006 it was voted one of the 100 cultural icons of England alongside the Queen's head stamp, the double-decker bus, and the cup of tea.\n\nAlthough \"universally acclaimed,\" the current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet left \"a number of minor problems unsolved\" and contains several slight inaccuracies. These are primarily confined to the neck guard, where \"very little indeed of the original substance . . . survives that can be positioned with any certainty.\" Two blocks of fragments on the bottom edge, and four blocks of fragments in the middle, are only speculatively placed, leaving some uncertainty about their correct locations. The resulting uncertainties relate to the placement of the individual fragments within the larger space, rather than to a problem with the proposed shape of the neck guard.\n\nAs currently reconstructed, the Sutton Hoo neck guard has three principal problems. Several fragments of design 5 are placed too high on the neck guard, which \"shows more space below the lengths of transverse fluted strips than above them. The space left below is greater than the length of the die, while the space above is less than the length of the die.\" Corrected on the Royal Armouries replica, the configuration should allow for two full impressions of design 5, of equal length, joined vertically at their ends. Furthermore, the lack of fragments from the neck guard leaves open the question of how many vertical strips of design 5 were used. Although seven strips were suggested in the reconstruction, \"[t]here is no evidence to indicate that there were seven vertical ornamental strips on the lower portion of the neck-guard, and the suggestion . . . that the number should be cut to five is equally possible.\" Even if seven is the accurate number, the current reconstruction shows an \"implausible inward tilt\" by the two strips flanking the central one; straightening the strips \"would have the effect of allowing the ornamental strips to fan out naturally, leaving evenly-expanding wedges of plain surface between them.\" Finally, the neck guard hangs lower on the current reconstruction than it would have when made, for the top of the neck guard originally fitted inside the cap. This leaves the abutting edges of the dexter cheek and neck guards at different levels, and was corrected on the Royal Armouries replica.\n\nIn 1973 the Royal Armouries collaborated with the British Museum to create a replica of the newly restored Sutton Hoo helmet. The museum provided a general blueprint of the design along with electrotypes of the decorative elements—nose and mouth piece, eyebrows, dragon heads, and \"pressblech\" foils—leaving the Master of the Armouries A. R. Duffy, along with his assistant H. Russell Robinson and senior conservation officer armourers E. H. Smith and A. Davis to complete the task. A number of differences in construction were observed, such as a solid crest, lead solder used to back the decorative effects, and the technique employed to inlay the silver, although the helmet hewed closely to the original design. The differences led to the replica's weight of , or heavier than the estimated weight of the original. The finished replica was unveiled before an address at the \"Sachsensymposion\" in September 1973 with theatrical flair: the lights were dimmed; down the aisle came Nigel Williams holding a replica of the Sutton Hoo whetstone; and behind him followed Rupert Bruce-Mitford, wearing a carriage rug and with hands hieratically crossed, wearing the Royal Armouries helmet and reciting the opening lines of \"Beowulf\".\n\nThe Royal Armouries replica clarified a number of details of the original helmet, and provided an example of what it looked like when new. It could also be worn and subjected to experimentation in a way the original could not. In particular the reproduction showed that the neck guard would have originally been set inside the cap, allowing it to move with more freedom and ride up, and thereby demonstrated an inaccuracy in the 1971 reconstruction, where the neck guard and the dexter cheek guard are misaligned. The replica also corrected a second error in the reconstruction of the neck guard by affording an equal length to both the lower and upper instances of design 5, although it probably introduced an error by placing a visible billeted border on all four sides of each design 5 impression. That the replica could be worn also evinced several attributes of the original. It demonstrated the ranges of motion and vision that a wearer would have, and that with adequate padding in addition to the leather lining, people with heads of different sizes could comfortably wear the helmet. It also showed that the helmet, while stifling, could realistically be worn in battle, and that it would bestow upon its wearer a commanding and sonorous voice. Finally, and most strikingly, the Royal Armouries replica simply showed how the Sutton Hoo helmet originally appeared. It showed the helmet as a shining white object rather than a rusted brown relic, and in doing so illustrated the lines in \"Beowulf\" referring to \"the white helmet . . . enhanced by treasure\" (\"ac se hwita helm . . . since geweorðad\").\n\nThe replica is displayed in the British Museum alongside the original helmet in Room 41. It has also been exhibited worldwide, including stops in the United States, Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon\n\nBenty Grange\n\nCoppergate\n\nShorwell\n\nStaffordshire\n\nWollaston\n\nOther\n\nScandinavian\n\nGamla Uppsala\n\nGotland\n\nValsgärde\n\nVendel\n\nOther\n\nRoman\n\n\nFirst reconstruction\n\nSecond reconstruction\n\nRoyal Armouries replica\n"}

It tells the cross-cut tale of two men, Abu Jandal and Salim Ahmed Hamdan, whose meeting launched them on juxtaposed paths with al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, the September 11 attacks, US military tribunals and the U.S. Supreme Court. The film is the second of a trilogy, with the first being \"My Country, My Country\" (2006), documenting the lives of Iraqi citizens during the U.S. occupation of Iraq. The third, \"Citizenfour\" (2014), focuses on the NSA's domestic surveillance programs. \"The Oath\" is distributed both theatrically and non-theatrically in the US by New York-based Zeitgeist Films.\n\nThe film revolves around Abu Jandal, a taxi driver in San'a, Yemen who had worked as a bodyguard to Osama bin Laden for four years, and Salim Ahmed Hamdan. The latter worked for bin Laden as his driver in Afghanistan, and was captured in 2001 during the US invasion. He was detained as an enemy combatant and transported in 2002 to Guantanamo Bay. Hamdan was the first defendant to be tried in the U.S. military tribunals established by the United States Department of Defense.\n\nThe men became brothers-in-law after marrying sisters. The lives of the two men are explored and challenge viewers' ideas about jihad, loyalty and al-Qaeda. The filmmaker, Laura Poitras, inter-cuts Hamdan's trial (his military lawyer challenges the tribunals as unconstitutional and takes Hamdan's case to the US Supreme Court) with Jandal's contradictory conversations with his son and Muslim pupils, and during media interviews.\n\nThe Supreme Court challenge was decided in Hamdan's favor and Congress passed a new law, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to respond to the court's objections. Under that, Hamdan was convicted on one charge but acquitted on another. His sentence gave him credit for time detained and in November 2008, he was transferred to Yemen with one month to serve. He was released but continued to appeal his conviction.\n\nIt was upheld in 2011 by the Court of Military Commission Review and appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On October 17, 2012, the Court vacated Hamdan's conviction. It ruled that the acts he was charged with under the MCA were not war crimes by international law at the time he committed them. This meant that his prosecution was \"ex post facto\" and unconstitutional.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the \"Excellence in Cinematography Award for U.S. Documentary\". It was also featured at the Berlin Film Festival in February 2010 and the South by Southwest film festival in March 2010.\n\nThe director Laura Poitras won the \"True Vision Award\" at the True/False Film Festival for the creation of the documentary.\nThe film had its television premiere on PBS's show P.O.V. in 2010.\n\nThe film was presented at the San Francisco International Film Festival in late April 2010 and the Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival in early October 2010.\n\n"}

Pugh came to Brisbane from London in 1855.\n\nPugh is well known in Queensland history honoured as the a journalist and public servant and as the publisher of the still frequently used Pugh's Almanac of Queensland. Yet the conspiracy of silence on all matters dealing with Aboriginal rights meant that Pugh was never credited for his editorial campaign in the \"Brisbane Courier\" for Aboriginal rights and against Queensland's infamous frontier force the Native Police Force in the years 1860 to 1861. Pugh's biographers mentions his contribution as a political journalist and as publisher of Pugh's Almanac and critical stands in regards to the kanaka trade but not one word about his crucial role in connection to the editorial campaign against the native police in 1860–61 and the Select Committee of 1861.

After leaving what is now the \"Brisbane Courier\" in 1863, Mr. Pugh was identified with various journalistic ventures, and when the Brisbane \"Telegraph\" was started in 1872, Mr. Pugh was its first editor, a position which he retained for slightly over a year. \"Pugh's Moreton Bay Almanac\" appeared in sheet form at the close of 1857, and in book size the following year.

The film features an ensemble cast led by Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom. It is loosely based on Homer's \"Iliad\" in its narration of the entire story of the decade-long Trojan War—condensed into little more than a couple of weeks, rather than just the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon in the ninth year. Achilles leads his Myrmidons along with the rest of the Greek army invading the historical city of Troy, defended by Hector's Trojan army. The end of the film (the sack of Troy) is not taken from the \"Iliad\", but rather from Homer's \"Odyssey\" as the \"Iliad\" concludes with Hector's death and funeral.\n\n\"Troy\" made more than 73% of its revenues outside the United States. Eventually, \"Troy\" made over $497 million worldwide, temporarily placing it in the #60 spot of top box office hits of all time. It was the 8th highest-grossing film of 2004.\n\nIn the late 12th century BC, a battle between the armies of King Agamemnon of Mycenae and Triopas of Thessaly is averted when the great warrior, Achilles, defeats Thessaly's champion in single combat, forcing Triopas and Thessaly to join Agamemnon's loose alliance of all the Greek kingdoms. Meanwhile, Prince Hector of Troy and his younger brother Paris negotiate a peace treaty with Menelaus, King of Sparta. However, Paris is having an affair with Menelaus' wife, Queen Helen, and smuggles her aboard their home-bound vessel. Upon learning of this, Menelaus meets with Agamemnon, his elder brother, and asks him to help take Troy. Agamemnon agrees, as conquering Troy will give him control of the Aegean Sea. Agamemnon has Odysseus, King of Ithaca, persuade Achilles to join them. Achilles, who strongly dislikes Agamemnon, eventually decides to go, after his mother Thetis tells him that though he will die, he will be forever glorified.\n\nIn Troy, King Priam is dismayed when Hector and Paris introduce Helen, but welcomes her and decides to prepare for war. The Greeks eventually invade and take the Trojan beach, thanks largely to Achilles and his Myrmidons. Achilles has the temple of Apollo sacked, and claims Briseis — a priestess and the cousin of Paris and Hector — as a prisoner. He is angered when Agamemnon spitefully takes her from him, and decides that he will not aid Agamemnon in the siege.\n\nThe Trojan and Greek armies meet outside the walls of Troy; during a parley, Paris offers to duel Menelaus personally for Helen's hand in exchange for the city being spared. Agamemnon, intending to take the city regardless of the outcome, accepts. Menelaus wounds Paris and almost kills him, but is himself killed by Hector. In the ensuing battle, Hector kills Ajax and many Greek soldiers fall to the Trojan defenses. On Odysseus' insistence, Agamemnon gives the order to fall back. He gives Briseis to the Greek soldiers for their amusement, but Achilles saves her. Later that night, Briseis sneaks into Achilles' quarters to kill him; instead, she falls for him and they become lovers. Achilles then resolves to leave Troy, much to the dismay of Patroclus, his cousin and protégé.\n\nDespite Hector's objections, Priam orders him to retake the Trojan beach and force the Greeks home; the attack unifies the Greeks and the Myrmidons enter the battle. Hector duels a man he believes to be Achilles and cuts his throat, only to discover it was actually Patroclus. Distraught, Hector euthanizes Patroclus and the armies agree to stop fighting for the day. Achilles is informed of his cousin's death and vows revenge. Wary of Achilles, Hector shows his wife Andromache a secret tunnel beneath Troy; should he die and the city fall, he instructs her to take their child and any survivors out of the city to Mount Ida.\n\nThe next day, Achilles arrives outside Troy and challenges Hector; the two duel until Hector is killed, and Achilles drags his corpse back to the Trojan beach. Priam, in disguise, sneaks into the camp and implores Achilles to return Hector's body for a proper funeral. Ashamed of his actions, Achilles agrees and allows Briseis to return to Troy with Priam, promising a twelve day truce so that Hector's funeral rites may be held in peace. He also orders his men to return home without him.\n\nAgamemnon declares that he will take Troy regardless of the cost. Concerned, Odysseus concocts a plan to infiltrate the city: he has the Greeks build a gigantic wooden horse as a peace offering and abandon the Trojan beach, hiding their ships in a nearby cove. Priam orders the horse be brought into the city. That night, Greeks hiding inside the horse emerge and open the city gates for the Greek army, commencing the Sack of Troy. While Andromache and Helen guide the Trojans to safety through the tunnel, Paris gives the Sword of Troy to Aeneas, instructing him to protect the Trojans and find them a new home. Agamemnon kills Priam and captures Briseis, who then kills Agamemnon. Achilles fights his way through the city and reunites with Briseis. Paris, seeking to avenge his brother, shoots an arrow through Achilles' heel and then several into his body. Achilles bids farewell to Briseis, and watches her flee with Paris before dying.\n\nIn the aftermath, Troy is finally taken and a funeral is held for Achilles, where Odysseus personally cremates his body.\n\nThe city of Troy was built in the Mediterranean island of Malta at Fort Ricasoli from April to June 2003. Other important scenes were shot in Mellieħa, a small town in the north of Malta, and on the small island of Comino. The outer walls of Troy were built and filmed in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Film production was disrupted for a period after Hurricane Marty affected filming areas. The role of Briseis was initially offered to Bollywood superstar Aishwarya Rai, but she refused it because she was not comfortable doing the lovemaking scenes that were included. The role eventually went to Rose Byrne.\n\nComposer Gabriel Yared originally worked on the score for \"Troy\" for over a year, having been hired by the director, Wolfgang Petersen. Tanja Carovska provided vocals on various portions of the music, as she later would on composer James Horner's version of the soundtrack. However, the reactions at test screenings which used an incomplete version of the score were negative, and in less than a day Yared was off the project without a chance to fix or change his music. James Horner composed a replacement score in about four weeks. He used Carovska's vocals again and also included traditional Eastern Mediterranean music and brass instruments. Horner also collaborated with American singer-songwriter Josh Groban and lyricist Cynthia Weil to write an original song for the film's end credits. The product of this collaboration, \"Remember\" was performed by Groban with additional vocals by Carovska.\n\nThe soundtrack for the film was released on May 11, 2004 through Reprise Records.\n\n\"Troy: Director's Cut\" was screened at the 57th Berlin International Film Festival on February 17, 2007 and received a limited release in Germany in April 2007. Warner Home Video reportedly spent more than $1 million for the director's cut, which includes \"at least 1,000 new cuts\" or almost 30 minutes extra footage (with a new running time of 196 minutes). The DVD was released on September 18, 2007 in the US. The score of the film was changed dramatically, with many of the female vocals being cut. An addition to the music is the use of Danny Elfman's theme for \"Planet of the Apes\" during the pivotal fight between Hector and Achilles in front of the Gates of Troy.\n\nVarious shots were recut and extended. For instance, the love scene between Helen and Paris was reframed to include more nudity of Diane Kruger. The love scene between Achilles and Briseis is also extended. Only one scene was removed: the scene where Helen tends to the wound of Paris is taken out. The battle scenes were also extended, showing much more of Ajax's bloody rampage on the Trojans during the initial attack by the Greek Army. Perhaps most significant was the sacking of Troy, barely present in the theatrical cut, but shown fully here, depicting the soldiers raping women and murdering babies. Characters were given more time to develop, specifically Priam and Odysseus, the latter being given a humorous introduction scene. Lastly, bookend scenes were added: the beginning being a soldier's dog finding its dead master and the end including a sequence where the few surviving Trojans escape to Mount Ida. In one of the commentary sequences, the film's writer, David Benioff, said that when it came to deciding whether to follow \"The Iliad\" or to do what was best for the film, they always decided with what was best for the film.\n\nTroy was released on DVD on January 4, 2005 The Director's cut was released on Blu-Ray & DVD on September 18, 2007 The Directors Cut is the only edition of the film available on Blu-Ray, however the theatrical cut was released on HD-DVD.\n\nWhen the film was completed, total production costs were approximately $185 million. This made \"Troy\" one of the most expensive films produced in modern cinema. It was screened out of competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\"Troy\" screenings have earned US$133,378,256 in the United States.\n\n\"Troy\" made more than 73% of its revenues outside the United States. Eventually, \"Troy\" made over US$497 million worldwide, temporarily placing it in the #60 spot of top box office hits of all time. It was the 8th highest-grossing film of 2004 and currently is in the top 150 highest-grossing films of all time.\n\n\"Troy\" was met with mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 54%, based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's consensus describes the film as \"A brawny, entertaining spectacle, but lacking emotional resonance.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 56 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". On IMDb, it has an average rating of 7.2/10.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Arabic-Hebrew-Aramaic month names themselves originate in the ancient Babylonian calendar, and are therefore akin to the names of months in the Hebrew Calendar, specifically Shevat, Nisan, Tammuz and Elul. The original Babylonian months were actual lunar months, as the Hebrew months of the same names are to this day, much like months in the Islamic calendar. Turkey has used Gregorian AD year numbering officially since 1926, though Gregorian calendar dates were in use since March 1917. The names of the months from February to September had been used in the now abandoned Rumi calendar, with the other four still retaining their old Arabic/Aramaic names. In 1945, these four received names of Turkish origin.\n\n"}

{"id": "388164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=388164", "title": "Yomp", "text": "Yomp\n\nYomp is Royal Marines slang describing a long-distance loaded march carrying full kit.\nThe origin of the word is unclear (one suggestion would interpret it as an acronym of \"Your Own Marching Pace\"). It was popularized by journalistic coverage in 1982 during the Falklands War. \n\"Yomp\" has been compared to the term \"yump\" used in rally-driving in the sense of \"to leave the ground when taking a crest at speed\", apparently a variant of \"jump\".\n\nThe most famous yomp of recent times was during the 1982 Falklands War. After disembarking from ships at San Carlos on East Falkland, on 21 May 1982, Royal Marines and members of the Parachute Regiment yomped (and tabbed) with their equipment across the islands, covering in three days carrying loads.\n\nBritish Army slang for the same concept is \"T.A.B.\", of equally unknown origin. (One suggestion would interpret it as an acronym of Tactical Advance to Battle.)\n\nUS Military slang for this concept is to \"ruck\" (from the \"rucksack\" being carried) or to \"hump\" from the phrase \"humping a pack\".\n\nThe image of \"the Yomper\" became one of the iconic images of the Falklands War.\nThe original photograph was taken by Petty Officer Peter Holdgate, Commando Forces Photographer, whilst working as part of the Commando Forces News Team. After landing with 40 Commando at San Carlos, Holdgate accompanied British forces across the Falklands War zone taking hundreds of photographs as the Royal Marines proceeded along the Moody Brook track towards Stanley.\nWhen news of the surrender of Argentine forces was received, Corporal Brennan produced a small Union bunting flag from his bergen (Proffed from SS Canberra's bunting locker). Marine Fraser first tied the flag to Corporal Brennan's radio aerial, which eventually blew off. It was then fixed with masking tape to the radio aerial of Corporal Robinson (who was the last man in the patrol). The photograph itself was entirely spontaneous and not staged. The original Union Flag was returned to Corporal Brennan in Stanley, who has it in his possession to this day.\n\nThe image was used as the inspiration of a statue that was unveiled by Margaret Thatcher on 8 July 1992 on the 10th anniversary of the conflict. It now adorns the entrance to the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea.\n\nMedia coverage of this war saw the term \"yomp\" become well known and enter general use. However, the term has since faded somewhat from general use in the decades since the end of the Falklands war.\n\n\n\n"}
