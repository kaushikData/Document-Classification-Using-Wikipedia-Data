While a young boy, Hunt witnessed the California state convention of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War held in his family's backyard in 1972.\n\nAndrew Hunt grew up around universities, as his father E. K. Hunt has taught at five universities. E. K. Hunt is an Emeritus Professor of Economics at the University of Utah.\n\nAndrew Hunt was raised in California and Utah. On May 11, 1987, Hunt (then an undergraduate) was one of eight student activists protesting South African apartheid who practiced civil disobedience at a meeting of the University of Utah's Institutional Council. The students were demanding that the university divest all of its holdings in corporations having operations in South Africa. Four of the students were arrested; all eight were charged with misdemeanors by the university. However, the students' efforts were successful as the Institutional Council voted one month later to divest.\n\nHunt received his B.A. from the University of Utah in 1990. In 1997 he received his Ph.D. also from the University of Utah. His Ph.D. advisor was History Professor Robert Goldberg. Hunt began teaching at the University of Waterloo the same year.\n\nHunt is the author of several books (see below), and is a columnist for the \"Waterloo Region Record\" where he regularly comments on politics and world affairs. Hunt has said that his research and effort for writing his first book (\"The Turning: A History of Vietnam Veterans Against the War\") was part of his own quest \"to understand the environment and the society that swept my family away and broke us apart.\" He is currently writing a book on Ronald Reagan and Cold War culture in the United States in the 1980s.\n\nHunt resides in Waterloo, Ontario.

The battle was fought at Otumba de Gómez Farías, Mexico in 1520.\n\nAround the end of March 1519, Hernán Cortés landed with a Spanish conquistador force at Potonchán on the coast of modern-day Mexico. Cortés had been commissioned by Governor Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar of Spanish-controlled Cuba to lead an expedition in the area, which was dominated by the Aztec Empire. At the last moment, though, Velázquez revoked Cortés's commission, but he decided to launch his expedition regardless.\n\nThrough a combination of raw force and political maneuvering, Cortés was able to secure the allegiance of the Totonacs and the Tlaxcaltec (subjugated enemies of the Aztec empire) among other groups during his advance on the Empire's main settlement, Tenochtitlan. In November, a Spanish force entered the city and was greeted by its ruler, Moctezuma II.\n\nInitially, the conquistadors were treated well by the Aztecs whilst they stayed in the city, until Velázquez, angered at Cortés' disobedience, sent an armed force at the command of Pánfilo Narváez against Cortés to bring him to justice and claim the lands and riches he had conquered. Cortés was forced to leave a small garrison of men in Tenochtitlan at the command of one of his lieutenants, Pedro de Alvarado, whilst he took his small force to meet Narváez in battle. After securing a quick and brilliant victory, Cortés joined Narvaez' forces to his own, and marched back to Tenochtitlán, as he had heard word that the city was up in arms against the remaining Spaniards. Upon arriving, Alvarado told Cortés' he had been convinced that the Aztecs planned to attack the Spaniards and thus struck preemptively during an Aztec ritual ceremony, which caused an outrage in Tenochtitlán. The Aztecs named a new emperor to replace Moctezuma, whom they regarded now as weak and easily influenced by the Spaniards. Cortés attempted to negotiate a peace, and as a last resort, urged Moctezuma to speak with his people to achieve a truce, but the angry Aztecs struck down Moctezuma in a hail of rocks. This was the state of affairs by the end of June 1520. Desperate to escape the city, and further convinced by an omen one of the Spaniards claimed to have received, the Spaniards resolved to leave the city that night in an event called \"La Noche Triste\" (The Night of Sorrows). During this attempt at salvation, however, Cortés' forces and entourage (consisting of civilian-grade women and men of both Spanish and Indian extraction) were severely cut down. Of the Spanish force of approximately 1300, only less than 500 men at arms escaped with their lives, along with a few hundred Tlaxcalans and civilians. Cortés then started a retreat to Tlaxcala, during which his force was harassed by Aztec skirmishers, and the Aztec leadership resolved to eliminate them as they withdrew.\n\nAfter being beleaguered on the causeway leading out of the city, the surviving Spanish forces arrived at the plain of Otumba, where they encountered a vast Aztec army. Despite their opponents' exhaustion and hunger, the Aztecs failed to capitalize on their numerical superiority by not attacking right away. \n\nAccording to conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo's account of the events, it was the Castilian Cavalry that was decisive for victory in the perilous battle. The Aztecs regarded the Spaniards as already defeated, and were looking to gain glory from capturing live Spaniards to sacrifice to their gods. The Castilian cavalry spearheaded the attack, breaking through the ranks and decimating the Aztec lines, preparing them for the assault of the Castilian rodeleros and Tlaxcalan infantry. Though this approach was successful, the sheer numbers of the Aztecs still managed to overwhelm the Castilians.\n\nThe Aztecs, meanwhile, had not encountered Castilians in battle, despite their long exposure to them during the Spaniards' time in Tenochtitlan. They were unfamiliar with the use of troops mounted on horses as shock troops and were taken aback when mounted Spanish soldiers continually charged at them. For all of their numbers, they were unprepared to endure cavalry charges.\n\nSpaniard success was also thanks to Cortés strategy, he had instructed his troops to strike primarily at the captains and leaders of their opponent. Cortés himself recognized the Aztec leader Matlatzincatl for his rich armor, headdress, and flag. He correctly assumed that defeating their leader and capturing their flag would result in the defeat of the Aztecs. He communicated his idea to his captains and led a charge for Matlatzincatl, followed by Gonzalo de Sandoval, Pedro de Alvarado, Cristóbal de Olid, Juan de Salamanca and Alonso Dávila. Cortés attacked the Aztec leader with his lance, and the rest of his captains broke the ranks of the warriors around him. Matlatzincatl was slain by Juan de Salamanca, who retrieved the Aztec battle-standard and delivered it to Cortés. With their leader slain, the Aztec force diminished gradually, and the Tlaxcalan and Castilian warriors routed them.\n\nWith this hard-fought victory, the Spanish conquistadors were able to reach the safe haven of Tlaxcala, regroup and gather their strength for an eventual counter-attack deep into the Aztec territory, which would result in the fall of Tenochtitlán and the foundation of New Spain.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "163852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163852", "title": "Calque", "text": "Calque\n\nIn linguistics, a calque or loan translation is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal, word-for-word or root-for-root translation. Used as a verb, \"to calque\" means to borrow a word or phrase from another language while translating its components, so as to create a new lexeme in the target language.\n\n\"Calque\" itself is a loanword from the French noun \"calque\" (\"tracing; imitation; close copy\"); the verb \"calquer\" means \"to trace; to copy, to imitate closely\"; \"papier calque\" is \"tracing paper\". The word \"loanword\" is itself a calque of the German word \"Lehnwort\", just as \"loan translation\" is a calque of \"Lehnübersetzung\".\n\nProving that a word is a calque sometimes requires more documentation than does an untranslated loanword because, in some cases, a similar phrase might have arisen in both languages independently. This is less likely to be the case when the grammar of the proposed calque is quite different from that of the borrowing language, or when the calque contains less obvious imagery.\n\nCalquing is distinct from phono-semantic matching. While calquing includes semantic translation, it does not consist of phonetic matching (i.e. retaining the approximate sound of the borrowed word through matching it with a similar-sounding pre-existing word or morpheme in the target language).\n\nOne system classifies calques into five groups:\n\n\nThis terminology is not universal. Some authors call a morphological calque a \"morpheme-by-morpheme translation\".\n\nOther linguists refer to the phonological calque, where the pronunciation of a word is imitated in the other language. For example, the English word \"radar\" becomes the similar-sounding Chinese word \"\"雷达\"\" (pinyin \"léi dá\").\n\nLoan blends or partial calques translate some parts of a compound, but not others. For example, the name of the Irish digital television service Saorview is a partial calque of that of the UK service Freeview, translating the first half of the word from English to Irish but leaving the second half unchanged. Other examples are: \"liverwurst\" (< German \"Leberwurst\"), \"apple strudel\" (< German \"Apfelstrudel\").\n\nThe common English phrase \"flea market\" is a phraseological calque of the French \"marché aux puces\" (\"market with fleas\"). Other national variations include:\n\nAn example of a common morpheme-by-morpheme loan-translation in a multitude of languages is that of the English word \"skyscraper\":\nThe Latin word \"translatio\" (\"a transferring\") derives from \"trans\", \"across\" + \"latus\", \"borne\". (\"Latus\" is the past participle of \"ferre\", \"to carry\".)\n\nThe Germanic languages and some Slavic languages calqued their words for \"translation\" from the Latin word, \"translatio\", substituting their respective Germanic or Slavic root words for the Latin roots.\n\nThe remaining Slavic languages instead calqued their words for \"translation\" from an alternative Latin word, \"traductio\", itself derived from \"traducere\" (\"to lead across\" or \"to bring across\", from \"trans\", \"across\" + \"ducere\", \"to lead\" or \"to bring\").\n\nThe West Slavic languages adopted the \"translatio\" pattern. The East Slavic languages (except for Belarusian and Ukrainian) and the South Slavic languages adopted the \"traductio\" pattern.\n\nThe Romance languages, deriving directly from Latin, did not need to \"calque\" their equivalent words for \"translation\". Instead, they simply adapted the second of the two alternative Latin words, traductio. Thus, Aragonese: ; Catalan: ; French: ; Italian: ; Portuguese: ; Romanian: ; and Spanish: . \n\nThe English verb \"to translate\" similarly derives from the Latin \"translatio\", itself derived from \"transferre\", \"to transfer\": in this case, \"transferred\" (\"translatus\") from one language to another. Were the English verb \"translate\" calqued, it would be \"overset\", akin to the calques in other Germanic languages.\n\nFollowing are the Germanic- and Slavic-language calques for \"translation\":\n\nThe computer mouse was named in English for its resemblance to the animal. Many other languages have extended their own native word for \"mouse\" to include the computer mouse. \n\n\n"}

Along with the Children of the Chapel, they were the most important of the companies of boy players that constituted a distinctive feature of English Renaissance theatre.\n\nThe children who would become choirboys and boy players for the Children of Paul's ranged in age from six to their mid-teens. They would be educated and boarded at the choir school, trained in not only singing but in grammar and literacy. Although their basic needs were taken care of, choirboys sometimes made some money for themselves. When fashionably dressed men wearing spurs, which could be loud and distracting to other church-goers, would enter the chapel, the choirboys would sometimes demand money as a fee. This fee was called \"spur money\". Choirboys were allowed time to play on Thursday afternoons, and in one document from 1598, a verger named John Howe notes an occasion when the boys broke windows and disrupted churchgoers.\nSt. Paul's Cathedral in London had a boys' choir since the 12th century; it was only in the 16th century that they began to act in dramatic performances. Playing may have become a part of the boys' education as a result of the influence of humanist teachings, which encouraged students to \"develop poise and improve their skill in speaking Latin by acting\"\n\nIn 1527-1528, the Children of Paul's performed for King Henry VIII, and for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.\n\nSebastian Westcott was Master of the Children of Paul's in the years 1557–82; in his era, the boys performed 27 times at court, more than any other troupe, adult or child. In 1560-1572 Master of the Revels Sir Thomas Benger used them throughout his tenure, as later mentioned in William Shakespeare' play \"Hamlet\", Act 2 Scene 2. One example is when the company performed for Queen Elizabeth and her guest at the time, Cecilia of Sweden, in 1566. They performed a play by Sixt Birk, called Sapientia Solomonis, which \"dramatized the relationship between King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba in a way appropriate for schoolboys\". Under Master Thomas Giles (1584–99?), the Children of Paul's became closely identified with the plays of John Lyly; they performed at Court nine times in the years 1587–90. The boys acted Lyly's \"Gallathea\" at Court, probably on 1 January 1588; they acted his \"Endymion\" at Court a month and a day later, on 2 February; and his \"Midas\" on 6 January 1590. Other of Lyly's plays, \"Mother Bombie\" and \"Love's Metamorphosis\", were also presented at Court in these years.\n\nAlso in the 1580s the Children of Paul's joined the Children of the Chapel in public performances at the first Blackfriars Theatre (1583–4), a foretaste of the period of public performance that was to follow for both companies at the start of the 17th century.\n\nIn 1590, the Children of Paul's were implicated in the Martin Marprelate controversy, as not only were they associated with John Lyly, they had \"helped to publicise his contributions\". All theatrical companies, including adult companies, were forced to curb their productions. Boy companies became scarce until the Children of Paul's returned a decade later at the turn of the century, in 1599-1600. By the time of its reopening, the Children of Paul's may have had up to seventeen boy players (84 Roslyn Lander Knutson). For the next ten years the boy companies were out of fashion on the stage.\n\nBy 1600, conditions had changed; a new Master, Edward Peers (d.1612), allowed the Children of Paul's to resume acting, and apparently faced no significant opposition. The company operated at a smaller scale than before, though, only playiing on Sundays and Mondays and charging half the amount for the attendance fee than they had in 1590. The anonymous plays \"The Maid's Metamorphosis\" and \"The Wisdom of Doctor Dodypoll\" illustrate the kind of drama the boys acted in their first year. The Children of Paul's performed the works of John Marston, George Chapman, and Thomas Middleton, among other dramatists of their generation. Marston was mainly identified with the Children of Paul's, as Jonson was identified with the Children of the Chapel; in the \"Poetomachia\", the War of the Theatres of 1599–1601, the Children of Paul's acted Marston's side of the contest, with the plays \"Jack Drum's Entertainment\" (1600) and \"What You Will\" (1601), plus Thomas Dekker's \"Satiromastix\" (1601).\n\nHowever, unlike the Children of the Chapel, who worked in the second Blackfriars Theatre, the Children of Paul's had no dedicated theatrical space of their own; when they weren't playing at Court, they acted in the church where they trained as choristers – St Gregory by St Paul's Church, just to the southwest of St Paul's Cathedral. This tended to limit their drama; sometimes plays had to be cut short to accommodate the schedules of the religious institutions in the middle of which the boy players operated.\n\nThe Children of Paul's ceased playing around 1606, for unclear reasons. Some scholars have believed that the King's Revels Children, another company that formed c. 1606, might have been, to some significant degree, the Children of Paul's under another name; but this is uncertain. (The King's Revels Children never gelled as an enterprise; they collapsed in litigation among their backers in 1609.)\n\nHowever, instead of disappearing altogether, it could also be that the company simply merged with the Children of the Blackfriars. \n\nno. 1, 2016, p. 179–196. \"EBSCOhost\", https://dx.doi.org/10.12745/et.19.2.2837.\n2004, p. 315.\n"}

The position is a counterpoint to theistic evolution and is endorsed by those who believe in both deism and the veracity of science.\n\nIn \"Christian Theology\", by Millard J. Erickson, 2013, is written:\n\nThe psychologist Steve Stewart-Williams in his book \"Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life\" (2010) states:\n\nStewart-Williams further writes that deistic evolution strips God of what most religious believers consider central. Any deistic God is not around for prayers, miracles or to intervene in people's lives and that because of this it is unpopular with monotheistic religions.\n\nDeistic Evolution adheres to the concept of some form of God, but denies any personal God. A recent defender of deistic evolution was Michael Anthony Corey, author of the book \"Back to Darwin: The Scientific Case for Deistic Evolution\" (1994).\n\nSome scholars have written that Charles Darwin was an advocate of deistic evolution.\n\nDeistic evolution is similarly the operative idea in Pandeism, which has been counted amongst the handful of spiritual beliefs which \"are compatible with modern science.\" and specifically wherein it is noted that \"\"pandeistic\" belief systems ... [present] the inclusion of God as the ever unfolding expression of a complex universe with an identifiable beginning but no teleological direction necessarily present.\"\n\nDeistic evolution is not the same as theistic evolution, yet they are sometimes confused. The difference rests on the difference between a theistic god that is interested in, if not actively involved in, the outcome of his creation and humanity specifically and a deistic god that is either disinterested in the outcome, and holds no special place for humanity, or will not intervene. Often, there is no discernible difference between the two positions—the choice of terminology has more to do with the believer and her or his need for a god, than fitting into a mostly arbitrary dictionary or academic definition.\n\nDeistic evolution has been criticised by Christian creationists as being incompatible with Christianity since it contradicts a literal reading of the Bible and more importantly, leaves no role for the \"Christian personal God\".\n\nM. J. Erickson wrote that deistic evolution is in conflict with the scriptural doctrine of providence according to which \"God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation.\"\n\nCharles P. Grannan wrote in 1894, \"Another baseless assumption of negative critics is that the general principles of Atheistic and Deistic evolution, admitted by many scientists to account for the origin of the various species of plants and animals, should also be applied to explain the origin of the Christian religion.\"\n\nCharles Wesley Rishell criticized the concept in 1899, comparing it to the notion (false, in his view), that gravity was a property of matter instead of a continued action of God:\n\nDeistic evolution does not oppose or contradict evolution or come into conflict with science as it says that a God started the process and then left it to natural processes. However deism is still a religious philosophy.\n\nStewart-Williams wrote regarding deistic evolution and science:\n\nThere is considerable room for this \"god of the gaps\" view, since scientific observation is entirely unable to shed any light on what happened during the Planck epoch, the earliest 10 seconds in the history of the universe. All development since this initial creative act merely follows laws and principles which He created:\n\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church disagrees with the doctrine of deistic evolution. In November 2005, Pope Benedict addressed a general audience of 25,000 in St. Peter's Square:\n\n"}

He's known mostly for his essay \"Description of the city of Altamura\" (, 1688),which was the first complete essay on the history of Altamura, Kingdom of Naples (Italy).\n\nIn his work, the author provides precious information on the history and the life of Altamura, perhaps drawing from documents now lost. The work has also been copied by priest D. Vitangelo Frizzale. The clearest limit of his work is perhaps the absence of critical analysis of the socurces, and the commingling of history and legendary facts, as Ottavio Serena later pointed out.\n\nThere is very little or no information on his life. Local historian Tommaso Berloco claimed that he may have been a jurist and that he belonged to a noble family living in Altamura, which originated in Caserta. According to more recent research, it was a physician (then called \"dottor fisico\"). His only work - \"Descrizione della città di Altamura\" (1688) - provided plenty of information about the history of the city of Altamura. A street in Altamura has been named after him.\n\nCesare Orlandi, in his work \"Delle Città d'Italia\" (1770) mentions Giovanni Donato, which was also a jurist from Altamura and he was more famous than him. Local historian Tommaso Berloco suggested that Orlandi mentioned Donato in order to thank him for the source, and he suggested that Giovanni Donato may have used pseudonym \"Domenico Santoro\". Another hypothesis is that Giovanni Donato was a relative of Domenico Santoro's.\n\nThe original edition of his work, as well as the following, went lost. The manuscript which survived dates back to the XIX century or the early years of the XX century. Even though the manuscript is a faithful reproduction of his original work, it contains a few copying mstakes and parts added by other writers.\n"}
{"id": "4153008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4153008", "title": "Ethnohistory", "text": "Ethnohistory\n\nEthnohistory is the study of cultures and indigenous peoples' customs by examining historical records as well as other sources of information on their lives and history. It is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not still exist. The term is most commonly used in writing about the history of the Americas.\n\nEthnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the use of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and placenames.\n\nScholars studying the history of Mexico's indigenous have a long tradition, dating back to the colonial era; they used alphabetic texts and other sources to write the history of Mexico's indigenous peoples. The \"Handbook of Middle American Indians\", edited by archeologist Robert Wauchope was involved with creating a multiple volumes on Mesoamerican ethnohistory, published as \"Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources\", appearing in 1973. At the time that the volumes were published, \"both the term 'ethnohistory' and its concepts in the sense used here have entered the literature rather recently and are not fully agreed upon.\" The volumes were intended to be an inventory of sources \"which in later hands could utilize to produce professionally acceptable ethnohistory.\"\n\nIn the mid to late 20th century, a number of ethnohistorians of Mexico began to systematically publish many colonial alphabetic texts in indigenous Mexican languages, in a branch of ethnohistory currently known as the New Philology. That built on an earlier tradition of practitioners writing the history of Mexico that fully integrated the history of its indigenous peoples.\n\nIn the United States, the field arose out of the study of American Indian communities required by the Indian Claims Commission. It gained a pragmatic rather than a theoretical orientation, with practitioners testifying both for and against Indian claims. The emerging methodology used documentary historical sources and ethnographic methods. Among the scholars working on the cases was Latin Americanist Howard F. Cline, who was commissioned to work on Florda Indians and Jicarilla Apache. \n\nThe field has also reached into Melanesia, where recent European contact allowed researchers to observe the early postcontact period directly and to address important theoretical questions. Michael Harkin argues that ethnohistory was part of the general rapprochement between history and anthropology in the late 20th century.\n\nEthnohistory grew organically thanks to external nonscholarly pressures, without an overarching figure or conscious plan; even so, it came to engage central issues in cultural and historical analysis. Ethnohistorians take pride in using their special knowledge of specific groups, their linguistic insights, and their interpretation of cultural phenomena. They claim to achieve a more in-depth analysis than the average historian is capable of doing based solely on written documents produced by and for one group. They try to understand culture on its own terms and according to its own cultural code. Ethnohistory differs from other historically-related methodologies in that it embraces emic perspectives as tools of analysis. The field and its techniques are well suited for writing histories of Native American peoples because of its holistic and inclusive framework. It is especially important because of its ability to bridge differing frameworks and access a more informed context for interpretations of the past.\n\nThe definition of the field has become more refined over the years. Early on, ethnohistory differed from history proper in that it added a new dimension, specifically \"the critical use of ethnological concepts and materials in the examination and use of historical source material,\" as described by William N. Fenton. Later, James Axtell described ethnohistory as \"the use of historical and ethnological methods to gain knowledge of the nature and causes of change in a culture defined by ethnological concepts and categories.\" Others have focused this basic concept on previously ignored historical actors. Ed Schieffelin asserted, for example, that ethnohistory must fundamentally take into account the people's own sense of how events are constituted, and their ways of culturally constructing the past. Finally, Simmons formulated his understanding of ethnohistory as \"a form of cultural biography that draws upon as many kinds of testimony as possible over as long a time period as the sources allow.\" He described ethnohistory as an endeavor based on a holistic, diachronic approach that is most rewarding when it can be \"joined to the memories and voices of living people.\"\n\nReflecting upon the history of ethnohistory as research field in the US, Harkin has situated it within the broader context of convergences and divergences of the fields of history and anthropology and the special circumstances of American Indian land claims and legal history in North American in the mid-20th century.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14047340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14047340", "title": "Gagra choli", "text": "Gagra choli\n\nGagra choli or ghagra choli, which is also known as lehenga choli and locally as chaniya choli, is the traditional clothing of women from the Indian subcontinent, notable in Indian states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu, as well as in Nepal. In Punjab it was traditionally worn with the kurti and salwar. It is a combination of the \"gagra\" or \"lehenga\" (long skirt) and the \"choli\" (blouse).\n\nHistorically, the gagra choli evolved from the three-piece attire worn by women in ancient India. The attire consisted of the \"antriya\" lower garment, the \"uttariya\" veil worn over shoulder or head and \"stanapatta\" a chestband, which finds mentioned in Sanskrit literature and Buddhist Pali literature during the 6th century B.C.\n\nA \"choli\" (Hindi: चोली, ), (\"ravike\" in South India Telugu: రవికె, Kannada: ರವಿಕೆ) is a midriff-baring blouse commonly worn with the Indian sari costume (worn in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and other surrounding countries). It evolved from the ancient \"Stanapatta\" (also known as \"Kanchuki\") and is cut to fit tightly to the body with its short sleeves and low neck. The choli is usually cropped, allowing exposure of the navel; the cropped design is particularly well-suited for wear in the hot summers of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\"Lehenga\", \"gagra\"/\"ghagra\" (Hindi: घाघरा \"ghāghrā\") also \"chaniya\" (known as \"pavadai\" in Tamil: பாவாடை) is a form of skirt which is long, embroidered and pleated. It is secured at the waist or hips and leaves the lower back and midriff bare. The ancient version of skirt or \"ghagri\" evolved from \"bhairnivasani\", which in turn evolved from the antriya when stitching on one side became tabular and was worn gathered together at the waist, and held by a girdle. This was one of the earliest forms of a clumsily stitched skirt. It was worn using a \"nada\" or drawstring. The \"ghagri\" was a narrow skirt long—the same length as the original \"antriya\"—and can still be seen worn by Jain nuns in India.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, women irrespective of class largely wore gagras which reached down to ankles, especially in the Hindi belt. This was largely due to jeweled toes indicating the marital status of women, as both married and unmarried women observed the ghoonghat veil. Gagras were made out of two to three layers of coarse khadi fabric which created large flared look and remained largely plain but were decorated with \"gota\" and \"badla\" embroidery on special occasions. Most commonly used dyes were indigo, lac and turmeric. This style can still be seen in rural areas of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh & Madhya Pradesh particularly during folk festivals.\n\nThe ancient, unstitched form of gagra has survived in folk theater costumes across India, particularly in Kathakali of Kerala, where layers of pleated khadi fabric are laid over a nada and tied around the waist, creating layers of flared skirt. This reflects the simplistic early style of unstitched gagras worn in ancient times. \n\nThe dupatta (Hindi: दुपट्टा, Urdu: دوپٹا) or chunri (known as \"oṛna\" in Bengali: ওড়না) is a scarf that is like a shawl and is worn with the gagra and choli. It is also used as part of the women's shalwar kameez costume. It is an evolved form of the Uttariya. Until the early 21st century, the dupatta was the most decorative part of gagra choli, while the rest of the garment was plainer, especially the gagra was an everyday one. Dupatta is worn in many regional styles across India. The most common style since early medieval times was to pleat the dupatta on one end, so it can be anchored by tucking it into the front waist of the gagra. The loose end is then wrapped across the waist and/or draped diagonally across the upper body to fall over the shoulder, or up and over to cover the head. This is similar to the way a sari is generally worn. Women farming or doing manual work tuck both ends of the dupatta into their choli.\n\nThe dupatta is traditionally seen as a symbol of modesty, as its main purpose is to serve as a veil. There is no single way of wearing it, so as time passed and fashion changed, the styling of the dupatta also evolved.\n\nThe lehengas are made of a number of fabrics such as silk, cotton, khadi, georgette, crape, net, satin, brocade and chiffon. Although designers have successfully used various fabrics for lehenga, silk is still the preferred fabric.\n\nApart from the fabric, decorative stitching patterns also play a role. Lehengas come with a wide variety of decoration and embroidery work like Gota, Phulkari, Shisha, Chikankari, Zari, Zardozi, Nakshi, Kundan, etc. For festivals like Navratri, the ethnic Shisha embroidery is popular with a bit of patchwork. For formal wear and weddings, the embroidery is heavier in pearls, silk, sequins and zari.\n\nKutch embroidery is an evolving expression of the craft and textile traditions of the Rabaris, a nomadic tribe in Gujarat. Kutch embroidery is unique in the sense that a net is woven on a cloth using thread.The net is then filled in using the same thread by intricate interlocking stitches. The patterns are usually built around geometric shapes.This embroidery follows its own traditional design logic and juxtaposition of colours and motifs. The Rohanas tribals of Kutch specialise in skirt work. The Sodhas use a geometric style for their embroidery. The Garacia Jats are experts in tiny embroidery on the yoke, which intermingles with red, orange, blue and green threads. The Dhanetah Jats love embroidering broad pear-shaped mirrors using orange, black, yellow and red in chain stitch.\n\nThe lehenga choli is the favourite female apparel worn during festivals, weddings or special events in India. This is due to traditions as well as of the fact that it is available in a number of fabrics with many different decorative choices. Traditionally the sari and the lehenga choli are the most popular garments for the bride in India. This is a common bridal attire mostly in North India and is also the traditional wear of Garba festival in Gujarat.\n\nIn southern India, coming of age ceremony or rites of passage (\"langa voni\" Telugu: లంగా వోని, \"Pattu Pavadai\" Tamil: பட்டு பாவாடை, \"Langa Davani\" Kannada: ಲಂಗ ದ್ವನಿ) are celebrated when a girl reaches puberty. She wears langa voni during the first part of the ceremony and then she is given her first sari, which she wears during the second half of the ceremony. This marks her transition into womanhood.\n\nThe tradition of presenting langa voni begins with the girl's first naming ceremony called Namakaran and her first rice feeding ceremony called Annaprashana. She receives her last one at her coming of age ceremony. Langa voni is traditional clothing for unmarried girls in southern India.\n\nLuanchari (Hindi: लुआंचणी) is a full-dress garment. The luanchari is made up of two parts. The upper part is called choli, and is made of the same fabric as of the lehanga, but it is not uncommon to find the two pieces of the garment in different colours. The choli is stitched to the lehanga, to make a one-piece luanchari. This is commonly worn by the women in Pahari miniatures, and is quite similar to lehanga. It may take over 21 yards of cloth to make a complete luanchari. It is a traditional garment worn by Gaddis of Himachal Pradesh.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13088441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13088441", "title": "Headwater Diversion Plan (Jordan River)", "text": "Headwater Diversion Plan (Jordan River)\n\nThe Headwater Diversion Plan was an Arab League plan to divert two of the three sources of the Jordan River, and prevent them from flowing into the Sea of Galilee, in order to thwart Israel's plans to use the water of the Hasbani and Banias in its National Water Carrier project for out of Basin irrigation. The plan was approved by the Arab League in 1964 but Israel prevented the project's development by conducting airstrikes in Syrian territory in April 1967.\n\nIn 1955 the Unified (Johnston) Plan for the multinational development of Jordan River basin between the riparian rights holders was finalized. The Plan was accepted by the technical committees from both Israel and the Arab League. A discussion in the Knesset in July 1955 ended without a vote. The Arab Experts Committee approved the plan in September 1955 and referred it for final approval to the Arab League Council. On 11 October 1955, the Council voted not to ratify the plan, due to the League's opposition to formal recognition of Israel. After the Suez Crisis of 1956 however, the Arab states (with the exception of Jordan) considerably hardened their position against Israel, and now opposed the plan, arguing that by strengthening its economy the plan would increase the potential threat from Israel. The Arab leadership also argued that the increase to Israel's water supply would encourage the immigration of more Jewish settlers, thus reducing the possibility of repatriation for Palestinian refugees of the 1948 war. However, Nasser, the Egyptian president, assured the Americans that the Arabs would not exceed the water quotas prescribed by the Johnston plan\n\nNevertheless, both Jordan and Israel undertook to operate within the allocations laid out within the \"Johnston Plan\" . Two civil engineering projects were completed successfully; the diversion of water from the Jordan River (1.7 million cubic metres in a day) at Eshed Kinrot, carried by the Israeli National Water Carrier from 1955 to 1964 and the Jordanian construction of the East Ghor Canal (now known as the King Abdullah Canal) from 1957 to 1966.\n\nIn 1964 when Israel's National Water Carrier was nearing completion, the second Arab League summit conference voted on a plan designed to circumvent and frustrate it. Their resolution stated: The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its entirety has agreed to forestall. And Since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel.\n\nThe Arab and North African states chose to divert the Jordan headwaters rather than to use direct military intervention. The heads of State of the Arab League considered two options:\n\nThe second option was selected. The scheme was only marginally feasible, was technically difficult and expensive. Arab political considerations were cited to justify the diversion scheme. Syria began its part of the overall Arab diversion plan with the construction of the Banias to Yarmouk canal in 1965, with financing from Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Once completed, the diversion of the flow would have transported the water into a dam at Mukhaiba for use by Jordan and Syria and prevent the water from reaching the Sea of Galilee. Lebanon also started a canal to divert the waters of the Hasbani, whose source is in Lebanon, into the Banias. The Hasbani and Banias diversion works would have had the effect of reducing the capacity of the Israeli carrier from the Sea of Galilee by about 35% and Israel's overall water supply by about 11%. Additionally, it would have increased the salinity of the Sea of Galilee by 60 ppm. \n\nIsrael declared that it would regard such diversion as an infringement of its sovereign rights. Israel exploited the DMZ incidents as pretexts for bombing the diversion project, culminating in air strikes deep in Syrian territory in April 1967.\n\nThe increase in water-related Arab-Israeli hostility was a major factor leading to the June 1967 Six-Day War.\n\n"}

His adopted middle name of Bialynia refers to the clan and Coat of Arms of his family. Chołodecki was the son of Celestyn, a writer and a \"nadleśniczy\" of the forestry department in Galicia, and Emilia from the house of Setti da Forli. His academic studies began at home, and continued at primary school in Stryj located in present-day Ukraine. He attended high school in Lwów, and took his maturity exam on 10 October 1870. That same year he enrolled at the University of Lwów to study law, graduating in 1874.\n\nHe had to work even while attending high school due to his father's death. In 1873, a year prior to finishing his law degree, Józef applied to the Directors of the Lwów postal service. He received a position with the postal service in Czerlany, later in Niżniów, Stanisławów, and finally in Lwów. In 1880 he became the regional director of the commisars postal service in Czerniowce, he quickly rose up the ranks of the postal service until he became the director of the account departments of the Lwów postal service. He retired while at this position in 1909. \n\nChołodecki left his home with a strong patriotic tradition. His father, who took part in two uprisings and was jailed as a political dissident as a result, as well as other close family like Tomasz Chołodecki, a veteran of the November Uprising, had a strong influence on his upbringing. At the age of 12, he took part in the January Uprising of 1863 as courier in the territories surrounding Lwów. In 1867 while still in high school he was part of an underground student organization which was later dissolved by the Austrian authorities. While a student at the University of Lwów, Chołodecki was the most active member of the highly regarded Academic Reading room (\"Czytelnia Akademicka\"), he took an active part in an assortment of Polish organizations throughout the region. In Czerniowce he became a contributor to \"Gazeta Polska\", a newspaper run by Klemens Kościesz Kołakowski. He became a member of the board of \"Czytelnia Polska\", founded a library and wrote a history of the \"Czytelnia\" in 1885. \n\nIn his first literary endeavors, books and pamphlets printed from the presses of \"Gazeta Polska\", Chołodecki wrote under the pseudonym of Walenty Ćwik, this included his historical book about Bukowina in 1884, an examination of the history of the Polish Navy and Polish artillery in 1885, and a biography of Henryk Schmitt in 1888. He used an assumed name fearing repression by the Austrian authorities. Finally he presented his literary ambitions to the minister of trade, and due to his influence through his position at the postal service in Lwów, he was granted the right to publish books under his name.\n\nAfter moving to Lwów, Chołodecki joined numerous organizations, becoming the president of the Postal Club, and he was able to create many other organizations that were able to grow through his support. He was verbally attacked by the president of the Lwów postal service, a man surnamed Seferowicz, in 1906 for his vigorous activity in these organizations, which the President claimed discredited him as a director at the Lwów postal service. \n\nChołodecki vehemntly denied the charge and accused Seferowicz of a personal attack. Chołodecki was also part of many of intellectual circles and organizations, including the Organization for Polish Education, the Heraldic Organization, Organization of Studies in Przemyśl, and the Organization of Lwów Historians (\"Tow. Miłośników przeszłości Lwowa\"), which printed many of his most famous and renowned works. Between 1902 and 1908 Chołodecki was a \"radny\" for the city of Lwów.

Lords Protectors) is a title that has been used in British constitutional law for the head of state. It is also a particular title for the British heads of state in respect to the established church. It is sometimes used to refer to holders of other temporary posts, for example, a regent acting for the absent monarch.\n\nThe title of \"The Lord Protector\" was originally used by royal princes or other nobles exercising an individual regency (i.e. not merely as a member of a collegial regency council) while the English monarch was still a minor or otherwise unable to rule.\n\nNotable cases in England are:\nand in Scotland:\n\nThe Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland was the title of the head of state during the Commonwealth (or, to monarchists, the Interregnum), following the first period when a Council of State held executive power. The title was held by Oliver Cromwell (December 1653 – September 1658) and subsequently his son and designated successor Richard Cromwell (September 1658 – May 1659) during what is now known as The Protectorate.\n\nThe 1653 Instrument of Government (republican constitution) stated that—\nOliver Cromwell, Captain-General of the forces of England, Scotland and Ireland, shall be, and is hereby declared to be, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, and the dominions thereto belonging, for his life.\n\nThe replacement constitution of 1657, the Humble Petition and Advice, gave \"His Highness the Lord Protector\" the power to nominate his successor. Cromwell chose his eldest surviving son, the politically inexperienced Richard. This was a non-representative and de facto dynastic mode of succession, with royal connotations in both styles awarded, (even a double invocation 16 December 1653 – 3 September 1658 \"By the Grace of God and Republic Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland\") and many other monarchic prerogatives, such as that of awarding knighthoods.\n\nThe younger Cromwell, who succeeded on his father's death in September 1658, held the position for only eight months before resigning in May 1659, being followed by the second period of Commonwealth rule until the Restoration of the exiled heir to the Stuart throne Charles II in May 1660.\n\nSince the Restoration the title has not been used in either of the above manners. George, Prince of Wales, appointed to the regency in 1811, was referred to as \"His Royal Highness the Prince Regent\". George exercised the powers of the monarchy, just as Lords Protectors had, but the title's republican associations had rendered it distasteful.\n\nLord Protector has also been used as a rendering of the Latin \"Advocatus\" in the sense of a temporal Lord (such as a Monarch) who acted as the protector of the mainly secular interests of a part of the church; compare vidame.\n\n"}

Although he was a 20th-century poet, his poems are fairly traditional and strongly nationalistic in character.\n\nMohammad-Taqí Bahār was born on December 9, 1886. His father was Mohammad Kazem Sabouri, and his mother was Sakineh Tehrani (daughter of Haj Abbas Gholi Tehrani). in the Sarshoor District of Mashhad, the capital city of the Khorasan Province in the north-east of Iran. Bahār began his primary education when he was three, with his father, Mohammad Kāzem Sabouri, as his tutor. Mohammad Kāzem Sabouri was the Poet Laureate of the shrine in Mashad and had the honorific title of \"Malek o-Sho'arā\", The King of Poets.\n\nIn addition to his private schooling, Bahār attended one of the traditional schools, \"Maktab Khāneh\", in Mashhad. To enhance his knowledge of the Persian and Arabic, he further attended the classes of Adib Nai'shābouri, a traditional poet and literary scholar who promoted the style of the poets of Khorasan in the early Islamic era, in the tradition of the so-called \"bāzgasht-e adabī\" (literary regress). It has been said that Bahār knew by heart a very good portion of the Koran at a very early age. According to Bahār himself, at seven he read Shahnameh and fully grasped the meaning of Ferdowsi's Epic poems.\n\nBahār composed his first poem at age eight, at which time he also chose the name \"Bahār\", meaning Spring, as his pen name (\"takhallos\" in Persian). It is known that Bahār chose this pen name after Bahār Shirvāni, a poet and close friend of his father's, after Shirvāni's death. Shirvāni was a renowned poet during Nasser-al-Din Shah Qajar.\n\nAt 14, Bahār was fluent in Arabic, and later he achieved spoken and written fluency in French. At 18, he lost his father and started to work as a Muslim preacher and clergy. It was during this time that he composed a long ode (\"Qasideh\" in Persian) and sent it to Mozzafar-al-Din Shah who became so deeply impressed by this ode that he immediately appointed Bahār as his Poet Laureate and by Royal Decree conferred on him, at the age of 19 (1903), the title of \"Malek o-Sho'arā\" at the shrine of Imam REZA in Mashad.\n\nAt the onset of the Constitutional Revolution of Iran (1906–1911), Bahār laid down his position of Poet Laureateship and joined the revolutionary movement for establishing the parliamentary system of democracy in Iran. Bahār became an active member of the Mashhad branch of \"Anjoman-e Sa'ādat\" (Society for Prosperity) that campaigned for establishment of Parliament of Iran (\"Majles\"). He published the semi-covert newspaper \"Khorāsān\", in collaboration with Hossein Ardebili, \"Nou-bahār\" (New Spring), and \"Tāzeh-bahār\" (Fresh Spring), both in collaboration with his cousin Haj Sheikh Ahmad Bahar who operated a printing company and who acted as the Senior Editor first in Mashhad and later in Tehran.\n\nBahār published numerous articles in his newspapers in which he passionately exhorted his readers to stand up and help bring about the establishment of a functioning Parliament. He equally forcefully advocated creation of new and reformed public institutions, a new social and political order and of new forms of expression. After the triumph of the Constitutional Revolution, Bahār was repeatedly elected as Member of Parliament.\n\nIn 1918, when Ahmad Shah Qajar, the seventh and the last ruler of the Qajar dynasty, was in power, Bahār reinvented himself: he ceased all his clerical activities and became an entirely new man. At the same time, he together with the writer and poet Saeed Nafisi, the poet and historian Gholam-Reza Rashid Yasemi the historian Abbas Eqbāl Ashtiāni, and his talented friend Abdolhossein Teymourtash founded The Literary Association of the Academy (\"Anjoman-e Adabi-ye Dāneshkadeh\"). The Magazine of the Academy (\"Majaleh-ye Dāneshkadeh\") was the monthly publication of this Association, in which, in addition to works of prose and poetry, other very informative and useful articles were published, under such divers titles as \"Literary Revolution\", \"How other nations view us\" and \"The Literary History of Iran\". In fact, this magazine became Bahār's vehicle for publication of the results of his literary researches and introduction of Western Literature to Iranians. The magazine also played a key role in developing and strengthening the present-day form of Persian Literature.\n\nFollowing establishment of Tehran University in 1934 (during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi), Bahār became Professor of Persian Literature at the Faculty of Literature of this University. In the course of his tenure as Professor, he dedicated most of his time to writing and editing books on Persian Literature and History. Notable amongst numerous works written and edited by Bahār are:\n\n\nIn 1945, during Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi's reign, Bahār served for a short period as the Minister of Culture and Education in the Cabinet of the then Prime Minister Ahmad Ghavam (aka Ghavam o-Saltaneh). Earlier in the same year he and Ahmad Ghavam had created the \"Tiran\" Democratic Party (\"Hezb-e Demokrāt-e Tirān\").\n\nIn the last years of his life, Bahār suffered from Tuberculosis. He sought medical treatment in Leysin, Switzerland, in a sanatorium, where he stayed between 1947 and 1949. It was not long after his return to Iran that his health quickly deteriorated. He died on April 21, 1951, at his home in Tehran. He is entombed in Zahir o-Dowleh Cemetery in Darband, located in Shemiran, north of Tehran.\n\nAlthough Bahār was a 20th-century poet, his poems are quite traditional and decidedly patriotic. Many scholars have strongly emphasized and documented that Bahār's style of writing and the beauty of his poetry, in addition to his deep passion for Iran and his persistent opposition to fanaticism, have indeed made him one of the greatest cultural icons of modern Iran. Although he worked for some period of time as a clergyman and preacher, his first and foremost passion had always been writing, especially of poetry, as well as carrying out historical researches and teaching.\n\nThrough his literary magazine, The Magazine of the Academy (\"Majaleh-ye Dāneshkadeh\"), Bahār had a significant impact on the development of modern Persian poetry and literature. One may argue that, to varying degrees, almost all the early advocates of modernism in Persian Poetry and Literature found their inspirations in the new developments and changes that had taken place in Western literature. Nonetheless, such inspirations would not have easily resulted in changes without the efforts and support of such figures as Bahār, whose literary contributions were, and remain consonant with Iranian culture. In Bahār's collection of poems, one finds poems composed in almost every tradition of Persian Poetry. To name a few, he wrote Panegyric (\"Setāyeshi\" or \"Madiheh\"), Epic (\"Hamāsi\"), Patriotic (\"Mihaní\"), Heraldic and Mystic (\"Ramzi\" or \"Sufi'āneh\"), Romantic (\"Āasheghāneh\"), Ethical (\"Akhlāghi\"), Didactic (\"Āmuzeshi\" or \"Pandi\"), Colloquial (\"Goft-o-gu'í\"), and Satirical (\"Tanzi\" or \"Hajvi\"). Bahār's Official Website has made a selection of Bahār's poetry available to the general public, which the interested reader may wish to consult.\n\nThe Chained White Beast is a poem by Bahar, in which he praises Damavand, the highest mountain in Iran, and presents it as a symbol of patriotism. The poem is written in 1922, at the height of the reign of Reza Shah, the tyrant and modernist king of Iran. While Reza Shah was trying to limit the power of other institutions, such as parliament and religious system of clergies, the opportunity has come for the nationalists to take the floor and criticize the regime. Bahar’s symbolism for provoking patriotic upheavals is a reflection of the growth for notion of nationalism which had been introduced to Iranians only few decades before. In this passage, Bahar describes Damavand as a beast, and asks it to rise and wipe out the injustice, and let the real Iran flourish.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 2012, it was given the name of the renowned opera singer Maria Bieșu.\n\nThe \"Chişinău National Opera\", the national opera company of Moldova, was founded in the mid-1940s and became a professional company in 1956.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, this theatre was one of the few to retain its own ballet, opera and orchestra, with its own soloists and chorus.\n\nProfessional ballet began in Chişinău in 1957, after a group of Moldovan dancers trained in Leningrad. New works were soon provided for the company: the Moldovan composer Vasile Zagorsky wrote the ballet \"Rassvet\" (Sunrise), while another composer Eduard Lazarev wrote \"Broken Sword\", based on the poem \"Ghosts\", by Mihai Eminescu, a leading Romanian writer.\n\nIn its first ten years, the company added many well-known classical ballets to its repertoire, including \"Giselle\", \"The Sleeping Beauty\", \"Spartacus\" and \"Coppelia\". It toured to Moscow, Kiev and Bulgaria. The most successful of the company’s modern ballet productions was \"A Young Lady and a Hooligan\", based on music by Shostakovitch, in which the lead dancer was Mihai Caftanat, who is still working with the company. Born in Chişinău, Caftanat studied ballet in Moscow, returning to his native city to dance \"Siegfried\", \"Prince Desire\", Arald in \"Broken Sword\" and Antony in \"Antony and Cleopatra\".\n\nOther notable productions at this time were: the \"Carmen Suite\"; \"Sonnets\", using Benjamin Britten’s music; the \"Arabesques\", with Lazarev’s music. Attempts to create national works included the children’s ballet \"Andriesh\" by Zlata Tkach and \"Luceafarul\" by Eugen Doga based on Eminescu’s best-known poem; while \"O Seara de Balet\" re-introduced audiences to the classical choreography of Marius Petipa, Ivanov, Fokine and Gorski. The Kirov Ballet production of \"La Bayadère\" was carefully re-created by Tatiana Leagt and showed how well the company could handle a difficult work requiring first-class performers.\n\nIn 1998, the renowned choreographer Yuri Grigorovich from the Bolshoi came to Chişinău to direct his version of \"The Nutcracker\", originally played at the Bolshoi in 1966. The company now toured to Moscow, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Italy, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Romania, Hungary, Greece, Paris, Tokyo, Johannesburg, Los Angeles. In 1999 it brought productions of Swan Lake and \"Sleeping Beauty\" to the UK. Since 2001 the company performed Grigorovich’s \"Nutcracker\" several times in the UK. This was the first time the production had been seen in this country since the Bolshoi performed it in London in the early seventies. The Moldova National Ballet has toured regularly in Spain since 2005, in January 2007 it performed \"The Best of Tchaikovsky\" in Spain and northern Germany.\n\n"}

As a historian, he is considered a hack, borrowing material from other books and rewriting them under his pseudonym, then publishing and marketing them under the Crouch imprint. Though he was the type of writer/publisher denounced in the following century by writers such as Samuel Butler (\"Prose Observations\") and Alexander Pope (\"The Dunciad\"), more recent assessments of his life and career see him as an important figure in the development of historiography, especially in the popularization of a hitherto high-culture genre of discourse.\nCrouch was one of the authors who covered the 1655 Whitehall Conference to consider the resettlement of the Jews in England (the other being Henry Jessey). The report is found in the 1719 edition of his \"Two Journeys to Jerusalem\". It is different from Jessey’s version in two respects: firstly it actually names the participants and secondly it includes some anti-Semitic additions to the conclusions of the conference.\n\nAround the date September 30, 1681, an unlikely forerunner of \"Readers' Digest\", called \"Historical Rarities in London and Westminster\" was first published by Crouch. Robert Chambers' \"Book of Days\" (1864) elaborated:\n\n\"With probably little education, but something of a natural gift for writing, Crouch had the sagacity to see that the works of the learned, from their form and price, were kept within a narrow circle of readers, while there was a vast multitude outside who were able and willing to read, provided that a literature suited to their means and capacities was supplied to them. He accordingly set himself the task of transfusing large and pompous books into a series of small, cheap volumes, modestly concealing his authorship under his \"nom de plume\".

His enterprise and diligence were rewarded by large sales and considerable wealth.\"\n"}
{"id": "150065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=150065", "title": "Nennius", "text": "Nennius\n\nNennius — or Nemnius or Nemnivus — was a Welsh monk of the 9th century. He has traditionally been attributed with the authorship of the \"Historia Brittonum\", based on the prologue affixed to that work, This attribution is widely considered a secondary (10th century) tradition.\n\nNennius was a student of Elvodugus, commonly identified with the bishop Elfodd of Bangor who convinced British ecclesiastics to accept the Continental dating for Easter, and who died in 809 according to the \"Annales Cambriae\".\n\nNennius is believed to have lived in the area made up by Brecknockshire and Radnorshire in present-day Powys, Wales. Thus, he lived outside the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, isolated by mountains in a rural society. Because of the lack of evidence concerning the life of Nennius he has become the subject of legend himself. Welsh traditions include Nennius with Elbodug and others said to have escaped the massacre of Welsh monks by Ethelfrid in 613, fleeing to the north.\n\nNennius was traditionally credited with having written the \"Historia Brittonum\" c. 830. The \"Historia Brittonum\" was highly influential, becoming a major contributor to the Arthurian legend, in particular for its inclusion of events relevant to debate about the historicity of King Arthur. It also includes the legendary origins of the Picts, Scots, St. Germanus and Vortigern, and documents events associated with the Anglo-Saxon invasion of the 7th century as contributed by a Northumbrian document.\n\nEvidence suggests that this medieval literature was a compilation of several sources, some of which are named by Nennius while others are not. Some experts say that this was not the first compiled history of the Britons and that it was largely based on Gildas' \"De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae\" written some two centuries before. Scholarship indicates that other sources included a \"Life of St Germanus\" and a number of royal pedigrees. Most other sources have not survived and therefore cannot be confirmed. The surviving manuscripts of the \"Historia Brittonum\" appear to be redacted from several lost versions: information about Nennius contained in the \"Prologue\" and in the \"Apology\" differs, the \"Prologue\" containing an expanded form of the \"Apology\" that is only found in editions copied during the 12th century, leading experts to believe that later versions of the document were altered. The largest known edition contains seventy-six sections including the \"Prologue\" and the \"Apology\". The work was translated into Irish by Giolla Coemgin in c. 1071 and is the earliest example of the original \"Historia Brittonum\", but includes the author’s name, Nennius.\n\nOriginally written as a history of the Britons in an attempt to document a legitimate past, the \"Historia Brittonum\" contains stories of legend and superstition alike. The historical accuracy of the \"Historia Brittonum\" is at best questionable, but the document is internally consistent and provides information from and indirectly about Nennius' sources. Some historians argue that the \"Historia Brittonum\" gives good insight into the way 9th century Britons viewed themselves and their past. Nennius makes several attempts to trace the history of the Britons back to the Romans and Celts through his empirical observations of what he refers to as \"The Marvels\" or \"Wonders of Britain\". These include ruins, landmarks and other aspects of the British countryside that Nennius deems worthy of documentation. His explanation of the physical landmarks and ruins take on a very mystical interpretation despite Nennius being a Christian monk. Within the writing of Nennius is a sense of nationalist pride attempting to legitimise the people of Britain and embellish the past through legend much as the Romans used the story of \"Romulus and Remus\" to legitimise the founding of Rome. One such example of Nennius stressing legend is in his accounts of Arthur and his twelve battles. The \"Historia Brittonum\" would come to be the basis on which later medieval authors such as Geoffrey of Monmouth would write the \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", one of the early Welsh chronicles and romantic histories of King Arthur. .\n\nThe Prologue, in which Nennius introduces his purpose and means for writing the \"British History\", first appears in a manuscript from the twelfth century. The prologues of all other manuscripts, though only included marginally, so closely resemble this first prologue that William Newell claims they must be copies. \"The preface has evidently been prepared by some one who had before him the completed text of the treatise. It appears in the first instance as a marginal gloss contained in a MS. of the twelfth century;' under ordinary conditions, the chapter would unhesitatingly be set aside as a forgery.\" He counters Zimmer's argument by reasoning that the Irishman responsible for the \"superior\" Irish translations might have added his own touches, further claiming that if a Latin version of the \"Historia\" had been available in the 12th century, it would have been replicated in that language, not translated.\n\nDavid N. Dumville argues that the manuscript tradition and nature of the Prologue in particular fail to substantiate the claim that Nennius authored \"Historia Brittonum\". In his argument against Zimmer, he cites a textual inconsistency in the Irish translation regarding a place called Beulan, concluding that \"we must admit to ignorance of the name of [the \"Historia\"'s] ninth-century author.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The purpose of this shift is to create global supremacy and promote a free capitalist system.\n\nCentral ideas of neoliberalism have been advanced to create policies and practices to achieve global governance. New constitutionalism provides power to the private realm and limits power of state governance and public corporations. The transferring of power creates an informal self-regulatory setting allowing for the dismissal of public scrutiny and transparency. New constitutionalism has reshaped the structure of control to allow “locking in” mechanisms to occur to prevent intervention from the democratic realm and to enhance economic objectives. This protects markets from regional interference and allows global influence in order to promote imperialism.\n\nThe development of new constitutionalism is the result of globalization and the growing need for global hegemony. Institutions have gained power in regards to trade, mobility, and flexibility through the framework of new constitutionalism. The World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the European Union are all actors contributing to the power of global supremacy.\n\nNew constitutionalism as a political order emerged in the latter half of the 20th century and the term was coined by academicStephen Gill. The need for economic constitutional change was the result of crisis in political order correspondingly to the Russian Revolution and the Cold War as well as the progress of globalization through technological means. Since then the disciplinary has grown in acceptance due to the global financial crisis of 2007 and the need for largescale stabilization in its aftermath. Theorists have subsequently developed the social and economic practices both in support and disagreement of the framework to provide a comparative outlook.\n\nNew constitutionalism formed in the 1980s as the result of a growing world order and the “worldwide market revolution.” The end of the Cold War represented an ideological shift and the need for transformation. This shift was reiterated by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declaring the depletion of socialism and the rise of conservatism and liberalism. As society progressed it allowed for the evolution of capital mobility, transnational corporation and the expansion of the world market. The Great Depression and the aftermath of World War II reflected the need for reform. Reform would redirect economic and political practices, ensuring benefits for all through the creation of global institutions.\n\nNeo-liberal supremacy through the dominance of the United States and the Soviet Union allowed for geopolitical reconfiguration increasing the need for new political order. Additionally the lack of consistency among nation-state principles and the constant interruption from democratic power influenced the need to provide sustainable long term economic goals by limiting executive and legislative branches of government using constitutional framework. New constitutionalism has become prominent in the aftermath of the 2007 global financial crisis as a result of the need to bypass formal trade rules and democratic controls.\n\nThere are four main policies to define new constitutionalism. The first represents the development of a constitutional structure for the global market that dictates the public, private and international powers. These international economic agreements or “constitutions” resemble political constitutions and thus ensure sovereignty. The economic power is being shifted from the national to the international as well as from the public to the private to provide growth and sustainability.\n\nSecond is the separation of economic policies from domestic influence. This allows for capitalist markets to grow as well as extending the commodity form and the market forces. This separation insulates economic policies from governing regulatory powers as well as the public demand for transparency. Economic liberation is usually accompanied by political backlash, by disconnecting these two dynamisms suppresses democratic involvement. The World Bank advocates for the restriction of democratic participation and limitations imposed in the economic realm by creating a hierarchical system of representation.\n\nThirdly is creating “locking in” mechanisms which incorporate; laws, rules, regulations, procedures and institutions. This mechanism puts limitations on legislative and policy autonomy. Agreements are formulated to “lock in” neoliberal content through legal guarantees and sanctions. These agreements are difficult, even impossible to change which makes economic policies autonomous.\n\nLastly this process diminished the need for formal accountability. New constitutionalism has created a flexible system giving privileges to international corporations and private entities creating a “double” legal standard. This concept diminished the “watchdog” and gives the flexibility for self-regulation. This instrument is based on the international gold standard of the nineteenth century which gave rights to investor to avoid certain jurisdictions. Permitting deregulation of financial services and trade investment avoids popular pressures and limits the need for transparency. Minimizing liability and ensuring private authority the economic sector becomes more efficient, functional and practical.\n\nAt the global and regional level institutions are implementing the new constitutionalism framework to advance global governance by upholding the rights of private corporations and promoting a free capitalist society. These institutions policies will ensure economic growth at the global level.\n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) is a prominent figure in governing the global economy. Formally it was the responsibility of General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade built on neoliberal principles but lacked the greater power adapted through new constitutionalism. The World Trade Organization represents a governing global entity which has adapted to the principles of new constitutionalism. The WTO main purpose is to limit national interference in the global market and challenge any nation-state regulations that could be detrimental to the economy. Any economic alternatives that are proposed by nations can be discredited by the WTO as well as restricting governments ability to implement policy in international jurisdiction. The WTO represents the freedom of markets and allowing investors to capitalize in a world economy, by doing so provides protection to the private sector. Stephen McBride describes the World Trade Organization as having “quasi-judicial and quasi-constitutional aura.” The judicial and constitutional supremacy highlights the difficulty in challenging the organizations because of lock in mechanisms.\n\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a considered a regional governing entity that encompasses the principles of new constitutionalism. President Ronald Regan referred to the North American Free Trade Agreement as a “new economic constitution.” Constitution because the agreement provided restrictions on government intrusion, rights to certain actors and enforcement mechanisms. The binding agreement afforded rights to both foreign and domestic investor to protect the interests of private capital and corporations. By limiting government powers the agreement locked in private interests and reduced governments ability to expand or restore public services in free trade.\n\nFocus at the global level has resulted in hostility between the public and private realms within nation states. This hostility creates a political struggle between the private sector who safeguard the rights of capital and the public who want to control capitalism politically, democracy and socially. The control is being denationalized and delocalized causing negative repercussions at state level. New constitutionalism lacks political will and can have detrimental effects to global dignity and future generations. Dividing economic policies from domestic creates disturbances within the civil society. Human rights, environmental concerns and public services are being devalued because of the lack of economic concern.\n\nNew constitutionalism favours the elitists providing preferential treatment and widening the social gap. International financial institutions, investors and bond-raters are holding higher positions of authority than governments or nation-states furthering global supremacy. There is an urgent need for surveillance, policy making power, regulations and transparency economic outcomes are not solely focused on monetary gain but humanitarian concerns as well. The absence of accountability and democratic authority has led many countries to depart from the constitutional framework and reclaim their sovereignty as independent nations. Australia has begun to constrain the advancements of new constitutionalism while many South America states have begun to exit the global regime completely. Canada and the United States have begun to form provisions to improve the democratic power within the global order and no longer allow for their governments to be immobilized.\n"}

Other proposed scenarios include captured body, fission, formed together (condensation theory), planetesimal collisions (formed from asteroid-like bodies), and collision theories.\n\nThe standard giant-impact hypothesis suggests the Mars-sized body, called Theia, impacted Earth, creating a large debris ring around Earth, which then accreted to form the Moon. This collision also resulted in the 23.5° tilted axis of the earth, thus causing the seasons. The Moon's oxygen isotopic ratios seem to be essentially identical to Earth's. Oxygen isotopic ratios, which may be measured very precisely, yield a unique and distinct signature for each solar system body. If Theia had been a separate protoplanet, it probably would have had a different oxygen isotopic signature from Earth, as would the ejected mixed material. Also, the Moon's titanium isotope ratio (Ti/Ti) appears so close to the Earth's (within 4 ppm) that little if any of the colliding body's mass could likely have been part of the Moon.\n\nSome theories have been stated that presume the Earth had no large moons early in the formation of the Solar System, 4.6 billion years ago, Earth being basically rock and lava. Theia, an early protoplanet the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of this ejecta escaped into space, but the rest consolidated into a single body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.\n\nThe hypothesis requires a collision between a body about 90% of the present size of Earth, and another the diameter of Mars (half of the terrestrial radius and a tenth of its mass). The colliding body has sometimes been referred to as Theia, the mother of Selene, the Moon goddess in Greek mythology. This size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient angular momentum to match the current orbital configuration. Such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around Earth to have eventually accumulated to form the Moon.\n\nComputer simulations show a need for a glancing blow, which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off. The asymmetrical shape of the Earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass. The energy involved in this collision is impressive: possibly trillions of tons of material would have been vaporized and melted. In parts of the Earth, the temperature would have risen to 10,000 °C (18,000 °F).\n\nThe Moon's relatively small iron core is explained by Theia's core accreting into that of Earth. The lack of volatiles in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision. The energy liberated during the reaccreation of material in orbit around Earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the Moon, leading to the generation of a magma ocean.\n\nThe newly formed Moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today, and spiraled outward because of tidal friction transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the Moon's orbital motion. Along the way, the Moon's rotation became tidally locked to Earth, so that one side of the Moon continually faces toward Earth. Also, the Moon would have collided with and incorporated any small pre-existing satellites of Earth, which would have shared the Earth's composition, including isotopic abundances. The geology of the Moon has since been more independent of the Earth. Although this hypothesis explains many aspects of the Earth–Moon system, there are still a few unresolved problems, such as the Moon's volatile elements not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact.\n\nAnother issue is lunar and Earth isotope comparisons. In 2001, the most precise measurement yet of the isotopic signatures of moon rocks was published. Surprisingly, the Apollo lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to Earth rocks, but different from other Solar system bodies. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from Caltech showed that the likelihood of Theia having an identical isotopic signature as the Earth is very small (<1 percent). Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth, which conflicts with the Moon forming far from Earth's orbit.\n\nTo help resolve these problems, a new theory published in 2012 posits that two bodies—each five times the size of Mars—collided, then re-collided, forming a large disc of debris that eventually formed Earth and the Moon. The paper was called “Forming a Moon with an Earth-like composition via a Giant Impact,” by R.M Canup.\n\nA 2012 study on the depletion of zinc isotopes on the Moon supported the giant-impact origin for Earth and the Moon.\n\nIn 2013, a study was released that indicated that water in lunar magma is indistinguishable from carbonaceous chondrites and nearly the same as that of Earth in isotopic composition.\n\nThe giant-impact hypothesis was again challenged in September 2013, with a growing sense that lunar origins are more complicated.\n\nIn 2018 researchers at Harvard and the University of California developed computer models demonstrating that one possible outcome of a planetary collision is that it creates a synestia, a mass of vaporized rock and metal which form a torus extending beyond the lunar orbit. The synestia will eventually shrink and cool to create the satellite and reform the impacted planet.\n\nAnother possibility is that before the giant impact, Earth had one or more normal satellites that shared its composition. Following the impact, the Moon formed closer to Earth than these satellites, and then spiraled outward, colliding with them. (If the Moon was more massive than the other satellites, its tidal effect on Earth would have been greater, making it spiral outward faster.) This led to the Moon being covered with material with the same composition as the satellites, and so Earth.\n\nIn 2017, planetary researchers at Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel offered a new theory that suggests the moon was forged in a brutal rain of cosmic debris that repeatedly hammered the fledgling Earth over millions of years. They determined that a series of smaller impacts, which were likely more common in the early solar system, could blast enough Earth rocks and dirt into orbit to form a small moonlet. As repeated impacts created more balls of debris, the moonlets could merge over time into one large moon.\n\nThis hypothesis states that the Moon was captured by the Earth. This was popular until the 1980s, and some things in favor of this model include the Moon's size, orbit, and tidal locking.\n\nOne problem is understanding the capture mechanism. A close encounter with Earth typically results in either collision or altered trajectories. For this hypothesis to function, there might have been a large atmosphere around the primitive Earth, which would slow the movement of the Moon by natural aerobraking before it could escape. That hypothesis may also explain the irregular satellite orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This hypothesis also has difficulty explaining the essentially identical oxygen isotope ratios of the two bodies.\n\nThis is the now discredited hypothesis that an ancient, rapidly spinning Earth expelled a piece of its mass. This was proposed by George Darwin (son of the famous biologist Charles Darwin) in the 1800s and retained some popularity until Apollo. The Austrian geologist Otto Ampherer in 1925 also suggested the emerging of the Moon as cause for continental drift.\n\nIt was proposed that the Pacific Ocean represented the scar of this event. Today it is known that the oceanic crust that makes up this ocean basin is relatively young, about 200 million years old or less, whereas the Moon is much older. The Moon does not consist of oceanic crust but of mantle material, which originated inside the proto-Earth in the Precambrian.\n\nThe hypothesis of accretion suggests that the Earth and the Moon formed together as a double system from the primordial accretion disk of the Solar System.\nThe problem with this hypothesis is that it does not explain the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system or why the Moon has a relatively small iron core compared to the Earth (25% of its radius compared to 50% for the Earth).\n\nIn 2011, it was theorized that a second moon existed 4.5 billion years ago, and later had an impact with the Moon, as a part of the accretion process in the formation of the Moon.\n\nOne hypothesis, presented only as a possibility, was that the Earth took the Moon from Venus.\n\nUranium–lead dating of Apollo 14 zircon fragments shows the age of the moon to be about 4.51 billion years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23734", "title": "Petrarch", "text": "Petrarch\n\nFrancesco Petrarca (; July 20, 1304 – July 18/19, 1374), commonly anglicized as Petrarch (), was a scholar and poet of Renaissance Italy who was one of the earliest humanists. His rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often credited with initiating the 14th-century Renaissance. Petrarch is often considered the founder of Humanism. In the 16th century, Pietro Bembo created the model for the modern Italian language based on Petrarch's works, as well as those of Giovanni Boccaccio, and, to a lesser extent, Dante Alighieri. Petrarch would be later endorsed as a model for Italian style by the Accademia della Crusca.\n\nPetrarch's sonnets were admired and imitated throughout Europe during the Renaissance and became a model for lyrical poetry. He is also known for being the first to develop the concept of the \"Dark Ages.\"\n\nPetrarch was born in the Tuscan city of Arezzo in 1304. He was the son of Ser Petracco and his wife Eletta Canigiani. His given name was \"Francesco Petracco.\" The name was Latinized to \"Petrarca.\" Petrarch's younger brother was born in Incisa in Val d'Arno in 1307. Dante was a friend of his father.\n\nPetrarch spent his early childhood in the village of Incisa, near Florence. He spent much of his early life at Avignon and nearby Carpentras, where his family moved to follow Pope Clement V who moved there in 1309 to begin the Avignon Papacy. He studied law at the University of Montpellier (1316–20) and Bologna (1320–23) with a lifelong friend and schoolmate called Guido Sette. Because his father was in the profession of law, he insisted that Petrarch and his brother study law also. Petrarch however, was primarily interested in writing and Latin literature and considered these seven years wasted. Additionally, he proclaimed that through legal manipulation his guardians robbed him of his small property inheritance in Florence, which only reinforced his dislike for the legal system. He protested, \"I couldn't face making a merchandise of my mind,\" as he viewed the legal system as the art of selling justice.\n\nPetrarch was a prolific letter writer and counted Boccaccio among his notable friends to whom he wrote often. After the death of their parents, Petrarch and his brother Gherardo went back to Avignon in 1326, where he worked in numerous clerical offices. This work gave him much time to devote to his writing. With his first large-scale work, \"Africa\", an epic in Latin about the great Roman general Scipio Africanus, Petrarch emerged as a European celebrity. On April 8, 1341, he became the second poet laureate since antiquity and was crowned by Roman \"Senatori\" Giordano Orsini and Orso dell'Anguillara on the holy grounds of Rome's Capitol.\n\nHe traveled widely in Europe, served as an ambassador, and has been called \"the first tourist\" because he traveled just for pleasure, and the reason he climbed Mont Ventoux. During his travels, he collected crumbling Latin manuscripts and was a prime mover in the recovery of knowledge from writers of Rome and Greece. He encouraged and advised Leontius Pilatus's translation of Homer from a manuscript purchased by Boccaccio, although he was severely critical of the result. Petrarch had acquired a copy, which he did not entrust to Leontius, but he knew no Greek; Homer, Petrarch said, \"was dumb to him, while he was deaf to Homer\". In 1345 he personally discovered a collection of Cicero's letters not previously known to have existed, the collection \"Epistulae ad Atticum\", in the Chapter Library (\"Biblioteca Capitolare\") of Verona Cathedral.\n\nDisdaining what he believed to be the ignorance of the centuries preceding the era in which he lived, Petrarch is credited or charged with creating the concept of a historical \"Dark Ages\".\n\nPetrarch recounts that on April 26, 1336, with his brother and two servants, he climbed to the top of Mont Ventoux (, a feat which he undertook for recreation rather than necessity. The exploit is described in a celebrated letter addressed to his friend and confessor, the monk Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro, composed some time after the fact. In it, Petrarch claimed to have been inspired by Philip V of Macedon's ascent of Mount Haemo and that an aged peasant had told him that nobody had ascended Ventoux before or after himself, 50 years before, and warned him against attempting to do so. The nineteenth-century Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt noted that Jean Buridan had climbed the same mountain a few years before, and ascents accomplished during the Middle Ages have been recorded, including that of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne.\n\nScholars note that Petrarch's letter to Dionigi displays a strikingly \"modern\" attitude of aesthetic gratification in the grandeur of the scenery and is still often cited in books and journals devoted to the sport of mountaineering. In Petrarch, this attitude is coupled with an aspiration for a virtuous Christian life, and on reaching the summit, he took from his pocket a volume by his beloved mentor, Saint Augustine, that he always carried with him.\nFor pleasure alone he climbed Mont Ventoux, which rises to more than six thousand feet, beyond Vaucluse. It was no great feat, of course; but he was the first recorded Alpinist of modern times, the first to climb a mountain merely for the delight of looking from its top. (Or almost the first; for in a high pasture he met an old shepherd, who said that fifty years before he had attained the summit, and had got nothing from it save toil and repentance and torn clothing.) Petrarch was dazed and stirred by the view of the Alps, the mountains around Lyons, the Rhone, the Bay of Marseilles. He took Augustine's \"Confessions\" from his pocket and reflected that his climb was merely an allegory of aspiration toward a better life.\nAs the book fell open, Petrarch's eyes were immediately drawn to the following words:\nPetrarch's response was to turn from the outer world of nature to the inner world of \"soul\":\n\nJames Hillman argues that this rediscovery of the inner world is the real significance of the Ventoux event. The Renaissance begins not with the ascent of Mont Ventoux but with the subsequent descent—the \"return [...] to the valley of soul\", as Hillman puts it. Arguing against such a singular and hyperbolic periodization, Paul James suggests a different reading:\n\nPetrarch spent the later part of his life journeying through northern Italy as an international scholar and poet-diplomat. His career in the Church did not allow him to marry, but he is believed to have fathered two children by a woman or women unknown to posterity. A son, Giovanni, was born in 1337, and a daughter, Francesca, was born in 1343. Both he later legitimized.\nGiovanni died of the plague in 1361. In the same year Petrarch was named canon in Monselice near Padua. Francesca married Francescuolo da Brossano (who was later named executor of Petrarch's will) that same year. In 1362, shortly after the birth of a daughter, Eletta (the same name as Petrarch's mother), they joined Petrarch in Venice to flee the plague then ravaging parts of Europe. A second grandchild, Francesco, was born in 1366, but died before his second birthday. Francesca and her family lived with Petrarch in Venice for five years from 1362 to 1367 at Palazzo Molina; although Petrarch continued to travel in those years. Between 1361 and 1369 the younger Boccaccio paid the older Petrarch two visits. The first was in Venice, the second was in Padua.\n\nAbout 1368 Petrarch and his daughter Francesca (with her family) moved to the small town of Arquà in the Euganean Hills near Padua, where he passed his remaining years in religious contemplation. He died in his house in Arquà early on July 20, 1374 – his seventieth birthday. The house hosts now a permanent exhibition of Petrarchian works and curiosities; among others you find the famous tomb of Petrarch's beloved cat who was embalmed. On the marble slab there is a Latin inscription written by Antonio Quarenghi:\nPetrarch's will (dated April 4, 1370) leaves 50 florins to Boccaccio \"to buy a warm winter dressing gown\"; various legacies (a horse, a silver cup, a lute, a Madonna) to his brother and his friends; his house in Vaucluse to its caretaker; for his soul, and for the poor; and the bulk of his estate to his son-in-law, Francescuolo da Brossano, who is to give half of it to \"the person to whom, as he knows, I wish it to go\"; presumably his daughter, Francesca, Brossano's wife. The will mentions neither the property in Arquà nor his library; Petrarch's library of notable manuscripts was already promised to Venice, in exchange for the Palazzo Molina. This arrangement was probably cancelled when he moved to Padua, the enemy of Venice, in 1368. The library was seized by the lords of Padua, and his books and manuscripts are now widely scattered over Europe. Nevertheless, the Biblioteca Marciana traditionally claimed this bequest as its founding, although it was in fact founded by Cardinal Bessarion in 1468.\n\nPetrarch is best known for his Italian poetry, notably the \"Canzoniere\" (\"Songbook\") and the \"Trionfi\" (\"Triumphs\"). However, Petrarch was an enthusiastic Latin scholar and did most of his writing in this language. His Latin writings include scholarly works, introspective essays, letters, and more poetry. Among them are \"Secretum Meum\" (\"My Secret Book\"), an intensely personal, guilt-ridden imaginary dialogue with Augustine of Hippo; \"De Viris Illustribus\" (\"On Famous Men\"), a series of moral biographies; \"Rerum Memorandarum Libri\", an incomplete treatise on the cardinal virtues; \"De Otio Religiosorum\" (\"On Religious Leisure\") and \"De Vita Solitaria\" (\"On the Solitary Life\"), which praise the contemplative life; \"De Remediis Utriusque Fortunae\" (\"Remedies for Fortune Fair and Foul\"), a self-help book which remained popular for hundreds of years; \"Itinerarium\" (\"Petrarch's Guide to the Holy Land\"); invectives against opponents such as doctors, scholastics, and the French; the \"Carmen Bucolicum\", a collection of 12 pastoral poems; and the unfinished epic \"Africa\". He translated seven psalms, a collection known as the \"Penitential Psalms\".\n\nPetrarch also published many volumes of his letters, including a few written to his long-dead friends from history such as Cicero and Virgil. Cicero, Virgil, and Seneca were his literary models. Most of his Latin writings are difficult to find today, but several of his works are available in English translations. Several of his Latin works are scheduled to appear in the Harvard University Press series \"I Tatti\". It is difficult to assign any precise dates to his writings because he tended to revise them throughout his life.\n\nPetrarch collected his letters into two major sets of books called \"Epistolae familiares\" (\"Letters on Familiar Matters\") and \"Seniles\" (\"Letters of Old Age\"), both of which are available in English translation. The plan for his letters was suggested to him by knowledge of Cicero's letters. These were published \"without names\" to protect the recipients, all of whom had close relationships to Petrarch. The recipients of these letters included Philippe de Cabassoles, bishop of Cavaillon; Ildebrandino Conti, bishop of Padua; Cola di Rienzo, tribune of Rome; Francesco Nelli, priest of the Prior of the Church of the Holy Apostles in Florence; and Niccolò di Capoccia, a cardinal and priest of Saint Vitalis. His \"Letter to Posterity\" (the last letter in \"Seniles\") gives an autobiography and a synopsis of his philosophy in life. It was originally written in Latin and was completed in 1371 or 1372 - the first such autobiography in a thousand years (since Saint Augustine).\n\nWhile Petrarch's poetry was set to music frequently after his death, especially by Italian madrigal composers of the Renaissance in the 16th century, only one musical setting composed during Petrarch's lifetime survives. This is \"Non al suo amante\" by Jacopo da Bologna, written around 1350.\n\nOn April 6, 1327, after Petrarch gave up his vocation as a priest, the sight of a woman called \"Laura\" in the church of Sainte-Claire d'Avignon awoke in him a lasting passion, celebrated in the \"Rime sparse\" (\"Scattered rhymes\"). Later, Renaissance poets who copied Petrarch's style named this collection of 366 poems \"Il Canzoniere\" (\"Song Book\"). Laura may have been Laura de Noves, the wife of Count Hugues de Sade (an ancestor of the Marquis de Sade). There is little definite information in Petrarch's work concerning Laura, except that she is lovely to look at, fair-haired, with a modest, dignified bearing. Laura and Petrarch had little or no personal contact. According to his \"Secretum\", she refused him because she was already married. He channeled his feelings into love poems that were exclamatory rather than persuasive, and wrote prose that showed his contempt for men who pursue women. Upon her death in 1348, the poet found that his grief was as difficult to live with as was his former despair. Later in his \"Letter to Posterity\", Petrarch wrote: \"In my younger days I struggled constantly with an overwhelming but pure love affair – my only one, and I would have struggled with it longer had not premature death, bitter but salutary for me, extinguished the cooling flames. I certainly wish I could say that I have always been entirely free from desires of the flesh, but I would be lying if I did\".\nWhile it is possible she was an idealized or pseudonymous character – particularly since the name \"Laura\" has a linguistic connection to the poetic \"laurels\" Petrarch coveted – Petrarch himself always denied it. His frequent use of \"l'aura\" is also remarkable: for example, the line \"Erano i capei d'oro a \"l'aura\" sparsi\" may both mean \"her hair was all over Laura's body\", and \"the wind (\"l'aura\") blew through her hair\". There is psychological realism in the description of Laura, although Petrarch draws heavily on conventionalised descriptions of love and lovers from troubadour songs and other literature of courtly love. Her presence causes him unspeakable joy, but his unrequited love creates unendurable desires, inner conflicts between the ardent lover and the mystic Christian, making it impossible to reconcile the two. Petrarch's quest for love leads to hopelessness and irreconcilable anguish, as he expresses in the series of paradoxes in Rima 134 \"Pace non trovo, et non ò da far guerra;/e temo, et spero; et ardo, et son un ghiaccio\": \"I find no peace, and yet I make no war:/and fear, and hope: and burn, and I am ice\".\n\nLaura is unreachable – the few physical descriptions of her are vague, almost impalpable as the love he pines for, and such is perhaps the power of his verse, which lives off the melodies it evokes against the fading, diaphanous image that is no more consistent than a ghost. Francesco De Sanctis remarks much the same thing in his \"Storia della letteratura italiana\", and contemporary critics agree on the powerful music of his verse. Perhaps the poet was inspired by a famous singer he met in Veneto around the 1350s. Gianfranco Contini, in a famous essay on Petrarch's language (\"Preliminari sulla lingua del Petrarca\". Petrarca, Canzoniere. Turin, Einaudi, 1964) has spoken of linguistic indeterminacy – Petrarch never rises above the \"bel pié\" (her lovely foot): Laura is too holy to be painted; she is an awe-inspiring goddess. Sensuality and passion are suggested rather by the rhythm and music that shape the vague contours of the lady. In addition, some today consider Laura to be a representation of an \"ideal Renaissance woman\", based on her nature and definitive characteristics.\n\nPetrarch is a world apart from Dante and his \"Divina Commedia\". In spite of the metaphysical subject, the \"Commedia\" is deeply rooted in the cultural and social milieu of turn-of-the-century Florence: Dante's rise to power (1300) and exile (1302), his political passions call for a \"violent\" use of language, where he uses all the registers, from low and trivial to sublime and philosophical. Petrarch confessed to Boccaccio that he had never read the \"Commedia\", remarks Contini, wondering whether this was true or Petrarch wanted to distance himself from Dante. Dante's language evolves as he grows old, from the courtly love of his early stilnovistic \"Rime\" and \"Vita nuova\" to the \"Convivio\" and \"Divina Commedia\", where Beatrice is sanctified as the goddess of philosophy – the philosophy announced by the Donna Gentile at the death of Beatrice.\n\nIn contrast, Petrarch's thought and style are relatively uniform throughout his life – he spent much of it revising the songs and sonnets of the \"Canzoniere\" rather than moving to new subjects or poetry. Here, poetry alone provides a consolation for personal grief, much less philosophy or politics (as in Dante), for Petrarch fights within himself (sensuality versus mysticism, profane versus Christian literature), not against anything outside of himself. The strong moral and political convictions which had inspired Dante belong to the Middle Ages and the libertarian spirit of the commune; Petrarch's moral dilemmas, his refusal to take a stand in politics, his reclusive life point to a different direction, or time. The free commune, the place that had made Dante an eminent politician and scholar, was being dismantled: the \"signoria\" was taking its place. Humanism and its spirit of empirical inquiry, however, were making progress – but the papacy (especially after Avignon) and the empire (Henry VII, the last hope of the white Guelphs, died near Siena in 1313) had lost much of their original prestige.\n\nPetrarch polished and perfected the sonnet form inherited from Giacomo da Lentini and which Dante widely used in his \"Vita nuova\" to popularise the new courtly love of the \"Dolce Stil Novo\". The tercet benefits from Dante's terza rima (compare the \"Divina Commedia\"), the quatrains prefer the ABBA-ABBA to the ABAB-ABAB scheme of the Sicilians. The imperfect rhymes of \"u\" with closed \"o\" and \"i\" with closed \"e\" (inherited from Guittone's mistaken rendering of Sicilian verse) are excluded, but the rhyme of open and closed \"o\" is kept. Finally, Petrarch's enjambment creates longer semantic units by connecting one line to the following. The vast majority (317) of Petrarch's 366 poems collected in the \"Canzoniere\" (dedicated to Laura) were \"sonnets\", and the Petrarchan sonnet still bears his name.\n\nPetrarch is traditionally called the father of Humanism and considered by many to be the \"father of the Renaissance.\" In his work \"Secretum meum\" he points out that secular achievements did not necessarily preclude an authentic relationship with God. Petrarch argued instead that God had given humans their vast intellectual and creative potential to be used to their fullest. He inspired humanist philosophy which led to the intellectual flowering of the Renaissance. He believed in the immense moral and practical value of the study of ancient history and literature – that is, the study of human thought and action. Petrarch was a devout Catholic and did not see a conflict between realizing humanity's potential and having religious faith.\n\nA highly introspective man, he shaped the nascent humanist movement a great deal because many of the internal conflicts and musings expressed in his writings were seized upon by Renaissance humanist philosophers and argued continually for the next 200 years. For example, Petrarch struggled with the proper relation between the active and contemplative life, and tended to emphasize the importance of solitude and study. In a clear disagreement with Dante, in 1346 Petrarch argued in his \"De vita solitaria\" that Pope Celestine V's refusal of the papacy in 1294 was as a virtuous example of solitary life. Later the politician and thinker Leonardo Bruni (1370-1444) argued for the active life, or \"civic humanism\". As a result, a number of political, military, and religious leaders during the Renaissance were inculcated with the notion that their pursuit of personal fulfillment should be grounded in classical example and philosophical contemplation.\n\nPetrarch's influence is evident in the works of Serafino Ciminelli from Aquila (1466-1500) and in the works of Marin Držić (1508-1567) from Dubrovnik.\n\nThe Romantic composer Franz Liszt set three of Petrarch's Sonnets (47, 104, and 123) to music for voice, \"Tre sonetti del Petrarca\", which he later would transcribe for solo piano for inclusion in the suite \"Années de Pèlerinage\". Liszt also set a poem by Victor Hugo, \" O quand je dors\" in which Petrarch and Laura are invoked as the epitome of erotic love.\n\nWhile in Avignon in 1991, Modernist composer Elliott Carter completed his solo flute piece \"Scrivo in Vento\" which is in part inspired by and structured by Petrarch's Sonnet 212, \"Beato in sogno\". It was premiered on Petrarch's 687th birthday.\n\nIn November 2003, it was announced that pathological anatomists would be exhuming Petrarch's body from his casket in Arquà Petrarca, in order to verify 19th-century reports that he had stood 1.83 meters (about six feet), which would have been tall for his period. The team from the University of Padua also hoped to reconstruct his cranium in order to generate a computerized image of his features to coincide with his 700th birthday. The tomb had been opened previously in 1873 by Professor Giovanni Canestrini, also of Padua University. When the tomb was opened, the skull was discovered in fragments and a DNA test revealed that the skull was not Petrarch's, prompting calls for the return of Petrarch's skull.\n\nThe researchers are fairly certain that the body in the tomb is Petrarch's due to the fact that the skeleton bears evidence of injuries mentioned by Petrarch in his writings, including a kick from a donkey when he was 42.\n\n"}

{"id": "12562715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12562715", "title": "Romanian philosophy", "text": "Romanian philosophy\n\nRomanian philosophy is a name covering either a) the philosophy done in Romania or by Romanians, or b) an ethnic philosophy, which expresses at a high level the fundamental features of the Romanian spirituality, or which elevates to a philosophical level the Weltanschauung of the Romanian people, as deposited in language and folklore, traditions, architecture and other linguistic and cultural artifacts.\n\nThe discussion concerning the existence of a Romanian philosophy has known three stages.\n\nBetween the two World Wars, after the emergence of Greater Romania, Romanian national identity went through a crisis. Since it was not centered anymore on immediate political goals (national rights, independence, national unity etc.), the idea now had a more pronounced cultural character. Therefore, discussions of \"national specificity\" in historiography, literature and philosophy became very common. The first history of Romanian philosophy was published in 1922 by Marin Ştefănescu, proving that philosophical thinking in Romania had reached the level of self-reflexivity; in other words, it had become conscious of itself. The general conclusion of interbellum discussions, which involved almost every notable philosopher, was that there is a Romanian philosophy proper, with a distinct profile among other national philosophies. Constantin Noica, who became one of the most prominent Romanian philosophers, thought early on that Romanian philosophy is characterized by paganism, cosmicism (i.e. no acute separation of the world of the man from, transcendence) and determinism (or rather, \"fatalism\").\n\nDuring the post-1965 communism period, the existence of a specific Romanian philosophy became an uncontested dogma. The official narratives, heavily influenced by national-communist and so-called protochronistic ideology, spoke even of the \"philosophy of the Geto-Dacians\". They were affirming a continuity of philosophical vision from Dacians, via folklore, to contemporary authors. Needless to say, the \"materialistic\" character of Romanian philosophy and other pretensions of the official dogma were inexistent or wildly exaggerated. However, some important non-Marxist authors, like Noica, also insisted on the singularity of Romanian philosophical thinking. Noica even wrote a book titled \"The Romanian Sentiment of Being\".\n\nAfter the communist regime fell in 1989, this discussion resurfaced. One opinion is that there are Romanian philosophers, but there is no Romanian philosophy. In other words, the phrase \"Romanian philosophy\" has a mere historical-geographical content. The opposite point of view consists in two theses: 1) not all the European nations have their own national philosophy; 2) the Romanian nation has its own, distinctive, national philosophy, which continues at a higher level its traditional world-view. The article from the \"Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy\" concerning the philosophy in Romania seems rather to adopt a weaker version of the second position. The existence of a Romanian philosophy is recognized, but is not connected to the national ethos, nor to the ethnic substance of the Romanians. Thus, the authors say: \"At the peak of its evolution between the two world wars, Romanian philosophy had the following characteristic features: it was closely related to literature, in the sense that most Romanian philosophers were also important writers; it showed excessive preoccupation with the issue of Romanian identity; it was involved in Romania's historical, political and ideological debates, fueling attitudes in favour of or against Westernization and modernization; it synchronized quickly with Western philosophical thinking; and it was (and still is) lacking in ethical thought.\" (Marta Petreu, Mircea Flonta, Ioan Lucian Muntean, \"Romania, philosophy in\" from the \"Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", 2004)\n\nThe first broadly philosophical texts attested on the Romanian territory are the Patristic writings. Among this corpus of texts, in Church Slavonic translations, the most important are the works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite and the \"Dialectics\" of St. John Damascene . Excerpts from ancient philosophers circulated also. The only notable indigenous production of the epoch is \"The Teachings of Neagoe Basarab to his Son, Theodosius\", written around 1521. The book is a compilation of patristic and biblical sources, with many moral and political reflections, from an ascetic viewpoint. It illustrates Byzantine theocracy and proposes the model of a prince-monk.\n\nIn the middle of the 17th century, Romanian acquires the status of liturgical language alongside Greek and Slavonic, and begins to develop a philosophical vocabulary. Nicolae Milescu (1638–1708) authored the first translation of a philosophical text into Romanian (the treatise \"On the Dominant Reason\" of Pseudo-Josephus Flavius, translated towards 1688). Miron Costin (1633–1691) wrote the first philosophical poem in Romanian, \"The Life of the World\" (1672), an ethical reflection on the earthly happiness. The most important philosophical production of this century is \"The Divan\" (1698) of Dimitrie Cantemir (1673–1723), a philosophical treatise which supports the Orthodox ethics with rational arguments. This treatise was translated into Arabic for the use of the Syrian Christians, and, later, into Bulgarian.\n\nSome philosophical texts were written in Latin. Gavril Ivul (1619–1678), a Jesuit who taught philosophy in the University of Vienna, wrote a logical treatise, \"Propositiones ex universa logica\" (1654). Cantemir authored a textbook of logic and a treatise of \"theologo-physics\", \"Sacrosanctae scientiae indepingibilis imago\" (1700) which, besides discussing the nature of time, and the problem of the universals, tries to justify Biblical cosmogony with non-theological arguments drawing on the philosophy of Jan Baptist van Helmont. He left also a text on the philosophy of history, \"Monarchiarum physica examinatio\".\n\nIn the 18th century, the dominant philosophy in Moldavia and Walachia is the neo-Aristotelianism of Theophilos Corydalleus, which was in fact the Paduan neo-Aristotelianism of Zabarella, Pomponazzi and Cremonini. Towards the last quarter of the century, this was challenged by the spread of rationalism (Christian Wolff) and empiricism (John Locke). Important figures may be considered Samuel Micu (1745–1806) in Transylvania, and Iosif Moisiodax (1730–1800) in Moldavia. The first translated intensively from the Wolffian Baumeister, implicitly promoting German enlightenment. The last contributed decisively at the modernization of the philosophical curriculum in the Princely Academies. He wrote an essay called \"The Apology\", a splendid plea for modern European philosophy and against the old Aristotelian Chorydaleian scholasticism. The philosophical language of this century was mostly Greek. One notable exception is provided by the clucer Ioan Geanetu (Jean Zanetti), who published in 1787, in Greek and French, a treatise called \"Réfutation du traité d'Ocellus de la nature de l'univers\". Here he criticised an ancient conception regarding the eternity of the universe, in order to reinforce the faith of his correligionaries.\n\nThe 19th century can be divided from the point of view of a history of philosophy into three periods: that of the final days of the Phanariote regime, that of the restoration of the Romanian dynasties and, finally, that of Charles I, who came from a foreign dynasty (Hohenzollern).\n\nIn the first two decades of the 19th century the most prominent philosophers in the Romanian Principalities are still the Greek professors of the Princely Academies. Among them, we can mention Lambros Photiades, Konstantinos Vardalachos, Neophyte Doucas and Benjamin Lesvios in Bucharest, as well as Daniel Philippidis, Stephanos Doungas and Dimitrios Panayotou Govdelas in Iaşi. Some of them were alumni of the Academies from the Principalities, as Vardalachos, who studied with Photiades, himself an ancient student of the Princely Academy from Bucharest. Daniel Philippidis also studied at this Academy in the 1780s, under the famous philologist Neophyte Cavsocalyvitis. But they had studied also (with the exception of Photiades) in major Western universities. Doungas, for example, was a student of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. In his \"Physics\" he tried to reconcile the dogmatic Orthodox theology with the science of nature, following Schelling's system.\n\nThey were not only proponents of modern philosophy and natural sciences, but also of Enlightenment ideas. The philosophy of the French \"philosophes\" had thus a major impact on the Romanian intelligentsia through their courses and published books. Philosophically, the most interesting of these authors is Beniamin Lesvios, whose \"Metaphysics\" contains, among other valuable things, a theory of perception involving the discussion of the conceptual possibility of colour-inversion. Also, it is worth mentioning that Philippides is the first follower of Kant in the Romanian Principalities.\n\nAfter 1821, the ruling Princes will be once again elected by local noblemen i.e. the boyars (and validated by the Sultan). The Greek will be replaced in the Academies with the Romanian. It is an era of exalted patriotism and de-hellenization of Romanian culture and habits. Romanians begin to go directly to Western sources and to practice philosophy in their own language.\nAs early as 1818 the Transylvanian Gheorghe Lazăr (1779–1821), who studied in Vienna, began teaching philosophy in Romanian in the Greek-speaking Academy. We do not have any of his courses left, but we know that he was a follower of Kant. It is debatable whether he had first-hand knowledge of Kant or not. We know that for didactical purposes he decided to make a Romanian translation of some of Krug's works, which he subsequently used as a textbook. Krug's \"Handbook of Philosophy and Philosophical Literature\" will be translated in the first period of the 19th century another three times, by August Treboniu Laurian (1810–1881), Timotei Cipariu (1805–1887) and Simeon Barnutiu (1808–1864). They were all Transylvanian, and they all studied in Vienna. Cipariu was a teacher of philosophy in the Romanian College from Blaj, where he taught using Krug's works in the 1828's. As such, philosophical criticism was mainly a Transylvanian specialty.\nAn important philosopher of this period is Eufrosin Poteca (1786–1858). He studied in the Princely Academy from Bucharest with Vardalachos, Doukas and Lesvios and at the universities of Pisa and Paris (1820–1825). Eufrosin Poteca taught philosophy at the Saint Sava Academy, and was a prolific translator of philosophical and theological works. His own philosophy was strongly influenced by the Sensualism of Condillac, de Tracy and Soave, by Rousseau's political philosophy and by his strong Christian beliefs. He maintained that there are three metaphysical first principles, body, soul and spirit, studied by three distinct sciences: physics (the study of unanimated bodies), psychology (the study of animated things) and ideology (in the sense of de Tracy, the science of ideas). The whole universe displays this triadic structure, as it is permeated by matter, life and logos. He identified the laws of nature with the laws of God, and he drew from this conception many moral conclusions, e.g. the lack of foundation of celibacy. Also, he thought that the foundation of all morals, politics and rights is the golden rule. From here he argued against slavery, and that got him exiled to a remote monastery, where he lived until the end of his life.\n\nAnother important name is that of Ionică Tăutul (1798–1828), a Moldavian boyar. He was educated at home by some French refugees, acquiring an extensive knowledge of political philosophy. Indeed, he quotes Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Voltaire, but also obscure writers such as Sabatier de Castre. His ideas are disseminated mostly in his correspondence and political pamphlets. But he left also some interesting works, like a \"Construction of Politics according to Human Nature\" or an \"Essay against Deists and Materialists\". His intention was to build a political theory starting from a Christian anthropology of the state of nature. The political system to be justified by such a procedure was an \"aristo-democratic republic\". The second essay, whose title is obviously inspired by Mersenne, criticises the materialist vision of the man-machine (La Mettrie) on the bases of a rather Paulinic doctrine of the \"amphibian\" character of man, character which clearly distinguishes him from the natural world.\n\nAn important philosopher is also Alexandru Hâjdeu (1811–1872), a student of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling in Berlin. This man, although very proud of his Moldavian origin, was an ardent Russian patriot, since he lived in Bessarabia, Moldavian territory annexed by Russia. His philosophy is concerned with the destiny of Russia, and he is a slavophile and a messianistic. He argues for the development of a purely Russian philosophy, emerging from the careful study of the Russian language. According to him, Only such a philosophy can be national, an only this way the Russian element can be brought to universality. The way to arrive at such a philosophy is to continue the thinking of Skovoroda, the only authentic Russian philosopher up to then. This will fulfil the moment of existence for itself of the Russian nation.\n\nIoan Zalomit (1820–1885) studied the philosophy in France and in Germany, at Berlin, with Victor Cousin and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. He obtained here the title of doctor of philosophy with a thesis on Kant (1848). In his inaugural dissertation, Zalomit tries to overcome the Kantian opposition between laws of nature and moral laws. He affirms that liberty is inherent to nature, so that the moral laws are in fact laws of nature. All the moral actions are thus the result of a \"duty towards nature\". It is only this way that a rational theodicy is possible.\nSimeon Bărnuţiu (1808–1864) taught philosophy at the Blaj College, at the Mihaileana Academy and, finally, at the University of Iaşi. His remaining published courses are mostly adaptations after Krug, Beck, Rottek and Niemeyers. His most interesting contributions are to be found in the philosophy of right. A revolutionary, Bărnuţiu wanted to defend the right to self-determination of the Transylvanian Romanians. He found ideas suitable for his purpose in the philosophy of Krug, widely diffused in Transylvania by the Hungarian exponents of the \"philosophy of harmony\" - Samuel Köteles, János Hetény and Gusztáv Szontágh. Other influences came from Savigny. In his \"The Public Law of Romanians\" (1867) Bărnuţiu wanted to prove that Romanian law was in fact Roman law, which had been perpetuated throughout history. Further more, Roman law seemed to him to respect the natural rights of the individuals, as formulated in the Enlightenment theories of natural law.\nAt the end of this period, the most important and original thinker is Ion Heliade Rădulescu (1802–1872). Rădulescu studied at the Princely Academy from Bucharest, under Neophyte Doukas, and from 1818 migrated to the Romanian classes of Gheorghe Lazăr. After the death of Lazar he became a teacher in the Academy and he had a prodigious activity as a cultural animator. In 1828 he published an \"almost philosophical\" (in his words) \"Romanian Grammar\", influenced by Condillac, which he knew from his Greek teachers. After the turmoil of the 1848 Revolution, Heliade Rădulescu comes up with a philosophical system, inspired from kabala and the socialism of Proudhon and Fourier. There are also traces of Hegel's influence, but not directly read (he knew him probably from the works of Cousin). His two most important works are \"The Universal Critical History\" and \"Equilibrium between Antitheses\".\n\nHeliade Rădulescu proposes, against monisms and dualisms of all kind, a trinitarian philosophy. He affirms that all philosophical concepts come in dualities, which can be classified in two categories: sympathetic (or parallel) and antipathetic. A sympathetic duality is formed by two \"positive\" terms, which indicate an existence: time / space; spirit / matter; right / duty etc. An antipathetic duality contains a positive and a negative term: life / death; movement / inertia; good / evil etc. Now, each sympathetic duality produces a third term, through which the dualism is overcome. Here are some examples: spirit / matter / universe; form / substance / body; progress / conservation / perfectibility; spiritual man / physical man / moral man. Beginning from here, Heliade Rădulescu develops a kind of cosmology, by means of naïve although ingenious geometrical considerations. He means thus to offer a metaphysical explanation of progress and then, armed with this metaphysics, to fight the liberalism. For his final purpose is to offer an argument in support of his political position, called \"progressive conservatism\". To those who reply that this is an inconsistent position, he answers that the duality progress / conservation is not antipathetic, but sympathetic, and that only a progressive conservatism is perfectible.\n\nIn 1860 and 1864 Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza founds the Universities of Iaşi and Bucharest, and in 1866 Karl von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen becomes, under the name Carol I, Domnitor of the Principality of Romania, which will later become the Kingdom of Romania. This event marks a new wave of westernization, as well as a reaction against the formerly prevalent cultural model, that of Enlightenment. Almost at the same time, in 1863, the \"Junimnea\" literary society is founded in Iaşi.\n\nThe last thirty years of the 19th century are culturally dominated by the Junimea society. The Romanian philosophy will have a new beginning and, for the first time, an international echo. The philosophers from Junimea were Titu Maiorescu (1840–1917), Vasile Conta (1846–1882), Alexandru Xenopol (1847–1920), Mihai Eminescu (1850–1889), Constantin Leonardescu (1844–1907), Ioan Pop Florantin (1843–1926).\nTitu Maiorescu studied the philosophy in Berlin, and obtained his two doctorates from the University of Giessen, and later from the University of Paris. His first philosophical paper was \"Einiges Philosophische in gemeinfasslicher Form\" (1860), a work that was rather well received, written under the influence of Herbart and Feuerbach. In Romanian, his most important contribution was a \"Logic\" (1876), influenced by Herbart, who had numerous reprints and served as a textbook until the years 1930. He was a proponent of Kant's philosophy, and he was skeptical with respect to the possibility of an original, creative, Romanian philosophy.\nVasile Conta obtained his doctorate from the Université libre de Bruxelles and functioned as a Professor of Law at the University of Iaşi. His works, published in Romanian and French, included \"La théorie du fatalisme\" (1877) and \"La théorie de l’ondulation universelle\" (1895). Conta was influenced by three sources: the evolutionist philosophy of Herbert Spencer, the positivism of August Compte, and the German materialism of Büchner, Vogt, and Moleschott. In his first work he defends a version of determinism, called \"fatalism\", and proposes a materialist theory of knowledge (or rather, a materialist model of cognition). Cognition is accounted for in terms of material modifications of the brain. He thought that sensorial input is transmitted through the nervous fibres under the form of \"shakings\", or vibrations, which provoke the apparition of physiological changes in the brain, called \"imprintings\". In the second cited work, Conta proposes a materialist metaphysics, affirming the wave-like character of the universe; according to this conception, the evolution of the universe as a whole, and of each entity in this universe has a wave-like character. Conta wrote also books on the history of metaphysics, on the nature of metaphysics, on the \"first principles that constitute the world\". He dissociated from the positivists of his time by arguing for the importance of metaphysics and for the presence of an artistic element in the construction of the metaphysical systems.\nAlexandru Xenopol, historian and philosopher, had two doctorates, one of them in philosophy, conferred from the University of Giessen. His philosophy emerged from his constant preoccupations with history. In his most famous work, La théorie de l’histoire, Xenopol presents a philosophy of science of the utmost importance and interest. He draws a distinction between facts of repetition, and facts of succession. The facts of repetition are studied by the natural sciences, and are characterised by natural laws. The facts of succession are studied by the sciences of the spirit, notably by history, and they are not subsumed to any law, but they form series. Xenopol was considered by Rickert one of his precursors. He also discussed the concept of causality, the notion of hypothesis and of the verification of hypothesis. His views on space and time oppose Kantian doctrines, and he argues explicitly against the German philosopher, who in his opinion had turned history into a mere fairy tale.\n\nMihai Eminescu, the Romanian national poet, studied philosophy at Viena and Berline. Apparently he was preparing a thesis on the philosophy of history, but he never got his PhD. He is the author of the first Romanian (partial) translation of the \"Critique of Pure Reason\". Many of his poems and prose contain, in appropriate literary form, quite a few philosophical ideas, mainly influenced by Kant, Schopenhauer, and Buddhism, but he never wrote philosophical texts proper. On the other hand, his political philosophy, exposed in newspaper articles and editorials is quite distinctive. Eminescu is one of the most important and influential Romanian conservative political thinkers of the last decades of the 19th century.\n\nConstantin Leonardescu studied at the Universities of Bucharest and Paris, and was a professor of philosophy in the University of Iaşi. Generally, he was influenced by the French eclecticism and he had a thoroughly \"scientific\" attitude in philosophy. Like many of his time, Leonardescu had a great interested in psychology, science which he tried to apply to diverse domains of philosophy, such as epistemology and aesthetics. His long list of published books includes \"Philosophy Face to the Progress of Positive Sciences\" (1876), \"Metaphysics, Religion and Science\" (1884), \"The Principles of Psychology\" (1892), \"The Inductive Morals or the Science of the Human Behaviour\" (1885) etc.\nIoan Pop Florantin, a doctor of philosophy of the University of Vienna, taught philosophy in several high-schools in Iaşi. He authored several books on logic, psychology, and general philosophy, as well as the first Romania treatise on aesthetics (1874). He advanced also a personal conception called \"the universal consecutionism\", a kind of materialistic process metaphysics. From this position he summoned \"the true Einstein\" to the \"tribunal of logic\" towards the end of his life.\n\nPrince Grigore Sturdza (1821–1901) was a learned man, who had philosophical preoccupations. He published some philosophical works in French, among which \"Les lois fondamentales de l'Univers\"(1891) is the most important. The book's subject-matter is chiefly the astronomy, or the scientific cosmology, which eventually serves as a basis for metaphysical speculations.\n\nOutside the borders of the Principality, later Kingdom, of Romania, we can notice the activity of Vasile Lucaciu (1852–1922), from Maramures, a northern part of Transylvania. Of Greek-catholic confession, he studied at Rome where he obtained his doctorate in theology and philosophy. He is the author of a Thomist philosophical system, \"Institutions of Philosophy\", published between 1881 and 1884 in three volumes: \"Logic\" (1881), \"Metaphysics\" (1882), and \"Moral Philosophy\" (1884).\n\nDuring the 20th century, the history of Romanian philosophy can be divided in three periods: the pre-communist period, the communist period, and the post-communist period.\n\nTwo major \"schools\" of philosophy have produced, in the first half of the century, two peaks of Romanian philosophy: the school of Maiorescu, and the school of Nae Ionescu. Transylvanian philosophers can also be grouped together, mostly by reason of their non affiliation to the two other schools, but also on the reason of their belonging to the same spiritual family. Apart this three \"schools\" or orientations, there are many other authors, cultivating with predilection the philosophical essay. A special mention deserve the members of the Onicescu circle, aptly characterised as analytic philosophers.\n\nThe \"Maiorescians\" are Constantin Rădulescu-Motru (1868–1957), P. P. Negulescu (1872–1951), Dumitru Draghicescu (1875–1945), Ion Petrovici (1882–1972), and Mircea Florian (1888–1960).\n\nConstantin Rădulescu-Motru, the grandson of Eufrosin Poteca, called his philosophical system \"Energetic Personalism\", influenced by the Otswald's energetism and Stern's personalism. An expert in experimental psychology (he studied under Wundt, getting his doctorate with a dissertation on Kant), he followed the inductivist trend in metaphysics. The human personality was considered by him a superior form of energy, the final stage of the evolution of the universe. His metaphysics implies a political program as well as an ethics of labor. The purpose of the political life must be the transition from the \"anarchic personalism\" that governed the Romanian society to \"energetic personalism\".\n\nP. P. Negulescu published a \"Philosophy of the Renaissance\" still readable and a capital study in the philosophy of culture, called \"The Genesis of the Forms of the Culture\".\n\nDumitru Draghicescu obtained his licence in philosophy with a memoir on the \"Influence of Kant on Auguste Compte\" (1901) at the University of Bucharest, continuing his studies in Paris, where he did his doctorate with Durkheim. In his youth he was under the influence of Conta's materialist philosophy. Draghicescu had major contributions in social philosophy (he was also an important sociologist). One of Draghicescu's books, \"Vérité et révelation: vers une nouvelle idée de Dieu\" (2 volumes, 1934), was very well received by Charles Hartshorne, for the authentically new aspects of the concept of God which it put forth. Draghicescu considered that man is the being the limit of whose development is divinity, saying that all of God's attributes can be applied as such to man, considered in his potentiality and historical destiny.\nIon Petrovici wrote on logic and metaphysics. In logic he contributed to the logical theory of notions, mainly regarding the relations between the intension and the extension of a term; he contradicted the law of their inverse dependence. In metaphysics perhaps the most well known of his contributions is the lecture \"The Idea of Nothingness\" (1933), in which the nothingness was determined as a \"transcendent substance\", preceding existence and transcending it, but manifesting itself immanently in the existent things.\n\nMircea Florian, who studied in Germany with the Neokantian Rehmke, elaborated between the wars a philosophy of the \"pure datum\", trying to overcome the epistemology based on the subject-object dichotomy. His results are published in the volume \"Philosophical Reconstruction\" (1943).\n\nThe \"Ionescians\" grouped around their teacher and/or friend, Nae Ionescu (1890–1940). He earned his PhD in Germany, with a study on \"logistic\", i.e., in the terminology of the epoch, mathematical logic. He actually rejected mathematical logic, thinking it is reductive even in comparison to classical logic. His thinking on logic in general may be regarded as a form of intuitionism. He published only newspaper articles, where he held strongly conservative, reactionary views, and he quickly moved toward the extreme right. After his death, some of his students and associates (Noica, Amzăr, Eliade, Onicescu, Vulcănescu) published his various lectures on Logic, History of Logic, Epistemology (i.e. Theory of Knowledge) and on Metaphysics and The History of Metaphysics. His approach to the History of Philosophy is mostly typological, not chronological. Nae Ionescu's thought could be described overall as an existential philosophy of Christian authenticity, called \"Trăirism\" (from the verb \"a trăi\", to live), an autochthonous version of Existentialism influenced by vitalism and Orthodox theology. Many late commentators have accused him of \"plagiarism\", neglecting that he never wrote his lectures, not even lecture notes; Ionescu creatively improvised, and on many occasions one can recognise ideas initiated by Bergson, Scheler, Heidegger; his charisma was impressive, and students were completely captivated by the fact that he philosophised on the spot, in the course room, without preconceptions, giving interesting answers to issues they raised, and provoking a certain spiritual tension, with an impetus toward thinking on one's own. Because he was quite ironic, always disposed toward revising his thought and never wrote philosophy proper, his disciples compared him to Socrates.\n\nThe most important of his adherents were Mircea Vulcanescu (1904–1952), Mircea Eliade (1907–1986), Emil Cioran (1911–1995), Constantin Noica (1909–1987). Others like Petre Ţuţea were also influenced by his personality, and philosophers like Alexandru Dragomir and Mihai Şora attended some of his courses.\n\nMircea Vulcanescu had an enormous erudition, being considered by many the chief of the \"generation\", but did not publish significant philosophical papers. He did, however, influence Romanian philosophy with his seminal essay \"The Romanian Dimension of Existence\". In this work he analyses the conceptual paradigm that serves as a means of evaluation of diverse philosophical visions by Romanians. By analysing certain Romanian phrases, in what he calls a phenomenological manner, he claims to unravel the inherent worldview. For example, from an analysis of the linguistic particularities of negation in the Romanian language, he deduces the Romanian ethos, with traits like fatalism or indifference regarding death, an easygoing attitude toward life, the conception that there is no alternative but also nothing irremediable.\n\nMircea Eliade, the well-known scholar of the history of religions, published a few essays showing the influence of his teacher Ionescu, but through these early works he brought nothing essentially new in the landscape of the Romanian philosophy. He was, however, a very important person in the intellectual landscape of the 1930s, another possible \"leader\" of a new generation.\n\nEmil Cioran, in his early books written in Romanian, proposed a philosophy of despair, shows a morbid obsession with death, all expressed in a deeply lyrical manner. He wrote mostly on nihilist themes of Nietzschean and Schopeanhaurean provenance, with some contemporary influences like Giovanni Papini and Nicolai Berdiaev.\n\nConstantin Noica debuted with an essay called \"Mathesis, or Simple Joys\". The short book glosses on the distinction between life and geometry. After this essay Noica will orientate himself towards the history of philosophy, writing on Kant, Leibniz, Descartes, Plato, Aristotle, Hume etc. His PhD thesis was called \"A Sketch for the History of How Something New May be Possible\", where he tries to answer how the spirit is not \"endlessly tautologous\", analysing European philosophy from Plato to Hume.\n\nTransylvania produced between the Wars three remarkable thinkers: Lucian Blaga (1895–1961), D. D. Rosca (1895–1980), and Eugeniu Sperantia (1888–1972).\n\nLucian Blaga's philosophical system, called \"ekstatic intellectualism\" is a highly original construction, with roots in the philosophy of Kant, psychoanalysis, and Patristic philosophy. The system was projected in five monumental \"trilogies\", but only three were achieved and a fourth was partially elaborated. The trilogies are, in order: \"The Trilogy of Knowledge\", \"The Trilogy of Culture\", \"The Trilogy of Values\", and \"The Cosmological Trilogy\".\n\nThe metaphysical vision of Blaga centres around a mysterious metaphysical source or principle he called \"The Great Anonymous\", which creates the Universe indirectly, by mutilating the forms of existence that emanate from him, in order to avoid the possibility of the apparition of another Great Anonymous. The results of these acts of mutilation are infinitesimal fragments, structured in types, and called \"divine differentials\". The extant beings appear by the aggregation of these differentials. The speculative cosmology of Blaga also includes an entelechial interpretation of evolutionist biology.\n\nHis theory of knowledge asserts the existence of an \"unconscious spirit\" endowed with his own set of categories which double the Kantian categories of the conscious spirit. These categories of the unconscious prevent humans from completely revealing the mystery of existence, since all his knowledge must fit into this categorical framework. Thus, the Great Anonymous maintains an isolated \"centrality of existence\", because a complete knowledge would make the man godlike, but also infuses human activity with a creative tension. Blaga's metaphysical axiology also follows this conception. All categories encompass human powers of expression, and their dynamic influence is finally projected into values. In other words, what we can not overcome, we idolise. This \"finalist self-deluding\" repetitively ensures the creative destiny of mankind.\n\nAll human culture is according to Blaga the result of man's trying to reveal the mysteries of existence, it constitutes the man's being. Since man can not reveal completely the mysteries, because of the \"transcendent censure\" exerted by the unconscious categorial scheme, all his productions bear the mark of this dynamic framework. The totality of these categories at some point is called a \"stylistic matrix\", and they have the structure of a \"cosmoid\", that is of a small universe, i.e. a self-sufficient order. Thus, each culture is characterised by a style, in which different categories activate and wear off successively, until the complete exhaustion of the stylistic matrix. At that moment, the culture generated by the attempts of revelation within the respective stylistic matrix dies. This vision is inspired by, but significantly detached from the morphological theory of culture, as exposed by a Frobenius or a Spengler. Blaga discusses extensively, with many illustrations why all these theories missed the point.\n\nD. D. Rosca, who would later be the coordinator and translator of the series of complete works of Hegel into Romanian, arrived at a philosophical synthesis presented in his book \"The Tragic Existence\". It is a personal blend of existentialism, with roots in Kierkegaard, but influenced also by Hegel. His PhD thesis at the Sorbonne, \"The Influence of Hegel on Taine\", as well as his translation in French of the \"Life of Jesus\" made him a known name in the French-speaking world.\n\nEugeniu Sperantia was a very prolific author. He began his list of publications with his PhD thesis, \"The Pragmatic Apriorism\", a rethinking of Kant's Transcendental Analytic from a Pragmatist stand-point. He wrote subsequently on various subjects, like the biology from a Hegelian perspective, gaining a reputation especially in the field of the philosophy of right. He was a pioneer in the field of erotetic logic (the logic of interrogatives), which he called \"problematology\". A very interesting and most neglected work is his \"System of Metaphysics: Implicit in the Postulates of Any Possible Knowledge\". We have here a theoretical innovation in metaphysics: Sperantia replaces the categorial theories of classical metaphysics with the analysis of the most general questions, analysis rendered possible by his problematology. Thus, the framework-theory of metaphysics becomes the logic of the interrogatives. Recently, his conception of metaphysics was compared to that of Collingwood.\n\nFrom the multitude of philosophical authors unaffiliated to the previous three currents we can mention here (almost randomly) Vasile Bancilă (1897–1979), Ionel Gherea, Anton Dumitriu (1905–1992) and Stéphane Lupasco (1900–1988).\n\nVasile Bancilă wrote two important commentaries on Blaga and Radulescu-Motru, and gave a valuable reply to Blaga's \"Mioritic Space\", also called \"plai\", opposing what Bancilă called \"The Space of Bărăgan\". Blaga's book maintained that the unconscious category of space which operates in the Romanian stylistic matrix was \"the space indefinitely wave-like\", an alternation on ups and downs, as a sinusoid. The name \"mioritical\" comes from \"mioriţa\", diminutive of sheep, i.e. an Ewe, the famous title of a popular ballad that is widely considered as quite relevant of the Romanian worldview, written in a peculiar alternating style. These are highly metaphorical and playful descriptions of a specific ethos common to significant cultural regions loosely related to a geographical space. Blaga also contends one may live in a plain but reflect a \"mioritic plai\" ethos, and that a specific ethos may become dominant even while it remains \"minor\" (the term is not loaded with value in Blaga's philosophy) and this \"style\" may absorb others while also being influenced by them. Bancilă on the other hand tried to show that Romanian culture as a whole does not reflect only a single \"abysmal\" category of space, the \"plai\" structure pointed out by Blaga, and he subsequently tried to show the existence of a \"Bărăgan space\" (Bărăgan is the name of the greatest plain in Romania); a space not determined by the alternating relief of hills or mountains, but by the flat plain.\n\nIonel Gherea, son of the noted Marxist sociologist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, published a book called \"The I and the World: Essay in Anthropomorphic Cosmogony\". This much too neglected work contains a still interesting discussion of the concept of personal identity. The author does an unusual amount of conceptual analysis, although in extremely general lines he is a phenomenologist of Husserlian orientation.\n\nAnton Dumitriu, mathematician by initial formation, obtained a PhD in philosophy then became the assistant of P. P. Negulescu. He was among the first philosophers in Romania interested in the philosophy of science, subject he treated in \"The Philosophical bases of Science\". He introduces in Romania the latest mathematical logic, mostly by his works \"The New Logic\" and \"The Polyvalent Logic\", where he presents the Russell–Whitehead axiomatic system of \"Principia Mathematica\", and C.I. Lewis’ system of strict implication. Also, he researched intensively the problem of logical - semantic paradoxes, having the conviction that the solution to them was already available in the works of the Scholastic philosophers.\n\nStéphane Lupasco, renowned francophone philosopher of science, tried to lay the basis of a new epistemology, consonant with the then newly developed quantum mechanics. He advocated a logic of the included third, which conducted him to sustain the existence of third state, beyond matter and energy.\n\nIn the 1940s the mathematician Octav Onicescu conducted a seminar in philosophy of science at the University of Bucharest. Among the most important members of this group of scientific philosophy were fellow mathematicians Grigore Moisil and Dan Barbilian as well as other notorious scientists like Şerban Ţiţeica or Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen. They were engaged in foundational research, using mathematics as a formal instrument of conceptual analysis. Their results were published in the anthology \"The Problem of Determinism\", or in some monographs as Onicescu's \"Principles of Scientific Knowledge\", Georgescu-Roegen's \"The Statistical Method\" or P. Sergescu's \"Mathematical Thinking\".\n\nWithin the first decade of totalitarianism, Romanian philosophical life was dominated by the persecution of all important interbellum philosophers. Lucretiu Patrascanu (1900–1954) was the author of a work, \"Currents and Tendencies in Romanian Philosophy\", which will establish for decades the status of the Romanian philosophers. With mostly rudimentary means, over-simplifications, appealing to the \"Marxist-Leninist\" doctrine, Patrascanu polemicized with major philosophers as Blaga, Radulescu-Motru, Florian, Cioran and \"exposed\" them as idealists, irrationalists, mystics, bourgeois, imperialists and sometimes fascists. Among the local pseudo-Marxists a new star emerged quickly, Constantin I. Gulian (1914-2011), a member of the Romanian Academy since 1955 until his death. Gulian produced at the peak of his career several expositions of Hegelian philosophy, completely lacking any value. During these first decades, philosophy was taught in Universities by dentists or illiterate workers turned into professors virtually overnight: Following Stalin's death, hardcore communist dogma slowly lost some of its force.\n\nAfter 1964, the date of the great amnesty of all political prisoners, philosophical life had a chance to come back into existence, partly catalysed by the professional reinsertion of the relatively few surviving philosophers, who were either imprisoned or marginalized. Thus, we can distinguish several \"schools\" of philosophers: the interbellum school, the Păltiniş school and the Epistemological School of Bucharest. Independent figures existed, of course, mostly as university professors.\n\nThe name of \"school\" may be even more inappropriate in this case than it was before, when we spoke of Nae Ionescu's school or of that of Titu Maiorescu. The Interbellum school should be seen in the same manner we speak of \"the old school\". The most important philosophers formed in the interbellum period, that could practice again philosophy, and remained significantly creative are: Mircea Florian, Constantin Noica, Anton Dumitriu, Mihai Şora (b. 1916), Petre Ţuţea (1902–1991), Alexandru Dragomir (1916–2002).\n\nMircea Florian wrote in the 1960s in solitude a system of philosophy presented in a two-volume treatise called \"Recessivity as the Structure of the World\". Inspired by an analogy with genetic biology, Florian arrives at the conclusion that experience is characterised by an invariant, the relation of recessivity that holds between two concepts. This relation is neither a relation of opposition, like the contrariety, nor one of concordance, like the subordination. It is a special relation which exhibits features of both types of inter-notional relation acknowledged by logic. It is both a relation of subordination, and a relation of opposition. In a pair of concepts united by this relation, there is one which is hierarchically superior, called the \"dominant\" concept, and another which, although hierarchically inferior, is ontologically superior, called the \"recessive\" concept. Florian shows that every important concept of philosophy belongs to a pair which instantiates recessivity. He analysed several dozens of such pairs, writing for each term practically a micro-monograph.\n\nConstantin Noica became during this time, after his release from prison, a continental metaphysician of European dimensions, arguably one of the greatest of the late 20th century. His first book published after detention was \"27 Steps of the Real\" in which he unifies three categorial systems, those of Plato, Aristotle, and Kant. Under a Hegelian, but maybe also influenced by Nicolai Hartmann, he thought that reality, divided in three realms, inorganic, organic and spiritual, is characterised by three distinct sets of categories. At the peak of this categorial ladder he put a new category, which reflects the impact that physics had on his thought: the undulation, or the wave, which became thus the supreme category.\n\nHe later developed the theory initiated by Vulcănescu, and wrote several books which brought him overnight celebrity, especially in literary circles. Books as \"Creation and Beauty in Romanian Speech\", or \"The Romanian Sentiment of Being\", masterpieces of etymological speculation and philosophical hermeneutics, have obviously limited universal value, of interest only to those researching Romanian spirituality per se. In these books Noica arrived at the conclusion that the Romanian language possesses a word, a preposition, which mediates its unique access to the realm of being. It is the preposition \"întru\", which expresses the processuality of the being or what he calls \"the becoming in-towards (întru) Being\". This idiomatic preposition, of Latin provenance (\"intro\") stands for more than a spatial inclusion: it indicates a going on, a movement both toward something, and within that something i.e. a movement of participation.\n\nHis ontology (more correctly called metaphysics) is edified without the idiomatic peculiarities in two later works, and consists of \"The Becoming in-to the Being\" and \"Letters on the Logic of Hermes\", but it was incipient since \"Six Maladies of the Contemporary Spirit\". In these works Noica shows how the monolithic unity of being is broken, and being displays three instances; The being of first instance is arrived at phenomenologically. As such, the being of things appears as a functional model, the structure Individual – Determinations – General (I-D-G), which the things are striving to realise. But the model of the being is rarely found realised like that; most currently it is incomplete, only two of the three terms being present. Thus, there are six incomplete, unsaturated formations, called by Noica \"ontological precariousness\" or \"maladies of being\" (or \"of the spirit\", in \"Six maladies...\"). These maladies, schematically represented as I-G, G-I, I-D, D-I, D-G, and G-D, are what he calls the rule of the real. Then, the being of second instance is the \"element\", characterised as an individual-general, which is an entity that is not a particular, i.e. its conditions of identity do not make reference to a single spatio-temporal location. Something is an individual-general if it distributes itself without dividing. Like the Whiteheadian ingression, the \"distribution without dividing\" is a rethinking of the Platonic participation. A favourite exemplification of the nature of an element is for Noica the concept of biological species. The elements are characterised by different categories than the things, of a speculative nature, like unity-multiplicity-totality, reality-possibility-necessity. The being of the third instance, or the being qua being, is theorised in several pages of an incredible density, and in a language close to theology. Noica attempts to rethink here the problem of the one and the many, in a Parmenidean – Platonic style. He formulates as a criterion for being the same \"distribution without dividing\".\n\nMethodologically, Noica can be considered, paradoxically, an anti-Hegelian Hegelian. He revises Hegelian dialectics, accused explicitly by Noica of being dominated by the \"ethos of neutrality\". In Hegelian logic, Noica contends, Hegel himself must intervene in order to give the concepts the necessary impetus for their movement. They do not have in themselves the power to move dialectically. Noica considers that dialectics is circular and tetradic. The scheme thesis – antithesis – synthesis is replaced by him with the rival scheme theme – anti-theme – thesis – theme (refound). The spirit, Noica says, begins not with a thesis, but with a thematic horizon in which it moves, and into which it digs repeatedly, going more and more toward the intimacy of this horizon. Several of Noica's peculiar paradoxical concepts, which allow him to articulate his views on dialectics, are difficult to comprehend, and require much sympathy from the reader: \"the non-limiting limitation\", \"the opening closure\" etc.\n\nNoica's philosophy is also concerned with the problem of reason and the problem of the individual. He redefines reason as \"the conscience of the becoming in-to being\". The philosopher wanted to save the individual from \"the tyranny of the general\", to give to the individual an \"ontological dignity\". He was deeply disturbed by the image of the individual as a simple instance of something general, as a simple particular case of a general rule. But he also intended to maintain the reality of the general natures, not wanting to reduce them to mere collections or classes of individuals. Thus, he rejected both Platonic realism, and nominalism of all kinds. Instead of choosing between nominalism and realism, he proposes a third version, which insists on the solidarity existent between the individual and the general, linked by their determinations. His triangle I-D-G forms thus an irreducible unity, reminiscent of Peirce's triad.\n\nConstantin Noica formed around him an unofficial school of philosophy, based at Păltiniş, a mountain location where he spent his last living years. Păltiniş became a place of pilgrimage for young Romanian intellectuals, who went there in search of a spiritual mentor. Noica became thus a kind of national institution with an influence unequalled by any other intellectual figure before or after him. He imposed to his disciples the intensive study of Greek and German, and he asked them to approach \"cultures\", not authors and certainly not isolated books. He had an effervescent activity of translation, initiating in collaboration with Petru Creţia the integral edition of Plato in Romanian. He also translated from neo-Platonic Aristotelian commentators, Dexippus, Ammonius, Porphyry and others. He contributed to the translation of Kant's \"Critique of Judgement\", and he translated from Chorydaleus, the \"Introduction to logic\" and the \"Commentary to Metaphysics\". He himself wrote commentaries and interpretations of Plato, Aristotle, and Hegel, and encouraged the introduction of Heidegger's writings. He was by far the most brilliant philosopher of post-war Romania.\n\nAnton Dumitriu continued after 1964 his initial preoccupations, publishing in the philosophy of mathematics and in the theory and history of logic. His monumental \"History of Logic\", although a landmark of Romanian philosophy and of the discipline, suffered from notable shortcomings and had a rather bad reception in the West. Dumitriu included too much on some topics of his history, with chapters on the transcendental and dialectical logic, and too little on others, not treating many branches of recent logic, or treating them completely sketchily and insufficiently, as in the case of modal logic. Also, he was misinformed on issues concerning Scholastic philosophy. However, there are many parts of this work that are still valuable today.\n\nAnton Dumitriu wrote also a series of essays, more literary in style, which made him appreciated by the Romanian intellectual milieu, centered on literature. His book \"Philosophia Mirabilis\" is an essay on the esoteric dimension of the Greek philosophy, \"Eleatic Cultures and Heracleitean Cultures\", a comparative essay in the philosophy of culture, and \"Aletheia\", a study of the Greek meaning of truth and of philosophy, where he criticises Heidegger's position in \"Introduction to Metaphysics\".\n\nMihai Şora was a student of Nae Ionescu and Mircea Eliade, but younger than the members of the so-called ’27 generation. He obtained in 1938 a bourse at the Sorbonne, where he went for preparing a thesis on Pascal. During wartime he wrote a book called \"On the Interior Dialogue\", published only in 1947 at Gallimard, and well received by Jacques Maritain and Étienne Gilson. In this work Sora explores the problem of human authenticity, in an existential tone, but influenced greatly by Scholastic philosophy (notably that of Thomas Aquinas and Nicolaus Cusanus) and by Marxism (he was a member of the French communist party and a member of the Résistance).\n\nIn 1948 he returned to Romania, and couldn't leave the country anymore. He did not publish anything until the end of the 70s, when he began a cycle of four books, containing a philosophical system, achieved only in 2005. During the communist regime he wrote and published three of the four books composing the cycle: \"The Salt of the Earth\", \"To be, the do, to have\" and \"I & You & He & She or the Generalised Dialogue\". His last book is called \"The Instant and the Time\". His system consists of an ontology, a poetics, an ethics and a political philosophy, all deriving from an original \"ontological model\". The influences comes from Péguy, Pascal, the Scholastics and from Husserl. Sora considered himself ever since his first book as \"Cartesian of the utmost consequence\", i.e. a phenomenologist.\n\nHis concept of intentionality, crucial for the comprehension of his philosophy, was neither that of Brentano, nor that of Husserl, but an original one with deep roots in the Scholastic philosophy. In-tentio, derived from \"IN aliud TENDERE\" is the penetrating act of the spirit, which goes beyond the things into their origin, which is the Unum with his three transcendentals: \"Bonum, Verum\" and \"Pulchrum\". Thus, there are three forms of intentionality, moral, theoretical and esthetical, characterising three types of human attitudes toward the world. The \"Unum\" is not viewed only as an actus purus, but rather as an \"universal potentiality of being\". As such, i.e. is placed, in Şora's metaphorical model, at the centre of a sphere of null radius, which has, thus, the same topos as the periphery. The surface of this sphere represents the pure exteriority, composed of \"terminal actualities\". The radius is the geometrical locus of the interiority, where we find the \"intermediary potentialities\".\n\nMihai Şora is considered the mentor of another \"school\", much more discrete and heterogeneous than the school of Noica, and there is currently an increasing interest in his work, especially from the young philosophers grouped around the \"Studia Phaenomonelogica\" philosophical review.\n\nPetre Ţuţea had a PhD in Administrative Law. Before and during the Second World War he worked as a director in the Ministry of National Economy, and was known and appreciated by all members of the '27 generation as one of their own, even though he was a little older. He widely gained the reputation of a rhetorical genius, when he spoke everybody stood and listened. Some even considered him \"a leader of his generation\". Initially having youthful Marxist convictions, he developed right-wing nationalist sympathies, that would later lead to his arrest and conviction. In prison he rediscovered Christianity, and after his release he considered himself a Christian philosopher. Although due to his political antecedents and uncompromising content of philosophical ideas and religious faith Ţuţea could not publish very much, he wrote a considerable amount, including a late work projected in five volumes, \"Problems, Systems, Styles, Sciences\" and finally \"Dogmas\". He completed the first two, and a small part of \"Styles\" and \"Dogmas\" – of which the first two volumes were published posthumously. \"The Philosophy of Nuances\" is also an important essay, a veritable manifesto for a new philosophy, dating back to 1969. Ţuţea was influenced by a whole plethora of intellectual personalities, but mostly by Plato, Greek Skepticism, Leibniz, Nietzsche, Bergson, Simmel and the fictionalism of Hans Vaihinger. The only significant Romanian philosophical influences were Lucian Blaga and Nae Ionescu. Theologically, he was under the sway of St. Paul, Augustine and later Thomas Aquinas, while he also knew and admired the major contemporary Romanian theologian, Fr. Dumitru Stăniloae, whom he met in prison. Ţuţea also appreciated various thinkers like Werner Sombart, and frequently refers to scientists like Heisenberg and Poincaré.\n\nInitially Ţuţea rejected the categories of Western idealism, replacing the Kantian conceptual framework with a spectrum of empirical-phenomenological nuances. His later philosophy, as he declares, is an effort of \"theologal\" (not theological) thinking. He argues that Truth is unique, but human reason cannot find it by itself, although it can be a receptacle of truth. Thus, in order to really know the truth, man needs inspiration and revelation. Man is never autonomous, and all intellectual efforts like science or philosophy are only means of producing fictions, at the level of material and cultural comfort. Ţuţea believed that science and philosophy by themselves don’t even have a consoling function, being essentially irrelevant with respect to the most dramatic issues, like death. Thus, only religion (specifically, Christianity) possesses the truth and bears relevance to the destiny of humankind. Without it, he says, man is just \"a rational animal that comes from nowhere and doesn't go anywhere\". Anthropologically, Ţuţea analyzed what he calls \"Christian man\"; the anthropological model to be pursued is that of the saint.\n\nŢuţea was undoubtedly an unusual, Socratic figure, in the sense of a major, exemplary personality, and his writing style is quite peculiar. His various writings are hardly classifiable, and even though he never finished whatever he started, after his release from prison Ţuţea elaborated at least three original literary-philosophical styles: The Philosophy of Nuances, Theatre as Seminar and Religious-theologal Reflections. One of Ţuţea's singular features, the so-called \"substantivization\" of predicates, related to his manner of writing sentences without verbs, as well as the many resonant repetitions he calls \"leit-motifs\" and constant nuancing of terms, coupled with a rejection of systems and the absence of philosophical speculation stuns most critics, who have no idea what to make of this unusual manner of thinking and writing, in a cultural environment mostly dominated by belletristic writing or academic exegesis. The Romanian public came to know his personality only after 1989, when several interviews of Ţuţea, who was 89 years old were broadcast on TV and gained the admiration of a broad audience.\n\nThe subsequent publication of a collection of aphorisms gathered from interviews became a best seller, while his major writings are still not very well known or appreciated, although Ţuţea was always surrounded by friends who typed and multiplied his manuscripts. Neighbours usually called him \"Professor\", because he always seemed to lecture, but as he ironically pointed out, his legendary tenured \"chair\" was under the blue sky, in the campus of Cişmigiu - a central park in Bucharest, very close to his studio apartment. Several of his close friends and companions such as Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, Petre Pandrea, later Marcel Petrişor, Aurel-Dragoş Munteanu and from the younger generation Radu Preda and Alexandru Popescu are also accomplished philosophers, writers and scholars.\n\nAlexandru Dragomir is a late discovery of the Romanian public, actively promoted by the Humanitas Publishing House (led by Gabriel Liiceanu), which edited some of his notebooks. Dragomir, a former doctoral student of Heidegger, was a reticent man who wrote secretly and never intended to publish anything. In his old days he began giving private seminaries, which he carried on until his death; only a very narrow group of intellectuals attended. After he died several loosely thematic notebooks were found, proving that Dragomir was a phenomenologist of great class. Among these manuscripts, whose publication is not finished, there are several with reflections on time, which form the most consistent part of his thought. The influence of Dragomir on Romanian philosophy is still developing. \"Studia Phaenomenologica\" dedicated one of its issues to him.\n\nConstantin Noica was in a continuous search for the gifted young philosophers, which he discovered and trained. Among these (at that time) young men, there are several which have manifested themselves in the philosophical and literary, or rather literary-philosophical Romanian environment. Such are Gabriel Liiceanu (b. 1942), Andrei Pleşu (b. 1948), Sorin Vieru (b. 1933), Andrei Cornea (b. 1952), Vasile Dem. Zamfirescu, Alexandru Surdu (b. 1938) and Corneliu Mircea.\n\nGabriel Liiceanu grew to prominence after he published \"The Păltiniş Diary\", where he described his paideic adventure under Noica's guidance. It was also the book that transformed Noica into a sort of philosophical star. The \"Diary\" is perhaps the most influent Romanian philosophical publication of the late 1980s, initiating a fascination of younger generations with Păltiniş, and encouraging the study ancient Greek, Latin and German as prerequisites for the serious study of philosophy. Liiceanu's own philosophical project initially centered around the idea of \"limit\", and he therefore called his hermeneutic inquiry into the nature and history of this concept \"peratology\" (from the Greek \"peras\" = limit). This program initiated with \"The Tragic. A Phenomenology of Limit and Overcoming\", his PhD thesis, where he lays much accent on Nietzsche, and accomplished with \"On Limit\", the final and more general expression of his peratology. \"On Limit\" touches on various topics such as of liberty, destiny, responsibility, encounter with the other, in a framework basically Heideggerian. Liiceanu also accomplished the translation of Heidegger into Romanian.\n\nAndrei Pleşu was first known as an art historian, but also as a subtle philosopher. He avows being more interested in the \"light\" side of philosophy, as he had a \"respectful antipathy\" towards Aristotle, and considered that he had absolutely no use for Hegel. He oriented himself toward ethics and the philosophy of religion. His focal idea is that of the \"interval\", the in-between of existence, as a space of itinerancy. Plesu wrote one of the very few Romanian treatises of ethics, \"Minima Moralia\", which is subtitled \"an ethics of the interval\". It begins by affirming that only the man in the condition of itinerancy has moral competence, needing to make choices at every step of the way. Thus, true ethics is not a major one of the great problems and puzzles, but a minor ethics of the quotidian life and of ordinary situations. Further on, he explored the theme of the interval in his \"On Angels\", a book of angelology, arising at the intersection between metaphysics and the philosophy of religion. In this book, the entities called angels are analysed as a cases of \"beings of the interval\". The entire exercise has thus the secondary value of ontology of the interval.\n\nSorin Vieru is one of the few Păltiniş logicians. He established his reputation by his researches on the classical syllogistic, which he axiomatised. He was also a specialist in Frege, from whom he translated abundantly. His interests covered also Greek philosophy, mostly Plato's political philosophy. He translated several of Plato's most difficult dialogues. Finally, he published an essay on \"The Risk of Thinking\", in collaboration with the mathematician Uther Morgenstern, alias Terente Robert.\n\nAndrei Cornea is a specialist in the ancient Greek philosophy and also a political thinker. During the communist regime he published little in the domain of philosophy, but he translated Plato's \"Republic\". After 1989 he published intensively. Thus, we can cite his interpretation to Plato from \"Plato. Philosophy and Censorship\", his interesting rehabilitation of the points of view sophistically rejected by Plato's Socrates from \"When Socrates is not Right\", or his proposing of replacing the concept of utopia with that of ek-topia, as opposed to en-topia, in \"From the School of Athens to the School of Paltinis\". But perhaps his most important contribution is the valuable critique of contemporary relativism from \"The Khazar Tournament\". He translated Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\" and a great part of Plotinus's \"Enneads\".\n\nVasile Dem. Zamfirescu's main interests are in psychoanalysis. Therefore, his philosophy bears the marks of these interests. He wrote a book on \"The Logic of the Heart and the Logic of the Mind\", well liked by Noica, and after 1989 he published his \"Philosophy of the Unconscious\" (2 volumes), exploring the philosophical potential of the psychoanalytical idea of unconscious.\n\nAlexandru Surdu was one of the earliest collaborators on Noica, but in a great measure independent. He specialised initially in logic, publishing books on \"Intuitionism\" and \"Intuitionist logic\". He also studied the Aristotelian logic, thus arriving to his \"The Theory of Pre-judicative Forms\", a rethinking of the categories with the means of formal logic. After 1989 he published on the Romanian philosophy and speculative philosophy. Notable volumes are \"The Pentamorphosis of the Art\" and \"The Speculative Philosophy\". Alexandru Surdu is, like Noica, an anti-Hegelian Hegelian. Thus, he criticises Hegel for his \"absolutisation\" of triadic dialectics, he criticises also Noica for absolutising the tetradic dialectics, while proposing his version of a pentadic dialectics. He maintains, though, that diverse experiential realms are to be investigated by diverse dialectics, binary, triadic, tetradic or pentadic. His philosophy continues the long-time discredited epistemology of the faculties, which he complicates by speaking of five faculties of thinking. Thus, we have: intellect, rational intellect, reason, speculative reason, and speculation. The categories of the systematic philosophy, as determined by Surdu, are also five: Transcendence/Subsistence, Being, Existence, Real Existence, and Reality. Surdu was one of the translators of Wittgenstein's \"Tractatus\" into Romanian and he translated also from Kant.\n\nCorneliu Mircea is a psychiatrist and also a philosopher, encouraged by Noica, but not actually one of his disciples. Still, his interests, themes, and style, places him in the Păltiniş circle, where he paid visits regularly. He published quite consistently. During communism he gave, among other publications, \"The Book of Being\", \"Being and Consciousness\", \"Discourse on Being\", and after 1989 he published (among other things) \"The Originary\", \"Being and Ek-stasis\", \"The Making. A Treatise on Being\". Influenced by Hegel and by Sartre, his philosophy is an inquiry into the meaning of being, commencing with nothingness, in an attempt of rethinking both Hegel's \"Logic\" and Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\". He cultivates a deliberate literary expression, maintaining that the philosophical discourse must have two sides, one conceptually objective, the other subjective, aesthetic, persuasive. Lately, Corneliu Mircea seems close to some form of mystical philosophy.\n\nFollowing the examples of Anton Dumitriu, Grigore Moisil or Octav Onicescu, several teachers at the University of Bucharest oriented themselves toward epistemology and the philosophy of science, which due to its technical nature lacked ideological control and interference. After the demise of the communism, they continued their preoccupations, but also wrote on many other subjects. The protagonists of this school were Mircea Flonta (b. 1932), Ilie Parvu (b. 1941), Vasile Tonoiu (b. 1941), and Marin Turlea (b. 1940).\n\nMircea Flonta wrote a valuable monograph on the theme of the analytic/synthetic distinction in contemporary philosophy, and a study on the \"Philosophical Presuppositions of the Exact Sciences\". He can be considered the first analytical philosopher in Romania, understanding philosophy as a critical study of presuppositions. His activity continued after 1989 and diversified, as he approached such themes as the perception of philosophy in the Romanian culture. Among his perennial interests are the philosophy of Kant (he translated from Kant and wrote a book on him) and that of Wittgenstein (likewise, he translated several of his books and published a book on his philosophy).\n\nIlie Parvu is an epistemologist, philosopher of science, metaphysician and interpreter of Kant. His \"Introduction to Epistemology\" was the first book of this kind who had a European level, after the period in which the only epistemology was the Marxist–Leninist \"gnoseology\". It is still the best autochthon introduction available. His studies in the philosophy of science (\"The Scientific Theory\", \"The Semantics and the Logic of Science\") laid accent mostly on the contemporary formal instruments of analysis of the scientific theories. Parvu can be considered as belonging to the structuralist current in the philosophy of science, following J. Sneed, W. Stegmüller, C. U. Moulines, W. Balzer etc.\n\nThe structuralist analysis of theories was applied by Ilie Parvu in the domain of the reconstruction of some crucial philosophical works, like the \"Tractatus\" of Wittgenstein or the \"Critique of Pure Reason\".\n\nAs a metaphysician, Parvu published the two-volume \"The Architecture of Existence\". In the first volume he analyses the structural-generative paradigm in ontology. He conceives of an ontological theory as having an abstract-structural core, which generates its applications not by direct instantiation, but by restrictions and specialisations of this core, which evolves at the same time with the application. Professor Parvu analysed also the theories capable of furnishing decisive mediations between the structural abstraction of the nucleus and the world of empirical evidence. In the second volume he analysed the contemporary analytic metaphysics, the great ontological contemporary constructive programs, as that of Carnap or Quine, as well as diverse local metaphysics, like that of dispositions, powers, the ontologies of events, and different theories of the individual. He presented also important discussions concerning the metaontology, constructional apparatus, style and techniques in recent metaphysics.\n\nVasile Tonoiu was interested mostly in continental philosophy of science, translating Poincaré, Gonseth, Bachelard, and writing monographs on Gonseth and Bachelard. He also published a book on Morin's epistemological vision of complexity. Another chief interest of Tonoiu's is the dialogic philosophy, or the philosophy of dialogue. He wrote also an excellent book on Mircea Eliade, \"Archaic Ontologies in Actuality\".\n\nMarin Turlea dedicated his career to the philosophy of mathematics. His work on \"The Philosophy and the Foundations of Mathematics\" traces a distinction between the foundational and the foundationist research in mathematics, i.e. between mathematicians’ own research on its foundations, and the philosophical research of the foundations of the mathematics. In this book he soundly establishes the possibilities, sphere of action and relevance of the philosophical study of mathematics. Following the lines of the program indicated in this first work, Turlea will elaborate a \"Philosophy of Mathematics\", more like a history of the philosophical problems connected with systems of mathematics, from Plato and Proclus to \"Principia Mathematica\". He analyzes the metaphysics of mathematical entities in his \"Existence and Truth in Mathematics\", and he studies Wittgenstein's philosophy (or rather anti-philosophy) of mathematics.\n\nIn Romania Marxism did not produce any notable philosophers. The only Marxist philosopher of any importance born in Romania, Lucien Goldman, flourished in France. Within the mass of ideologists with philosophical pretensions, several figures detach though as honest philosophers.\n\nThis is the case of Athanase Joja (1904–1972), logician and interpreter of the ancient philosophy, with contributions to Marxist \"dialectical logic\". He founded the Romanian Academy's Institute of Logic, where many interbellic philosophers, including Noica, were reinserted professionally.\n\nAnother Marxist figure was Henri Wald (1920–2002), whose thinking was a mixture of French Structuralism and Marxism, and who wrote also an \"Introduction to the Dialectical Logic\".\n\nIon Ianoşi (b. 1928) is a Marxist philosopher from a different class, closer to literature, being for many years the secretary of the literary critique section of the Union of the Writers from Romania. He published a trilogy on the aesthetical category of the sublime, a volume on \"Hegel and the Art\" and many others, among which a study of the Romanian philosophy in its relation with literature, \"Philosophy and Literature\".\n\nAfter the Revolution from 1989, the philosophy in Romania began rapidly to synchronize with the Western contemporary philosophy.\n\nThus, phenomenology is represented especially by two groups, one from Cluj, with Virgil Ciomoş and Ion Copoeru as main characters, the other from Bucharest, developed as a consequence of Liiceanu's influence. This later group includes the editors of \"Studia Phaenomenologica\", Cristian Ciocan and Gabriel Cercel, and the Heideggerians like Catalin Cioaba or Bogdan Minca. Virgil Ciomoş published phenomenological interpretations of Aristotle and Kant, while Copoeru is a Husserlian scholar.\n\nPost-modernism in Romanian philosophy has as recent notable exponents such as Ciprian Mihali and Bogdan Ghiu. Although Mihali is more interested in the phenomenological analysis of the quotidian, his thinking is deeply rooted in French post-Structuralism. Ghiu, through his translations on Deleuze and various essays spread the influence of postmodern and poststructuralist French philosophy in Romania, although it remains rather subdued, without any mature philosophers.\n\nAnalytic philosophy has developed mostly at the University of Bucharest, by such names as Mircea Dumitru, Adrian-Paul Iliescu, Adrian Miroiu, Valentin Mureşan, Mihail-Radu Solcan. Mircea Dumitru wrote on philosophical logic, the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind. Iliescu is a political philosopher (liberalism and conservatism), but also has interests in the philosophy of language, publishing a book on Wittgenstein. Adrian Miroiu published works in the fields of modal logic, philosophy of science and political philosophy. More recently, after joining the National School of Political Science and Public Administration, he has moved to other fields which are intimately related to political science, such as social choice theory, rational choice theory, electoral competition, public policies and educational policies. Valentin Muresan works in the field of ethics, cultivating the philosophical commentary. He published commentaries of Plato, Aristotle, and Mill. Professor Solcan contributed to the development of the philosophy of mind in Romania, publishing an introduction to the philosophy of mind form the perspective of the cognitive sciences.\n\nA philosopher intellectually affiliated to the interbellic tradition, very close to the members of the Păltiniş school, who also attended some of Dragomir's seminars is Horia-Roman Patapievici. He was saluted by Liiceanu as a \"Romanian Kierkegaard\" for his first published essays, but later had to bear the unfair weight of this exaggerated remark. His most ambitious book to date is on \"The Recent Man, or What is lost when Something is won\". In this essay of cultural and political philosophy Patapievici develops a conservative critique of late modernity, of vast scope and unequal pertinence, making him however the most notable contemporary Romanian liberal-conservative thinker. More recently his thinking seems to have adopted some libertarian influences.\n\nProfessor Ștefan Aloroaei from the University of Iași is a specialist in hermeneutics. The books that made his reputation are \"The Negative Reason. Historico-symbolic Scenarios\" and \"How is Philosophy in Eastern Europe Possible?\". He published also \"Our Metaphysics of All Days\", where he tries to hermeneutically investigate the \"metaphysica naturalis\" implicit in the ordinary intercourse of the commonsense with the world.\n\nFinally, many university philosophers, mostly exponents of a continental style, continue the interbellic tradition of the Jack-of-all-trades philosophers, producing mostly works of history of the philosophy and of philosophical hermeneutics.\n\n\n"}

He was Vladimir Lenin's personal secretary. He was a brother of Mikhail Dmitriyevich Bonch-Bruyevich.\n\nVladimir Dmitriyevich Bonch-Bruyevich was born in Moscow to a land surveyor family who came from the Mogilev province and belonged to the nobility of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Between 1884–1889 he studied at the Moscow Institute of Surveying and graduated from the school of land surveying. He returned to Moscow in 1892 and entered the \"Moscow Workers' Union\" and distributed illegal literature. Since 1895 he was active in the social-democratic circles. In 1896 he emigrated to Switzerland and organized shipments of Russian revolutionary literature and printing equipment and became an active member of Iskra.\n\nOne of Bonch-Bruyevich's research interests were Russia's dissenting religious minorities (\"sects\"), which were usually persecuted to various extent by both the established Orthodox Church and the Tsarist government. In the late 1890s, he collaborated with Vladimir Chertkov and Leo Tolstoy, in particular in the arrangement of the Doukhobors' emigration to Canada in 1899. Bonch-Bruyevich sailed with the Doukhobors, and spent a year with them in Canada. During that time, he was able to record much of their orally transmitted tradition, in particular the Doukhobor \"psalms\" (hymns). He published them later (1909) as \"The Doukhobor Book of Life\" (, \"Zhivotnaya Kniga Dukhobortsev\").\n\nBetween 1903–1905 he was the head of the expedition of the Central Committee of the RSDLP (Geneva) and one of the founders of the archive.

From 1918 he was Deputy Chairman of the Board of Medical Colleges. In 1919 he was Chairman of the Committee for the construction of sanitary checkpoints at railway stations in Moscow and the Special Committee for Rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation in Moscow.

In addition to hands-on management, the affiliates identify, develop, and manage projects, negotiate local partnerships, and attract local support to complement funds provided by donors.\n\nWMF describes its mission as \"to preserve important historic architectural sites and works of art without regard to national boundaries\".\n\nThe \"International Fund for Monuments\" (IFM) was an organization created by Colonel James A. Gray (1909-1994) after his retirement from the U.S. Army in 1960. Gray had conceived of a visionary project to arrest the settlement of the Leaning Tower of Pisa by freezing the soil underneath, and formed the organization in 1965 as a vehicle for the implementation of this idea. Even though this project did not materialize, an opportunity arose for the young organization to participate in the conservation of the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela in Ethiopia. In 1966 Gray secured the support of philanthropist Lila Acheson Wallace (1889-1984), who offered $150,000 to the \"International Fund for Monuments\" and UNESCO for this project. The project continued until the Communist overthrow of Haile Selassie I and the subsequent expulsion of foreigners from Ethiopia. After Ethiopia, Gray's interests shifted to Easter Island (Rapa Nui) in Chile. Gray formed the \"Easter Island Committee\", with Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl (1914–2002) as its honorary chairman. Gray arranged to have one of the monolithic human figures known as \"moai\" exhibited in the United States. With the help of anthropologist William Mulloy (1917-1978), Gray selected an , five-ton head, which was exhibited in front of the Seagram Building in New York and in the Pan American Union building in Washington, D.C.\nAn important chapter for the organization started with its involvement in the broad international effort led by UNESCO for the protection of the city of Venice, Italy from catastrophic flooding. After the extremely high tide of 4 November 1966, the city, including the historic Piazza San Marco, was inundated for more than twenty-four hours. The \"International Fund for Monuments\" set up a \"Venice Committee\", with Professor John McAndrew (1904-1978) of Wellesley College as chairman and Gray as executive secretary. On the part of the Committee, appeals were made to the American public, and local chapters set up in American cities. This early initiative led to the formation of the independent organization Save Venice in 1971. These efforts helped establish a reputation for IFM. In Spain, the organization formed a \"Committee for Spain\" under the leadership of American diplomat and U.S. Ambassador to Spain in 1965-67 Angier Biddle Duke (1915-1995).\n\nAt the invitation of UNESCO in the 1970s IFM became involved in architectural conservation in Nepal, where the organization adopted the Mahadev temple complex in Gokarna, in Nepal's Kathmandu Valley. The 14th-century temple building was surveyed, rotten timbers were replaced, and the foundations were strengthened. Sculpted wooden architectural elements were painstakingly cleaned of layers of a motor oil coating that had been applied annually for protection.\n\nAlso at the request of UNESCO, IFM launched a project for the preservation of the Citadelle Laferrière, a large mountaintop fortress near Milot, Haiti. The site was the keystone of a defensive system constructed in the early period of Haitian independence to protect the young state from French attempts to reclaim it as a colony. Local artisans reconstructed wooden and tile roofs over the grand gallery and batteries using traditional carpentry methods, and consolidated the stone galleries of the fortress. IFM also sponsored a traveling exhibition and a film about the history of the \"Citadelle\", which was used for educational purposes in the United States.\n\nThrough donations and matching funds, WMF has worked with local community and government partners worldwide to safeguard and conserve places of historic value for future generations. To date, WMF has worked at more than 500 sites in 91 countries, including many UNESCO World Heritage Sites. WMF has worked at internationally famous tourist attractions as well as lesser-known sites. Highly prominent projects are many temples at Angkor, Cambodia, starting in 1990, including Preah Khan and Phnom Bakheng; the Château de Chantilly in Chantilly, France; the ghost town of Craco, Italy; many structures in Rome, including the Temple of Hercules, Santa Maria Antiqua, and the House of Augustus; several sites on Easter Island; various sites at ancient Luxor in Egypt; Lalibela in Ethiopia; San Ignacio Miní in Argentina; the ancient Maya city of Naranjo, Guatemala; the Segovia Aqueduct in Segovia, Spain; as well as 25 projects in Venice, Italy, over 20 years. WMF has also participated in projects in the United States, including Ellis Island, Taos Pueblo, Mesa Verde National Park, the Mount Lebanon Shaker Society, and many sites in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.\n\nEvery two years WMF publishes the \"World Monuments Watch\" (formerly the \"World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites\"). Since the first list was compiled in 1996, this program has drawn international attention to cultural heritage sites around the world threatened by neglect, vandalism, armed conflict, commercial development, natural disasters, and climate change. Through the \"World Monuments Watch\", WMF fosters community support for the protection of endangered sites, and attracts technical and financial support for the sites.\n\nThe sites are nominated by international and local preservation groups and professionals, including local authorities. Sites of all types, including secular and religious architecture, archaeological sites, landscapes and townscapes, and dating from all time periods, from ancient to contemporary, are eligible. An independent panel of international experts reviews and selects the sites that make up the list. In 2010 the panelists were Christina Cameron, Alfredo Conti, Pierre-André Lablaude, Jeanne Marie Teutonico, and Christopher Young.\n\nWMF also operates a number of special initiatives that transcend individual projects at specific sites and address broader themes in heritage preservation.\n\nFollowing the Iraq War WMF created the \"Iraq Cultural Heritage Conservation Initiative\" to address the many threats to Iraq’s cultural heritage resulting from the occupation and from a long period of political isolation and conflict. At the ancient city of Babylon WMF has launched a program with the support of the United States Department of State to develop a comprehensive site management plan, help local officials prepare a nomination for World Heritage listing, and establish site boundaries for the long-term protection of the ancient city.\n\nIn 2006, with the support of Knoll, WMF launched \"Modernism at Risk\", an advocacy and conservation program for Modernist architecture. Through this initiative, the biennial \"World Monuments Fund / Knoll Modernism Prize\" was established in 2008. The inaugural prize was awarded to Brenne Gesellschaft von Architekten mbH for the restoration of the former ADGB Trade Union School, an important Bauhaus structure in Bernau bei Berlin, Germany. The 2010 prize was awarded to Bierman Henket Architecten and Wessel de Jonge Architecten for the restoration of the Zonnestraal Sanatorium, an aftercare colony for tubercular patients near Hilversum, in the Netherlands, built in 1931. The 2012 prize was awarded to the Architectural Consortium for Hizuchi Elementary School for the restoration of Hizuchi Elementary School in Hizuchi, Yawatahama City, Ehime Prefecture, Japan.\n\n\nEvery year, WMF presents the \"Hadrian Award\" to international leaders who have advanced the preservation of world art and architecture at its annual benefit dinner.\n\n\nSome of WMF's long-term partners have included American Express, Knoll, the Robert W. Wilson Challenge to Conserve Our Heritage, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, and Tiffany & Co. The Samuel H. Kress Foundation's relationship with the organization dates almost to the inception of the \"International Fund for Monuments\".\n\nIn 2009, WMF agreed to share approximately 2,000 images of architecture, sites, and monuments from around the world to be made available by ARTstor.\n\nWMF has partnered with The Williamsburg High School for Architecture and Design, the only high school in the United States with a four-year comprehensive historic preservation curriculum.\n\n"}
