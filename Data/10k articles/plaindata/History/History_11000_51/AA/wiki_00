{"id": "18880184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18880184", "title": "Ancient Egyptian race controversy", "text": "Ancient Egyptian race controversy\n\nThe question of the race of ancient Egyptians was raised historically as a product of the early racial concepts of the 18th and 19th centuries, and was linked to models of racial hierarchy primarily based on craniometry, anthropometry and genetics. A variety of views circulated about the racial identity of the Egyptians and the source of their culture. These were typically identified in terms of a distinction between the Caucasoid and Negroid racial categories. Some scholars argued that ancient Egyptian culture was influenced by other Afroasiatic-speaking populations in Northeast Africa, the Maghreb, or the Middle East, while others pointed to influences from various Nubian groups or populations in Europe.\n\nMainstream scholars reject the notion that Egypt was a white or black civilization; they maintain that, despite the phenotypic diversity of Ancient and present day Egyptians, applying modern notions of black or white races to ancient Egypt is anachronistic. In addition, scholars reject the notion, implicit in the notion of a black or white Egypt hypothesis, that Ancient Egypt was racially homogeneous; instead, skin color varied between the peoples of Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Nubia, who in various eras rose to power in Ancient Egypt.\n\nIn the last few years, the first credible, peer-reviewed genetic studies on Ancient Egyptians have been conducted, which show that a small but significant and consistent percentage of Ancient Egyptian ancestry came from sub-Saharan Africa. This ancestry is lowest in northern Egypt, and becomes increasingly large as one proceeds south through the populations of Middle and Upper (southern) Egypt. A 2017 genetic study of 83 mummies from northern Egypt (buried near modern-day Cairo), which constituted \"the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods,\" showed that these persons were most closely related to the diverse modern populations of what is now the Arab world, particularly the southern Levant and Arabia, while also indicating smaller affinities to the neighboring southeastern European and sub-Saharan African (Nubian) populations. Though the mummies were much more closely related to Arab populations than European, they were actually slightly more closely related to southeastern Europeans than modern Egyptians, a fact publicized in the press coverage of the study; the genetic distance between Ancient and modern Egyptians reflects the much greater level of sub-Saharan African ancestry in modern Egyptians, who are heavily mixed with sub-Saharan Africans, and may also stem from a faulty comparison on the part of the study's authors, who compared Lower (northern) Egyptian mummies to the average genetic composition of all contemporary Egyptians (from both Upper and Lower Egypt). \n\nNevertheless, all 83 mummies tested had significant levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry, although this ancestry was relatively distant. Specifically, the mummies contained between 6% and 15% sub-Saharan African ancestry, with this component getting increasingly large in the later eras of Ancient Egypt. The study's authors noted that this is much less than the percentage of sub-Saharan African ancestry in modern Egyptians, and emphasized the genetic distance between modern and Ancient Egyptians. The authors also cautioned that their findings might be unrepresentative of Ancient Egypt as a whole, anticipating that mummies from Upper (southern) Egypt would contain considerably greater levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry than the Lower Egyptian mummies they examined, and calling for more future research on the matter.\n\nThe earliest examples of disagreement regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians occurred in the work of Europeans and Americans early in the 19th century. One early example of such an attempt was an article published in \"The New-England Magazine\" of October 1833, where the authors dispute a claim that \"Herodotus was given as authority for their being negroes.\" They point out with reference to tomb paintings: \"It may be observed that the complexion of the men is invariably red, that of the women yellow; but neither of them can be said to have anything in their physiognomy at all resembling the Negro countenance.\"\n\nIn the 18th century, Constantin François de Chassebœuf, comte de Volney, wrote \"The Copts are the proper representatives of the Ancient Egyptians\" due to their \"jaundiced and fumed skin, which is neither Greek, Negro nor Arab, their full faces, their puffy eyes, their crushed noses, and their thick lips ... the ancient Egyptians were true negroes of the same type as all native born Africans\".\n\nJust a few years later, in 1839, Jean-François Champollion stated in his work \"Egypte Ancienne\" that the Egyptians and Nubians are represented in the same manner in tomb paintings and reliefs, further suggesting that: \"In the Copts of Egypt, we do not find any of the characteristic features of the ancient Egyptian population. The Copts are the result of crossbreeding with all the nations that successfully dominated Egypt. It is wrong to seek in them the principal features of the old race.\" Also in 1839, Champollion's and Volney's claims were disputed by Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac, who blamed the ancients for spreading a false impression of a Negro Egypt, stating \"The opinion that the ancient population of Egypt belonged to the Negro African race, is an error long accepted as the truth. ... Volney's conclusion as to the Negro origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization is evidently forced and inadmissible.\"\n\nThe debate over the race of the ancient Egyptians intensified during the 19th century movement to abolish slavery in the United States, as arguments relating to the justifications for slavery increasingly asserted the historical, mental and physical inferiority of black people. For example, in 1851, John Campbell directly challenged the claims by Champollion and others regarding the evidence for a black Egypt, asserting \"There is one great difficulty, and to my mind an insurmountable one, which is that the advocates of the negro civilization of Egypt do not attempt to account for, how this civilization was lost... Egypt progressed, and why, because it was Caucasian.\" The arguments regarding the race of the Egyptians became more explicitly tied to the debate over slavery in the United States as the United States escalated towards civil war. In 1854, Josiah C. Nott with George Glidden set out to prove: \"that the Caucasian or white, and the Negro races were distinct at a very remote date, and \"that the Egyptians were Caucasians.\"\" Samuel George Morton, a physician and professor of anatomy, concluded that although \"Negroes were numerous in Egypt, but their social position in ancient times was the same that it now is [in the United States], that of servants and slaves.\" In the early 20th century, Flinders Petrie, a Professor of Egyptology at the University of London, in turn spoke of a Nubian queen, Aohmes Nefertari, who was the \"divine ancestress of the XVIIIth dynasty\". He described her physically as having \"had an aquiline nose, long and thin, and was of a type not in the least prognathous\".\n\nEgypt was not a popular civilization with all African Americans at the time, because they often associated Egypt with slavery. Black spirituals such as Go Down Moses related the slavery of blacks in America to the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt. As late as the 1960s, Martin Luther King and other civil rights leaders related the struggles of the Jews enslaved in Egypt to the struggles of African Americans.\n\nModern scholars who have studied ancient Egyptian culture and population history have responded to the controversy over the race of the ancient Egyptians in different ways.\n\nAt the UNESCO \"Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script\" in Cairo in 1974, the Black Hypothesis met with \"profound\" disagreement. Most participants concluded that the ancient Egyptian population was indigenous to the Nile Valley, and was made up of people from north and south of the Sahara who were differentiated by their color. The arguments for all sides are recorded in the UNESCO publication \"General History of Africa\", with the \"Origin of the Egyptians\" chapter being written by Cheikh Anta Diop.\n\nSince the second half of the 20th century, most anthropologists have rejected the notion of race as having any validity in the study of human biology. Stuart Tyson Smith writes in the 2001 \"Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt\", \"Any characterization of race of the ancient Egyptians depends on modern cultural definitions, not on scientific study. Thus, by modern American standards it is reasonable to characterize the Egyptians as 'black', while acknowledging the scientific evidence for the physical diversity of Africans.\" Frank M. Snowden asserts \"Egyptians, Greeks and Romans attached no special stigma to the colour of the skin and developed no hierarchical notions of race whereby highest and lowest positions in the social pyramid were based on colour.\"\n\nIn 1975, the mummy of Ramesses II was taken to France for preservation. The mummy was also forensically tested by Professor Pierre-Fernand Ceccaldi, the chief forensic scientist at the Criminal Identification Laboratory of Paris, who wrote: \"Hair, astonishingly preserved, showed some complementary data - especially about pigmentation: Ramses II was a Red haired cymnotriche leucoderma\", that is a fair-skinned person with wavy red hair.\n\nIt is now largely agreed that Dynastic Egyptians were indigenous to the Nile area. About 5,000 years ago, the Sahara area dried out, and part of the indigenous Saharan population retreated east towards the Nile Valley. In addition, peoples from the Middle East entered the Nile Valley, bringing with them wheat, barley, sheep, goats, and possibly cattle. Dynastic Egyptians referred to their country as \"The Two Lands\". During the Predynastic period (about 4800 to 4300BC), the Merimde culture flourished in the northern part of Egypt (Lower Egypt). This culture, among others, has links to the Levant in the Middle East. The pottery of the later Buto Maadi culture, best known from the site at Maadi near Cairo, also shows connections to the southern Levant. In the southern part of Egypt (Upper Egypt), the predynastic Badarian culture was followed by the Naqada culture. These people seem to be more closely related to the Nubians than to northern Egyptians.\n\nAn examination of ancient Egyptian skeletons and skulls in 2007 also suggests that there was in-migration to the Abydos region of the Nile Valley, particularly during the Early Dynastic Period and the Old Kingdom.\n\nA study by published in 2017 described the extraction and analysis of DNA from 151 mummified ancient Egyptian individuals, whose remains were recovered from Abusir el-Meleq in the Cairo Governate. The scientists said that obtaining well-preserved, uncontaminated DNA from mummies has been a problem for the field and that these samples provided \"the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods\". The study showed that Ancient Egyptians had the greatest affinity for modern Middle Eastern (Arab, Levantine and Anatolian) populations, and had significantly more affinity with southeastern Europeans than with sub-Saharan Africans. Nevertheless, there was a significant sub-Saharan African component in the ancestry of each mummy: \"absolute estimates of African ancestry using these two methods in the three ancient individuals range from 6 to 15%.\" This level of sub-Saharan African ancestry is significantly lower than that of modern Egyptians from Abusir, who \"range from 14 to 21%.\" \n\nThe study's authors cautioned that the mummies may be unrepresentative of the Ancient Egyptian population as a whole, since they were recovered from the northern part of Egypt, and contemporary genetic studies show much greater levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry in the current-day populations of southern as opposed to \nnorthern Egypt.\n\nToday the issues regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians are \"troubled waters which most people who write about ancient Egypt from within the mainstream of scholarship avoid.\" The debate, therefore, takes place mainly in the public sphere and tends to focus on a small number of specific issues.\n\nSeveral Afrocentric scholars, including Diop, have claimed that Tutankhamun was black, and have protested that attempted reconstructions of Tutankhamun's facial features (as depicted on the cover of \"National Geographic\" magazine) have represented the king as \"too white\". Among these writers was Chancellor Williams, who argued that King Tutankhamun, his parents, and grandparents were black.\n\nForensic artists and physical anthropologists from Egypt, France, and the United States independently created busts of Tutankhamun, using a CT-scan of the skull. Biological anthropologist Susan Anton, the leader of the American team, said the race of the skull was \"hard to call\". She stated that the shape of the cranial cavity indicated an African, while the nose opening suggested narrow nostrils, which is usually considered to be a European characteristic. The skull was thus concluded to be that of a North African. Other experts have argued that neither skull shapes nor nasal openings are a reliable indication of race.\n\nAlthough modern technology can reconstruct Tutankhamun's facial structure with a high degree of accuracy, based on CT data from his mummy, determining his skin tone and eye color is impossible. The clay model was therefore given a coloring, which, according to the artist, was based on an \"average shade of modern Egyptians\".\n\nTerry Garcia, \"National Geographic\"s executive vice president for mission programs, said, in response to some of those protesting against the Tutankhamun reconstruction: \"The big variable is skin tone. North Africans, we know today, had a range of skin tones, from light to dark. In this case, we selected a medium skin tone, and we say, quite up front, 'This is midrange.' We will never know for sure what his exact skin tone was or the color of his eyes with 100% certainty... Maybe in the future, people will come to a different conclusion.\"\n\nWhen pressed on the issue by American activists in September 2007, the Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, Zahi Hawass stated \"Tutankhamun was not black.\"\n\nIn a November 2007 publication of \"Ancient Egypt\" magazine, Hawass asserted that none of the facial reconstructions resemble Tut and that, in his opinion, the most accurate representation of the boy king is the mask from his tomb. The Discovery Channel commissioned a facial reconstruction of Tutankhamun, based on CT scans of a model of his skull, back in 2002.\n\nIn 2011, the genomics company iGENEA launched a Tutankhamun DNA project based on genetic markers that it indicated it had culled from a Discovery Channel special on the pharaoh. According to the firm, the microsatellite data suggested that Tutankhamun belonged to the haplogroup R1b1a2, the most common paternal clade among males in Western Europe. Carsten Pusch and Albert Zink, who led the unit that had extracted Tutankhamun's DNA, chided iGENEA for not liaising with them before establishing the project. After examining the footage, they also concluded that the methodology the company used was unscientific.\n\nThe race and skin color of Cleopatra VII, the last active ruler of the Macedonian Greek Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, established in 323 BCE, has also caused frequent debate. For example, the article \"Was Cleopatra Black?\" was published in \"Ebony\" magazine in 2012, and an article about Afrocentrism from the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" mentions the question, too. Scholars generally identify Cleopatra as of Greek ancestry with some Persian and Syrian ancestry, based on the fact that her Macedonian Greek family (the Ptolemaic dynasty) had intermingled with the Seleucid aristocracy of the time (notably including the first Cleopatra, Queen Cleopatra I Syra, wife of Ptolemy V of Egypt). While her mother's identity is uncertain, she is generally believed to be Cleopatra V of Egypt, the sister or cousin wife of Ptolemy XII Auletes, who was the daughter of Ptolemy IX or Ptolemy X. Additionally, while the identity of her paternal grandmother isn't certain, it is generally believed to be Cleopatra IV, via Ptolemy XII's father, Ptolemy IX Lathyros, or a Greek Alexandrian woman.\n\nDiana Preston proposes that Cleopatra's paternal grandmother may have been part Syrian, in line with the precedent of Persian and Syrian blood in the Ptolemaic line, continuing that Cleopatra \"almost certainly had olive skin and dark eyes.\" Michael Grant also argues that Cleopatra's paternal grandmother may have been mixed Syrian and Greek, continuing that \"certainly she was not an Egyptian,\" noting there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemaic king. He goes on to say Cleopatra probably had not a drop of Egyptian blood and that she \"would have described herself as Greek,\" adding that if Cleopatra had been illegitimate her \"numerous Roman enemies would have revealed this to the world.\" Adrian Goldsworthy notes Cleopatra, having Macedonian blood with a little Syrian, was probably not dark skinned (he also notes Roman propaganda never mentions it), contending \"fairer skin is marginally more likely considering her ancestry,\" and that she \"was no more Egyptian culturally or ethnically than most residents of modern day Arizona are Apaches.\" He further stresses that Cleopatra's native tongue was Greek, that it was in \"Greek literature and culture she that was educated,\" that her worship of Isis was \"strongly Hellenised,\" and that although she was presented in some statuary in the idealized Egyptian style, she was unlikely to have dressed like this outside of performing certain rites; instead Cleopatra \"wore the headband and robes of a Greek monarch.\" Stacy Schiff concurs, Cleopatra was not dark-skinned, that \"the Ptolemies were in fact Macedonian Greek, which makes Cleopatra approximately as Egyptian as Elizabeth Taylor\", that her Ptolemaic relatives were described as \"honey skinned\", that she was part Persian, and that \"an Egyptian mistress is a rarity among the Ptolemies.\" (Additionally, it interesting to note that Cleopatra's son with Mark Antony, Alexander Helios, was engaged to a Persian princess, further cementing the surmountable proof of the closeness of the Ptolemaic dynasty to the Persian nobility.) \n\nSchiff continues that Cleopatra \"faithfully held up the family tradition.\" In essence, Cleopatra's loyalties were to her Ptolemaic Greek heritage. As noted by Donald R. Dudley, Cleopatra and her family were \"the successor[s] to the native Pharaohs, exploiting through a highly organized bureaucracy the great natural resources of the Nile Valley.\" Cleopatra's official coinage (which she would have approved) and the three portrait busts of her considered authentic by scholars (which match her coins) portray Cleopatra as a Greek woman in style, including a Hellenistic diadem and Greek chignon. Francisco Pina Polo writes that Cleopatra's coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the \"\" head is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun, a diadem, and a hooked nose. Ernle Bradford writes that it is \"reasonable to infer\" Cleopatra had dark hair and \"pale olive skin\" by how she portrays herself as a \"Eastern Mediterranean type\" on her official coins, and that she challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman, \"but as a civilized Greek.\"\n\nThe question was the subject of a heated exchange between Mary Lefkowitz, who has referred in her articles to a debate she had with one of her students about the question of whether Cleopatra was black, and Molefi Kete Asante, Professor of African American Studies at Temple University. In response to \"Not Out of Africa\" by Lefkowitz, Asante wrote the article \"Race in Antiquity: Truly Out of Africa\", in which he emphasized that he \"can say without a doubt that Afrocentrists do not spend time arguing that either Socrates or Cleopatra were black.\"\n\nIn 2009, a BBC documentary speculated that Arsinoe IV, the half-sister of Cleopatra VII, may have been part North African and then further speculated that Cleopatra's mother, thus Cleopatra herself, might also have been part North African. This was based largely on the claims of Hilke Thür of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, who in the 1990s had examined a headless skeleton of a female child in a 20 BC tomb in Ephesus (modern Turkey), together with the old notes and photographs of the now-missing skull. She hypothesized the body as that of Arsinoe. Arsinoe and Cleopatra, shared the same father (Ptolemy XII Auletes) but had different mothers. However, researchers Clarence C. Gravlee, H. Russell Bernard, and William R. Leonard, and others have demonstrated that skull measurements are not a reliable indicator of race and it has never been definitively proved the skeleton is that of Arsinoe IV. Furthermore, when a DNA test that attempted to determine the identity of the child, it was impossible to get an accurate reading since the bones had been handled too many times, and the skull had been lost in Germany during World War II. Mary Beard wrote a dissenting essay criticizing the findings, pointing out that one, there is no surviving name on the tomb and that the claim the tomb is alleged to invoke the shape of the Pharos Lighthouse \"doesn't add up\"; second, the skull doesn't survive intact and the age of the skeleton is too young to be that of Arsinoe's (the bones said to be that of a 15-18 year old child, with Arsinoe being around her mid twenties at her death); and thirdly, since Cleopatra and Arsinoe were not known to have the same mother, \"the ethnic argument goes largely out of the window.\" \n\nThe identity of the model for the Great Sphinx of Giza is unknown. Virtually all Egyptologists and scholars currently believe that the face of the Sphinx represents the likeness of the Pharaoh Khafra, although a few Egyptologists and interested amateurs have proposed several different hypotheses.\n\nNumerous Afrocentric scholars, such as Du Bois, Diop, and Asante have characterized the face of the Sphinx as Black, or \"Negroid\". Another early description of a \"Negroid\" Sphinx is recorded in the travel notes of a French scholar, who visited in Egypt between 1783 and 1785, Volney along with French novelist Gustave Flaubert.\n\nAmerican geologist Robert M. Schoch has written that the \"Sphinx has a distinctive African, Nubian, or Negroid aspect which is lacking in the face of Khafre\".\n\nAncient Egyptians referred to their homeland as \"Kmt\" (conventionally pronounced as \"Kemet\"). According to Cheikh Anta Diop, the Egyptians referred to themselves as \"Black\" people or \"kmt\", and \"km\" was the etymological root of other words, such as Kam or Ham, which refer to Black people in Hebrew tradition. A review of David Goldenberg's \"The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity and Islam\" states that Goldenberg \"argues persuasively that the biblical name Ham bears no relationship at all to the notion of blackness and as of now is of unknown etymology\". Diop, William Leo Hansberry, and Aboubacry Moussa Lam have argued that \"kmt\" was derived from the skin color of the Nile valley people, which Diop claimed was black. The claim that the ancient Egyptians had black skin has become a cornerstone of Afrocentric historiography.\n\nMainstream scholars hold that \"kmt\" means \"the black land\" or \"the black place\", and that this is a reference to the fertile black soil that was washed down from Central Africa by the annual Nile inundation. By contrast the barren desert outside the narrow confines of the Nile watercourse was called \"dšrt\" (conventionally pronounced \"deshret\") or \"the red land\". Raymond Faulkner's \"Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian\" translates \"kmt\" into \"Egyptians\", Gardiner translates it as \"the Black Land, Egypt\".\n\nAt the UNESCO Symposium in 1974, Sauneron, Obenga, and Diop concluded that KMT and KM meant black. However, Sauneron clarified that the adjective \"Kmtyw\" means \"people of the black land\" rather than \"black people\", and that the Egyptians never used the adjective \"Kmtyw\" to refer to the various black peoples they knew of, they only used it to refer to themselves.\n\nAncient Egyptian tombs and temples contained thousands of paintings, sculptures, and written works, which reveal a great deal about the people of that time. However, their depictions of themselves in their surviving art and artifacts are rendered in sometimes symbolic, rather than realistic, pigments. As a result, ancient Egyptian artifacts provide sometimes conflicting and inconclusive evidence of the ethnicity of the people who lived in Egypt during dynastic times.\n\nIn 1839, Champollion states in his work \"Egypte Ancienne\" that the Egyptians and Nubians are represented in the same manner in tomb paintings and reliefs. University of Chicago scholars assert that Nubians are generally depicted with black paint, but the skin pigment used in Egyptian paintings to refer to Nubians can range \"from dark red to brown to black\". This can be observed in paintings from the tomb of the Egyptian Huy, as well as Ramses II's temple at Beit el-Wali. Also, Snowden indicates that Romans had accurate knowledge of \"negroes of a red, copper-colored complexion ... among African tribes\". Conversely, Najovits states \"Egyptian art depicted Egyptians on the one hand and Nubians and other blacks on the other hand with distinctly different ethnic characteristics and depicted this abundantly and often aggressively. The Egyptians accurately, arrogantly and aggressively made national and ethnic distinctions from a very early date in their art and literature.\" He continues, \"There is an extraordinary abundance of Egyptian works of art which clearly depicted sharply contrasted reddish-brown Egyptians and black Nubians.\"\n\nHowever, Manu Ampim, a professor at Merritt College specializing in African and African American history and culture, claims in the book \"Modern Fraud: The Forged Ancient Egyptian Statues of Ra-Hotep and Nofret,\" that many ancient Egyptian statues and artworks are modern frauds that have been created specifically to hide the \"fact\" that the ancient Egyptians were black, while authentic artworks that demonstrate black characteristics are systematically defaced or even \"modified\". Ampim repeatedly makes the accusation that the Egyptian authorities are systematically destroying evidence that \"proves\" that the ancient Egyptians were black, under the guise of renovating and conserving the applicable temples and structures. He further accuses \"European\" scholars of wittingly participating in and abetting this process.\nAmpim has a specific concern about the painting of the \"Table of Nations\" in the Tomb of Ramses III (KV11). The \"Table of Nations\" is a standard painting that appears in a number of tombs, and they were usually provided for the guidance of the soul of the deceased. Among other things, it described the \"four races of men\" as follows: (translation by E.A. Wallis Budge: \"The first are RETH, the second are AAMU, the third are NEHESU, and the fourth are THEMEHU. The RETH are Egyptians, the AAMU are dwellers in the deserts to the east and north-east of Egypt, the NEHESU are the black races, and the THEMEHU are the fair-skinned Libyans.\"\n\nThe archaeologist Richard Lepsius documented many ancient Egyptian tomb paintings in his work \"Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien.\" In 1913, after the death of Lepsius, an updated reprint of the work was produced, edited by Kurt Sethe. This printing included an additional section, called the \"Ergänzungsband\" in German, which incorporated many illustrations that did not appear in Lepsius's original work. One of them, plate 48, illustrated one example of each of the four \"nations\" as depicted in KV11, and shows the \"Egyptian nation\" and the \"Nubian nation\" as identical to each other in skin color and dress. Professor Ampim has declared that plate 48 is a true reflection of the original painting, and that it \"proves\" that the ancient Egyptians were identical in appearance to the Nubians, even though he admits no other examples of the \"Table of Nations\" show this similarity. He has further accused \"Euro-American writers\" of attempting to mislead the public on this issue.\n\nThe late Egyptologist, Frank Yurco, visited the tomb of Ramses III (KV11), and in a 1996 article on the Ramses III tomb reliefs he pointed out that the depiction of plate 48 in the Ergänzungsband section is not a correct depiction of what is actually painted on the walls of the tomb. Yurco notes, instead, that plate 48 is a \"pastiche\" of samples of what is on the tomb walls, arranged from Lepsius's notes after his death, and that a picture of a Nubian person has erroneously been labeled in the pastiche as an Egyptian person. Yurco points also to the much more recent photographs of Dr. Erik Hornung as a correct depiction of the actual paintings. (Erik Hornung, \"The Valley of the Kings: Horizon of Eternity\", 1990). Ampim nonetheless continues to claim that plate 48 shows accurately the images that stand on the walls of KV11, and he categorically accuses both Yurco and Hornung of perpetrating a deliberate deception for the purposes of misleading the public about the true race of the ancient Egyptians.\n\nThe Black Egyptian hypothesis is held by various authors that ancient Egypt was indigenous to Africa and a Black civilization. This includes a particular focus on links to Sub Saharan cultures and the questioning of the race of specific notable individuals from Dynastic times, including Tutankhamun and the king represented in the Great Sphinx of Giza, and Greek Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra. Since the second half of the 20th century, typological and hierarchical models of race have increasingly been rejected by scientists, and most scholars have held that applying modern notions of race to ancient Egypt is anachronistic.\n\nEarly advocates of the Black African model relied heavily on writings from Classical Greek historians, including Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Herodotus, wherein the Greeks referred to Egyptians as \"melanchroes\" with woolly hair. The translation of the Greek word \"melanchroes\" is disputed, being translated either as \"black\" or \"dark skinned\". Snowden claims that Diop is distorting his classical sources and is quoting them selectively. There is dispute about the historical accuracy of the works of Herodotus – some scholars support the reliability of Herodotus while other scholars regard his works as being unreliable as historical sources, particularly those relating to Egypt.\n\nOther points used to support the Black Hypothesis included testing melanin levels in a small sample of mummies, arguing that the ancient Egyptian language was related to Diop's native Wolof (Senegal), interpretations of the origin of the name \"Kmt\", conventionally pronounced \"Kemet\", used by the ancient Egyptians to describe themselves or their land (depending on points of view), biblical traditions, and interpretations of the depictions of the Egyptians in numerous paintings and statues. Other points of the hypothesis include claimed cultural affiliations, such as circumcision, matriarchy, totemism, hair braiding, head binding, and kingship cults. Artifacts found at Qustul (near Abu Simbel – Modern Sudan) in 1960–64 were seen as showing that ancient Egypt and A-group Nubia shared the same culture and were part of the greater Nile Valley sub-stratum, but more recent finds in Egypt indicate that the Qustul rulers probably adopted/emulated the symbols of Egyptian pharaohs.\n\nAt the UNESCO \"Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic script\" in Cairo in 1974, the Black Hypothesis met with \"profound\" disagreement. Most participants concluded that the ancient Egyptian population was indigenous to the Nile Valley, and was made up of people from north and south of the Sahara who were differentiated by their color. The current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development (see population history of Egypt).\n\nThe Asiatic race theory holds that the ancient Egyptians were the lineal descendants of the biblical Ham, through his son Mizraim. This theory was the most dominant view from the Early Middle Ages (c. 500 AD) all the way up to the early 19th century. The descendants of Ham were traditionally considered to be the darkest-skinned branch of humanity, either because of their geographic allotment to Africa or because of the Curse of Ham. Thus, Diop cites Gaston Maspero \"Moreover, the Bible states that Mesraim, son of Ham. brother of Chus (Kush) ... and of Canaan, came from Mesopotamia to settle with his children on the banks of the Nile.\"\n\nBy the 20th century, the Asiatic race theory and its various offshoots were abandoned but were superseded by two related theories: the eurocentric Hamitic hypothesis, asserting that a Caucasian racial group moved into North and East Africa from early prehistory subsequently bringing with them all advanced agriculture, technology and civilization, and the Dynastic race theory, proposing that Mesopotamian invaders were responsible for the dynastic civilization of Egypt (c. 3000 BC). In sharp contrast to the Asiatic race theory, neither of these theories proposes that Caucasians were the indigenous inhabitants of Egypt.\n\nIn 1844, Samuel George Morton wrote that the Nile valley \"was originally peopled by a branch of the Caucasian race\", and acknowledged that Negroes were present in ancient Egypt but claimed they were either captives or servants. George Gliddon (1844) wrote: \"The Egyptians were white men, of no darker hue than a pure Arab, a Jew, or a Phoenician.\"\n\nThe similar Hamitic hypothesis, which developed directly from the Asiatic Race Theory, argued that the Ethiopid and Arabid populations of the Horn of Africa were the inventors of agriculture and had brought all civilization to Africa, and asserted that these people were Caucasians, not Negroid. It also rejected any Biblical basis despite using Hamitic as the theory's name. Charles Gabriel Seligman in his \"Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan\" (1913) and later works argued that the ancient Egyptians were among this group of Caucasian Hamites, having arrived in the Nile Valley during early prehistory and introduced technology and agriculture to primitive natives they found there.\n\nThe Italian anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi (1901) believed that ancient Egyptians were the Eastern African (Hamitic) branch of the Mediterranean race, which he called \"Eurafrican\". According to Sergi, the Mediterranean race or \"Eurafrican\" contains three varieties or sub-races: the African (Hamitic) branch, the Mediterranean \"proper\" branch and the Nordic (depigmentated) branch. Sergi maintained in summary that the Mediterranean race (excluding the depigmentated Nordic or 'white') is: \"a brown human variety, neither white nor Negroid, but pure in its elements, that is to say not a product of the mixture of Whites with Negroes or Negroid peoples\". Grafton Elliot Smith modified the theory in 1911, stating that the ancient Egyptians were a dark haired \"brown race\", most closely \"linked by the closest bonds of racial affinity to the Early Neolithic populations of the North African littoral and South Europe\", and not Negroid. Smith's \"brown race\" is not synonymous or equivalent with Sergi's Mediterranean race.\n\nThe Hamitic Hypothesis was still popular in the 1960s and late 1970s and was supported notably by Anthony John Arkell and George Peter Murdock.\n\nThe Egyptologist Samuel Sharpe (1846) proposed that the ancient Egyptians belonged to the Turanid race, linking them to the Tatars. He was inspired by some ancient Egyptian paintings, which depict Egyptians with sallow or yellowish skin. He said \"From the colour given to the women in their paintings we learn that their skin was yellow, like that of the Mongul Tartars, who have given their name to the Mongolian variety of the human race... The single lock of hair on the young nobles reminds us also of the Tartars.\"\n\nIn the early 20th century, Flinders Petrie, one of the leading Egyptologists of his day, noted that the skeletal remains found at predynastic sites at Naqada in Upper Egypt showed marked differentiation. Together with cultural evidence such as architectural styles, pottery styles, cylinder seals, and numerous rock and tomb paintings, he deduced that a Mesopotamian force had invaded Egypt in predynastic times, imposed itself on the indigenous Badarian people, and become their rulers. This came to be called the \"dynastic race theory\". The theory further argued that the Mesopotamian-founded state or states then conquered both Upper and Lower Egypt and founded the First Dynasty of Egypt.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Dynastic Race Theory was widely accepted by mainstream scholarship. Scholars such as the Senegalese Egyptologist Cheikh Anta Diop, fought against the Dynastic Race Theory with their own \"Black Egyptian\" theory and claimed, among other things, that European scholars supported the Dynastic Race Theory \"to avoid having to admit that Ancient Egyptians were black\". Bernal proposed that the Dynastic Race theory was conceived by European scholars to deny Egypt its African roots.\n\nContemporary scientists agree that Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development (see population history of Egypt).\n\n\n"}

She worked at the University of Oxford and like her mother she was known for her knowledge of the Italian Renaissance. She came to notice after her colleagues supported her reinstatement after she was dismissed by her former friend from her college.\n\nAdy was born in Edgcote in Northamptonshire in 1881. Her father was a reverend whilst her mother was a biographer and an amateur expert of the Italian Renaissance. Her mother's interest in Italy was influenced by her uncle William Cornwallis Cartwright. Her mother took on her daughters education and with that Ady went to Oxford where she obtained a first degree at St Hugh's Hall in 1903. She was a protege of the historian Edward Armstrong. He was commissioned to create a book series called \"The States of Italy\". His plans were not fulfilled and only Ady's book \"History of Milan under the Sforza\" was one of only two that were published.\n\nIn 1909 she joined her alma mater as a tutor where she had a close relationship with the college's principal, Eleanor Jourdain. Jourdain eventually turned against Ady, allegedly jealous of her popularity. Ady was sacked from her position in November 1923 at Jourdain's insistence for disloyalty. Jourdain felt that Ady had leaked information to the staff about her plans for a vice-principal at the college. Ady protested and a mass resignation followed including six of the college's council. The matter was a matter of some interest and Lord Curzon was asked to investigate. She was, in time, cleared and Jourdain died just before she was to be asked to resign. The inquiry resulted in improvements to the employment conditions of female tutors.\n\nAdy then became a tutor with the Society of Home Students and in 1929 her old college reemployed her as a research fellow.\n\nIn 1937 she was awarded the degree of Doctor of Literature after she published a monograph titled \"The Bentivoglio of Bologna: a Study in Despotism\".\n\nAdy died in Oxford in 1958.

{"id": "168224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168224", "title": "Cold War espionage", "text": "Cold War espionage\n\nCold War espionage describes the intelligence gathering activities during the Cold War (circa 1947-1991) between the Western allies (chief US, UK and NATO) and the Eastern Bloc (The Soviet Union and aligned countries of Warsaw Pact). Because each side was preparing to fight the other, intelligence on the opposing side's intentions, military, and technology was of paramount importance. To gather information, the two relied on a wide variety of military and civilian agencies.\n\nWhile several organizations such as the CIA and KGB became synonymous with Cold War espionage, many others played key roles in the collection and protection of the section concerning detection of spying, and analysis of a wide host of intelligence disciplines.\n\nSoviet espionage in the United States during the Cold War was an outgrowth in World War II nuclear espionage, and Cold War espionage was depicted in works such as the James Bond and Matt Helm books and movies.\n\nDuring the Cold War, information was a key commodity. It was vital to know what the adversary was up to, and the possibility of using the hi-tech surveillance that is used today was not around. Instead of trusting technology, we relied on spies: people who infiltrated enemy territory and tried to discover information while staying undetected.\n\nEspionage activities continued from prior to the beginning of the cold war in the late thirties- early forties, and all the way through the late 1960s and even continuing through today. These spies were decoding encrypted information, and using many skills to gain an advantage over other enemy countries.\n\nThe Cold War was all about gaining the advantage of information about the enemies' atomic weaponry. The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II led by the United States (and the Western Bloc) and the Soviet Union (and the Eastern Bloc). Although the two powers never engaged in a full out war, both countries were constantly preparing for an all-out nuclear war. Thus the use of spies to gain insight into the knowledge of how far their enemies were advancing.\n\nCambridge Five: The Cambridge Five consisted of five members that were recruited from the University of Cambridge in the 1930s. There is debate surrounding the exact timing of their recruitment, but it is generally believed that they were not recruited as agents until after they had graduated. The group included Kim Philby (cryptonym 'Stanley'), Donald Maclean (cryptonym 'Homer'), Guy Burgess (cryptonym 'Hicks'), Anthony Blunt (cryptonyms 'Tony', 'Johnson'), and John Cairncross (cryptonym 'Liszt'). There were many others that were accused of being a part of the Cambridge Spy Ring, but these five members were collectively known as the Cambridge Five.\n\nPortland Spy Ring: The Portland Spy Ring operated in England, as a Soviet spy ring, from the 1950s until 1961 when the core of the network were arrested by British Security Services. This spy ring was unique because they did not use the cover of an embassy as the cover for their spies. Its members included Harry Houghton, Ethel Gee, Gordon Lonsdale, and most famously Morris and Lona Cohen (cryptonym Peter and Helen Kroger).\n\nWare Group: Sleeper spy ring in US headed by J. Peters, first organized under Harold Ware, inherited by Whittaker Chambers (under orders from Peters), and also included: John Abt, Marion Bachrach (Abt's sister), Lee Pressman, Alger Hiss, Donald Hiss, Charles Kramer, Nathan Witt, Henry Collins, George Silverman, John Herrmann, Nathaniel Weyl, and Victor Perlo. When Chambers defected in 1938, the Ware Group went dormant and then broke up. Harry Dexter White (below) contributed materials to Chambers but not as part of the Ware Group.\n\nSilvermaster spy ring: The Silvermaster Spy Ring was led by Harry Dexter White, assistant secretary of the Treasury and the second most influential member of the Treasury department. His job was to aid placement of Soviet spies within the United States Government. The United States Treasury Department was successfully infiltrated by many Soviet spies, the most successful of which belonged to the Silvermaster Spy Ring. Harold Glasser, Elizabeth Bentley, and Nathan Silvermaster were other major members of the Silvermaster Spy Ring.\n\nAtomic spies: While the Atomic Spies were not exactly a network of spies, the collective information that was obtained by this group of Soviet spies was critical to the Soviet Union's ability to build an atomic bomb. Many of the members of the Atomic spies group worked for, or around, the Manhattan Project, or the United States building of the atomic bomb. This group included:\n\n\n\n\n\nWeapons System 117L - Weapons System 117L was the first program designed to develop space-based reconnaissance satellite systems. Several satellite systems would be developed through this program including Corona, the Satellite and Missile Observation System (SAMOS), and the Missile Detection Alarm System (MIDAS).\n\nSAMOS - SAMOS or the Satellite and Missile Observation system was one of the first of a series of short lived satellite systems developed by the United States, operated from October 1960 to November 1962. The SAMOS satellite system was one of the first systems developed through the WS-117L program. The system consisted of three primary components: visual reconnaissance, communications, and electronic intelligence gathering. Of the eleven launched attempted, 8 were successful. The program was likely cancelled because of poor image quality. The satellite could produce photos with 100 foot resolution. It was also heavily overshadowed by the Corona system operated by the CIA.\n\nMIDAS - MIDAS or the Missile Defense Alarm System was a satellite system operated by the United States between 1960 and 1966. This system was designed to be made of twelve satellites, although only nine satellites were successfully launched. The system was designed to provide early warning of Soviet missile launches. The system was eventually cancelled because of the high price and because of the slow warning times. This system, however, would be directly responsible for technologies used in its successors.\n\nCorona - Corona was among the first of a series of reconnaissance satellite systems developed through the WS-117L program. The Corona program was headed by the Central Intelligence Agency along with the Air Force. Corona satellites were used to photograph Soviet and other installations. The first successful Corona mission began on August 10, 1963. The Corona satellite system was expedited largely in part to the U-2 incident in 1960. All of the Corona missions, with the exception of the KH-11 Kennan program, would make use of photographic film, which would have to survive re-entry through the atmosphere and be recovered.\n\nKeyhole - Keyhole was the designation for the initial Corona launches, which included KH-1, KH-2, KH-3, KH-4A, and KH-4B. The name was used because it is analogous to spying through the keyhole of a door. 144 satellites would be launched through this program, and 102 returned usable photos.\n\nKeyhole/Argon (KH-5) - Argon was the designation the surveillance satellites,manufactured by Lockheed, used by the United States from February 1961 to August 1964. Argon made use of photographic film in a way similar of the original Corona satellites. Of the twelve known launches, seven were not successful for varying reasons.\n\nKeyhole/Lanyard (KH-6) - Lanyard was the designation for the first, albeit unsuccessful, attempt to establish a high resolution, optical satellite system. This program would be led by the newly established National Reconnaissance Office, and operated from March–July 1963. Because it was only able to achieve a resolution similar to that of the KH-4 satellites, it was discontinued after only 3 launches.\n\nKeyhole/Gambit (KH-7) - Gambit was the next of a series of satellites operated by the United States, by the National Reconnaissance Office, from July 1963 to June 1967. It was among the first successful Corona missions as it produced some of the first high resolution photos. These photos were typically of Soviet and Chinese missile emplacements. Gambit satellites would make use of a three camera system and missions would last typically up to eight days.\n\nKeyhole/Gambit III (KH-8) - The Gambit III satellite system was amongst the longest serving satellite reconnaissance programs operated by the United States during the Cold War. This satellite system would operate from July 1966 to April 1984. Of the fifty-four launch attempts, only three would fail, all of which were attributed to rocket failure. The average mission time of the Gambit III satellite systems were thirty-one days. The Gambit III satellites would differ from the Gambit I satellites in that the Gambit III had a four camera system, which carried over twelve thousand feet of film, and were able to produce resolutions as small as four inches.\n\nKeyhole/Hexagon (KH-9) - The Hexagon satellite system, commonly known as Big Bird, this satellite system was operated from 1971 and 1986. The Hexagon system was officially known as the Broad Coverage Photo Reconnaissance satellites. These satellites photographed large areas of the earth at a time with moderate resolution. These satellites were also used for mapping missions, which were used in map making. Three Hexagon missions also included electronic intelligence or ELINT gathering capabilities. These were used to eavesdrop on soviet communications and on soviet missile launches. Twenty launches were attempted, only one was unsuccessful. These satellites operated for an increasing duration of time, with the longest mission lasting 275 days.\n\nKeyhole/Kennan (KH-11) - The KH-11 Kennan, which goes under the code name Crystal, was first launched in 1976, and missions are still ongoing to this day. According to leaked documents, this program is currently operation under the code name Evolved Enhanced Crystal. The Kennan satellite system was the first satellite system to use electro-optical imaging, which gives real time imaging capabilities. The resolution of these satellites is estimated to be as low as 2 inches. These satellites are unique in that they have been placed in sun-synchronous orbits, which allow them to use shadows to help discern ground features. These satellites became famous in 1978 when a CIA employee tried to leak the design of the satellite to the Soviets. He was tried and convicted of espionage.\n\nKeyhole/Improved Crystal (KH-12) – The later KH-11 satellites have been called KH-12 improved Crystal or Ikon satellites. These satellites also had increased download times which allowed for faster processing of photos. It is also suspected that these satellites may have stealth technology to avoid detection by other satellites.\n\nVela - The Vela satellite system was developed to by the United States to ensure that the Soviet Union complied with the Partial Test Ban Treaty which was ratified in 1963. The satellites were designed to monitor for nuclear explosions in space and in the atmosphere by measuring for neutrons and gamma rays. A total of twelve Vela satellites were launched during the course of the Cold War. The Vela satellites became publicly famous because of the Vela Incident which occurred on 22 September 1979. It was theorized at the time that it was a nuclear test conducted by South Africa and Israel, but new evidence does not support this theory. They have also been used in the study of Gamma-Ray Bursts.\nU-2 – The U-2 aircraft, known as the \"Dragon Lady\", was developed by the Lockheed Skunk Works, and was first flown on August 1, 1955. The aircraft was initially flown by the CIA, but control was later transferred to the Air Force. The aircraft was designed to fly at altitudes of 70,000 ft. The U-2 was equipped with a camera which had a resolution of 2.5 feet at an altitude of 60,000 ft. The first overflights of the Soviet Union by the U-2 began in May 1956. The aircraft became publicly prominent after a U-2 aircraft flown by Francis Gary Powers was hit by an SA-2 missile and crash landed in the USSR.\n\nSR-71 – The SR-71 Blackbird is a long-range reconnaissance aircraft developed by Lockheed Skunk Works, and designed by Kelly Johnson. The aircraft is known for setting speed and altitude records. The SR-71 was equipped with optical and infrared imaging systems, electronic intelligence gathering systems, side looking airborne radar, and recorders for those systems which are listed. The aircraft required two personnel to pilot it, one to pilot the aircraft, and a Reconnaissance Systems Officer (RSO) to operate the systems.\n\nZenit (Zenith) - The Zenith Satellite program, was a satellite program developed by the Soviet Union and used from 1961 to 1994. During the course of its lifespan over 500 Zenith satellites were launched, making it the most used satellite system ever. The Soviets concealed the nature of the system by giving the satellites the Kosmos designation. The Zenith satellites had an advantage over the satellites developed by the United States, in that they could be reused. A total of eight variants would be developed for a variety of mission types, ranging from high-resolution photography to ELINT to cartographic and topographic missions.\n\nYantar - The Yantar satellites, designed to replace the Zenit satellite system, are among the newest Russian satellites. Yantar satellites have been launched as recently as 2015. Two variants of the satellite have been developed for high-resolution photography and for medium-resolution broad spectrum imaging.\n\nAfter 1990s new memoirs and archival materials have opened up the study of espionage and intelligence during the Cold War. Scholars are reviewing how its origins, its course, and its outcome were shaped by the intelligence activities of the United States, the Soviet Union, and other key countries. Special attention is paid to how complex images of one's adversaries were shaped by secret intelligence that is now publicly known.\n\nThe Soviet Union proved especially successful in placing spies in Britain and West Germany. It was largely unable to repeat its successes in the 1930s in the United States. NATO, on the other hand, also had a few successes of importance, of whom Oleg Gordievsky was perhaps the most influential. He was a senior KGB officer who was a double agent on behalf of Britain's MI6, providing a stream of high-grade intelligence that had an important influence on the thinking of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He was spotted by Aldrich Ames a Soviet agent who worked for the CIA, but he was successfully exfiltrated from Moscow in 1985. Biographer Ben McIntyre argues he was the West's most valuable human asset, especially for his deep psychological insights into the inner circles of the Kremlin. He convinced Washington and London that the fierceness and bellicosity of the Kremlin was a product of fear, and military weakness, rather than an urge for world conquest. Thatcher and Reagan concluded they could moderate their own anti-Soviet rhetoric, as successfully happened when Mikhail Gorbachev took power, thus ending the Cold War.\n\n\n\n"}

It attempted to coalesce the Calvinist and the advanced Zwinglian doctrines while standing opposed to transubstantiation, the Roman Catholic view, and sacramental union, the Lutheran view. It was accepted by the churches in Zurich, Geneva, Saint Gall, Schaffhausen, the Grisons, Neuchâtel, and eventually by Basel, and brought them into harmony with one another. It was \"favorably received\" in France, England, and parts of Germany, but while Melancthon said that he understood the Swiss for the first time and would no longer write against them, it was attacked by the Gnesio-Lutheran Joachim Westphal and \"became the innocent occasion of the second sacramental war.\"\n\n"}

Yavornytsky was a member of Moscow Archaeological Society (from 1885), of St. Petersburg Russian Archaeological Society (from 1886) and academician of Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (from 1929).\n\nHe was one of the most prominent researchers of the Zaporozhian Cossacks from the time of the Hetmanate, and the author of their first general history. In recognition of his many contributions to the preservation of Zaporozhian history and culture, he is widely known as \"the father of the Zaporozhians\".\n\nYavornytsky was educated at Kharkov University, Kazan, and Warsaw universities but his academic career was repeatedly interrupted for political reasons. Both as a student and later as a teacher, he was wrongly accused of \"Ukrainian separatism\" and dismissed from his position. In the 1890s, he was compelled to go to Russian Turkestan in order to find employment. In 1897, the Russian historian Vasily Klyuchevsky helped him to obtain a position as lecturer on the Zaporozhian Cossacks at Moscow University. In 1902, when he was offered a position as Director of the Ekaterinoslav Historical Museum in modern-day central Ukraine, he gladly accepted and remained there to the end of his life.\n\nAs a historian, Yavornytsky displayed a romantic-antiquarian approach to his subject and was a conscious follower of his predecessor Nikolay Kostomarov. He was an enthusiast who avidly sought out documents and material artifacts, as well as stories and the songs of the elderly, concerning the Zaporozhian Cossacks, and he wrote his histories on the basis of this material. He was a pioneer of Zaporozhian history and was the first to compile an extensive archive of materials on their entire history — from their origins, to their demise. He published much of this material in various collections, often at his own expense.\n\nYavornytsky's major work was the \"History of the Zaporozhian Cossacks\" which was published in Russian in three volumes between 1892 and 1897. He planned, but never completed, a fourth volume. In this and in his other works, he portrayed the Zaporozhians as representatives of Ukrainian liberty. Later Ukrainian historians criticized him as being uncritical and unsystematic in his collection of source materials (Mykhailo Hrushevsky) and lacking an appreciation for Ukrainian statehood (Dmytro Doroshenko), but Yavornytsky wrote at a time when political circumstances and the Imperial Russian censors were extremely oppressive and any synthesis of Ukrainian history which displayed an enthusiasm for the subject, let alone political independence, was highly suspect. His \"History of the Zaporozhian Cossacks\" was a pioneering work which did display such an enthusiasm.\n\nYavornytsky was a pioneer in the fields of ethnography, folkloristics, and lexicography. He made numerous contributions to the historical geography of the Zaporozhian lands, and mapped in detail the Dnieper River rapids with the locations of the various Zaporozhian Siches, or fortified headquarters. He published a large collection of Ukrainian folksongs (1906; partly reprinted, 1990) as soon as the censor would permit it, contributed to Borys Hrinchenko's great Ukrainian dictionary, and after the Russian Revolution began publication of one of his own (1920).\n\nHe increased the holdings of the Yekaterinoslav Museum from 5,000 to 80,000 items. Yavornytsky commissioned the best Ukrainian and Russian artists of his time (Opanas Slastion, Serhii Vasylkivsky, Nikolai Samokish, and Ilya Repin) to illustrate his various books, which were sometimes works of art in themselves. Especially notable in this regard is his \"From Ukrainian Antiquity\" (1900; reprinted in Ukrainian translation, 1991) which was lavishly illustrated in full colour and contained parallel texts in Russian and French so that it could be read abroad.\n\nDuring the repressions of the 1930s under Joseph Stalin, Yavornytsky was prevented from publishing and had to keep a very low profile. During the Holodomor (the Ukrainian famine of 1932–33), he felt compelled to give away artifacts from his collections to obtain food for starving local peasants and others.\n\nHis death passed unnoticed both in the USSR and in the wider world. The Yekaterinoslav (today Dnipro) Museum was eventually renamed in his honour, and he was partially rehabilitated during the Nikita Khrushchev and Petro Shelest eras. Materials about him began to appear, and in the early 1970s a four volume collection of his works was prepared for publication. Political circumstances again prevented this from happening, but with the advent of the Perestroika reforms in the late 1980s, new materials began to appear and his major works were republished. At that time, his \"History of the Zaporozhian Cossacks\" was reprinted both in Russian and in Ukrainian (1990–91). The Ukrainian edition contains numerous additional illustrations. In 2004, the first volume of his \"Collected Works in Twenty Volumes\" was published. The first ten volumes of this collection will be dedicated to his historical, geographical, and archaeological works, while the second ten volumes will contain his works on folklore, ethnography, and language.\n\nToday, Yavornytsky is still widely revered as \"the father of the Zaporozhians\".\n\nIn order to comply with decommunization laws the city of Dnipropetrovsk renamed its main street from Karl Marx Avenue to Yavornytskyi Avenue in February 2016.\n\nYavornytsky is portrayed on the painting of Ilya Repin's \"The Satirical Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks to Sultan Mehmed IV of Turkey\" as the secretary penning the letter to the Sultan. Repin consulted Yavornytsky during his work on the painting and made use of several artifacts from the historian's collection to use as accurate models.\n\n\n"}

In philosophy he mostly specialised in Aristotelico-Thomist Scholasticism.\n\nPace was born at Vittoriosa, Malta, on December 17, 1851. He joined the Dominicans in 1867 at almost 16 years of age. He accomplished his institutional studies in philosophy with the Dominicans at Rabat, Malta, and his theological ones with the Dominicans at Vittoriosa. Due to the colera epidemic which hit the Maltese islands in those days, Pace was sent to Florence, Italy, at the convent of Saint Maximin, to pursue his theological studies there. In 1874 he acquired his colour in philosophy and theology.\n\nBack in Malta, Pace was ordained a priest, and chosen as the Master of Dominican Students at Rabat, Malta. Here, from 1874 onwards, he also taught philosophy at the Dominican Studium Generale. In recognition of his publication \"Difesa della Dottrina di S. Tommaso d’Aquino\" in 1877, Pace was made member of the Philosophical-Medical Academy of Bologna, Italy. Later, he was also awarded the title General Preacher by the Order of Preachers in Rome, Italy.\n\nPace died at Vittoriosa on June 29, 1907. Though his funeral was held at Vittoriosa, he was buried within the church of the Dominicans at Rabat, Malta.\n\nPace’s only extant work, Difesa della Dottrina di S. Tommaso d’Aquino (A Defence of the Doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas), published in 1877 (Tipografia E. Laferla, Malta), was composed as a response to a book published by a priest, Francis Reale, in 1873 in which, while discussing the Bible, he attributed to Aquinas certain theories considered erroneous by Pace. Reale went so far to suggest that Aquinas was a heretic.\n\nSince Reale also proposed that most Dominicans do not agree with Aquinas’ doctrine on humans’ natural disposition to know God, Pace counters such a proposition. Accordingly, his pamphlet, which is made up of just 25 pages, deals mainly with humans’ natural knowledge of God, and the natural disposition of pagans to believe in Jesus Christ. Of course, the source of Pace’s teachings is Aquinas himself. Nevertheless, many biblical references and citations are included too. Pace philosophically maintains that Aquinas is correct in what he teaches, and that all Dominicans subscribed to his point of view.\n\nUnderstanably, the \"Difesa\" is a polemical work. Though Pace recognises that philosophy should have no authority except reason, he submits that Aquinas is a clear and authoritative reflection enough of natural reason.\n\n\n"}

According to this theory, each dynasty rises to a political, cultural, and economic peak and then, because of moral corruption, declines, loses the Mandate of Heaven, and falls, only to be replaced by a new dynasty. The cycle then repeats under a surface pattern of repetitive motifs.\n\nIt sees a continuity in Chinese history from early times to the present by looking at the succession of empires or dynasties, implying that there is little basic development or change in social or economic structures. John K. Fairbank expressed the doubts of many historians when he wrote that \"the concept of the dynastic cycle... has been a major block to the understanding of the fundamental dynamics of Chinese history.\"\n\nThe cycle appears as follows:\n\n\nThe Mandate of Heaven was the idea that the Emperor was favored by Heaven to rule over China. The Mandate of Heaven explanation was championed by the Chinese philosopher Mencius during the Warring States period.\n\nIt has 3 main phases:\n\nChinese history is traditionally represented in terms of dynastic cycles. Through its long history, the Chinese have been ruled not by one dynasty, but by a succession of different dynasties. The first dynasty in China to be described in ancient historical records such as Records of the Grand Historian and Bamboo Annals is the Xia, which was succeeded by the Shang, although concrete existence of the Xia is yet to be archaeologically proven.\n\nAmong these dynasties the Han and Tang are often considered as particularly strong periods, although other dynasties are famous for cultural and other achievements (for instance, the Song dynasty is sometimes associated with rapid economic development). Han and Tang, as well as other long, stable dynasties were followed by periods of disorder and the break-up of China into small regimes.\n\nOut of disorder a leader eventually arose who unified the country and imposed strong central authority. For example, after the Han various dynasties ruled parts of China until Yang Jian reunited the country and established the Sui dynasty. The Sui set the scene for the long and prosperous Tang. After the fall of Tang, China again saw a period of political upheaval.\n\nThere is a famous Chinese proverb expressed in the 16th century novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms that says \"After a long split, a union will occur; after a long union, a split will occur\" (分久必合，合久必分). Each of these rulers would claim the Mandate of Heaven to legitimize their rule.\n\nAlthough this well-known dynastic periodization of China is more or less based on traditional Sinocentric ideology, it also applies to non-native rulers who sought to gain the Mandate of Heaven. While most ruling dynasties in Chinese history were founded by native Chinese, there were also non-native or Conquest Dynasties established by non-Han Chinese people beyond the traditional border of central part of China dominated by Han Chinese people (also known as China proper). These include the Yuan founded by Mongols and the Qing founded by Manchus, who later conquered the central part of China and assumed the title of Emperor of China.\n\n\n"}

Wednesday is divided into Wednesday proper (midnight to noon) and Rahu (noon to midnight). Each day is associated with a compass direction, a planet, and a totem animal.\n\nThe ancient Etruscans developed an eight-day market week known as the nundinum around the 8th or 7th century BC. This was passed on to the Romans no later than the 6th century BC. As Rome expanded, it encountered the seven-day week and for a time attempted to include both. The popularity of the seven-day rhythm won and the eight-day week disappeared.\n\nThe cycle of seven days, named after the sun, the moon, and the five planets visible to the naked eye, was already customary in the time of Justin Martyr, who wrote of the Christians meeting on the Day of the Sun (Sunday).\n\nEmperor Constantine eventually established the seven-day week in the Roman calendar in AD 321.\n\nThe Celts used periods of darkness such as night and winter to begin their calculations of time. This meant that the first period of time in a \"week\" was a night, followed by a day. Further, they also counted the ending night period, giving rise to periods of time with more nights than days. In Irish, the term \"nómad\" is used to signify a small number of days and is exactly the length of the nine night week as in \"co cend nomaide\" - a period of time with nine nights bracketing eight days. The nine nights divided nicely into a sidereal month of 27 nights. In Welsh a similar word \"wythnos\" meaning \"a week\" literally means \"an eight-night\" since it started and ended with a period of night bracketing seven days. Similarly a fortnight \"pythefnos\" means \"a fifteen night\".\n"}

{"id": "2406219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2406219", "title": "Georges Chastellain", "text": "Georges Chastellain\n\nGeorges Chastellain (c. 1405 or c. 1415 – 20 March 1475), Burgundian chronicler and poet, was a native of Aalst in Flanders. Chastellain's historical works are valuable for the accurate information they contain. As a poet he was famous among his contemporaries. He was the great master of the school of \"grands rhétoriqueurs\", whose principal characteristics were fondness for the most artificial forms and a profusion of Latinisms and graecisms.\n\nGeorges Chastellain derived his surname from the fact that his ancestors were burgraves or châtelains of the town; his parents, who belonged to illustrious Flemish families, were probably the Jean Chastellain and his wife Marie de Masmines mentioned in the town records in 1425 and 1432. A copy of an epitaph originally at Valenciennes states that he died on 20 March 1474-5 aged seventy. But since he states that he was so young a child in 1430 that he could not recollect the details of events in that year, and since he was an \"ecolier\" at Louvain in 1430, his birth may probably be placed nearer 1415 than 1405.\n\nHe saw active service in the Anglo-French wars and probably elsewhere, winning the surname of L'adventureux. In 1434 he received a gift from Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, for his military services, but on the conclusion of the peace of Arras in the next year he abandoned soldiering for diplomacy. The next ten years were spent in France, where he was connected with Georges de la Trémoille, and afterwards entered the household of Pierre de Brézé, at that time seneschal of Poitou, by whom he was employed on missions to the duke of Burgundy, in an attempt to establish better relations between Charles VII and the duke.\n\nDuring these years Chastellain had ample opportunity of obtaining an intimate knowledge of French affairs, but on the further breach between the two princes, Chastellain left the French service to enter Philip's household. He was at first pantler, then carver, titles which are misleading as to the actual nature of his services, which were those of a diplomatist; and in 1457 he became a member of the ducal council. He was continually employed on diplomatic errands until 1455, when, owing apparently to ill-health, he received apartments in the palace of the counts of Hainaut at Salle-le-Comte, Valenciennes, with a considerable pension, on condition that the recipient should put in writing \"choses nouvelles et morales\", and a chronicle of notable events. That is to say, he was appointed Burgundian historiographer with a recommendation to write also on other subjects not strictly within the scope of a chronicler.\n\nFrom this time he worked hard at his \"Chronique\", with occasional interruptions in his retreat to fulfil missions in France or to visit the Burgundian court. He was assisted, from about 1463 onwards, by his disciple and continuator, Jean Molinet, whose rhetorical and redundant style may be fairly traced in some passages of the \"Chronique\". Charles the Bold maintained the traditions of his house as a patron of literature, and showed special favor to Chastellain, who, after being constituted \"indiciaire\" or chronicler of the Order of the Golden Fleece, was himself made a knight of the order on 2 May 1473. He died at Valenciennes in 1475, on 13 February (according to the treasury accounts), or on 20 March (according to his epitaph). He left an illegitimate son, to whom was paid in 1524 one hundred and twenty livres for a copy of the \"Chronique\" intended for Charles V's sister Mary, queen of Hungary. Only about one third of the whole work, which extended from 1419 to 1474, is known to be in existence, but manuscripts carried by the Habsburgs to Vienna or Madrid may possibly yet be discovered.\n\nAmong his contemporaries Chastellain acquired a great reputation by his poems and occasional pieces now little considered. The unfinished state of his \"Chronique\" at the time of his death, coupled with political considerations, may possibly account for the fact that it remained unprinted during the century that followed his death, and his historical work was only disinterred from the libraries of Arras, Paris and Brussels by the painstaking researches of Jean Alexandre Buchon in 1825.\n\nChastellain was constantly engaged during the earlier part of his career in negotiations between the French and Burgundian courts, and thus had personal knowledge of the persons and events dealt with in his history. A partisan element in writing of French affairs was inevitable in a Burgundian chronicle. This feature appears most strongly in his treatment of Joan of Arc; and the attack on Agnès Sorel seems to have been dictated by the dauphin (afterwards Louis XI), then a refugee in Burgundy, of whom he was afterwards to become a severe critic.\n\nAmong his most sympathetic portraits are those of his friend Pierre de Brézé and of Jacques Coeur. His French style, based partly on his Latin reading, has, together with its undeniable vigour and picturesqueness, the characteristic redundance and rhetorical quality of the Burgundian school. Chastellain was no mere annalist, but proposed to fuse and shape his vast material to his own conclusions, in accordance with his political experience. The most interesting feature of his work is the skill with which he pictures the leading figures of his time. His characters are the fruit of acute and experienced observation, and abound in satirical traits, although the 42nd chapter of his second book, devoted expressly to portraiture, is headed \"Comment Georges escrit et mentionne les louanges vertueuses des princes de son temps\".\n\nThe known extant fragments of Chastellain's \"Chroniques\" with his other works were edited by Kervyn de Lettenhove for the Brussels Academy (8 vols., Brussels, 1863–1866) as \"L'Oeuvre de Georges Chastellain\". This edition includes all that had been already published by Buchon in his \"Collection de chroniques\" and\" Choix de chroniques\" (material subsequently incorporated in the \"Panthéon littéraire\"), and portions printed by Renard in his \"Trésor national\", vol. i. and by Quicherat in the \"Procès de la Pucelle\" vol. iv. Kervyn de Lettenhove's text includes the portions of the chronicle covering the periods September 1419 to October 1422, January 1430 to December 1431, 1451–1452, July 1454 to October 1458, July 1461 to July 1463, and, with omissions, June 1467 to September 1470; and three volumes of minor pieces of considerable interest, especially \"Le Temple de Boccace\", dedicated to Margaret of Anjou, and the \"Déprécation\" for Pierre de Brézé when imprisoned by Louis XI. In the case of these minor works the attribution to Chastellain is in some cases erroneous, notably in the case of the \"Livre des faits de Jacques de Lalaing\", which is the work of Lefebvre de Saint-Remi, Herald of the Golden Fleece. In the allegorical \"Oultr d'amour\" it has been thought a real romance between Pierre de Brézé and a lady of the royal house is concealed.\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated at the college of Juilly, he served in the army until 1697.\n\nPrimarily remembered as an early modern historian of the French State, Boulainvilliers also published an early French translation of Spinoza's \"Ethics\" and wrote on topics as diverse as astrology, physics, philosophy and theology.\n\nThe Comte de Boulainvilliers traced his lineage to the House of Croÿ, to Jean de Croÿ, sire de Clery et de Boulainviller, who died in the Battle of Poitiers (1356). At the time of his birth, however, the family's fortune had declined significantly. Much of Boulainvilliers' historical work and political life centered on the decline of the nobility.\n\nIn 1669, Henri de Boulainvilliers went to study at the Collège de Juilly, one of the most famous schools of the Congregation of the Oratory of Philip Neri. Exact sciences, history and geography were taught there. \nThe philosopher Malebranche being one of the great educators at the Oratory, cartesianism was allowed reference in the classroom from 1662 till 1675 when it was banned by Royal arrest. \nIn 1673, Henry studied rhetoric with his teacher Richard Simon, who was excluded from the Oratory (1678) because of his critical Bible studies.\n\nThe education at Juilly had great impact on Boulainvilliers: a special accent on critical history had been introduced into the Oratory by Caesar Baronius and Richard Simon, and through the science classes he became familiar with the works of Jean Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle and Edme Mariotte.\n\nSince he had also received private lessons in the German language, it is not inconceivable that he was able to read van Helmont in Middle Dutch that author used as a critical means to an accessible reading of medicine in the Low Countries, and which so fluently worded his rich independence of mind.\n\nIn 1683 Boulainvilliers wrote \" \"l'Idée d'un Système Général de la Nature\" based on his reading of Jan Baptist van Helmont and Robert Boyle, followed by \"Archidoxes de Paracelsus, avec une préface sur les principes de l'art chimique\".\n\nBy 1715-1720, he wrote his \"Traité d'astronomie physique\" using the Cartesian method, commenting on the nature of gravity and the movement of planets and drawing on sources such as Jean-Baptiste du Hamel and Huygens.\n\nHe described his method as experimental philosophy and closely preceded the Dutch experimentalists led by Anthony Leeuwenhoek (Nieuwentijt, Boerhave, Volder)\n\nHe retained affection for astrology, for which he was famous in Court gossip.\n\nIn a \"Lettre à Mlle Cousinot sur l'histoire de France et le choix des historiens\"\" he explained why the writing of history was to be more than the \"amateur\" collection of dates and anecdotes related to old coins (numismatics) and stones: The knowledge of history pertained to a distinct moral character of society. Related causes of past events, such as the 1346 Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years' War, could be instructive on related measures in the present — how to do things better or worse. Sometimes we want to know not only what a historical figure has done, but by what right he might have done so differently.\n\nHe stressed in his writings the corruption absolutism played in the fall of France when he contrasts the role English and French historians were able to investigate history. For instance, when stressing the importance of sources in developing fact, he contrasted Thomas Rymer's way of access to the London archives to that of his own where he had to bribe the keepers of the French archives. For his neutral reasoning, his works were cited by subsequent writers whose works would prove influential in the development of Western political thought and historical research.\n\nParallel to his historical studies ran an untiring interest in philosophy which he wrote down in \"Considérations abrégées des operations de l'entendement sur les idées\" on the model borrowed from the famous \"Port-Royal Logic\" by Antoine Arnauld: psychology of the mind, logic, and method; to which he added ontology. His influences, apart from the Schola of his early education, were Gassendi, Descartes, Malebranche, Locke and Spinoza.\n\nBoulainvilliers's translation of Spinoza's \"Ethics\" was not published until 1907 by Colonna d'Istria from an unsigned manuscript at Lyon.\n\nBoulainvilliers's study of Spinoza, as captured in the collected treatises published by Renée Simon (1973), shows an exceptional development from a basic criticism to an enlightened understanding marked by the incredibly generous way in which he let his opponent use his own voice.\n\nIn the \"Essay de Métaphysique dans les principes de B...de Sp...\" he translated Spinoza's \"geometrical method\" into an accessible French, closely following its original meaning without incisive criticism.\n\nIn the \"Exposition du système de Benoit Spinosa et sa defense contre les objections de M. Régis\" he voiced the defense of Spinoza against his cartesian critic Pierre-Sylvain Régis. The comte Boulainvilliers was no blind follower of Descartes; he knew how to make use of his method, but he could equally well criticise him on metaphysical points.\n\nThis unusual way of writing philosophy led to the gossip that he was a Spinozist and therefore an atheist. Yet in his persistent criticism of Spinoza's monism (through the concept of the \"unity of substance\"), in writings inaccessible to the multitude, his independent judgement remained unspoilt. After his death his name was frequently used to circulate anti-religious treatises, leading to still more confusion about his intellectual identity.\n\nWith Matthieu Marais he shared a friendship with another great student of Spinoza, Pierre Bayle.\n\nLess well known but as important in his time was the similar treatment he gave to the mysticism of Molinos in : \"Extrait du livre du ministre Pierre Jurieu touchant les dogmes des mystiques et particulièrement contre Messieurs de Cambray et de Méaux.\" By the time the reader finished his lecture he had a complete survey of the works of Molinos, thus recapitulating the famous disagreements over Quietism.\n\nSuch are the traits that can make one regret the criticism — amply justified in retrospect — that Boulainvilliers, elsewhere, brought over himself by his brutal stance on feudalism; traits for which he equally deserves to be known to a larger circle of students.\n\nBoulainvilliers wrote a number of historical works (published after his death), of which the most important were the following:\n\n\n"}

He then studied comparative linguistics, gaining a good command of Sanskrit. He wrote his doctoral thesis on the role of the jester in Indian drama in 1897.\n\nIt was not until 1902 that his interest turned towards medieval and Renaissance history. He continued teaching as an Orientalist until he became a Professor of General and Dutch History at Groningen University in 1905. In 1915, he was made Professor of General History at Leiden University, a post he held until 1942. In 1916 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn 1942, he spoke critically of his country's German occupiers, comments that were consistent with his writings about Fascism in the 1930s. He was held in detention by the Nazis between August and October 1942. Upon his release, he was banned from returning to Leiden. He subsequently lived at the house of his colleague Rudolph Cleveringa in De Steeg in Gelderland, near Arnhem, where he died just a few weeks before Nazi rule ended. He lies buried in the graveyard of the Reformed Church at 6 Haarlemmerstraatweg in Oegstgeest.\n\nHuizinga had an aesthetic approach to history, where art and spectacle played an important part. His most famous work is \"The Autumn of the Middle Ages\" (a.k.a. \"The Waning of the Middle Ages\") (1919).\n\nWorthy of mentioning are also \"Erasmus\" (1924) and \"Homo Ludens\" (1938). In the latter book he discussed the possibility that play is the primary formative element in human culture. Huizinga also published books on American history and Dutch history in the 17th century.\n\nAlarmed by the rise of National Socialism in Germany, Huizinga wrote several works of cultural criticism. Many similarities can be noted between his analysis and that of contemporary critics such as Ortega y Gasset and Oswald Spengler. Huizinga argued that the spirit of technical and mechanical organisation had replaced spontaneous and organic order in cultural as well as political life.\n\nThe Huizinga Lecture (Dutch: \"Huizingalezing\") is a prestigious annual lecture in the Netherlands about a subject in the domains of cultural history or philosophy in honour of Johan Huizinga.\n\nHuizinga's son Leonhard Huizinga became a well-known writer in the Netherlands, especially renowned for his series of tongue-in-cheek novels on the Dutch aristocratic twins (\"Adriaan en Olivier\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

At the age of 15 he moved to Harlem, New York, where he enrolled in Stuyvesant High School. During this time, he became interested in African-American history and culture and began writing essays on the subject. They were so impressive that in 1925, while still a high school student, Jackson was invited to write for Marcus Garvey's newspaper, \"Negro World\".\n\nFrom 1930 onwards, Jackson became associated with a number of Pan-African historians, activists and writers, including Hubert Harrison, Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, John Henrik Clarke, Willis Nathaniel Huggins and Joel Augustus Rogers. He also authored a number of books on African history, promoting a Pan-African and Afrocentrist view, such as \"Man, God, and Civilization\" (1972) and \"Introduction to African Civilizations\" (1974). He also became interested in the idea of Christianity's origins in the Egyptian religion. A staunch atheist, he authored a number of books on the idea, including \"The African Origin of Christianity\" (1981) and \"Christianity before Christ\" (1985), as well as writing the foreword to \"Gerald Massey's Lectures\" (1974). He also wrote the controversial text, \"Was Jesus Christ a Negro?\" (1984), which argued that Jesus may have been a black man. In 1987, Jackson wrote a biographical article about Hubert Harrison for American Atheists entitled \"Hubert Henry Harrison: The Black Socrates\". In it, he praised not only Harrison's agnostic atheism, but also his educational and civil rights achievements. It was later published as a seven-page pamphlet.\n\nDuring his life, Jackson also served as Associate Director of the Blyden Society and lectured at many colleges and universities throughout the United States.

Tibna\")(), sometimes referred to by historical geographers as the Timnah of Judah (), is a small ruin situated on a high ridge in the Judaean mountains, in the \"Sansan Nature Reserve\", above sea level, about 3 kilometers east of Aviezer and ca. 7 kilometers southeast of Bayt Nattif. The site is thought to have formerly borne the name Timnath, distinct from the Tel Batash-Timnah site associated with the biblical story of Samson in the lower foothills of Judea along the Sorek valley. \"Kh. et-Tibbaneh\" (Timnah) is perched upon a high mountain ridge rising up from the Elah valley and is where the episode of Judah and Tamar is thought to have taken place.\n\nOrientalists, Clermont-Ganneau and Edward Robinson, have made a point in showing the etymological Hebrew origins of certain Arabic place-names, saying that the Hebrew place-name Timnah was to be recognised in the Arabic corruption, \"Tibneh\" or \"Tibna\". John William McGarvey (1881) who quotes Conder on the linguistic evidence of the name says that, in Arabic, \"the substitution of B for M is so common (as in Tibneh for Timnah)...\" Both names have been preserved in the respective sites.\n\nIn ancient Jewish classical literature, two distinct sites in the land of Judah bore the name Timnath (Timnah). The Book of Joshua records the names of two towns, both in the tribal inheritance of Judah and having the identical name of Timnath; the one Timnath being transcribed alongside the name of Beit Shemesh, while the other Timnath being transcribed alongside the name of Gibeah (of Judah), a town said to be Jab'a. The Jerusalem Talmud (\"Sotah\" 1:8) relates the following tradition: \"Rav has said: There were two Timnaths; one mentioned in connection with Judah, and the other mentioned in connection with Samson.\" The Talmudic exegetes have explained that Samson, who lived in the hilltop town of Zorah near Beit Shemesh, is said to have 'gone down' to Timnath, but Judah is said to have 'gone up' to Timnath. \"Kh. et-Tibbâneh\" is thought to be the Timnath (Timnah) mentioned in connection with Judah and Tamar , although this view remains inconclusive.\n\n\"Khirbet et Tibbaneh\" (\"Tibna\") was visited by Palestine Exploration Fund explorers, Conder and Kitchener, in the late 19th-century, where they described the ruin as follows: \"Timnah - A town of Judah , mentioned with Gibeah. There is a ruin called \"Tibna\" near Jeb'a, in the higher hills of ʾArkûb, distinct from Tibneh , which represents the Timnah of Joshua XV.10.\"\n\nOthers are unsure of its identification, since the site has yet to be fully excavated.\n\nThe ancient ruin sits on a high mountain ridge about 2 kilometers west of \"Khirbet Sanasin\". On its site is found the remnant of a square Iron Age fortress which apparently offered security along the route from the valley of Elah to Betar and to Jerusalem. The area of the fortress is 30 x 30 meters (98 x 98 feet), where two walls made of fieldstones and ashlar masonry still remain, whose hollowed spaces were filled-in with smaller stones. Amihai Mazar suggests that the structure served as either a fortress or an administrative center, and most likely manned by a garrison to secure the roads between the major towns of the Shephelah and the string of settlements along the edge of the hill region.\n\nThe mound is almost entirely strewn with razed boulders, and ancillary walls, partially standing, are to be seen on the ruin. On its eastern side is a steep declivity, descending down into the valley below, \"Wadi Tibbaneh\" (\"Wadi Tibna\"), where it joins Etzion Valley (\"Wady el Jindy\") to its south at a drop of about . The valley seemed to have been used for horticulture in ages past. Sherds dot the landscape, with occasional carob trees, oaks and buckthorns. Near the site is a modern-day quarry and two ancient cisterns. In close proximity to \"Khirbet et-Tibbaneh\" is the old military patrol road, leading from Tzur Hadassah to Aviezer.\n\n\"Khirbet et-Tibbaneh\" (\"Tibna\") is thought to be the \"Tapuna\" mentioned in the list of Thothmes III. \n\nIsraeli archaeologist Avi-Yonah also thinks the site to have been the \"Timnah\" (Thamnatha) mentioned in the \"First Book of Maccabees\" (and later mentioned by Josephus), one of several places fortified by Bacchides in ca. 160 BCE after the death of Judas Maccabeus. Others suggest that the account in \"Maccabees\" may refer to another Timna (Thamnatha), that called \"Kh. Tibne\" in south-western Samaria, in Mount Ephraim, about 14 kilometers (9 miles) northwest of Bethel.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the Mishnaic scholar, Simeon of Timnah, was born and raised in one of the two Timnahs during the waning years of the Second Temple period, based on the vowels assigned to his name, (). He is noted for saying: \"A bastard is anyone who is born from an [illegal] union for which his progenitors are liable to extirpation at the hands of heaven\" , and which teaching comes to exclude a single parent who gave birth to a child outside of wedlock, and whose child is often wrongly called \"bastard\" under common law.\n\nAs of 2018, the site at \"Kh. Tibbaneh\" has yet to be excavated. A cursory review of the site has revealed late Iron II sherds.\n\n\n"}

It is both culturally and geographically specific. It may be inherited, acquired by acclamation or action, or simply claimed. The extent of the power associated with the title varied; it might be limited to a small group in a specific place, or many people over large areas. In some cases the claim was clearly a public relations exercise. As the term Gypsy is also used in many different ways the \"King of the Gypsies\" may be someone with no connection with the Romani people. In the early 1970s, it was decided, at the First Annual Romani Meeting that the term Gypsy would no-longer be used to describe themselves. They voted for the term Roma to be used.\n\nIt has also been suggested that in places where they were persecuted by local authorities the \"King of the Gypsies\" is an individual, usually of low standing, who places himself in the risky position of an ad hoc liaison between the Romani and the gadje (non-Romani). The arrest of such a \"King\" limited the harm to the Romani people.\n\nJohnnie Faa of Dunbar was leader of the 'Egyptians', or Gypsies, in Scotland. Faa was granted a letter under the Privy Seal from King James IV in February 1540, which was renewed in 1553. It was addressed to \"oure louit Johnne Faw, lord and erle of Litill Egipt\" establishing his authority over all Gypsies in Scotland and calling on all sheriffs in the country to assist him \"in executione of justice upoun his company and folkis\", who were to \"conforme to the lawis of Egipt\".\n\nHe is resurrected in fiction in S. R. Crockett's \"The Raiders\" and in Philip Pullman's trilogy \"His Dark Materials\".\n\nSon and successor of Johnnie Faa, Johnne Wanne was granted Royal authority over all \"Egyptians\" in Scotland in May 1540. Records showed that by 1612 the Faa family had extended as far as Shetland. However, the initial tolerance of Gypsies did not last. In 1623 eight leaders of the Gypsies were hanged on the Burgh Muir, six of whom were of the Faa line. In the 1650s they were amongst those transported to Virginia.\n\nPatrick was the first recorded Gypsy King at Kirk Yetholm. Along with seven other Gypsies he was \"sentenced to be transported to the Queen's American for life.\"\n\nKing William I, known as 'Gleed Nickit Wull' because of a twist in the shape of his throat, was born about 1700, and died at Coldingham in 1784, aged around 84. He fathered 24 children by three wives. His death at Colingham is recounted by William Smith, the Baillie at Kelso, who states that \"When old Will Faa was upwards of eighty years of age, he called on me in Kelso, in his way to Edinburgh, telling me that he was going to Edinburgh to see the laird... before he died,\" and also that after successfully completing this visit \"he only got the length of Colingham, when he was taken ill and died.\" Will claimed to be descended from Johnnie Faa, Lord of Little Egypt.\n\nWill Faa, \"King of the Gypsies\", died in Kirk Yetholm on 9 October 1847, aged 96. He was the son of William Faa I. William Faa was an innkeeper (owned \"The Queen\") and footballer who lived at \"The Gypsy Palace\" off the Green, and entertained visitors there. The \"Kelso Mail\" carried his obituary entitled \"Death of a Gypsy King\", which said he was \"always accounted a more respectable character than any of his tribe, and could boast of never having been in gaol during his life.\" His house continued to be a tourist attraction, and there was reportedly an \"Old Palace\" on the other side of Kirk Yetholm Green. William died without issue in 1847 when the 'Crown' passed to his sister Esther's husband Charles Blythe (1775-1861). Charles was an educated man who did much to live up to his role. On his death in 1861 there was a tussle between his many children for the right to be monarch. The role went to his daughter Esther Faa Blythe who reigned until 1883 when the gypsy culture was in serious decline. Following a gap of several years in 1898 one of her sons Charles Rutherford was persuaded to accept the office and a ceremonial Gypsy Coronation was held in 1898. By this stage the role was largely an attempt to boost tourism.\nCharles died in 1902 and the title has not been re-established. An Edinburgh housewife is now thought to be the present 'Queen'. A lancet and case belonging to William Faa II can be found in the collections of the National Museum Scotland.\n\nCharles Faa Blythe was a brother-in-law to William Faa II, and when he died without issue the title of King of the Gypsies was passed to Charles, husband of his sister, Esther. Charles was born in 1775 and died in 1861. He was crowned King, by the local blacksmith, George Gladstone, on 25 October 1847, aged at least 70 years. He was succeeded by his daughter, Esther Faa Blythe, who was born in the early years of the 1800s and died on 12 July 1883.\n\nBorn around 1825, Charles Rutherford (known as Charles Faa Blythe II), was a son to Esther Faa Bythe, the Gypsy Queen. Between the death of Esther Faa Blyth in 1883 and the accession of Charles II in 1898, there was no Gypsy royalty crowned at Kirk Yetholm. His coronation ceremony was really a pageant, with all the locals dressing up for the benefit of the photographers. Many photographs of the occasion still exist. \n\nWilliam (Billy) Marshall (1672-1792) died aged 120, lived in Minnigaff, Kirkcudbrightshire, South West Scotland. Caird of Barullion, King of the Gypsies of the Western Lowlands for 89 years. Served as a soldier at the Battle of the Boyne for William of Orange, Battle of Blenheim. Returned to Scotland where he had an army of 200 followers who ruled the land between Ayr and Dumfries and fought battles at Newton of Ayr, Brig O Doon and Alloway. He was a Protestant, Covenanter, and Leveller. He and his army would champion, the poor, the dispossessed, and steal, disrupt, and organize smuggling activities in cattle, sheep, horses, brandy, whisky, tea, against Jacobites, Landlords, and those that were not locals who were known to him. He was an accomplished craftsman of horn spoons, cups, pots. He is buried in the graveyard at St Cuthbert's Church in Kirkcudbright.\n6 February 2018, AJMcC, The Tinkler Gypsies of Galloway, by Andrew McCormick\n\nOften referred as the Ecclesiast, his origins remain unknown but research indicates that he lived around the french territories of the South Gironde. Admired for his famous mystical beard, he became one of the central symbolic representations of authority for french gypsies, as many tales and legends were created and put together from diverse episodes taken from his life (e.g. Catherine's street hidden Church, the Ecclesiast and the last Gitardise, The drummer and the prince, the good, the bad and the Church, etc.). He was nominated by his predecessor, Joni Ali, in 1993 after the battle of the Golden Veal of Bazas, and was crowned after the death of its mentor on the 5th of may of the following year (Joni Ali's Day).\n\nThe short book \"Martin Markall, Beadle of the Bridewell\" was published in London in 1610. The author is given as \"S.R.\", who is usually identified as Samuel Rid the author of \"The Art of Jugling or Legerdemaine\", a later book of rogue literature promised in Martin Markall. The book is of dubious veracity, and large sections are taken from the works of Thomas Dekker, although Frank Aydelotte, who dates the book to 1608, calls it mostly original. It includes what purports to be a list of the leaders of \"the regiment of rogues\", which echoed the genealogies of prominent families. It will be seen that in reality few had anything to do with Gypsies, but they are indicative of the context in which some of the Kings of the Gypsies were identified.\n\naka Jack Cade, aka John Mortimer, who led a rebellion of men from Kent who camped at Blackheath outside London in 1450. After his rebellion a reward was offered for him, and he was captured and killed in Kent.\n\nBoth soldiers who had served in France. Bluebeard was captured and executed shortly after being made \"their captain\". Roberts then gathered about 100 \"rakehells and vagabonds\" in Kent who were joined by 400 \"masterless men\". Together they joined Jack Cade and entered Southwark. After the end of Cade's rebellion Roberts took to the woods with a small group living by theft, according to set rules of their own. After a year living like this these \"Roberdsmen\" dispersed throughout England, vowing to meet every three years, and joining other \"commotions and rebellions\". Roberts also went \"roving\" and \"kept his court\" until he was killed in 1461.\n\nWas chosen by the remaining \"Roberdsmen\" at \"their wonted place of meeting\" \"by general assent\". He was \"a wandering rogue\", \"much given to swearing, drunkenness and lechery . . . stout of stomach, audacious and fierce\". He claimed \"droit du seigneur\", and ordained that all beggars spent their weekly earnings in full every Saturday night. Rid says that he fought with \"300 tattered knaves\" in the rebellion in the South West of England against Edward IV and was killed at the Battle of Tewkesbury (1471). Unlike Roberts, who may have been a real character, this Cowdiddle seems to have been a complete fiction.\n\nNot deterred, the remaining \"Roberdsmen\" \"hie them to their rendezvous . . . and there, with the full consent of the whole company, they chose one Spising to be his successor\". Spising is given no first name. He is credited with ordering that all begging wanderers be \"stalled as a rogue\" by \"the Chief Commander then being\", paying a fee in beer, though this was excused if his father and grandfather had been rogues. Spising joined the larger rebellion by Thomas Neville, the Bastard of Fauconberg. He led a band attacking Aldgate, and was nearly successful, until parts of his group were trapped by the fall of the portcullis. Spising is reputed to have ruled 11 years before being hanged for a murder in Wombourn, Staffordshire, having escaped the same fate earlier by seeking sanctuary in Westminster Abbey. There is a historical record of a Spising as leader of an Essex contingent of Neville's uprising, but he was executed after it, and his head exhibited on Aldgate.\n\nWas the next elected, an expert at cheating with loaded dice, and excelled in \"all manner of vice\". He repeated Cowdiddle's requirement for thieves and beggars to spend their ill-gotten gains and not save them. Rid says he ruled for 8 years before dying of \"the [French] pox and Neapolitan scurf\". Like Cowdiddle, Dick seems to have been wholly fictional.\n\nLaurence Crossbiter was the next elected leader, a serving man aged 50–60. His art was \"crossbiting\"; theft from the customers of whores. He is also reported to have died \"his bowels . . . eaten out with the pox while he was yet alive\". Rid described him as cowardly and slavish for failing to come to the aid of the rebel Perkin Warbeck.\n\nWas one of Warbeck's counsellors, \"a noted knave\". He was next \"led to the wonted place of meeting, and there solemnly stalled a rogue and made their general\". He is described as formerly having been a tailor in Taunton, Somerset \"of proud and haughty disposition\", and have \"lived in this new government\" until 1501. A Skelton was recorded by Sir Francis Bacon as a counsellor to Warbeck, but he says nothing of his activities after the rebellion.\n\nWas elected his successor \"by the General Council\". Cock Lorel was \"the most notorious knave that ever lived\" who ruled until 1533. He professed the trade of a tinker to cover his thefts. Rid says that his knaveries are recorded in an old manuscript kept as \"Maunders’ Hall\", giving the rogue community a similar structure of that of the trade guilds.\nCock Lorel was the great mythical leader of Tudor rogues. His name means just that, \"cock\" being leader, and \"lorel\" or losel\" meaning rascal. He first appears about 1500 in \"Cock Lorel's Boat\", and is mentioned in Robert Copland's \"The Highway to the Spitalhouse\" (1535). He is credited with approving John Awdesley's \"The Fraternity of Vagabonds\", (1561), in which he is given as the creator of the Twenty Five Orders of Knaves, reproduced in Thomas Harman's \"Warning for Common Cursitors\" and many other works of rogue literature. There is no record of any real individual on whom he was based.\nCock Lorel is credited with having held a meeting with the leader of the Egyptians, Giles Hather, at their base at The Devils Arse Apeak in Derbyshire. Rid claims that at this meeting they devised a new and secret language Thieves' Cant, \"to the end that their cozenings, knaveries, and villainies might not so easily be perceived and known\".\n\nBecame head of the regiment or fellowship of Egyptians in the north about 1528. These, Rid says, travelled in groups of more than a hundred men and women, with horses, their faces blacked, and practised legerdemain and fortune telling by palmistry, delighting the common people with their clothes.\n\n\"the Queen of the Egypties\" accompanied Giles Hather, according to Rid. These names were traditional; Hather is mentioned by Thomas Awdesley (1561). \"Kit\" and \"Callot\" as names can be traced back to Piers Plowman. Although Tudor government, both local and national, took a close interest in the Egyptians there is no record of the names in their records.\n\nThe Boswells were for centuries one of England's largest and most important Gypsy families. The Boswell clan were a large extended family of Travellers, and in old Nottinghamshire dialect the word \"bos'll\" was used as a term for Travellers and Romani in general.\n\nWas the son of Francis Boswell.\n\n\"Alias king of the Gypsies\", from the St Margaret's Westminster, was tried at the Old Bailey on 28 August 1700 for theft with violence and highway robbery. It was alleged he had robbed \"one Rebecca Sellers, near the High way, . . . taking from her 3 Gold-rings, and 9 s. in Money\" in January of that year. The Jury found him Guilty of theft, but not Robbery, as \"It appeared that he juggled [tricked] her out of it.\" He was sentenced to Penal transportation.\n\nIs buried in Rossington, near Doncaster in Yorkshire. Langdale's \"Topographical Dictionary of Yorkshire\" (1822), says:\n\"In the church yard, was a stone, the two ends of which are now remaining, where was interred the body of James Bosvill the King of the Gypsies, who died January 30, 1708. For a number of years, it was a custom of Gypsies from the south, to visit his tomb annually, and there perform some of their accustomed rites; one of which was to pour a flagon of ale upon the grave.\"\nThis is similar to the ritual of \"stalling the rogue\" mentioned by Thomas Harman and in \"The Beggars Bush\" and by Bampfylde Moore Carew.\n\nA tradition was reported of annual visits to the grave of Charles Boswell near Doncaster for more than 100 years into the 1820s, including a rite of pouring a flagon of hot ale into the tomb. This may be same person. the grave is situated by the main door leading to the church, shaded by a dark oak tree. It is now covered in moss, but is still readable. The words \"King Of The Gypsies\" will lie there for ever more, whereas the mystery of the black cat is still unsolved. – information on the grave by A. Needham – P.

According to the caption of a photograph Xavier Petulengro cut the hands of the couple to mingle their blood during the ceremony. After their wedding the couple went north to Blackpool. During the war Leon was in the RAF and Ileana (Eileen) was a staff car driver for ICI. The marriage was dissolved in 1947 in Nottingham. Baildon was a famous fair and meeting place for Gypsies. Petulengro/ Smith was well known as a broadcaster on Gypsy subjects. His son Leon Petulengro/ Smith wrote for the \"Woman's Own\" magazine.\n\nBorn in Orpington, Kent early 20th century. Lived in Folkestone, Kent.\n\nLouis Welch of Darlington was described by British media as the \"King of the Gypsies\", a title given to the best bare-knuckled boxer in the Romanichal - mainly from the UK, and France community, following an alleged attack by six knife-wielding men, possibly from a rival band of travellers, in Cumbria. He refused to give evidence against his attackers, saying it was \"against the travellers' code of honour\", and a retrial was ordered after the jury failed to reach a verdict.\n\nAbram Wood was the head of a family of Welsh gypsies in the 1700s.

After Polykarp's death in 2001, his two sons publicly rivalled for the title \"King of All Gypsies in The World\", estimating 47.8 million subjects throughout the world and citing various ancient ceremonies and royal registries.\n\nThis \"King of the Gypsies\" is suggested as a possible model for \"A Grotesque Head\" of the sketches of human physiognomy by Leonardo da Vinci, dated to (c.1503-07). Giorgio Vasari reported that Leonardo had done a drawing of \"the Gypsy Captain Scaramuccia\" which Vasari possessed, but it is not known what happened to it.\n\nIn 1993, Iulian Rădulescu proclaimed himself \"Emperor of the Roma Everywhere\".\n\nFlorin Cioabă acquired the title \"King of the Roma Everywhere\" in 1997 from his father Ioan Cioabă who had claimed the title in 1992. Reports in 2003 that Cioabă, a Pentecostal Minister, had married off his own daughter at the age of 12 (or 14) caused uproar in the western media. The UN Economic and Social Council visited him in 1999 when preparing a report on Racism and Intolerance and described him as devoting himself to economic activity to support community projects, and exerting \"moral authority\" and having \"some influence\" as a councillor.\nHe died on August 18, 2013 after suffering a heart attack while on holiday in Antalya, Turkey. He was succeeded as King by his son Dorin Cioabă.\n\nIn 2003, according to a decree issued by Emperor Iulian, John Kyle was proclaimed \"International King of the Roma\".\n\nHe was named as voivode of the \"Pharaoh's People\" in 1496. He seems to have led a group of metalworkers, as he was supplying the Bishop of Pécs with cannonballs. He was almost certainly the same person granted privileges by the King of Poland and Lithuania in 1501, who also recognised the privileges of Wasili as leader of the \"Cyhany\"\nWas conferred the title \"King of the Gypsies\" by the Polish Royal Chancery in 1652, after the death of Janczy who had previously served as the head of the Roma. Later Kings of the Gypsies seem to have been appointed from the aristocracy.\n\nWas crowned as Janos I, King of the Gypsies, before thousands of people in 1937. He announced his intention to petition Benito Mussolini for land for a Romani settlement in East Africa.\n\nThe Gypsy King is associated with mythical powers of being able to part water with his sword, a spade, and his head, after it had been cut off, according to tales collected in 1981.\n\nWho had lived in Meridian, Mississippi, was chosen as King after Emil Mitchell's death in 1942.\n\nDescribed as king of the Gypsies at the time of the massive search for Elsie Paroubek. Mr. George was contacted in Argyle, Wisconsin, and taken to Joliet, Illinois for questioning; but he knew nothing and was released.\n\nIn 1953, Anaïs Nin underwent surgery for ovarian cancer in a Los Angeles hospital. In her diary, she mentions that \"the King of the Gypsies was having surgery at the same time\" and that approximately six hundred members of his tribe were camped in or near the hospital in accordance with their law: \"no amount of hospital discipline would drive them away\". She spoke with several members of the band, and identified them as Romani people.\n\nSince 1998, Angelo Vallerugo III has been accepted by the Venezuelan gypsy community as their one and only king.\n"}

The book was serialized in the Daily Mail and was a best seller. He used his books to propose several theories, including a belief that Jesus and Mary Magdalene had married and had children, whose descendants included King Arthur and the House of Stuart. In \"Lost Secrets of the Sacred Ark\" he claimed that the Ark of the Covenant was a machine for manufacturing \"monatomic gold\" – a supposed elixir which could be used to extend life. His books also included theories about Freemasonry, the Knights Templar, The Holy Grail and proposed connections between Atenism and Judaism.\n\nGardner referred to himself as \"Chevalier Labhran de Saint Germain\", and \"Presidential Attache to the European Council of Princes\" (the existence of which cannot be verified) also \"Prior of the Celtic Churches Sacred Kindred of Saint Columbia\". He also claimed to be Jacobite Historiographer Royal of the Royal House of Stewart. He was an endorser of Michael Lafosse, in particular his claims to be descended from the House of Stuart, which Gardner claimed was descended from Jesus Christ.\n\nHistorians and scholars regard him as a conspiracy theorist, and treat his work as pseudohistory.

{"id": "56238832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56238832", "title": "Maungapohatu", "text": "Maungapohatu\n\nMaungapohatu is a settlement in the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand's North Island. Located in a remote area of the Urewera bush country about north of Lake Waikaremoana, it was founded by Rua Tapunui Kenana in 1907 and was substantially rebuilt twice during the next two decades. At its peak more than 500 people lived there but today it is once more a very sparsely populated place.\n\nIt lies at the foot of the 1366 metre mountain of the same name, which is sacred to the Tūhoe \"iwi\".\n\nTe Urewera is a thickly forested hill country to the northeast of Lake Taupo. It is the historical home of the Tūhoe, an \"iwi\" known for their stance on Māori sovereignty. Today, much of the land is contained within Te Urewera National Park, which has an area of and which in 2013 had a population of only 2,133. The State Highway 38 is the only major arterial road that crosses it, running from Waiotapu near Rotorua via Murupara to Wairoa.\n\nBecause of its isolation and dense forest, Te Urewera remained largely untouched by British colonists until the early 20th century; in the 1880s it was still in effect under Māori control and few Pākehā were prepared to risk entering the area.\n\nFollowing Premier Richard Seddon’s visit to Te Urewera in 1894 the Tūhoe chief Tutakangahau requested a Union Flag from the government. This flew at the Maungapohatu marae from at least 1897. The words “Kotahi Te Ture/Mo Nga Iwi E Rua/ Maungapōhatu” (One law/for both peoples/Maungapōhatu) were stitched onto it and it had been created as a sign of a peaceful relationship with the Crown. The words were chosen to affirm “the important principle that the dominant culture should not pass laws discriminating against Māori.”\n\nRua Tapunui Kenana, a grandson of Tutakangahau, was a Māori prophet, faith healer and land rights activist. He claimed to have been born in 1869 at Maungapohatu, although this is disputed. His father was killed fighting for Te Kooti, a guerrilla fighter and the founder of the Ringatū religion.\n\nBrought up amongst the Tūhoe Rua left in 1887 and worked on sheep stations in the Gisborne and Bay of Plenty districts. After a mystical experience on the mountain of Maungapohatu, Rua claimed to be the successor to Te Kooti and the Māori brother of Christ. On 12 April 1906 he prophesied that on 25 June he would \"ascend the throne\" and that King Edward VII would arrive at Gisborne. When the King failed to appear, Rua announced: \"I am really that King. Here I am, with all my people.\" Rua then returned to Maungapohatu where he set himself up as a prophet and announced his plan for the creation of the City of God at Maungapohatu. \n\nThe construction of Maungapohatu was to be a conscious recreation of the biblical city of Jerusalem. The population called themselves the \"Iharaira\", the Israelites, and Rua took the name \"Moses\". The construction of the community was to mark the beginning of their trials and a test their faithfulness. Maungapohatu was their \"City of Redemption. Here, one day, the promises would all be completed and the confiscated lands and the autonomy of the people restored\".\n\nRua arrived at this isolated outpost as the winter of 1907 set in. During the first year the potato crop failed and there were no pigs to be had. At least fifty people died that winter, most of them children, from the inadequacy of the houses, an outbreak of typhoid which came from the valley camps, and a measles epidemic which devastated the community. Sometimes there was nothing to eat but huhu, and the coarse toi leaves, normally used only for clothing. Nonetheless, from this inauspicious beginning the community struggled on to a first summer of plenty. Two groups had come together to build \"te pa tapu o te atua\", the sacred pā of the Lord; about half the entire Tuhoe tribe; and the Whakatohea, who through confiscation were almost landless. To signify the union between these two Mataatua tribes, Rua constructed the \"House of the Lord\", \"Hiruharama Hou\", built with two gables. One side was for the Tuhoe and the other for the Whakatohea. \n\nBuilt between 1907-1908, Maungapohatu \"was an impressive settlement with its own courthouse, bank, and council room. The streets were lit with oil lamps and it had its own water system, with separated pools for washing and cooking. The families set up their own rules of conduct, which were enforced through a council of elders and their prophet leader. In these first years, about 500 or 600 people lived at Maungapohatu.\" Rua attempted to create a new system of land ownership and land usage with a strong communal basis but which also emphasised the concept of family ownership of property. \n\nThe concepts of \"tapu and noa\" were central to the design, with different sections to reflect these two ideas. The sacred area, which included the civic amenities and sleeping houses was called the \"wahi tapu\" and fenced off from the surrounding \"noa\" area where buildings for the preparation of food and other mundane activities were built. The Bible was also a significant influence. The \"Hiruharama Hou\" was inspired by the instructions David had been given for Solomon's House as described in the Books of Chronicles and Kings.\n\nA two-storied structure called the Hīona (Zion) was constructed that became the parliament from where community affairs were administered. This circular meeting house was decorated with a design of blue clubs (Rua's personal symbol) and yellow diamonds, and stood within the inner sanctum of the pa. This was Rua's “Council Chamber and Court House” – also known as “Rua's Temple”. Rua thought it was modelled on the Jerusalem Temple (even though his chamber was not to be a place of worship), but the actual model was the present day Dome of the Rock on Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a Muslim holy site. The internal design with its two doors, winding staircase and \"windows of narrow lights\" was more solidly based on the biblical record. The unique cylindrical shape was a radical departure from traditional North Island Maori architecture.\n\nHowever, the authorities saw Rua Kenana as a disruptive influence and targeted him with the Tohunga Suppression Act of 1907, which banned traditional Māori healers from using herbs and other healing methods which were part of their traditional medicine. By 1908 Rua's struggle for power had brought the Tuhoe to the brink of civil war and the Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward intervened in an attempt to curb the prophet's influence.\n\nBy the close of 1913, Maungapohatu had declined. The Whakatohea had left and it had become a community of about 30 families. In 1914 the community broke up of its own accord and 20,000 acres which the Tuhoe had set aside in 1907, to be “a habitation for God and man”, were partitioned. Rua left and the Hiona was abandoned and became used as a hay store. In 1914 a new meeting house in a more traditional style was built -\"Tane Nui A Rangi\" - ‘Great Tāne of the Heavens’. Even so, controversy was seldom far away. Rua was fined for sly grogging in 1910 and in 1915 served a short gaol sentence for a similar offence. On his return from prison he attempted to reconstruct Maungapohatu. The pa, abandoned circa 1913, was rebuilt with the help of hundred men who worked for three hours each day for three days, \"a ritual resurrection of a new and more perfect community\". This came in tandem with a relaxation of various \"tapu\" observances including the dismantling of the fence between the \"tapu\" and \"noa\" areas.\n\nRua attempted to persuade the Tuhoe to boycott military service during the First World War. This was taken by the establishment as sedition and finally gave the Government and Rua's detractors the incentive to intervene against him and the Maungapohatu community. On 2 April 1916, seventy heavily armed police officers arrived to arrest Rua. Because the village was so remote, the police came well-equipped, using wagons and pack-horses, and camped on the way. \n\nThere are conflicting versions of what took place when the police arrived. There was no violent resistance from Rua personally but he refused to submit to arrest, and his supporters fought a brisk half-hour gun battle with the police. In this exchange, Rua's son Toko and a Māori bodyguard were killed and two Māori and four constables were wounded. When the hostilities ceased, Rua was arrested and transported to Rotorua. He was eventually found not guilty of sedition but guilty of “moral resistance” to the police and sentenced to 12 months hard labour to be followed by 18 months imprisonment. He served 9 months in Mt Eden Prison, Auckland.\n\nThe costs of defence at the various trials had ruined the community financially as it had to sell stock and land to meet the debt. The community was even ordered to pay the costs of the entire police operations and raid at Maungapohatu. Although the supreme court had found Rua's arrest illegal and a legal petition had been drafted to Parliament on 1 May 1917 on behalf of the Maungapohatu people calling for a full public inquiry into the events of April 1916, the behaviour of the police there and the subsequent intimidation of witnesses, no compensation was ever offered. \n\nWhen Rua returned to the Urewera, the settlement was divided, the lands overgrown and much of the community had relocated. The Presbyterian Mission under Rev. John Laughton had moved into Maungapohatu and was teaching Presbyterian Christianity and pākehā value systems. Rua had banned pākehā schools from the original community but a circular schoolhouse, described as being “in the most isolated spot where any school is maintained in New Zealand” was still in active use in the early 1920s. Possibly as part of a ritual purification Rua had both the \"Hiruharama Hou\" and the \"Hiona\" destroyed. A typhoid epidemic broke out at in the community in early in 1925 and after Laughton left in 1926 Rua organised the construction of a whole village for the third and final time. The new design reflected Rua Kenana's transition from a style of Old Testament prophet to that of New Testament pacifist. Houses of slab and shingle with galvanised iron roofs were built. There were two main streets and the houses were grouped carefully along them. He claimed this rebuilding was to prepare for the end of the world but when this failed to happen he blamed his followers. Eventually he moved downstream to Matahi in the eastern Bay of Plenty, where he lived until his death in 1937.\" \n\nNonetheless, the community continued to thrive for a while, facilities including two tennis courts and an open-air dance floor. Between 1927 and 1929 Maungapohatu had a population of about 150 and this period was remembered fondly by those who lived there. However, by 1936 the population had declined to 21 families. Binney (1983) notes that the main reasons for the long term decline of the settlement included the difficulties of finding paid work while living at such a remote location, the nature of the terrain, which is \"fiercely daunting for farming\", and the community's inability to find any sources of capital for redevelopment. \"The poor had subsidised the state, but the state had remained substantially indifferent to them.\"\n\nDuring the 1930s two botanists, the \"Tramping Girls of Auckland\", Lucy Cranwell and Lucy Moore conducted a field trip to research the flora of Mt. Maungapohatu. Cranwell wrote \"we set off at 3 am in a PDW truck back to the Papatotara Saddle and from there trudged the deep-worn horse track across three steep ridges to Rua's Pa at the base of our mountain ... an almost vertical surveyer's route took us to the flattish summit just as the sun was setting. When dawn came the mountain plants were covered with a delicate layer of frost.\"\n\nNgāi Tūhoe had donated 16,000ha of land to the government in 1922 so that roads could be built to connect Maungapohatu with the eastern Bay of Plenty and Ruatahuna but they were not constructed. In 1964 a road was finally built to the tiny settlement by a timber company and more than 1500 people attended the opening celebrations. For a few years the milling operations brought \"modest prosperity to this isolated and impoverished area, which had never recovered from the exodus of most of its inhabitants\" after the close of Rua's experiments in collective living. Little now remains of Maungapohatu, the population of which was estimated at only 15 in the 1960s.\n\nIn 2006 the annual synod of the Diocese of Waiapu passed a motion apologising for the Anglican Church's role in the 1907 Tohunga Suppression Act and in May of that year Archbishop Brown Turei and other church members made a pilgrimage to Maungapohatu. The church also announced plans to contribute to the rebuilding of the Maungapohatu marae. In 2014 the Maungapōhatu flag, which had been removed by the police in 1916 at the time of Rua Kenana's arrest, was returned by Auckland Museum to the Tūhoe as part of \"the Museums’ commitment to addressing historic ownership issues associated with taonga.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11015337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11015337", "title": "Richard MacNeish", "text": "Richard MacNeish\n\nRichard Stockton MacNeish (April 29, 1918 – January 16, 2001), known to many as \"Scotty\", was an American archaeologist. His fieldwork revolutionized the understanding of the development of agriculture in the New World and the prehistory of several regions of Canada, the United States and Central and South America. He pioneered new methods in fieldwork and materials analysis and brought attention to the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. His legacy has influenced generations of archaeologists.\n\nRichard Stockton MacNeish was born April 29, 1918 in New York City. His interest in archaeology started at a young age, sparked by a hastily created report on the Maya for an art history class when he was twelve. A year later he wrote to prominent Maya archaeologist Dr. A.V. Kidder asking for a job at his dig at Chichen Itza. Although his request was gently refused, Kidder encouraged MacNeish to study hard and become an archaeologist.\n\nIn 1936, MacNeish started his university career at Colgate College (now Colgate University) and participated in several archaeological field schools in New York and Arizona where he learned important excavation skills that he would later modify to create his own excavation techniques. Of this time, MacNeish writes: “My energy was boundless: I dug, I hiked, I climbed cliffs, I learned, I went to dances, I mixed cement by hand, I caught rattlesnakes, I packed mules. Most important, I did and talked archaeology morning, noon, and night – and loved every moment of it”. He continued to be influenced by Dr. Kidder, and refined his field archaeology methods under George Brainerd, eventually forming his personal excavation technique La Perre.\n\nAt the urging of several Southwestern archaeologists, MacNeish prepared to transfer to the University of Chicago to study under Fay-Cooper Cole. Before doing so, however, he had an unrelated feat to achieve. As a child, his mother enrolled him in boxing lessons and he had become quite accomplished. Now, he wanted to win a Golden Gloves championship. He did so in New York in 1938, wearing a kilt in the final bout as a tribute to his Scottish ancestry. This skill continued to provide him with spending money during his student years. \nAt the University of Chicago, he participated in field schools that exposed him to the methods and theories of James A. Ford, William Haag, Jesse D. Jennings, John Cotter, Glen Black, Tom Lewis, and Madeline Kneberg. In addition, he was heavily influenced by Julian Steward’s \"Basin-Plateau Aboriginal Sociopolitical Groups\" (1938). He earned his B.A. in 1940, his M.A. in 1944 and his Ph.D. in 1949. That same year, while working in the Sierra de Tamaulipas, Mexico, MacNeish discovered primitive teosinte corncobs in context with human habitations dating back several thousand years. This achievement spurred his lifelong interest in the origins of agriculture and society that would take him throughout Central and South America, eventually to China and, nearly, to Turkey. This last trip was put on hold when doctors ordered him to rest after a mild heart attack. After a long, varied and influential career, Richard MacNeish at age 83 died on January 16, 2001 in a car accident while touring Pre-Columbian Maya sites in Belize.\n\nShortly before his transfer to Chicago, during continued fieldwork in Arizona, MacNeish set out his future goals. “First I would learn to dig well and skillfully, then I would become able to analyze archaeological findings, and finally I would become a theoretician”. It was during his fieldwork as an undergraduate and graduate student that he worked on his first goal. At field schools across the United States, MacNeish absorbed the knowledge and techniques of anyone he worked with. Synthesis of this knowledge came to fruition during fieldwork in the state of Tamaulipas in Mexico. Here MacNeish made one of his important contributions to the field methods of archaeologists, fulfilling his first goal. He pioneered a method of excavating caves that involved the stripping the strata off alternate squares from a vertical profile. This allowed for greater detail and more meaningful divisions of an excavation. Where many previous methods involved digging by arbitrary levels, the new method — dubbed the La Perre technique after the cave in which it was first developed — dug each distinct strata, or floor, separately.\n\nHis discovery in these caves of very early maize domestication evidence also brought home to him the importance of interdisciplinary studies as he struggled to get dating and identification information on his samples. He realized that in getting an education archaeologists, “…spend much of their time learning phonemics, personality and culture, esoteric kinship systems, strange customs of primitive peoples, and so forth and do not have time for fields like botany, zoology, pollen analysis, soils, and geology – all disciplines they will have to use”. In order to rectify this, MacNeish began to involve experts outside of archaeology in many of his field studies. This policy was very well demonstrated in his excavations in the Tehuacan Valley and Ayacucho, Peru which resulted in multi-volume publications which analyzed the sites “utilizing the skills of all appropriate scientific fields”.\n\nIn 1949, MacNeish went to work for the National Museum of Canada. With this he began a system of spending his summers surveying and excavating in Northern and Western Canada and his winters searching for evidence of the origins of agriculture across Central America. “MacNeish enjoyed saying ‘I have as much sense as a duck – I fly south in the winter’”. Realizing that a random search for sites over these huge swathes of territory would be difficult and inefficient, he pioneered a five-step process that was based on making and then testing hypotheses about ancient environments and human behavior in them. These steps were:\nUsing this process, he discovered hundreds of new sites and gained a reputation for “lucky” finds, while actually advancing the scientific foundation of archaeology.\n\nMacNeish added to the understanding and analysis of archaeological materials through the championing of the interdisciplinary approach. In addition, his work on the standardization and computerization of lithic-attribute terminology enabled more sophisticated statistical analysis and generalization of the results. His ceramic analysis helped to reevaluate the prehistory of the Iroquois, disputing the idea that they had developed elsewhere and then migrated into their historic territory. His method of analysis demonstrated continuity between historic period groups and prehistoric complexes in the same areas.\n\nIn addition to the field and lab work MacNeish has been a professor at Boston University and the University of Calgary, where he helped to found their Department of Archaeology. He was the Whidden Lecturer at McMaster University, Senior Archaeologist at the National Museum of Canada, and was the director of the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology in Andover, Massachusetts. When he left the museum in 1983, instead of retiring, he established the Andover Foundation for Archaeological Research (AFAR), named himself Director of Research and continued his work in the American Southwest and China.\n\nIn the 1960s, MacNeish discovered the Coxcatlan Cave in Puebla, Mexico. This was a very important site of early maize domestication.\n\nIt is due to his extensive study that much of the historical and cultural record there was established, especially from the Archaic period when the cave was most active. The cave produced domesticated plants dated between 5,000 and 3,400 BC, including maize. At that time, the people and animals living in Tehuacan Valley divided their time between small hunting encampments and large temporary villages.\n\nMacNeish was awarded honorary degrees from the Universidad de San Cristobal de Huamanga in Ayacucho, Peru and Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada. He was elected to the National Academy of Science, British Academy of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. He served as President of the Society for American Archaeology and has received numerous awards, including the Kidder Medal from the American Anthropological Association, the Spinden Medal for Archaeology from the Smithsonian Institution, and the Fiftieth Anniversary Award for Outstanding Contributions to American Archaeology from the Society for American Archaeology. In 1977 he was awarded the Cornplanter Medal for his work in Iroquois research. In addition he has been honored by institutions for his work in Mexico and China.\n\nMacNeish’s ultimate goal was to make archaeology more of a science. He was a processual archaeologist who championed the necessity of experimental archaeology and hypothesis testing in the exploration of human cultural ecology. By adopting, creating or championing methods that made archaeological results more generalizable and amenable to hypothesis testing MacNeish was attempting to learn, and teach, about the broader patterns of social change that can inform our choices in the future; he wished to use archaeology to improve the human condition. “…laws of cultural change may be of use not only in explaining the past, but more important, in predicting the future or at least indicating the steps in cultural change we might take in the future”. His ultimate legacy, the sum total of all of his individual accomplishments in methodology and theory, was his commitment to archaeology as a science that could produce laws and theories to aid humanity in the future. In his autobiographical discussion of American archaeology (1978), MacNeish writes, “We are still fumbling along, perfecting techniques as well as improving methodology, and our field – as well as I – have a long way to go”.\n\nMacNeish was constantly calling for others to question his conclusions and improve his methods to further advance the science of archeology and its ability to speak to society’s needs. As a result, his greatest legacy is probably his influence on and encouragement of students, other archaeologists and professionals he worked with. One of these students, Barry Rolett, recalls how “MacNeish encouraged and invested his time in students like me because he loved to share the excitement of archaeology” and “led by example and he used his considerable influence more to help others than for his own personal gain”.\n\nBy his own accounting, Richard MacNeish “spent 8,071 days in the field and wrote more than 9 million words”. His many publications include: \n\n"}

He lost the greater part of his ancestral estates to Cromwellian confiscations in the 1650s. The remainder was stolen through deception, by his son's father-in-law, Richard \"Nimble Dick\" Martin of Ross. He died in poverty at Park, near Bearna.\n\nUniquely among the Ó Flaithbheartaigh family up to that time, Ruaidhri became a highly regarded historian and collector of Irish manuscripts. His friends and associates included his teacher Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh; Daibhidh Ó Duibhgheannáin; Dr. John Lynch; Edward Lluyd; Samuel Moleneaux and his father William. His published works included \"Ogyia\" and \"Iar Connacht\".\n\nHe is perhaps most often associated with his elaborate history of Ireland, \"Ogygia\", published in 1685 as \"Ogygia: seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia & etc.\", in 1793 translated into English by Rev. James Hely, as\n\nOgygia is the island of Calypso, used by O'Flaherty as an allegory for Ireland. Drawing from numerous ancient documents, \"Ogygia\" traces Irish history back to the ages of mythology and legend, before the 1st century. The book credits Milesius as the progenitor of the Goidelic people. O'Flaherty had included in his history what purported to be an essay on the understanding of the ancient Ogham alphabet. Based on the 1390 \"Auraicept na n-Éces\", he stated that each letter was named after a tree, a concept widely accepted in 17th century Ireland.\n\n\"Ogygia\" was immediately criticised for its scholarship by Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh (1636–91), Dean of Faculty (1682) at Aberdeen. The arguments about O'Flaherty's continued well into the 18th century, culminating in the 1775 \"The Ogygia Vindicated\" by the historian Charles O'Conor, in which he adds explanatory footnotes to the original work.\n\nDr. Thomas Molyneux visited Ó Flaithbheartaigh on Wednesday 21 April 1709 and left the following eye-witness account- \"I went to vizit old Flaherty, who lives, very old, in a miserable condition at Park, some 3 hours west of Gallway, in Hiar or West-Connaught. I expected to have seen here some old Irish manuscripts, but his ill fortune has stripp'd him of these as well as his other goods, so that he has nothing now left but some few of his own writing, and a few old rummish books of history printed. In my life I never saw so strangely stony and wild a country. I did not see all this way 3 living creatures, not one house or ditch, not one bit of corn, nor even, I might say, a bit of land, for stones: in short nothing appear'd but stones and sea, nor could I conceive an inhabited country so destitute of all signs of people and art as this is.\"\n\nHe was survived by his daughters, and a son, Micheal Ó Flaithbheartaigh.\n\n\n\n"}

He was highly active in literary media, sitting on the editorial boards of several publications. He has also been described as the most important dramatist from before the Indonesian National Revolution.\n\nPane was born in Muara Sipongi, Tapanuli, Dutch East Indies, on 14 November 1905 to a Muslim family. He began his education in two primary schools in Sibolga, before continuing to middle school, first in Padang, then in Batavia (modern day Jakarta). While in Jakarta, Pane published his first poem, \"Tanah Air\" (\"Homeland\"), in the magazine \"Jong Soematra\". After graduating in 1922, he attended the Gunung Sari Teachers' College until 1925; upon graduation, he taught at the college for several years and took a year to study law.\n\nIn 1929, Pane moved to India, where he spent a year studying the culture of India. After his return to the Indies in 1930, Pane became a member of the editorial staff of \"Timboel\" magazine as well as a teacher. In 1933, his younger brother Armijn called on him to work on the new literary magazine, \"Poedjangga Baroe\"; Pane accepted. In 1934 he was fired as a teacher due to his membership in the Indonesian National Party.\n\nPane continued to be active in literary circles, joining the editorial board of \"Panorama\" in the early 1930s, together with Liem Koen Hian, Amir Sjarifuddin and Mohammad Yamin. \"Panorama\" was a newspaper belonging to Siang Po Press, a publishing house owned by the Dutch-educated jurist and politician Phoa Liong Gie. In mid-1936, together with his colleagues Liem, Sjarifuddin and Yamin, Pane started another newspaper, \"Kebangoenan\" (1936–1941), which was also published by Phoa's Siang Po Printing Press.\n\nTogether with Armijn, Adam Malik, and Sumanang, on 13 December 1937 Pane founded the news agency Antara; after independence, Antara became Indonesia's official news agency. From 1941 to 1942, Pane edited the magazine \"Indonesia\", published by the state-owned publisher Balai Pustaka. While working with Balai Pustaka, Pane would refuse employee benefits such as free rice and a shuttle service, instead choosing to walk to work and buy his own rice.\n\nAfter the Japanese invaded the Indies, Pane became the head of the Central Cultural Office.\n\nPane died in Jakarta on 2 January 1968. Before he died, he requested that his body be treated in a Hindu manner; however, his family did not grant the request as they felt it would be against Islamic teachings.\n\nPane's poems used everyday language, including foreign loanwords. He limited his use of the local languages of Indonesia, including his native language Batak. Structurally, his poems resembled the old Malay form \"pantun\", although he also wrote several sonnets. Many of his poems dealt with philosophical issues. Indonesian writer and literary critic Muhammad Balfas calls Pane the \"first [Indonesian poet] who used his poetry to reveal his inner self\".\n\nPane viewed Western cultures as being too materialistic, focusing on the physical aspects of life; Eastern cultures, on the other hand, he viewed as being more spiritualistic. He saw this as influencing the way in which humans interacted with nature, with Westerners seeking to conquer it and Easterners preferring to adapt to it. In one polemic in response to fellow \"Poedjangga Baroe\" editor Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, who was decidedly pro-Western, Pane compared the West to Faust, who sold his soul to the devil for worldly pleasure and knowledge, and the East to Arjuna, who searched for a spiritual truth. Pane did, however, admit that Western technology could bring a positive change.\n\nPane was elder brother to writer Armijn Pane and Lafran Pane, the latter of whom founded the Indonesian Muslim Students' Association. With his wife, Pane had six children. Pane's religious views have been described as being a \"composite of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Javanese philosophy\".\n\nPane was reportedly very modest, telling J. U. Nasution – who at the time was in the midst of writing a biography on Pane – that he was nothing and should not be interviewed. On another occasion, he refused a Satya Lencana Kebudayaan award from President Sukarno, stating that Indonesia had given him everything but he had done nothing for it.\n\nBalfas called Pane the most important Indonesian dramatist from before the national revolution.\n\n\n\n"}

Several months later, the General Satellite Corporation started building a plant in Gusev to manufacture household electronics products. The agreement between the mayor of Gusev, Nikolay Tsukanov, and the president of the General Satellite Corporation, Andrey Tkachenko, was signed in 2008, in order to create a modern industrial park in the city. The idea was approved by local authorities and was presented at the International Investment Forum \"Sochi-2008\".\n\nThe decision to locate the new production facilities in Gusev, according to Andrey Tkachenko, was made for two reasons. \nFirst, the experience of the first similar plant that had been working in Gusev as part of the special economic zone - the official residence of the Corporation - was successful. Second, the administration of the city took a great interest in cooperation for the creation of Technopolis and in a comprehensive solution to the problem of the territory development.\n\nIn 2009, two plants, JSC NPO Digital Television Systems (DTS) and Prankor, Ltd., were run - their products have no analogues in Russia.

The average payroll should be 1.95 billion, which will \"swallow\" almost 40% of the capital raised. The establishment of such an Industrial Park is possible only if stringent standards and practices are observed in the construction and cash flow.

When such disparate hierarchies within the EU find common goals, typically within a conterminous geographic area, they seek to achieve them by integrating their various policies and activities. The goals of transnational governance, especially for areas previously divided by the Iron Curtain or pre-EU barriers to free trade and movement of peoples, is to foster economic and social development.\n\nThe economic development could be defined as the increased of wealth of a country or a region and the social development could be loosely defined as the improvements of quality of living for the population. Economic and social are, or at least should be, inseparable concepts. Why reach a high economic development if the inhabitants living in the area don’t see any benefits of that improvement?\n\nIn the current global political and economic landscape, particularly within the backdrop of globalization, there is an increase in privatization. This means that business has started to play an important role in the international order. A related phenomenon called public-private partnerships (PPPs) is seen as an offshoot of this development. \n\nCritics, however, cite that a dominance of the private sector and the global capital in the world today is dangerous since it tends to undermine international cooperation and equity among states. There is global consensus, therefore, regarding the need for transnational governance that can regulate and address the gaps on global issues and crises like poverty, climate change, disease, terrorism, and financial crises, among others. The state-centric Westphalian international order is unable to cope with these transnational threats, calling for multilateral collaboration that does not only involve states but also other international actors such as non-governmental organizations and multinational companies.\n\nReach social and economic developments are already a challenging but it’s even more challenging in a transnational area such as the greater region. Some projects were created in order to foster these developments. The operational program Interreg IV A, “grande region” has for main objectives to make the greater region more attractive, encourage innovation, improve the numbers of high quality jobs, etc.\n\nThe improvement of the economic and social situation could be analysed through the example of the Vienna-Bratislava-Györ triangle which is a cross border area including three countries (Slovakia, Austria and Hungary) that were once part of the same empire. Good governance could lead to the adoption of a common identity which could lead to mutual support between people, companies or authorities sharing this common identity. Concretely, we observe a high amount of Foreign direct investments (FDI) coming from Austria in order to develop the general situation of Slokia and Hungary. This is very well descriptor in this citation of Tatzberger (2007) : “Foreign direct investments (FDI) play an important role in restructuring and improving the competitiveness of industry and manufacturing by helping to raise productivity and to expand exports. It has been one of the driving forces behind industrial restructuring in Hungary and Slovakia”.\n\nHowever, it has to be said to huge economic and social disparities could be seen a real threat to the process leading to the creation of a common identity. For instance, the migration of workers stays underdeveloped because of Austrian fears and restrictions. On one side workers mobility is seen as an important force in enhancing economic integration of the region but on the other side it could lead to real changes in the social structure especially in Austria due to the migration of very low qualified workers. An important brain drain could also appear which will make highly decrease the number of educated people who could have been able to develop and teach regional strategic development plan.\n\n\nGabriele Tatzberger, Territorial Cohesion and the European Model of Society (Book), The Vienna-Bratislava-Györ Triangle The European Model of Society in Action, edited by Andreas Faludi\n"}

The two-stage theory was applied to countries worldwide which had not passed through the capitalist stage.\n\nThe discussion on stagism focuses on the Russian Revolution. However, Maoist theories, such as New Democracy, tend to apply a two-stage theory to struggles elsewhere. In the Soviet Union the two-stage theory was opposed by the Trotskyist theory of permanent revolution.\n\nIn Marxist–Leninist theory under Stalin the theory of two stages gained a revival. More recently, the South African Communist Party and Socialist Alliance (Australia) have re-elaborated the two-stage theory, although the Socialist Alliance differentiates their position from the Stalinist one.\n\nThe two-stage theory is often attributed to Marx and Engels, but critics such as David McLellan and others dispute that Marx and Engels envisaged the strict application of this theory outside of the actually existing Western development of capitalism.\n\nAlthough all agree that Marx and Engels argue that Western capitalism provides the technological advances necessary for socialism and the \"grave diggers\" of the capitalist class in the form of the working class, critics of the two-stage theory, including most trends of Trotskyism, counter that Marx and Engels denied that they had laid down a formula to be applied to all countries in all circumstances. McLellan and others cite Marx's \"Reply to Mikhailovsky\":\n\nIn the Preface to the Russian edition of the \"Communist Manifesto\" of 1882, Marx and Engels specifically outline an alternative path to socialism for Russia.\n\nIn Russia, the Mensheviks believed the two-stage theory applied to Tsarist Russia. They were criticised by Trotsky in what became the theory of Permanent Revolution in 1905. Later when the two-stage theory re-appeared after the death of Lenin in the Soviet Union, the theory of Permanent Revolution was supported by the Left Opposition. The Permanent Revolution argues that the tasks allotted in the two-stage theory to the capitalist class can only be carried out by the working class with the support of the poor peasantry, and that the working class will then pass on to the socialist tasks and expropriate the capitalist class. The revolution cannot pause here, however, and must remain \"permanent\" in the sense that it must seek worldwide revolution to avoid isolation and thus move towards international socialism.\n\n"}

His theory, published in 1959 in \"The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome\", rekindled the interest in social evolutionism and is counted prominently among the neoevolutionists. He believed that culture – meaning the sum total of all human cultural activity on the planet – was evolving. White differentiated between three components of culture: technological, sociological and ideological, and argued that it was the technological component which plays a primary role or is the primary determining factor responsible for the cultural evolution. White's materialist approach is evident in the following quote: \"man as an animal species, and consequently culture as a whole, is dependent upon the material, mechanical means of adjustment to the natural environment\". This technological component can be described as material, mechanical, physical and chemical instruments, as well as the way people use these techniques. White’s argument on the importance of technology goes as follows:\n\nFor White “the primary function of culture” and the one that determines its level of advancement is its ability to “harness and control energy.” White's law states that the measure by which to judge the relative degree of evolvedness of culture was the amount of energy it could capture (energy consumption). White differentiates between five stages of human development. In the first, people use energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use energy of domesticated animals. In the third, they use the energy of plants (so White refers to agricultural revolution here). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness nuclear energy. White introduced a formula \n\nwhere E is a measure of energy consumed per capita per year, T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilising the energy and C represents the degree of cultural development. In his own words: “\"the basic law of cultural evolution\"” was “\"culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased\".” Therefore \"we find that progress and development are affected by the improvement of the mechanical means with which energy is harnessed and put to work as well as by increasing the amounts of energy employed\". Although White stops short of promising that technology is the panacea for all the problems that affect mankind, like technological utopians do, his theory treats technological factor as the most important factor in the evolution of society and is similar to the later works of Gerhard Lenski, the theory of Kardashev scale of Russian astronomer, Nikolai Kardashev and to some notions of technological singularity.\n"}

The French included some women, both Muslim and French, in their war effort, but they were not as fully integrated, nor were they charged with the same breadth of tasks as their Algerian sisters. The total number of women involved in the conflict, as determined by post-war veteran registration, is numbered at 11,000, but it is possible that this number was significantly higher due to underreporting.\n\nThere exists a distinction between two different types of women who became involved: urban and rural. Urban women, who constituted about twenty percent of the overall force, had received some kind of education and usually chose to enter on the side of the FLN of their own accord. Largely illiterate rural women, on the other hand (the remaining eighty percent), became involved due to geographical proximity to FLN operations paired with force, although some of them did join out of compassion.\n\nThe rural women combatants in the Algerian War were referred to as the mujahidat and \"left their homes and families to join the FLN armed guerrilla bands, the Armée Libération Nationale (ALN)\". They tended to be young, unmarried, and prepared to join the resistance \"with or without the approval of their families\". The mujahidat also were \"social assistants to the rural population in the zones in which they were posted and would give local female peasants advice on topics such as hygiene and education\". They also had important political responsibilities as many of these female combatants promoted the FLN by \"organizing political meetings with local women\".\n\nThe urban women combatants were referred to as the fidayat and largely \"engaged in paramilitary activities in the urban centres\".\n\nWomen operated in various areas during the course of the rebellion. Meredith Turshen claims, “Women participated actively as combatants, spies, fundraisers, as well as nurses, launderers, and cooks.” Gerard De Groot adds, “women assisted the male fighting forces in areas like transportation, communication and administration.” The range of involvement by a woman could include both combatant and non-combatant roles. While the majority of the tasks that women undertook centered on the realm of the non-combatant, those that surrounded the limited number that took part in acts of violence were more frequently noticed. The reality was that “rural women in maquis [rural areas] support networks” contained the overwhelming majority of those who participated. This is not to marginalize those women who did engage in acts of violence, but simply to illustrate that they constituted in the minority.\n\nDespite the fact that destruction of civilian and military targets by women through paramilitary activities included less than seventy women, or about 2% of the total females in the military arm of the FLN, it was these acts, especially during the Battle of Algiers (1957), which received most of the attention given to women in this conflict.\n\nA reason for such attention was that included in the women who perpetrated direct violence against the French were Djamila Boupacha and Djamila Bouhired, combatants in the Battle of Algiers. Eventually captured, the trials of these women, specifically Bouhired, gained recognition from international audiences. Another reason is that the violent nature of such activities, especially when carried out by women, were much more sensational than feeding and nursing FLN soldiers.\n\nAs a result of mujahidat and fidayat not having many written accounts about them, oral testimonies have been the main source in understanding the significance of women's roles in the FLN-ALN and their contributions to the Algerian War. While these important pieces of testimony give a voice to women who were often \"excluded from the history and memory of the Algerian War as well as victimized in postcolonial Algeria,\" there remain many omissions in the oral accounts of women combatants.\n\nSome particularly difficult issues that are often excluded from oral testimonies relate to \"marriages in the maquis and the FLN-ALN's control of women's sexuality in the maquis.\" As noted by scholar Ryme Seferdjeli, \"In two interviews with mujahidat (Layla Ettayeb and Djamila Amrane) who married in the maquis, they categorically refused to speak about the circumstances in which they got married; nor would they make any comment on it\". Another example of why testimonies of rape and torture of the women combatants in Algeria do not come to light can be seen in the story of a mujahida named Louisette Ighilahriz. When Ighilahriz \"published her story admitting to having been tortured and raped during the Algerian War, she received little support from other mujahidat.\" This can be accounted for by the fact that revealing such violence, especially of a sexual nature, is considered a taboo and reliving such trauma can be extremely difficult for survivors of sexual violence.\n\nTherefore, few women combatants are prepared to publicly admit personal stories of the torture and rape that took place during the war. Further, by revealing accounts of sexual violence and subjugation during the war, mujahidat would be seen as victimized women rather than courageous fighters who were absolute members of the ALN. During and after the war, the FLN rhetoric was very much focused on spreading a heroic image of the mujahidat, \"in order to achieve public recognition\" and as a form of revolutionary propaganda, which may have influenced the oral testimonies of the mujahidat. In an interview with an unnamed mujahida she acknowledged that:\"It is difficult to write history. There are things we will never be able to tell. I have to admit that I would have difficulties in invoking certain points or details.\"In another interview with a mujahida named Houria, when the interviewer and historian Chérifa Bouatta, \"asked about the nature of the affective and sexual relationships\" with Houria's first husband, she immediately answered, \"No, we don't talk about that.\"\n\nIn addition to general support tasks, women possessed gender-specific abilities that allowed them to carry out clandestine tasks that would have proved difficult for men. Though women used these capabilities in both the urban and rural arenas of the war, it was the nature of the urban dimension of the war that contained the highest concentration, both in number and frequency, of covert activities by females. The best documented example of this is in the Battle of Algiers. In this battle male FLN operatives, driven underground by the French, stayed out of the public realm, avoiding detention and interrogation, while the women who helped to keep them hidden were able to move about freely and smuggle weapons and other sensitive materials as a result of their manipulation of personal appearance. The manner in which women did this was twofold; first by the religious practice of wearing the veil, which the French saw as above suspicion, or, adopting a European appearance seeming to demonstrate their adherence to French values and way of life. Women like Djamila Bouhired, due to the incapacitation of men, were also charged with carrying out terrorist attacks ordered by FLN leadership and did so by again using changes in dress to their advantage.\n\nThe desire to pull off the veil by the French manifested because the Algerian woman was a target of French male lust. To not arouse suspicion, Algerian women used western style implements like strollers and handbags to conceal explosives while sporting western attire without any veils.\n\nAn attempted bombing was carried out by Yasmine Belkacem\n\n\"Some historians argue that the leaders and male combatants generally accepted the presence of women in the maquis, seeing them as sisters in combat. Others claim that they were on the whole hostile to the presence of women in military units.\"\n\nExternally the FLN pursued policies that highlighted women in the Algerian War. \"El Moudjahid\", a publication of the FLN, sought to create the ‘myth’ of the female warrior and to idolize her as a martyr and linchpin in the war. Articles published, including contributions by women to a series ‘Diary of a Guerilla’, cast the female in a heroic light highlighting her bravery and contributions to the war effort. The writings of Frantz Fanon also lent themselves to FLN propaganda because he championed the idea that by simply participating in the war women were engaging in an act of liberation. The FLN was then able to formulate a motivation for women based on an “abstract notion of ‘freedom’” linked with strong nationalism as opposed to a goal of social progress, avoiding the need to engage in a discussion of women’s issues because they equated it to freedom from colonial rule. Publicly, the FLN identified the contributions of women, but avoided promising specific rewards as a result.\n\nInternally FLN attitudes towards women are described in a statement by an FLN commander Si Allal:\n“it is forbidden to recruit djoundiates [female soldiers] and nurses without the zone’s authorization. In independent Algeria, the Muslim woman’s freedom stops at the door of her home. Woman will never be equal to man” \n\nThere existed obstacles precluding the involvement of women, including desire by some men to not subject women to any additional danger outside of the significant risks of simply living in Algeria at this time; the dramatic change, which many FLN members were not convinced could occur, that would be required of women going from secluded home life to active participation; and a general lack of trust in women, especially their ability to keep FLN secrets if captured. Upon entry into the resistance there were additional requirements as well, an investigation of adultery that carried a penalty of death, and a possible test of her virginity. The involvement of women, especially those who were literate and had proactive tendencies, sometimes made their often-illiterate male counterparts uncomfortable. As a result of this and other factors the FLN enacted a deportation to surrounding countries of these progressive female elements, a large percentage of which were removed from Algeria by 1958.\n\nAccording to scholar Ryme Seferdjeli, \"Women have been reluctant to address the question of marriages in the maquis\". While marriages did occur during the war, whether or not marriages were ever forced has not been entirely determined. Many interviewed women combatants were evasive in regards to the topic of marriage within the maquis. Further, within \"a few wilayat the FLN strongly encouraged mujahidat to marry\" and many mujahidat \"who joined the ALN during the war ended up marrying\" the male combatants in the maquis. The ALN \"authorized or forbade marriages\" depending on the wilaya and if at the time the ALN found marriages to be problematic or beneficial.\n\nHistorian and former combatant Djamila Minne, who interviewed many former women combatants, explains that:\"Beyond those feelings of suspicion and hostility, or admiration and glorification, deep bonds of affection were established, which were the result of long periods spent together and dangers faced together. During the interviews, it struck me that out of 47 women militants who married during or after the war, 38 are married with men militants. Now, for a fighter, to get married with a women fighter is the best proof of accepting the fight she engaged in and of esteem for what she has been\". \n\nBy 1957, largely through torture of captured women, the French came to acknowledge the different roles played by female FLN members including their terrorist actions. Around this time the French initiated a campaign of ‘emancipation’ directed at Muslim women that sought to draw them away from the FLN. This included the Plan de Constantine aimed at increasing female education, Ordonnance 59-274 giving women more say in their marital status, public unveiling of female Algerians by French women, extension of the vote to women in 1957, and the symbolic installation of Muslim women in public office, among others. Unfortunately for the French this campaign, while it did have some successes, was largely ineffective.\n\nWomen in Algeria, regardless of their involvement and contributions to the conflict, nevertheless remained in their pre-war subservient position afterward as a result of the prevailing societal, religious, and cultural conditions.\n\n\n"}

It is located half a mile north of Port Stanley Airport, four miles to the northeast of the capital city of Stanley, on a peninsula connected to the mainland by the Boxer Bridge and a narrow isthmus known as \"The Neck\". Gypsy Cove is a smaller bay located on the west side of Yorke Bay. Most cruise ships pass Yorke Bay and Gypsy Cove on the way to dock in Stanley Harbour. It faces northwards into Port William, with Canopus Hill to the south, and is known internationally as a breeding site for the threatened Magellanic penguin.\n\nBecause of Yorke Bay's strategic position as one of only three bays close to both Stanley and the airport with beaches capable of supporting an expected amphibious landing on the east coast of East Falkland (the others being Surf Bay and Rookery Bay due east of Stanley), Yorke Bay beach was heavily mined with hundreds of anti-personnel and anti-tank minimum metal mines during the 1982 Argentine occupation of the Falkland Islands. The British forces eventually marched on Stanley from the landward side to the west instead, but the minefields around the airport remained and were never removed.\n\nPrior to the war, Yorke Bay was a popular summer swimming and recreation site for local residents, but the entire northern coast of the Port Stanley Airport peninsula (including Yorke Bay) have been fenced and marked as strictly off-limits since a tractor and bulldozer were destroyed by an anti-tank mine while attempting to lay a pipeline in the area in 1986.\n\nA Cranfield University assessment dismissing the feasibility of demining Yorke Bay noted that the sand dunes had expanded considerably since 1982, burying the mines too deeply for advanced detection equipment and disrupting the orderly lines in which they were originally laid. At the same time, however, any large storm could potentially cause large numbers of mines to suddenly resurface. To recover them all would thus require mass excavation of the entire beach area with armored digging equipment, a task that would be expensive, dangerous, unlikely to definitively succeed, and certain to do severe damage to the \"internationally important\" Magellanic penguin rookeries. Local residents and officials have also expressed opposition to the idea: Falklands Governor Howard Pearce stated that the high probability that \"only 95 percent\" of the mines would end up being accounted for would actually \"bring a sense of complacency to the community and increase rather than reduce the chance of injury.\" As such, the bay is likely to remain permanently impassable for humans; on the positive side, the penguins have benefited from their undisturbed control of the beaches (being too small and too light to set off the mines), resulting in an unplanned, man-made wildlife refuge where tourists can view the penguins safely from a distance without disrupting their habitat.\n\n"}
