More recent editions contain an afterword by Malise Ruthven bringing the history up to the present day including the Invasion of Iraq.\n\nHourani follows the methodology employed by Ibn Khaldun in his \"Muqaddimah\", specifically the reliance on the concept of \"asabiyyah\" as a means of accounting for dynastic and political changes. Thus, the book involves a considerable amount of social history as well as economic history in order to account for the rise and subsequent fall of historical powers such as the Umayyad and Ottoman Empires.\n\nHourani's specialisation was in intellectual history, and this is also a focus of this work. Considerable rigour is given to explanations of the rise of Arab nationalism, Salafism, Ba'athism and Islamism.\n\nThe book has been translated into Arabic, and the book has found some currency in Arab universities and schools as an introductory text for Arab history. It has also been used as a text for upper-level courses in Arabic as a second language, on account of the highly readable style of Kamal Khouly's translation.\n\n"}

The Persian daric was the first gold coin which, along with a similar silver coin, the siglos, (From Ancient Greek σίγλος, Hebrew שֶׁקֶל (shékel)) represented the bimetallic monetary standard of the Achaemenid Persian Empire which has continued till today. It seems that before then, a continuation of Lydian coinage under Persian rule was highly likely. Achaemenid coinage includes the official imperial issues (Darics and Sigloi), as well as coins issued by the Achaemenid governors (Satraps), such as those stationed in ancient Asia Minor.\n\nWhen Cyrus the Great (550–530 BC) came to power, coinage was unfamiliar in his realm. Barter and to some extent silver bullion was used instead for trade. The practice of using silver bars for currency also seems to have been current in Central Asia from the 6th century.\n\nCyrus the Great introduced coins to the Persian Empire after 546 BC, following his conquest of Lydia and the defeat of its king Croesus, who had put in place the first coinage in history. With his conquest of Lydia, Cyrus acquired a region in which coinage was invented, developped through advanced metallurgy, and had already been in circulation for about 50 years, making the Lydian Kingdom one of the leading trade powers of the time. \n\nIt seems Cyrus initially adopted the Lydian coinage as such, and continued to strike Lydia's lion-and-bull coinage. The stater coins had a weight of 10.7 grams, a standard initially created by Croesus, which was then adopted by the Persians and became commonly known as the \"Persic standard\". The Persians also minted postumous Croeseid half-staters, with a weight of 5.35g, which would become the weight standard for the later Sigloi, introduced at the end of the 6th century BCE.\n\nSoon after 546, Cyrus also had full control of Asia Minor, including other kingdoms such Lycia, Caria or Ionia, following the conquests of his general Harpagus. With the conquest of Lydia and the adoption of Lydian coinage, the nascent Achaemenid Empire thus obtained access to the most modern coinage of its time and the economic power that goes with it. The mint was located in Sardis, now capital of all the Western Satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire, and continued minted operation under Cyrus. This coinage would supply the western part of the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nTechnically, these early coins used incuse punches on the reverse, while the obverse die would consist in some pictorial design (\"die and punch\" technique, rather than the later \"two dies\" technique). The Lydian coins used double punches on the reserve, a technique which would be simplified in the time of Darius by using a single reverse punch on some coinage. Some of the earliest Lycian coins under the Achaemenids also used an animal design on the obverse and incuse punches on the reverse, which developed into geometrical forms, such as two diagonals between projecting rectangular lugs. \n\nAs late as the time of the foundation of the Apadana Palace in Persepolis, circa 515 BCE, it seems that the Achaemenid had not yet designed the Sigloi and Darics. This is known because no Darics or Sigloi were found in the Apadana hoard, under the Apadana foundation stones of the Apadana Palace in Persepolis (dated to between 519 and 510 BC), whereas the hoard contained several gold Croeseids of the light type from Sardis (probably minted under the rule of Darius I) and several imported Archaic Greek silver staters.\n\nThe coinage of the Achaemenid Empire started to move away from simply copying Lydian coinage to introducing changes with the reign of Darius I (ruled 522-486 BC). Under Darius I, the minting of Croeseids in Sardis was progressively replaced by the minting of Darics and Sigloi. From around 510-500 BC, Darius simplified the coining procedure by replacing the double reverse punch of Lydian coins, by a single, oblong reverse punch, and he introduced the image of the Persian king in place of the lion and bull design. This is known because no Darics or Sigloi were found in the Apadana hoard, under the Apadana foundation stones of the Apadana Palace in Persepolis (dated to between 519 and 510 BC), whereas there were gold Croeseids of the light type and Greek silver staters. However, a clay tablet, issued in year 22 of the reign of Darius I (circa 500 BCE), contained the impression on clay of two Type II Sigloi (\"King shooting arrow\"), showing that the new Sigloi had already been issued by 500 BCE. Because of these and other discoveries, the creation of the Darics and Sigloi is dated to the last decade of the 6th century BC, during the reign of Darius I. \n\nThe new Achaemenid coins were initially only made in silver, and the Lydian gold design of Croesus was maintained. Then, Darius introduced his new design for gold coins as well, which came to be known as Darics, from Old Persian \"Daruiyaka\", meaning \"Golden\". Although the Achaemenids had developed their own currency, they still accepted local monetary production including civic issues, throughout the land under their control, in particular in Western Asia.\n\n\nAlthough the Achaemenids fully exploited and developed coinage production from Western Asia, it seems the barter economy remained quite important in the Iranian heartland throughout the Achaemenid period, and the Achaemenids did not develop their own mints in Iran: minting coinage in Iran would only start later from circa 330 BCE under Alexander the Great and the Seleucid Empire. The circulation of the Daric was mainly confined to the Western part of the Achaemenid Empire. \n\nIt seems that all the minting activity for the Darics and the Sigloi for the whole Empire was essentially centralized in one mint, or possibly two mints at Sardis in Lycia. Sardis remained the central mint for the Persian Darics and Sigloi of Achaemenid coinage, and there is no evidence of other mints for the new Achaemenid coins during the whole time of the Achaemenid Empire. According to hoard finds, Sardis was clearly the main mint, but there may also have been secondary mints in southwestern and northwestern Asia Minor. \n\nOverall, it seems that the minting of Darics and Sigloi was rather small in quantity compared to the other local productions of coins in Asia Minor, or the circulation of Greek coins in the area. Although the gold Daric became an international currency which was found throughout the Ancient world, the circulation of the silver Sigloi remained very much limited to Asia Minor: important hoards of Sigloi are only found in these areas, and finds of Sigloi beyond are always very limited and marginal compared to Greek coins, even in Achaemenid territories.\n\nAccording to numismat Martin Price, there is no doubt that the Darics and Sigloi of Types I and II were minted at Sardis and immediately followed the production of the Croeseids, since they adopted similar weights and were of the same fabric. He insists that the finds of the Croeseids and the \"Archer\" types of Darics and Sigloi indicate that they were not an Imperial coinage, but rather the coinage of the Satrapy of Lydia.\n\n\nDarius introduced the reformed currency system from about 510-500 BC, consisting of gold Darics and silver Sigloi. The rate of exchange was 1 Daric = 20 Siglos. A Daric was between 8.10-8.50 grams in weight, based on the Babylonian shekel of 8.33 grams, slightly heavier than the Croesus standard of 8.06 grams. The purity of gold was between 98-99%. 1 Daric = 25 Attic Drachmae. It represented initially about 1 month of a soldier's wage. This new coin became popular throughout all of the ancient world for more than 150 years. Around 395 BCE, the Achaemenids, led by Satrap Pharnabazes, bribed Greek states by paying them tens of thousands of Darics in order to attack Sparta, which was then waging a campaign of destruction in Asia Minor under Agesilaus. This started the Corinthian War. According to Plutarch, Agesilaus, the Spartan king, said upon leaving Asia \"I have been driven out by 10,000 Persian archers\", a reference to \"Archers\" (\"Toxotai\") the Greek nickname for the Darics from their obverse design, because that much money had been paid to politicians in Athens and Thebes in order to start a war against Sparta. \n\nThe Siglos was 5.40-5.60 grams each, based on the 0.5 Lydian Siglos of 10.73-10.92 grams for the full unit. Purity was at first issue 97-98% but by the middle 4th century was 94-95%. 1 Siglos = 7.5 Attic Obols.\n\nAlthough the area of Babylon had never minted Darics or Sigloi, after the capture of Babylon by Alexander, the Satrap Mazaeus, reconfirmed by Alexander in his position for having opened the doors of Babylon to his armies after the Battle of Gaugamela, issued the double Daric of 16.65 grams in weight whose image was based on the Daric coin and bore his name until his death in 328 BCE. \n\n\nThe \"archer\" type used in Achaemenid coinage may have been derived from similar and contemporary images on Greek coinage, in particular those of Herakles shooting arrows. The adaptation of this design for the illustration of the Achaemenid king or hero on the obverse may have been meant as a way to glorify the king, in way a which was easily understandable to the Hellenized people in the Western areas of the Achaemenid Empire, who minted the Achaemenid coinage and to whom this coinage was mainly destined as a currency. Other depictions of the king as an archer (for example shooting from his charriot) are also known from Sumerian art, so this representation would also have been natural to subjects in the Achaemenid realm as well. The \"archer\" type of Type II, less hieratic and rigid than the traditional Achaemenid illustration of the bust of the king on Type I, may represent the fusion of the Eastern conception of the King as a royal hunter, and the Western conception of the King as a hero, and designed to represent the Achaemenid king as an Olympian contestant in a propaganda effort towards the West. These depictions also imply that the Achaemenids were the first ever to illustrate the person of their king on coinage.\n\n\nIn effect, the gold Daric became a currency desired in all the ancient world, since it was the most convenient format to exchange and accumulate wealth. The Greeks never minted much gold, but their silver Athenian tetradrachms also became a sort of world currency from the 5th century BC. The first important competition against the prestigious Daric, as a means of storing wealth and making large payments on an international scale, came later from Philip II of Macedon (ruled 359–336 BC), when he issued his own gold coinage, pointedly called \"Dareikos Philippeios\" by the Greeks.\n\nDaric coins have been found in Asia Minor, Greece, Macedonia and Italy. The Siglos denomination have been found in hoards only in Asia Minor, and single coins with other Greek coinage from Ancient Egypt to Afghanistan (Kabul hoard) and Pakistan (Shaikhan Dehri hoard).\n\nIn all the known hoards of the Achaemenid period, royal Achaemenid coinage, such as the sigloi, form actually a small minority, while most of the non-local coinage generally comes from the Greek realm, either from the independent Greek mainland or from the Greek colonies of Western Asia under the Achaemenid rule. For example the Kabul hoard, in modern day Afghanistan, included 30 coins from various Greek cities, about 33 Athenian coins and an Iranian imitation of an Athenian coin, only 9 royal Achaemenid silver coins (sigloi). There were also 29 locally minted coins and 14 punch-marked coins in the shape of bent bars. \n\nSome Achaemenid Satraps are also known to have minted coins in imitation of Athenian coinage, such as the Achaemenid Satrap of Egypt Sabakes (ruled circa 340-333 BCE). An Achaemenid copy of an Athenian coin, this time found in the Kabul hoard was minted in the vicinity of Babylon circa 380 BCE. \n\nThe fact that Greek coins (both Archaic and early Classical) are comparatively numerous in Achaemenid period coin hoards, much more numerous than sigloi, suggests that the circulation of Greek coinage was central in the monetary system of the Empire. These coins were probably not legal tenders in the Achaemenid Empire, but were valued for their weight in silver, and thus used as bullion silver. Numerous finds of hacksilber hoards in the East also exist from the period, in which various silver objects, including coins, are cut into pieces, in order to facilitate their exchange on the basis of their weight.\n\nGreek coinage travelled throughout the Achaemenid Empire. For example, the Greek coins discovered in the Kabul hoard include the following types:\nThe Achaemenid Empire already reached the doors of India during the original expansion of Cyrus the Great, and the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley is dated to circa 515 BC under Darius I. An Achaemenid administration was established in the area. The Kabul hoard, also called the Chaman Hazouri hoard, is a coin hoard discovered in the vicinity of Kabul, Afghanistan, containing numerous Achaemenid coins as well as many Greek coins from the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. The deposit of the hoard is dated to the Achaemenid period, in approximately 380 BCE. The hoard also contained many locally produced silver coins, minted by local authorities under Achaemenid rule. Several of these issues follow the \"western designs\" of the facing bull heads, a stag, or Persian column capitals on the obverse, and incuse punch on the reverse.\n\nAccording to numismatist Joe Cribb, these finds suggest that the idea of coinage and the use of punch-marked techniques was introduced to India from the Achaemenid Empire during the 4th century BCE. More Achaemenid coins were also found in Pushkalavati and in Bhir Mound.\n\nDuring the 4th century, following the weakening of central Achaemenid power, and the development of coinage technologies, Siglos production receded and numerous satrapal issues of a very high quality started to appear in Western Asia under the Achaemenid Empire. These issues combined Achaemenid as well as Greek characteristics. Throughout, coin circulation was characterized by a mix of coins from the Achaemenid and Greek realms.\n\nVarious Achaemenid satraps also issued imitations of Athenian tetradrachms, such as Sabakes in Egypt.\n\nAlthough many of the first coins of Antiquity were illustrated with the images of various gods or symbols, the first ever portraiture of actual rulers appears with these Achaemenid satrapal issues in the 5th century BC, in particular with the coinage of Lycia. The Achaemenids had been the first to illustrate the person of their king or a hero in a stereotypical manner, showing a bust or the full body, but never an actual portrait, on their Sigloi and Daric coinage from circa 500 BC. Before the Lycian coins with dynastic portraits, a slightly earlier candidate for the first portrait is Themistocles, the Athenian general who became a Governor of Magnesia on the Meander for the Achaemenid Empire circa 465-459 BC, although there is some doubt that his coins may have represented Zeus rather than himself. Themistocles may have been in a unique position in which he could transfer the notion of individual portraiture, already currrent in the Greek world, and at the same time wield the dynastic power of an Achaemenid dynast who could issue his own coins and illustrate them as he wished. From the time of Alexander the Great, portraiture of the issuing ruler would then become a standard, generalized, feature of coinage.\n\nAfter his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire, Alexander the Great established his own satraps in the conquered territories, some of them Achaemenids who had been favorable to the invader, such as Mazaios, others some of Alexander's closest supports, such as Balacrus. Several satraps continued to use an Achaemenid type for their coinage, such as Balacrus when he became Hellenistic satrap of Cilicia, complete with the local deety of Tarsus, Baal. This coinage is said to have later influenced Alexander's imperial coinage, which was often minted in the same mints.\n\n\n\n"}

He was an authority on Central Asian and South Asian archaeology and history. He introduced archaeology as a discipline in higher education in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Throughout his career, Dani held various academic positions and international fellowships, apart from conducting archaeological excavations and research. He is particularly known for archaeological work on pre-Indus Civilization and Gandhara sites in Northern Pakistan. He was also the recipient of various civil awards in Pakistan and abroad. He was able to speak 35 local and international languages and dialects.\n\nDani was born on 20 June 1920 in Basna, Central Provinces, India, descending \"from a family of Kashmiri traders carrying the lineage name Wain.\" He graduated in 1944, with an MA degree, to become the first Muslim graduate of Banaras Hindu University. He scored highest marks in the exams which earned him a Gold Medal. This also qualified him for a teaching fellowship from the same university. Although he was provided with the grant, he was not allowed to teach due to his religious beliefs. He stayed there for six months. In 1945, he started working as a trainee in archaeology under the guidance of Mortimer Wheeler. At this time, he participated in excavations at Taxila and Mohenjo-daro. He was subsequently posted at the Department of Archaeology of British India at Taj Mahal, Agra. He received his PhD from the Institute of Archaeology, University College London.\n\nAfter the Partition of India, Dani migrated to East Pakistan. There, in 1947–49 he worked as Assistant Superintendent of the Department of Archaeology. At this time, he renovated the Verandra Museum at Rajshahi. In 1949, he married Safiya Sultana. Together, they had three sons (Anis, Navaid and Junaid) and a daughter (Fauzia). In 1950, Dani was promoted to the position of Superintendent-in-Charge of Archaeology. In the same year, he became General Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Pakistan in Dhaka. Later on, in 1955, he took the position of President of the National Committee for Museums in Pakistan. For a period of twelve years (1950–62), Dani remained Associate Professor of History at the University of Dhaka while at the same time working as curator at the Dhaka Museum. During this period, he carried out archaeological research on the Muslim history of Bengal.\n\nDani moved to the University of Peshawar in 1962 as Professor of Archaeology and remained there until 1971. During this time, he led the resetting and renovation works for the Lahore and Peshawar Museums. He became Chairman of the Research Society at the University of Peshawar in 1970. In 1971, he moved to the University of Islamabad to become Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences. He left the post in 1975 to concentrate on research as Professor of History. Meanwhile, the university was renamed Quaid-e-Azam University in 1976. He continued to work in various positions until his retirement in 1980 when he was made Emeritus Professor. During this period, he also served as President of the Archaeological and Historical Association of Pakistan (1979) and Co-Director of the Pak-German Team for Ethnology Research in Northern Areas of Pakistan (1980).\n\nHe received an Honorary Doctorate from Tajikistan University, (Dushanbe) in 1993. During the same year, Dani established the Islamabad Museum. In 1992, he was appointed Advisor on archaeology to the Ministry of Culture of Pakistan, serving from 1992–96. Between 1994–98, he remained Chairman of the National Fund for Cultural Heritage in Islamabad. In 1997, Dani became Honorary Director at the Taxila Institute of Asian Civilizations. He held the position until the time of his death.\n\nOn 22 January 2009, he was admitted to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad with heart, kidney and diabetes problems. He died on 26 January 2009 at the age of 88 years. He is buried in the H-11 Graveyard of Islamabad.\n\nDuring his Associate Professorship at Dhaka University, Dani worked as a Research Fellow at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (1958–59). Later, in 1969 he became Asian Fellow at the Australian National University, Canberra. In 1974, he went to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia as a visiting scholar. In 1977, he was Visiting Professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Over the span of his career, Dani was awarded honorary fellowships by the Royal Asiatic Society of Bangladesh (1969), the German Archaeological Institute (1981), the Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente (IsMEO) (1986), and the Royal Asiatic Society (1991).\n\nIn 1991, Dani was made an Honorary Citizen of Bukhara and an Honorary Member of the Paivand Society in Tajikistan. He was made an Honorary Life Patron of the Al-Shifa Trust, Rawalpindi, in 1993.\n\nDani remained engaged in excavation works on the pre-Indus Civilization site of Rehman Dheri in Northern Pakistan. He also made a number of discoveries of Gandhara sites in the Peshawar and Swat Valleys, and worked on Indo-Greek sites in Dir. From 1980, he was involved in research focusing on the documentation of the rock carvings and inscriptions on ancient remains from the Neolithic age up to the late Buddhist period in the high mountain region of Northern Pakistan along with Karl Jettmar, Volker Thewalt and (much later, since 1989) Harald Hauptmann of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences, University of Heidelberg.\nIn 1990–91, he led the UNESCO international scientific teams for the Desert Route Expedition of the Silk Road in China and the Steppe Route Expedition of the Silk Road in the Soviet Union.\n\nFrom his extensive fieldwork and research experience, Dani refuted any influence of South Indian culture on the Indus Valley Civilization. Using a geographic perspective of the socio-political systems and cultural distribution of the Indus Basin and surrounding hinterland, he observed that the Indo-Gangetic Plain did not play any significant role in the development of Indus Valley culture. Nor was there any invasion from the seaside during the Bronze Age, although the coastline facilitated maritime trade. The major influence, according to Dani, came from Central Asia in the west. He asserted that the hilly western borderland that appears as a boundary to the external eye is actually a network of hill plateaus where the local people have always moved freely. He therefore argued that the cultural history of Pakistan is more closely related to Central Asia through Buddhist, Persian and later Sufi influences. He strove to revive this relationship by promoting organisations such as the Pak-Central Asia Friendship Association.\n\nDani maintained that despite the Arabian Sea allowing the Meluhhans to establish trade relations with Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, the majority of historical movements occurred between Central and South Asia. The geographic location as a link between the two regions has characterised the relationship \"between the people of Pakistan and those of Central Asia in the field of culture, language, literature, food, dress, furniture and folklore\".\n\nThe first Muslim student of Banaras Hindu University, Dani scored highest in the graduation exams and received the J. K. Gold Medal from that university in 1944. Among other national awards, he received Sitara-e-Imtiaz in 1969, Aizaz-e-Kamal in 1992 and Hilal-e-Imtiaz in 2000 from the Government of Pakistan. In 2004, he was awarded the title of 'Distinguished National Professor' by the Higher Education Commission in recognition of his contributions and achievements.\n\nInternationally, his contributions to archaeology, linguistics and ancient history were commended through various prestigious honours and awards such as:\n\n\nDani had more than 30 published books and numerous journal articles to his credit. He spoke 35 languages and dialects, and was fluent in Bengali, French, Hindi, Kashmiri, Marathi, Pashto, Persian, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Saraiki, Sindhi, Tamil, Turkish, English and Urdu languages. He also published various texts in most of these languages.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He translated the \"Gesta Danorum\" by Saxo Grammaticus into Danish in 1575, and published the influential \"Hundredvisebogen\" in 1591.\n\nAnders Sørensen was born in Vejle, from which place the Vedel name comes. 14 years old he moved to study in Ribe, and after finishing his education he moved on to Copenhagen University in 1561. In 1562, he was the tutor of astronomer Tycho Brahe on Brahe's Grand Tour in Europe, forming a lasting bond of friendship with him. Vedel started studying at Wittenberg in 1565, which he finished in 1566, and was appointed priest at Copenhagen Castle in 1568. Vedel's historical knowledge was admired by leading politicians including Christoffer Valkendorf,\nBjørn Andersen, Arild Huitfeldt, Johan Friis and Peder Oxe, and he was seen as the right man to continue Christiern Pedersen's Danish language translation of the Latin chronicle \"Gesta Danorum\" by Saxo Grammaticus.\n\nHe started translation in 1570, and the finished work \"Den danske Krønicke\" was published in 1575. The work was both a translation and rewriting of the original Latin phrases. While working on the translation, he was given the income of a \"canon\" at Ribe Cathedral in 1573. After pressure from Peder Oxe, Niels Kaas, and , Vedel wrote a proposal for a Latin continuation of Saxo's work in 1578 which was finalized in 1581. He was relieved of his priesthood in Copenhagen, and moved to Ribe in 1581.\n\nHe was appointed Royal historian in 1584 and received a prelature at Ribe to support himself, and undertook the task of continuing the Danish chronicle in that year. However, he overreached himself in his attempt to do so. He planned an ambitious work in twenty-two books dealing with both language and topography as well as with history. However other tasks, lack of help from secretaries, his own slowness and carefulness—and perhaps also a general underestimation of the demands of this work—led to very modest results. In 1594, after the death of chancellor Niels Kaas, the task was given to Niels Krag, under Vedel's protestations. He got a one-year reprieve, but could not produce satisfactory results, after which he turned his work over to Niels Krag. Much of what he had written was lost at the fire of Copenhagen in 1728.\n\nOne spin-off from this task which survived was his \"Hundredvisebogen\" (1591) of a hundred Danish ballads which became a solid foundation of later knowledge of the older Danish literary tradition. It was published with the support of Queen Sophie. Vedel's one hundred songs were republished by Peder Syv in 1695, as half of his collection of 200 folksongs. Vedel's own re-creation of some of the ballads shows his ability as a poet. In the Faroe Islands, texts from \"Hundredvisebogen\" have been in use among folk singers right up until today.\n\nVedel died on 13 February 1616 in Ribe.\n\n"}

The clashes started in Linz and took place principally in the cities of Vienna, Graz, Bruck an der Mur, Judenburg, Wiener Neustadt and Steyr, but also in some other industrial cities of eastern and central Austria.\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (following the First World War), the state of Austria — largely comprising the German-speaking parts of the former empire — became constituted as a parliamentary democracy. Two major factions dominated politics in the new nation: socialists (represented politically by the Social Democratic Workers' Party) and conservatives (politically represented by the Christian Social Party). The socialists found their strongholds in the working class districts of the cities, while the conservatives could build on the support of the rural population and of most of the upper classes. The conservatives also maintained close alliances with the Roman Catholic Church, and could count among their ranks some leading clerics.\n\nAs in most of the nascent European democracies of the time, politics in Austria took on a highly ideological flavour. Both the socialist and the conservative camp did not merely consist of political parties, but possessed far-ranging power structures, including their own paramilitary forces. The conservatives began organising the \"Heimwehr\" () in 1921–23; in response, the Social Democrats organised paramilitaries called the \"Republikanischer Schutzbund\" () after 1923. Altercations and clashes between these forces (at political rallies, etc.) occurred frequently.\n\nA first major incident ensued early in 1927, when members of Hermann Hiltl's \"Frontkämpfervereinigung\" (\"Front Fighters Union\" — a paramilitary association likewise affiliated with the conservative camp) shot and killed an eight-year-old boy and a war veteran marching with the Schutzbund in a counter-demonstration in Schattendorf (Burgenland). In July, three defendants in the case were acquitted, which led to outrage in the left-wing camp. On 15 July 1927, a general strike occurred, and demonstrations took place in the capital. After the storming of a police station, security forces started shooting at demonstrators. An angry group of people then set fire to the Palace of Justice (\"Justizpalast\"), seen as a symbol of a flawed and partial judicial system. Altogether, 89 people (85 of them demonstrators) lost their lives in this July revolt, and many hundreds suffered injury. Surprisingly, the violence soon died down and the factions took their battle from the streets back into the political institutions.\n\nHowever, the travails of the First Republic only got worse in the following years. The Great Depression also showed its effects in Austria, resulting in high unemployment and massive inflation. In addition, from 1933 — the year Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany — National Socialist sympathisers (who wanted a unification of Austria with Hitler's Germany) threatened the Austrian state from within.\n\nOn 4 March 1933, Christian Social Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß suspended the Austrian Parliament. In a close vote (on railway workers' wages) in the National Council, each of the three presidents of parliament resigned their position in order to cast a ballot, leaving nobody to preside over the meeting. Even though the bylaws could have resolved this situation, Dollfuss used this opportunity to declare that parliament had ceased to function, and blocked all attempts to reconvene it. The Social Democratic Party had thus lost its major platform for political action. The conservatives, facing pressure and violence not only from the left but also from Nazis infiltrating from Germany, could now rule by decree on the basis of a 1917 emergency law, without checks on their power, and began to suspend civil liberties. They banned the Schutzbund and imprisoned many of its members.\n\nOn 12 February 1934, a force, led by Heimwehr commander in Vienna Emil Fey, searched Hotel Schiff in Linz, a property belonging to the Social Democratic Party. Linz Schutzbund commander Richard Bernaschek was the first to actively resist, sparking off armed conflict between a conglomeration of the Heimwehr, the police, the gendarmerie and the regular Federal Army against the outlawed, but still existent, socialist Schutzbund. Skirmishes between the two camps spread to other cities and towns in Austria, with the heat of the action occurring in Vienna. There, members of the Schutzbund barricaded themselves in city council housing estates (Gemeindebauten), the symbols and strongholds for the socialist movement in Austria, such as Karl-Marx-Hof. Police and paramilitaries took up positions outside these fortified complexes and the parties exchanged fire, initially only with small arms. Fighting also occurred in industrial towns such as Steyr, Sankt Pölten, Weiz, Eggenberg (Graz), Kapfenberg, Bruck an der Mur, Graz, Ebensee and Wörgl.\n\nAn apparently decisive moment in the events came with the entry of the Austrian armed forces into the conflict. Though the army remained still a comparatively independent institution, chancellor Dollfuss ordered Karl-Marx-Hof shelled with light artillery, endangering the lives of thousands of civilians and destroying many flats before forcing the socialist fighters to surrender.\nThe fighting ended in Vienna and Upper Austrian by 13 February, but continued heavily in Styrian cities, especially in Bruck an der Mur and Judenburg, until 14 or 15 February. After that, there were only small groups of socialists fighting against the armed forces, or fleeing from them. By 16 February 1934, the Austrian Civil War had ended.\n\nSeveral hundred people (including paramilitaries, members of the security forces and civilians) died in the armed conflict; more than a thousand suffered wounds. The authorities tried and executed nine Schutzbund leaders under the provisions of martial law. In addition, over 1,500 arrests were made. Leading socialist politicians, such as Otto Bauer, were forced into exile. John Gunther reported that Schutzbund members received \"mercilessly severe\" sentences.\n\nThe incidents of February 1934 were taken as a pretext by the government to prohibit the Social Democratic Party and its affiliated trade unions altogether. In May, the conservatives replaced the democratic constitution by a corporatist constitution modelled along the lines of Benito Mussolini's fascist Italy; therefore the socialists coined the term 'Austrofascism' although the underlying ideology was essentially that of the most conservative elements in the Austrian Catholic clergy, a feature inconsistent with both Italian Fascism and Nazism. The Patriotic Front (\"Vaterländische Front\"), into which the Heimwehr and the Christian Social Party were merged, became the only legal political party in the resulting authoritarian regime, the \"Ständestaat\".\n\nThough small in scale in an international comparison (and small in scale indeed in the light of the events of the Second World War which soon followed), the Austrian Civil War nevertheless proved a decisive moment in the history of the Republic. After the Second World War, when Austria re-emerged on the political landscape as a sovereign nation, politics again fell under the domination of the Social Democrats and the conservatives, who now formed a party called the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). However, so as to avoid a repeat of the bitter divisions of the First Republic, the leaders of the Second Republic were determined to put the idea of broad consensus at the heart of the new political system. The concept of the 'Grand Coalition' was introduced, in which the two major parties (Social Democrats and People's Party) shared in the government and avoided open confrontation. This system brought with it stability and continuity, but ultimately led to other political repercussions (also see \"Proporz\"). But the events of the Austrian Civil War had persuaded many in the political establishment (and, indeed, the population at large) that a slow pace of political reform was a small price to pay for social calm.\n\nAustrian political parties often stand accused of having done little to come to terms with the past. Even at the beginning of the 21st century, Austria's society bears the clear marks of division into the \"red\" (socialist) and \"black\" (conservative) areas of influence that trace back to the time of the First Republic and its civil war. This continues to cause extensive parallelisation even where ideology rarely plays a role, such as in first aid services, automotive organisations and science. \n\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "5000362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5000362", "title": "Cultural impact of Star Wars", "text": "Cultural impact of Star Wars\n\nGeorge Lucas's science fiction multi-film \"Star Wars\" saga has had a significant impact on modern popular culture. \"Star Wars\" references are deeply embedded in popular culture; references to the main characters and themes of \"Star Wars\" are casually made in many English-speaking countries with the assumption that others will understand the reference. Darth Vader has become an iconic villain, while characters such as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, C-3PO, R2-D2, and Chewbacca have all become widely recognised characters around the world. Phrases like \"evil empire\", \"May the Force be with you\", and most famously \"I am your father\" have become part of the popular lexicon. The first \"Star Wars\" film in 1977 was a cultural unifier, enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.\n\nMany efforts produced in the science fiction genre (particularly in film) can now be seen to draw heavy influence and inspiration from the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy as well as the magnitude of sequels, spin-offs, series, games and texts that it spawned. Sounds, visuals, and even the iconic score of the films have become integral components in the tapestry of American society. The film helped launch the science fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science fiction films a blockbuster genre. This very impact also made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including \"Spaceballs\", \"Family Guy\"s \"Blue Harvest\" special, Seth Green's \"\", and Lucas's self-proclaimed favorite parody, \"Hardware Wars\" by Ernie Fosselius.\n\n20th Century Fox optioned \"Star Wars\". When it unexpectedly became the decade's blockbuster, grossing $100 million in three months, Fox's stock soared from $6 to $25 per share and generated revenues of $1.2 million a day for the studio. Fox purchased the Aspen skiing and Pebble Beach golf corporations with the increased cash flow and still declared excess profits in 1977. Income from \"Star Wars\" re-releases, sequels, and merchandising enriched the studio in the following decades. \"Star Wars\" helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate.\n\n\"Star Wars\" fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before \"Star Wars\", special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s. \"Star Wars\" was also important in the movement towards the use of computer-generated imagery in films. The commercial success of \"Star Wars\" created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s. There was increased investment in special effects. Companies like Industrial Light & Magic and Digital Productions were created to provide them. The 1977 \"Star Wars\" pioneered the genre pastiche, where several classic film genres are combined in one film. In \"Star Wars\", the genres were science fiction, the Western, the war film, and the quasi-mystical epic. Along with \"Jaws\", \"Star Wars\" started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important. It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.\n\nThe holographic video effect associated with \"Star Wars\" served as a technological tool for CNN during its 2008 Election Night coverage. CNN reporter Jessica Yellin and musician will.i.am looked as though they were in the network's New York City studios talking face-to-face with hosts Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer, when in reality, they were in Chicago at Barack Obama's rally. The process involved Yellin and will.i.am standing in front of a blue screen in a special tent, while being shot by 35 HD cameras.\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" saga has had a significant impact on modern American pop culture, both the films and characters have received official parodies in numerous films and television productions, such as \"Family Guy\"s tribute-spoof season premiere episode called \"Blue Harvest\", in dedication of the saga's 30th anniversary. A sequel to the episode as a parody to \"The Empire Strikes Back\" titled \"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\" aired in the eighth season and another parody, \"It's a Trap!\", aired in the ninth season.\n\nUnofficial film parodies: \n\nOther:\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the \"Star Wars\" galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan-fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official \"Star Wars\" Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan-fiction films set in the \"Star Wars\" universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007 Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries. Lucasfilm, for the most part, has allowed but not endorsed the creation of these derivative fan-fiction works, so long as no such work attempts to make a profit from or tarnish the \"Star Wars\" franchise in any way.\n\nWhile many fan films have used elements from the licensed Expanded Universe to tell their story, they are not considered an official part of the \"Star Wars\" canon. However, the lead character from the \"Pink Five\" series was incorporated into Timothy Zahn's 2007 novel \"Allegiance\", marking the first time a fan-created \"Star Wars\" character has ever crossed into the official canon. Although since 2014, the novel became re-branded as Legends, the character has yet to reappear into the revised canon.\n\n\nThe Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum had an exhibition called \"\"Star Wars\": The Magic of Myth\". It was an exhibition of original production models, props, costumes, and characters from the first three \"Star Wars\" films. In October 2007, NASA launched a space shuttle carrying an original lightsaber into orbit. The prop handle had been used as Luke Skywalker's lightsaber in \"Return of the Jedi\". After spending two weeks in orbit, it was brought back to Earth on November 7, 2007, to be returned to its owner George Lucas.\n\nThe first successfully launched space-rocket, to be sent by the private spaceflight company SpaceX, was named the Falcon 1. Elon Musk used the word \"falcon\" within the name of the space-rocket, as a reference to the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars. The Falcon 1's success led to the fabrication of updated versions of the space rocket, in what became known as the Falcon family of space-rockets. The Falcon 1 has since been retired, in favor of the Falcon 9.\n\nCharacters and other fictional elements from \"Star Wars\" have inspired several scientific names of organisms.\n\nExamples include:\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a system of lasers and missiles meant to intercept incoming ICBMs, the plan was quickly labeled \"Star Wars\", implying that it was science fiction and linking it to Reagan's acting career. According to Frances FitzGerald, Reagan was annoyed by this, but Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle told colleagues that he \"thought the name was not so bad.\"; \"'Why not?' he said. 'It's a good movie. Besides, the good guys won.'\" This gained further resonance when Reagan described the Soviet Union as an \"evil empire\".\n\nIn television commercials, public interest group critics of the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative program deridingly referred to the orbital missile defense project as \"Star Wars\". Lucasfilm originally sued to try to enjoin this usage of its trademark, and lost. Explaining its decision, the court said,\n\nOn May 4, 1995 during a defence debate in the UK parliament, MP Harry Cohen related the Star Wars Day joke: \"May the 4th be with you\". \"Star Wars\" also made its mark in the 2001 census, when over 390,000 UK respondents entered their religion as Jedi.\n\nOn March 1, 2013, President Barack Obama spoke on the sequestration debate. He said that some people expect him to do a \"Jedi mind meld\" on the Republicans who refuse to deal.\n\nIn the 2014 Ukrainian presidential elections the Internet Party of Ukraine tried to nominate a man named Darth Vader; but his registration was refused because his real identity could not be verified. A man named Darth Vader was a candidate at the 25 May 2014 Kiev mayoral election and the Odessa mayoral election of the same day for the same party. In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election the Internet Party let Darth Vader along other \"Star Wars\" characters such as Chewbacca, Padmé Amidala, and Yoda run for seats in the Ukrainian parliament. In the election the party failed to clear the 5% election threshold (it got 0.36% of the votes) and also did not win a constituency seat and thus no parliamentary seats.\n\nIn 2015, as a part of the decommunization process in Ukraine, a statue of a Vladimir Lenin was modified into a monument to Darth Vader at the territory of Pressmash plant in Odessa.\n\nThere is a real religion based on \"Star Wars\". Their followers follow a modified version of the Jedi Code, and they believe in the concept of \"The Force\" as an energy field of all living things, which \"surrounds us... penetrates us\" and \"binds the galaxy together\", as is depicted within \"Star Wars\" movies, although without the fictional elements such as telekinesis. Many citizens around the world answer list their religion as Jedi during their countries respective Census, among them Australia and New Zealand getting high percentages. A petition in Turkey to build a Jedi Temple within a University, also got international media attention.\n\n\"Star Wars\" has been the subject of several parodies in the humorous magazine \"Mad\", a publication which frequently publishes cartoon spoofs of Hollywood films. A parody called \"Star Roars\" was published in January 1978 featuring the magazine's mascot, Alfred E. Neuman wearing a Darth Vader helmet. In December of that year, a second \"Star Wars\" parody appeared in the form of a Broadway musical, \"The Force and I — the Mad Star Wars Musical\".\n\nBetween 2002 and 2004, museums in Japan, Singapore, Scotland and England showcased the \"Art of Star Wars\", an exhibit describing the process of making the \"Star Wars\" trilogy.\n\nIn 2013, \"Star Wars\" became the first major motion picture translated into the Navajo language.\n\nIn the \"Honorverse\" novel \"The Shadow of Saganami\", Talbot Sector Governor Estelle Matsuko, Baroness Medusa, states that she does not want the Manticoran Marines to start looking like Imperial stormtroopers to the local systems.\n\nIn the CW TV series \"Legends of Tomorrow\"- looking at various heroes from DC Comics who travel through time to protect history- the second-season episode \"Raiders of the Lost Art\" sees the titular heroes arrive in 1967, where their actions unintentionally prompt George Lucas to quit film school in fear after witnessing a battle between the Legends and the forces of their enemy, the Legion of Doom. Realising that the loss of George Lucas's films has caused team members Ray Palmer and Nate Heywood to lose their abilities, as Lucas's films were the inspiration for Ray and Nate's interests in science and history respectively. As a result, the team must convince Lucas to return to film school so that his work will inspire them in their future lives, with Lucas being convinced to return during a fight when the team are nearly killed in a garbage compactor, his decision restoring Ray and Nate's powers and allowing them to escape.\n\nSeveral organizations now teach lightsaber combat throughout the world as a competitive sport and pastime, these sports interpretations of combat from the films using 'toy' combat capable lightsabers.\n\nDarth Vader appears in the game Clash Royale as the Dark Prince troop.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38499179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38499179", "title": "De Leonism", "text": "De Leonism\n\nDe Leonism, occasionally known as Marxism–De Leonism, is a libertarian Marxist current developed by the American activist Daniel De Leon. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP). De Leon combined the rising theories of revolutionary syndicalism in his time with orthodox Marxism. According to De Leonist theory, militant industrial unions are the vehicle of class struggle. Industrial unions serving the interests of the proletariat (working class) will bring about the change needed to establish a socialist system. While sharing some characteristics of anarcho-syndicalism (the management of workplaces through unions) and with the SLP being a member of the predominantly anarcho-syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), De Leonism actually differs from it in that he and the modern SLP still believe in the necessity of a central government to coordinate production as well as in the use of a revolutionary political party in addition to union action to achieve its goals.\n\nAccording to the De Leonist theory, workers would simultaneously form socialist industrial unions in the workplaces and a socialist political party which would organize in the political realm. Upon achieving sufficient support for a victory at the polls, the political party would be voted into office, giving the De Leonist program a mandate from the people. It is assumed that at that point the socialist industrial unions will have attained sufficient strength in the workplaces for workers there to take control of the means of production.\n\nThe De Leonist victory at the polls would be accompanied by a transfer of control of the factories, mines, farms and other means of production to workers councils organized within the industrial unions. De Leonists distinguish this event from the general strike to take control of the workplaces advocated by anarcho-syndicalists and refer to it instead as a \"general lockout of the ruling class\".\n\nThe existing government would then be replaced with a government elected from within the socialist industrial unions and the newly elected socialist government would quickly enact whatever constitutional amendments or other changes in the structure of government needed to bring this about, adjourning \"sine die\". Workers on the shop floor would elect local shop floor committees needed to continue production and representatives to local and national councils representing their particular industry.\n\nWorkers would also elect representatives to a central congress, called an All-Industrial Congress, which would effectively function as the national government. These representatives would be subject to a recall vote at any time. De Leonism would thus reorganize the national government along industrial lines with representatives elected by industry, not by geographic location.\n\nDe Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. It predates Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's assuming leadership of the SLP. Leninism and its vanguard party idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's \"What Is to Be Done?\" Its adherents are generally opposed to the policies of the former Soviet Union and those of the People's Republic of China and other socialist states and do not consider them socialist, but rather state capitalist or following \"bureaucratic state despotism\". The highly decentralized and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the democratic centralism of Marxism–Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution. De Leonism's stance against reformism means that it is referred to by the label \"impossibilist\", along with the Socialist Party of Great Britain.\n\nDe Leonist political parties have also been criticized for being allegedly overly dogmatic and sectarian. Despite their rejection of Leninism and vanguardism, De Leonism also lies outside the \"democratic socialist\" and \"social democratic\" tradition. De Leon and other De Leonist writers have issued frequent polemics against democratic socialist movements, especially the Socialist Party of America; and consider them to be reformist or \"bourgeois socialist\". De Leonists have traditionally refrained from any activity or alliances viewed by them as trying to reform capitalism, though the Socialist Labor Party in De Leon's time was active during strikes and such, such as social justice movements, preferring instead to concentrate solely on the twin tasks of building support for a De Leonist political party and organizing socialist industrial unions.\n\n\n\n"}

He is widely acknowledged as the world's foremost expert in the history of worldwide Irish migration. Notably prolific, he has written at least 22 book-length, scholarly monographs, 3 jointly-authored scholarly books, 6 works of fiction and historical fiction, and 55 scholarly articles. He is a Fellow of both the Royal Society of Canada and the Royal Historical Society (UK). He is also a Molson Prize Laureate, awarded for a lifetime contribution to Canadian culture (other winners include Margaret Atwood, Marshall McLuhan, and Glenn Gould). He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1984, and in 1992 he won the prestigious Grawemeyer Award, then the richest non-fiction book prize in the world. Akenson received his B.A. from Yale University and his doctorate from Harvard University. He is Douglas Professor of History at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada and was simultaneously Beamish Research Professor at the Institute of Irish Studies, University of Liverpool (2006–10), and Senior Editor of the McGill-Queen's University Press (1982-2012).\n\nOriginally trained in economics and statistics at Yale, Akenson's mentor in the study of Irish History was John V. Kelleher, the founder of the Department of Celtic Languages and Literature at Harvard. All together, Akenson has written twenty-four books on the subject of Ireland. Akenson's early works in Irish history focused on the religious history of Ireland, particularly the often ignored history of the Church of Ireland, and on the history of Irish education, with an emphasis on how educational practices either tended to heal or to further engender sectarian strife. Brian Titley wrote of Akenson's efforts in the chronicling of Irish education that \"until it attracted the attention of D.H. Akenson, the writing of Irish educational history was moribund, amateurish and narrow in both scope and sympathy.\"\n\nAkenson then moved more exclusively to the study of the Irish diaspora, and now, having written well over a dozen books on Irish history and Irish migration, is considered \"the most distinguished scholar of the history of the Irish diaspora.\" He became known to many Irish-American scholars in 1984 and 1985 when in his \"The Irish In Ontario\" (1984) and \"Being Had: Historians, Evidence, and the Irish in North America\" (1985) he controversially called for (1) historians of Irish immigration in North America to make use of the better-documented Canadian data on Irish immigration and (2) historians to recognize that the long practice of ignoring Irish Protestant migration, particularly in the nineteenth century, was at best a foolish mistake and at worst a case of scholarly bigotry. Having called into question many, if not all, of the most-dearly clung to assumptions of traditional scholars of Irish immigration in America, an all-out scholarly war ensued, and Akenson was persuaded to make his case once again in 1996 with \"The Irish Diaspora: A Primer\". In this latter work, and indeed as in all of his books, Akenson pulls no punches.\n\nSince the publication of \"Being Had\" in 1985, he has remained one of the most respected but controversial scholars of Irish migration. In 1990 the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada named \"The Irish in Ontario\" (1984) \"one of the most important publications in social science in the past 50 years in Canada,\" and in 1994 he was named the winner of the Trillium Book Award for his biography of Irish writer and politician, Conor Cruise O'Brien, \"Conor: The Biography of Conor Cruise O'Brien\" (1994). Of his latest contribution to the history of Irish Migration, \"Ireland, Sweden and the Great European Migration, 1815–1914\" (2013), fellow Irish Diaspora historian Donald MacRaild wrote: \"This monumental study clearly will have a huge impact in the field. Typically of Akenson, an original thinker of the first order, it debunks many myths, half-truths, and lazy assumptions on the part of historians. However, this isn't simply a book which debunks. It isn't a tract or a treatise. Its central contribution is in offering one of the best (perhaps the very best) comparative history of European emigration.\"\n\nWhile mostly noted as a scholar of Irish migration, Akenson is also an award-winning scholar of religious history. His book \"God’s Peoples: Covenant and Land in South Africa, Israel, and Ulster\" was named the winner of the 1992 Grawemeyer Award for \"ideas improving world order.\" At the time, the Grawemeyer Award was the richest non-fiction book prize in the world. Other notable winners include Mikhail Gorbachev and Aaron T. Beck (considered the father of cognitive therapy). \"Library Journal\" named \"God’s Peoples\" one of the best 30 books published in the US in all genres in 1992. His other works on religious history have also been highly praised. \"Some Family: The Mormons and How Humanity Keeps Track of Itself\" (2007) was a finalist for the British Columbia Achievement Prize for Best Canadian Non-fiction Book; \"Saint Saul: A Skeleton Key to the Historical Jesus\" (2000) was short-listed for the Canadian Writers’ Trust Prize; and \"Surpassing Wonder: The Invention of the Bible and the Talmuds\" (1998) was shortlisted for the Governor General's Awards for Non-fiction. A Senior Editor at McGill-Queen's University Press for thirty years, Akenson remains the editor of McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion, series two, which includes more than seventy books by eminent scholars such as Jacob Neusner.\n\nIn addition to teaching and research, Akenson was senior editor of McGill-Queen's University Press from 1982 to 2012. He was editor or founding editor of two long-running series of histories published by McGill-Queen's University Press: (1) the McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion, series two (dedicated to the memory of George A. Rawlyk); (2) McGill-Queen's Studies in Ethnic History; and independently (3) Canadian Papers in Rural History. He remains the editor of the McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion series.\n\n\nAcademic Degrees (honorary):\n\n\n\n"}

He served in 1919 for six days as President of the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic, and was imprisoned for five years for his actions. He wrote several plays and poetry during that period, which gained him international renown. They were performed in London and New York as well as Berlin. In 2000, several of his plays were published in an English translation.\n\nIn 1933 Toller was exiled from Germany after the Nazis came to power. He did a lecture tour in 1936-1937 in the United States and Canada, settling in California for a while before going to New York. He joined other exiles there. Struggling financially and depressed at learning his brother and sister had been sent to a concentration camp in Germany, he committed suicide in May 1939.\n\nToller was born in 1893 into a Jewish family in Samotschin (Szamocin), Province of Posen, Prussia (now Poznań, Poland). He was the son of Ida (Kohn) and Max Toller, a pharmacist. His parents ran a general store. He had a sister and brother. They grew up speaking Yiddish and German, and he later became fluent in English. The most recent biography on Toller is Robert Ellis' Ernst Toller and German Society. Intellectuals as Leaders and Critics published by Fairleigh Dickinson University Press.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I, he volunteered for military duty. After serving for 13 months on the Western Front, he suffered a complete physical and psychological collapse. His first drama, \"Transformation\" (\"Die Wandlung\", 1919), was wrought from his wartime experiences.\nTogether with leading anarchists, such as B. Traven and Gustav Landauer, and communists, Toller was involved in the short-lived 1919 Bavarian Soviet Republic. He served as President from April 6 to April 12. His government did little to restore order in Munich. His government members were not always well-chosen. For instance, the Foreign Affairs Deputy Dr. (who had been admitted several times to psychiatric hospitals) informed Vladimir Lenin via cable that the ousted former Minister President, Johannes Hoffmann, had fled to Bamberg and taken the key to the ministry toilet with him. On Palm Sunday, April 1919, the Communist Party seized power, with Eugen Leviné as their leader. Shortly after that, the republic was defeated by right-wing forces.\n\nThe noted authors Max Weber and Thomas Mann testified on Toller's behalf when he was tried for his part in the revolution. He was sentenced to five years in prison and served his sentence in the prisons of Stadelheim, Neuburg, Eichstätt. From February 1920 until his release, he was in the fortress of Niederschönenfeld, where he spent 149 days in solitary confinement and 24 days on hunger strike.\n\nHis time in prison was productive; he completed work on \"Transformation\", which premiered in Berlin under the direction of Karlheinz Martin in September 1919. At the time of this work's 100th performance, the Bavarian government offered Toller a pardon. He refused it out of solidarity with other political prisoners. Toller continued writing in prison, completing some of what would be his most celebrated works, including the dramas \"Masses Man\" (\"Masse Mensch\"), \"The Machine Breakers\" (\"Die Maschinenstürmer\"), \"Hinkemann, the German\" (\"Der deutsche Hinkemann\"), and many poems. These works established him as an important German expressionist playwright, and they used symbols derived from the First World War and its aftermath in his society.\n\nNot until after his release from prison in July 1925 was Toller able to see any of his plays performed. In 1925, the most famous of his later dramas, \"Hoppla, We're Alive!\" (\"Hoppla, wir Leben!\"), directed by Erwin Piscator, premiered in Berlin. It tells of a revolutionary discharged from a mental hospital after eight years, who discovers that his former comrades have grown complacent and compromised within the system they once opposed. In despair, he kills himself. The most recent study of Toller and his tragic life is Robert Ellis's \"Ernst Toller and German Society. Intellectuals as Leaders and Critics\" published by Fairleigh Dickinson University Press.\n\nIn 1933, after the Nazi rise to power, Toller was exiled from Germany because of his work; the Nazis did not like modernist arts of any form. His citizenship was nullified by the Nazi government later that year. He traveled to London with 16 year old Christiane Grautoff; they married in London in 1935, the same year he participated as co-director in the Manchester production of his play \"Rake Out the Fires\" (\"Feuer aus den Kesseln\").\n\nIn 1936 and 1937, Toller went on a lecture tour of the United States and Canada, settling in California. Fluent in English, he wrote screenplays but could not get them produced. In 1936 he moved to New York City, where he joined a group of artists and writers in exile, including Klaus Mann, Erika Mann (at one time married to the poet W.H. Auden, who was also in the US), and Therese Giehse. He earned some money from journalism.\n\nTwo of his early plays were produced in New York in this period: \"The Machine Wreckers\" (1922), whose opening night in 1937 he attended, and \"No More Peace\", produced in 1937 by the Federal Theatre Project and presented in New York City in 1938. Their sense of immediacy was gone: the first play was related to the First World War and its aftermath, and the second an earlier period of the rise of the Nazis. Their style was outmoded for New York, and the poor reception added to Toller's discouragement.\n\nSuffering from deep depression after learning that his sister and brother had been arrested and sent to concentration camps, and struggling with financial woes (he had given all his money to Spanish Civil War refugees), Toller committed suicide on May 22, 1939. He hanged himself in his room at the Mayflower Hotel, after laying out on his hotel desk \"photos of Spanish children who had been killed by fascist bombs.\"\n\nW. H. Auden's poem \"In Memory of Ernst Toller\" was published in \"Another Time\" (1940).\n\nThe English author Robert Payne, who knew Toller in Spain and in Paris, later wrote in his diary that Toller had said shortly before his death: \n\"If ever you read that I committed suicide, I beg you not to believe it.\" Payne continued: \"He hanged himself with the silk cord of his nightgown in a hotel in New York two years ago. This is what the newspapers said at the time, but I continue to believe that he was murdered.\" \n\n\nAfter exile:\n\nIn 2000, Alan Pearlman published his translation into English of several of Toller's plays. The literary rights to the works of Ernst Toller were the property of the novelist Katharine Weber until the copyright expired on December 31, 2009. His works have now entered the public domain.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26008491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26008491", "title": "Gary Schiff", "text": "Gary Schiff\n\nGary Schiff (born February 3, 1972, as Gary J. Schiffhauer) is an American politician and activist who represented Ward 9 on the Minneapolis City Council. A member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), he was first elected in 2001 and re-elected in 2005 and 2009. Prior to his political career, Schiff was involved with a variety of activist groups and causes ranging from human rights with the Human Rights Campaign, to historic preservation with Save Our Shubert.\n\nDuring his city council tenure, Schiff worked to ease ordinances prohibitive to small businesses, especially microbreweries, and strongly advocated against a publicly funded stadium for the Minnesota Vikings. In January 2013, Schiff began a campaign for mayor of Minneapolis in the 2013 election but after an unsuccessful DFL endorsement convention, dropped out of the race and backed an opponent (the eventual winner) in mid-June. His third and final term on the City Council ended in January 2014.\n\nSchiff took over as president of the Council on Crime and Justice the following July. A federal audit identified misused grant funds under Schiff's leadership. The organization closed abruptly following his termination. In January 2017, he announced his candidacy for Minneapolis's 9th Ward City Council seat in the 2017 municipal elections.\n\nSchiff was born Gary J. Schiffhauer on February 3, 1972, and grew up the youngest of six children in Western New York State. In 1990, the American Civil Liberties Union represented Schiff after he graduated from Lewiston-Porter High School in his hometown of Youngstown, New York. According to \"The Buffalo News\", Schiff had painted a mural along the school's stairwell that referenced \"drugs, safe sex, AIDS and racism\" in the style of artist Keith Haring. In September of that year, the school's superintendent, Walter S. Polka, decided that parts of the mural's text were objectionable. The American Civil Liberties Union became involved in an extended legal fight over the constitutionality of Polka's censorship, and a New York Supreme Court Justice sided with the Lewiston-Porter School Board. In 1991, the school board voted 5-1 to paint over the mural. The board cited Schiff's involvement in a recent ACT-UP demonstration at the school—where demonstrators gave condoms and safe sex literature to students—as a major influence on their decision.\n\nAs part of a transition that included moving from Youngstown to Minneapolis to attend college at the University of Minnesota, Schiff shortened his name from the original Schiffhauer as a result of his parents' shame and refusal to acknowledge his sexuality in the small conservative town of Youngstown NY where the family attended church in a conservative Roman Catholic Parish (St. Bernard's, Youngstown, NY). However, Robert and Rita Schiffhauer, Gary's parents, soon joined the PFLAG Chapter in nearby Buffalo, NY in order to understand and support their son which they continued to do throughout their lives. Schiff's official public statement is that he shortened his name in an effort to move athe memories of bullying that he said made his youth \"an act of survival\". In October 1992, he and six other students protested against the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and its compliance with a longstanding ban on homosexuals in the military. The seven protesters interrupted a meeting of the University Board of Regents, demanded the expulsion of the ROTC from campus, and handcuffed themselves to the Regents' chairs. Wearing signs that read \"$old,\" suggesting that their human rights had been traded for Federal grant money, Schiff and the six other students were arrested by University Police and each charged with misdemeanors.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1995, Schiff directed the Progressive Student Leadership Exchange (PLSE), a program modeled on the Civil Rights Movement's Freedom Summer. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) took interest in the program, and invited Schiff to direct it as the newly named \"Youth College for Campaign Training\" in Washington, D.C. The HRC-funded program invited people aged 18–24 to participate in workshops, and sent the participants to \"target states\" where they worked in groups as campaign staff members. The program was still in operation as late as 2006.\n\nAfter graduating in 1994 with a B.A. in women's studies, Schiff moved to Washington, D.C. to work with the Human Rights Campaign. He returned to Minneapolis to work with Progressive Minnesota, \"a grassroots group focused on community organizing and electoral politics.\" In December 1997, he became involved in a fight to save the Shubert Theater, a former vaudeville house on \"Block E\" in downtown Minneapolis, after the Minneapolis City Council approved a redevelopment plan that called for the theater's demolition. Within days, Schiff organized \"Save Our Shubert,\" a grassroots effort to preserve the theater. After eight months, during which time Save our Shubert acted as a media contact, lobbied the city council, and \"kept the Shubert in the public eye\", the Minneapolis City Council voted 9-3 to move the theater to a space adjacent to the Hennepin Center for the Arts at a cost of $3.9 million.\n\nSchiff, at the time working as a teaching assistant in the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs on his way to earning a master's degree in urban planning, took a leave of absence to run for a seat on the Minneapolis City Council against Michael Guest and Kathy Thurber in 2001. He won unanimous DFL endorsement on September 11, 2001 and, in a race that was overshadowed by the 2001 terrorist attacks, he ran against Lucky Rosenbloom, an African-American Republican. Schiff received the endorsement of the \"Star Tribune\", which noted his \"first-hand knowledge\" of light rail systems in other U.S. cities. Elected by a large majority in November 2001, Schiff became one of seven newly elected members on the 13-member city council, joining two Green Party members, two other openly gay council members, one African-American council member, and four women. He was sworn into office on December 17, 2001, earlier than his fellow councilmembers, when Thurber resigned from her seat to assume the position of deputy director of Perpich Center for Arts Education.\n\nIn his first term, Schiff sponsored and cosponsored numerous legal reforms to the Minneapolis Zoning Code that reduced bureaucratic obstacles for small businesses and housing developers, including a measure that permitted sidewalk cafes to use permanent outdoor furniture and a change in city zoning code that facilitated the construction of denser and more affordable housing. He also sponsored an ordinance to add domestic partnerships to the Zoning Code's definition of \"family\" in terms of housing.\n\nIn 2003, with colleagues Barbara Johnson and Sandy Colvin Roy, Schiff developed a last-minute plan to restore $2 million in proposed cuts to the Minneapolis Fire and Police Departments, following a $26 million cut from Local Government Aid by former Governor Tim Pawlenty. That same year, he sponsored an ordinance that effectively blocked police officers, city inspectors, and other city employees from inquiring about a resident's immigration status. The ordinance forbids police officers from arresting a suspect solely on the grounds of a suspected immigration status violation.\n\nIn July 2004, the Minneapolis City Council passed a ban on indoor smoking in bars, restaurants, pool halls, and bowling alleys by a 12-1 margin. In March 2005, the ban took effect alongside other indoor smoking bans passed by other cities in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. Subsequently, during the 2005 Minneapolis City Council elections, a write-in candidate named Dave Shegstad received 10 percent of the ninth ward vote under a \"Smoke Out Gary\" campaign slogan—a reference to Schiff's role as a co-author of the smoking ban. 59 percent of voters re-elected Schiff to a second term; his main opponent, Green Party candidate David Bicking, won 30 percent of the vote.\n\nIn 2006, Schiff sponsored eliminating a cap on taxi licenses in Minneapolis. The move angered some local taxi drivers, who noted that an attending increase in licenses would lead to greater competition in the local taxicab business. The City Council passed the cap lift, and the number of Minneapolis taxis doubled between 2010 and 2012.\n\nBeginning in 2008, Schiff and other city leaders contended with local ramifications of the 2008-2012 global recession, which included spate of foreclosures in economically distressed neighborhoods. In April 2008, the city council approved a pilot mortgage assistance program called Minneapolis Advantage. The program, which passed the council 10-2, offered forgivable loans to homebuyers who were interested in properties on the same block as foreclosed or city-owned properties within targeted neighborhoods. Schiff argued that the initiative was not targeted enough to have the designed effect and voted against it, along with fellow councilmember Paul Ostrow.\n\nThe city also strictly regulated non-motorized pedicabs; it first permitted the bicycle-powered taxis in 1984, but there were no active pedicab licenses in the city by 2008. Schiff proposed eliminating some restrictions, and the city council passed ordinances allowing pedicabs to operate on downtown streets, downtown bridges, and on the Nicollet Mall, at any time except the morning and evening rush hours. In October 2011, when the city permitted pedicabs to operate during rush hours (with new safety regulations), eight licensed pedicab companies operated forty cabs in the downtown area.\n\nIn February 2012, a reporter for the \"Minnesota Daily\" wrote that Schiff is \"possibly the most active and popular City Council member\" and noted that 60 percent of Ward 9 voters reelected him to a third term in 2009.\n\nAn avid supporter of microbrewing in Minneapolis, Schiff sponsored the \"Brew Beer Here\" ordinance that allowed the sale of 64-ounce \"growlers\" of beer on Minneapolis brewery premises. Passed in August 2010, the ordinance facilitated brewery operation within Minneapolis city limits and led to the opening of Harriet Brewing Company, the first Minneapolis brewery to open in decades. With colleague Elizabeth Gidden, Schiff co-sponsored the \"Surly Bill,\" an ordinance that permits breweries to sell pints of their products on-site. Schiff also proposed eliminating zoning constraints against establishments serving alcohol within 300 feet of a house of worship outside of the downtown area. The ordinance change was inspired by a struggle between Rob Miller, a brewer interested in opening a \"pico brewery\" called Dangerous Man Brewing in Northeast Minneapolis, and the church of Saints Cyril and Methodius Church, located across the street from the brewery's proposed location. Citing his work to ease ordinances prohibitive to the microbrewing industry, \"Twin Cities Business\" named Schiff the most business-friendly city councilor in Minneapolis in 2012.\n\nIn 1997, before he became a member of the city council, Schiff co-authored an amendment to the City of Minneapolis Charter that mandated a voter referendum on city stadium subsidies that cost taxpayers over $10 million. As of 2009, the Minnesota Vikings were moving forward on a $870 million plan to rebuild a downtown stadium on the site of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The team also considered building a new stadium in other cities, including Anoka, Minnesota and Los Angeles, California. Though supportive of the Vikings remaining in Minneapolis in 2012, Schiff became an outspoken critic of the financing plan for the stadium when it came to a vote before the Minneapolis City Council, in part because it bypassed the charter amendment. Schiff also argued that the plan's estimated cost to Minneapolis taxpayers, cited at $150 million in construction costs, failed to account for interest, maintenance costs, and upgrades over the course of the stadium's expected 30-year lifespan. In a \"Star Tribune\" editorial, Schiff quoted figures presented by the city's chief financial officer, Kevin Carpenter, which estimated a cumulative, 30-year cost that could range from $675 million to $890 million. Despite Schiff's objections, the Minneapolis City Council approved the stadium financing 7-6. Subsequently, the football team moved forward with plans to demolish the Metrodome and rebuild a new stadium on the site, and Governor Mark Dayton signed a financing plan approved by the legislature.\n\nSchiff had been considering running for mayor of Minneapolis in the 2013 Minneapolis mayoral election as early as June 2012, and stated that his ultimate decision would not be contingent upon whether mayor R.T. Rybak opted to run for another term. Speaking from the Harriet Brewing tap room on January 29, 2013, Schiff announced his official candidacy for the position. On the same day, he also held an event in the Dinkytown area near the University of Minnesota with rapper Brother Ali to kick off his campaign. Schiff was the second City Councilmember to announce his candidacy after Betsy Hodges of Ward 13, and Don Samuels of Ward 5 announced his candidacy later.\n\nThe University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs hosted the first mayoral debate on March 27, with Schiff among the five declared candidates who were seeking the DFL nomination. A week later, on April 4, Schiff took part in the city's second mayoral debate, this time located at a Kingfield-neighborhood church. During the proceedings, he pledged that he would abide by the DFL's endorsement, making him the sole candidate to vow so among the five candidates seeking the endorsement at the time. Schiff also participated in the city's first mayoral debate dealing specifically with issues concerning Minneapolis's Somali population, an event that took place on May 31 and was hosted at a Somali restaurant on Lake Street. Schiff received endorsements from the Minneapolis Firefighters Union, state representative Karen Clark, and former Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, among others.\n\nAt the DFL endorsement convention, Schiff came in third place behind Mark Andrew and Hodges during the first two rounds of voting but was denied a place on the third round ballot after failing to meet a minimum vote threshold during round two. When Schiff backed Hodges with the intention, according to the \"Star Tribune\", of preventing Andrew from receiving the 60% of votes needed to win the endorsement, he lost the support of the Minneapolis Firefighters Union. The convention concluded with no winner and, because no one was endorsed, Schiff stated that he would remain in the race. His campaign manager, Mark Warren, left Schiff's campaign shortly after the convention and a few days later, he declared an end to his bid for mayor and announced that he would campaign actively for Hodges.\n\nSchiff did not run for reelection in the City Council elections in 2013. Activist and communications specialist Alondra Cano won his seat with over 47 percent of the vote and was sworn into office on January 6, 2014. \n\nOn July 1, 2014, Schiff took over as president of the Council on Crime and Justice (CCJ), a Minneapolis nonprofit organization established in 1957 to \"create a criminal justice system that is equitable and just.\" The CCJ dismissed Schiff in 2015 and closed suddenly in 2016 after almost 60 years of operation. A federal audit conducted on a grant program that was frozen while Schiff led the CCJ identified a misuse of funds at the organization. Schiff stated that he believed that the CCJ's board of directors and its previous leadership were responsible for the council's shutdown , however, staff accounts deviate.\n\nIn January 2017, Schiff announced a bid for the Minneapolis's 9th Ward City Council seat held by Alondra Cano. Cano maintains her seat.\n\nAn avid cyclist, Schiff lives in the Corcoran neighborhood of South Minneapolis.

{"id": "14318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14318", "title": "Horned God", "text": "Horned God\n\nThe Horned God is one of the two primary deities found in Wicca and some related forms of Neopaganism. \nThe term \"Horned God\" itself predates Wicca, and is an early 20th-century syncretic term for a horned or antlered anthropomorphic god with partly pseudohistorical origins, partly based on historical horned deities.\n\nThe Horned God represents the male part of the religion's duotheistic theological system, the consort of the female Triple Goddess of the Moon or other Mother Goddess. \nIn common Wiccan belief, he is associated with nature, wilderness, sexuality, hunting, and the life cycle. Whilst depictions of the deity vary, he is always shown with either horns or antlers upon his head, often depicted as being theriocephalic (having a beast's head), in this way emphasizing \"the union of the divine and the animal\", the latter of which includes humanity.\n\nIn traditional Wicca (British Traditional Wicca), he is generally regarded as a dualistic god of twofold aspects: bright and dark, night and day, summer and winter, the Oak King and the Holly King. In this dualistic view, his two horns symbolize, in part, his dual nature. (The use of horns to symbolize duality is also reflected in the phrase \"on the horns of a dilemma.\") The three aspects of the Goddess and the two aspects of the Horned God are sometimes mapped on to the five points of the Pentagram, although which points correspond to which deity aspects varies. In some other systems, he is represented as a triune god, split into three aspects that reflect those of the Triple Goddess: the Youth (Warrior), the Father, and the Sage.\n\nThe Horned God has been explored within several psychological theories and has become a recurrent theme in fantasy literature.\n\nIn traditional and mainstream Wicca, the Horned God is viewed as the divine male principality, being both equal and opposite to the Goddess. The Wiccan god himself can be represented in many forms, including as the Sun God, the Sacrificed God and the Vegetation God, although the Horned God is the most popular representation. The pioneers of the various Wiccan or Witchcraft traditions, such as Gerald Gardner, Doreen Valiente and Robert Cochrane, all claimed that their religion was a continuation of the pagan religion of the Witch-Cult following historians who had purported the Witch-Cult's existence, such as Jules Michelet and Margaret Murray.\n\nFor Wiccans, the Horned God is \"the personification of the life force energy in animals and the wild\" and is associated with the wilderness, virility and the hunt. Doreen Valiente writes that the Horned God also carries the souls of the dead to the underworld.\n\nWiccans generally, as well as some other neopagans, tend to conceive of the universe as polarized into gender opposites of male and female energies. In traditional Wicca, the Horned God and the Goddess are seen as equal and opposite in gender polarity. However, in some of the newer traditions of Wicca, and especially those influenced by feminist ideology, there is more emphasis on the Goddess, and consequently the symbolism of the Horned God is less developed than that of the Goddess.\nIn Wicca the cycle of the seasons is celebrated during eight sabbats called The Wheel of the Year. The seasonal cycle is imagined to follow the relationship between the Horned God and the Goddess. The Horned God is born in winter, impregnates the Goddess and then dies during the autumn and winter months and is then reborn by the Goddess at Yule. The different relationships throughout the year are sometimes distinguished by splitting the god into aspects, the Oak King and the Holly King. The relationships between the Goddess and the Horned God are mirrored by Wiccans in seasonal rituals. There is some variation between Wiccan groups as to which sabbat corresponds to which part of the cycle. Some Wiccans regard the Horned God as dying at Lammas, August 1; also known as Lughnasadh, which is the first harvest sabbat. Others may see him dying at Mabon, the autumn equinox, or the second harvest festival. Still other Wiccans conceive of the Horned God dying on October 31, which Wiccans call Samhain, the ritual of which is focused on death. He is then reborn on Winter Solstice, December 21.\n\nOther important dates for the Horned God include Imbolc when, according to Valiente, he leads a wild hunt. In Gardnerian Wicca, the Dryghten prayer is recited at the end of every ritual meeting contains the lines referring to the Horned God:\n\nAccording to Sabina Magliocco, Gerald Gardner says (in 1959's \"The Meaning of Witchcraft\") that The Horned God is an Under-god, a mediator between an unknowable supreme deity and the people. (In Wiccan liturgy in the Book of Shadows, this conception of an unknowable supreme deity is referred to as \"Dryghtyn.\" It is not a personal god, but rather an impersonal divinity similar to the Tao of Taoism.)\n\nWhilst the Horned God is the most common depiction of masculine divinity in Wicca, he is not the only representation. Other examples include the Green Man and the Sun God. In traditional Wicca, however, these other representations of the Wiccan god are subsumed or amalgamated into the Horned God, as aspects or expressions of him. Sometimes this is shown by adding horns or antlers to the iconography. The Green Man, for example, may be shown with branches resembling antlers; and the Sun God may be depicted with a crown or halo of solar rays, that may resemble horns. These other conceptions of the Wiccan god should not be regarded as displacing the Horned God, but rather as elaborating on various facets of his nature. Doreen Valiente has called the Horned God \"the eldest of gods\" in both The Witches Creed and also in her Invocation To The Horned God.\n\nWiccans believe that The Horned God, as Lord of Death, is their \"comforter and consoler\" after death and before reincarnation; and that he rules the Underworld or Summerland where the souls of the dead reside as they await rebirth. Some, such as Joanne Pearson, believe that this is based on the Mesopotamian myth of Inanna's descent into the underworld, though this has not been confirmed.\n\nDoreen Valiente, a former High Priestess of the Gardnerian tradition, claimed that Gerald Gardner's Bricket Wood coven referred to the god as Cernunnos, or Kernunno, which is a Latin word, discovered on a stone carving found in France, meaning \"the Horned One\". Valiente claimed that the coven also referred to the god as Janicot, which she theorised was of Basque origin, and Gardner also used this name in his novel \"High Magic's Aid\".\n\nStewart Farrar, a High Priest of the Alexandrian tradition referred to the Horned God as Karnayna, which he believed was a corruption of the word Cernunnos. The historian Ronald Hutton has suggested that it instead came from the Arabic term Dhul-Qarnayn which meant \"Horned One\". This term had been used in the Qur'an to refer to Cyrus the Great or alternatively Alexander the Great, who considered himself the son of the horned deity Ammon-Zeus, and wore horns as a part of his regalia. Margaret Murray had mentioned this information in her 1933 book \"The God of the Witches\", and Hutton theorised that Alex Sanders had taken it from there, enjoying the fact that he shared his name with the ancient Macedonian emperor.\n\nIn the writings of Charles Cardell and Raymond Howard, the god was referred to as Atho. Howard had a wooden statue of Atho's head which he claimed was 2200 years old, but the statue was stolen in April 1967. Howard's son later admitted that his father had carved the statue himself.\n\nIn Cochrane's Craft, which was founded by Robert Cochrane, the Horned God was often referred to by a Biblical name; Tubal-cain, who, according to the Bible was the first blacksmith. In this neopagan concept, the god is also referred to as Brân, a Welsh mythological figure, Wayland, the smith in Germanic mythology, and Herne, a horned figure from English folklore.\n\nIn the neopagan tradition of Stregheria, founded by Raven Grimassi and loosely inspired by the works of Charles Godfrey Leland, the Horned God goes by several names, including Dianus, Faunus, Cern, and Actaeon.\n\nIn the Hinduism, the Horned God is referred to Pashupati, See Pashupati Seal.\n\nSherry Salman considers the image of the Horned God in Jungian terms, as an archetypal protector and mediator of the outside world to the objective psyche. In her theory the male psyche's 'Horned God' frequently compensates for inadequate fathering.\n\nWhen first encountered, the figure is a dangerous, 'hairy chthonic wildman' possessed of kindness and intelligence. If repressed, later in life The Horned God appears as the lord of the Otherworld, or Hades. If split off entirely, he leads to violence, substance abuse and sexual perversion. When integrated he gives the male an ego 'in possession of its own destructiveness' and for the female psyche gives an effective animus relating to both the physical body and the psyche.\n\nIn considering the Horned God as a symbol recurring in women's literature, Richard Sugg suggests the Horned God represents the 'natural Eros', a masculine lover subjugating the social-conformist nature of the female shadow, thus encompassing a combination of the shadow and animus. One such example is Heathcliff from Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\". Sugg goes on to note that female characters who are paired with this character usually end up socially ostracised, or worse – in an inverted ending to the male hero-story.\n\nFollowing the work of Robert Bly in the Mythopoetic men's movement, John Rowan proposes the Horned God as a \"Wild Man\" be used as a fantasy image or \"sub-personality\" helpful to men in humanistic psychology, and escaping from \"narrow societal images of masculinity\" encompassing excessive deference to women and paraphillia.\n\nMany horned deities are known to have been worshipped in various cultures throughout history. Evidence for horned gods appear very early in the human record. The so-called Sorcerer dates from perhaps 13,000 BCE. Twenty-one red deer headdresses, made from the skulls of the red deer and likely fitted with leather laces, have been uncovered at the Mesolithic site of Star Carr. They are thought to date from roughly 9,000 BCE. Several theories have been created to establish historical roots for modern Neopagan worship of a Horned God.\n\nFollowing the writings of suffragist Matilda Joslyn Gage and others, Margaret Murray, in her 1921 book \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\", proposed the theory that the witches of the early-modern period were remnants of a pagan cult and that the Christian Church had declared the god of the witches was in fact the Devil. Without recourse to any specific representation of this deity, Murray speculates that the head coverings common in inquisition-derived descriptions of the devil \"may throw light on one of the possible origins of the cult.\"\nIn 1931 Murray published a sequel, \"The God of the Witches\", which tries to gather evidence in support of her witch-cult theory. In Chapter 1 \"The Horned God\". Murray claims that various depictions of humans with horns from European and Indian sources, ranging from the paleolithic French cave painting of \"The Sorcerer\" to the Indic Pashupati to the modern English Dorset Ooser, are evidence for an unbroken, Europe-wide tradition of worship of a singular Horned God. Murray derived this model of a horned god cult from James Frazer and Jules Michelet.\n\nIn dealing with \"The Sorcerer\", the earliest evidence claimed, Murray based her observations on a drawing by Henri Breuil, which some modern scholars such as Ronald Hutton claim is inaccurate. Hutton states that modern photographs show the original cave art lacks horns, a human torso or any other significant detail on its upper half. However, others, such as celebrated prehistorian Jean Clottes, assert that Breuil's sketch is indeed accurate. Clottes stated that \"I have seen it myself perhaps 20 times over the years\".\n\nBreuil considered his drawing to represent a shaman or magician - an interpretation which gives the image its name. Murray having seen the drawing called Breuil's image \"the first depiction of a deity\", an idea which Breuil and others later adopted.\n\nMurray also used an inaccurate drawing of a mesolithic rock-painting at Cogul in northeast Spain as evidence of group religious ceremony of the cult, although the central male figure is not horned. The illustration she used of the Cogul painting leaves out a number of figures, human and animal, and the original is more likely a sequence of superimposed but unrelated illustrations, rather than a depiction of a single scene.\n\nDespite widespread criticism of Murray's scholarship some minor aspects of her work continued to have supporters.\n\nThe popular image of the Greek god Pan was removed from its classical context in the writings of the Romantics of the 18th century and connected with their ideals of a pastoral England. This, along with the general public's increasing lack of familiarity of Greek mythology at the time led to the figure of Pan becoming generalised as a 'horned god', and applying connotations to the character, such as benevolence that were not evident in the original Greek myths which in turn gave rise to the popular acceptance of Murray's hypothetical horned god of the witches.\nThe reception of \"Aradia\" amongst Neopagans has not been entirely positive. Clifton suggests that modern claims of revealing an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition, for example those of Leo Martello and Raven Grimassi, must be \"match[ed] against\", and compared with the claims in \"Aradia\". He further suggests that a lack of comfort with \"Aradia\" may be due to an \"insecurity\" within Neopaganism about the movement's claim to authenticity as a religious revival.\nValiente offers another explanation for the negative reaction of some neopagans; that the identification of Lucifer as the god of the witches in \"Aradia\" was \"too strong meat\" for Wiccans who were used to the gentler, romantic paganism of Gerald Gardner and were especially quick to reject any relationship between witchcraft and Satanism.\nIn 1985 Classical historian Georg Luck, in his \"Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds\", theorised that the origins of the Witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of Cernunnos, a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman Pan/Faunus, a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the Devil, and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.\n\nEliphas Levi's image of \"Baphomet\" serves as an example of the transformation of the Devil into a benevolent fertility deity and provided the prototype for Murray's horned god. Murray's central thesis that images of the Devil were actually of deities and that Christianity had demonised these worshippers as following Satan, is first recorded in the work of Levi in the fashionable 19th-century Occultist circles of England and France. Levi created his image of Baphomet, published in his \"Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie\" (1855), by combining symbolism from diverse traditions, including the \"Diable\" card of the 16th and 17th century Tarot of Marseille. Lévi called his image \"The Goat of Mendes\", possibly following Herodotus' account that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat's face and legs. Herodotus relates how all male goats were held in great reverence by the Mendesians, and how in his time a woman publicly copulated with a goat. E. A. Wallis Budge writes,\n\nMargaret Murray's theory of the historical origins of the Horned God has been used by Wiccans to create a myth of historical origins for their religion. There is no verifiable evidence to support claims that the religion originates earlier than the mid-20th century.\nModern scholarship has disproved Margaret Murray's theory, however various horned gods and mother goddesses were indeed worshipped in the British Isles during the ancient and early Medieval periods.\n\nThe \"father of Wicca\", Gerald Gardner, who adopted Margaret Murray's thesis, claimed Wicca was a modern survival of an ancient pan-European pagan religion. Gardner states that he had reconstructed elements of the religion from fragments, incorporating elements from Freemasonry, the Occult, and Theosophy, which came together in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, where Gardner met Aleister Crowley, whose influence became the basis for Wiccan magical practices. \nGerald Gardner was initiated into the O.T.O. by Aleister Crowley and subsequently went on to found the Neopagan religion of Wicca. Various scholars on early Wiccan history, such as Ronald Hutton, Philip Heselton, and Leo Ruickbie concur that witchcraft's early rituals, as devised by Gardner, contained much from Crowley's writings such as the Gnostic Mass. The third degree initiation ceremony in Gardnerian Wicca (including the Great Rite) is derived almost completely from the Gnostic Mass.\n\nGeorg Luck, repeats part of Murray's theory, stating that the Horned God may have appeared in late antiquity, stemming from the merging of Cernunnos, an antlered god of the Continental Celts, with the Greco-Roman Pan/Faunus, a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the devil, and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.\n\nIn 1908's \"The Wind in the Willows\" by Kenneth Grahame, in Chapter 7, \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\", Ratty and Mole meet a mystical horned being, powerful, fearsome and kind. Grahame's work was a significant part of the cultural milieu which stripped the Greek god Pan of his cultural identity in favor of an unnamed, generic horned deity which led to Murray's thesis of historical origins.\n\nOutside of works that predate the publication of Murray's thesis, horned god motifs and characters appear in fantasy literature that draws upon her work and that of her followers.\n\nIn the novel \"Childhood's End\" (1953) by Arthur C. Clarke, all humans have a collective premonition, also described as a memory of the future, of horned aliens which arrive to usher in a new phase of human evolution. The collective subconscious image of the horned aliens is what accounts for mankind's image of the devil or Satan. This theme is also explored in the \"Doctor Who\" story \"The Dæmons\" in 1971, where the local superstitions around a landmark known as The Devil's Hump prove to be based on reality, as aliens from the planet Dæmos have been affecting man's progress over the millennia and the Hump actually contains a spacecraft. The only Dæmon to appear is a classic interpretation of a horned satyr-like being with hooves.\n\nIn the critically acclaimed and influential 1950s TV series created by Nigel Kneale, \"Quatermass and the Pit\", depictions of supernatural horned entities, with specific reference to prehistoric cave-art and shamanistic horned head-dress are revealed to be a \"race-memory\" of psychic Martian grasshoppers, manifested at the climax of the film by a fiery horned god.\n\nMurray's theories has been seen to have had influence on \"The Blood on Satan's Claw\" (1971), where a murderous female-led cult worships a horned deity named Behemoth.\n\nMarion Zimmer Bradley, who acknowledges the influence of Murray, uses the figure of the \"horned god\" in her feminist fantasy transformation of Arthurian myth, \"Mists of Avalon\" (1984), and portrays ritualistic incest between King Arthur as the representative of the horned god and his sister Morgaine as the \"spring maiden\".\n\nIn the popular video game \"\", its expansion \"\" has a plot enemy known as Hircine, the Daedric god of the Hunt, who appears as a horned man with the face of a deer skull. He condemned his \"hounds\" (werewolves) to walk the mortal ground during the Bloodmoon until a champion defeats him or Bloodmoon falls. When in combat, Hircine appears as a horned wolf or bear.\n\nThe 1992 \"Discworld\" novel \"Lords and Ladies\", by Terry Pratchett, features a King of the Elves who is strongly reminiscent of the Horned God. Although not worshipped by the witches who are the heroines of the book (indeed, quite the reverse), they temporarily ally themselves with him out of necessity.\n"}

{"id": "7004425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7004425", "title": "Jerusalem Embassy Act", "text": "Jerusalem Embassy Act\n\nThe Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is a public law of the United States passed by the post-Republican Revolution 104th Congress on October 23, 1995. The proposed law was adopted by the Senate (93–5), and the House (374–37). The Act became law without a presidential signature on November 8, 1995.\n\nThe Act recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel and called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city. Its purpose was to set aside funds for the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from its location in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, by May 31, 1999. For this purpose it withheld 50% of the funds appropriated to the State Department specifically for \"Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad\" as allocated in fiscal year 1999 until the United States Embassy in Jerusalem had officially opened. Israel's declared capital is Jerusalem, but this is not internationally recognized, pending final status talks in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nDespite passage, the law allowed the President to invoke a six-month waiver of the application of the law, and reissue the waiver every six months on \"national security\" grounds. The waiver was repeatedly renewed by Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama. President Donald Trump signed a waiver in June 2017. On June 5, 2017, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of reunification of Jerusalem by 90-0. The resolution reaffirmed the Jerusalem Embassy Act and called upon the President and all United States officials to abide by its provisions. On December 6, 2017, Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and ordered the planning of the relocation of the embassy. However, following the announcement, Trump signed an embassy waiver again, delaying the move, as mandated by the Act, by at least six months. Legally, however, the U.S. embassy can be moved at any time without reliance on the Act.\n\nOn February 23, 2018, President Trump announced that the US Embassy in Israel would reopen at the Arnona consular services site of the then US Consulate-General in Jerusalem. The United States Embassy officially relocated to Jerusalem on May 14, 2018, to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence.\n\nJerusalem holds unique spiritual and religious interests, such as Holy Places and religious buildings or sites, among the world's Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Following World War I, the victorious Principal Allied Powers recognized these as \"a sacred trust of civilization\", and stipulated that the existing rights and claims connected with them should be safeguarded in perpetuity, under international guarantee. The terms of the British Balfour Declaration of 1917 were included in the Mandate for Palestine by the League of Nations. The US government was not a party to these agreements; but stated official foreign policy in 1919 was to 'acquiesce' in the Balfour Declaration, but not officially support Zionism. On September 21, 1922, the US Congress passed a joint resolution stating its support for a homeland in Palestine for the Jewish people but not at the expense of other cultures present at the time. This occurred virtually the same day the Palestine Mandate was approved by the League of Nations; although official government findings about the affected peoples' choices concerning self-determination were available in government circles, they were withheld from the public until the following December. US foreign policy remained unchanged. These competing nationalist claims led to increasing civil violence during the inter-war period; following World War II, the \"Question of Palestine\" was placed before the United Nations, as the League's successor agency.\n\nOn November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 181, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine; it contained a recommendation that Jerusalem be placed under a special international regime, a corpus separatum, administered by the United Nations and be separate from both the Jewish and Arab states envisioned. Following the conflict that ensued, cease-fires and the 1949 Armistice Agreements were negotiated and accepted by both sides. One of these resulted, in part, in a temporary division of Jerusalem. The relevant Armistice Agreement with Jordan was signed on April 3, 1949, but it was considered internationally as having no legal effect on the continued validity of the provisions of the partition resolution for the internationalization of Jerusalem. On April 25, 1949, King Abdullah officially changed the name of Transjordan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. He had secured the support of Great Britain (albeit qualified—Great Britain did not recognize the incorporation of East Jerusalem, maintaining that it ought to be part of a corpus separatum, an international enclave).\n\nOn December 5, 1949 the Israeli Cabinet, meeting in Tel Aviv, declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel, and on January 23, 1950, the First Knesset proclaimed that \"Jerusalem was, and had always been, the capital of Israel.\" Moreover, on April 24, 1950, the Jordan House of Deputies and House of Notables, in a joint session, adopted a resolution annexing the West Bank and Jerusalem. Because the status of Jerusalem had been included previously in the UN Partition Plan, most countries did not accept this Israeli position, and most embassies have been located elsewhere.\n\nThe United States has stated that its policy on Jerusalem refers specifically to the geographic boundaries of the area that were set out for the \"City of Jerusalem\", or Corpus Separatum, in Resolution 181, but since 1950, US diplomats have traveled regularly to Jerusalem from the US Embassy in Tel Aviv to conduct business with Israeli officials. The United States has also stated that Jerusalem was part of Mandate Palestine, and in a de jure sense, has not since become part of any other sovereignty. After the capture of the entire city and the adjacent West Bank in the 1967 Six-Day War, the United States again reaffirmed the desirability of establishing an international regime for the city of Jerusalem.\n\nAdvocacy for the Jerusalem Embassy Act reached a zenith during particularly critical times in negotiations for the Oslo Accords of the peace process, despite opposition from both the Israeli and American administrations. The embassy move was, and continued to be, delayed by successive United States government in order to appear neutral on the issue of Jerusalem. However, on December 6, 2017, President Donald Trump announced that the US recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and instructed the State Department to begin preparations to move the embassy.\n\nThere are allegations by a group of Palestinians that the site is owned by Palestinian Refugees whose property was confiscated by Israel in 1948.\n\nThe Act asserted that every country has a right to designate the capital of its choice, and that Israel has designated Jerusalem. The act notes that \"the city of Jerusalem is the seat of Israel's President, Parliament, and Supreme Court, and the site of numerous government ministries and social and cultural institutions.\" Jerusalem is defined as the spiritual center of Judaism. Furthermore, it stipulates that since the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967, religious freedom has been guaranteed to all.\n\nS.3(a)(2) and (3) also stated that \"Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel; and the United States Embassy in Israel should be established in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999\".\n\nAlthough the Senate and House votes preceded visits by then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert to Washington to celebrate the 3000th anniversary of King David's declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jews, little to no progress was achieved in the physical relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem until December 2017.\n\nSection 3 of the Act outlined the U.S. policy and set the initial parameters for the Secretary of State to report in order to receive the full funding — again, with a May 1999 target deadline for the appropriations. The section also briefly stated U.S. policy concerning the matter.\n\nThe major roadblock has been the question of what effect, if any, the relocation may symbolize for other interested parties or neighboring nations involved in the ongoing and sometimes quite contentious Mid-East diplomacy and foreign relations. For this reason, since the legislation's introduction, the consensus has been that this action poses considerable risk to United States national security at home and abroad.\n\nUnder the Constitution of the United States the President has exclusive authority to recognize foreign sovereignty over territory. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the provisions of the Embassy Relocation Act \"invade exclusive presidential authorities in the field of foreign affairs and are unconstitutional.\"\n\nFormer U.S. presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama have alluded to or explicitly stated the belief that Congressional resolutions attempting to legislate foreign policy infringe upon the Executive's authority and responsibility to carry out sound and effective U.S. foreign relations.\n\nRegarding the status of Jerusalem specifically, President Bush had deemed Congress' role as merely \"advisory\", stating that it \"impermissibly interferes with the President's constitutional authority\". The U.S. Constitution reserves the conduct of foreign policy to the President; resolutions of Congress, such as the ones found in the Authorization Act of 2003 that included the Jerusalem Embassy Act's provisions, makes the arguments in favor of legislating foreign policy from Congress extremely problematic if not arguably invalid for that Constitutional reason.\n\nEven from the Embassy Act's legislative beginnings, the question of Congress' over-reach, and whether it somehow usurped the Executive's authority or power over matters of foreign affairs, had played a subtle role in shaping the debate at the time. President Clinton took the unusual step of not signing the Embassy Act into law once Congress presented it to him, but instead, to show his disapproval, let 10 days of inaction pass, allowing the bill to return to Congress and automatically become law by Constitutional \"default\". Clinton's non-action reinforced this sticking point between the branches of the Federal government, without the potential public fallout from taking a \"negative stand\" on what appeared to be favorable, veto-proof legislation on the surface at the time.\n\nThis constitutional question was apparent while the legislation was working its way through both chambers; Sen. Dole's amendment adopted into the introduced language included a provision that, in part, returned to the Executive Branch the power over foreign affairs that it already had.\nEvery six months since 1998, all presidents have invoked the waiver provision under section 7 of the Act, based on national security grounds, to defer the relocation of the embassy from Tel Aviv. The last waiver was signed by President Trump on June 4, 2018.\n\nSince this provision went into effect in late 1998, all the presidents serving in office during this period have determined moving forward with the relocation would be detrimental to U.S. national security concerns and opted to issue waivers suspending any action on this front. However, a re-assessment has to take place every six months. In response, members of Congress have begun to include language to do away with the President's exclusivity in making the determinations or flat-out remove the waiver provision completely from the Embassy Act altogether.\n\nNoteworthy developments since the passage of the Act and well past the initial May 31, 1999 deadline's expiration:\n\n\n\n\nIn March 2011 a new bill, the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act of 2011 (H.R. 1006), was introduced. Cosponsored by fourteen Members of Congress, including House Europe Subcommittee Chairman Dan Burton (R), House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R) and House Middle East Subcommittee Chairman Steve Chabot (R), the bill would discontinue the Presidential waiver authority included in the 1995 Act, relocate the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and affirm the city as the undivided capital of Israel. This bill died at the end of 2011, having failed to clear the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the embassy waiver on June 1, 2017. The White House meanwhile stated that it did not represent a weakening of his support for Israel. It added that he stood by his promise of moving the embassy. On June 5, 2017, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of reunification of Jerusalem by 90-0. The resolution reaffirmed the Jerusalem Embassy Act and called upon the President and all United States officials to abide by its provisions.\n\nOn December 6, 2017, President Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and ordered the State Department to begin planning for the relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, following the announcement, Trump signed an embassy waiver again, delaying the move, as mandated by the Act, by at least six months. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that the relocation process will begin immediately, but that the relocation itself however could take years to complete. Legally, however, the U.S. embassy can be moved at any time outside of the scope of the Act.\n\nOn February 23, 2018, Trump announced that the US Embassy in Israel would reopen at the Arnona consular services site of the current US Consulate-General in Jerusalem on May 14, 2018, to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. This announcement was welcomed by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli government officials. However, the announcement was also condemned by Palestinian officials including Hanan Ashrawi and chief negotiator Saeb Erekat since the Embassy's reopening will coincide with the 70th anniversary of the \"Nakba\".\n\nHowever, despite the move of the Embassy to Jerusalem, President Trump signed on June 4, 2018 an executive order postponing the move of the Embassy to Jerusalem, although it already moved to that city. He was required to sign the order since the Jerusalem Embassy Act requires the US Ambassador to have a permanent residence in Jerusalem, a condition not yet fulfilled.\n\nOn October 18, 2018, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the US Embassy and Consulate-General in Jerusalem would be merged into a single diplomatic mission. In addition, Pompeo announced the establishment of special Palestinian Affairs Unit inside the Embassy to conduct relations with the Palestinians.\n\nA poll, taken in November 2017, by the Brookings Institution found that, of a national sample of 2,000 adults, 63% of Americans polled opposed the move of the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, while 31% supported it. Among Democrats, 81% opposed the move and 15% were in support, while among Republicans, 44% opposed the move and 49% supported it.\n\nIn the 2017 AJC Survey of American Jewish Opinion, done in September 2017, it was found that 16% of American Jews polled supported an immediate move of the embassy to Jerusalem, 36% wanted to move the embassy at a later date in conjunction with Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, 44% opposed moving the embassy, and 4% said they weren't sure.\n\n\n"}

Tello\n\nJulio César Tello (April 11, 1880 – June 3, 1947) was a Peruvian archaeologist. Tello is considered the \"father of Peruvian archeology\" and was America's first indigenous archaeologist. He made the major discoveries of the prehistoric Paracas culture and founded a national museum of archeology.\n\nTello was born a \"mountain Indian\" in an Andean village in Huarochirí Province, Peru; his family spoke Quechua, the most widely spoken indigenous language in the nation. He was able to gain a first-class education by persuading the Peruvian government to fund it. Tello completed his Bachelor's degree in medicine at the National University of San Marcos in Peru in 1909. While still a student, Tello studied the practice of trepanation among natives of Huarochirí and amassed a very large collection of skulls. He was also studying early pathologies in the population. His collection became the basis for a collection at his university. His abilities were recognized early and senior men acted as mentors.\n\nHe was awarded a scholarship by Harvard University, where he learned English and earned his Master's degree in anthropology in 1911. Next he went to Europe, where he studied archeology. In 1912 he attended the Congress of Americanists in England, a group in which he became prominent in later years. It was the beginning of his active international life.\n\nTello traveled widely during his career, and regularly invited other scholars to Peru, developing an international network. Although Tello published a number of papers in his lifetime, they appeared in little-known journals and newspapers, so they were not well known then even to Spanish speakers. For some time his findings and theories were not widely known outside of Peru because he did not publish in recognized academic journals.\nTello discovered the cutler chain and paracas , that 2 cultures were one of the most old cultures in Peru.If you want to see more of this cutlers go to Peru.In peru you learn something new every day !\n\nIn 1912 in England for a Congress of Americanists, Tello met Olive Mabel Cheesman, an English woman who was a student at London University. They married that year and had several children together. Their eldest daughter died in December 1938.\n\nIn 1919 Tello was working with a team at the \"Chavín de Huantar\" archeological site, where he discovered a stele since named for him, the Tello Obelisk. Construction of the first temple at this major religious center was dated to 850 BCE. The work of Tello and others established that the site had been a center of complex culture that lasted for several hundred years, to sometime between 500 and 300 BCE. Until late-20th century discoveries established the dates of the 5000-year-old Norte Chico site, the Chavín culture was believed to be the oldest complex civilization in Peru.\n\nTello is best known for his discovery in 1927 of 429 mummy bundles in the \"Cerro Colorado\" area of Peru on the Paracas Peninsula. He first visited the site on July 26, 1925, following a trail that had begun in 1915 when he had purchased ancient textiles in Pisco. On 25 October 1927, Tello and his team uncovered the first of hundreds of ceremonial mummified bundle burials. He was the first in Peru to practice a scientific method of archeological excavation, to preserve stratigraphy and elements to establish dating and context. In 1928 the team began to remove the mummies and textiles for safekeeping. His findings and interpretations have been the most significant source of information regarding the Paracas culture, which dates to 750 BCE – 100 CE.\n\nThe necropolis contained ritual burials, in which corpses were placed in baskets in a sitting position. Each of the bodies was covered by large textiles, works of woven cotton that had been embroidered in wool to create elaborate designs. He discovered these remarkable textiles which have been described as \"spectacular\". Tello and his team had collected 394 textiles and gained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation for their preservation. They put more than 180 on display by 1938 at the \"Instituto de Investigaciones Antropologicas\", where he and his team were on staff.\n\nUnlike some of his colleagues, Tello long believed that the Andean highlands had been important centers of ancient culture and made study of the area a focus of his work. His theory was proven by his work at sites such as Chavin de Huantar and Ayacucho, a center of Wari culture, as well as later scholars. In 1936 he, together with prominent scholars Alfred Kroeber, Samuel Lothrop, Wendell Bennett and others established the Institute for Andean Research (IAR), to organize and recognize contributions in the field.\n\nIn 1938 the President, Óscar R. Benavides, approved a reorganization of the national museums. Impressed with the Paracas textile collection, he authorized the new \"Museo de Antropolgia\" to house it. On January 3, 1939, Tello was named its first director. This is now the \"Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú\".\n\nThe Julio C Tello Museum on the Paracas Peninsula is named in his honour. After the reserve was established in 1975, the museum was built to house artifacts and interpret the archeology and culture of the Paracas, as well as the rich natural life of the marine reserve.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37861192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37861192", "title": "Land reforms by country", "text": "Land reforms by country\n\nAgrarian reform and land reform have been a recurring theme of enormous consequence in world history. They are often highly political and have been achieved (or attempted) in many countries.\n\nGetúlio Vargas, who rose to presidency in Brazil following the Brazilian Revolution of 1930, promised a land reform but reneged on his promise.\n\nA first attempt to make a nation-wide reform was set up in the government of José Sarney (1985–1990) as a result of the strong popular movement that had contributed to the fall of the military government. According to the 1988 Constitution of Brazil, the government is required to \"expropriate for the purpose of agrarian reform, rural property that is not performing its social function\" (Article 184). However, the \"social function\" mentioned there is not well defined, and hence the so-called First Land Reform National Plan never was put into force.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the Landless Workers' Movement has led a strong campaign on favor of fulfilling the constitutional requirement to land reform. They also took direct action by forceful occupation of unused lands. Their campaign has managed to get some advances for the past 10 years, during the Fernando Cardoso and Lula da Silva administrations.\n\nIt is overseen by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform.\n\nLand in Bolivia was unequally distributed – 92% of the cultivable land was held by large estates – until the Bolivian national revolution in 1952. Then, the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement government abolished forced peasantry labor and established a program of expropriation and distribution of the rural property of the traditional landlords to the indigenous peasants. A unique feature of the reform in Bolivia was the organization of peasants into syndicates. Peasants were not only granted land but their militias also were given large supplies of arms. The peasants remained a powerful political force in Bolivia during all subsequent governments. By 1970, 45% of peasant families had received title to land. Land reform projects continued in the 1970s and 1980s. A 1996 agrarian reform law increased protection for smallholdings and indigenous territories, but also protected absentee landholders who pay taxes from expropriation. Reforms were continued at 2006, with the Bolivian senate passing a bill authorizing the government redistribution of land among the nation's mostly indigenous poor.\n\nAttempts at land reform began under the government of Jorge Alessandri in 1960, were accelerated during the government of Eduardo Frei Montalva (1964–1970), and reached its climax during the 1970-1973 presidency of Salvador Allende. Farms of more than were expropriated. After the 1973 coup the process was halted and – up to a point – reversed by the market forces.\n\nAlfonso López Pumarejo (1934–1938) passed Law 200 of 1936, which allowed for the expropriation of private properties, in order to promote \"social interest\".\n\nLater attempts declined, until the National Front presidencies of Alberto Lleras Camargo (1958–1962) and Carlos Lleras Restrepo (1966–1970), which respectively created the Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA) and further developed land entitlement. In 1968 and 1969 alone, the INCORA issued more than 60,000 land titles to farmers and workers.\n\nDespite this, the process was then halted and the situation began to reverse itself, as the subsequent violent actions of drug lords, paramilitaries, guerrillas and opportunistic large landowners severely contributed to a renewed concentration of land and to the displacement of small landowners.\n\nIn the early 21st century, tentative government plans to use the land legally expropriated from drug lords and/or the properties given back by demobilized paramilitary groups have not caused much practical improvement yet.\n\nLand reform was among the chief planks of the revolutionary platform of 1959. Almost all large holdings were seized by the National Institute for Agrarian Reform (INRA), which dealt with all areas of agricultural policy. A ceiling of 166 acres (67 hectares) was established, and tenants were given ownership rights, though these rights are constrained by government production quotas and a prohibition of real estate transactions.\n\nLand reform occurred during the \"Ten Years of Spring\" (1944–1954) under the governments of Juan José Arévalo and Jacobo Arbenz, after a popular revolution forced out dictator Jorge Ubico. The largest part of the reform was the law officially called Decree 900, which redistributed all uncultivated land from landholdings that were larger than . If the estates were between and in size, uncultivated land was expropriated only if less than two-thirds of it was in use. The law benefited 500,000 people, or one-sixth of the Guatemalan Population. Historians have called this reform as one of the most successful land reforms in history. However, the United Fruit Company felt threatened by the law and lobbied the United States government, which was a factor in the US-backed coup that deposed the Jacobo Arbenz in 1954. The majority of the reform was rolled back by the US supported military dictatorship that followed.\n\nIn 1856, the first land reform was driven by the (the Lerdo law), enacted by the liberal government. One of the aims of the reform government was to develop the economy by returning to productive cultivation the underutilized lands of the Church and the municipal communities (Indian commons), which required the distribution of these lands to small owners. This was to be accomplished through the provisions of Ley Lerdo that prohibited ownership of land by the Church and the municipalities. The reform government also financed its war effort by seizing and selling church property and other large estates. After the war, the principles of the Ley Lerdo were perverted by President Porfirio Diaz, which caused land concentration and contributed to causing the Mexican Revolution in 1910. A certain degree of land reform was introduced, albeit unevenly, as part of the Mexican Revolution.\n\nIn 1934, president Lázaro Cárdenas passed the 1934 Agrarian Code and accelerated the pace of land reform. He helped redistribute of land, of which were expropriated from American owned agricultural property. This caused conflict between Mexico and the United States. Agrarian reform had come close to extinction in the early 1930s. The first few years of the Cárdenas' reform were marked by high food prices, falling wages, high inflation, and low agricultural yields. In 1935 land reform began sweeping across the country in the periphery and core of commercial agriculture. The Cárdenas alliance with peasant groups was awarded by the destruction of the hacienda system. Cárdenas distributed more land than all his revolutionary predecessors put together, a 400% increase. The land reform justified itself in terms of productivity; average agricultural production during the three-year period from 1939 to 1941 was higher than it had been at any time since the beginning of the revolution.\n\nStarting with the government of Miguel Alemán (1946–52), land reform steps made in previous governments were rolled back. Alemán's government allowed capitalist entrepreneurs to rent peasant land. This created phenomenon known as neolatifundismo, where land owners build up large-scale private farms on the basis of controlling land which remains ejidal but is not sown by the peasants to whom it is assigned.\n\nIn 1970, President Luis Echeverría began his term by declaring land reform dead. In the face of peasant revolt, he was forced to backtrack, and embarked on the biggest land reform program since Cárdenas. Echeverría legalized take-overs of huge foreign-owned private farms, which were turned into new collective ejidos.\n\nIn 1988, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was elected. In December 1991, he amended Article 27 of the Constitution, making it legal to sell land and allow peasants to put up their land as collateral for a loan.\n\nFrancisco Madero and Emiliano Zapata were strongly identified with land reform, as are the present-day (as of 2006) Zapatista Army of National Liberation.\n\nToday, most Mexican peasants are landowners. However, their holdings are usually too small, and farmers must supplement their incomes by working for the remaining landlords, and/or traveling to the United States.\n\nSee also: México Indígena (2005-2008 project)\n\nDuring and after the Nicaraguan Revolution (1979), the Sandinista government officially announced their political platform which included land reform.\n\nThe last months of Sandinista rule were criticized for the Piñata Plan, which distributed large tracts of land to prominent Sandinistas. After their loss in the 1990 elections, most of the Sandinista leaders held most of the private property and businesses that had been confiscated and nationalized by the FSLN government. This process became known as the and was tolerated by the new Chamorro government.\n\nLand reform in the 1950s largely eliminated a centuries-old system of debt peonage.\n\nFurther land reform occurred after the 1968 coup by left-wing colonel Juan Velasco Alvarado. The military dictatorship under General Juan Velasco Alvarado (1968–75) launched a large-scale agrarian reform movement that attempted to redistribute land, hoping to break Peru's traditionally inequitable pattern of land holding and the hold of traditional oligarchy. The model used by Velasco to bring about change was the associative enterprise, in which former salaried rural workers and independent peasant families would become members of different kinds of cooperatives. About 22 million acres were redistributed, more land than in any reform program outside of Cuba. Unfortunately, productivity suffered as peasants with no management experience took control. The military government continued to spend huge amounts of money to transform Peru's agriculture to socialized ownership and management. These state expenditures are to blame for the enormous increase in Peru's external debt at the beginning of the 1970s. State bankruptcy was partly caused by the cheap credit the government extended to promote agrarian development, state subsidies, and administrative expenditures to carry out the agrarian reform during this period. The more radical effects of this reform were reversed by president Fernando Belaúnde Terry in the 1980s.\n\nA third land reform occurred as part of a counterterrorism effort against the Shining Path during the Internal conflict in Peru roughly 1988–1995, led by Hernando de Soto and the Institute for Liberty and Democracy during the early years of the government of Alberto Fujimori, before the latter's \"auto-coup\".\n\nBefore 1998, 60 percent of the land in Venezuela was owned by less than 1 percent of the population.In 2001, Hugo Chávez's government enacted Plan Zamora to redistribute government and unused private land to \"campesinos\" in need. \n\nThe plan met with heavy opposition which lead to a coup attempt in 2002. When Pedro Carmona took over the presidency during that event, he reversed the land reform. However, the reversal was declared null when the coup failed and Chávez returned to power. By the end of 2003, 60,000 families had received temporary title to a total of 55,000 km² of land under this plan.\n\nDespite the land reforms carried out by the government, which, according to some sources, have reduced the so-called \"latifundios\" (which means \"big landownership\"), most receivers of the land didn't have any knowledge about how to cultivate the land and grow crops. In many cases, peasants didn't even water, since water infrastructures were still missing in most of the regions.\n\nMoreover, in some cases, \"campesitos\" didn't gain direct ownership of the land, but only the right to farm it without having to pay the rent and without sanctions from the government, and in some cases the land wasn't given to single peasant family, but managed in communes, according to the rules of socialism. According to some sources, the expropriated land amounts to 4-5 million hectares.\n\nThe above problems, together with a poor treatment of private companies from the government's side and the absence of free market, led to a shortage crisis in Venezuela, which is still ongoing, even though the redistribution of land itself (not carried out through the \"communes\") can be considered a positive achievement and it didn't probably cause the crisis.\n\nLand in Paraguay has been known to be unequally distributed prolonging rural poverty in Paraguay. Unequal distribution of land was seen more prominent under the 35-year dictatorship of President Alfredo Stroessner in the years of 1954 to 1989. Stroessner was also known to take away many campesino's land in order to give it to military officials, foreign corporations and civilian supporters. As well as faked an alliance with the Colorado Party in order to distribute public land. Campesinos' cries for help for land reform were ignored and the prosecution against them continued, causing them to suffer from high poverty rates. June S. Beittel said that as a result of the unequal distribution of land it left, “ rural areas the most poverty-stricken.” In the year of 1954, the Truth and Justice Committee focused on getting justice for the abuses many Campesinos were facing from their own government. \n\nParaguayan democracy came a long way after its 35-year dictatorship, but the unequal distribution of land is still a problem for the nation since their economy is one that is dependent on its agriculture. A census in 2008 revealed that “80 percent of agriculture land is held by just 1.6 percent of landowners, with the 600 largest properties occupying 40 percent of the total productive land. More than 300,000 family farmers have no land at all.” Paraguayans have formed unions such as National Federation of Campesinos (FNC) who has fought for justice on the unequal land distributions in Latin America they have helped many campesinos reclaim acres of land since 1989. The ongoing inequality of land distribution has lead to a demand for land regulation. \n\nParaguay has become the fourth world's largest distributors of soy. Due to this distribution, soy companies are the largest landowners, taking over 80 percent of the land. This production has negatively impacted the lives of rural peasants by leaving them without their own land. Thus, on March 2017, the streets of Paraguay’s capital were filled with more than 1000 campesinos demanding for agrarian reform. \n\nThousands of rural peasants demand access to land, fair agricultural prices for what they produce and technical assistance. Due to the increase in soy production, campesinos has been forced out of their lands leading them to demand land regulations. This demand of the stabilization and fairness of agricultural prices is a result of Paraguay’s government failing to sustain secure prices for their produce which are leaving them to live in extreme poverty. In the effect of no secure economy for their produce, campesinos mandate technical help.\n\nA great majority of Paraguayans continue to practice subsistence agriculture in the depths of the Paraguayan \"campo\" (countryside). Despite their struggle with poverty, inequality and land rights, Paraguayans are proud of their campesino structure and the traditional culture that arises from it, with this culture being the most prominent in Paraguay than anywhere else in Latin America.\n\nIn December 2017, “over one-third of the population was impoverished and 19% were living in ‘extreme poverty’”, so “the further centralization of land and power has only functioned to exacerbate socio-economic issues.” Thus, the campesino movement is still ongoing due to the desire to continue their campesino traditions and to be able to make a living wage doing so.\n\nThe Ottoman Land Code of 1858 (1274 in the Islamic calendar) was the beginning of a systematic land reform programme started during the Tanzimat period by Sultan Abdülmecid I of the Ottoman Empire during the latter half of the 19th century, with the overall aims of increasing state revenue generated from land and for the state to be able to have greater control over individual plots of land. This was followed by the 1873 land emancipation act.\n\nInitially, Egyptian land reform essentially abolished the political influence of major land owners. However, land reform only resulted in the redistribution of about 15% of Egypt's land under cultivation, and by the early 1980s, the effects of land reform in Egypt drew to a halt as the population of Egypt moved away from agriculture. The Egyptian land reform laws were greatly curtailed under Anwar Sadat and eventually abolished.\n\nSignificant land reform in Iran took place under the shah as part of the socio-economic reforms of the White Revolution, begun in 1962, and agreed upon through a public referendum. At this time the Iranian economy was not performing well and there was political unrest. Essentially, the land reforms amounted to a huge redistribution of land to rural peasants who previously had no possibility of owning land as they were poorly paid labourers.\nThe land reforms continued from 1962 until 1971 with three distinct phases of land distribution: private, government-owned and endowed land. These reforms resulted in the newly created peasant landowners owning six to seven million hectares, around 52-63% of Iran's agricultural land. According to Country-Data, even though there had been a considerable redistribution of land, the amount received by individual peasants was not enough to meet most families' basic needs, \"About 75 percent of the peasant owners [however] had less than 7 hectares, an amount generally insufficient for anything but subsistence agriculture.\".\nBy 1979 a quarter of prime land was in disputed ownership and half of the productive land was in the hands of 200,000 absentee landlords The large land owners were able to retain the best land with the best access to fresh water and irrigation facilities. In contrast, not only were the new peasant land holdings too small to produce an income but the peasants also lacked both quality irrigation system and sustained government support to enable them to develop their land to make a reasonable living. Set against the economic boom from oil revenue it became apparent that the Land Reforms did not make life better for the rural population: according to Amid, \"..only a small group of rural people experienced increasing improvements in their welfare and poverty remained the lot of the majority\".\nMoghadam argues that the structural changes to Iran, including the land reforms, initiated by the White Revolution, contributed to the revolution in 1979 which overthrew the Shah and turned Iran into an Islamic republic.\n\nUnder British Mandate, Iraq's land was moved from communal land owned by the tribe to tribal sheikhs that agreed to work with the British. Known as compradors, these families controlled much of Iraq's arable land until the end of British rule in 1958. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, more and more land began to be centered in the hands of just a couple families. By 1958 eight individual families owned almost 1 million acres. \nHowever, the British did attempt to instill some reforms to increase the productivity of the land in Iraq. In 1926 the Pump Law was introduced, essentially legislating that all newly irrigated land would be tax free for 4 years. This led to some short term gains in land productivity. If land was cultivated for 15 years, it then became the property of the person who cultivated that land. From 1914 to 1943 there was an increase from 1 million to 4.25 million acres of land developed. Unfortunately, irrigation of the land was irresponsible, and many farmers didn't allow for drainage, which led to a buildup of salt and minerals in the land, killing its productivity.\n\nIn 1958 the rise of the Communist Party led to the seizing of much of the land by the Iraqi government. Landholdings were capped at 600 acres in arable areas and 1200 acres in areas that had rainfall. The concentrated landholdings by the state were then redistributed among the populace, in amounts of 20 acres in irrigated land, with 40 acres in land with rainfall.\n\nIn 1970, the Ba'th Party, led by Saddam Hussein began instituting a wide series of sweeping land reforms. The intent of the reforms was to remove control of land owned by the traditional rural elites and redistribute it to peasant families. Modeled after the 1958 land reforms, much of the state land was rented out, though often to people who originally owned the large swathes of land. The key to this new reform was the Agrarian Reform Law of 1970.Between 1970 and 1982, 264,400 farmers received grants of land. However, these reforms did not contribute to an improvement in the production of agricultural goods, leading the regime to increase its imports of food products.\n\nAs elsewhere in North Africa, lands formerly held by European farmers have been taken over. The nationalisation of agricultural land in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia led to the departure of the majority of Europeans.\n\nLand reforms were first implemented in Syria during 1958. The Agricultural Relations Law laid down a redistribution of rights in landownership, tenancy and management.\n\nThe reforms were halted in 1961 due to a culmination of factors, including opposition from large landowners and severe crop failure during a drought between 1958 and 1961, whilst Syria was a member of the doomed United Arab Republic (UAR).\n\nAfter the Ba'ath Party gained power in 1963 the reforms were resumed. The reforms were portrayed by the governing Ba'ath as politically motivated to benefit the rural property-less communities. According to Zaki al-Arsuzi, a co-founder of the Ba'ath Party, the reforms would \"liberate 75 percent of the Syrian population and prepare them to be citizens qualified to participate in the building of the state\".\n\nIt has been argued that the land reform represented work by the 'socialist government', however, by 1984 the private sector controlled 74 percent of Syria's arable land. This questions both Ba'ath claims of commitment to the redistribution of land to the majority of peasants as well as the state government being socialist (if it allowed the majority of land to be owned in the private sector how could it truly be socialist?). Hinnebusch argued that the reforms were a way of galvanising support from the large rural population: \"they [Ba'ath Party members] used the implementation of agrarian reform to win over and organise peasants and curb traditional power in the countryside\". To this extent the reforms succeeded and resulted with an increase in Ba'ath party membership. They also prevented political threat emerging from rural areas by bringing the rural population into the system as supporters.\n\nSee also: The Land Reform of 1919–1940: Lithuania and the Countries of East and Central Europe.\n\nAlbania has gone through three waves of land reform since the end of World War II: in 1946, the land in estates and large farms was expropriated by the communist government and redistributed among small peasants; in the 1950s, the land was reorganized into large-scale collective farms; and after 1991, the land was again redistributed among private smallholders.\n\nEstonia has witnessed two periods of land reform in 1919 and 1991 which occurred very shortly after the declaration of Estonian independence and the restoration of independence respectfully. The act of 1919 was primarily concerned with the transferral of land ownership from Baltic Germans to ethnic Estonians. The 1991 act was instead aimed at the transfer of land ownership from the state (having been nationalised under Soviet occupation) to private individuals based on historic land ownership in 1940 as well as the protection of the legal rights of the present users of land.\n\nIn the general reparcelling out of land, begun in 1757 when Finland was a part of Sweden, the medieval model of all fields consisting of numerous strips, each belonging to a farm, was replaced by a model of fields and forest areas each belonging to a single farm. In the further reparcellings, which started in 1848 when Finland was part of Russia, the idea of concentrating all the land in a farm to a single piece of real estate was reinforced. In these reparcelling processes, the land is redistributed in direct proportion to earlier prescription. Both the general reparcelling and the further reparcelling processes are still active in some parts of the country, and a new reparcelling can be initiated when the local need for such reparcelling arises. After the Finnish Civil War, when Finland had become independent, a series of land reforms followed. These included the compensated transfer of lease-holdings (torppa) to the leasers and prohibition of forestry companies to acquire land. After the Second World War, Karelians evacuated from areas ceded to Russia were given land in remaining Finnish areas, taken from public and private holdings with less than full compensation to the previous owners. Also the war veterans, and their widows benefited from these allotments. As a result of post-WWII land reform, 30,000 new farms were established, 33,000 small farms received more land and 67,000 families received either a plot for a single-family home or a homestead with some arable land.\n\nAt the 19th century, most of the land in Ireland belonged to large landowners, most of them of English origin. Most of the Irish population were tenants, having few rights and forced to pay high rents. This situation was a contributory factor to the Great Irish Famine of 1845-1852 and the main cause of the Land War's of 1870s-1890s.\n\nThe governments of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland responded to the agitations in Ireland with a series of land acts, beginning with the First Irish Land Act 1870 (initiated by prime minister William Ewart Gladstone), followed by further five land acts overseen by a Land Commission, prior to independence in 1922, by which time over 90% of lands had transferred from landlords to their former tenant farmers on negotiated terms with funding provided by the UK government.\n\nLand reform has been a long-standing and widespread problem before the XX century, especially in South Italy. Despite the vain attempts of the governments to redistribute the land in South Italy (the so-called \"Mezzogiorno\"), from the pragmatic decree \" De administratione Universitatum \" (1792) of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies to the law \"Leggi eversive delle feudalità\" (which literally means \"laws abolishing feudalism\") in 1806-1808, enacted by Joseph Bonaparte, the issue remained largely unsolved, mainly because of the strenuous opposition of the great landowners, unwilling to lose their privileges and to allow the emancipation of the peasant class. Even with the Unification of Italy, despite the promises of the abolition of the so-called \"latifondi\" (\"large estates\"), the problem remained unsolved. South Italy's big landowners, which had been loyal to the Bourbons until the 1860, actively contributed to the unificiation of Italy in order to not lose its prestige, and expropriating estates from them would have implied, for the Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946), to have a powerful enemy. South Italy's peasants, disappointed and irritated, rebelled and provoked a bloody civil war, known as Post-Unification Brigandage.\n\nThe first effective land reform was carried out in 1950, right after the birth of the Italian Republic. Italian Parliament passed the decree \"legge stralcio n. 841 del 21 ottobre 1950\", which provided the legal basis for land expropriation and redistribution. The redistribution occurred over a longer period of time, about 10-20 years.\n\nThe decree, financed in part with the funds of Marshall Plan, launched by the United States in 1947, but also opposed by conservative members of the American administration probably was, according to some scholars, the most important reform of the aftermath of World War II. The decree provided that the land had to be distributed to peasants through compulsory purchase, thus turning them into small entrepreneurs no longer subjected to large landowners. On one side, the reform had a positive outcome to the population, but, on the other side, it also considerably reduced Italian farms size, reducing the chances for bigger companies to grow. However, this drawback was attenuated and, in some cases, eliminated by implementing forms of cooperation. Agricultural cooperatives started to spread, and, since then, agriculture turned into an entrepreneurial business which could expand, plan its production and centralize the sale of products.\n\nAfter the land reform of 1950, large estates (\"latifondi\") by law cannot be bigger than 300 hectares (3 km²). Before the 1950, large estates were widespread, especially in South Italy. Nowadays large estate aren't present anymore on Italy's territory.\n\nFor example, in Sicily before the 1950, large estates larger than 500 hectares (5 km²) were 228.. Moreover, 20.6 percent of the island's land was owned by only 282 big landowners..\n\nIn the region Abruzzo, large estates were also widespread. The most notable case is perhaps the estate of the Torlonia family, which owned large estates near Piana del Fucino; its size was more than 14,000 hectares (140 km²), and it was redistributed to 5,000 Italian families of landless farmers.\n\nCrop yield significantly increased after 1950, since agriculture had become intensive. Following the development of industry, agriculture has now become a marginal sector of Italian economy, but, by implementing modern agricultural techniques, its profitability per hectare increased.\n\nThe Emancipation reform of 1861, effected during the reign of Alexander II of Russia, abolished serfdom throughout Russia. More than 23 million people received their liberty. Serfs were granted the full rights of free citizens, gaining the rights to marry without having to gain consent, to own property and to own a business. The Manifesto prescribed that peasants would be able to buy the land from the landlords.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 20th century, the vast majority of Russian peasants held their land in communal ownership within peasant communities called mirs, which acted as village governments and cooperatives. Arable land was divided in sections based on soil quality and distance from the village. Each household had the right to claim one or more strips from each section depending on the number of adults in the household. This communal system was abolished in 1906 by the capitalist-oriented Stolypin reforms. The reforms introduced the unconditional right of individual landownership. They encouraged peasants to buy their share of the community lands, leave the communities and settle in privately owned settlements called Khutors. By 1910 the share of private settlements among all rural households in the European part of Russia was estimated at 10.5%.\n\nThe Stolypin reforms and the majority of their benefits were reversed after the communist revolution of 1917. The Decree on Land, issued by Lenin at 1917, and the \"Fundamental Law of Land Socialization\" of 1918, decreed that private ownership of land is totally abolished - land may not be sold, purchased, leased, mortgaged, or otherwise alienated. All land, whether state, crown, monastery, church, factory, entailed, private, public, peasant, etc., shall be confiscated without compensation and become the property of the whole people, and pass into the use of all those who cultivate it. These decrees were superseded by the 1922 Land Code. After the universal agricultural collectivization, land codes of the Soviet republics lost their significance. See Agriculture in the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the collapse of the USSR, a new land code was enacted, allowing private land ownership. See Agriculture in Russia.\n\nIn 1757, the general reparcelling out of land began. In this process, the medieval principle of dividing all the fields in a village into strips, each belonging to a farm, was changed into a principle of each farm consisting of a few relatively large areas of land. The land was redistributed in proportion to earlier possession of land, while uninhabited forests far from villages were socialized (see Agriculture in Sweden#History).\n\nIn the 20th century, Sweden, almost non-violently, arrived at regulating the length minimum of tenant farming contracts at 25 years.\n\nThere have been many land reformers in the United Kingdom, but most actual land reform has taken place in Scotland rather than England and Wales.\nAdvocates of land reform in Britain have included the 17th-century Diggers, John Stuart Mill, Alfred Russel Wallace, and Jesse Collings. Currently the Labour Land Campaign promotes the case for a land value tax, one of the results of which would be some land reform. The Green Party of England and Wales and the Scottish Green Party support land value tax.\n\nIn the 21st century, land reform in Scotland has focused on the abolition and modernisation of Scotland's antiquated feudal land tenure system, security of tenure for crofters and decentralisation of Scotland's highly concentrated private land ownership. Scotland's land reform is distinct from other contemporary land reforms in its focus on community land ownership\n, with the Land Reform (Scotland) Acts of 2003 and 2016 establishing the Community Right to Buy, allowing rural and urban communities first right of refusal to purchase local land when it comes up for sale. Crofting communities are granted a similar Right to Buy though they do not require a willing seller to buy out local crofting land. Under the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015 and Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016, Scottish ministers can grant a compulsory sale order for vacant or derelict private land or land which, if owned by the local community, could further sustainable development.\n\nHistorically, Ethiopia was divided into the northern highlands, which constituted the core of the old Christian kingdom, and the southern highlands, most of which were brought under imperial rule by conquest. In the northern regions, the major form of ownership was a type of communal system known as \"rist\". According to this system, all descendants of an individual founder were entitled to a share, and individuals had the right to use a plot of family land. Rist was hereditary, inalienable, and inviolable. No user of any piece of land could sell his or her share outside the family or mortgage or bequeath his or her share as a gift, as the land belonged not to the individual but to the descent group. Most peasants in the northern highlands held at least some rist land. Absentee landlordism was rare, and landless tenants were estimated at only about 20% of holdings. On the contrary, in the southern provinces, few farmers owned the land on which they worked. After the conquest, officials divided southern land equally among the state, the church, and the indigenous population. Tenancy in the southern provinces ranged between 65% and 80% of the holdings, and tenant payments to landowners averaged as high as 50% of the produce. In the easternlowland periphery and the Great Rift Valley, most land were used for grazing. The pastoral social structure is based on a kinship system with strong interclan connections; grazing and water rights are regulated by custom.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the government tried to modernize the agriculture by granting large tracts of traditional grazing lands to large corporations and converting them into large-scale commercial farms. In the north and south, peasant farmers lacked the means to improve production because of the fragmentation of holdings, a lack of credit, and the absence of modern facilities. Particularly in the south, the insecurity of tenure and high rents killed the peasants' incentive to improve production. Further, those attempts by the Imperial government to improve the peasant's title to their land were often met with suspicion. By the mid-1960s, many sectors of Ethiopian society favored land reform. University students led the land reform movement and campaigned against the government's reluctance to introduce land reform programs and the lack of commitment to integrated rural development.\n\nIn 1974, The socialist Derg government rose to power, and on March 4, 1975, the Derg announced its land reform program. The government nationalized rural land without compensation, abolished tenancy, forbade the hiring of wage labor on private farms, ordered all commercial farms to remain under state control, and granted each peasant family so-called \"possessing rights\" to a plot of land not to exceed ten hectares. The Ethiopian Church lost all its land. Although the Derg gained little respect during its rule, this reform resulted in a rare show of support for the junta.\n\nTenant farmers in southern Ethiopia welcomed the land reform, but in the northern highlands many people resisted land reform and perceived it as an attack on their rights to rist land. The lowland peripheries were only slightly affected by the reforms.\n\nThe land reform destroyed the feudal order. It changed landowning patterns – particularly in the south – in favor of peasants and small landowners. It also provided the opportunity for peasants to participate in local matters by permitting them to form associations.\n\nIn the 1960s, president Jomo Kenyatta launched a peaceful land reform program based on \"willing buyer-willing seller\". It was funded by Great Britain, the former colonial power.\n\nIn 2006, president Mwai Kibaki said it will repossess all land owned by \"absentee landlords\" in the coastal strip and redistribute it to squatters.\n\nNamibia's colonial past had resulted in a situation where about 20% of the population (mostly white settlers) owned about 75 percent of all the land.\nIn 1990, shortly after Namibia got its independence, its first president Sam Nujoma initiated a plan for land reform, in which land would be redistributed from whites to blacks. legislation passed in September 1994, with a compulsory, compensated approach.\nThe land reform has been slow, mainly because Namibia's constitution only allows land to be bought from farmers willing to sell. Also, the price of land is very high in Namibia, which further complicates the matter.\n\nBy 2007, some 12% of the total commercial farmland in the country was taken away from white farmers and given to black citizens.\n\nThe Natives' Land Act of 1913 \"prohibited the establishment of new farming operations, sharecropping or cash rentals by blacks outside of the reserves\" where they were forced to live.\n\nIn 1991, after a long anti-apartheid struggle led by the African National Congress, State President F. W. de Klerk declared the repeal of several apartheid rules, particularly: the Population Registration Act, the Group Areas and the Natives' Land Act. A catch-all Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act was passed. These measures ensured no one could claim, or be deprived of, any land rights on the basis of race.\n\nIn 1994, shortly after the African National Congress came to power in South Africa, it initiated a land reform process focused on three areas: restitution, land tenure reform and land redistribution. Restitution, where the government compensates (monetary) individuals who had been forcefully removed, has been very unsuccessful and the policy has now shifted to redistribution.\n\nInitially, land was bought from its owners (willing seller) by the government (willing buyer) and redistributed, in order to maintain public confidence in the land market.\nThis system has proved to be very difficult to implement, because many owners do not actually see the land they are purchasing and are not involved in the important decisions made at the beginning of the purchase and negotiation.\n\nIn 2000 the South African Government decided to review and change the redistribution and tenure process to a more decentralized and area based planning process. The idea is to have local integrated development plans in 47 districts.\n\nBy 1979, when Zimbabwe gained independence, 46.5% of the country's arable land was owned by around 6,000 commercial farmers, and white farmers, who made up less than 1% of the population, owned 70% of the best farming land.\n\nAs part of the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979, president Robert Mugabe initiated a \"willing buyer, willing seller\" plan, in which white land-owners were encouraged to sell their lands to the government, with partial funding from Britain. Around 71,000 families (perhaps 500,000 people) settled on 3.5 million hectares of former white-owned land under this programme, which was described by \"The Economist\" in 1989 as \"perhaps the most successful aid programme in Africa\".\n\nThe 1992 Land Acquisition Act was enacted to speed up the land reform process by removing the \"willing seller, willing buyer\" clause, limiting the size of farms and introducing a land tax (although the tax was never implemented.) The Act empowered the government to buy land compulsorily for redistribution, and a fair compensation was to be paid for land acquired. Landowners could challenge in court the price set by the acquiring authority. Opposition by landowners increased throughout the period of 1992 to 1997. In the 1990s, less than 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) were acquired, and fewer than 20,000 families were resettled. Much of the land acquired during what has become known as \"phase one\" of land reform was of poor quality, according to Human Rights Watch. Only 19 percent of the almost 3.5 million hectares (8.65 million acres) of resettled land was considered prime, or farmable.\n\nIn 1997, the new British government, led by Tony Blair, unilaterally stopped funding the \"willing buyer, willing seller\" land reform programme. Britain's ruling Labour Party felt no obligation to continue paying white farmers compensation.\n\nIn 2000, a referendum on constitutional amendments was held. The proposed amendments called for a \"fast track\" land reform and allowed the government to confiscate white-owned land for redistribution to black farmers without compensation. The motion failed with 55% of participants against the referendum. However, self-styled \"war veterans\", led by Chenjerai Hunzvi, began invading white-owned farms. Those who did not leave voluntarily were often tortured and sometimes killed. On 6 April 2000, Parliament pushed through an amendment, taken word for word from the draft constitution that was rejected by voters, allowing the seizure of white-owned farmlands without due reimbursement or payment. In this first wave of farm invasions, a total of 110,000 square kilometres of land had been seized.\n\nParliament, dominated by Zanu-PF, passed a constitutional amendment, signed into law on 12 September 2005, that nationalised farmland acquired through the \"Fast Track\" process and deprived original landowners of the right to challenge in court the government's decision to expropriate their land. The Supreme Court of Zimbabwe ruled against legal challenges to this amendment.\n\nDuring the \"fast track\", many parcels of land came under the control of people close to the government, as is the case throughout Africa. The several forms of forcible change in management caused a severe drop in production and other economic disruptions.\n\nA land reform was carried out as part of Prince Edward Island's agreement to join the Canadian Confederation in 1873. Most of the land was owned by absentee landlords in England, and as part of the deal Canada was to buy all the land and give it to the farmers.\n\nFollowing the U.S. Civil War, many blacks and military officials considered land reform vital. The downfall of the Confederacy emancipated millions, but few former slaves had the means to exercise real autonomy. Land, even at depressed post-war prices, was difficult for African Americans to procure. At the same time, with southern wealth the result of centuries of forced labor, blacks nationwide called for property on the basis of just reparations. Politically, redistribution carried the support of Radical Republicans. But opposing any grants to blacks were southern Democrats, along with a White House committed to 'restoration'. Given national divisions, reform efforts were varied but short-lived.\n\nMany African Americans believed property was critical to erasing slave-oriented social order. In addition to speaking out, some demanded plots and moved into their master’s plantation homes by force. Others bought land collectively, or squatted on what was undeveloped. Throughout war and Reconstruction, the presence of Federal troops provided a platform for agricultural policy. In 1865, William Tecumseh Sherman issued Field Order 15, taking coastal land in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, and dividing it into 40-acre plots for black settlement, hence the term \"40 acres and a mule\".\n\nIn March, Congress established the Freedmen’s Bureau, whose commissioner had authority to redistribute confiscated or abandoned southern land. The Bureau held , and key directors pushed for its settling with former slaves. When President Andrew Johnson began to pardon Confederates and restore their property, Commissioner Oliver O. Howard issued Circular 13. The order instructed agents to establish 40-acre parcels with haste. Johnson rescinded the order, and an overwhelming majority of Bureau land returned to its previous owners.\n\nThe final reform attempts of Reconstruction occurred within state governments. In South Carolina, a land commission was established, which purchased property and sold it on long-term credit. Other state Republicans utilized new tax systems, penalizing large estates, to seize and divide land and stimulate black ownership. This indirect method achieved little, as taxes were repaid and lands were reclaimed. Of property not redeemed, much was exploited by investors.\n\nUltimately, Reconstruction was discounted as 'Socialism' by moderates committed to free-market transformation, a popular new line of political attack levied against the likes of Boss Tweed and Benjamin F. Butler alike. Radicals began to fall even earlier, with the failure of Johnson’s impeachment. Liberal Republicans, eroding the era's political landscape, called for an immediate end to “black barbarism”. White supremacist violence and financial panic weakened Reconstruction to the breaking point. With the Compromise of 1877, it was finished.\n\nIn the 19th century, Indian tribes owned about 138 million acres (560,000 km) of land in the USA. Land was considered the property of the whole tribe, which used it to cater to the needs of the individual tribe members. This approach to land ownership was different than the white European approach, which regarded land as private property of individuals.\n\nMany US politicians believed it was important to assimilate Native Americans into white American culture, and thus have their lands open for commerce and development. The Dawes Act (also known as the General Allotment Act or the Dawes Severalty Act), adopted by Congress in 1887, authorized the President of the United States to survey American Indian tribal land and divide it into allotments for individual Indians. Those who accepted allotments and lived separately from the tribe would be granted United States citizenship. The Dawes Act was amended in 1891, and again in 1906 by the Burke Act.\n\nThrough the Dawes Act, many Indians received private title to a land-plot, but most of the Indian lands were considered \"surplus\", and put to sale to white European settlers. Thus, the total amount of land owned by Indians decreased to only 48 million acres (190,000 km) in 1934.\n\nMost tribal land still owned by ethnic Indians was recollectivized in 1934.\n\nAfghanistan has had a couple of attempts at land reform.\n\nIn 1975, the government of president Mohammad Daoud Khan responded to the inequities of the existing land tenure conditions by issuing a Land Reform Law. It limited individual holdings to a maximum of 20 hectares of irrigated, double-cropped land. Larger holdings were allowed for less productive land. The government was to expropriate all surplus land and pay compensation. To prevent the proliferation of small, uneconomic holdings, priority for redistributed lands was to be given to neighboring farmers with two hectares or less. Landless sharecroppers, laborers, tenants, and nomads had next priority. Despite the government's rhetorical commitment to land reform, the program was quickly postponed. Because the government's landholding limits applied to families, not individuals, wealthy families avoided expropriation by dividing their lands nominally between family members. The high ceilings for landholdings restricted the amount of land actually subject to redistribution. Finally, the government lacked the technical data and organizational bodies to pursue the program after it was announced.\n\nAfter the 1978 Saur Revolution, the communist Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) issued Decree No. 6, which canceled gerau and other mortgage debts of agricultural laborers, tenants, and small landowners with less than two hectares of land. The cancellation applied only to debts contracted before 1973. The Decree No. 8 of November 1978 made new landholdings from the 20 hectares of prime irrigated land in the 1975 law to just six hectares. It divided all land into seven classes and again allowed for larger holdings of less productive land. There was no compensation for government-expropriated surplus land and it established categories of farmers who had priority for redistributed land; sharecroppers already working on the land had highest priority.\n\nSince the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, China has been through a series of land reform programs. The founder of the Nationalist Party, Sun Yat-sen, advocated a \"land to the tiller\" program of equal distribution of land. which was partly implemented by the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-shek. In the 1940s, the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, funded with American money, with the support of the national government, carried out land reform and community action programs in several provinces.\n\nIn October 1947, two years before the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Communist Party of China launched land reform campaigns that established control in North China villages.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, a second land reform during the Great Leap Forward compelled individual farmers to join collectives, which, in turn, were grouped into People's communes with centrally controlled property rights and an egalitarian principle of distribution. This policy was generally a failure in terms of production. The PRC reversed this policy in 1962 through the proclamation of the Sixty Articles. As a result, the ownership of the basic means of production was divided into three levels with collective land ownership vested in the production team (see also Ho [2001]).\n\nA third land reform beginning in the late 1970s re-introduced the family-based contract system known as the Household Responsibility System, was followed by a period of stagnation. Chen, Wang, and Davis [1998] suggest that the stagnation was due, in part, to a system of periodic redistributions that encouraged over-exploitation rather than private capital investment in future productivity. However, although land use rights were returned to individual farmers, collective land ownership was left undefined after the disbandment of the People's Communes.\n\nSince 1983, China has launched a series of land policy reforms to improve land-use efficiency, to rationalize land allocation, to enhance land management, and to coordinate urban and rural development. These land policy reforms have yielded positive impacts on urban land use as well as negative socioeconomic consequences. On the positive side, they have contributed to emerging land markets, increased government revenue for the financing of massive infrastructure projects and provision of public goods, and improved the rationalization of land use. On the negative side, problems such as loss of social equity, socioeconomic conflicts, and government corruption have emerged.\n\nSince 1998 China is in the midst of drafting the new Property Law which is the first piece of national legislation that will define the land ownership structure in China for years to come. The Property Law forms the basis for China's future land policy of establishing a system of freehold, rather than of private ownership (see also Ho, [2005]).\n\nUnder the British occupation, the land system in India has been feudalic, with few absentee landlords holding most of the lands and claiming high rents from poor peasants. The demand for a land reform was a major theme in the demand for independence. After independence, the different states in India gradually started a land reform process in four main categories: abolition of intermediaries (rent collectors under the pre-Independence land revenue system); tenancy regulation (to improve the contractual terms including security of tenure); a ceiling on landholdings (to redistribute surplus land to the landless); and attempts to consolidate disparate landholdings. The extent and success of these reforms varied greatly between the different states of India.\n\nThe first land reform in recent history, called the Land Tax Reform or , passed in 1873, six years after the Meiji Restoration. It established the right of private land ownership in Japan for the first time and was a major restructuring of the previous land taxation system.\n\nThe government initially ordered individual farmers to measure the plots of their land themselves, calculate their taxes, and submit the results to local tax officials. However, difficulties arose with the honesty of the measuring system and the government responded by forcefully changing land values to meet the set amount if self-reported values did not meet projected values. This caused widespread resentment among farmers and several large-scale riots, causing the government to lower the tax rate from 3% to 2.5%. The department continued its aggressive taxation until 1878, but the strictness of rules gradually decreased as it became clear that required amounts would be met. By 1880, seven years after the start of the land reforms, the new system had been completely implemented.\n\nPrivate land ownership was recognized for the first time in Japan with the issuing of land titles. Previously, individual farmers were merely borrowing the land from feudal lords, who in turn were borrowing the land from the emperor. The reform abolished this archaic system of land ownership, and began to allow landowners to use their property as a financial asset in collateral or other investment. This law was one of the first steps towards the development of capitalism in Japan, paralleling the English (and later United Kingdom) statute Quia Emptores enacted several centuries earlier.\n\nAnother major land reform was carried out in 1947, during the occupied era after World War II, under instructions of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers based on a proposal from the Japanese government which had been prepared before the defeat of the Greater Japanese Empire. This last reform is also called .\n\nBetween 1947 and 1949, approximately of land (approximately 38% of Japan's cultivated land) was purchased from the landlords under the reform program and re-sold at extremely low prices (after inflation) to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, three million peasants had acquired land, dismantling a power structure that the landlords had long dominated.\n\nDuring the Macapagal administration in the early 1960s, a limited land reform program was initiated in Central Luzon covering rice fields.\n\nDuring the martial law era of the Ferdinand Marcos Administration, Presidential Decree 27 instituted a land reform program covering rice and corn farms. Rice and corn production under this land reform program was heavily supported by the Marcos Administration with land distribution and financing program known as the Masagana 99 and other production loans that led to increased rice and corn production. The country produced enough rice for local consumption and became a rice exporter during that period.\n\nThe Corazon Aquino Administration in the mid-1980s instituted a very controversial land reform known as CARP, which covered all agricultural lands. The program led to rice shortages in the succeeding years and lasted for 20 years without accomplishing the goal of land distribution. The program caused entrepreneurs to stay away from agriculture and a number of productive farmers left the farming sector. The CARP was a monumental failure in terms of cost to the government and the landowners whose lands were subjective to legal landgrabbing by the government. CARP expired at the end of December 2008.\n\nIn 1972, the Government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike, through the Land Reform Law, imposed a ceiling of twenty hectares on privately owned land and sought to distribute lands in excess of the ceiling for the benefit of landless peasants. Both land owned by public companies and paddy lands under ten hectares in extent were exempted from this ceiling. Between 1972 and 1974, the Land Reform Commission took over nearly 228,000 hectares. In 1975 the Land Reform (Amendment) Law brought over 169,000 hectares of plantations owned by companies (including British-owned companies) under state control.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1950, United States and South Korean authorities carried out a land reform that retained the institution of private property. They confiscated and redistributed all land held by the Japanese colonial government, Japanese companies, and individual Japanese colonists. The Korean government carried out a reform whereby Koreans with large landholdings were obliged to divest most of their land. A new class of independent, family proprietors was created.\n\nIn the 1950s, after the Nationalist government came to Taiwan, land reform and community development was carried out by the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction. This course of action was made attractive, in part, by the fact that many of the large landowners were Japanese who had fled, and the other large landowners were compensated with Japanese commercial and industrial properties seized after Taiwan reverted from Japanese rule in 1945. The land program succeeded also because the Kuomintang were mostly from the mainland and had few ties to the remaining indigenous landowners. See also: Taiwan Land Reform Museum\n\nIn the years after World War II, land redistribution to poor and landless peasants was initiated by the communist Viet Minh insurgents in areas which they controlled. After the partition of the country into two parts (North Vietnam and South Vietnam), the communist land reform (1953–1956) redistributed land to more than 2 million poor peasants, but at a cost of thousands, possibly tens of thousands of lives and contributed to the exodus of up to 1 million people from the North to the South in 1954 and 1955.. The land reform campaign was accompanied by large-scale repression and excesses. some of which were subsequently criticized within the ruling Workers Party of Vietnam itself.\n\nSouth Vietnam made several further attempts in the post-Diem years, the most ambitious being the Land to the Tiller program instituted in 1970 by President Nguyen Van Thieu. This limited individuals to 15 hectares, compensated the owners of expropriated tracts, and extended legal title to peasants who in areas under control of the South Vietnamese government to whom had land had previously been distributed by the Viet Cong.\n\nThe following table summarizes many land reforms that are not mentioned in this page.

Completed in 997, the work had originally been entitled \"Longkan Shoujing\" (龍龕手鏡 [鑒 and 鏡 are synonyms]), but had its title changed owing to naming taboo when it was later printed by the Song publishers. (Emperor Taizu's grandfather had the name 敬, a homophone of 鏡.) The earliest surviving edition of the work is an incomplete Korean one, reprinted in China in 1985.\n\n\"Longkan Shoujian\" was one of the many Buddhist \"yinyishu\" (音義書 \"dictionary of pronunciations and meanings\") produced in ancient China, which were meant to aid the study of Buddhist scriptures. However, the work stands out in two aspects. Firstly, its method of collation is innovative. While Chinese dictionaries before \"Shoujian\" collate characters either graphically (by radical) or phonetically (by tone and rime), the work employs both methods: the radicals, which number 242 (including the \"radical\" \"zai\" (雜 \"miscellaneous\"), where are found characters difficult to be analyzed graphically), are grouped by tone into four groups (each group occupies one \"juan\" (卷) or fascicle); the characters under each radical are in turn grouped by tone. Secondly, it collects more than 26,000 characters with a huge proportion of variant characters. Many of these variants are not recorded in any other works.\n\nThe characters in it are divided, in terms of orthography, into \"standard\" (正 \"zheng\"), \"vulgar\" (俗 \"su\"), \"contemporary\" (今 \"jin\"), \"archaic\" (古 \"gu\") and \"alternative\" (或作 \"huozuo\"), a classification more elaborated than that used in \"Ganlu Zishu\". The pronunciations of characters in it are indicated by either homophone or \"fanqie\" spelling. For some characters, only the pronunciations are given, not the meanings.\n\nWhile being criticized for its unorthodox collation and collection by the Qing philologists, it is hailed by Pan (1980) as an essential guide for deciphering the Dunhuang manuscripts, which contains a large amount of \"vulgar\" characters.\n\n\n"}

She was a Croatian medievalist of the 20th century. A substantial part of the work was devoted to criticism of medieval sources.\n\nNada Klaić was born in Zagreb, the granddaughter of the historian Vjekoslav Klaić and sister of landscape architect Smiljan Klaić. She was a university professor and a prominent Croatian medievalist, graduated at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Zagreb, the same faculty where she was involved in teaching for 45 years. She started her teaching and scientific career at the Faculty's Department of History in 1943, to become a full professor of the Croatian medieval history in 1969. This position she held until her death in 1988.\n\nSince 1946, when she took her doctor's degree with the thesis \"Političko i društveno uređenje Slavonije za Arpadovića\" (Political and Social Organization of Slavonia under the Árpád dynasty), she spent several decades engaged in researching Croatian medieval history. Nada Klaić gathered the results of her extensive analytical investigations, published first in journals and proceedings, and monographs and surveys of Croatian history.\n\nShe researched the period from the arrival of the Slavs (see Migration Period) until the 19th century. Under the early influence of M. Barada, Lj. Hauptmann, B. Grafenauer and J. Šidak, she contributed to the Croatian Medievalism by writing papers about social history. The book \"History of the Yugoslav Peoples II\" (1959) includes her comprehensive overview of the history of Croatia in the Early Modern Times, including elements of economic and social history.\n\nShe paid special attention to the history of cities, as shown by several studies and books: \"Zadar in the Middle Ages until 1409\" (with Ivo Petricioli, 1976), \"Zagreb in the Middle Ages\" (1982), \"Notes on Vukovar in the Middle Ages\" (1983), \"Trogir in the Middle Ages: Public Life of the City and its Inhabitants\" (1985), \"Koprivnica in the Middle Ages\" (1987).\n\nShe authored numerous works regarding revolts and social conflicts, which she collected in the book \"Social Turmoil and Revolts in Croatia in the 16th and 17th Centuries\" (1976). She described the role of specific nobles in the books \"The Last Dukes of Celje in the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen\" (1982) and \"Medvedgrad and its Masters\" (1987).\n\nMuch of her work is the analysis and publication of historical sources. Relying partly on the contributions of earlier historians, she analyzed the entire Croatian diplomatic material of the Early Middle Ages (\"Diplomatic Analysis of the Documents from the Age of Croatian Rulers of Croat Descent\", 1965, 1966–67), questioning its authenticity. Along with the anonymous Split chronicle called \"Historia Salonitana maior\" (1967), Klaić published several sources translated from Latin for the needs of students (\"Sources for Croatian History before 1526\", 1972). \n\nShe provided a comprehensive and original concept of the early medieval development of the Croatian lands in the book \"History of the Croats in the Early Middle Ages\" (1971), while she collected her writings about numerous problems of the later period in the book \"History of the Croats in the High Middle Ages\" (1976). Her posthumously published books are \"Medieval Bosnia: Political Status of Bosnian Rulers before the Coronation of Tvrtko in 1377\" (1989) and \"History of the Croats in the Middle Ages\" (1990).\n\nKlaić was one of the most prominent Croatian and Yugoslavian medievalist in the 20th century. Some of her achievements are the innovative and modern approach to Croatian history (especially for the Middle Ages), which helped release it from the romantic nationalism of the 19th century, and the revaluation of older historical sources. However, a substantial portion of her views and conclusions are controversial and the work provoked strong reactions in historiography. For example, that the document Pacta conventa is a forgery probably made in the 14th century, her \"lack of opinion\" over the matter of 1102 in a 1959 article disputing Croatian writer Oleg Mandić's earlier work on the matter, and her view on the Croatian migration and old homeland in the 7th century, as well other topics of the early Croatian history. \n\nKlaić was highly critical about the work by some scholars like Ferdo Šišić (which she dismissed as poorly analysed), or Lj. Hauptmann (regarding the thesis of Croats migration from White Croatia and the Iranian-Caucasian theory of the origin of early Croats). Her firm assumptions on the origin and early homeland of Croats based on Margetić's thesis whereby the Croats arrived to Dalmatia in the late 8th or early 9th century, although Margetić emphasized it was only an assumption, which he later reportedly rejected. The German and Austrian scholars H. Kunstmann, J. Herrmann, R. Werner and O. Kronsteiner loose considerations on Slavs were especially influential on her viewpoints.\n\nKlaić posited that there was no Slavic migration from North to South, but rather from South to North, as the Slavs were indigenous to the Balkan, therefore was no migration of the so-called White Croats from the White Croatia in Carantania. She supported the thesis by H. Kunstmann that Slavs did not have their own tribal names, and their names should be traced to the Illyrian, Greek and Byzantine cultural milieu. She believed the Croats were Slavs in the Avar Khaganate ruled by the Avars, and as such firmly considered that Croatian state organization and titles župan and ban were of Avar origin. She thought the discovered graves which dated from before the 9th century belonged to the Avars, not Croats, and that the Avars lived in Dalmatia.\n\nThis and other views, such as the Gothic administrative origin of Liburnia and the existence of Avarian \"županijska Liburnia\", \"banska Liburnia\" and \"županijska Istria\", as well her constant consideration of incompetence of the archaeologists in the absence of proof for her theories, were criticized and dismissed by modern scholars like N. Budak and P. Štih as lacking bases in reliable evidence and sources. Miroslav Brandt criticised Klaić as a protégé of socialist Yugoslavia in her approach to Croatian historiography.\n\nPublished posthumously:\n\nFrom Latin to Croatian:\n\n\n"}

He was a writer and perhaps the greatest Serbian expert on church law and the Slavic world.. As a canon lawyer in Dalmatia, he defended the Serbian Orthodox Church against the State. He was a polyglot, fluent in German, Italian, Latin, Russian, Greek, and Old Slavonic, and an author of numerous books.\n\nBishop Nikodim Milaš was born at Šibenik in Dalmatia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) on 4 April 1845 to Trifun and Maria Milaš (Serbian father and Italian mother). He was baptized Nikola. After attending the Jesuit Gymnasium in Zadar and graduating from the Serbian Orthodox Theological School at Sremski Karlovci, he studied at the oldest college of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Kievan Theological Academy and Seminary (then part of Imperial Russia), and in 1871 took a master's degree in Canon Law and Church History, the fruit of which, his remarkable dissertation, \"Nomocanon of Patriarch Photius\", brought him the golden cross of the Russian Orthodox Church. Upon his return home, Serbian Orthodox Bishop Stefan (Knežević) of Dalmatia appointed him professor of canon law at Zadar's Theological Orthodox Institute. In 1872, he published a study in which he criticized the Austro-Hungarian government for interfering in the life of the Serbian Orthodox Church and its faithful.\n\nProfessor Nikola Milaš was tonsured in 1873 and given the monastic name of Nikodim. Also, he was ordained deacon, and two years later, presbyter. He received the rank archimandrite in 1880. Under his administration the theological institute in Zadar became one of the best Orthodox schools. Nikodim corresponded with the greatest Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic canonists at the time: Alexis Stepanovich Pavloff (d. 1898), Alexander Theodorovich Lavroff, Vasili Vasilievich Bolotoff, Pietro Gasparri, Emil Albert Friedberg, Joseph Putzer, Friedrich Heinrich Vering. After the publication of his (hornbook), \"\"Principles of Jurisdiction in the Eastern Orthodox Church,\" in which he again levelled criticism on the Austro-Hungarian authorities, he was forced to take refuge in Belgrade in late 1885. There for the next two years, he was the rector of the Belgrade Seminary (\"Bogoslovija\"). In early 1888 he was back in Zadar where he completed that same year two major works: \"Roman Catholic Propaganda: its foundation and rules today\" (1889) and his six-volume treatise on the Serbian Orthodox Church entitled \"Orthodox Church and Canon Law\" (1890). He liked Zadar, and the people would habe been glad to keep him; but the attraction of a Belgrade post carried him back there in the autumn of 1888. He was appointed Professor of Canon law and Church History at the Belgrade's Grande école (\"Velika škola\") and Bogoslovija (Theological Seminary). Two years later, when Bishop Stefan Knezević of Dalmatia died, Nikodim was elected Bishop of Dalmatia on 10 July 1890 and consecrated on 16 September 1890. Throughout his tenure he was under pressure from anti-Serb Orthodox authorities and forced to endure aggressive Roman Catholic proselytism. Bishop Nikodim collaborated with politician Sava Bjelanović during that difficult period. He once wrote:\n\n\"Nije lak posao vladici u Dalmaciji i sa takozvanom pravoslavnom inteligencijom. Ovi i ovakvi ljudi prinudili su dalmatinske episkope Rajačića, Živkovića i Mutibarića da bježe iz Dalmacije u druge eparhije. ... Ali najteže je dalmatinskom episkopu sa Vladom, ako hoće da bude pravi pravoslavni episkop i čuvar vjere i crkve svoje. U Austriji od 1868. vlada zakon da pravoslavlje uživa jednaka prava kao i sve ostale priznate državne konfesije. Ali u samoj stvari ta je crkva u Austriji samo tolerirana.\"\"\n\n\"The bishop's job in Dalmatia is not an easy one and with a so-called Orthodox intelligentsia (many of whom were Roman Catholic, though declared themselves as Serbs). Those and like folk have caused Dalmatian bishops such as Josif Rajačić, Pantelejmon Živković and Jerotije Mutibarić to flee from Dalmatia and seek refuge in other diocese... But what is really difficult for a bishop is to deal with State officials, if he wants to be a true Orthodox bishop and defender of his faith and church. In Austria there is a rule since 1868 that Orthodoxy has the same position as all other confessions in the State. But the truth of the matter is that the Church (Orthodox) is just tolerated.\"\n\nIn 1901 Nikodim published \"\"Orthodoxy in Dalmatia\" in answer to a papal encyclical in which Pope Leo XIII appealed for union. His book was criticized by the bishop of the Eparchy of Križevci, who wrote:\n\n\"Nobody hates Union as much as Orthodox Dalmatians (meaning Serbs).\"\n\nNikodim also had problems with his superiors. He refused elevation to the Holy Synod (the executive body of the Serbian Orthodox Church) of Belgrade and later of Sarajevo because he was not elected according to canon law. Always under constant pressure from civil authorities and other enemies, Nikodim was forced to retire in early 1912. He was succeeded by Bishop Dimitrije Branković.\n\nBishop Nikodim died at Dubrovnik on 12 April 1915. The only copy of his new book -- \"The Church and the State in the Austro-Hungarian Empire\"\"—has since disappeared.\n\nNikodim Milaš grew up in a region where jurisprudence was founded on Roman and Byzantine law. His extensive and exact legal erudition, and the skill with which he wrote about the complex canonical laws, soon brought him a reputation never before equalled, and caused him to be universally recognized as the greatest Eastern Orthodox canon lawyer of his day. Most of his work was translated into Russian, German, Romanian, Bulgarian and Greek, and has greatly influenced modern Orthodox canonists, including I. Bogović, C. Metrović, Professor S. Troitsky (the Russian-Serbian canonist), Branko Cisarž (d. 1982), and Dimsho Perić (d. 2007), who wrote studies on the history of church-state relations in Serbia. Nikodim produced a number of collections of canonical texts, and was particularly interested in the churches of North Africa in the Roman period. He translated \"The Constitution (Syntagma) of the Divine and Sacred Canons\" by Rallis and Potlis, and placed his commentaries in the context of previous Biblical hermeneutic works. He had a good deal to say about Church-State relations, a subject which preoccupied most of his life.\n\nHe is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58446191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58446191", "title": "Paleoradiology", "text": "Paleoradiology\n\nPaleoradiology (ancient radiology) is the study of archaeological remains through the use of radiographic techniques, such as X-ray, CT (computer tomography) and micro-CT scans. It is predominately used by archaeologists and anthropologists to examine mummified remains due to its non-invasive nature. Paleoradiologists can discover post-mortem damage to the body, or any artefacts buried with them, while still keeping the remains intact. Radiological images can also contribute evidence about the person's life, such as their age and cause of death. The first recorded use of paleoradiology (although not by that name) was in 1896, just a year after the Rōntgen radiograph was first produced. Although this method of viewing ancient remains is advantageous due to its non-invasive manner, many radiologists lack expertise in archeology and very few radiologists can identify ancient diseases which may be present.\n\nCT scans are most commonly used in paleoradiological studies because they can create images of soft tissue, organs and body cavities of mummified remains without performing an invasive and damaging autopsy. This enables archaeologists and anthropologists to digitally unwrap the remains and reveal what they contain. CT scanners create these images by taking multiple radiographic planes (or cuts) of the body at different angles which records the layers of different structures in the remains. This differs from typical radiographic scans (X-rays) where all the structural layers are documented in one image, which can create shadows and therefore limit their accuracy.\n\nThere are several main viewing techniques used in CT imaging.\n\nAfter these different views of the remains have been obtained, it is possible to create a three-dimensional reconstruction of the body. This brings into focus details which may have been missed on the axial imagining. Algorithm manipulation is used to create the rotational 3D images. In paleoradiology, the 3D images provide a greater understanding of the remains themselves. For example, in 2002, a study of nine Egyptian mummies found that by using the 3D reconstructions they could see the preservation of soft tissues, such as the penis on one male body and braided hair on female remains. The 3D modelling also illustrated discrepancies between the remains, as some had their internal organs removed while others had not. \n\nDue to their ability to take multiple planes of the remains, CT scans are able to virtually 'fly through' the body to assess internal composition and cavities. These techniques are commonly used for diagnostic scans such as colonoscopy and bronchoscopy, and the same method is applied to ancient remains. This enables researchers to digitally look through the remains from the top down, as though they were watching a short video of footage from the interior of the body. The technique presents observable data from the hollow cavities in the chest and abdomen regions. It can demonstrate whether there are internal organs present or if, in the case of Egyptian mummies, linen has been packed to maintain the body shape of the remains.\n\nMicro-CT is a specialised form of CT scan used to create images with pixels in micrometres. These images are frequently used for bone density examinations and produce greater detail for images of bony structures. This radiology technique is often used to examine the teeth from mummified remains.\n\nRadiographs, or X-rays, have been used to study and observe ancient remains since their invention by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895. This early form of X-ray, sometimes known as Röntgenograms, was immediately used by physicists, anthropologists, anatomists and archaeologists as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCT scans are the most common radiological technique used in modern archaeology due to their ability to provide more detailed information about ancient remains (such as soft tissue and blood vessels) and to produce 3D images by taking layers of different angled pictures. Archaeologists are able to collect data such as age, sex, the cause of death, socioeconomic status, mummification and burial practices by analysing the CT images. The images can also reveal whether the remains were subject to ancient diseases or post-mortem damage. Although paleoradiology practices are used on preserved remains such as European bog bodies and frozen bodies from the High Andes, they are more frequently documented in the analysis of Egyptian mummified remains.\n\nCT scans are used in Egyptology to gain insight into mummified bodies without risking damage to the integrity of the remains. Hoffman's recent study of nine Egyptian remains discovered new information regarding the mummification practices of Egyptians. The typical process of mummification, as written by Herodotus, involves the removal of the four major internal organs (liver, intestines, lungs and stomach) and placement of them in four canopic jars. The heart is removed, embalmed and placed back into the body as it is an important feature in the journey to the Egyptian afterlife. However, Hoffman discovered that this was not the case in all mummies. Through analysis of CT-produced 3D images, the \"fly-through\" technique and a combination of axial and coronal images, it was discovered that four of the remains had not had their internal organs removed and in another four the heart could not be identified. Hoffman suggests this may be due to socioeconomic differences between the mummies during the time they were alive. CT scans were further used in Hoffman's study to potentially identify one of the remains as Ramesses I, a Pharaoh during New Kingdom Egypt. It was found that the mummification practices of this particular body were in conjunction with those typically used during the New Kingdom period, as images showed rolled linen placed inside the body in order to preserve its shape. The mummy's arms were also found to be placed across the chest as a symbol of nobility.\n\nImaging done by Rethy Chhem, in 2004, was able to correct a diagnosis of Ramesses II from X-rays done in 1976. The incorrect diagnosis had been of ankylosing spondylitis, a form of arthritis. However, Chhem perceived that the pharaoh actually had diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, a calcification of the joints causing ligaments to attach to the spine. The CT images provided a clearer and more detailed image of the spine when compared with the early X-rays. This enabled the researchers to provide a greater insight into diseases found in ancient remains and achieve a more accurate diagnosis. \n\nA recent CT scan of Tutankhamun in 2006 was able to provide evidence against the 'homicide theory'. A depression fracture noted on the skull from X-rays taken 30 years previously was found to be a post-mortem injury rather than a cause of death. The hole in the head had been created in order to continue the embalming process of mummification. This CT investigation was also able to confirm Tutankhamun's age of death as nineteen and disprove the idea that the young pharaoh had suffered from scoliosis; rather the bend in his spine was from additional post-mortem damage to the body. \n\nAlthough the information and evidence gathered by radiological imaging of ancient remains have been largely beneficial to the fields of archaeology and anthropology, not all of the information can be considered accurate due to the lack of radiologists who specialise in paleopathology. Instead, to obtain the most information from CT or X-ray images a team must meet to discuss the findings (e.g. for a skeletal study of the remains, an orthopaedic surgeon, bone pathologist and musculoskeletal radiologist would meet). Another disadvantage to this technique is the low contrast resolution. The researcher may be unable to determine a difference between soft tissue and artefacts left from the embalming process. Due to the decomposed state of some of the mummified remains, it can also be difficult to distinguish internal organs due to shrinkage and a lack of preservation. Post-mortem injuries and damage to the body can also hinder the ability of radiological scans to provide accurate information for researchers. For example, in frozen remains, there can difficulty when differentiating whether a CT suggests the body has air-inflated lung tissue or if there is frozen fluid in the lungs. \n\nPaleoradiology is informative in its ability to assist in determining the age of death of the remains, however, this is not always completely accurate or available information. In a sample of bog bodies, 35% were not able to be identified with any age group and 30% could not be sex determined. A radiological study of an iceman was only able to produce an estimate of 40–50 years at age of death. In order to achieve a more accurate time frame, the body would have to be subject to an autopsy or similar physical assessment which would cause irreversible damage to the remains.\n\nAnother disadvantage of paleoradiology is the difficulty in transporting the equipment or the artefact/remains to spaces where the images can be taken. For example, in 2005 the mummy of Tutankhamun was imaged using a CT-scanner which had to be brought from the Cairo Museum to tomb KV62 in the Valley of the Kings. This was due to the fragile state of the remains which were unable to be removed from the climate-controlled tomb. In this study, funding came from a five-year grant from the Supreme Council of Antiquities, which was aided by the donation of a Siemens CT-scanner by the National Geographic Society, however typically funding for research can be problematic as equipment is costly and there may not be sufficient interest to prompt donations.\n"}

The protagonist is the primary agent propelling the story forward, and is often the character who faces the most significant obstacles. If a story contains a subplot, or is a narrative made up of several stories, then each subplot may have its own protagonist.\n\nThe protagonist is the character whose fate is most closely followed by the reader or audience, and who is opposed by the antagonist. The antagonist will provide obstacles and complications and create conflicts that test the protagonist, thus revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist's character.\n\nThe earliest known examples of a protagonist are found in Ancient Greece. At first, dramatic performances involved merely dancing and recitation by the chorus. Then in \"Poetics\", Aristotle describes how a poet named Thespis introduced the idea of one actor stepping out and engage in a dialogue with the chorus. This was the invention of tragedy, and occurred about 536 B.C. Then the poet Aeschylus, in his plays, introduced a second actor, inventing the idea of dialogue between two characters. Sophocles then wrote plays that included a third actor.\n\nA description of the protagonist's origin cited that during the early period of Greek drama, the protagonist served as the author, the director, and the actor and that these roles were only separated and allocated to different individuals later. There is also a claim that the poet did not assign or create the protagonist as well as other terms for actors such as \"deuteragonist\" and \"tritagonist\" primarily because he only gave actors their appropriate part. However, these actors were assigned their specific areas at the stage with the protagonist always entering from the middle door or that the dwelling of the \"deuteragonist\" (second most important character) should be on the right hand, and the \"tritagonist\" (third most important character), the left.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, the protagonist is distinguished from the term \"hero\", which was used to refer to a human who became a semi-divine being. in the narrative.\n\nEuripides' play \"Hippolytus\" may be considered to have two protagonists. Phaedra is the protagonist of the first half, who dies partway through the play. Her stepson, the titular Hippolytus, assumes the dominant role in the second half of the play.\n\nIn Ibsen’s play \"The Master Builder\", the protagonist is the architect Halvard Solness. The young woman, Hilda Wangel, whose actions lead to the death of Solness, is the antagonist.\n\nIn Shakespeare’s play \"Romeo and Juliet\", Romeo is the protagonist. He is actively in pursuit of his relationship with Juliet, and the audience is invested in that story. Tybalt, as an antagonist, opposes Romeo and attempts to thwart the relationship.\n\nIn Shakespeare’s play \"Hamlet\", Prince Hamlet, who seeks revenge for the murder of his father, is the protagonist. The antagonist would be the character who most opposes Hamlet, Claudius (though, in many ways, Hamlet is his own antagonist).\n\nSometimes, a work will have a false protagonist, who may seem to be the protagonist, but then may disappear unexpectedly. The character Marion in Alfred Hitchcock's film \"Psycho\" (1960) is an example.\n\nA novel that contains a number of narratives may have a number of protagonists. Alexander Solzhenitsyn's \"The First Circle\", for example, depicts a variety of characters imprisoned and living in a gulag camp. Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", depicts fifteen major characters involved in or affected by a war.\n\n\"Little Women\" boasts a cast of over five diverse females struggling with the inevitability of the crossing between childhood and womenhood.\n\nIn Charlotte Brontë's novel \"Jane Eyre\", Jane's spiritual and emotional growth captivate the social criticism of its day, exploring heavy subjects such as classism, sexuality, religion, and proto-feminism during the early 1800s.\n\nIn Peter and Wendy, \"Wendy Darling\" is the protagonist.\n\nIn some cases, the protagonist is not a human: in Richard Adams' novel \"Watership Down,\" a group of anthropomorphised rabbits, led by the protagonist Hazel, escape their warren after seeing a vision of its destruction, starting a perilous journey to find a new home.\n"}

{"id": "8458031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8458031", "title": "Society for Creative Anachronism activities", "text": "Society for Creative Anachronism activities\n\nA basic requirement of a Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) event is that everyone wear clothing similar to that worn before 1601 AD. Within the SCA, the term for this type of period clothing is \"garb\", and there can be a very wide range in the time period, style and level of authenticity. Members often have \"field\" garb, simple cotton tunics or gowns that they wear to camping or other outdoor events, and \"court\" garb made of expensive brocades and silks that are reserved for formal events. Many SCA members make their own clothing, but can also purchase their garb from merchants or barter with other SCA members. Newcomers to the SCA can usually borrow garb for their first event or two by contacting the local group's Gold Key officer or Chatelaine/Castellan, who is responsible for helping acclimatize new members.\n\nThe SCA recreates three forms of martial activities, including \"heavy\" armoured combat, fencing and archery. Armoured combat focuses on recreating medieval tournament culture through courteous, chivalric displays of skill in practice, tournament and melee scenarios. SCA fencing employs a form of heavy rapier fencing built upon techniques outlined in German and Italian Renaissance era (15th-16th century) fencing manuals. Archery activities in the SCA include both target archery and combat archery, using equipment modified for safety in conjunction with armoured combat during melee scenarios.\n\nArmoured Combat (sometimes referred to as \"Heavy Combat\", \"Heavy List\", or \"Heavy Fighting\") using weapons fashioned to generally approximate the sword-and-shield, greatsword, spear, glaive and halberd of the High Middle Ages.\n\nFencing or Rapier Combat, generally approximating the lightly armored \"swashbuckling\" of the 15th century and the 16th century, emphasizing the rapier over cutting swords. Many members of the Society study and practice period manuals from the salons of Western Europe whose Sword Masters taught the \"Arte of Defence\", where the term \"fencing\" came from.\nCombat Archery using bows and crossbows has been a part of Society combat from the early days as well, and currently is highly regulated for safety concerns. It is not allowed in tournaments, but only in war or melee scenarios. The arrows used have specially designed tips and tails for safety, and the equipment has limits placed on how powerful it can be.\n\nThrown Weapons are also allowed in wars and melees. This can include javelins, knives, axes, throwing maces, and other weapons. A weapon must meet certain extra safety requirements (of weight and padding) to be allowed to be thrown.\n\nSiege Combat is the reproduction of large siege engines for use in wars and melees, such as the onager, ballista, and trebuchet. The engines are obviously scaled down in size and power and shoot safe ammunition such as tennis balls.\n\nThe martial arts as practiced in the SCA are notable in that there are no referees to declare a winner. \"Marshals\" are on the field to maintain safety (e.g. watch for loose or broken equipment or to protect bystanders). It is the combatants who acknowledge the effect of blows. A combatant is on his or her own honor to \"call\" a \"good shot\", feigning its effect. For example, a good blow to the arm renders that arm useless, so the combatant will stop using it for the duration of the fight. Calling a leg shot, the combatant drops to his or her knees.\n\nThe Armored Combat or \"Heavy Weapons Fighting\" forms practiced in the SCA roughly mirror those of medieval infantry, and both tournaments and battles are fought. The fighters wear armor (often of their own making) made of plastic, leather, or steel, or any combination thereof. \n\nAs a full-contact sport; moves are not planned or signaled and fighters strike each other with considerable force and speed. Weapons are primarily made of rattan to resemble swords, pikes, spears, axes and other medieval weapon types. Maces and axes have heads made of rubber or stiff foam, and pole weapons (resembling medieval pole-axes, glaives, halberds or bills, etc.) may or may not be required to be similarly padded, depending upon the regulations in a given SCA kingdom.\n\nFor the purposes of calling blows, all heavy-weapons combatants are considered to be armored in a chain mail hauberk, with an open-faced helmet with a nasal. For that reason, a draw cut or glancing blow would have no effect, while a solid blow would. (Mail protects well against a slicing blade; it transmits most of the force of a blow.) Good strikes to the torso and head are treated as a 'killing blow'.\n\nMost SCA fighters use a one-handed weapon in combination with a shield of some kind. With centuries of historical examples to draw upon, shields may range from large rectangular Roman-style \"scuta\" to small bucklers, with common styles including the \"kite\", center-grip (round or oval), and \"heater\" (so called because it resembles the shape of a flatiron). Other popular weapon choices include two-weapons (one in each hand) or two-handed weapons such as greatswords, glaives, or katana. Some Kingdoms are also starting to experiment with thrown weapons such as javelins and throwing axes for use in melees and battles.\n\nMost groups hold \"fighter practices\" where individual and group combat is practiced and informal instruction occurs, but in some areas there may be more formalized and structured training in a local style. Typically several years of direct experience in the SCA's Armored Combat are needed to excel in tournaments.\n\nSome weapons, while actively used within the SCA's target period, have been barred from use in SCA combat because it is difficult or impossible to make them safe. \n\nThese include punching weapons (Katar (कटार)), punch daggers and offensive shields such as the targe, and flexible weapons such as the flail or ball-and-chain, which can wrap around heads, limbs or shields to cause injury.\n\nRecreations of period firearms, no matter what the type of propulsion used, are banned from use on the Armored Combat field. This ban was put in place by the Board of Directors on January 16, 1999, on suggestion by the Society Earl Marshal at the time. The stated reason was that the appearance of firearms signaled the downfall of chivalric combat, which the SCA attempts to recreate, and therefore having said items on the field detracts from the experience.\n\nAll of these weapons have been banned by the Society at large, and therefore cannot be used within any Kingdom across the SCA.\n\nSCA fencing rules differ substantially from Olympic fencing rules. Instead of fencing for points, fencers attempt to 'disable' or 'kill' their opponent by striking at target areas. Rapier combatants are considered to be wearing street clothes and leather gloves, so both thrusts and cuts are accepted as attacks. SCA rules do not recognize lanes or right of way. Opponents fight \"in the round\". Body-to-body contact is prohibited, but hand-on-blade contact is allowed, so the off hand becomes an important factor. \n\nWhile many SCA members attempt to re-create rapier combat of the 16th and early 17th centuries, in practice it often becomes a blend of Society rules and modern fencing. Many rapier and smallsword enthusiasts study fencing manuals of the 15th and 16th centuries, and use rapier simulators made with schlaeger or bated rapier blades, rather than the more sport-oriented foil and épée blades. Some kingdoms are reviewing an experimental style called \"side-sword\", which allows percussive cuts and thrusts with blades suitable for cut-and-thrust style fencing.\n\nSome fencing melees allow some firearm simulation (rubber band guns) as well. This activity is not universally accepted within the Society.\n\nAll kingdoms except the Kingdom of Calontir now have organized fencing activities.\n\nCombat Archery allows the introduction of bows and crossbows to Heavy Weapons combat. Strict rules are in place to limit the launch force of field weapons and the projectiles are specially built with large blunted tips and special backs to minimize the risk of true injury. Consistent with other SCA combat, arrow strikes to shields are considered blocked, while strikes to armored areas of the body are not. Judging the effects of blows is left to the honor of the combatant struck. The current Society-wide rules for Combat Archery specify that missile strikes are judged just as any blow. That it is up to the fighter to determine if it hit them properly and with enough force. It is stated however that strikes from arrows, by their nature, will be with less force than that with a sword. Due to requirements of larger safety zones to protect spectators from ricochets and overshots, combat archery is usually limited to large melees. \n\nAll archers are considered to be exactly the same as any other Heavy Combatant (though historically this hasn't always been true). They are physically struck down to defeat them and they wear the same armor with the exception of the hands which can be more lightly armored half-gauntlets to be flexible enough to use their equipment. Do note however that as always any combatant on the field may yield to his opponent in lieu of being hit. Thus, many combat archers who have no other way to defend themselves will therefore yield when charged by another Heavy Combatant (instead of taking a blow from which they cannot defend themselves).\n\nIn some kingdoms, archers properly authorized, are allowed to carry melee weapons and to switch from bow/crossbow to the hand weapon. However they must properly retire their bow or crossbow before making the switch and meet safety requirements which protect any half-gauntleted hand (such as using a basket hilt).\n\nThrown weapons are used in melees when permitted. After the latest revision of the Marshal's Handbook basically any form of weapon can be made legal to be thrown. Essentially as long as the weapon weighs under 2 pounds, has every tip padded appropriately, and meets a few other guidelines, it is legal for being thrown. Also all thrown weapons can be used for striking or thrusting as well.\n\nSiege Weapons are some of the most impressive pieces of machinery on the battlefield. They are carefully designed within power guidelines to make sure that they cannot throw their ammo farther than 80 yards. Even at this level however there is much stored power in them and great care and training is required to use them properly and safely.\n\nThe \"bardic arts\" are also popular. The bard in pre-medieval Celtic society held a specific social class and had specific duties. In the SCA context, though, \"bard\" refers to most storytellers, poets, and musicians. \n\nSCA bards not only perform historical period pieces but often compose new period-style works, some of which are based on SCA culture. These may be in the style of ancient forms, such as a new version of a Child Ballad, or a piece recounting (in period style) some aspect of the \"Current Middle Ages\" such as a history of an SCA kingdom, a tribute to an individual, or an account of an event. \n\nOne crossover from science fiction fandom found in the SCA is \"filking.\" A filk is a new lyric set to an existing melody. This practice has ample historical antecedent; ancient musical codices are full of tropes that set new lyrics to existing tunes. For example, The Codex Carmina Burana is a collection of often-ribald lyrics set to the Gregorian chant tunes that were used in worship at the time. What sets filks apart is that the tunes are generally modern: Broadway show tunes, top-40 radio hits (going back to the 1960s when the SCA got its start), and so on. Filk has been used to teach novice members something about the organization's history (e.g., 'Imperium Compound,' versions of which were unique to each early kingdom and chronicled the reigns of the kings by the supposed foibles of each). SCA filksongs have also been used to protest Society policies or customs, with some success; for example, the famous 'Berzark Rag' protesting the use of excessive striking force advocated by the Society's Earl Marshal in the late 1960s resulted in his removal from office; and the strains of 'Causes of Rebellion' (aka 'Lie to the Council') by Astra of the Grey Shadows have stirred many a political tempest in their day. \n\nSometimes, awards are given for prowess in the Bardic Arts; though not as developed or common as the martial arts awards, bards prize this recognition by their peers. Kingdoms and principalities may have a College of Bards. These may be highly structured or very loosely organized. \n\nMany early music performers resist being categorized only as a \"bard,\" because they may have specific cultural interests and prefer to style themselves as minstrels, troubadours, trouvères, minnesingers, skalds, etc. \n\nA common bardic activity is the \"bardic circle,\" where performers take turns sharing pieces. Circles may be structured, with participants passing a token to indicate who has the floor, or they may be informal, with performers following each other in no set order. Some circles may have a theme. Feasts are another common venue for musicians to perform individually or in groups (i.e. consorts and plays). \n\nDuring camping events at night, bards may practice \"firewalking\" (also known as fyrewalking or fire-crawling), where a performer or small group travel from campsite to campsite offering entertainment or joining other bardic circles in progress. Generally, it is considered polite to welcome a new bard who enters an encampment to perform (harkening back to the days when traveling bards were mostly the only entertainment or news to be had). Besides the applause, bards may be offered drink, food or other refreshments for their performances.\n\nThe Equestrian Guilds promote the study, practice, demonstration, and teaching of equestrian-related activities in the Knowne World. The EQ Guilds encourage participation in games that are modeled on training techniques used by medieval armies, as well as a version of jousting. \n\nAt an equestrian event one may see riders competing in such games as: \n\nSome of these games are designed to teach the rider to control his/her mount and weapon while in a combat situation. Others simulate hunting from horseback. Riders who wish to participate must demonstrate their ability to control a horse at various gaits, and control a horse while holding a weapon. Riders start at the Beginner level riding at a walk, and then advance through intermediate (trot) and advanced (canter or gallop) when they have proven their abilities to the Equestrian marshallate.\n\nThe SCA maintains its own College of Arms to register and protect heraldic devices of its members (at least within the Society). \n\nFor the first three decades of the Society's existence, all heraldic device submissions had to be checked against extant SCA arms, heraldry taken from or alluding to works of fiction, and coats of arms granted to families alive or extinct. Following a major revision of the SCA's rules for heraldic submissions, SCA armorial bearings are now checked for conflict only against major coats of arms, devices and symbols that exist in the real world, and arms awarded within the Society itself. \n\nThus, while a person cannot register the Coat of Arms of Queen Elizabeth II or of France, for example, the SCA's College of Arms no longer checks for device conflicts with arms registered with the several European colleges of arms. In practical terms, the Modest Proposal rendered the Society as autonomous in matters of heraldry as the Colleges of Arms of various nations are in reality.\n\nThe Society's College of Arms also registers and maintains SCA names, checking against duplication and ensuring at least minimal period authenticity. In some cases, names that were once acceptable (for example, Fiona) have been shown to be of modern origin and are no longer allowed. Though bearers whose names were approved before such research are not required to change them, no new submissions with names the heralds have documented as having come into use outside the SCA's period will be accepted.\n\nWhile there is no requirement to register a name and/or device, members are encouraged to do so. Newcomers are often counseled by experienced members on choosing a suitable persona name, and local heralds are usually enthusiastic about helping new members create and register a unique device that represents their personality and interests.\n\nMany SCA events feature food ranging from simple \"fighter's fare\" or a \"peasant lunch\" of bread, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and a simple vegetable or meat soup, to elaborate multi-course feasts served over a period of several hours. Such feasts may focus on dishes from England, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, or other locations and times within the SCA's period of study. Common dishes are roasted beef or chickens with mustard or other sauces on the side, meat pies, cheese-filled ravioli, green salads, \"armored turnips\" (turnips sliced and layered with cheese and spices), glazed carrots, applesauce, and pears or apples cooked in wine. \n\nFeasts are not always limited to strictly period foods and recipes, but they rarely include glaringly non-period items such as hamburgers or corndogs (though there was at least one group which put on a feast in which they documented 'beans and weenies'). As with period feasts, there is often an elaborate main dish or dessert called a subtlety. (One group has a running gag at their annual feast in which the main dish is a mythical beast. To make a \"sea dragon\", for example, they assembled a meatloaf with a dozen chicken drumsticks arrayed along each side.) \n\nCooks who strive to stick to period recipes for their dishes make an effort to ensure that their menus are balanced to allow for modern palates, ingredients, and equipment, or to compensate for tight budgets or labor shortages.\n\nA running joke in the SCA (and at least one song in very deliberate \"bad taste\") concerns the supposed inedibility of feast food. On the contrary, SCA feasts are typically prepared by talented and capable volunteers who work long hours to prepare a good and filling meal—and usually at a cost of only a few dollars per person. Sometimes these amateur efforts even equal or surpass the quality of many expensive restaurants.\n\nThose who work to prepare feasts are highly regarded, customarily being called into the dining area at the conclusion of the feast and thanked with thunderous applause, and many kingdoms provide for awards and titles to be granted to those who excel in this field .\n\nCalligraphy is the art of writing beautifully, while illumination is the artwork decorating the page, usually with paint and gold leaf. Together these arts are used to create illuminated manuscripts, commonly called \"scrolls\" within the SCA. In many kingdoms, the awards that the royalty give in court are accompanied by an illuminated scroll made by a volunteer. Scrolls are also sometimes made to commemorate winning a tournament or competition, or an agreement between two parties within the context of the SCA. Despite the fact that period documents of this sort usually contained little illumination, scrolls are commonly modeled after the pages in Books of Hours, Bibles or other medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, including elaborately painted borders around the text. Scribes use a variety of materials to produce these works. As with other arts, the authenticity of the materials used varies from scribe to scribe: paper, parchment or vellum for the writing surface; watercolor, gouache, acrylic or dry pigments mixed with a binder like gum Arabic, tempera (egg yolk) or glair (egg white) for paint; fountain pens, dip pens or quills for writing. Over the Society's history, the arts of calligraphy and illumination have advanced substantially, so that many scribes now use completely authentic materials and tools.\n\nScribes often attempt to match the period and style of a scroll to the persona of the recipient. While most scrolls are done on paper or vellum, this has occasionally led to SCA scribes creating works on objects ranging from stone tablets to drinking horns. This kind of creativity is generally encouraged, as long as the resulting object maintains a reasonable level of authenticity.\n\nMost SCA kingdoms have an officer whose responsibility it is to train and nurture scribes and, if the kingdom gives scrolls with its awards, coordinate the production of those scrolls. That officer's title often includes the word \"Signet\" from the word for a seal used to sign documents in period.\n\nDance practices are held where Renaissance Dance and English Country Dance are taught in preparation for events and demos. There are also subsets within the SCA that practice and teach Middle Eastern (Egyptian Cabaret, Folkloric and American Tribal Style bellydance) and South Asian (Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi) styles of dance to be performed at events and around campfires.\n\nMany members, including men, enjoy practicing the arts of needlepoint, embroidery, cross-stitch, weaving, lace-making, quilting, kumihimo, spinning, nalbinding, sprang, braiding and dyeing. Period techniques are employed when possible, yielding intricately detailed and useful artwork which beautifies clothing and objects. Embroidery and cross-stitch in particular are often employed to create favors, given as gifts, tokens of affection or awards and often bear the arms or device of the person (usually a lady) giving the favor, or the arms of the SCA Order which the award is being bestowed (Pelican, Laurel, etc.).\n\nWith all the varied activities that go on and all of the people that attend events...accidents are bound to happen. The Chirurgeonate are a group of SCA members who volunteer to provide first aid at the various events. As it says in the \"Official Chirurgeon's Handbook\": \"The members of the Chirurgeonate include Red Cross or ASHI-trained first aiders, medical doctors, military medical corpsmen, nurses, paramedics, St. John’s and St. Andrew’s ambulance volunteers, and many other medical volunteers and professionals. We come from all walks of life and from many countries around the globe. We are united as members of the Chirurgeonate for one purpose: to provide first aid at SCA events.\" [Chirurgeon's Handbook, 2007, 1.1]\n\nEvents, which occur on rented sites, vary enormously, offering a wide variety of activities and are attended by garbed participants. SCA events are not typically spectator-oriented, so attendees are expected to follow SCA norms, including an attempt to dress in pre-17th century garb (clothing). This is one of the primary differences between SCA events and Renaissance Fairs.\n\nMost events will normally finish with a Court to allow for the awarding of honors, and (in some areas) a feast. Evening activities can include bardic circles (formal and informal), medieval dancing, and post-revels (a party usually held at an individual's home).\n\nCombat events involve either tournaments with one-on-one SCA armored combat, or wars where teams compete against each other. Events focused on combat often have other activities happening at the same time.\n\nWhere a typical event may host anywhere from 20-800 participants over a weekend, the largest wars typically draw thousands from across the Society for up to two weeks. The longest and largest of these events is the Pennsic War—a two-week event in August catering to over 11,000 people participating in everything from combat to dance to history lessons. Combat at a war can involve forces numbering 100 to 3,000 participants on each side and can include safe versions of archery and siege engines. The largest event in Australia is the Rowany Festival.\n\nSeveral combat-related activities happen independently at an event. Armored combat (swords, axes, etc.), fencing, and target archery may happen simultaneously on separate fields.\n\nThe SCA promotes the crafts, skills, and technologies practiced in the time period and cultures that the SCA covers. Arts and sciences range from the recipes used for a feast to the armor used in combat, the clothes and costumes that are worn to the bardic arts of singing, storytelling, poetry and instrumental pieces. An officer in the local group called the Minister of Arts and Sciences is usually in charge of promoting these crafts and aiding members in finding appropriate information.\nOther events are set up as a learning experience for the members. Typically, classes are given in history or crafts of the period, or in how to better perform activities within the SCA. Topics can range from heraldry, philosophy, and history to costuming, calligraphy, and metalwork. Some \"A&S\" events have competitions, with the largest offering overall prizes or championships in the arts.\n\nThese events center on the changing of the ceremonial leadership of sub-groups from the local barony up to the kingdoms. These events typically are more focused on ceremonial affairs, concentrating more on meetings and organization than combat or arts and sciences. As such, they are also more centered on the SCA's internal culture than on historical matters.\n\nDemonstrations or \"demos\" are intended for audiences and are put on by volunteers for a variety of purposes. Schools and community groups may request or be offered demos for education or entertainment. The SCA provides demonstrations of medieval arts and sciences, and members often teach beginner classes on the crafts and activities that can be learned. Combat demonstrations are usually of SCA-style combat using rattan weapons, although rapier combat is also demonstrated.\n\nThe Society has attempted, somewhat successfully, to become a more family-friendly environment since its founding. Demos provide an opportunity for interested people to get more information about participation in their local branch of the SCA.\n\nAs interest levels allow, SCA groups hold regular practices for a variety of activities. These tend to be unofficial and informal affairs where pre-17th century costume, while always welcome, is not required. Some practices are ostensibly for one activity but attract people interested not necessarily in the activity itself but more in socializing. A dance practice, for example, may draw the entire chapter together to 'hang out', while a small percentage actually dance. This serves to help integrate the group and prevent segmentation. These practices range from a variety of things from the various martial activities to the various arts and sciences. These practices serve a multitude of purposes. Often the most common practices in a group revolve around the arts and combat, and are organized by a group interested in a certain SCA activity under the auspices of a \"guild.\" Common guilds include those for archery, brewing, cooking, dance, equestrian, fiber arts, period music, scribal arts, and smithing. In almost every group there is an associated officer that hosts these practices and serves as primarily a liaison between those willing to participate and those willing to teach. These practices are not exclusively held by an overseeing group; sometimes masters of their trade will hold regular practices to take on new students and to continue the education of old ones.\n\n"}

{"id": "185337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185337", "title": "Sweater", "text": "Sweater\n\n\"For the a form-fitting garment which covers the whole body see:Jumpsuit or Onesie\" \n\nA jumper or jersey (British English), or sweater (American English) is a garment intended to cover the torso and arms. A jumper is either a pullover or a cardigan, distinguished in that cardigans open at the front while pullovers do not. Some British dictionaries include cardigans as a type of jumper, while others do not; in the latter case, there is no hypernym equivalent to \"sweater\" covering both pullovers and cardigans.\n\nSweaters are worn by adults and children of all genders; often over a shirt, blouse, T-shirt, or other top, but sometimes next to the skin. Sweaters were traditionally made from wool, but can now be made of cotton, synthetic fibers, or any combination thereof. Sweaters are maintained by washing or dry cleaning, and the use of a lint roller or pill razor.\n\nThe term \"sweater\" is a catch-all for a variety of knit garments. Although the term often refers to a pullover, it can also refer to a cardigan, a garment that opens and fastens down the front. Within either group, there is a great variety of design. Various necklines are found, although the V-neck, turtleneck and the crew neck are the most popular. The hemline is typically at hip height or slightly longer, just overlapping the waist of one's pants or skirt, but can vary significantly. It can range from just below the bust in women's garments to mid-thigh in either sex, or even longer in a knitted variation of the poncho shirtdress. The sleeve length is also variable, ranging from full-length or three-quarters to short-sleeved, cap sleeves or sleeveless. The front seam or opening of a cardigan allows for further different styles, such as a surplice or a bolero jacket. All hems may have various types of borders, such as picots, ribbing and frills.\n\nKnitted fabrics are generally somewhat elastic and have a softer hand (feel or drape) than woven fabric, sweaters that are more tightly fitted or have a soft drape may conform well to the body without requiring tailoring necessary in a woven garment such as darts, flares and gores. Even when such shaping is used, it can be knit into the fabric itself, without requiring seams.\n\nAnother type is a sweater vest.\n\nA sweater with an open front fastened by buttons or a zipper is generally called a cardigan, but the nomenclature for other styles in different dialects can be quite confusing. In British English, a sweater may also be called a pullover, jumper or jersey. In the United States however, \"jumper\" refers to a style of women's sleeveless dress, worn over a blouse or shirt, and \"jersey\" refers to a knit shirt, especially if part of an athletic uniform. If sleeveless, such a garment may be called a \"slipover\" or \"tank top\" in British English, while \"tank top\" in US English refers to a sleeveless shirt or undershirt. In the U.S. a sleeveless sweater may also be called a sweater vest, especially if it has a V-neck and somewhat formal appearance resembling a formal vest, a garment known as a waistcoat in the UK In British English, \"vest\" refers to an undershirt. In South African English, a knitted sweater is always called a jersey, while \"sweater\", when used, refers to a \"sweatshirt\". In the sport of ice hockey, the top of a hockey player's uniform had traditionally been a sweater; and even though modern hockey uniform tops are more commonly a jersey they are typically referred to as a \"hockey sweater,\" regardless of the style, but frequently, in the U.S. it is called a hockey \"jersey\".\n\nThin sweaters may be worn tucked into the waistband of trousers; but otherwise, men's sweaters are worn untucked. Nonetheless, some individuals, including some television and film actors, have been known for wearing tucked-in sweaters.\n\nSweaters are a versatile item of clothing and can be worn on top of almost any outfit. Sports sweaters are often worn on tops of sports kit while traveling to or from a sports ground. Sweaters can be worn with a dress shirt underneath (and optionally a tie), which has the advantage of allowing the wearer to have the option of removing the sweater when it is uncomfortably warm and still looking presentable in many situations. Layering and the ease with which it allows for temperature regulation is a major benefit of the sweater as an article of clothing. Various methods have evolved for conveniently carrying a sweater, once removed. The three most common approaches are: around the waist (either loin cloth or knotted in front style) and over the shoulder.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the sweater increasingly came to be worn as an alternative to a shirt when finer materials made them more comfortable next to the skin.\n\nSome people enjoy wearing Christmas-related sweaters around Christmas time to get into the festive spirit. \nSome women's sweaters are meant to be worn belted; a belt or drawstring is sometimes knitted into the sweater itself. Leggings are commonly worn with long sweaters or sweater dresses.\n\nThe uniforms that present day ice hockey players wear are sometimes referred to as \"sweaters\", although they nowadays usually more closely resemble the jerseys worn in other sports like soccer. This is because original uniforms were simply sweaters with the team's logo stitched on the front. However, as technology changed, so did the uniforms as actual sweaters absorbed too much moisture and became weighed down and cumbersome throughout the course of a game.\n\nIn 1926 Benjamin Russell Jr., a quarterback for the Alabama Crimson Tide Football team, was tired of the constant chafing and itching caused by their wool football uniforms. Russell Jr. worked with his father, who owned a manufacturing company, to come up with a better option. At the time, Russell Manufacturing Company made garments for women's and children's knit shirts and undergarments.\n\nKnowing the durability and comfort of cotton they created a new practice jersey that was a modification of a ladies’ union suit top from thick cotton that was produced throughout the factory. These loose, collarless pullovers – produced from women’s undergarments to be used as men’s football jerseys - would go on to become an iconic sweatshirt. Russell went on to create a new division of his factory, focusing solely on the production of sweatshirts in the Russell Athletic mills in 1930. Eventually, Russell Athletic mills became Russell Athletic co. \n\nThe sweatshirt's potential as a portable advertising tool was discovered in the 1960s when U.S. universities began printing their names on the medium. For students and parents alike, university names on sweatshirts became the preferred casual attire for exhibiting school pride. The sweatshirt, along with the T-shirt, provided a cheap and effective way of disseminating information on a mass scale. The T-shirt slogan fad of the seventies inevitably translated to sweatshirts. Recognizing the relative simplicity of customization and the power of clever graphics combined with catchphrases, sweatshirts became a vehicle for personal expression for both the designer and the person wearing them. \n\nSweatshirts are arguably a type of sweater, but made of a fabric and cut similar to sweatpants. A sweatshirt worn with sweatpants forms a sweatsuit a kind of exercise clothing designed to raise the core body temperature and cause perspiration in order to lose body weight before a weigh in for a weight divided sport. It is fashioned out of a thick, usually cotton jersey material. Sweatshirts are also almost exclusively casual attire and not dressy as some other sweaters may be. Sweatshirts may or may not have a hood, and may or may not have a zipper. A sweatshirt with a hood is now usually referred to as a hoodie, although more formal media still use the term \"hooded sweatshirt\".\n\n"}

It is the earliest example in Irish of the diary genre. \n\nÓ Cianáin was a member of a professional Irish learned family who were originally erenaghs of the parish of Cleenish, Lough Erne, but who had served for several centuries as historians to Mag Uidir of Fear Manach (2007, p. 437).\n\nOne of the family's most noted productions was Leabhar Adhamh Ó Cianáin, written in or about the 1340s by Adhamh Ó Cianáin (died 1373) by and for himself, and out of the book of his teacher, Seán Mór Ó Dubhagáin (died 1372). The Annals of the Four Masters cite the deaths of members of the family under the years 1387, 1400, 1405, 1459, 1569, 1483.\n\nTadhg had at least one sibling, Cu Chonnacht Ó Cianáin, (died 1615), a rymer or chronicler to Rory Maguire.\n\nÓ Cianáin appears to have entered the service of Ó Néill during the course of the Nine Years' War; he was one of seven of the surname located in the townland of Portnelligan, Tynan parish, south-west of Armagh pardoned on 6 December 1602 (2007, p. 20).\n\nÓ Muraíle relates Ó Fiaich's suggestion that \"Hugh O Neill had granted them land in Co. Armagh, since it was not the Ó Cianáins' native country. Against that, however, there is a townland called Drumadd, north of Portnelligan and close to Armagh city, whose Irish name is Dromad Uí Cianáin. In addition, it may be noted that one of Co. Armagh's principal surnames in 1659 was O Keenan.\" (2007, p. 21).\n\nBrady and Cleave made the following assessment:\n\nThe miraculous survival of Tadhg's unique manuscript-copy (MS A 21 Ó Cléirigh collection, University College Dublin). Tadhg in his immediate pre-flight year a resident of Portnelligan, Tynan, County Armagh, listed with six other Ó Cianáins as among the follower of Henry Óg Ó Neill in a pardon list 'fiant' of December 1602 (Cú Chonnacht, Seaán mac Conchobhair, Pádraig Óg, Uaithne, Seaán mac Pádraig Mhóir). Tadhg's property—fifteen cows, eight calves, one garron, one hackeny, twenty-five swine, all valued at £22.6s.3d—were forfeited but later returned to his wife at the intervention of the Earl of Thomond, who was a relative of hers.\n\nTadhg died in Rome, apparently late in 1614. He was a brother to Cu Chonnacht Ó Cianáin.\n\nIn the aftermath of the departure, Ó Cianáin's property, valued at £22 6 shillings 2 pence, was seized, but later returned to his wife at the behest of Donogh O'Brien, 4th Earl of Thomond. Thomond claimed to be a relative of Ó Cianáin's wife, possibly via the mysterious Donnchadh mac Mathgamhain Ó Briain who travelled with Rory Ó Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell. No further information is available on his children, if he had any.\n\nHis brother, Cu Chonnacht Ó Cianáin, was tortured on the rack and hanged in Derry in July 1615.\n\nOn 28 March 1627, while collecting materials for what would become the \"Annals of the Four Masters,\" Mícheál Ó Cléirigh made use of some hagiographical material written by him, since lost. (Walsh, 1996). Ó Muraíle (2007, p. 22) identifies this text as \"Ionnarba Mochuda a Rathain\" (\"The Banishment of St Mochuda from Rahan\")—see Mo Chutu of Lismore.

{"id": "1582335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1582335", "title": "World-systems theory", "text": "World-systems theory\n\nWorld-systems theory (also known as world-systems analysis or the world-systems perspective) is a multidisciplinary, macro-scale approach to world history and social change which emphasizes the world-system (and not nation states) as the primary (but not exclusive) unit of social analysis.\n\n\"World-system\" refers to the inter-regional and transnational division of labor, which divides the world into core countries, semi-periphery countries, and the periphery countries. Core countries focus on higher skill, capital-intensive production, and the rest of the world focuses on low-skill, labor-intensive production and extraction of raw materials. This constantly reinforces the dominance of the core countries. Nonetheless, the system has dynamic characteristics, in part as a result of revolutions in transport technology, and individual states can gain or lose their core (semi-periphery, periphery) status over time. This structure is unified by the division of labour. It is a world-economy rooted in a capitalist economy. For a time, certain countries become the world hegemon; during the last few centuries, as the world-system has extended geographically and intensified economically, this status has passed from the Netherlands, to the United Kingdom and (most recently) to the United States.\n\nImmanuel Wallerstein has developed the best-known version of world-systems analysis, beginning in the 1970s. Wallerstein traces the rise of the capitalist world-economy from the \"long\" 16th century (c. 1450–1640). The rise of capitalism, in his view, was an accidental outcome of the protracted crisis of feudalism (c. 1290–1450). Europe (the West) used its advantages and gained control over most of the world economy and presided over the development and spread of industrialization and capitalist economy, indirectly resulting in unequal development.\n\nThough other commentators refer to Wallerstein's project as world-systems \"theory\", he consistently rejects that term. For Wallerstein, world-systems analysis is a mode of analysis that aims to transcend the structures of knowledge inherited from the 19th century, especially the definition of capitalism, the divisions within the social sciences, and those between the social sciences and history. For Wallerstein, then, world-systems analysis is a \"knowledge movement\" that seeks to discern the \"totality of what has been paraded under the labels of the... human sciences and indeed well beyond\". \"We must invent a new language,\" Wallerstein insists, to transcend the illusions of the \"three supposedly distinctive arenas\" of society, economy and politics. The trinitarian structure of knowledge is grounded in another, even grander, modernist architecture, the distinction of biophysical worlds (including those within bodies) from social ones: \"One question, therefore, is whether we will be able to justify something called social science in the twenty-first century as a separate sphere of knowledge.\" Many other scholars have contributed significant work in this \"knowledge movement\".\n\nWorld-systems theory traces emerged in the 1970s. Its roots can be found in sociology, but it has developed into a highly interdisciplinary field.\nWorld-systems theory was aiming to replace modernization theory, which Wallerstein criticised for three reasons:\n\nThere are three major predecessors of world-systems theory: the Annales school, the Marxist tradition, and the dependence theory. The Annales School tradition (represented most notably by Fernand Braudel) influenced Wallerstein to focusing on long-term processes and geo-ecological regions as unit of analysis. Marxism added a stress on social conflict, a focus on the capital accumulation process and competitive class struggles, a focus on a relevant totality, the transitory nature of social forms and a dialectical sense of motion through conflict and contradiction.\n\nWorld-systems theory was also significantly influenced by dependency theory, a neo-Marxist explanation of development processes.\n\nOther influences on the world-systems theory come from scholars such as Karl Polanyi, Nikolai Kondratiev and Joseph Schumpeter (particularly their research on business cycles and the concepts of three basic modes of economic organization: reciprocal, redistributive, and market modes, which Wallerstein reframed into a discussion of mini systems, world empires, and world economies).\n\nWallerstein sees the development of the capitalist world economy as detrimental to a large proportion of the world's population. Wallerstein views the period since the 1970s as an \"age of transition\" that will give way to a future world system (or world systems) whose configuration cannot be determined in advance.\n\nWorld-systems thinkers include Samir Amin, Giovanni Arrighi, Andre Gunder Frank, and Immanuel Wallerstein, with major contributions by Christopher Chase-Dunn, Beverly Silver, Volker Bornschier, Janet Abu Lughod, Thomas D. Hall, Kunibert Raffer, Theotonio dos Santos, Dale Tomich, Jason W. Moore and others. In sociology, a primary alternative perspective is World Polity Theory, as formulated by John W. Meyer.\n\nWorld-systems analysis builds upon but also differs fundamentally from dependency theory. While accepting world inequality, the world market and imperialism as fundamental features of historical capitalism, Wallerstein broke with orthodox dependency theory's central proposition. For Wallerstein, core countries do not exploit poor countries for two basic reasons.\n\nFirstly, core capitalists exploit workers in all zones of the capitalist world economy (not just the periphery) and therefore, the crucial redistribution between core and periphery is surplus value, not \"wealth\" or \"resources\" abstractly conceived. Secondly, core states do not exploit poor states, as dependency theory proposes, because capitalism is organised around an inter-regional and transnational division of labor rather than an international division of labour.\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, for example, English capitalists exploited slaves (unfree workers) in the cotton zones of the American South, a peripheral region within a semiperipheral country, United States.\n\nFrom a largely Weberian perspective, Fernando Henrique Cardoso described the main tenets of dependency theory as follows:\n\n\nDependency and world system theory propose that the poverty and backwardness of poor countries are caused by their peripheral position in the international division of labor. Since the capitalist world system evolved, the distinction between the central and the peripheral nations has grown and diverged. In recognizing a tripartite pattern in division of labor, world-systems analysis criticized dependency theory with its bimodal system of only cores and peripheries.\n\nThe best-known version of the world-systems approach was developed by Immanuel Wallerstein. Wallerstein notes that world-systems analysis calls for an unidisciplinary historical social science and contends that the modern disciplines, products of the 19th century, are deeply flawed because they are not separate logics, as is manifest for example in the \"de facto\" overlap of analysis among scholars of the disciplines. Wallerstein offers several definitions of a world-system, defining it in 1974 briefly:\n\nHe also offered a longer definition:\n\nIn 1987, Wallerstein again defined it:\n\nWallerstein characterises the world system as a set of mechanisms, which redistributes surplus value from the \"periphery\" to the \"core\". In his terminology, the \"core\" is the developed, industrialized part of the world, and the \"periphery\" is the \"underdeveloped\", typically raw materials-exporting, poor part of the world; the \"market\" being the means by which the \"core\" exploits the \"periphery\".\n\nApart from them, Wallerstein defines four temporal features of the world system. \"Cyclical rhythms\" represent the short-term fluctuation of economy, and \"secular trends\" mean deeper long run tendencies, such as general economic growth or decline. The term \"contradiction\" means a general controversy in the system, usually concerning some short term versus long term tradeoffs. For example, the problem of underconsumption, wherein the driving down of wages increases the profit for capitalists in the short term, but in the long term, the decreasing of wages may have a crucially harmful effect by reducing the demand for the product. The last temporal feature is the \"crisis\": a crisis occurs if a constellation of circumstances brings about the end of the system.\n\nIn Wallerstein's view, there have been three kinds of historical systems across human history: \"mini-systems\" or what anthropologists call bands, tribes, and small chiefdoms, and two types of world systems, one that is politically unified and the other is not (single state world empires and multi-polity world economies). World systems are larger, and are ethnically diverse. Modernity is unique in being the first and only fully capitalist world economy to have emerged around 1450 to 1550 and to have geographically expanded across the entire planet, by about 1900. Not being political unified, many political units are included within the world system loosely tied together in an interstate system. Efficient division of labor is the unifying element of the different units, and it is also a function of capitalism, a system based on competition between free producers using free labor with free commodities, 'free' meaning available for sale and purchase on a market. More specifically, it can be described as focusing on endless accumulation of capital; in other words, accumulation of capital in order to accumulate more capital. Such capitalism has a mutually dependent relationship with the world economy since it provides the efficient division of labour, the unifying element of the world economy, through the process of accumulating wealth. Likewise, such capitalism is dependent on the world economy since the latter provides a large market and a multiplicity of states, enabling capitalists to choose to work with states helping their interests.\n\nWorld-systems theory asks several key questions:\n\n\nSome questions are more specific to certain subfields; for example, Marxists would concern themselves whether world-systems theory is a useful or unhelpful development of Marxist theories.\n\nWorld-systems analysis argues that capitalism, as a historical system, has always integrated a variety of labor forms within a functioning division of labor (world economy). Countries do not have economies but are part of the world economy. Far from being separate societies or worlds, the world economy manifests a tripartite division of labor, with core, semiperipheral and peripheral zones. In the core zones, businesses, with the support of states they operate within, monopolise the most profitable activities of the division of labor.\n\nThere are many ways to attribute a specific country to the core, semi-periphery, or periphery. Using an empirically based sharp formal definition of \"domination\" in a two-country relationship, Piana in 2004 defined the \"core\" as made up of \"free countries\" dominating others without being dominated, the \"semi-periphery\" as the countries that are dominated (usually, but not necessarily, by core countries) but at the same time dominating others (usually in the periphery) and \"periphery\" as the countries dominated. Based on 1998 data, the full list of countries in the three regions, together with a discussion of methodology, can be found.\n\nThe late 18th and early 19th centuries marked a great turning point in the development of capitalism in that capitalists achieved state society power in the key states, which furthered the industrial revolution marking the rise of capitalism. World-systems analysis contends that capitalism as a historical system formed earlier and that countries do not \"develop\" in stages, but the system does, and events have a different meaning as a phase in the development of historical capitalism, the emergence of the three ideologies of the national developmental mythology (the idea that countries can develop through stages if they pursue the right set of policies): conservatism, liberalism, and radicalism.\n\nProponents of world-systems analysis see the world stratification system the same way Karl Marx viewed class (ownership versus nonownership of the means of production) and Max Weber viewed class (which, in addition to ownership, stressed occupational skill level in the production process). The core nations primarily own and control the major means of production in the world and perform the higher-level production tasks. The periphery nations own very little of the world's means of production (even when they are located in periphery nations) and provide less-skilled labour. Like a class system with a nation, class positions in the world economy result in an unequal distribution of rewards or resources. The core nations receive the greatest share of surplus production, and periphery nations receive the smallest share. Furthermore, core nations are usually able to purchase raw materials and other goods from non-core nations at low prices and demand higher prices for their exports to non-core nations. Chirot (1986) lists the five most important benefits coming to core nations from their domination of periphery nations:\n\n\nAccording to Wallerstein, the unique qualities of the modern world system include its capitalistic nature, its truly global nature, and the fact that it is a world economy that has not become politically unified into a world empire.\n\n\nThroughout the history of the modern world system, there has been a group of core nations competing with one another for access to the world's resources, economic dominance and hegemony over periphery nations. Occasionally, there has been one core nation with clear dominance over others. According to Immanuel Wallerstein, a core nation is dominant over all the others when it has a lead in three forms of economic dominance over a period of time:\n\n\nMilitary dominance is also likely after a nation reaches these three rankings. However, it has been posited that throughout the modern world system, no nation has been able to use its military to gain economic dominance. Each of the past dominant nations became dominant with fairly small levels of military spending and began to lose economic dominance with military expansion later on. Historically, cores were found in Northwestern Europe (England, France, Netherlands) but were later in other parts of the world (such as the United States, Canada, and Australia).\n\n\nHistorically, peripheries were found outside Europe, such as in Latin America and today in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSemi-peripheral nations are those that are midway between the core and periphery. Thus, they have to keep themselves from falling into the category of peripheral nations and at the same time, they strive to join the category of core nations. Therefore, they tend to apply protectionist policies most aggressively among the three categories of nations. They tend to be countries moving towards industrialization and more diversified economies. These regions often have relatively developed and diversified economies but are not dominant in international trade. They tend to export more to peripheral nations and import more from core nations in trade. According to some scholars, such as Chirot, they are not as subject to outside manipulation as peripheral societies; but according to others (Barfield), they have \"periperial-like\" relations to the core. While in the sphere of influence of some cores, semiperipheries also tend to exert their own control over some peripheries. Further, semi-peripheries act as buffers between cores and peripheries and thus \"...partially deflect the political pressures which groups primarily located in peripheral areas might otherwise direct against core-states\" and stabilise the world system.\n\nSemi-peripheries can come into existence from developing peripheries and declining cores. Historically, two examples of semiperipheral nations would be Spain and Portugal, which fell from their early core positions but still managed to retain influence in Latin America. Those countries imported silver and gold from their American colonies but then had to use it to pay for manufactured goods from core countries such as England and France. In the 20th century, nations like the \"settler colonies\" of Australia, Canada and New Zealand had a semiperipheral status. In the 21st century, nations like Brazil, Russia, India, Israel, China, South Korea and South Africa (BRICS) are usually considered semiperipheral.\n\nExternal areas are those that maintain socially necessary divisions of labor independent of the capitalist world economy.\n\nBefore the 16th century, Europe was dominated by feudal economies. European economies grew from mid-12th to 14th century but from 14th to mid 15th century, they suffered from a major crisis. Wallerstein explains this crisis as caused by the following:\n\nAs a response to the failure of the feudal system, Europe embraced the capitalist system. Europeans were motivated to develop technology to explore and trade around the world, using their superior military to take control of the trade routes. Europeans exploited their initial small advantages, which led to an accelerating process of accumulation of wealth and power in Europe.\n\nWallerstein notes that never before had an economic system encompassed that much of the world, with trade links crossing so many political boundaries. In the past, geographically large economic systems existed but were mostly limited to spheres of domination of large empires (such as the Roman Empire); development of capitalism enabled the world economy to extend beyond individual states. International division of labor was crucial in deciding what relationships exists between different regions, their labor conditions and political systems. For classification and comparison purposes, Wallerstein introduced the categories of core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external countries. Cores monopolized the capital-intensive production, and the rest of the world could provide only workforce and raw resources. The resulting inequality reinforced existing unequal development.\n\nAccording to Wallerstein there have only been three periods in which a core nation dominated in the modern world-system, with each lasting less than one hundred years. In the initial centuries of the rise of Europe, Northwestern Europe constituted the core, Mediterranean Europe the semiperiphery, and Eastern Europe and the Western hemisphere (and parts of Asia) the periphery. Around 1450, Spain and Portugal took the early lead when conditions became right for a capitalist world-economy. They led the way in establishing overseas colonies. However, Portugal and Spain lost their lead, primarily by becoming overextended with empire-building. It became too expensive to dominate and protect so many colonial territories around the world.\nThe first nation to gain clear dominance was the Netherlands in the 17th century, after its revolution led to a new financial system that many historians consider revolutionary. An impressive shipbuilding industry also contributed to their economic dominance through more exports to other countries. Eventually, other countries began to copy the financial methods and efficient production created by the Dutch. After the Dutch gained their dominant status, the standard of living rose, pushing up production costs.\n\nDutch bankers began to go outside of the country seeking profitable investments, and the flow of capital moved, especially to England. By the end of the 17th century, conflict among core nations increased as a result of the economic decline of the Dutch. Dutch financial investment helped England gain productivity and trade dominance, and Dutch military support helped England to defeat France, the other country competing for dominance at the time.\nIn the 19th century, Britain replaced the Netherlands as the hegemon. As a result of the new British dominance, the world system became relatively stable again during the 19th century. The British began to expand globally, with many colonies in the New World, Africa, and Asia. The colonial system began to place a strain on the British military and, along with other factors, led to an economic decline. Again there was a great deal of core conflict after the British lost their clear dominance. This time it was Germany, and later Italy and Japan that provided the new threat.\n\nIndustrialization was another ongoing process during British dominance, resulting in the diminishing importance of the agricultural sector. In the 18th century, Britain was Europe's leading industrial and agricultural producer; by 1900, only 10% of England's population was working in the agricultural sector.\n\nBy 1900, the modern world system appeared very different from that of a century earlier in that most of the periphery societies had already been colonised by one of the older core nations. In 1800, the old European core claimed 35% of the world's territory, but by 1914, it claimed 85% of the world's territory, with the Scramble for Africa closing out the imperial era. If a core nation wanted periphery areas to exploit as had done the Dutch and British, these periphery areas had to be taken from another core nation, which the US did by way of the Spanish–American War, and Germany, and then Japan and Italy, attempted to do in the leadup to World War II. The modern world system was thus geographically global, and even the most remote regions of the world had all been integrated into the global economy.\n\nAs countries vied for core status, so did the United States. The American Civil War led to more power for the Northern industrial elites, who were now better able to pressure the government for policies helping industrial expansion. Like the Dutch bankers, British bankers were putting more investment toward the United States. The US had a small military budget compared to other industrial nations at the time.\n\nThe US began to take the place of the British as a new dominant nation after World War I. With Japan and Europe in ruins after World War II, the US was able to dominate the modern world system more than any other country in history, while the USSR and to a lesser extent China were viewed as primary threats. At its height, US economic reach accounted for over half of the world's industrial production, owned two thirds of the gold reserves in the world and supplied one third of the world's exports.\n\nHowever, since the end of the Cold War, the future of US hegemony has been questioned by some scholars, as its hegemonic position has been in decline for a few decades. By the end of the 20th century, the core of the wealthy industrialized countries was composed of Western Europe, the United States, Japan and a rather limited selection of other countries. The semiperiphery was typically composed of independent states that had not achieved Western levels of influence, while poor former colonies of the West formed most of the periphery.\n\nWorld-systems theory has attracted criticisms from its rivals; notably for being too focused on economy and not enough on culture and for being too core-centric and state-centric. William I. Robinson has criticized world-systems theory for its nation-state centrism, state-structuralist approach, and its inability to conceptualize the rise of globalization. Robinson suggests that world-systems theory doesn't account for emerging transnational social forces and the relationships forged between them and global institutions serving their interests. These forces operate on a global, rather than state system and cannot be understood by Wallerstein's nation-centered approach.\n\nAccording to Wallerstein himself, critique of the world-systems approach comes from four directions: the positivists, the orthodox Marxists, the state autonomists, and the culturalists. The positivists criticise the approach as too prone to generalization, lacking quantitative data and failing to put forth a falsifiable proposition. Orthodox Marxists find the world-systems approach deviating too far from orthodox Marxist principles, such as by not giving enough weight to the concept of social class. The state autonomists criticize the theory for blurring the boundaries between state and businesses. Further, the positivists and the state autonomists argue that state should be the central unit of analysis. Finally, the culturalists argue that world-systems theory puts too much importance on the economy and not enough on the culture. In Wallerstein's own words:\n\nOne of the fundamental conceptual problems of the world-system theory is that the assumptions that define its actual conceptual units are social systems. The assumptions, which define them, need to be examined as well as how they are related to each other and how one changes into another. The essential argument of the world-system theory is that in the 16th century a capitalist world economy developed, which could be described as a world system. The following is a theoretical critique concerned with the basic claims of world-system theory:\n\"There are today no socialist systems in the world-economy any more than there are feudal systems because there is only one world system. It is a world-economy and it is by definition capitalist in form.\" (Wallerstein 1979)\n\nRobert Brenner has pointed out that the prioritization of the world market means the neglect of local class structures and class struggles:\n\"They fail to take into account either the way in which these class structures themselves emerge as the outcome of class struggles whose results are incomprehensible in terms merely of market forces.\" (Brenner 1982) Robert Brenner: Director of the Center for Social Theory and Comparative History at UCLA\n\nAnother criticism is that of reductionism made by Theda Skocpol: she believes the interstate system is far from being a simple superstructure of the capitalist world economy:\n\"The international states system as a transnational structure of military competition was not originally created by capitalism. Throughout modern world history, it represents an analytically autonomous level [... of] world capitalism, but [is] not reducible to it.\" (Skocpol 1979)\n\nA concept that we can perceive as critique and mostly as renewal is the concept of coloniality (Anibal Quijano, 2000, Nepantla, Coloniality of power, eurocentrism and Latin America ). Issued from the think tank of the group \"modernity/coloniality\" () in Latin America, it re-uses the concept of world working division and core/periphery system in its system of coloniality. But criticizing the \"core-centric\" origin of World-system and its only economical development, \"coloniality\" allows further conception of how power still processes in a colonial way over worldwide populations (Ramon Grosfogel, \"the epistemic decolonial turn\" 2007 ):\" by \"colonial situations\" I mean the cultural, political, sexual, spiritual, epistemic and economic oppression/exploitation of subordinate racialized/ethnic groups by dominant racialized/ethnic groups with or without the existence of colonial administration\". Coloniality covers, so far, several fields such as coloniality of gender (Maria Lugones), coloniality of \"being\" (Maldonado Torres), coloniality of knowledge (Walter Mignolo) and Coloniality of power (Anibal Quijano).\n\nNew developments in world systems research include studies on the cyclical processes. More specifically, it refers to the cycle of leading industries or products (ones that are new and have an important share of the overall world market for commodities), which is equal to dissolution of quasi-monopolies or other forms of partial monopolies achieved by core nations. Such forms of partial monopolies are achievable through ownership of leading industries or products, which require technological capabilities, patents, restrictions on imports and/or exports, government subsidies, etc. Such capabilities are most often found in core nations, which accumulate capital through achieving such quasi-monopolies with leading industries or products.\n\nAs capital is accumulated, employment and wage also increase, creating a sense of prosperity. This leads to increased production, and sometimes even overproduction, causing price competition to arise. To lower production costs, production processes of the leading industries or products are relocated to semi-peripheral nations. When competition increases and quasi-monopolies cease to exist, their owners, often core nations, move on to other new leading industries or products, and the cycle continues.\n\nOther new developments include the consequences of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the roles of gender and the culture, studies of slavery and incorporation of new regions into the world system and the precapitalist world systems. Arguably, the greatest source of renewal in world-systems analysis since 2000 has been the synthesis of world-system and environmental approaches. Key figures in the \"greening\" of world-systems analysis include Minqi Li, Jason W. Moore, Andreas Malm, Stephen Bunker, Alf Hornborg, and Richard York.\n\nWallerstein traces the origin of today's world-system to the \"long 16th century\" (a period that began with the discovery of the Americas by Western European sailors and ended with the English Revolution of 1640). And, according to Wallerstein, globalization, or the becoming of the world's system, is a process coterminous with the spread and development of capitalism over the past 500 years.\n\nJanet Abu Lughod argues that a pre-modern world system extensive across Eurasia existed in the 13th century prior to the formation of the modern world-system identified by Wallerstein. Janet Abu Lughod contends that the Mongol Empire played an important role in stitching together the Chinese, Indian, Muslim and European regions in the 13th century, before the rise of the modern world system. In debates, Wallerstein contends that Lughod's system was not a \"world-system\" because it did not entail integrated production networks, but it was instead a vast trading network.\n\nAndre Gunder Frank goes further and claims that a global world system that includes Asia, Europe and Africa has existed since the 4th millennium BCE. The centre of this system was in Asia, specifically China. Andrey Korotayev goes even further than Frank and dates the beginning of the world system formation to the 10th millennium BCE and connects it with the start of the Neolithic Revolution in the Middle East. According to him, the centre of this system was originally in Western Asia.\n\nWallerstein's theories are widely recognized throughout the world. In the United States, one of the hubs of world-systems research is at the Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems and Civilizations, at Binghamton University. Among the most important related periodicals are the \"Journal of World-Systems Research\", published by the American Sociological Association's Section on the Political Economy of the World System (PEWS), and the \"Review\", published the Braudel Center. \n\nEdythe E. Weeks asserts the proposition that it may be possible to consider, and apply critical insights, to prevent future patterns from emerging in ways to repeat outcomes harmful to humanity. (See \"Outer Space Development, Space Law and International Relations: A Method for Elucidating Seeds\" (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012)). Her current research, as a Fulbright Specialist, further suggests that new territories such as the Antarctic Peninsula, Antarctica, the Arctic and various regions of outer space, including low Earth orbit, the geostationary orbit, Near Earth orbit are currently in the process of colonization. By applying lessons learned from our past, we can change the future towards a direction less likely to be widely criticized.\n\nMuhammed Asadi suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a counterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor based on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic accumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose superior economic growth stabilizes the World System run by the command states (counterpart to Wallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition to financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US stabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by the Command States and facilitated by them. Militarized States have a life cycle in which destruction is almost inevitable and since their economic growth stabilizes the dominant economies it seldom translates into personal economic development \n\n\n\n"}
