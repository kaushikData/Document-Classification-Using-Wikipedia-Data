It is considered of a much earlier construction than either the Oseberg ship or the Gokstad ship, both of which date to the ninth century. The Aalesund ship dates to the fourth century and was built during the iron age.\n\nBoth the ship and a boat were discovered in the moorlands, with their pieces arranged in a peculiar manner. They had been cut prior to embedding with sections laid out in a long row from north to south. The oars had been placed straight down and were found protruding deep in the mud. The fragments of the ship were in disarray in a trench, yet seemingly arranged with some purpose conceived.\n\nAn oak rudder is well preserved and fastened beneath the middle of the ship. Six oars were recovered, two of which are fully intact, measuring 3.2 meters each. The Aalesund ship is shorter than the Oseberg ship, measuring only about twelve meters in length. Several huge stones were found in the ship's interior, leading to the conjecture that a person had been buried with the ship. Archaeologists contended that there was no validity to the idea that the ship belonged to the ancient royal chieftain Egill Skallagrimson from Sogn.\n"}

She had one sister, Sabina Forney Stevenson. Daugette grew up in Jacksonville, Alabama, and was educated at Jacksonville State Normal School (now called Jacksonville State University). She was awarded the Elliot Bronze Medal in 1894 for creating the best drawing of heads, while attending art class at Cooper Union Art School and National Academy Museum and School. She married Dr. Clarence William Daugette on December 22, 1897, with whom she had four children and placed dedication towards her family as well as his career.\n\nDaugette served as president of United Daughters of the Confederacy's Alabama division between 1937 and 1939 where she began a campaign to restore the original Great Seal of Alabama and managed a campaign which resulted in unanimous approval from the 1939 General Assembly of Alabama. Daugette made alterations to the seal, and was later made the Honorary Life President of the United Daughters of the Confederacy on May 10, 1952. She also helped to influence passage of a resolution introduced by Senator J.

{"id": "2179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179", "title": "Autobiography", "text": "Autobiography\n\nAn autobiography (from the Greek, αὐτός-\"autos\" self + βίος-\"bios\" life + γράφειν-\"graphein\" to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself. The word \"autobiography\" was first used deprecatingly by William Taylor in 1797 in the English periodical \"The Monthly Review\", when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as \"pedantic\". However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by Robert Southey in 1809. Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity. Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that \"[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time\". Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition. While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. The memoir form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life. \n\n\"See also: List of autobiographies and for examples.\"\n\nAutobiographical works are by nature subjective. The inability—or unwillingness—of the author to accurately recall memories has in certain cases resulted in misleading or incorrect information. Some sociologists and psychologists have noted that autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history.\n\nSpiritual autobiography is an account of an author's struggle or journey towards God, followed by conversion a religious conversion, often interrupted by moments of regression. The author re-frames his or her life as a demonstration of divine intention through encounters with the Divine. The earliest example of a spiritual autobiography is Augustine's \"Confessions\" though the tradition has expanded to include other religious traditions in works such as Zahid Rohari's \"An Autobiography\" and \"Black Elk Speaks\". The spiritual autobiography works as an endorsement of his or her religion.\n\nA memoir is slightly different in character from an autobiography. While an autobiography typically focuses on the \"life and times\" of the writer, a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. One early example is that of Julius Caesar's \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\", also known as \"Commentaries on the Gallic Wars\". In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the Gallic Wars. His second memoir, \"Commentarii de Bello Civili\" (or \"Commentaries on the Civil War\") is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in the civil war against Gnaeus Pompeius and the Senate. \n\nLeonor López de Córdoba (1362–1420) wrote what is supposed to be the first autobiography in Spanish. The English Civil War (1642–1651) provoked a number of examples of this genre, including works by Sir Edmund Ludlow and Sir John Reresby. French examples from the same period include the memoirs of Cardinal de Retz (1614–1679) and the Duc de Saint-Simon.\n\nThe term \"fictional autobiography\" signifies novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own autobiography, meaning that the character is the first-person narrator and that the novel addresses both internal and external experiences of the character. Daniel Defoe's \"Moll Flanders\" is an early example. Charles Dickens' \"David Copperfield\" is another such classic, and J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\" is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. Charlotte Brontë's \"Jane Eyre\" is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., Robert Nye's \"Memoirs of Lord Byron\".\n\nIn antiquity such works were typically entitled \"apologia,\" purporting to be self-justification rather than self-documentation. John Henry Newman's Christian confessional work (first published in 1864) is entitled \"Apologia Pro Vita Sua\" in reference to this tradition.\n\nThe Jewish historian Flavius Josephus introduces his autobiography (\"Josephi Vita\", c. 99) with self-praise, which is followed by a justification of his actions as a Jewish rebel commander of Galilee.\n\nThe pagan rhetor Libanius (c. 314–394) framed his life memoir (\"Oration I\" begun in 374) as one of his orations, not of a public kind, but of a literary kind that could not be aloud in privacy.\n\nAugustine (354–430) applied the title \"Confessions\" to his autobiographical work, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau used the same title in the 18th century, initiating the chain of confessional and sometimes racy and highly self-critical, autobiographies of the Romantic era and beyond. Augustine's was arguably the first Western autobiography ever written, and became an influential model for Christian writers throughout the Middle Ages. It tells of the hedonistic lifestyle Augustine lived for a time within his youth, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits; his following and leaving of the anti-sex and anti-marriage Manichaeism in attempts to seek sexual morality; and his subsequent return to Christianity due to his embracement of Skepticism and the New Academy movement (developing the view that sex is good, and that virginity is better, comparing the former to silver and the latter to gold; Augustine's views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology). \"Confessions\" will always rank among the great masterpieces of western literature.\n\nIn the spirit of Augustine's \"Confessions\" is the 12th-century \"Historia Calamitatum\" of Peter Abelard, outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.\n\nIn the 15th century, Leonor López de Córdoba, a Spanish noblewoman, wrote her \"Memorias\", which may be the first autobiography in Castillian.\n\nZāhir ud-Dīn Mohammad Bābur, who founded the Mughal dynasty of South Asia kept a journal \"Bāburnāma\" (Chagatai/; literally: \"Book of Babur\" or \"Letters of Babur\") which was written between 1493 and 1529.\n\nOne of the first great autobiographies of the Renaissance is that of the sculptor and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply \"Vita\" (Italian: \"Life\"). He declares at the start: \"No matter what sort he is, everyone who has to his credit what are or really seem great achievements, if he cares for truth and goodness, ought to write the story of his own life in his own hand; but no one should venture on such a splendid undertaking before he is over forty.\" These criteria for autobiography generally persisted until recent times, and most serious autobiographies of the next three hundred years conformed to them.\n\nAnother autobiography of the period is \"De vita propria\", by the Italian mathematician, physician and astrologer Gerolamo Cardano (1574).\n\nIt is often claimed that the earliest known autobiography in English is the early 15th-century \"Book of Margery Kempe\", describing among other things Kempe's pilgrimage to the Holy Land and visit to Rome although it is, at best, only a partial autobiography and arguably more a memoir of religious experiences. The book remained in manuscript and was not published until 1936.\n\nPossibly the first publicly available autobiography written in English was Captan John Smith's autobiography published in 1630 which was regarded by many as not much more than a collection of tall tales told by someone of doubtful veracity. This changed with the publication of Philip Barbour's definitive biography in 1964 which, amongst other things, established independent factual bases for many of Smith's \"tall tales\", many of which could not have been known by Smith at the time of writing unless he was actually present at the events recounted. \n\nOther notable English autobiographies of the 17th century include those of Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1643, published 1764) and John Bunyan (\"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners\", 1666).\n\nJarena Lee (1783 – 1864), was the first African American woman to have a published biography in the United States.\n\nFollowing the trend of Romanticism, which greatly emphasized the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's \"Confessions\", a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. Stendhal's autobiographical writings of the 1830s, \"The Life of Henry Brulard\" and \"Memoirs of an Egotist\", are both avowedly influenced by Rousseau. An English example is William Hazlitt's \"Liber Amoris\" (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life.\n\nWith the rise of education, cheap newspapers and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop, and the beneficiaries of this were not slow to cash in on this by producing autobiographies. It became the expectation—rather than the exception—that those in the public eye should write about themselves—not only writers such as Charles Dickens (who also incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and Anthony Trollope, but also politicians (e.g. Henry Brooks Adams), philosophers (e.g. John Stuart Mill), churchmen such as Cardinal Newman, and entertainers such as P. T. Barnum. Increasingly, in accordance with romantic taste, these accounts also began to deal, amongst other topics, with aspects of childhood and upbringing—far removed from the principles of \"Cellinian\" autobiography.\nFrom the 17th century onwards, \"scandalous memoirs\" by supposed libertines, serving a public taste for titillation, have been frequently published. Typically pseudonymous, they were (and are) largely works of fiction written by ghostwriters. So-called \"autobiographies\" of modern professional athletes and media celebrities—and to a lesser extent about politicians, generally written by a ghostwriter, are routinely published. Some celebrities, such as Naomi Campbell, admit to not having read their \"autobiographies\".. Some sensationalist autobiographies such as James Frey's \"A Million Little Pieces\" have been publicly exposed as having embellished or fictionalized significant details of the authors' lives.\n\nAutobiography has become an increasingly popular and widely accessible form. \"A Fortunate Life\" by Albert Facey (1979) has become an Australian literary classic. With the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs as \"Angela’s Ashes\" and \"The Color of Water\", more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre.\n\nA genre where the \"claim for truth\" overlaps with fictional elements though the work still purports to be autobiographical is autofiction.\n\nFurthermore, in the latter years new impulses at the Autobiographical genre arrived from the italian poet and critic Menotti Lerro. In contrast to what Philippe Lejeune asserts Lerro claims that if the truth can only be grasped in a synchronic manner (also according to postmodernist philosophers point of view) and through fragments, why not entrust this narrative to the verse? Why not consider the role of “autobiography in verse” equally dignified as a form of self-narration? For the critic this, perhaps, is the necessary leap: through poetry it is possible to get the most dramatic and highest form of autobiographical narrative.\n\n"}

Their territory limited with the Cantabri territory at west, the Caristii at east, the Berones at the southeast and the Turmodigi at the south. It is discussed whether the Autrigones were Celts, theory supported by the existence of toponyms of Celtic origin, such as \"Uxama Barca\" and other with \"-briga\" endings and that eventually underwent a Basquisation along with other neighboring tribes such as the Caristii and Varduli\n\nRoman historians as Pomponius Mela and Pliny the Elder located them in the northern region of present-day province of Burgos. Pliny the Elder writes about the \"ten states of the Autrigones\" and says the only ones worth mentioning are \"Tritium Autrigonum\" (Monasterio de Rodilla, Burgos) and \"Virovesca\" (possibly the present-day Briviesca, Burgos; Celtiberian-type mint: \"Uirouiaz\") in the valley of Oca River.\nThe other Autrigones' towns were \"Deobriga\" (near Miranda de Ebro, Burgos), \"Uxama Barca\" (Osma de Valdegobia; Celtiberian-type mint: \"Uarcaz\"), \"Segisamunculum\" (Cerezo del Riotirón, Burgos), \"Antecuia\" (near Pancorbo, Burgos), \"Vindeleia\" (Cubo de Bureba, Burgos), \"Salionca\" (Poza de la Sal, Burgos) and the port of \"Portus Amanus\"/\"Flaviobriga\" (Castro Urdiales, Cantabria).\n\nThe Autrigones are mentioned for the first time on a document by Roman historian Livy in 76 BC, describing the actions of Quintus Sertorius in the Iberian Peninsula. Strabo mentions them in his book \"Geographica\", naming them \"allótrigones\", a word adapted from Greek meaning \"strange people\".\n\nAs with their neighbors, the Caristii and the Varduli, their origin is disputed. It is yet clear if they were a Central European Celtic people that originated from the Garonne valley area in Gaul in the 5th century BC where they mingled with the Belgae and migrated to the Iberian Peninsula in the 4th century BC or an Aquitanian one. However, based on the study of their toponyms - as also happens with the Caristii and Varduli - it is likely they were a Celtic tribe who eventually suffered a process of Basquisation. The known toponyms of the Autrigones are of Celtic origin, as \"Uxama Barca\" in present-day Álava, and many others ending in \"-briga\". The toponyms of rivers, as the Nervión, the anthroponyms, the archeological remains, tools and weapons relate them culturally with the Celts, but with a clear differentiation of other close Celtic tribes, as the Celtiberians.\n\nThe Autrigones were culturally related to the early Iron Age \"Monte Bernorio-Miraveche\" cultural group of northern Burgos and Palencia provinces. Additional archeological evidence indicates that by the 2nd Iron Age they came under the influence of the Celtiberians. \nBy the 1st century BC they were organized into a federation of autonomous mountain-top fortified towns (\"Civitates\") on the mountain ranges of the upper Ebro, protected by stout adobe walls of the \"Numantine\" type.\n\nMore archeological evidence have been found, emphasizing their celtiberian culture, such as the hospitality \"tesserae\". These consisted on a zoomorphic-shaped metal tablet with an inscription using a variant of the Northeastern Iberian script (also known as Celtiberian script), written in a form of celtiberian language.\n\nAround the beginning of the 4th century BC the Autrigones migrated to the Peninsula and overrun the entire area corresponding today to the modern provinces of Cantabria and Burgos, which eventually became known as \"Autrigonia\" or \"Austrigonia\". By the mid-4th century BC the Autrigones reached the Pisuerga valley where they established their capital \"Autraca\" or \"Austraca\", located at the banks of the river \"Autra\" (Odra). They also gained an outlet to the sea by seizing from the Aquitani-speaking Caristii further east the coastal highland region between the rivers Asón and \"Neroua\" (Nervión), in the modern eastern Cantabria, Vizcaya, and Álava Basque provinces. However, the Autrigones’ hold to this vast territory was not meant to last; some time after 300 BC they were driven out from southern Autrigonia – the western Burgos region – by the Turmodigi allied with the Vaccei, who seized the Autrigones’ early capital Autraca. Thrust back to their lands on the mountain ranges of the upper Ebro north of the Arlanzón valley around the 3rd-2nd Centuries BC, the Autrigones allied themselves with the Berones and evolved into a tribal society similar to the peoples of the north-west. By the 1st century BC, they were organized into a federation of ten autonomous mountain-top fortified towns (\"Civitates\"), chiefly among them their new capital \"Virovesca\" in the Oca river valley.\n\nThey seem to have taken no part in the Celtiberian Wars though as traditional allies of the Berones helped the latter in fighting off the Roman general Sertorius' incursion into northern Celtiberia in 76 BC, and remained independent until the late 1st century BC, when the mounting pressure of Astures and Cantabri raids finally forced them to seek an alliance with Rome.\nDespite being aggregated in the new Hispania Tarraconensis province at the early 1st century AD, the Autrigones were only partially romanized, never became Christian and continued to provide the Roman Imperial army with auxiliary troops (\"Auxilia\") up to the late Empire. The Autrigone people survived the overthrow of the Roman Empire in Spain by the Germanic invasions of the late 4th century and briefly recreated their realm in parts of the current provinces of Burgos, Álava, and Biscay which lasted for nearly two centuries, before being conquered by their Varduli neighbours and ultimately destroyed or absorbed by the Vascones in around AD 580.\n\n\n\n\n"}

For example, a 1417 document by Stjepan Ostoja mentions \"i nostri boni Bosnensi\", and the same term is used in a 1419 document by Stjepan Ostojić. Ćošković dates the term to Stjepan II Kotromanić (1322–53).\n\nBosnian historian Pejo Ćošković, citing Ferdo Šišić and Dominik Mandić, describes the use of the term in royal documents as membership in Bosnian nobility, with no indication of the subject's religion, and as a political term to distinguish people from Bosnia proper from people from other lands of the Kingdom of Bosnia. \n\nDuring the Ottoman era the preferred term for an inhabitant of Bosnia came to be \"Bošnjak\", with the suffix \"-iak\" replacing the traditional \"-anin\".

In these terms, the Cambridge School is 'idealist' in the sense that it accepts ideas as constitutive elements of human history in themselves, and hence contradicts social-scientific positivism in historiography.\n\nThe text often held as the original declaration of the principles of the School is Quentin Skinner's 1969 article 'Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas'. Here, Skinner attacks what he describes as two \"orthodoxies\": \"perennialism\", the view that philosophers have always debated the same fundamental questions; and the notion that context is irrelevant to a historical understanding of texts, which can be read as self-standing material. In Mark Bevir's words, Skinner and his colleagues \"defended the history of political theory against both reductionists who dismissed ideas as mere epiphenomena and canonical theorists who approached texts as timeless philosophical works\".\n\nThe school has been criticised on a number of fronts. On the one hand, historians working in more materialist contexts such as social history have criticised the school's focus on ideas. Christopher Goto-Jones has argued that the school has developed in an orientalist direction by neglecting non-Western contributions to intellectual history.\n\n"}

The ambush resulted in the deaths of all three IRA men involved.\n\nIn May 1987, an eight-man unit of the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade was ambushed and shot dead by a Special Air Service (SAS) during an attack by them on a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) rural police station at the village of Loughgall, County Armagh. This was the IRA's greatest loss of life in a single incident during its campaign. Despite this major setback, IRA activity in East Tyrone didn't lessen in the following years.\n\nIn August 1988, the British Army shot dead another three IRA men who were stalking a part-time Ulster Defence Regiment soldier whilst he was off-duty near Carrickmore. British intelligence sources claimed the men were involved in the Ballygawley bus bombing, which killed eight British soldiers and injured 28, which resulted in the British Army changing its troop transportation methods in East Tyrone, switching from using unarmoured vehicular transport coaches on country roads, to ferrying them in and out of its bases in the district using helicopters.\n\nThe series of killings which led to the Coagh ambush began on 26 April 1988, when a 23-year-old UDR soldier from Coagh, Edward Gibson, was shot dead by an IRA unit at Ardboe whilst at work for Cookstown Council on a bin lorry. Off-duty UDR soldiers, who tended to be Protestants, were common targets of the IRA in County Tyrone. These attacks fostered a perception among some Protestants that the IRA was waging a sectarian war against them. The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) retaliated by murdering Phelim McNally (brother of local Sinn Féin councillor Francie McNally) on 24 November 1988. This was followed by an IRA attack upon a car maintenance garage business owned by a retired UDR soldier called Leslie Dallas on 7 March 1989, in which Dallas, along with two civilian pensioners that were attending the premises at the time of the attack, were all killed. The IRA, announcing responsibility for the attack afterwards stated that Dallas was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force.\n\nThe tit-for-tat campaign around Coagh continued on 29 November 1989, when UVF gunmen attacked a pub owned by IRA member Liam Ryan, shooting Ryan dead, a customer in the premises was also killed in the incident. On 8 March 1990, a part-time UDR soldier and construction worker Thomas Jamison was killed by the IRA in a gun and grenade ambush attack on a lorry he was driving near Donaghmore whilst delivering concrete to a British Army base. Jamison was an employee of 'Henry Brothers', a building firm that had a contract with the British Government for constructing police and armed forces' instillations. Harold Henry, one of the two brothers who owned the company, had been murdered by the IRA in 1987 in The Loup, County Londonderry.\n\nOn 3 March 1991 the Ulster Volunteer Force carried out an attack at the village of Cappagh, in the attack, killing three IRA members. The IRA subsequently stated that in its view this attack could have been carried out only with the connivance of the British state forces. \n\nOn 9 April 1991 the IRA's East Tyrone Brigade shot dead Derek Ferguson in Coagh (a cousin of local Member of Parliament Reverend William McCrea), stating afterward that he was a paramilitary with the Ulster Volunteer Force. Ferguson's family subsequently refuted that he had anything to do with Loyalist paramilitarism\n\nThe historian Kevin Toolis includes as part of this cycle of violence the destruction of Glenanne UDR barracks in nearby County Armagh, in which three soldiers were killed and 10 injured by an IRA truck bomb on 30 May. The IRA later claimed the killings of 3 of its members that followed in Coagh was a retaliation by the British Army for the Glenanne bombing.\n\nAt 7.30 am on 3 June 1991, three Tyrone IRA paramilitaries – Tony Doris (21 years old), Michael \"Pete\" Ryan (37) (on the run at the time from the Royal Ulster Constabulary since 1981 after escaping from imprisonment in Belfast for terrorist related offences) and Lawrence McNally (39) – drove a stolen Vauxhall Cavalier from Moneymore, County Londonderry to the village of Coagh, crossing the border of counties Londonderry and Tyrone, to kill a part-time Ulster Defence Regiment soldier, who was in his civilian life a contractor that worked with the security forces. Their intent, however, was known to the British security forces, having been revealed by either a Crown agent within the IRA itself, or from covert technical surveillance. In consequence a detachment from the British Army's Special Air Service was laying in wait for Doris, Ryan and McNally on both sides of Coagh's main street, and also in a red Bedford lorry at the scene. \n\nThe stolen car was driven by Doris towards the center of the village, its journey from Moneymore being tracked on the ground and in the air. At the scene of the ambush the British Army had set up a \"decoy\" target for the IRA to go for in the form of an SAS trooper who was pretending to be their intended victim, sitting in his car at a regular spot while waiting to pick up a friend on their way to work, which IRA intelligence had established the behavioral pattern of. When the stolen car carrying the IRA men approached the scene the Special Air Service detachment opened sustained automatic fire upon it from close range. Doris was immediately hit, and the out-of-control car crashed into two nearby parked cars. The shooting continued until the car exploded in flames and set one of the parked vehicles it had crashed into alight. According to an eyewitness, one of the PIRA men in the car returned fire from within the vehicle after the crash. Some reports claim at least two of the IRA men attempted to exit the crashed car and were subsequently found lying half out of its doors by the later police investigation of the scene. Relatives of the IRA men subsequently stated that they had received information from the scene that two of the IRA attackers had fled on foot from the car after the crash, but had been pursued after and shot down by the British Army in the vicinity, with their bodies being taken back to the car, which was subsequently reported to be riddled with over 200 bullet holes. A Royal Ulster Constabulary crime-scene report stated that a balaclava belonging to one of the IRA men was found some distance away from the vehicle. \n\nThe bodies of the Doris, Ryan and McNally were badly burnt by the car fire, and had to be identified by the police using their dental records. Two rifles were recovered from within the burnt-out stolen car, subsequent police forensic examination of them revealing that they had both been used in the multiple murders at Leslie Dallas's garage (see above) in March 1989.\n\nLocal Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician William McCrea – cousin of Derek Ferguson, killed by the IRA on 9 April – declared that \"(the IRA men involved) had fallen into the pit they planned for others... Justice has now been done\". Ian Paisley, leader of the DUP, welcomed the ambush and said \"The time has come for a full war\". Sinn Féin councillor Francie McNally – brother of Lawrence McNally – said the three men were \"good soldiers ... executed by the British Crown forces\". Sinn Fein criticised both the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Gardaí for \"delaying and harassing\" the subsequent funerals of the three men, whose bodies were buried with IRA ceremony. Sinn Fein publicly denied Royal Ulster Constabulary statements that the unit Doris, Ryan and McNally were a part of was engaged in an ethnic-sectarian campaign targeting Protestant workmen. Social Democratic and Labour Party MP Seamus Mallon warned that an \"ethic of violence is eating into the soul of this community\" and that he \"hoped that every effort at arrest had been made\".\n\nTwo months after the \"Coagh Ambush\" (as it came to be known), the IRA shot dead a former UDR soldier whilst he was driving a lorry along Altmore road, near Cappagh, but apart from this, after the Coagh ambush the spiral of paramilitary violence centered around the area noticeably abated.\n\nIn January 1992 an IRA landmine at Teebane killed eight construction workmen (one of them a Royal Irish Rangers soldier) who were working on a British Army base. Another SAS ambush killed four IRA men in Coalisland in February 1992. A month later an IRA bomb attack critically maimed a British soldier at Cappagh and prompted a series of non-lethal violent confrontations between local residents and British troops in Coalisland.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3960503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3960503", "title": "Crime against nature", "text": "Crime against nature\n\nThe crime against nature or unnatural act has historically been a legal term in English-speaking states identifying forms of sexual behavior not considered natural or decent and are legally punishable offenses. Sexual practices that have historically been considered to be \"crimes against nature\" include anal sex and bestiality.\n\nFor much of modern history, a \"crime against nature\" was understood by courts to be synonymous to \"buggery\", and to include anal sex (copulation \"per anum\") and bestiality. Early court decisions agreed that fellatio (copulation \"per os\") was not included, though mainly because that practice was virtually unknown when the common-law definition was established (it remained so rare that first attempted fellatio prosecutions under the \"crime against nature\" statute date to 1817 in England and 1893 in the United States.) Likewise, sexual activities between two women were not covered. Over time, particularly starting in the early 20th century, some jurisdictions started enacting statutes or developing precedents the extended the scope of the crime to include fellatio and, sometimes, other sexual activities.\n\nThe term \"crime against nature\" is closely related to, and was often used interchangeably with, the term \"sodomy\". (This varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Sometimes the two terms were understood to be synonymous; sometimes sodomy was limited to sexual activities between two humans; and sometimes sodomy was taken to include anal sex or bestiality, whereas \"crime against nature\" also included fellatio.)\n\nUntil the early 19th century, courts were divided on whether the act needed to be completed (to result in ejaculation) in order to be a punishable offense. This question was deemed sufficiently important that, in 1828, English law was explicitly amended to specify that proof of ejaculation was not necessary for convictions for buggery and rape. The crime was not limited to same-sex activities, and, in case of an act between two adults, both participants were guilty, regardless of consent. Attempted or completed act of sodomy, committed by a husband against his wife, was grounds for divorce in common law.\n\nHistorically, the offense was usually referred to by its longer name, the \"detestable and abominable\" (or \"abominable and detestable\", or, sometimes, \"infamous\") \"crime against nature, committed with mankind or beast\". This phrase originates in Buggery Act 1533, with words \"crime against nature\" substituted for \"vice of buggery\" in the original, and it was present in one of these forms in criminal codes of most U.S. states. Specific acts included under this heading were typically deemed too detestable to list them explicitly, resulting in a number of vagueness-based legal challenges to corresponding statutes. One of the most recent, and one of the rare successful challenges, is the 1971 Florida case of \"Franklin v. State\". On the other hand, just 7 years prior, a similar challenge (\"Perkins v. State\") failed in North Carolina. (In \"Perkins\", the Court wrote that, if this were a new statute, it would have been \"obviously unconstitutional for vagueness\", but, since this was a statute whose history was traceable back to the reign of Henry VIII, it accumulated a number of judicial interpretations, and, backed with these interpretations, it was not unconstitutionally vague.)\n\nPenalties for this offense varied greatly over time and between jurisdictions. Crime against nature remained punishable by death or life imprisonment both in the UK and in many U.S. states well into the 19th century. Liberalization of sexual morals led to reduction of penalties or decriminalization of the offense during the second half of the 20th century, so that, by 2003, it was no longer a punishable offense in 36 out of 50 U.S. states, and was only punishable by a fine in some of the remaining 14. (See Sodomy laws in the United States for details.)\n\nCurrently, the term crime against nature is still used in the statutes of the following American states. However, these laws are unconstitutional to enforce for sexual conduct between consenting adults in light of \"Lawrence v. Texas\" (2003). The crime against nature statutes are however still used to criminalize sexual conduct involving minors, incest, public sex, prostitution and bestiality.\n\n\nExcept for the above nine states, all other states in the United States have repealed their \"crimes against nature\" laws. Furthermore, in 2003, in \"Lawrence v. Texas\", the US Supreme Court held that nonremunerative sex between consenting adults in private was protected by the Constitution and could not be criminalized under \"crimes against nature\" laws. Thus, fellatio, cunnilingus and homosexual sex can no longer fall within the scope of such laws.\n\n\"See also Sodomy laws.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24306893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24306893", "title": "Criticism of postmodernism", "text": "Criticism of postmodernism\n\nCriticisms of postmodernism while intellectually diverse, share the opinion that it lacks coherence and is hostile to the notion of absolutes, such as truth. Specifically it is held that postmodernism can be meaningless, promotes obscurantism and uses relativism (in culture, morality, knowledge) to the extent that it cripples most judgement calls. \n\nPost modernity is a broad umbrella term for highly diverse intellectual and artistic activity and two postmoderisms (for example post modern literature and post modern philosophy) can have little in common. Criticism of postmodernism in general is usually not a comprehensive attack on the various diverse movements labelled postmodern. Such criticism often refers to specific branches of postmodernism, frequently on intellectual theories in the humanities (philosophy, history, gender and LGBT+ studies, structuralism, cultural relativism and \"theory\"). Postmodern philosophy is also a frequent subject of criticism frequently for obscurantism and resistance to reliable knowledge. For example, a philosopher may criticize French postmodern philosophy but have no problem with postmodern cinema. Conversely philosopher Roger Scruton criticized postmodern humanities and some elements of postmodern art yet never broadly attacking the entire inventory of varied postmodern projects. One of the very criticisms of postmodernism, as a whole, is the absence of a definition of what postmodernism in itself is and even what specific post-modern anything is.\n\nLinguist Noam Chomsky has argued that postmodernism is meaningless because it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge. He asks why postmodernist intellectuals won't respond like people in other fields when asked:\n\nChristopher Hitchens in his book, \"Why Orwell Matters\", writes, in advocating for simple, clear and direct expression of ideas, \"The Postmodernists' tyranny wears people down by boredom and semi-literate prose.\" Hitchens also criticized a postmodernist volume, \"The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism\": \"The French, as it happens, once evolved an expression for this sort of prose: la langue de bois, the wooden tongue, in which nothing useful or enlightening can be said, but in which various excuses for the arbitrary and the dishonest can be offered. (This book) is a pointer to the abysmal state of mind that prevails in so many of our universities.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, Richard Dawkins writes in a favorable review of Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont's \"Intellectual Impostures\":\n\nDawkins then uses the following quotation from Félix Guattari as an example of this \"lack of content\" and of clarity.\n\nIt has been suggested that the term \"postmodernism\" is a mere buzzword that means nothing. For example, Dick Hebdige, in \"Hiding in the Light\", writes:\n\nPostmodernists or postmodern-friendly intellectuals such as the British historian Perry Anderson defend the existence of the varied meanings assigned to the term \"postmodernism\", claiming they only contradict one another on the surface and that a postmodernist analysis can offer insight into contemporary culture. Kaya Yılmaz defends the lack of clarity and consistency in the term's definition. Yılmaz points out that because the theory itself is \"anti-essentialist and anti-foundationalist\" it is fitting that the term cannot have any essential or fundamental meaning. Sokal has critiqued similar defenses of postmodernism by noting that replies like this only demonstrate the original point that postmodernist critics are making: that a clear and meaningful answer is always missing and wanting.\n\nSome critics, such as Noam Chomsky, have interpreted postmodern society to be synonymous with moral relativism and contributing to deviant behavior. Culturally conservative writers, such as Charles Colson, are characterized as tending to look askance at the postmodernist era as ideologically agnostic and replete with moral relativism or situation ethics. Josh McDowell and Bob Hostetler offer the following definition of postmodernism: \"A worldview characterized by the belief that truth doesn't exist in any objective sense but is created rather than discovered. ... [Truth is] created by the specific culture and exists only in that culture. Therefore, any system or statement that tries to communicate truth is a power play, an effort to dominate other cultures.\"\n\nMany philosophical movements reject both modernity and postmodernity as healthy states of being. Some of these are associated with cultural and religious conservatism that views postmodernity as a rejection of basic spiritual or natural truths and in its emphasis on material and physical pleasure an explicit rejection of inner balance and spirituality. Many of these critiques attack specifically the tendency to the \"abandonment of objective truth\" as the crucial unacceptable feature of the postmodern condition and often aim to offer a meta-narrative that provides this truth.\n\nAlex Callinicos attacks notable postmodern thinkers such as Baudrillard and Lyotard, arguing postmodernism \"reflects the disappointed revolutionary generation of 1968, (particularly those of May 1968 in France) and the incorporation of many of its members into the professional and managerial 'new middle class'. It is best read as a symptom of political frustration and social mobility rather than as a significant intellectual or cultural phenomenon in its own right.\"\n\nArt historian John Molyneux, also of the Socialist Workers' Party, accuses postmodernists for \"singing an old song long intoned by bourgeois historians of various persuasions\".\n\nFredric Jameson, American literary critic and Marxist political theorist, attacks postmodernism (or poststructuralism), what he claims is \"the cultural logic of late capitalism\", for its refusal to critically engage with the metanarratives of capitalization and globalization. The refusal renders postmodernist philosophy complicit with the prevailing relations of domination and exploitation.\n\n\"Art Bollocks\" is an article written by Brian Ashbee which appeared in the magazine \"Art Review\" in April 1999. Ashbee points out the importance given to language in \"post-modern\" art. The post-modern art forms mentioned by Ashbee are: \"installation art, photography, conceptual art [and] video\". The term bollocks in the title of course relates to nonsense.\n\nAlan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University, formulated the Sokal affair, a hoax in which he wrote a deliberately nonsensical article in a style similar to postmodernist articles. The article was enthusiastically accepted for publication by the journal \"Social Text\" despite the obvious lampooning of postmodernists view of science. Sokal liberally used vague post-modernist concepts and lingo all the while criticising empirical approaches to knowledge. On the same day of the release he published another article in a different journal explaining the Social Text article. This was turned into a book \"Fashionable Nonsense\" which offered a critique of the practices of postmodern academia.\n\nFrancis Wheen's book \"How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World\" broadly critiques a variety of non-critical paradigms with a significant critique of cultural relativism and the use of postmodern tropes to explain all modern geo-political phenomena. According to Wheen, postmodern scholars tend to critique unfair power structures in the west including issues of race, class, patriarchy, the effect of radical capitalism and political oppression. Where he finds fault in these tropes is when the theories go beyond evidence-based critical thinking and use vague terminology to support obscurantist theories. An example is Luce Irigaray's assertion, cited by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont in their book \"Fashionable Nonsense\", that the equation \"E=mc\" is a \"sexed equation\", because \"it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us\". Relativism, according to Wheen becomes a sort of wall which shields non western cultures from the same sustained critiques. While inherent sexism in North America is open to hostile critique (as it should be according to Wheen), according to postmodern thought it is taboo to critique honour killings and female genital mutilation in North Africa and the Middle East. Relativism will defend such taboos by claiming such cultures are out of the sphere of shared Western values and that we cannot judge other cultures by our own standards or it is defended through diminishing the severity of sexism by either denying its prominence (as Western propaganda/misunderstanding) or blaming it on menacing western factors (imperialism, globalization, western hegemony, resource exploitation and Western interference in general). Wheen admits that, while some of this may have merit, its case is highly exaggerated by relativism. Wheen reserves his strongest critique for those who defend even the most appalling systemic mistreatment of women, even in countries where Western contact and influence is minimal.\n\n"}

Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has said with a medium level of confidence that it is associated with the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and security firms SecureWorks, ThreatConnect, and Fireeye's Mandiant, have also said the group is sponsored by the Russian government. In 2018, an indictment by the United States Special Counsel identified Fancy Bear as two GRU units known as Unit 26165 and Unit 74455.\n\nThe name \"Fancy Bear\" comes from a coding system security researcher Dmitri Alperovitch uses to identify hackers.\n\nLikely operating since the mid-2000s, Fancy Bear's methods are consistent with the capabilities of state actors. The group targets government, military, and security organizations, especially Transcaucasian and NATO-aligned states. Fancy Bear is thought to be responsible for cyber attacks on the German parliament, the French television station TV5Monde, the White House, NATO, the Democratic National Committee, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe group promotes the political interests of the Russian government by helping favored foreign political candidates win elections (it leaked Hillary Clinton's emails to help Donald Trump during the United States 2016 presidential elections).\n\nFancy Bear is classified as an advanced persistent threat. Among other things, it uses zero-day exploits, spear phishing and malware to compromise targets.\n\nTrend Micro designated the actors behind the Sofacy malware as Operation Pawn Storm on October 22, 2014. The name was due to the group's use of \"two or more connected tools/tactics to attack a specific target similar to the chess strategy,\" known as pawn storm.\n\nNetwork security firm FireEye released a detailed report on Fancy Bear in October 2014. The report designated the group as \"Advanced Persistent Threat 28\" (APT28) and described how the hacking group used zero-day exploits of the Microsoft Windows operating system and Adobe Flash. The report found operational details indicating that the source is a \"government sponsor based in Moscow\". Evidence collected by FireEye suggested that Fancy Bear's malware was compiled primarily in a Russian-language build environment and occurred mainly during work hours paralleling Moscow's time zone. FireEye director of threat intelligence Laura Galante referred to the group's activities as \"state espionage\" and said that targets also include \"media or influencers.\"\n\nThe name \"Fancy Bear\" is derived from the coding system that Dmitri Alperovitch uses for hacker groups. \"Bear\" indicates that the hackers are from Russia. Fancy refers to \"Sofacy\", a word in the malware that reminded the analyst who found it, of Iggy Azalea's song \"Fancy\".\n\nFancy Bear's targets have included Eastern European governments and militaries, the country of Georgia and the Caucasus, Ukraine, security-related organizations such as NATO, as well as US defense contractors Academi (formerly known as Blackwater), Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon. Fancy Bear has also attacked citizens of the Russian Federation that are political enemies of the Kremlin, including former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and Maria Alekhina of the band Pussy Riot. SecureWorks, a cybersecurity firm headquartered in the United States, concluded that from March 2015 to May 2016, the \"Fancy Bear\" target list included not merely the United States Democratic National Committee, but tens of thousands of foes of Putin and the Kremlin in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, and Syria. Only a handful of Republicans were targeted, however. An AP analysis of 4,700 email accounts that had been attacked by Fancy Bear concluded that no country other than Russia would be interested in hacking so many very different targets that seemed to have nothing else in common other than their being of interest to the Russian government.\n\nFancy Bear also seems to try to influence political events in order for friends or allies of the Russian government to gain power.\n\nIn 2011-2012, Fancy Bear's first-stage malware was the \"Sofacy\" or SOURFACE implant. During 2013, Fancy Bear added more tools and backdoors, including CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL, JHUHUGIT, and ADVSTORESHELL.\n\nFrom mid-2014 until the fall of 2017, Fancy Bear targeted numerous journalists in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, the Baltics, and other countries that had provided articles discrediting Putin and the Kremlin. According to the AP and SecureWorks, this group of journalists is the third largest group targeted by Fancy Bear after diplomatic personnel and U.S. Democrats. Fancy Bear's targeted list includes Adrian Chen, the Armenian journalist Maria Titizian, Eliot Higgins at Bellingcat, Ellen Barry and at least 50 other New York Times reporters, at least 50 foreign correspondents based in Moscow who worked for independent news outlets, Josh Rogin, a Washington Post columnist, Shane Harris, a Daily Beast writer who in 2015 covered intelligence issues, Michael Weiss, a CNN security analyst, Jamie Kirchick with the Brookings Institution, 30 media targets in Ukraine, many at the Kyiv Post, reporters who covered the Russian-backed war in eastern Ukraine, as well as in Russia where the majority of journalists targeted by the hackers worked for independent news (e.g. Novaya Gazeta or Vedomosti) such as at and mainstream Russian journalists Tina Kandelaki, Ksenia Sobchak, and the Russian television anchor , all of which worked for Dozhd.\n\nFancy Bear is thought to have been responsible for a six-month-long cyber-attack on the German parliament that began in December 2014.\n\nThe group is also suspected to be behind a spear phishing attack in August 2016 on members of the Bundestag and multiple political parties such as Linken-faction leader Sahra Wagenknecht, Junge Union and the CDU of Saarland. Authorities feared that sensitive information could be gathered by hackers to later manipulate the public ahead of elections such as Germany's next federal election which was due in September 2017.\n\nFive military wives received death threats from a hacker group calling itself \"CyberCaliphate\", claiming to be an Islamic State affiliate, on February 10, 2015. This was later discovered to have been a false flag attack by Fancy Bear, when the victims' email addresses were found to have been in the Fancy Bear phishing target list. Russian social media trolls have also been known to hype and rumor monger the threat of potential Islamic State terror attacks on U.S. soil in order to sow fear and political tension.\n\nOn April 8, 2015, French television network TV5Monde was the victim of a cyber-attack by a hacker group calling itself \"CyberCaliphate\" and claiming to have ties to the terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). French investigators later discounted the theory that militant Islamists were behind the cyber-attack, instead suspecting the involvement of Fancy Bear.\n\nHackers breached the network's internal systems, possibly aided by passwords openly broadcast by TV5, overriding the broadcast programming of the company's 12 channels for over three hours. Service was only partially restored in the early hours of the following morning and normal broadcasting services were disrupted late into April 9. Various computerised internal administrative and support systems including e-mail were also still shut down or otherwise inaccessible due to the attack. The hackers also hijacked TV5Monde's Facebook and Twitter pages to post the personal information of relatives of French soldiers participating in actions against ISIS, along with messages critical of President François Hollande, arguing that the January 2015 terrorist attacks were \"gifts\" for his \"unforgivable mistake\" of partaking in conflicts that \"[serve] no purpose\".\n\nThe director-general of TV5Monde, Yves Bigot, later said that the attack nearly destroyed the company; if it had taken longer to restore broadcasting, satellite distribution channels would have been likely to cancel their contracts. The attack was designed to be destructive, both of equipment and of the company itself, rather than for propaganda or espionage, as had been the case for most other cyber-attacks. The attack was carefully planned; the first known penetration of the network was on January 23, 2015. The attackers then carried out reconnaissance of TV5Monde to understand the way in which it broadcast its signals, and constructed bespoke malicious software to corrupt and destroy the Internet-connected hardware that controlled the TV station's operations, such as the encoder systems. They used seven different points of entry, not all part of TV5Monde or even in France—one was a company based in the Netherlands that supplied the remote controlled cameras used in TV5's studios. Between February 16 and March 25 the attackers collected data on TV5 internal platforms, including its IT Internal Wiki, and verified that login credentials were still valid. During the attack, the hackers ran a series of commands extracted from TACACS logs to erase the firmware from switches and routers.\n\nAlthough the attack purported to be from IS, France's cyber-agency told Bigot to say only that the messages \"claimed to be\" from IS. He was later told that evidence had been found that the attackers were the APT 28 group of Russian hackers. No reason was found for the targeting of TV5Monde, and the source of the order to attack, and funding for it, is not known. It has been speculated that it was probably an attempt to test forms of cyber-weaponry. The cost was estimated at €5m ($5.6m; £4.5m) in the first year, followed by recurring annual cost of over €3m (£3.4m; £2.7m) for new protection. The company's way of working had to change, with authentication of email, checking of flash drives before insertion, and so on, at significant detriment to efficiency for a news media company that must move information.\n\nSecurity firm Root9B released a report on Fancy Bear in May 2015 announcing its discovery of a targeted spear phishing attack aimed at financial institutions. The report listed international banking institutions that were targeted, including the United Bank for Africa, Bank of America, TD Bank, and UAE Bank. According to the Root9B, preparations for the attacks started in June 2014 and the malware used \"bore specific signatures that have historically been unique to only one organization, Sofacy.\" Security journalist Brian Krebs questioned the accuracy of Root9B's claims, postulating that the attacks had actually originated from Nigerian phishers. In June 2015 well respected security researcher Claudio Guarnieri published a report based on his own investigation of a concurrent SOFACY attributed exploit against the German Bundestag and credited root9B with having reported, \"the same IP address used as Command & Control server in the attack against Bundestag (176.31.112.10)\", and went on to say that based on his examination of the Bundestag attack, \"at least some\" indicators contained within root9B's report appeared accurate, including a comparison of the hash of the malware sample from both incidents. Root9B later published a technical report comparing Claudio's analysis of SOFACY attributed malware to their own sample, adding to the veracity of their original report.\n\nIn August 2015, Fancy Bear used a zero-day exploit of Java, spoofing the Electronic Frontier Foundation and launching attacks on the White House and NATO. The hackers used a spear phishing attack, directing emails to the false url electronicfrontierfoundation.org.\n\nIn August 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency reported the receipt of phishing emails sent to users of its database claiming to be official WADA communications requesting their login details. After reviewing the two domains provided by WADA, it was found that the websites' registration and hosting information were consistent with the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear. According to WADA, some of the data the hackers released had been forged.\n\nDue to evidence of widespread doping by Russian athletes, WADA recommended that Russian athletes be barred from participating in the 2016 Rio Olympics and Paralympics. Analysts said they believed the hack was in part an act of retaliation against whistleblowing Russian athlete Yuliya Stepanova, whose personal information was released in the breach. In August 2016, WADA revealed that their systems had been breached, explaining that hackers from Fancy Bear had used an International Olympic Committee (IOC)-created account to gain access to their Anti-doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) database. The hackers then used the website fancybear.net to leak what they said were the Olympic drug testing files of several athletes who had received therapeutic use exemptions, including gymnast Simone Biles, tennis players Venus and Serena Williams and basketball player Elena Delle Donne. The hackers honed in on athletes who had been granted exemptions by WADA for various reasons. Subsequent leaks included athletes from many other countries.\n\nEliot Higgins and other journalists associated with Bellingcat, a group researching the shoot down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, were targeted by numerous spearphishing emails. The messages were fake Gmail security notices with Bit.ly and TinyCC shortened URLs. According to ThreatConnect, some of the phishing emails had originated from servers that Fancy Bear had used in previous attacks elsewhere. Bellingcat is best known for having accused Russia of being culpable for the shoot down of MH17, and is frequently derided in the Russian media.\n\nThe group targeted the Dutch Safety Board, the body conducting the official investigation into the crash, before and after the release of the board's final report. They set up fake SFTP and VPN servers to mimic the board's own servers, likely for the purpose of spearphishing usernames and passwords. A spokesman for the DSB said the attacks were not successful.\n\nFancy Bear carried out spear phishing attacks on email addresses associated with the Democratic National Committee in the first quarter of 2016. On March 10, phishing emails that were mainly directed at old email addresses of 2008 Democratic campaign staffers began to arrive. One of these accounts may have yielded up to date contact lists. The next day, phishing attacks expanded to the non-public email addresses of high level Democratic Party officials. Hillaryclinton.com addresses were attacked, but required two factor authentication for access. The attack redirected towards Gmail accounts on March 19th. Podesta's Gmail account was breached the same day, with 50,000 emails stolen. The phishing attacks intensified in April, although the hackers seemed to become suddenly inactive for the day on April 15, which in Russia was a holiday in honor of the military's electronic warfare services.The malware used in the attack sent stolen data to the same servers that were used for the group's 2015 attack on the German parliament.\n\nOn June 14, CrowdStrike released a report publicizing the DNC hack and identifying Fancy Bear as the culprits. An online persona, Guccifer 2.0, then appeared, claiming sole credit for the breach.\n\nAnother sophisticated hacking group attributed to the Russian Federation, nicknamed Cozy Bear, was also present in the DNC's servers at the same time. However the two groups each appeared to be unaware of the other, as each independently stole the same passwords and otherwise duplicated their efforts. Cozy Bear appears to be a different agency, one more interested in traditional long-term espionage. A CrowdStrike forensic team determined that while Cozy Bear had been on the DNC's network for over a year, Fancy Bear had only been there a few weeks.\n\nAccording to CrowdStrike from 2014 to 2016, the group used Android malware to target the Ukrainian Army's Rocket Forces and Artillery. They distributed an infected version of an Android app whose original purpose was to control targeting data for the D-30 Howitzer artillery. The app, used by Ukrainian officers, was loaded with the X-Agent spyware and posted online on military forums. CrowdStrike initially claimed that more than 80% of Ukrainian D-30 Howitzers were destroyed in the war, the highest percentage loss of any artillery pieces in the army (a percentage that had never been previously reported and would mean the loss of nearly the entire arsenal of the biggest artillery piece of the Ukrainian Armed Forces). According to the Ukrainian army CrowdStrike's numbers were incorrect and that losses in artillery weapons \"were way below those reported\" and that these losses \"have nothing to do with the stated cause\". CrowdStrike has since revised this report after the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) disavowed its original report, claiming that the malware hacks resulted in losses of 15–20% rather than their original figure of 80%.\n\nOn October 31, 2016, Google's Threat Analysis Group revealed a zero-day vulnerability in most Microsoft Windows versions that is the subject of active malware attacks. On November 1, 2016, Microsoft Executive Vice President of the Windows and Devices Group Terry Myerson posted to Microsoft's Threat Research & Response Blog, acknowledging the vulnerability and explaining that a \"low-volume spear-phishing campaign\" targeting specific users had utilized \"two zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and the down-level Windows kernel.\" Microsoft pointed to Fancy Bear as the threat actor, referring to the group by their in-house code name \"STRONTIUM\".\n\nIn February 2017, the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) of the Netherlands revealed that Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear had made several attempts to hack into Dutch ministries, including the Ministry of General Affairs, over the previous six months. Rob Bertholee, head of the AIVD, said on \"EenVandaag\" that the hackers were Russian and had tried to gain access to secret government documents.\n\nIn a briefing to parliament, Dutch Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations Ronald Plasterk announced that votes for the Dutch general election in March 2017 would be counted by hand.\n\nThe officials of International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) stated in April 2017 that its servers had been hacked by the \"Fancy Bear\" group. The attack was detected by cybersecurity firm Context Information Security which identified that an unauthorised remote access to IAAF's servers had taken place on February 21. IAAF stated that the hackers had accessed the \"Therapeutic Use Exemption\" applications, needed to use medications prohibited by WADA.\n\nResearchers from Trend Micro in 2017 released a report outlining attempts by Fancy Bear to target groups related to the election campaigns of Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. According to the report, they targeted the Macron campaign with phishing and attempting to install malware on their site. French government cybersecurity agency ANSSI confirmed these attacks took place, but could not confirm APT28's responsibility. The APT group did not target Marine Le Pen, further showing Russia's involvement in the French Elections, since Putin has expressed his interest and hopes in Marine Le Pen's victory for both political and financial gains.\n\nThe report says they then targeted the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation and Friedrich Ebert Foundation, groups that are associated with Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and opposition Social Democratic Party, respectively. Fancy Bear set up fake email servers in late 2016 to send phishing emails with links to malware.\n\nOn January 10, 2018, the \"Fancy Bears Hack Team\" online persona leaked what appeared to be stolen International Olympic Committee (IOC) and U.S. Olympic Committee emails, dated from late 2016 to early 2017, were leaked in apparent retaliation for the IOC's banning of Russian athletes from the 2018 Winter Olympics as a sanction for Russia's systematic doping program. The attack resembles the earlier World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) leaks. It is not known whether the emails are fully authentic, because of Fancy Bear's history of salting stolen emails with disinformation. The mode of attack was also not known, but was probably phishing.\n\nCyber Security experts have also claimed that attacks also appear to have been targeting the professional sports drug test bottling company known as the Berlinger Group.\nThe Swedish Sports Confederation reported Fancy Bear was responsible for an attack on its computers, targeting records of athletes' doping tests.\n\nThe software company Microsoft reported in August 2018 that the group had attempted to steal data from political organizations such as the International Republican Institute and the Hudson Institute think tanks. The attacks were thwarted when Microsoft security staff won control of six net domains. In its announcement Microsoft advised that \"we currently have no evidence these domains were used in any successful attacks before the DCU transferred control of them, nor do we have evidence to indicate the identity of the ultimate targets of any planned attack involving these domains\". \n\nAccording to the August 2018 report by the Associated Press, Fancy Bear had been for years targeting the email correspondence of the officials of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople headed by the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I. The publication appeared at a time of heightened tensions between the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the seniormost of all the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the Russian Orthodox Church (the Moscow Patriarchate) over the issue of the full ecclesiastical independence (autocephaly) for the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, sought after by the Ukrainian government. The publication cited experts as saying that the grant of autocephaly to the Church in Ukraine would erode the power and prestige of the Moscow Patriarchate and would undermine its claims of transnational jurisdiction. Cyber attacks also targeted Orthodox Christians in other countries as well as Muslims, Jews and Catholics in the United States, Ummah, an umbrella group for Ukrainian Muslims, the papal nuncio in Kiev and Yosyp Zisels, who directs Ukraine's Association of Jewish Organizations and Communities.\n\nIn October 2018, an indictment by a federal grand jury of seven Russian men, all GRU officers, in relation to the attacks was unsealed. The indictment states that from December 2014 until a least May 2018, the GRU officers conspired to condict \"persistent and sophisticated computer intrusions affecting U.S. persons, corporate entities, international organizations, and their respective employees located around the world, based on their strategic interest to the Russian government.\" The U.S. Department of Justice stated that the conspiracy, among other goals, aimed \"to publicize stolen information as part of an influence and disinformation campaign designed to undermine, retaliate against, and otherwise delegitimize\" the efforts of the World Anti-Doping Agency, an international anti-doping organization that had published the \"McLaren Report\", a report that exposed extensive doping of Russian athletes sponsored by the Russian government. The defendants were charged with computer hacking, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering.\n\nFancy Bear employs advanced methods consistent with the capabilities of state actors. They use spear phishing emails, malware drop websites disguised as news sources, and zero-day vulnerabilities. One cybersecurity research group noted their use of no less than six different zero-day exploits in 2015, a considerable technical feat that would require large numbers of programmers seeking out previously unknown vulnerabilities in top of the line commercial software. This is a sign that Fancy Bear is a state-run program and not a gang or a lone hacker.\n\nOne of Fancy Bear's preferred targets is web-based email services. A typical compromise will consist of web-based email users receiving an email urgently requesting that they change their passwords to avoid being hacked. The email will contain a link to a spoof website that is designed to mimic a real webmail interface, users will attempt to login and their credentials will be stolen. The URL is often obscured as a shortened bit.ly link in order to get past spam filters. Fancy Bear sends these phishing emails primarily on Mondays and Fridays. They also send emails purportedly containing links to news items, but instead linking to malware drop sites that install toolkits onto the target's computer. Fancy Bear also registers domains that resemble legitimate websites, then create a spoof of the site to steal credentials from their victims. Fancy Bear has been known to relay its command traffic through proxy networks of victims that it has previously compromised.\n\nSoftware that Fancy Bear has used includes ADVSTORESHELL, CHOPSTICK, JHUHUGIT, and XTunnel. Fancy Bear utilises a number of implants, including Foozer, WinIDS, X-Agent, X-Tunnel, Sofacy, and DownRange droppers. Based on compile times, FireEye concluded that Fancy Bear has consistently updated their malware since 2007. To avert detection, Fancy Bear returns to the environment to switch their implants, changes its command and control channels, and modifies its persistent methods. The threat group implements counter-analysis techniques to obfuscate their code. They add junk data to encoded strings, making decoding difficult without the junk removal algorithm. Fancy Bear takes measures to prevent forensic analysis of its hacks, resetting the timestamps on files and periodically clearing the event logs.\n\nAccording to an indictment by the United States Special Counsel, X-Agent was \"developed, customized, and monitored\" by GRU Lieutenant Captain Nikolay Yuryevich Kozachek.\n\nFancy Bear has been known to tailor implants for target environments, for instance reconfiguring them to use local email servers. In August 2015, Kaspersky Lab detected and blocked a version of the ADVSTORESHELL implant that had been used to target defense contractors. An hour and a half following the block, Fancy Bear actors had compiled and delivered a new backdoor for the implant.\n\nFancy Bear sometimes creates online personas to sow disinformation, deflect blame, and create plausible deniability for their activities.\n\nAn online persona that first appeared and claimed responsibility for the DNC hacks the same day the story broke that Fancy Bear was responsible. Guccifer 2.0 claims to be a Romanian hacker, but when interviewed by \"Motherboard\" magazine, they were asked questions in Romanian and appeared to be unable to speak the language. Some documents they have released appear to be forgeries cobbled together from material from previous hacks and publicly available information, then salted with disinformation.\n\nA website created to leak documents taken in the WADA and IAAF attacks was fronted with a brief manifesto dated September 13, 2016, proclaiming that the site is owned by \"Fancy Bears' hack team\", which it said is an \"international hack team\" who \"stand for fair play and clean sport\". The site took responsibility for hacking WADA and promised that it would provide \"sensational proof of famous athletes taking doping substances\", beginning with the US Olympic team, which it said \"disgraced its name by tainted victories\". WADA said some of the documents leaked under this name were forgeries, and that data had been changed.\n\nA Twitter account named \"Anonymous Poland\" (@anpoland) claimed responsibility for the attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency and released data stolen from the Court of Arbitration for Sport, a secondary target. ThreatConnect supports the view that Anonymous Poland is a sockpuppet of Fancy Bear, noting the change from a historical focus on internal politics. A screen capture video uploaded by Anonymous Poland shows an account with Polish language settings, but their browser history showed that they had made searches in Google.ru (Russia) and Google.com (US), but not in Google.pl (Poland).\n\n"}

The events refer mainly to a series of stormy meetings of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China and the top military brass which took place between January and February, 1967, which pitted Communist revolutionary generals Tan Zhenlin, Chen Yi, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, and others against Maoist radicals led by Lin Biao, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, and Zhang Chunqiao. The veterans asserted that the Cultural Revolution was throwing the country into chaos and that its real aim was to purge the top leadership of the party and the military. Mao did not come into face-to-face conflict with the generals but tacitly disapproved of their actions. The generals were denounced by Lin Biao at the Twelfth Plenum of the 8th Party Congress in October 1968 as a \"serious anti-party act\".\n\nIn 1972, Mao backtracked on the official designation given to the February Countercurrent after the death of Chen Yi at a time when Mao felt increasingly politically isolated. Mao rushed out of bed to make an impromptu appearance at Chen Yi's funeral, signalling his attempt to reach out to the old comrades who have been purged or otherwise harmed during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe post-Mao Communist Party reversed the verdict on the February Countercurrent; it is rarely discussed in mainland China today.\n"}
{"id": "667021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=667021", "title": "Follis", "text": "Follis\n\nThe follis (plural \"folles\"; , ) was a type of coin in the Roman and Byzantine traditions.\n\nIn the past the word 'follis' was used to describe a large bronze Roman coin introduced in about 294 (the actual name of this coin is unknown )\nat the time of the coinage reform of Diocletian. It weighed about 10 grams and was about 4% silver, mostly as a thin layer on the surface. However, later studies have shown that this is wrong, and that this coin may have been known as a 'nummus'. The word \"follis\" means bag (usually made of leather) in Latin, and there is evidence that this term was used in antiquity for a sealed bag containing a specific amount of coinage. It has also been suggested that the coin was named Follis because of the ancient Greek word \"φολίς\" meaning a thin layer of metal (\"cf.\" Latin \"folium\", \"leaf\") which covers the surface of various objects, since originally, this coin had a thin layer of silver on top. The 'follis' of Diocletian, despite efforts to enforce prices with the Edict on Maximum Prices (301), was revalued and reduced as time passed. By the time of Constantine, it was smaller and barely contained any silver. A series of Constantinian bronzes was introduced in the mid-4th century, although the specific denominations are unclear and debated by historians and numismatists. They are referred to as AE1, AE2, AE3 and AE4, with the former being the largest (near 27 mm) and the latter the smallest (averaging 15 mm) in diameter. Namely:\n\nFourth century \"folles\" represent the largest category of coin finds in the United Kingdom. \n\nThe follis was reintroduced as a large bronze coin (40 nummi) in 498, with the coinage reform of Anastasius, which included a series of bronze denominations with their values marked in Greek numerals. A 40 nummi coin of Anastasius is depicted on the obverse of the Macedonian 50 denars banknote, issued in 1996.\n\nThe fals (a corruption of \"follis\") was a bronze coin issued by the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates beginning in the late 8th century, initially as imitations of the Byzantine follis.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2505310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2505310", "title": "Greek Homosexuality (book)", "text": "Greek Homosexuality (book)\n\nGreek Homosexuality (1978; second edition 1989; third edition 2016) is a book about homosexuality in ancient Greece by the classical scholar Kenneth Dover, in which the author uses archaic and classical archaeological and literary sources to discuss ancient Greek sexual behavior and attitudes. He addresses the iconography of vase paintings, the speeches in the law courts, and the comedies of Aristophanes, as well as the content of other literary and philosophical source texts.\n\nThe first modern scholarly work on its topic, \"Greek Homosexuality\" received some negative reviews but was enormously influential, helping to shape the views of other classicists. Dover has been praised for discussion of sexual practices such as intercrural copulation.\n\nIn the preface Dover writes that the aim of the work is: \"To describe those phenomena of homosexual behaviour and sentiment which are to be found in Greek art and literature between the eighth and second centuries B.C., and so to provide a basis for more detailed and specialised exploration (which I leave to others) of the sexual aspects of Greek art, society and morality.\" In the Preface he furthermore argued that ‘heterosexual’ and ‘homosexual’ were not antithetical terms, but that homosexuality was a sub-division of the ‘quasi-sexual’ or ‘pseudo-sexual’.\n\nThe conclusions drawn are that the Greeks regarded homosexuality in general to be natural, normal, and salutary, and their actual practices were circumscribed by cultural norms. In the case of the ancient Greeks – specifically the Athenians – the book claims that the sexual roles of the lovers were sharply polarized.\n\nDover concludes that the Greeks conceived of same-sex relations primarily as intergenerational and identifies the terms for the roles of the two male lovers, \"erastes, \"the lover,\"\" that is, the older active partner, and \"eromenos, \"the beloved\",\" indicating the adolescent male beloved. Basing himself on the work of Sir John Beazley, Dover divides the evidence of surviving vase painting depicting these type of relationships into three types. Some show the \"erastes\" offering a gift to the \"eromenos\". Others depict the \"up and down\" gesture – the \"erastes\" attempting to fondle the \"eromenos\" while, with the other hand, he is turning his head to look into his eyes. The third group, usually older black-figure vases, show the couple engaging in interfemoral intercourse or, in a couple of instances, anal intercourse. Traditionally, the young beloved, when he reached the age of manhood – indicated in the iconography by his growth of a beard – would switch roles and become a lover himself, seeking out a younger male for a love relationship. Later in life he was expected to marry and produce new citizens for the state.\n\nTo fail to switch roles was considered unmanly and irresponsible, and Dover points out the mockery that Aristophanes (a very popular and successful Athenian comic playwright) inflicted in passing, in several plays, on a certain Athenian citizen who was notorious for his persistence in the role of beloved long after reaching his maturity.\n\nWith regard to the record of cases in the law courts, Dover concentrates primarily on a certain case initiated by the orator Demosthenes. Demosthenes had been in an embassy sent to the neighboring state of Macedonia which had not only failed to achieve its mission, but was widely suspected of having accepted bribes from king Phillip to abandon their mission. Upon the return to Athens, Demosthenes initiated a prosecution of his fellow ambassadors for bribery in an attempt to avoid being indicted himself. The defendants successfully had the charges dismissed on the grounds that one of Demosthenes' co-plaintiffs, Timarchos, had been a boy prostitute and had thereby lost his rights as an Athenian citizen, becoming ineligible to bring suit in Athenian courts.\n\nDover extensively quotes from the records of the trial to demonstrate, among other things, that while the Athenians attached no stigma to same sex relations \"per se\", they did adhere to certain conventions; in this case, that no citizen could be permitted to sell his sexual favors, which they regarded as the proper function of a slave, not a free man.\n\n\"Greek Homosexuality\" received some negative reviews. Nevertheless, the book had an enormous impact on the study of homosexuality in ancient Greece, partly because of Dover's credentials as an historian and a philologist. It influenced scholars such as the philosopher Michel Foucault, and the classicists David M. Halperin, John J. Winkler, and Eva Cantarella. Eva C. Keuls praised Dover for giving explicit discussions of subjects such as anal sex and intercrural copulation. The historian Peter Gay commended \"Greek Homosexuality\" as a \"model of scholarship\". The philosopher Roger Scruton, writing in \"Sexual Desire\" (1986), dismissed \"Greek Homosexuality\", calling it \"trivialising\". Dover granted, in a postscript to the second edition of \"Greek Homosexuality\", that some of his claims in the first edition about the meaning of Greek words had been wrong.\n\nHalperin called Dover's work \"the first modern scholarly study\" of its subject and \"a triumph of empirical research\", and identified it as one of the key intellectual influences on his \"One Hundred Years of Homosexuality\" (1990). Halperin argued that the publication of Dover's work in 1978, together with the appearance of the English translation of Foucault's \"The History of Sexuality\", marked the beginning of a new era in the study of the history of sexuality. The critic Camille Paglia disputed Halperin's characterization of Dover's work, observing that while it was a valuable book on Greek pederasty, it was not an \"intellectual\" work and aside from Dover's discussion of intercrural copulation contained relatively little that was surprising. Dover commented in his memoir that while he understood what Scruton meant when he called his work \"trivialising\", he was not abashed, since he attached importance to phenomena Scruton ignores. Cantarella has criticized some of Dover's conclusions, concluding that there was no restriction on anal intercourse in pederastic relationships, a claim rejected by the classicist Bruce Thornton. David Cohen has critically discussed Dover's work in \"Law, Sexuality and Society\" (1991), as has Thornton in \"Eros: The Myth of Ancient Greek Sexuality\" (1997). The philosopher Martha Nussbaum described \"Greek Homosexuality\" as the \"best historical account of Greek sexual customs\".\n\n\"Greek Homosexuality\" was republished in a third edition, containing a foreword by Mark Masterson and James Robson discussing the book and its influence, in 2016.\n"}
{"id": "31168227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31168227", "title": "History of the Diablada", "text": "History of the Diablada\n\nThe Diablada or Danza de Diablos () is a dance created characterized by the mask and devil suit worn by the dancers.\n\nThe origin of the \"Diablada\" is a matter of dispute between the countries of Bolivia and Peru. Three main locations exist for the possible origin of the dance. These places are:\n\n\nThe name was consolidated in a historical process of acceptance of the \"Dance of devils\" Native-Miners to the whole society of Oruro, this process covers the period from 1789 to 1944 where groups of \"parades of devils\" be called \"Diablada.\" Finally in 1904 created the primeval \"Diablada\" with the label \"The Great Traditional Authentic Diablada Oruro\", with music, dress, choreography and plot defined. This period culminated with the founding of new groups of Diabladas in 1944, consolidating the denomination. Currently this definition is in the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy of Language.\n\nIts earliest record found in pre-Hispanic times, the dance of \"Llama llama\" dance subsequent ironically devoted Aymara language of the Urus dance dressed as devils, as recorded by Ludovico Bertonio.\n\nWith the arrival of the Spanish in this region in 1535 and the Augustinians in 1559 with the Virgin of Candelaria, it begins to produce an acculturation of religions and cultures.\n\nEthnohistorical development process of disguise and the dance of Diablada fall into three periods, according to the document sent of Carnaval de Oruro to Organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco).\n\nThe debate about the patrimonial identity of the \"Diablada\" concerns its roots as well. Chilean and Peruvian organizations suggest that since this dance is inspired in the Andean civilizations previous to the formation of the current national borders, it should belong equally to the three nations and other Andean states such as Argentina and Ecuador as well. Bolivian cultural organizations and government label this as an \"unlawful cultural heritage appropriation\" and consider that the declaration of the \"Carnaval de Oruro\" as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity gives Bolivia and the city of Oruro support on this claim. Bolivian scholars such as the professor of ethnomusicology and cultural heritage, Diego Echevers Tórrez, express that the \"Diablada\" is not the mere representation of the devils in a defined space, but constitutes the cultural heritage of the city of Oruro with specific actors and environment.\n\nThe scholars who defend the theory of Juli (Peru) identify the roots of this dance with the Aymaran traditions of the Lupakas. Based on the written accounts of 16th-century historian and writer Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the Lupaka natives of Juli in the year 1576 presented their version of the \"Autos Sacramentales\" taught to them by Spanish Jesuit priests. According to the director of the cultural group \"Yuyachkani\" of Peru, Miguel Rubio Zapata, the dance holds Native American roots from the cult of Anchanchu, a pre-Hispanic Aymara deity. Furthermore, rearchers Peter McFarren, Sixto Choque, and Teresa Gisbert state that the \"Diablada\" has roots to the Aymaran narrative of the \"Myth of the Supaya\".\n\nAfter the declaration of the \"Carnaval de Oruro\" as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 18 May 2001, the UNESCO delegated their ex-ambassador in Bolivia, Ivés de la Goublaye de Menorval, the task to be the moderator of the project and handed a form to the Bolivian authorities to be filled in coordination with historians and folklorists, such as Ramiro Condarco Morales, Mario Montaño Aragón, Fernando Cajías, Alberto Guerra Gutiérrez, Javier Romero, Elías Delgado, Carlos Condarco Santillán, Marcelo Lara, Zenobio Calizaya, Zulma Yugar, Walter Zambrana and Ascanio Nava.\n\nThe document elaborated by this group is based in the theory that the modern \"Diablada\" has roots in the ancient rituals performed 2000 years ago by the Uru civilization. The study makes reference to a deity named Tiw who was the protector of the Urus in mines, lakes and rivers and, in the case of Oruro (or \"Uru-uru\"), the owner of caves and rocky shelters. The Urus worship this deity with the \"dance of the devils\" being the \"Tiw\" himself the main character, later this name was hispanicized as \"Tío\" (), and as product of the syncretism, the \"Tiw\" represented the figure of the devil regretting and becoming devotee of the Virgin of Socavón.\n\nDuring the times of the Tahuantinsuyu, the four administrative entities known as \"suyus\" had their own representative dances during the Ito festival, a festivity once celebrated throughout the entire empire but, according to the historian José Mansilla Vázquez, who based on manuscripts of Fray Martín de Murúa, says that these festivities were outlawed during the Viceroyalty of Peru with the exception of Oruro which, for being considered an important miner city in the 16th century, counted with some privileges and the Spanish authorities looked to the other way allowing this festivity persist in this city, adapting itself later into the Spanish traditions between the \"Carnestolendas\" and the \"Corpus Christi\" becoming into the Carnaval of Oruro over the centuries.\nThe ancient authors, Fray Martín de Murúa and Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala make reference in their works to the different dances of the area, including the dance of the \"Llama llama\", name given by the Aymaras to refer to the Urus dressed as dancing demons, as it was recorded by Ludovico Bertonio. This dance was performed during the Ito festivities by the representatives of the region known as Urucolla, a sub-region of the south-eastern \"suyu\" of Collasuyu located in the lake system of the Department of Oruro between the basins of the lakes Poopó and Coipasa, where the Uru civilization had the city of Oruro as their main social centre, becoming together with Nazca and Wari one of the most ancient cities in the Andean world.\n\nThe supporters of this theory consider that the Uru mythology is reflected in the symbolism of the \"Diablada\". The legend behind the importance of the city of Oruro as an ancient sacred place for the Urus tells the story of the chthonic deity Wari, which in the Uru language means \"soul\" (). He, after hearing that the Urus were worshiping Pachacamaj, represented by Inti, unleashed his revenge by sending plagues of ants, lizards, toads and snakes, animals considered sacred in the Uru mythology. But they were protected by the Ñusta who adopted the figure of a condor, defeating the creatures petrifying them and becoming sacred hills in the four cardinal points of the city of Oruro; these animals are also often represented in the traditional masks of the \"Diablada\".\n\nOne of the most referenced studies about the \"Diablada\" is the 1961 book of Julia Elena Fortún, \"La danza de los diablos\" (The dance of the devils), in which the theory of a relationship between this dance and a Catalan dance named \"Ball de diables\", was suggested; more specifically with the elements used in the localities of Penedès and Tarragona. Julia Elena Fortún, unlike other historians in the Peruvian side, disagrees with the idea of considering the \"Diablada\" as a product of the introduction of the autos sacramentales in the Andes, because among the ones studied by her, the thematic of the devil and his temptations was not contemplated.\n\nIn 2003, the newspaper Correo and José Morales Serruto, coordinator of cultural activities of the \"Asociación Nativa Puno\" (Native Association Puno), suggested that the dance of the \"Diablada\" was originated in the Peruvian city of Juli during a representation of the autos sacramentales in the year 1576 to the Aymaran kingdom of the Lupacas.\n\nHistorian Mercedes Serna observes that as soon as the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire was achieved, there was a sudden increase in the amount of Autos Sacramentales presented in the Spanish colonies. Jose Miguel Oviedo records that by the year 1560 contests were held for religious theatrical presentations. This representation was documented in the 17th century book \"Comentarios Reales\" of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega where it reads:\n\nGarcilaso de la Vega further mentions that the Jesuit priests taught the \"Auto Sacramental\" comedy by writing it in Aymara, and the natives of Juli later presented their version of the religious dance to the priests and, later, presented a dialogue to the rest of the Spanish population in such a way that it “changed the opinion that up to that point had regarded the natives as being dumb, rude, or incapable.”\n\nThis same information is used by other authors, such as the Peruvian scholar Nicomedes Santa Cruz and the Bolivian anthropologist Freddy Arancibia Andrade, to suggest that the Spanish influence was spread to Oruro from the southern Bolivian region of Potosí. Andrade considers that the \"Diablada\" recovers the steps of rebellion and combat of the ritual of Tinku mixed with the biblic vision introduced by the Spanish conquerors in the miner region of Aullagas starting in the year 1538.\n\nAnother piece of information collected by Andrade is that in 1780 the army of Tomás Katari wore demon suits to attack the towns of Macha, Pocoata, Colquechaca, Aullagas and San Pedro de Buena Vista, giving more strength to the syncretism and represents the appearance of the tinku-devil. After the silver era in Bolivia, the miners went to Uncía to work for the tin company of Simón Iturri Patiño and during the Bolivian federal war, the miners migrated to Oruro where in 1904 they were allowed to dance for the Virgin of Socavón.\n\nThe \"Ball de diables\" has origins in a 12th-century entremés representing the struggle between the good and the evil where the figure of the archangel Saint Michael and his angels battled the forces of evil represented by Lucifer and his demons. This act was performed in the wedding banquet of the Barcelona count, Ramón Berenguer IV with the princess Petronila, daughter of the king of Aragón and Catalonia in the year 1150.\n\nIn a study presented in 2005 by the Catalan scholar Jordi Rius i Mercade, member of the \"Ball de Sant Miquel i Diables de la Riera\" (board of the \"Ball de diables\" in Spain) and editor in chief of the specialized magazine \"El Dragabales\" during the Symposium of the Catalan Discovery of America, states that the traditional dances and short plays performed during the celebration of Corpus Christi in Spain were adopted by the Christian church to teach their doctrines to the native Americans; their festivities were readapted to the new calendar and their deities were redefined acquiring demoniac forms representing the evil fighting against the divine power. According to Rius i Mercade, the \"Ball de diables\" was the most suitable for this purpose. In this study, he identifies three Latin American dances that contain similar elements to the Catalan \"Ball de diables\"; the \"Diablada\" of Oruro, \"Baile de Diablos de Cobán\" in Guatemala and \"Danza de los diablicos de Túcume\" in Peru.\n\nThe \"Diablada\" of Oruro represents the tale of the struggle between the archangel Saint Michael and Lucifer, the she-devil China Supay and devils accompanying them. Ruis i Mercade suggests that this was a tale presented by the parish priest Ladislao Montealegre of the city of Oruro in 1818 inspired in the Catalan \"Ball de diables\".\n\nDuring the colonial times in the region, from the 15th century till the first half of the 19th century, the ancient Andean beliefs were blended with the new Christian traditions. The traditions adopted new iconography and the celebrations adopted a new meaning during the Latin American wars of independence.\n\nWith the advent of the Inca state religion the inhabitants of the Island of the Sun () were replaced by ministers in worship of the sun (Inti) and the city of Copacabana located in the Bolivian side of the Lake Titicaca had been repopulated by forty-two different nations of mitimaes and became one of the most important landmarks for the constant pilgrimage to the sanctuary; with the migration, two social classes were created in this area, the newcomers became \"Anansaya\" (upper) and the indigenous people \"Urinsaya\" (lower).\n\nThe selection of the Virgin of the Candlemas as the patroness of Copacabana was a sign of the power structures established by the Incas in the area. In the year 1582 a frost threatened to destroy the crops, and the inhabitants decided to build an altar to a Christian figure, but there was a dispute because the \"Anansayas\" insisted to use the Virgin of the Candlemas since Francisco Tito Yupanqui had already sculpted her image while the \"Urinsayas\" wanted it use the image of Saint Bartholomew instead. But the \"Anansayas\"' wishes were imposed in the enthronement of the Virgin of Copacabana and the foundation of a brotherhood.\n\nThe cult of the Virgin of the Candlemas, was then spread throughout the Andes reaching, Oruro and to the west to Puno. In Oruro there is a Sanctuary in honour of the Virgin of Socavón (or Sanctuary of the Virgin of the Mineshaft) who was originally the Virgin of Candlemas traditionally honoured on 2 February, like in Puno, but later the date was moved to Carnival; this transition is product of the Bolivian War of Independence.\nThere is a legend that says that on the Saturday of Carnival in 1789 a bandit known as \"Nina-Nina\" or \"Chiru-Chiru\" was mortally wounded in a street fight and before dying he was confronted by the Virgin of the Candlemas. Some versions state that he used to worship a life-size image of the Virgin painted in a wall of a deserted house, some say that the painting miraculously appeared on the wall of the bandit's own house after his death. And the legend is concluded with the tale of the troupe of devils dancing in honour of the Virgin in the next year's Carnival. The present sanctuary in Oruro was completed in 1891.\n\nHowever, according to the Ph D in religious studies and Executive Director of the Wisconsin Humanities Council at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Max Harris, this legend is related to a historical reality. During the Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II, which started in Cusco and spread along the Andean highlands, Oruro experienced a brief but bloody revolution as well. Pushed by the fear of being target of the indigenous revolution, the majority Creole on the night of Saturday, 10 February 1781, attacked the minority ruling class of the peninsular-born Spaniards () . With the arrival of the Indigenous army the Creoles made an alliance.\n\nOn 15 February, a messenger arrived in Oruro with orders from Túpac Amaru II. He instructed his army to respect churches and clergy, to do no harm to Creoles, and to prosecute none but \"chapetones\". And assured the victory by entering in La Paz \"by Carnival (\"por Carnestolendas\")\", the Indigenous occupation of Oruro started to retreat leaving several thousands of deaths. But during March and April they launched more attacks to the city this time against the Creoles and the remaining Spaniards who unified forces to repel them.\n\nHarris observes that the Carnival of the year of 1781, fell on 24 February, placing Oruro's occupation exactly halfway between \"Candlemas\" and Carnival, making the situation in Oruro in Harris' words, \"carnivalesque\". Religious processions duelled with secular parades. Europeans and Creoles disguised as Indigenous, cases like a Spaniard resorting to cross-dressing tin a vain attempt to save his life and thousands of armed men in the streets of the colonial city. By 19 February people in the city regardless of the conflict continued celebrating and, throughout Carnival, the city markets were full of robbers selling the looted gold and silver back to its owners or to \"cholos\" and mestizos. By 1784 it was customary to rejoice, dance, play, and form \"comparsas\" (companies of masqueraders) for the Carnival in Oruro.\n\nHarris considers that with this background is that the legend of the Virgin of the Mineshaft in 1789 appeared favouring the rebellion as they worshiped the Virgin of Candlemas while the \"chapetones\" used to worship the Virgin of the Rosary. Under the beliefs of the revolutionaries, the Virgin of the Socavón tolerated the indigenous deities or \"devils\" and, according to Harris, if the legend is correct, by 1790, Oruro's miners had moved Candlemas to Carnival and added indigenous gods, masked as Christian devils, to the festivities.\n\nIn 1818, Oruro's parish priest, Ladislao Montealegre, wrote the play \"Narrative of the seven deadly sins\", where according to Harris and Fortún, borrowed elements of the Catalan \"Ball de diables\" like the female devil, \"Diablesa\" in the Catalan dance and \"China supay\" in the Diablada and where the Devil leads the Seven Deadly Sins into battle against the opposing Virtues and an angel. Harris suggests that Montealegre may have wanted to represent the threat of rebellion and the historical context with this play.\n\nA generation later, in 1825 after Bolivia achieved its independence, the \"Diablada\" and the Carnival adopted a new meaning for Oruro's residents. Two of the \"Diablada\" dance squads and the street from where the parade starts are named after Sebastian Pagador, one of the Creole heroes of the uprising. And the main square which is in the route of the Carnival to the Virgin of the Mineshaft temple is named \"Plaza 10 de febrero\" (10 February square) remembering the date of the uprising.\n"}

He was one of Malik's main companions and had a tremendous influence in recording the positions of the school. Ibn al-Qasim was the source for Sahnun in his Mudawwana, a record of Malik's teachings. He has the same position in the Maliki school as Muhammad al-Shaybani has in the Hanafi school, in so far as both of them transmitted their respective schools and made free use of ijtihad (independent reasoning). Ibn al-Qasim had opinions which differed from those of Malik, to the point that it was said that he was dominated by opinion.\n\nIbn al-Qasim's full name was 'Abd ar-Rahman ibn ibn al-Qasim al-'Utaqi although he was well known as Ibn al-Qasim. He was born in Egypt in a mosque known as the 'Utaqi Mosque in the mid 8th century CE at a time when the Abbasids took control of the Muslim world from the Umayyads. Ibn al-Qasim's origins were from the Palestinian town of Ramla. He was a descendant from the slaves of Ta'if whom the Prophet Muhammad had freed. Ibn al-Qasim's father was in the Dewan, and he used the money he inherited from him for his studies.\n\nHe travelled from Egypt to Medina after what is recorded as a visionary dream and after having been drawn to gatherings of religious knowledge in Egypt. In Medina, he met Malik as well as Ibn Wahb, another of Malik's famous companions. Ibn al-Qasim kept the company of Malik for the relatively long period of about twenty years. It was from him that he learned his fiqh (jurisprudence). In Medina he also met Al-Layth, Ibn al-Majishun and Muslim ibn Khalid al-Zanji. Many people related from him and consulted him about Malik's fatwas. Ibn Wahb used to say, \"If you want this business – meaning the fiqh of Malik – you must have Ibn al-Qasim. He is unique in it\". His transmission of the Muwatta is considered to be the soundest transmission, and Sahnun learned the contents of the Mudawwana, the most comprehensive collection of Maliki fiqh, from him. Thus he can be considered as the main transmitter of Maliki fiqh, for the Mudawwana is its chief source.\n\nIbn al-Qasim was generally known for his vast knowledge. When Malik was asked about him and Ibn Wahb, he replied that Ibn Wahb was a knowledgeble man whilst Ibn al-Qasim was a true faqih (jurist). He was also known as having ascetic qualities and spent much of his time reciting the Quran such that he would finish many readings in a short space of time. On his return to Egypt he refused to marry the daughters of wealthy officials and generally kept clear of the ruling class. He died in Egypt at the age of 63 in the month of Safar, 191 AH (806 CE) three days after returning from a trip to Mecca. Ibn al-Qasim left behind him two sons Abd ar-Rahman and 'Umar.\n"}
{"id": "16531537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16531537", "title": "Industrious Revolution", "text": "Industrious Revolution\n\nThe Industrious Revolution is the title given to a period of time, usually given as between 1600 and 1800 that led up to the Industrial Revolution. It is a term first coined by the Japanese demographic historian Akira Hayami , and accepted by other historians to help further explain the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Much of this theory deals with the spending behaviours of families in the period. It also deals with the production and consumption of goods. In fact, Industrious Revolutions are often characterized by a rise in demand for \"market-supplied goods\", which will minimize the value of domestic goods, before the ultimate consumption. Industrious Revolutions often occur during a period where labour wages have stagnated or decreased. The theory of a pre-industrial Industrious Revolution is contested within the history community.\n\nHayami introduced the concept of Industrious Revolution in a Japanese-language work published in 1967. It was coined to compare the labour-intensive technologies of Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868) with the capital-intensive technologies of Britain's Industrial Revolution. Hayami observed that the two countries took different paths due to the different mix of factor endowments (capital for Britain and labour for Japan). He introduced Industrious Revolution to describe the Japanese developmental trajectory, which - lacking the British capital - exploited the benefits of increasing labour absorption. \n\nThis proposed Industrious Revolution does not aim to replace the Industrial Revolution in history; rather it is designed to supplement it. By revamping the history of the period directly preceding the Industrial Revolution, some historians hope to ensure that people get a better understanding of a particular aspect of the Early Modern Period.\nThe basic picture painted of the pre-Industrial Revolution is that the Industrial Revolution was the result of a surplus of money and crops, which led to the development of new technology. This new technology eventually developed into factories. The Industrious Revolution addresses this belief, saying instead, that the overwhelming desire for more goods directly preceded the Industrial Revolution. The theory states that during the Industrious Revolution there was an increase in demand for goods, but that supply did not rise as quickly.\nEventually, some achievements of industry and agriculture, as well as the decisions made by households, helped to increase the supply, as well as the demand for goods. These behaviours, when combined constitute an Industrious Revolution. A quick summation of the differences between the Industrious Revolution and the Industrial Revolution is that the former is concerned with demand, and the latter is supply based. The right mindset to a productional economy and world may have increased the supply of technology, but they would have had little impact on invention without a demand for new techniques. \nThe theory of an Industrious Revolution, as put forward by historian Jan de Vries, claims that there were two parts to the Industrious Revolution. First, there was a reduction of leisure time as the utility of monetary income rose. Second, the focus of labour shifted from goods and services to marketable goods. \n\nSome within the field of cultural history have theorized that a further motive for an industrious revolution is a shift in the view on what it takes for an individual to be considered independent. Independence was equated with land ownership prior to an industrious revolution. Wage earners were granted a degraded and dependent status. Typically, as in the case of pre-industrial Great Britain and America, these dependent sorts were deemed unworthy of full citizenship rights. Industrious revolutions shift the meaning of independence from land-holding to earning a competency. A wage earner could now be considered independent if he/she earned enough money to support a household. Hard work was viewed as essential for reaching this goal.\n\nOne of the suggested hallmarks of an Industrious Revolution is that of increased work days. However, according to historians Gregory Clark and Ysbrand Van Der Werf, there has been no information found to suggest an increase in work days, in the time period between the Medieval Period and the nineteenth century. These records even indicate that before 1750, some people were working three hundred days per year. Even in the period preceding the Industrial Revolution people were working at least two hundred and ninety days in a year. So, this information would demonstrate that there was very little increase in days worked. Since increase in work loads is one of the suggested hallmarks of an Industrious Revolution, this would work against the theory.\nClark and Van Der Werf have also examined the output of a couple of English industries. For one, they looked at records of the saw mills in England. Between 1300 and 1800, the period directly preceding and following the proposed Industrious Revolution, the estimated amount of lumber sawed increased about eighty percent. However, this increase in lumber sawed can be attributed to new technologies, and not in fact the influence of an Industrious Revolution. In contrast, they mention the threshing industry. Unlike the lumber sawing business, this industry shows “clear downward movement” in threshing rates, after which there are no longer any trends. This information would help to disprove the idea of an Industrious Revolution, since, as it has been put forth, there is no universal trend displaying an increase of work habits.\n\nIn a later work, Hayami cited that de Vries and other theorists' interpretations did not use the term in the same way he does. Hayami noted that these saw Industrious Revolution and Industrial Revolution as a continuum while the original idea considers the two revolutions as opposing concepts. Hayami also stressed that the term explained how the Japanese became industrious for some reason at one point and that eventually they will no longer be. \n\nPrior the proposed era of the Industrious Revolution most goods were produced either by household or by guilds. There were many households involved in the production of marketable goods. Most of what was produced by these households were things that involved cloth- textiles, clothing, as well as art, and tapestries. These would be produced by the households, or by their respective guilds. It was even possible for guilds and merchants to outsource into more rural areas, to get some of the work done. These merchants would bring the raw materials to the workers, who would then, using the supplied materials, make the goods. For example, young girls would be hired to make silk, because they were the only people believed to have hands dexterous enough to make the silk properly. Other occupations such as knitting, a job that was never organized into guilds, could easily be done within the household.\n\nThe income of the household became dependent upon the quality and the quantity of everyone's work. Even if people were not working for an individual guild they could still supply and make items not controlled by the guilds. These would be small, but necessary items like wooden dishes, or soaps. So, basically, much of production was done by, or for, guilds. This would indicate that much of what was done was not done for one individual household, but for a larger group or organization. \n\nPrior to the Industrious Revolution, the household was the major site of production, and could be comparable to a factory. However, things were to change a bit during the Industrious Revolution. If the theory is to be believed, then there was a shift in the running of the household. The everyday goods and products used by the household would slowly shift from mostly homemade, to mostly \"commercially produced goods\". At the same time, the women would be more than likely to be able to attain jobs outside of the household. This is also seen within the context of the Industrial Revolution, where women would often find small jobs to help supplement their husband's wages. This would demonstrate the gradual movement away from the household as a centre of production.\n\nThe patterns of consumption present in England at this time period were similar to what one might find in Europe, as well as in some of the Ottoman territories. This is unsurprising, however, since most of Europe and the Ottoman Empire were all connected through trade. Through these trade connections, people were able to buy many of the luxury goods that they desired. Very common amongst the nobility was the idea of Conspicuous consumption. This can be traced back, even into the Middle Ages. People, the nobility especially, had trade connections throughout Europe, and many of them would use these connections to buy the works of art, etc. that they desired. This does not extend only to the rich however: even Medieval peasants enjoyed imported luxury items; there is evidence to suggest that some English peasants drank imported French wine.\n\nPeople were consuming products well before the Industrious Revolution. There were stock exchanges all over Europe, even London. People were also clearly making products for consumption, as the large number of guilds existing within Europe at that point would suggest. What would cause the period between 1600 and 1800 to be labeled an Industrious Revolution, by looking at the patterns of consumption, is the rise in demand for these products. So, what would set this period in time apart would be more demands for luxury items. Especially those items that could not be produced in the homes or by the guilds. During the proposed Industrious Revolution, this demand for luxury items would be greater than the supply could accommodate. A rise in the rate at which people were consuming goods, especially when combined with other factors of the times, could have potentially heralded the Industrious Revolution.\n\n"}

Nistor (August 16, 1876 – November 11, 1962) was a Romanian historian and politician. He was a member of the Romanian Academy after 1911, and served as administrator of its Library.\n\nNistor was born into a family of peasants in the Bivolărie hamlet of Vicovul de Sus, Bukovina — in Austria-Hungary at the time, it is now included in Suceava County, Romania. He studied at the local school in Vicovul de Sus, then at Elementary School of Rădăuţi and at the Rădăuţi German High School, getting his \"Matura\" in 1897.\n\nHe then studied Philosophy and Literature at the University of Czernowitz and between 1898 and 1900, he completed his military service in the Austro-Hungarian Army (serving in Polei and in Vienna), and graduated from the University in 1902, after which he was named teacher of history and geography at the Suceava Classic High school. Together with some of his friends, Nistor edited a magazine titled \"Junimea Literară\" between 1904 and 1914, first published in Rădăuţi and then in Suceava.\n\nIn 1904, Nistor married Virginia Pauliuc, daughter of the Gheorghe Pauliuc (a Romanian Orthodox priest from Burla), and, one year later, on July 5, 1905, Oltea, his only child, was born. He then moved to teach at the Orthodox High School, making use of the institution's library, better suited to his studies into the history of Moldavia.\n\nIn 1908-1909 and 1910–1911, he studied at the University of Vienna and completed his PhD under Konstantin Josef Jireček, with a thesis on \"Moldavia's aspirations regarding Pokuttya\". After that, he furthered his studies at the Universities of Munich, Leipzig and Berlin, receiving (1911) his \"Docent\" title and the \"Venia legendi\", which allowed him to teach at the University of Vienna, where he gave lectures on the history of the Romanians.\n\nA year later, in 1912, he moved to Czernowitz, to hold the chair of Southeastern European history, but after the start of World War I, he moved to the Romanian Old Kingdom, where he published various studies on the history of Bukovina. He was elected a member of the Romanian Academy in 1915. He also authored an ethnographic map of Bukovina under Austrian domination (\"see Cisleithania\"), based on the census of 1910.\n\nLiving in Iaşi by the time Romania entered the war on the Entente side, Nistor left Romania at the climax of the Romanian Campaign (when troops of the Central Powers threatened the region). In July 1917, he moved to Odessa, in territory held by the Russian Provisional Government, and began teaching Romanian history to the (mostly Bessarabian) students at the University of Novorossiya. He interrupted the course in November 1917, after a group of armed Russian revolutionaries broke into the University building. Nistor was, however, safely escorted outside by some of the Bessarabian soldiers who were part of his audience.\n\nIn February 1918, together with other Austro-Hungarian refugees (including Octavian Goga), Nistor departed for Ovidiopol, Cetatea Albă and then finally reached Chişinău. He stayed in the city, where he argued for the founding of a Moldavian University, and soon began lecturing on the History of the Romanians. He used the data gathered from the Chişinău Archives to write the \"History of Bessarabia\", published in 1923. Nistor also witnessed the Sfatul Ţării session which voted the union with Romania.\n\nAfter the war ended, he returned to his native Bukovina and he was one of the members of the National Assembly of Bukovina in Cernăuţi, which voted for the union with Romania on November 28, 1918. Nistor was also one of the fifteen Bukovinans who presented the Union Act to Romania's King Ferdinand I.\n\nNistor presided upon the Democratic Union Party, which had a centralist agenda. Between December 18 and May 2, he was a member of Greater Romania's Ion I. C. Brătianu government, as a Minister for Bukovina, and, between February 14 and February 27, also held the rank of minister for Bessarabia, while the nominal minister was delegated to the Paris Peace Conference. Between May 1920 and January 1922, Nistor was a Senator in the Parliament of Romania.\n\nIn the interwar period, Nistor wrote many historical works, including \"The Origin of Romanians and the Vlachs of Thessalia and Epirus\" and \"The History of Romanians in Transnistria\" (1925). He was also the director of the historical magazine \"Codrii Cosminului\", which was published between 1924 and 1939.\n\nElected rector of the University of Cernăuţi in 1920, serving as such until 1921, and again from 1933 to 1940. Also in 1920, he joined the National Liberal Party (PNL), and was again the Minister of State for Bukovina in the fourth Brătianu cabinet (1922–1926), Minister of Public Works in the fifth Brătianu cabinet (1927–1928), and Minister of Labour in the first Gheorghe Tătărescu cabinet (1934). In 1938, he broke with the PNL and sided with the National Renaissance Front regime established by King Carol II, and was Minister of the Cults and Arts in the second Tătărescu cabinet (November 24, 1939–May 12, 1940).\n\nStarting October 1940, under the National Legionary State, Nistor taught at the University of Bucharest, becoming the target of Iron Guard persecutions for the support he had given to King Carol. Following the Guard's defeat during the Legionnaires' Rebellion of 1941, he sent a congratulatory telegram to \"Conducător\" Ion Antonescu.

A trans woman, she was published under her birth name, James, until 1972, when she had sex reassignment after transitioning from living as male to living as female.\n\nBorn in England of an English mother and Welsh father, Morris was educated at Lancing College, West Sussex, and Christ Church, Oxford, and considers herself Welsh.\n\nIn the closing stages of the Second World War Morris served in the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers, and in 1945 was posted to the Free Territory of Trieste, during the joint British-American occupation.\n\nAfter the war Morris wrote for \"The Times\", and in 1953 was its correspondent accompanying the British Mount Everest Expedition, which in the event was the first to scale Mount Everest. Morris reported the success of Hillary and Tenzing in a coded message to the newspaper, \"Snow conditions bad stop advanced base abandoned yesterday stop awaiting improvement\", and by happy coincidence the news was released on the morning of Queen Elizabeth's coronation.\n\nReporting from Cyprus on the Suez Crisis for \"The Manchester Guardian\" in 1956, Morris produced the first \"irrefutable proof\" of collusion between France and Israel in the invasion of Egyptian territory, interviewing French Air Force pilots who confirmed that they had been in action in support of Israeli forces.\n\nMorris opposed the Falklands War.\n\nIn 1949, Morris married Elizabeth Tuckniss, the daughter of a tea planter; they had five children together, including the poet and musician Twm Morys. One of their children died in infancy.\n\nMorris began a sex change in 1964. In 1972, Morris travelled to Morocco to undergo sex reassignment surgery, performed by surgeon Georges Burou, because doctors in Britain refused to allow the procedure unless Morris and Tuckniss divorced, something Morris was not prepared to do at the time. They divorced later, but remained together and on 14 May 2008 were legally reunited when they formally entered into a civil partnership. \n\nMorris detailed her transition in \"Conundrum\" (1974), her first book under her new name, and one of the first autobiographies to discuss a personal gender reassignment. \n\nMorris lives mostly in north Wales.\n\nMorris has received honorary doctorates from the University of Wales and the University of Glamorgan, is an honorary fellow of Christ Church, Oxford, and is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

{"id": "5945134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5945134", "title": "Monheim, Bavaria", "text": "Monheim, Bavaria\n\nMonheim is a town in the Donau-Ries district, in Bavaria, Germany. It is situated 15 km northeast of Donauwörth, and 27 km east of Nördlingen. It lies in the Regierungsbezirk Schwaben.\n\nThe origins of Monheim date back into the 7th century, when a village was formed at the crossing of the Gailach, a small river running into the Altmühl. From 870, a Benedictian convent existed within the small town. In 893, the abbess of the convent, Mother Liubila, transferred it to the Bishop of Eichstätt, Erchanbald, and it was then that Monheim was first mentioned in an official document. It became an important place of pilgrimage due to the relics of Saint Walpurga, a former abbess of the convent in Eichstätt. Unlike virtually all of Schwaben, which belongs to the Diocese of Augsburg, Monheim is still part of the Diocese of Eichstätt today.\n\nThe village of Monheim came into possession of the \"Graf von Oettingen\", now the House of Oettingen-Wallerstein, around the year 1325. Monheim was awarded its town rights shortly after and the oldest seal of the town dates from 1340. The seal from 1340 already shows the moon, which is still part of the towns crest today. The name \"Monheim\" however does not derive from \"moon\". Until 1821, the crest's colors were red and silver, the colors of the House of Oettingen. Only after 1821 were the current blue and gold adopted.\n\nThe town was fortified, lying at the intersection of the important trade route from Augsburg to Nürnberg, which is nowadays the Bundesstraße 2, and the road from Nördlingen to Neuburg an der Donau. Some of this wall still remains today, including both gates.\n\nThe town remained a possession of Oettingen until the end of the \"Landshut war of succession\" in 1505. Monheim was then handed to the duchy Palatinate-Neuburg (German: \"Pfalz-Neuburg\"), whom it remained with until 1808. The duke Heinrich introduced the Reformation to his lands and Monheim in 1530 and the convent in town was dissolved. Monheim lost its relics and with it much of its religious importance for the region. The convent building was taken down in 1574 but the large Saint Walpurga church, the current building dating from 1509, and some of the convents Romanesque courtyard, dating from the 12th century, remained. The courtyard was fully restored in 1977.\n\nMartin Luther spent a night in Monheim, traveling back from an interrogation in 1518. A large plaque of this notable event remains at the location he stayed.\n\nIn 1614, the Elector Wilhelm reintroduced Catholicism in Palatinate-Neuburg, including Monheim, but the convent was not restored. The Swedish army under the King of Sweden, Gustav Adolf, ransacked Monheim in 1632 during the Thirty Years' War, an event the town took long to recover from.\n\nFrom 1523 onwards, Monheim also became the seat of the county court (German:\"Landgerichtssitz\") for the surrounding region and in 1650 a small palace (German:\"Schloß\") was built for the duke's administrator.\nThe year 1697 saw the first arrival of Jews in Monheim. In 1741, they had to leave the town again, under pressure from the authorities. The current town hall was built by a rich Jewish merchant, the Court Jew Abraham Elias Model, between 1714 and 1720. Model was the chief creditor for the \"Graf von Wallerstein\" at that time. The upper floor of his house originally was thought to have served as the synagogue for the small Jewish community, a fact since disproved, and in 1978 and 1994 the original ceilings, displaying motives from the Old Testament, or Tanakh, were fully restored. The fact that they were covered by a layer of gipsum, which had to be removed, saved them from almost certain destruction by the Nazis. The rooms now serve as the meeting hall for the town council.\n\nThe end of the War of Bavarian Succession in 1779 saw the reunification of Bavaria with Palatinate-Neuburg and Neuburg lost its status as a capital. Monheim was now Bavarian again.\n\nLike most of Bavaria, the age of industrialisation bypassed Monheim and it remained predominantly agricultural. The two world wars saw great personal losses but no real destruction for the town.\n\nDuring the Nazi era, Monheim saw its mayor, Josef Hofmann, replaced with local party leader Albert Königsdorfer. Some of the members of the local council were temporarily taken in \"protective custody\". Resistance to the Nazis was passive, at best. When the figurine of Saint Walpurga on the fountain of the market square was replaced by a more war-like motif in October 1937, the Catholic parish priest, Anton Geitner, an anti-Nazi, refused the Nazi salute and found himself heavily criticised.\n\nLiberation came to Monheim on 24 April 1945, with only limited amounts of fighting taking place. A number of houses in town were shelled and the white flag was raised in town by Matthias Schmied, mayor of Monheim from 1945 to 1947, who was quickly followed in his example by other citizens. In appreciation of the fact that the town survived the war with such little damage, the local town council degreed that a church service was to be held annually on the 24 April. Monheim experienced a short occupation of four days before the US soldiers left the town again.\n\nThe post-World War II years saw a growth in small industries in town. The county court was relocated from Monheim in 1957. The reorganisation of communities in Bavaria and Germany between 1972 and 1978 meant that Monheim came in charge of the previously independent surrounding villages, enlarging the town in size and population.\n\n\n\nThe towns mayor is Günther Pfefferer.\n\nAs of 2008, the town council (German:\"Stadtrat\") consists of 16 elected members from the following parties:\n\nThe town largely depends on light industry, with the Hama company being one of the main employers, having relocated from Dresden to Monheim after the second world war.\n\nAgriculture is still an important factor with about half of the surrounding land used for it.\n\nMonheim lies on the \"Bundesstrasse 2\", the \"Federal Road No. 2\". The \"B2\" used to go straight through town until a bypass was built in the early 1990s. The road from Neuburg to Nördlingen, which passes through the outskirts of Monheim, is not a Federal road.\n\nThe nearest train line is nowadays in Fünfstetten, the Augsburg–Nürnberg line. From there, a 5.6 km long side track used to run to Monheim, built in 1905–06, but passenger service was suspended in 1960 and goods services in the 1990s. During the 1980s, a historic train used to operate on the line on selected summer weekends. Footage of this train was used in the 1983 German movie \"Der Glockenkrieg\".\n\nThe train line has now been completely removed and only the railway station is still in place, now home to the local pigeon breeders club.\n\nThe local sports club, \"TSV Monheim\", has a strong tradition in artistic gymnastics, being one of the centres of the sport in Germany. Its team competes at the highest national level of the sport, often attracting foreign athletes, especially from Brasil. In April 2008, the town hosted a four-nations under-18's tournament with Germany, France, the UK and Switzerland participating.\n\nWarching, one of the neighboring villages, is home to a motocross track and club, the \"MV Warching\", formed in 1973. The club has a strong sidecarcross tradition, having had many of its members race at world championship level. Through Hubert Rebele and Alois Wenninger, the club archived four runners-up spots in this competition in the 1980s and 90's. The track was also the venue for the 1985 German sidecarcross Grand Prix, the only time it was held in Warching.\n\nLike many towns in Bavaria which preserved their old town centre, Monheim hosts a historical \"Town Festival\" (German:\"Historisches Stadtfest\"). Its staged every second year, being held next in July 2014.\n\n'Hortulus Monheimensis' is a florilegium of watercolour sketches commissioned in 1615 by Wolfgang Philippus Brandt, the local governor or magistrate. It is a singular record of the Renaissance garden of the Monheim Palace. The work is hosted by the Bavarian State Library and may have been inspired by the 'Hortus Eystettensis' of 1613. \n\nMonheim lies at the edge of the region of the Solnhofen limestone in what was once the Tethys Ocean. Fossil crocodiles, such as \"Geosaurus\", \"Cricosaurus\", \"Rhacheosaurus\" and \"Steneosaurus\" are all known from quarries near Monheim, while \"Archaeopteryx\" was found in the region around Solnhofen. The Gailach, the little river who runs through Monheim, disappears in the ground to travel underneath the surface shortly after passing Warching and resurfaces in Mühlheim, approximately 4 km further on. The reason for this is the limestone in the region, which makes sinkholes a very common site. A marked trail, the \"Karstlehrpfad Monheimer Alb\" with signs in German explaining the origins of the landscape and the geology.\n\nThe local dialect of the region is Alemannic German, referred to in German as \"Schwäbisch\", with Monheim being at the most northeastern point of its extension. Traveling north, the villages beyond Monheim speak \nEast Franconian German dialects while to the east, Bavarian is spoken.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2230332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230332", "title": "Native American studies", "text": "Native American studies\n\nTwo key concepts shape Native American studies, according to Crow Creek Lakota scholar Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, indigenousness (as defined in culture, geography, and philosophy) and sovereignty (as legally and historically defined). Practitioners advocate for decolonization of indigenous peoples, political autonomy, and the establishment of a discipline dedicated to alleviating contemporary problems facing indigenous peoples.\n\nThe Native historical experience in the Americas is marked by forcible and sometimes willing attempts at assimilation into mainstream European American culture (Americanization). Beginning with missionaries and leading up to federally controlled schools, the aim was to educate American Indians so that they could go back to their communities and facilitate the assimilation process. As cited by David Beck in his article \"American Indian Higher Education before 1974: From Colonization to Self-Determination,\" the schools were used as a tool for assimilation. Their main focus was not intellectual but to give training for industrial jobs or domestic jobs.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s-1960s contested mainstream methods of assimilationist indoctrination and the substance of what was being taught in K-12 schools and universities throughout the United States. American Indian students, coupled with sympathetic professors, assisted in creating new programs with new aims. Rather than being focused on Indians going back to their communities to educate along the lines of assimilation there was a move to educate for empowerment. Programs that did community outreach and focused on student retention in campuses have risen out of that movement. Furthermore, the programs in schools created a new interpretation for American Indian history, sociology, and politics.\n\nDuring the First Convocation of American Indian Scholars in March 1970 at Princeton University, indigenous scholars drafted a plan to develop \"Native American Studies as an Academic Disclipine,\" which would defend indigenous control of their lands and indigenous rights and would ultimately reform US Indian Policy. This discipline would be informed by traditional indigenous knowledge, especially oral history, and would \"defend indigenous nationhood in America.\"\n\nIn direct opposition to Western anthropology, the knowledge base of Native American studies is endogenous, or emerging from within the indigenous communities. Developers of Native American studies widely dismissed the notion of scientific objectivity, since Western cultural biases have historically informed anthropology and other disciplines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2793020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2793020", "title": "Ontario Heritage Act", "text": "Ontario Heritage Act\n\nThe Ontario Heritage Act, (the \"Act\") first enacted on March 5, 1975, allows municipalities and the provincial government to designate individual properties and districts in the Province of Ontario, Canada, as being of cultural heritage value or interest.\n\nOnce a property has been designated under Part IV of the \"Act\", a property owner must apply to the local municipality for a permit to undertake alterations to any of the identified heritage elements of the property or to demolish any buildings or structures on the property.\n\nPart V of the \"Act\" allows for the designation of heritage conservation districts.\n\nUntil 2005, a designation of a property under the \"Act\" allowed a municipality to delay, but not ultimately prevent, the demolition of a heritage property. Heritage advocates were highly critical of the 180-day \"cooling off\" period provided for under the legislation, which was intended to allow time for municipalities and landowners to negotiate an appropriate level of heritage preservation, but often simply resulted in the landowner \"waiting out the clock\" and demolishing the heritage building once the protection of the \"Ontario Heritage Act\" had expired.\n\nIn 2005, the provincial government enacted changes to strengthen the Act. Under the amended legislation, a landowner who is refused a demolition permit under the \"Act\" no longer has an automatic right to demolish a designated building once the cooling off period has expired. Instead, the landowner has the option to appeal the permit refusal to the Conservation Review Board for individual properties or the Ontario Municipal Board for properties within a Heritage Conservation District and the appropriate board would make the final decision on whether or not a demolition permit is issued. Where the OMB refuses to issue a permit, the landowner would have no choice but to preserve the heritage building.\n\nThe amended legislation also contains provisions which enable municipalities to enact by-laws to require owners of designated buildings to maintain the structures and their heritage elements. Such by-laws are intended to prevent \"demolition by neglect\", although the collapse of Walnut Hall in Toronto demonstrates that such buildings are still at risk.\n\nHeritage designation is not universally welcomed. Because it imposes restrictions, or at least delay, on alteration or demolition of protected properties, some owners and would-be developers feel their property rights are compromised. . There is also concern that the restrictions will make it more difficult to sell and/or develop affected properties, with a negative impact on market values.\n\nOttawa: As part of the city’s heritage inventory project, the city is reviewing properties in Old Ottawa East and Old Ottawa South and placing those considered to have “cultural heritage value” on a registry. Owners will be required to give 60 days notice to the city before demolishing a listed property. \n\nRockcliffe Park: The entire village, which is now part of the City of Ottawa, became a Heritage Conservation District in 2016. The objective is not just conservation of individual buildings but of the park-like qualities of the area as a whole. This means that lot sizes, spacings between houses, and streetscapes are also protected; for example, new circular driveways are no longer permitted. There is a current appeal by a home-owner who is also a developer . Pending the outcome of a September 2017 hearing before the Ontario Municipal Board, City of Ottawa policy is to continue to apply the Heritage Conservation Plan.\n\nExperience with the new provisions of the Act has been mixed. Municipalities, who were given significantly greater authority with the amendments, have, in some cases, used the authority to prevent or delay development proposals, with questionable intent. In one case a golf course was designated when the local Council received a proposal to develop it for housing.\n\nAnother flashpoint has been proposals to develop or significantly alter church properties. The government of Ontario has recently published a guideline that provides a context for the inherent conflict between religious beliefs and the civil authority over religious property that is enabled by the Act. The \"Guide to Conserving Heritage Places of Worship in Ontario Communities\" is part of the Ontario Heritage Toolkit.

Much like rentier, it denoted someone who did not have to work to make a living, and who lived off their assets of some size, e.g. interest, profits from investments, real estate and current assets. Sometimes, the title was used by affluent businessmen after they had wholly or largely retired from their former activity. For example, in Thomas Mann's novel \"Buddenbrooks\", the character Alois Permaneder, a former merchant, uses this title after his marriage to Tony Buddenbrook, after receiving a substantial dowry from her wealthy family, at which point he retires from business.\n"}
{"id": "23754317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23754317", "title": "Protohistory of Ireland", "text": "Protohistory of Ireland\n\nIreland can be said to have had a protohistorical period, when, in prehistory, the literate cultures of Greece and Rome began to take notice of it, and a further proto-literate period of ogham epigraphy, before the early historical period began in the 5th century. Attempts have been made to reconstruct the political developments of this period by reference to early medieval Irish genealogical texts.\n\nClassical writers occasionally refer to Ireland under a variety of names, but these references contain little reliable information. For example, Diodorus Siculus claims that the \"Prettanoi\" of the island of \"Iris\" eat human flesh. Strabo, who calls the island \"Ierne\", repeats the accusation, adding that they consider it honourable to eat their dead fathers, and openly have sex with their mothers and sisters (although he is sceptical about his sources). Pomponius Mela calls it \"Iuverna\" and says that, although the climate is unfavourable for grain, grass grows so richly that cattle burst if unrestrained from eating it. Julius Caesar, in his \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\", is the first to call the island \"Hibernia\", describes it as about half the size of Britain, and correctly places it to the west of Britain – unlike Strabo, who places it to the north.\n\nTacitus says that his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola, while governor of Britain (AD 78-85), considered conquering Ireland, believing it could be held with one legion plus auxiliaries, and entertained an exiled Irish petty king with the intention of making him the pretext for conquest. Parallels have been drawn with the Irish legend of Túathal Techtmar, who is said to have been exiled to Britain as a child and returned with an army to claim the kingship of Tara in the 1st century. Tacitus also says that most of the harbours and approaches to Ireland were known through commerce, but inaccurately locates the island between Britain and the Iberian peninsula.\n\nThe 2nd-century poet Juvenal, in his second \"Satire\", contrasting the victories of the Roman army with the low morals of the people at home in Rome, says that, as well as conquering Britain and the Orkney islands, \"we have advanced arms beyond the shores of \"Iuverna\"\". Although Juvenal is not writing history, it is possible that he is referring to a genuine Roman military expedition to Ireland.\n\nThe 2nd-century Alexandrian Greek writer Ptolemy, one of the most important geographers, mathematicians and astronomers in the ancient world, refers to Ireland in two of his works. In the astronomical treatise known as the \"Almagest\" he gives the latitudes of an island he calls \"Mikra Brettania\" (Μικρὰ Βρεττανία) or \"Little Britain\" (the south of the island at 58 degrees, the north at 61 degrees). In his \"Geography\", at the same latitudes, he places the Prettanic island \"Iwernia\", next to its neighbour, the Prettanic island \"Albion\" (Great Britain). The \"Geography\" contains the most detailed account of Ireland in classical literature, giving the latitude and longitude of six promontories, fifteen river mouths, ten settlements and nine islands, and naming sixteen population groups.\n\nPtolemy describes the northern coast of Ireland, from the Northern Promontory (possibly Bloody Foreland or Rossan Point in County Donegal) in the west, to the \"Wenniknion\" promontory (probably Malin Head), the mouth of the river \"Widwa\" (probably the Foyle), the mouth of the river \"Argita\" (perhaps the Bann) and the \"Rhobogdion\" promontory (Fair Head, County Antrim) in the east. The peoples who inhabit the north coast are the \"Wenniknioi\" in the west and the \"Rhobogdioi\" in the east.\n\nThe west coast is poorly represented compared to the other three, and identification of the names Ptolemy gives is speculative. He begins with the Northern Promontory (see above), and working north to south names the river \"Rhawiu\" (possibly the Erne); the town \"Magnata\" (a settlement of the \"Magnatai\" people, possibly somewhere in County Sligo); the mouth of the rivers \"Libniu\" (possiby Clew Bay), \"Ausoba\" (perhaps Galway Bay) \"Senu\" (probably the Shannon, although placed too far to the north), \"Dur\" (possibly Dingle Bay) and \"Iernu\" (possibly the Kenmare), and the Southern Promontory (any one of Slea Head, Bray Head, Dursey Head and Mizen Head). Peoples of this coast are: the \"Erdinoi\" near Donegal Bay; the \"Magnatai\" or \"Nagnatai\" of County Mayo and Sligo; the \"Auteinoi\" between County Galway and the Shannon, identifiable with the early medieval Uaithni; the \"Ganganoi\", also known in north Wales, and the \"Wellaboroi\" in the far south-west.\n\nThe south coast stretches from the Southern Promontory to the mouths of the rivers \"Dabrona\" (possibly the Lee or the Blackwater) and \"Birgu\" (probably the Barrow) and the Sacred Promontory (Carnsore Point, County Wexford). Peoples of the south coast are the \"Iwernoi\" in the west, who share their name with the island, \"Iwernia\", and can be identified with the early medieval Érainn; the \"Usdiai\", and the \"Brigantes\" in the east, who share their name with a people of Roman Britain.\n\nFrom the Sacred Promontory in the south to the \"Rhobogdion\" promontory in the north, Ptolemy names the river \"Modonnu\" (possibly the Slaney, but more likely the Avoca), the town of \"Manapia\" (a settlement of the \"Manapii\"), the river \"Oboka\" (perhaps the Liffey; the river Avoca takes its modern name from a misinterpretation of Ptolemy's \"Oboka\"), the town of \"Eblana\" (a settlement of the \"Eblanoi\", formerly mistakenly identified with Dublin), the river \"Buwinda\" (the Boyne), the promontory \"Isamnion\", the river \"Winderios\" (possibly Carlingford Lough, Dundrum Bay or Strangford Lough), and the river \"Logia\" (Belfast Lough, \"Loch Laoigh\" in Irish). Peoples named, from south to north, are: the \"Koriondoi\"; the \"Manapioi\", possibly related to the Menapii of Gaul; the \"Kaukoi\", probably not related to the Germanic Chauci of the Low Countries; the \"Eblanoi\"; the \"Woluntioi\", identifiable with the early medieval Ulaid; and the \"Darinoi\".\n\nRoman sources mention raids on Britain by Saxons of north-west Germany, by Picts from Scotland and by two groups of people usually associated with Ireland, the Scotti and the Atacotti. The origins and meanings of Scotti and Atacotti is uncertain. Atacotti disappears with the Romans. Scotti means Gaels to Adomnán in the late seventh century, but not to Columbanus in the early sixth century, who uses the older term Iberi instead. The Scotti are perhaps a confederation of tribes in Ulster, and the Atacotti one in Leinster, but this is not certain.\n\n"}

{"id": "32054902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32054902", "title": "Satanazes", "text": "Satanazes\n\nThe island of Satanazes (also called the island of Devils, or of the Hand of Satan or of St. Athanasius) is a legendary island once thought to be located in the Atlantic Ocean, and depicted on many 15th-century maps.\n\nIn 15th-century portolan charts, the island of Satanazes is depicted as lying out in the north Atlantic Ocean, due west of the Azores and Portugal, and just north of the legendary island of Antillia.\n\nThe island was first depicted in the 1424 portolan chart of Venetian cartographer Zuane Pizzigano. It is drawn as a large, blue rectangular island, indented with bays and five or six settlements, with the inscription \"ista ixolla dixemo satanazes\", which has been translated as \"this is the island called of the devils\".\n\nIn his 1424 chart, Pizzigano placed Satanazes some sixty leagues north of the large \"Antillia\" island. Pizzigano capped Satanazes with a little umbrella-shaped island he labels \"Saya\" (which later cartographers will call \"Tanmar\" or \"Danmar\"). These three islands, plus \"Ymana\" (later called \"Royllo\", a little companion west of Antillia), would be collectively drawn together in many later 15th-century maps, with the same relative size, position and shape Pizzigano originally gave them, and known collectively as the \"Antillia group\" or (to use Bianco's label) the \"insulae de novo rep(er)te\" (\"islands newly reported\").\n\nIn Grazioso Benincasa's 1463 atlas, the settlements on Satanazes island are named Araialis, Cansillia, Duchal, Jmada, Nam and Saluaga.\n\nCartographic appearances of Satanazes:\n\nSignificantly, the island of Satanazes is omitted on the maps of Bartolomeo Pareto (1455), Cristoforo Soligo (c. 1475) Grazioso's son Andrea Benincasa (1476) and the Nuremberg globe of Martin Behaim (1492), even though they all include Antillia and some retain \"Saya\"/\"Tanmar\".\n\nSatanazes disappears on practically all maps after Christopher Columbus's voyages of the 1490s. It was possibly transplanted (in smaller form) to the Isle of Demons, between Newfoundland and Greenland, e.g. the 1508 map of Johannes Ruysch.\n\nAccording to Cortesão, Pizzigano's 'Satanazes' is Portuguese for \"satans\" or \"devils\", Beccaria's 'Satanagio' is the same word in Ligurian dialect and Bianco's 'Satanaxio' the same in Venetian. The island disappears from maps after 1436, and reappears only in 1462 when Benincasa switches it to \"Salvaga\", meaning 'savage' – possibly a misreading, more probably a deliberate adjustment by Benincasa to avoid using the profanity of \"devil\". The Laon globe's 'Salirosa' is an apparent mis-transcription of 'Salvaga'.\n\nHistorians have conjectured the \"Devils\" of Satanazes might be a reference to the Skraelings (indigenous peoples of Greenland and Vinland) reported in the Norse sagas, notably the Grœnlendinga saga and the saga of Erik the Red, which began to filter south around this time. Pizzigano may have constructed Satanazes island to capture their rough geographic location.\n\nThe possible connection between the Satanazes and the Skraelings was first proposed by Nordenskiöld (1889), his attention drawn by an inscription on some islands between Newfoundland and Greenland in the 1508 map of Johannes Ruysch, which notes how 'devils' located there attacked sailors (See Isle of Demons). The connection need not require direct knowledge of the Norse sagas themselves, e.g. Fridtjof Nansen has drawn attention to how Norse encounters with North American 'demons' were adopted in Irish \"immrama\". Given the tendency of the legends of Atlantic seafarers – Norse, Irish, Arab and Iberian – to move quickly and cross-fertilize each other, the news of an Isle of Devils out in the North Atlantic may have arrived to Italian cartographers via several channels.\n\nGeorg Hassel conjectured that, by their size and shape, the large islands of Satanazes and Antillia may represent the coasts of North America and South America respectively, thus making it a possible testament of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. Babcock conjectures the representation might be of the Caribbean, that Satanazes represents Florida (and Antillia Cuba, Roylla Jamaica and Tanmar the Bahamas)\nAndrea Bianco's 1436 long label \"Ya de la man santanaxio\" provoked Vicenzo Formaleoni (1783) to read it as the isle of \"the Hand of Satan\", an alternative name for Satanazes still found in some sources. Formaleoni proposed it might be connected to a legend from India, about a giant hand that arose each day from the sea and carried off the inhabitants into the ocean. This legend is told in the \"Perigrinaggio di tre giovani\" (\"The Three Princes of Serendip\") first published in Venice in 1557 by Michele Tramezzino (alleged to be a translation from the Persian of a certain Christopher of Armenia, \"Christoforo Armeno\"). The story might have been circulating earlier among Atlantic Ocean seafarers, traced in Irish immrama and Arab tales, about a giant hand in the Sea of Darkness that plucked sailors and sometimes entire boats, and dragged them to the bottom of the ocean. Gaffarel suggests this might be a reference to the icebergs of the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Marquis d'Avezac (1845) launched yet another theory, reading 'satanaxio' as \"S. Atanaxio\", i.e. the island of St. Athanasius. D'Avezac also makes the credible argument that the \"de la man satanaxio\" in Bianco's label is actually referencing two separate islands, Satanazes and \"Delaman\", probably the nearby \"Danmar\" or \"Tanmar\" of other maps, believed to be a reference to the legendary Isle of Mam (Babcock proposed an alternate reading of Delaman/Danmar/Tanmar as \"I la Mar\", or \"Island of the Sea\".)\n\nThe discovery of the 1424 Pizzigano map in the 20th century, with its \"Satanazes\" clearly indicated, has allowed modern historians to set aside the old Hand of Satan/St. Athanasius theories, and embrace the Isle of Devils reading.\n\nDespite all these conjectures, there is little agreement. Unlike its southern counterpart Antillia (which seems rather solidly connected to the Iberian legend of the Seven Cities), Satanazes has been characterized as a legendary island in need of a legend.\n\n"}

His major work was in the fields of political sociology, trade union organization, social stratification, public opinion, and the sociology of intellectual life. He also wrote extensively about the conditions for democracy in comparative perspective. A socialist in his early life, Lipset later moved to the right, and became one of the first American neoconservatives.\n\nAt his death in 2006, \"The Guardian\" called him \"the leading theorist of democracy and American exceptionalism\"; \"The New York Times\" said he was \"a pre-eminent sociologist, political scientist and incisive theorist of American uniqueness\"; and the \"Washington Post\" said he was \"one of the most influential social scientists of the past half century.\"\n\nLipset was born in Harlem, New York City, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants. His family urged him to become a dentist.\n\nHe grew up in the Bronx among Irish, Italian and Jewish youth. \"I was in that atmosphere where there was a lot of political talk,\" Lipset recalled, \"but you never heard of Democrats or Republicans; the question was communists, socialists, Trotskyists, or anarchists. It was all sorts of different left wing groups.\" Seymour was active in the Young People's Socialist League, an organization of young Trotskyists. He graduated from City College of New York, where he was an anti-Stalinist leftist, and later became National Chairman of the Young People's Socialist League. He received a PhD in sociology from Columbia University in 1949. Before that he taught at the University of Toronto.\n\nLipset was the Caroline S.G. Munro Professor of Political Science and Sociology and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and then became the George D. Markham Professor of Government and Sociology at Harvard University. He also taught at Columbia University, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Toronto, and George Mason University where was the Hazel Professor of Public Policy.\n\nLipset was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was the only person to have been President of both the American Political Science Association (1979–80) and the American Sociological Association (1992–93). He also served as the President of the International Society of Political Psychology, the Sociological Research Association, the World Association for Public Opinion Research, the Society for Comparative Research, and the Paul F. Lazarsfeld Society in Vienna.\n\nBesides making substantial contributions to cleavage theory, with his partner Stein Rokkan, Lipset was one of the first proponents of the \"theory of modernization\", which states that democracy is the direct result of economic growth, and that “[t]he more well-to-do a nation, the greater the chances that it will sustain democracy.” Lipset's modernization theory has continued to be a significant factor in academic discussions and research relating to democratic transitions.\n\nLipset received the MacIver Prize for \"Political Man\" (1960) and, in 1970, the Gunnar Myrdal Prize for \"The Politics of Unreason\".\n\nIn 2001, Lipset was named among the top 100 American intellectuals, as measured by academic citations, in Richard Posner's book, \"Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline.\"\n\nLipset left the Socialist Party in 1960 and later described himself as a centrist, deeply influenced by Alexis de Tocqueville, George Washington, Aristotle, and Max Weber. He became active within the Democratic Party's conservative wing, and was one of the 'original neoconservatives', a small group of public intellectuals who were the first to be called neoconservatives.\n\nLipset was vice-chair of the board of directors of the United States Institute of Peace, a board member of the Albert Shanker Institute, a member of the US Board of Foreign Scholarships, co-chair of the Committee for Labor Law Reform, co-chair of the Committee for an Effective UNESCO, and consultant to the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Humanities Institute, the National Endowment for Democracy, and the American Jewish Committee.\n\nLipset was a strong supporter of the state of Israel, and was President of the American Professors for Peace in the Middle East, chair of the National B'nai B'rith Hillel Commission and the Faculty Advisory Cabinet of the United Jewish Appeal, and co-chair of the Executive Committee of the International Center for Peace in the Middle East. He worked for years on seeking solution for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as part of his larger project of research on the factors that allow societies to sustain stable and peaceful democracies. His work focused on the way in which high levels of socioeconomic development created the preconditions for democracy (see also Amartya Sen's work), and the consequences of democracy for peace.\n\nLipset's book \"The First New Nation\" was a finalist for the National Book Award. He was also awarded the Townsend Harris and Margaret Byrd Dawson Medals for significant achievement, the Northern Telecom-International Council for Canadian Studies Gold Medal, and the Leon Epstein Prize in Comparative Politics by the American Political Science Association. He received the Marshall Sklare Award for distinction in Jewish studies and, in 1997, he was awarded the Helen Dinnerman Prize by the World Association for Public Opinion Research.\n\nLipset's first wife, Elsie, died in 1987.

The tell was inhabited from the 10th millennium BCE, and has been called \"the oldest town in the world\", with many significant archaeological finds; the site is also notable for its role in the history of Levantine archaeology.\n\nThe first permanent settlement on the site developed between 10,000 and 9000 BCE. During the Younger Dryas period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, Tell es-Sultan was a popular camping ground for Natufian hunter-gatherer groups due to the nearby Ein as-Sultan spring; these hunter-gatherers left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them. Around 9600 BCE the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas stadial came to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement. Epipaleolithic construction at the site appears to predate the invention of agriculture, with the construction of Natufian structures beginning earlier than 9000 BC, the very beginning of the Holocene epoch in geologic history.\n\nThe Pre-Pottery Neolithic A phase at Tell es-Sultan (ca. 8500 – 7500 BCE) saw the emergence of one of the world's first major proto-cities. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed \"Pre-Pottery Neolithic A\" (abbreviated as PPNA), sometimes called the Sultanian era after the town. PPNA villages are characterized by small circular dwellings, burial of the dead under the floor of buildings, reliance on hunting wild game, the cultivation of wild or domestic cereals, and no use of pottery yet.\n\nThe PPNA-era town, a settlement of around , contained round mud-brick houses, yet no street planning. Circular dwellings were built of clay and straw bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about across, and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.\n\nThe identity and number of the inhabitants of Jericho during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates going as high as 2000–3000, and as low as 200–300. It is known that this population had domesticated emmer wheat, barley and pulses and hunted wild animals.\n\nThe town was surrounded by a massive stone wall over high and wide at the base (see Wall of Jericho), inside of which stood a stone tower (see Tower of Jericho), placed in the centre of the west side of the tell. This tower was the tallest structure in the world until the Pyramid of Djoser, and the second-oldest tower after the one at Tell Qaramel. The wall and tower were built around 8000 BCE. For the tower carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that it was built around 8300 BCE and stayed in use until ca. 7800 BC. The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, thus suggesting some kind of social organization and division of labour.\n\nThe major structures highlight the importance of the Tell for the understanding of settlement patterns in the Sultanian period in the southern Levant.\n\nAfter a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features. These represent either teraphim or an early example of portraiture in art history, and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.\n\nThe architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bounding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room ( and ) with internal divisions, the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish terrazzo-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.\n\nKathleen Kenyon interpreted one building as a shrine. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fit into this niche.\n\nThe dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; cowries were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in Tell Ramad and Beisamoun as well.\n\nOther finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, burins, scrapers, a few tranchet axes, obsidian, and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also querns, hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.\n\nA succession of settlements followed from 4500 BCE onward, the largest constructed in 2600 BCE.\n\nTell es-Sultan was continually occupied into the Middle Bronze Age; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.\n\nDuring the Middle Bronze Age Tell es-Sultan was a small prominent city of the Canaan region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the Maryannu, a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the Mitannite state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported \"...the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period\" and there was \"a massive stone revetment... part of a complex system\" of defenses (pp. 213–218). The Bronze-Age city fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530 BCE. Notably this carbon dating 1573 BCE confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating 1550 by Kenyon.\n\nTell es-Sultan remained unoccupied from the end of the 15th to the 10th-9th centuries BCE, when the city was rebuilt. Of this new city not much more remains than a four-room house on the eastern slope. By the 7th century Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in the late 6th century.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late 6th century, whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the Restoration after the Babylonian captivity, left only very few remains. The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period.\n\nThe first excavations of the site were made by Charles Warren in 1868 at the request of the Palestine Exploration Fund. He dug through the mud bricks of the wall without realizing what it was, suggesting there was little of interest at the site.\n\nErnst Sellin and Carl Watzinger excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907–1909 and in 1911, finding the remains of two walls which they initially suggested supported the biblical account of the Battle of Jericho. They later revised this conclusion and dated their finds to the Middle Bronze Age (1950-1550 BC).\n\nThe site was again excavated by John Garstang between 1930 and 1936, who again raised the suggestion that remains of the upper wall was that described in the Bible, and dated to around 1400 BCE.\n\nExtensive investigations using more modern techniques were made by Kathleen Kenyon between 1952 and 1958. Her excavations discovered a tower and wall in trench I. Kenyon provided evidence that both constructions dated much earlier than previous estimates of the site's age, to the Neolithic, and were part of an early proto-city. Her excavations found a series of seventeen early Bronze Age walls, some of which she thought may have been destroyed by earthquakes. The last of the walls was put together in a hurry, indicating that the settlement had been destroyed by nomadic invaders. Another wall was built by a more sophisticated culture in the Middle Bronze Age with a steep plastered escarpment leading up to mud bricks on top.\n\nLorenzo Nigro and Nicolo Marchetti conducted excavations in 1997-2000. Since 2009 the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome \"La Sapienza\" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH under the direction of Lorenzo Nigro and Hamdan Taha.\n\nThe PPNA-era city wall was designed for either defensive or flood protection purposes; the height of the wall (approximately thick and high) as well as that of the tower suggests a defensive purpose as well. It is suggested to date to approximately 8000 BC. If interpreted as an \"urban fortification\", the Wall of Jericho is the oldest city wall discovered by archaeologists anywhere in the world. Surrounding the wall was a ditch wide by deep, cut through solid bedrock with a circumference of around the town of as much as .\n\nThe Tower of Jericho is an stone structure, built in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A period around 8000 BCE. It is among the earliest stone monuments of mankind. Conical in shape, the tower is almost in diameter at the base, decreasing to at the top, with walls approximately thick. It contains an internal staircase with 22 stone steps. The construction of the tower is estimated to have taken 11,000 working days. Recent studies by Ran Barkai from Tel Aviv University and Roy Liran have suggested astronomical and social, rather than military, purposes in the construction of the tower.\n"}

{"id": "4799746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4799746", "title": "Urban history", "text": "Urban history\n\nUrban history is a field of history that examines the historical nature of cities and towns, and the process of urbanization. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like social history, architectural history, urban sociology, urban geography, business history, and archaeology. Urbanization and industrialization were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of modernization, or the transformation of rural traditional societies.\n\nThe history of urbanization focuses on the processes of by which existing populations concentrate themselves in urban localities over time, and on the social, political, cultural and economic contexts of cities. Most urban scholars focus on the \"metropolis,\" a large or especially important city. There is much less attention to small cities, towns or (until recently) to suburbs. However social historians find small cities much easier to handle because they can use census data to cover or sample the entire population. In the United States from the 1920s to the 1990s many of the most influential monographs began as one of the 140 PhD dissertations at Harvard University directed by Arthur Schlesinger, Sr. (1888-1965) or Oscar Handlin (1915-2011). The field grew rapidly after 1970, leading one prominent scholar, Stephan Thernstrom, to note that urban history apparently deals with cities, or with city-dwellers, or with events that transpired in cities, with attitudes toward cities – which makes one wonder what is \"not\" urban history.\n\nOnly a handful of studies attempt a global history of cities, notably Lewis Mumford, \"The City in History\" (1961). Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, \"The European City\" (1993); Christopher R. Friedrichs, \"The Early Modern City, 1450-1750\" (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. \"Edo and Paris\" (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).\n\nArchitectural history is its own field, but occasionally overlaps with urban history.\n\nThe political role of cities in helping state formation—and in staying independent—is the theme of Charles Tilly and W. P. Blockmans, eds., \"Cities and the Rise of States in Europe, A.D. 1000 to 1800\" (1994). Comparative elite studies—who was in power—are typified by Luisa Passerini, Dawn Lyon, Enrica Capussotti and Ioanna Laliotou, eds. \"Who Ran the Cities? City Elites and Urban Power Structures in Europe and North America, 1750-1940\" (2008) . Labor activists and socialists often had national or international networks that circulated ideas and tactics.\n\nIn the 1960s, the historiography of Victorian towns and cities began to flourish in Britain. Much attention focused first on the Victorian city, with topics ranging from demography, public health, the working-class, and local culture. In recent decades, topics regarding class, capitalism, and social structure gave way to studies of the cultural history of urban life, as well as the study of groups such as women, prostitutes, migrants from rural areas, and immigrants from the Continent and from the British Empire. The urban environment itself became a major topic, as studies of the material fabric of the city, and the structure of urban space, became more prominent.\n\nHistorians have almost always focused on London, but they have also studied small towns and cities from the medieval period, as well as the urbanization that attended the industrial revolution. In the second half of the 19th century, provincial centers such as Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, and Manchester doubled in size, and became regional capitals. They were all conurbations that included smaller cities and suburbs in their catchment area. Available scholarly materials have become quite comprehensive today.\n\nUrban biography is the narrative history of a city, and often reaches a general audience. Urban biographies cover the interrelationships among various dimensions, such as politics, demography, business, high culture, popular culture, housing, neighborhoods, and ethnic groups. It covers municipal government as well as physical expansion, growth and decline. Historians often focus on the largest and most dominant city—usually the national capital—which geographers call a \"primate city.\"\n\nSome representative urban biographies are:\n\nHistorians have developed typologies of cities, emphasizing their geographic location and economic specialization. In the United States Carl Bridenbaugh was a pioneer in the historiography. He emphasized the major port cities on the East Coast, the largest of which were Boston and Philadelphia, each with fewer than 40,000 people at the time of the American Revolution. Other historians have covered the port cities up and down the East Coast, the Gulf Coast, and the West Coast, along with the river ports along the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri rivers. Industrialization began in New England, and several small cities have scholarly histories. The railroad cities of the West, stretching from Chicago to Kansas City to Wichita to Denver have been well treated. Blake McKelvey provides an encyclopedic overview of the functions of major cities in \"The Urbanization of America, 1860-1915\" (1963), and \"The Emergence of Metropolitan America, 1915-1966\" (1968)\n\nPeter Clark of the Urban History Center of the University of Leicester was the general editor (and Cambridge University Press the publisher) of a massive history of British cities and towns, running 2800 pages in 75 chapters by 90 scholars. The chapters deal not with biographies of individual cities, but with economic, social or political themes that cities had in common. Two highly influential, authoritative and comprehensive compendia of European urban history were also compiled by Barry Haynes of the Centre for Urban History at Leicester University in 1990 and 1991, published by Leicester University. These books made a significant contribution to the bibliographic review of urban history research and literature in both Eastern and Western Europe.\n\nIn the United States a very different approach was sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities has sponsored large historical encyclopedias for many states and several cities, most notably the Encyclopedia of Chicago (2004; also online edition) and The Encyclopedia of New York City (1995, 2nd ed. 2010) They followed the model of an earlier encyclopedia of Cleveland and relished the details about neighborhoods, people, organizations and events, without imposing any overall theme.\n\nA new subgenre is the history of specific suburbs. Historians have concentrated on specific places, typically focusing on the origins of the suburb in relation to the central city, the pattern of growth, different functions (such as residential or industrial), local politics, as well as racial exclusion and gender roles. The main overview is Kenneth T. Jackson's \"Crabgrass Frontier\" (1987).\n\nMany people have assumed that early-20th-century suburbs were enclaves for middle-class whites, a concept that carries tremendous cultural influence yet is actually stereotypical. Many suburbs are based on a heterogeneous society of working-class and minority residents, many of whom share the American Dream of upward social status via home ownership. Sies (2001) argues that it is necessary to examine how \"suburb\" is defined as well as the distinction made between cities and suburbs, geography, economic circumstances, and the interaction of numerous factors that move research beyond acceptance of stereotyping and its influence on scholarly assumptions.\n\nThe \"new urban history\" emerged in the 1960s as a branch of Social history seeking to understand the \"city as process\" and, through quantitative methods, to learn more about the inarticulate masses in the cities, as opposed to the mayors and elites. Much of the attention is devoted to individual behavior, and how the intermingling of classes and ethnic groups operated inside a particular city. Smaller cities are much easier to handle when it comes to tracking a sample of individuals over ten or 20 years.\n\nCommon themes include the social and political changes, examinations of class formation, and racial/ethnic tensions. A major early study was Stephan Thernstrom's \"Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City\" (1964), which used census records to study Newburyport, Massachusetts, 1850-1880. A seminal, landmark book, it sparked interest in the 1960s and 1970s in quantitative methods, census sources, \"bottom-up\" history, and the measurement of upward social mobility by different ethnic groups.\n\nOther exemplars of the new urban history included\n\nThere were no overarching social history theories that emerged developed to explain urban development. Inspiration from urban geography and sociology, as well as a concern with workers (as opposed to labor union leaders), families, ethnic groups, racial segregation, and women's roles have proven useful. Historians now view the contending groups within the city as \"agents\" who shape the direction of urbanization. The sub-field has flourished in Australia—where most people live in cities.\n\nDemographic perspectives make use of the large volume of census data from the mid-19th century.\n\nRather than being strictly areas of geographical segmentation, spatial patterns and concepts of place reveal the struggles for power of various social groups, including gender, class, race, and ethnic identity. The spatial patterns of residential and business areas give individual cities their distinct identities and, considering the social aspects attendant to the patterns, create a more complete picture of how those cities evolved, shaping the lives of their citizens.\n\nNew techniques include the use of historical GIS data.\n\nSince the 1980s extensive research has been done of the cities of the Ottoman Empire, where standardized record keeping and centralized archives have facilitated work on Aleppo, Damascus, Byblos, Sidon, Jericho, Hama, Nablus and Jerusalem. Historians have explored the social bases of political factionalism, histories of elites and commoners, different family structures and gender roles, marginalized groups such as prostitutes and slaves, and relationships between Muslims and Christians and Jews. Increasingly work is underway on African cities,\nas well as South Asia.\n\nIn China the Maoist ideology privileged the uprising of the peasants as the central force in Chinese history, which led to a neglect of urban history until the 1980s. Academics were then allowed to assert that peasant rebellions were often reactionary rather than revolutionary, and that China's modernizers of the 1870s made significant advances, even if they were capitalists.\n\nFor over a century—since Heinrich Schliemann searched for and found ancient Troy—archaeologists and ancient historians have studies the cities of the ancient world.\n\nThe study of the culture of specific cities and the role of cities in shaping national culture is a more recent development which provides nontraditional ways of \"reading\" cities. A representative class is Carl E. Schorske, \"Fin-De-Siecle Vienna: Politics and Culture\" (1980). The basis for some of this approach stems from a post-modern theory including the cultural anthropology of Clifford Geertz. One example is Alan Mayne's \"The Imagined Slum: Newspaper Representation in Three Cities, 1870-1914\"(1993), a study of how slums were represented in the newspapers in Sydney, San Francisco, and Birmingham. The accounts provided dramatic life stories but failed to integrate the agendas and animosities of city officials, property owners, residents, and local businessmen. As a result, they did not reveal the true inner-city social structures. Nevertheless, the middle class accepted the image of and decided to act on the social constructions, leading to the reformers' demands for slum clearance and urban renewal.\n\nAs Rosen and Tarr point out, environmental history has made great strides since the 1970s, but its focus is primarily on rural areas, leading to a neglect of urban issues such as air pollution, sewage, clean water—and the concentration of large numbers of horses. Historians are beginning to integrate urban history and environmental history. Thus far most of the attention concerns the negative impact on the environment, rather than how the environment shaped the urbanization process.\n\nIn literature the city has long stood as one of the most potent symbols of human capacities and nature. As the largest and most enduring creation of human imagination and hands, and as the largest and most sustained site of human association and interaction, the city has been seen as a marker of what humans are and of what they do. This signification has almost always been shaded with ambivalence. In old legends, epics, and utopias, cities (both actual and symbolic) appeared as places of exceptional but also contradictory meaning. The histories of Troy, Babel, Sodom, Babylon, and Rome were viewed, in Western cultures, as standing for human power, wisdom, creativity, and vision, but also for human presumption, perversion, and fated destruction. Images of the modern city restated this ambivalence with fresh intensity. Great modern cities like London, Paris, Berlin, and New York, have repeatedly been portrayed as sites of opportunity and peril, power and helplessness, vitality and decadence, creativity and perplexity. This contradictory face of the city has appeared so often in Western thought as to suggest an essential psychological and cultural anxiety about human civilization, an anxiety about humanity’s relation to their created world and about \"humanity\" itself. This is especially true of the “modern” city, filled with human artifice and moral contradiction.\n\nThe Journal of Urban History has been a leading quarterly journal with articles and reviews since 1975. The Urban History Association was founded in 1988 with 284 members; it now has over 400. It sponsored the \"Sixth Biennial Urban History Association Conference\" in New York, October 25–28, 2012. It awards prizes for the best book prize, best article, and best PhD dissertation.\n\nH.J. Dyos (1921-1978) at the University of Leicester was the leading promoter of urban history in Britain, leading the way especially into the study of Victorian cities. He formed the Urban History Study Group in 1962; its newsletter became the \"Urban History Yearbook\" (1974-1991) and then the journal \"Urban History\" (1992–present). His edited volume on \"The Study of Urban History\" (1968) opened up the methodology and stimulated young scholars, as did the conferences he organized and the book series he edited. Dyos rejected the quantitative methods of the New Urban History because he was not interested in the individual people in the city, but in the larger social structure, such as the slum or the entire city.\n\nSince 1993, the daily email discussion list H-Urban has enabled historians, graduate students and others interested in urban history and urban studies to communicate current research and research interests easily; to query and discuss new approaches, sources, methods, and tools of analysis; and to comment on contemporary historiography. The logs are open to searches, and membership is free. H-Urban seeks to inform historians on such matters as announcements, calls for papers, conferences, awards, fellowships, availability of new sources and archives, reports on new research, and teaching tools, including books, articles, works-in-progress, research reports, primary historical documents (for example, model ordinances, federal/state/local reports, addresses of city officials), syllabi, bibliographies, software, datasets, and multimedia publications or projects. It commissions its own book reviews. H-Urban has 2,856 subscribers (as of 2012) and is the oldest of the H-Net network of discussion lists.\n\n\n"}
