{"id": "2332880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332880", "title": "Alice Cunningham Fletcher", "text": "Alice Cunningham Fletcher\n\nAlice Cunningham Fletcher (March 15, 1838 in HavanaApril 6, 1923 in Washington, D.C.) was an American ethnologist, anthropologist, and social scientist who studied and documented American Indian culture.\n\nNot much is known about Fletcher's parents; her father was a New York lawyer and her mother was from a prominent Boston family. Her parents moved to Havana, Cuba in vain hopes of easing her father's illness with a better climate. Fletcher was born there in 1838. After her father died in 1839, the family moved to Brooklyn Heights, Fletcher was enrolled in the Brooklyn Female Academy, an exclusive school for the elite. Fletcher taught school and later became a public lecturer to support herself, arguing that anthropologists and archaeologists were best at uncovering ancient history of humans. She also advocated for the education of Native Americans \"so that they could gain accoutrements of civilization.\"\n\nFletcher credited Frederic Ward Putnam for stimulating her interest in American Indian culture and began working with him at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University.\nShe studied the remnants of the Indian civilization in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, and became a member of the Archaeological Institute of America in 1879.\n\nFrom 1881, Fletcher was involved with the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, where native children learned English, arithmetic, and skills designed to allow them to be integrated American citizens.\n\nIn 1881, Fletcher made an unprecedented trip to live with and study the Sioux on their reservation as a representative of the Peabody Museum. She was accompanied by Susette \"Bright Eyes\" La Flesche, an Omaha spokeswoman who had served as interpreter for Standing Bear in 1879 in his landmark civil rights trial. Also with them was Thomas Tibbles, a journalist who had helped publicize Standing Bear's cause and arranged a several-month lecture tour in the United States.\n\nThese times also marked the beginning of Fletcher's 40-year association with Francis La Flesche, Susette's half brother. They collaborated professionally and had an informal mother-son relationship. They shared a house in Washington, D.C., beginning in 1890.\n\nIn addition to her research and writing, Fletcher worked in several special appointed positions during the late nineteenth century. In 1883 she was appointed special agent by the US to allot lands to the \"Miwok\" tribes, in 1884 she prepared and sent to the World Cotton Centennial an exhibit showing the progress of civilization among the Indians of North America in the quarter-century previous, and in 1886 visited the natives of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands on a mission from the commissioner of education. In 1887 she was appointed United States special agent in the allotment of lands among the Winnebago and the Nez Perce under the Dawes Act.\n\nShe was made assistant in ethnology at the Peabody Museum in 1882, and in 1891 received the Thaw fellowship, which was created for her. Active in professional societies, she was elected president of the Anthropological Society of Washington and in 1905 as the first woman president of the American Folklore Society. She also served as vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and was a longtime member of the Literary Society of Washington.\n\nWorking through the Women's National Indian Association, Fletcher introduced a system of making small loans to Indians, wherewith they might buy land and houses. She also helped secure a loan for Susan LaFlesche, an Omaha woman, to enable her studies at medical school. Graduating at the top of her class, LaFlesche became the first Native American woman doctor in the United States.\n\nLater Fletcher helped write, lobbied for and helped administer the Dawes Act of 1887, which broke up reservations and distributed communal land in allotments for individual household ownership of land parcels.\n\nIn 1888 Fletcher published \"Indian Education and Civilization\", a special report of the Bureau of Education. She was a pioneer in the study of American Indian music, a field of research inaugurated by a paper she gave in 1893 before the Chicago Anthropological Conference. In 1898 at the Congress of Musicians held in Omaha during the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, she read several essays upon the songs of the North American Indians. A number of Omaha Indians sang their native melodies. Out of this grew her \"Indian Story and Song from North America\" (1900), exploring a stage of development antecedent to that in which culture music appeared.\n\nFletcher worked with Frederic Ward Putnam in his research on Serpents Mound in Ohio and assisted in the efforts to raise funds to purchase the site in 1886. The site was donated to the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society in 1900 and is a National Historic Landmark.\n\nIn 1930, Margaret Mead started work with the Omaha, and decided to concentrate on the modern aspects of the tribe, because of the extensive work already done by Alice Fletcher.\n\nOver her lifetime Alice Fletcher worked with and for the Omaha, Pawnee, Sioux, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Chippewa, Oto, Nez Perc√©, Ponca and Winnebago tribes.\n\nAlice Fletcher helped write and pass the Dawes Act of 1887. This act imposed a system of private land ownership on Indigenous tribes. This was a big difference because traditionally these tribes had communal land ownership. Individual Indigenous peoples would be allotted up to 160 acres of land. This land was tax-free and was to be held in trust by the government for a period of 25 years. At the time, she thought it would enable American Indians to assimilate to European-American ways, as their best means of survival. The government also wanted to gain \"surplus\" land for sale to other Americans. The Dawes Act was accountable for the inevitable breakup of all Indigenous reservations. By 1932 the amount of land acquired was approximately 92,000,000 of the 138,000,000 acres Indigenous groups had owned in 1887. Fletcher's land allotment work has been viewed as an error in the administration policies of Native American peoples and their land. Fletcher herself may have even realized this error because she abandoned her political policy work to focus strictly on more ethnographical work after the turn of the century.\n\nFletcher wrote about the experiences of her 1881 field trip in two journals. These journals included drawings of the plains, reservations, and many of her different campsites throughout eastern Nebraska and South Dakota. Even though many of her writings regarding the Sioux would seem rather insensible by contemporary anthropological standards, \"Her writings reflect the attitudes regarding the movement of history and social evolution prevalent in her day\".\n\nIn 1911, with Francis La Flesche, she published \"The Omaha Tribe\". It is still considered to be the definitive work on the subject. Altogether she wrote 46 monographs on ethnology. In 1908 she led in founding the School of American Archaeology in Santa Fe, New Mexico. From 1899 until 1916 Fletcher was on the editorial board of the American Anthropologist, and she also made major contributions to many issues. Fletcher was a pioneer in the study of Native American music. She became fascinated by their music and dancing so she transcribed hundreds of their songs. In 1898 she presented several essays on the subject of Native American songs at the Congress of Musicians in Omaha. From these essays eventually came her books \"Indian Story and Song from North America\" and \"The Hako: A Pawnee Ceremony\".\n\nAlice Fletcher received numerous honours for the work she accomplished throughout her career. In 1890 she was awarded the Margaret Copley Thaw Fellowship at Harvard, which granted her funding for ethnographic and reform work. Fletcher also became President of the Anthropological Society of Washington in 1903 and the first woman President of the American Folklore Society in 1905. One of her colleagues, Walter Hough, remembered Fletcher as one who, \"Mildly, peaceably, yet with great fortitude...did what she could to advance the cause of science\". Her ashes are interned in the patio wall of the New Mexico Museum of Art behind a bronze plaque with a quote from her.\n\nSun Dance of the Ogallala Sioux.

{"id": "5681404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5681404", "title": "American Shakespeare Center", "text": "American Shakespeare Center\n\nThe American Shakespeare Center (ASC) is a regional theatre company located in Staunton, Virginia, that focuses on the plays of William Shakespeare; his contemporaries Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Christopher Marlowe; and works related to Shakespeare, like James Goldman's \"The Lion in Winter\" and Bob Carlton's \"Return to the Forbidden Planet.\"\n\nThe ASC is notable for its theatre, the Blackfriars Playhouse, the world's first recreation of the original indoor Blackfriars Theatre in London that was demolished in 1655. As a theater company, the ASC hosts performances by two rotating ensembles of 16 different titles in 5 distinct seasons, 52 weeks a year, at its Blackfriars Playhouse, as well as hosting a regional travelling company, ASC on Tour. The ASC also provides a year-round laboratory for students and scholars through education programming in Staunton and on the road.\n\nThe American Shakespeare Center was founded as the Shenandoah Shakespeare EXPRESS in 1988 by Dr. Ralph Alan Cohen and Jim Warren. The first show performed by the newly organized company was \"Richard III,\" where actors who made up the locally travelling ensemble troupe came from James Madison University's current students and graduates, and the performance was two hours long (compared to a more typical three hour plus run time).\n\nIn 1990, the company started performing multiple shows in rotating repertory with a season of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"Julius Caesar.\" Shenandoah Shakespeare Express grew quickly during its first five years, moving from a single touring show in Virginia in 1988 to a three-show tour in 1992 that included the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., and an overseas leg in London and Edinburgh. Three years later, the company toured the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, and Scotland as well as starting to build the Education arm of the company with a six-week National Endowment for the Humanities institute.\n\nIn 1997, the Shenandoah Shakespeare Express introduced the Young Company Theatre Camp, a three-week intensive summer program for high school students.\n\nShenandoah Shakespeare Express changed its name to Shenandoah Shakespeare in 1999 and moved to Staunton, Virginia.\n\nIn September 2001, the Blackfriars Playhouse ‚Äì the world's first re-creation of Shakespeare's indoor theatre ‚Äì opened in Staunton, Virginia and ASC Education hosted its first Blackfriars Conference.\n\nIn 2014, another replica of the Blackfriars theatre, called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, was opened in London.\n\nIn 2005, Shenandoah Shakespeare changed its name to the American Shakespeare Center to reflect its focus on being a center for performance and research. Also in 2005, the first Actors' Renaissance Season debuted. The Actors' Renaissance Season uses Shakespeare's rehearsal conditions (self-directed, self-designed, short rehearsal period) as well as his staging conditions to delve deeper into the plays. The Actors' Renaissance Season is also an opportunity to explore rarer titles of the early modern period.\n\nIn 2005, the Bob Carlton musical, \"Return to the Forbidden Planet,\" which was loosely based on Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\" and the science-fiction classic movie from the late 1950s, \"Forbidden Planet,\" was produced by the touring company, then called the Blackfriars Stage Company. The performances incorporated acoustic music, a piano, and a three-sided thrust stage, all of which were selected to maximize audience engagement.\n\nThe American Shakespeare Center celebrated its 25th Anniversary in 2013.\n\nIn April 2017, the American Shakespeare Center launched an international playwrighting competition to develop a canon of new plays that are inspired by and in conversation with the work of William Shakespeare. Each new play will be performed in rotating repertory with the Shakespeare play it corresponds with. The first round of submissions are for \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\"; \"Henry IV, Part 1\"; \"The Comedy of Errors\"; and \"The Winter's Tale\". \n\nIn Staunton, the ASC constructed the Blackfriars Playhouse, the first modern re-creation of Shakespeare's original indoor theatre, the Blackfriars Theatre. As no reliable plans of that theatre are known, architect Tom McLaughlin based the design on plans for other 17th-century theatres, his own trips to England to view surviving halls of the period, Shakespeare's stage directions and other research and consultation. The chosen dimensions of by were derived from the research of theatre historian Irwin Smith.\n\nConstruction began on the playhouse in early 2000, as part of a three-building construction plan that would also include a re-creation of the 1614 Globe Theatre and a Center for Research and Education. The theater was built with timber sourced by Dreaming Creek.\n\nThe playhouse was completed at a cost of $3.7 million, and opened in September 2001. Built inside a brick shell, it is a wood-pegged, post-and-beam structure, made of Virginia oak, with a hammerbeam roof. The seating capacity is 300. Raked benches in a pit and two levels of galleries place the audience close to the actors, and even seating on the stage is possible. Unlike the original Blackfriars, the theatre has no painted decorations except at the back of the stage, and no windows in the auditorium. Electrical lighting reflected off the ceiling is used to simulate daylight, and lights simulating candles are mounted on sconces, and on wrought-iron chandeliers.\n\nIn 2012, the Blackfriars Playhouse appeared in BBC's documentary \"Shakespeare Uncovered,\" which aired in the U.S. in early 2013.\n\nThe American Shakespeare Center gives its audiences some of the same experiences that an Elizabethan playgoer would have enjoyed by following the basic principles of Renaissance theatrical production - including Universal Lighting (audience and actors share the same pool of light), Doubling (one actor playing multiple roles in a show), cross-gender casting (men playing female characters and vice versa), and minimal sets.\n\nFor resident theatre companies, according to Zelda Fichandler, \"repertory is destiny\" - a theatre company acquires its audience by the productions it presents. Most of the production at the American Shakespeare Center's are from Shakespeare's canon; however, each year several productions are works by his contemporary playwrights or more modern plays that relate directly to the Shakespeare canon or work well using Shakespeare's staging conditions.\n\nASC Education offers workshops, performances, staged readings, lectures, a biennial international conference, teacher training, archival materials for scholarly research, and summer programs for teens and adults.\n\nThe ASC partners with Mary Baldwin University in the one-of-a-kind MLitt/MFA Shakespeare and Performance graduate program for actors, directors, teachers, and dramaturgs. The program's graduates have gone on to doctoral work, tenure-track faculty positions, and professional theatre careers.\n\nAdministration\n\nAdvisory Board\n\nIn 2008, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine honored American Shakespeare Center co-founders Jim Warren and Ralph Alan Cohen with the Governor's Awards for the Arts. \n\nOn September 12, 2013, the Staunton, Virginia City Council passed a resolution honoring the 25th Anniversary of the American Shakespeare Center, acknowledging its growth from a touring troupe performing \"Richard III\" fourteen times in rural Virginia into an international Shakespeare center that has:\nShakespeare's Globe awarded American Shakespeare Center co-founder Ralph Alan Cohen with the Sam Wanamaker Award in June 2014. \n\nIn 2015, The Folger Shakespeare Library awarded the American Shakespeare Center with its Shakespeare Steward Award for its contributions in Shakespeare education. \n\nIn 2016, the Arts Council of the Shenandoah Valley awarded the American Shakespeare Center its Circle of Excellence Award. \n\nIn 2017, the Virginia Commission for the Arts named the American Shakespeare Center one of its \"50 for 50 Arts Inspirations\" in the category of Bedrock Institutions. \n\n\n\n"}

Balzer (c.1864‚Äì1940).\n\nStephen Balzer immigrated in the 1870s from the Kingdom of Hungary to the USA. He apprenticed as a watchmaker at Tiffany's. When he started his own business in 1894, a machine shop, he already held several patents for mechanical devices, among them a device for making milling cutters and his rotary engine. In the same year, he completed his first prototype automobile, a motorized \"quadricycle\"with a tube chassis, less than 6¬†ft long and 3¬†ft wide. It had a rotary, air-cooled, 3-cylinder engine, mounted vertically in the rear and revolving around a fixed crankshaft. Turning with the crank case was a stub shaft. It further had a 3-speed manual transmission with no reverse. One lever engaged speeds and clutch. Each front wheel had its own bicycle fork axle which were connected by a bar which was operated by a tiller) By 1897, he had built three cars. \n\nHe developed also 5-cylinder rotary engines. When Smithsonian Institution Secretary Samuel P. Langley learned about these vehicles and their engine in 1898, he contacted Balzer, ordering one for his experimental airplane. Balzer had problems finishing this engine, delivering finally not earlier than 1900. For proper use, Langley's technical assistant, Charles M. Manly had to modify it heavily. Thus, it became the Manly‚ÄìBalzer engine, the first purpose-built aero-engine.\n\nBut his business was not very successful, and he left in 1902. He still worked as a mechanic, and in 1940 he died.\n\nOn May 16, 1899, Balzer donated his prototype to the Smithsonian Institution, the first automobile in its collection. This was the first car given to the Smithsonian. It is currently in collection.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1120754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1120754", "title": "Banu Qasi", "text": "Banu Qasi\n\nThe Banu Qasi, Banu Kasi, Beni Casi (, meaning \"sons\" or \"heirs of Cassius\") or Banu Musa were a Muwallad dynasty that ruled the upper Ebro valley in the 9th century, before being displaced in the first quarter of the 10th century.\n\nThe family is said to descend from the Hispano-Roman or Visigothic nobleman named Cassius. Muslim chronicles and the \"Chronicle of Alfonso III\" suggest he was a Visigoth. According to the 10th century Muwallad historian, Ibn al-Q≈´·π≠iyya, Count Cassius converted to Islam in 714 as the \"mawlƒÅ\" (client) of the Umayyads, shortly after their conquest of Hispania. After his conversion, he is said to have traveled to Damascus to personally swear allegiance to the Umayyad Caliph, Al-Walid I.\n\nUnder the Banu Qasi, the region of Upper Ebro (modern districts of Logro√±o and southern Navarre, based in Tudela) formed a semi-autonomous principality. The tiny emirate was faced by enemies in several directions. Although never realized, the threat of Frankish attempts to regain control over the western Pyrenees was a real one. In actuality, even more menacing was the gradual eastwards expansion of the Asturian Kingdom; while in the south lay the Caliphate of Cordova, ever anxious to impose its authority over the frontier regions.\n\nAs a local Muslim dynasty in the Ebro valley (the Upper March of Al-Andalus; , \"A·πØ-·πÆa·∏°r al-A øl√†\"), the Banu Qasi were nominally clients of the emirate, but they thrived on regional rivalries and alliances with other Muwallad dynasties of the Upper March, the Vascon tribal chieftains of Pamplona and Aragon, as well as with the Catalan counts of Pallars-Ribagorza to the north and Barcelona to the east, the Kingdom of Asturias to the west and the Umayyads to the south over the next two centuries. They frequently intermarried with other regional nobility, both Muslim and Christian. Musa ibn Musa and the Pamplona king √ç√±igo Arista were maternal half-brothers, while Musa also married Arista's daughter, and his own daughter and nieces were married to other Pyrenean princes. The cultural ambivalence of the Banu Qasi is also demonstrated by their mixed use of names: for example, Arabic (\"Muhammad\", \"Musa\", \"Abd Allah\"), Latinate (\"Awriya\", \"Furtun\", \"Lubb\"), and Basque (\"Garshiya\").\n\nThe Umayyads of Cordova sanctioned the rule of the Banu Qasi and repeatedly granted them autonomy by appointing them as governors, only to replace them as they expressed too much independence, or launch punitive military expeditions into the region. Such acts on the part of the Umayyads demonstrated their failure to ever fully resolve the problem of effective, central control of outlying regions.\n\nThe speculated homeland of Count Cassius was a narrow strip across the Ebro from Tudela. The Arab historian Ibn Hazm listed the sons of Count Cassius as \"Furtun\", \"Abu Tawr\", \"Abu Salama\", \"Yunus\" and \"Yahya\". Of these, it has been suggested that the second may be the Abu Tawr, Wali of Huesca, who invited Charlemagne to Zaragoza in 778. Likewise, the Banu Salama, removed from power in Huesca and Barbitanya (the area of Barbastro) at the end of the 8th century, may have derived from Abu Salama. Subsequent leaders of the family descend from the eldest son, Furtun. His son, Musa ibn Furtun ibn Qasi, first garnered notice in 788, when on behalf of emir Hisham I of C√≥rdoba he put down the rebellion of the Banu Husain in Zaragoza. The fate of Musa ibn Furtun is debated. An account of the 788 rebellion tells of Musa's murder shortly thereafter at the hands of a Banu Husain follower, yet a \"Furtun ibn Musa\" is said to have been killed in his own 802 Zaragoza uprising, and it has been suggested that this name may be an error for Musa ibn Furtun. However, Ibn Hayyan also reports a Furtun from the Banu Qasi forming a coalition with Pamplona, √Ålava, Castile, Amaya and Cerdanya to fight against Amrus ibn Yusuf at this time, suggesting that this is instead a son of Musa ibn Furtun overlooked by Ibn Hazm, whose genealogy provides most of what we know about the clan.\n\nIn the next generation, Mutarrif ibn Musa, was likely a son of Musa ibn Furtun, although historian Ibn Hayyan only mentions his name and does not say that he was a member of the Banu Qasi clan. According to Ibn Hayyan, ‚Äúin (183 H: 799-800) the people of Pamplona deceived Mutarrif ibn Musa and killed him‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis is perhaps one of the most quoted paragraphs by historians who on the basis of this brief news, have woven a complex web of relationships involving the Banu Qasi, the Arista and the Carolingians‚Äù. √âvariste L√©vi-Proven√ßal was the first to say that ‚ÄúPamplona, the capital of Vasconia, had not been governed by the Muslims since 798 (...) and that its inhabitants had killed the representative of the Umayyad authorities, Mutarrif ben Musa Ben Qasi, and had chosen one of their own, named Velasco.‚Äù This Velasco would be the same ‚Äúenemy of God, Balashk al-Yalashqi, Lord of Pamplona‚Äù, a pro-Carolingian against whom the Muslims launched a military campaign in 816. Spanish historian Claudio S√°nchez Albornoz did not agree with this interpretation and believed that it had been the people of Pamplona, without any outside intervention, who took matters in their own hands. No where does Ibn Hayyan mention that Mutarrif ibn Musa was the governor of Pamplona or that Velasco was pro-Carolingian.\n\nIt was Musa's son Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi whose rule brought the family to the peak of its power.\n\nBesides the Arab sources, Musa ibn Musa is mentioned in three Latin texts: the \"Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis\"; the \"Albendensis\"; and the \"C√≥dice de Roda\". The latter mentions his family relations as the half-brother and son-in-law of King √ç√±igo Arista and the properties he held. The \"Albeldensis\" describes the Battle of Monte Laturce, also referred to as the second Battle of Albelda, whereas the Chronicle of Alfonso III provides a more detailed account of his life and feats.\n\nWhile Musa had been orphaned at an early age, his military activity may have begun in the 820s, and the Banu Qasi (possibly Musa himself) most probably participated in the second battle of the pass of Roncevaux along with their relatives of Pamplona, an event leading to the establishment of the kingdom of Pamplona. Historians agree that in the 840s, Musa launched a series of revolts, in conjunction with his maternal half-brother, √ç√±igo Arista of Pamplona. Abd ar-Rahman II defeated them, and took Musa's son Lubb hostage. Musa repeatedly submitted, only to rise again. After repeated rebellions he controlled a region along the Ebro from Borja to Logro√±o, including Tudela, Tarazona, Arnedo and Calahorra. The 851/2 deaths of √ç√±igo Arista and Abd ar-Rahman II, as well as a victory over Christian forces at Albelda, gave Musa unprecedented status. The new emir, Muhammad I of C√≥rdoba named Musa the Wali of Zaragoza and governor of the Upper March. Over the next decade Musa expanded the family's lands to include Zaragoza, Najera, Viguera and Calatayud, while also governing Tudela, Huesca and Toledo, and according to the \"Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis\", Musa had his followers call him \"the third king of \"Spaniae\".\n\nHowever, in 859, Ordo√±o I of Asturias and Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez of Pamplona joined forces to deal Musa a crushing defeat at Albelda, which passed into Christian legend as the Battle of Clavijo. Emir Muhammad then stripped Musa of his titles and restored direct Cordoban control over the region. Musa died in 862 of wounds received in a petty squabble with a son-in-law, and the family disappeared from the political scene for a decade.\n\nFollowing the 862 death of Musa, nothing is known of the family until 871. It is presumed that the members of the family associated with the Cordoban court and military campaigns, but no record of their presence there survives. According to the \"Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis\", upon learning of his father's defeat at Albelda, his son Lubb ibn Musa ibn with all his men, submitted themselves to the rule of the Asturian king Ordo√±o and became his lifelong subjects. By the time the Banu Qasi reappear, they had lost control of most of their lands, being left with just a small area surrounding Arnedo. In 870, a rebellion in Huesca initiated a chain of events that would bring the Banu Qasi back to dominance. In that year, Amrus ibn Umar of the Banu Amrus assassinated the \"amil\" Musa ibn Galind, son of the turncoat brother of Pamplona king Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez. The \"Amir\", Muhammad, sent an army to the north, but Amrus allied himself with Garc√≠a, and the Cordoban general, Abd al-Gafir ibn Abd al-Aziz, was killed before the gates of Zaragoza. The Banu Qasi sons of Musa, apparently under the leadership of eldest son Lubb ibn Musa, then allied themselves with Garc√≠a, and reestablished control over their father's possessions. First, the residents of Huesca called on Mutarrif ibn Musa ibn Qasi for leadership. In January 872, Isma'il ibn Musa entered Zaragoza, and was there joined by Lubb, the two of them together taking Monzon. Isma'il also allied himself with the Banu Jalaf of Barbitanya, marrying Sayyida, daughter of Abd Allah ibn Jalaf. Furtun ibn Musa occupied Tudela, whose governor the Banu Qasi imprisoned at Arnedo, then killed following an escape. Lubb also occupied and refortified Viguera.\n\nThe immediate response of emir Muhammad was to try to limit the expansion of the Banu Qasi by installing a rival dynasty, the Arab Banu Tujibi, in Calatayud, the one part of their father's possessions not reclaimed. In the next year, 873, Muhammad launched a campaign against the various northern rebels. He first bought off the rebels of Toledo with governorships, and this encouraged Amrus to offer his loyalty, for which he was rewarded with Huesca where he captured Mutarrif and his family, including wife Belasquita, the daughter of Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez of Pamplona. In spite of a desperate attack by the combined troops of his brothers, Mutarrif and three sons, Muhammad, Musa and Lubb, were taken to C√≥rdoba and crucified. The next year, Furtun died in Tudela, while Lubb was killed in an accident in Viguera in 875. This left control of the family in the hands of two men, the remaining brother Isma'il ibn Musa in Monzon, and Lubb's son, Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi, who is first known as a defender of Zaragoza against the emirate troops.\n\nOver the next decade, following the deaths of his father and two uncles, Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi maneuvered to become the leader of the family. He resisted 879 and 882 campaigns from C√≥rdoba. The latter was under general, Hashim ibn Abd al-Aziz, and Muhammad tried to persuade Hashim to unite with him against the Asturians, now ruled by Alfonso III. The earlier hostage-taking done by all parties, greatly complicated such situation. Hashim did not want to antagonize Alfonso, who was holding his son as an hostage. Hashim himself held a son of Isma'il ibn Musa, and he sent his captive and other gifts to Alfonso in return for his son. Muhammad would later ally himself with the kings of Pamplona and Asturias, and it was apparently he who raised the future Ordo√±o II of Le√≥n at his court.The struggle for power within the Banu Qasi family came to a head in 882, when Muhammad fought, near Calahorra, a 7000-man force of his uncle Isma'il ibn Musa, and Isma'il ibn Furtun, a son of his uncle Furtun. In the following internecine squabbles, Furtun's four sons were killed and Isma'il ibn Musa was forced to retreat to Monzon. From there he rebuilt Lleida and routed an army sent by Wilfred of Barcelona. Muhammad ibn Lubb, now the clear head of the family, was left in control of the majority of the Banu Qasi lands. In 884, the emir sent two military campaigns into the region and took Zaragoza, although chronicler Ibn Hayyan reports that Muhammad ibn Lubb had sold the city to count Raymond I of Pallars and Ribagorza prior to its fall. This resulted in a consolidated Banu Qasi powerbase around Arnedo, Borja, Calahorra and Viguera, with Isma'il holding an enclave to the east, around Monzon and Lleida.\n\nIn 885 and 886, Muhammad launched attacks against Castile, in the first apparently killing count Diego Rodr√≠guez Porcelos, while the second was an attack on √Ålava in which many Christians were killed. The latter year also saw the death of emir Muhammad I of C√≥rdoba. Muhammad ibn Lubb tested his power against the new emirs, and they responded by again trying to balance Banu Qasi power in the region, giving Zaragoza to the rival Tujibids, and Huesca to Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik al-Tawil of the Muwallad Banu Shabrit clan. The latter was shortly challenged by Isma'il ibn Musa, whose sons fought a battle against al-Tawil's troops, Musa ibn Isma'il being killed and his brother Mutarrif captured. Isma'il died shortly thereafter, in 889, and al-Tawil and Muhammad ibn Lubb each took their case to emir Abd Allah for possession of Isma'il's lands, the emir confirming the succession of Muhammad ibn Lubb. There followed a period of relative peace and collaboration between Muhammad ibn Lubb and al-Tawil. In 891, Muhammad defeated a Christian force at Castro Sibiriano, but he dedicated most of his efforts in his final years against Tujibid Zaragoza, initiating what would become a 17-year siege. In 897, the citizens of Toledo rose up and offered their city to Muhammad, but being occupied with Zaragoza, he sent his son Lubb. Muhammad was reconnoitering Zaragoza in 898, when on 8 October, he was caught by a guard who spitted him on a lance. His head was presented to the Tujibids, who sent it to C√≥rdoba, where it was displayed in front of the palace for eight days before being buried with the honors due a brave foe.\n\nMuhammad's son, Lubb ibn Muhammad ibn Qasi, was born in 870, and was already active at the time of his father's death. In 896, he was refortifying Monzon when al-Tawil of Huesca tried his luck. Though being attacked by a larger, better equipped army, Lubb was able to rout al-Tawil's men, taking his brother prisoner. In January 897 he went to Toledo to take up the leadership offer the citizens had made his father. Back in the east, he launched an attack on Aura that led to the death of Wilfred of Barcelona. Returning through Toledo in 898, he next marched to Ja√©n, with the intent of forming a coalition with another rebel, Umar ibn Hafsun, but before Umar reached Ja√©n, the news of his father's death at Zaragoza forced Lubb's return to Tudela, where he formally recognized the sovereignty of the emir, Abd Allah, in exchange for the formal governorship over Tudela and Tarazona. His return north found al-Tawil moving to take advantage of the temporary power vacuum and three weeks after his father's death, Lubb captured the Huesca ruler in a skirmish. To buy his freedom, al-Tawil ceded lands between Huesca and Monzon to Lubb, and agreed to pay 100,000 gold dinares for the possession of Huesca. Paying 50,000 immediately, he gave his son Abd al-Malik and daughter Sayyida as hostages to ensure payment of the second half. Lubb would relent, forgiving the remaining debt and returning the hostages except Sayyida, whom he married.\n\nLubb ibn Muhammad continued his father's siege of Zaragoza, but found himself drawn in other directions. Perhaps in 900, Alfonso III, in conjunction with Fort√∫n Garc√©s of Pamplona, launched a raid against Tarazona, in Lubb's realms; which he successfully blocked. Then in 903, Toledo again rebelled against Cordova, asking Lubb to take control. He sent his brother Mutarrif, who was proclaimed their \"Amir\". Mutarrif's fate is unknown, but by 906, he had been replaced by Lubb's kinsman, Muhammad ibn Isma'il, son of Isma'il ibn Musa, who was then assassinated. Alfonso again attacked Lubb's lands, laying siege to Gra√±√≥n, but was forced to lift the siege when Lubb moved with an army toward Alava. This threat neutralized, Lubb turned toward Pallars, ravaging the lands, killing hundreds and taking a thousand captives, including Isarn, Count Raymond's son, who was kept in Tudela for a decade before being freed.\n\nIn 905, a coalition of the King of Asturias, the counts of Aragon and Pallars, and, it is sometimes claimed, Lubb ibn Muhammad, engineered a coup in Navarre that brought Sancho Garc√©s to the throne in place of Fort√∫n Garc√©s. Two years later, Lubb launched an attack on Pamplona and fought at \"Li√©dena\" on 30 September 907, resulting in a total rout of the Banu Qasi forces, while Lubb was killed. The transcendent battle marked a permanent change in the regional balance, Sancho's Pamplona becoming a major regional power, while it initiated the final decline of the Banu Qasi.\n\nWith the fall of Lubb, his local rivals immediately fell upon the Banu Qasi lands. Sancho descended toward Calahorra. The Tujibids finally broke the siege of Zaragoza and captured Ejea. Al-Tawil retook the lands he had lost, and proceeded to overrun the family's eastern enclave, taking Barbastro and Lleida. Monzon was briefly controlled by Lubb's brother Yunis ibn Muhammad, but he could not hold it, and Monzon too fell to the al-Tawil. In the reduced western lands, Lubb was succeeded by brother Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Qasi. In 911, Abd Allah and al-Tawil jointly, along with al-Tawil's brother-in-law Galindo Azn√°rez II of Aragon, attacked Pamplona. After destroying several castles, they developed cold feet and withdrew, but were caught by Sancho. Al-Tawil defected and escaped, while Galindo was crushed and forced to recognize Sancho as feudal sovereign, ending the autonomy of the Aragon. Arab sources describe Abd Allah's rear-guard action at Luesia as a victory, but if so it was only a tactical victory and he immediately retreated south. In 914, Sancho turned the tables, marching into the heart of the Banu Qasi homeland, taking Arnedo and attacking Calahorra. In the next year, 915, Sancho turned toward Tudela, and there captured Abd Allah, killing a thousand of his best men. Mutarrif ibn Muhammad ibn Qasi, Abd Allah's brother, rushed to relieve the city, and Abd Allah was ransomed, his daughter Urraca and probably son Furtun ibn Abd Allah being given as hostages. However, two months later Abd Allah was assassinated, it is said, through the machinations of Sancho.\n\nThe only bright spot for the family in this period happened in the east. In 913, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik al-Tawil died, and the next year, the residents of Monzon rejected his son Amrus ibn Muhammad, and invited the Banu Qasi to return in the person of Muhammad ibn Lubb, son of Lubb ibn Muhammad. After a brief siege, he was able to reclaim the city for his family, as well as Lleida.\n\nIn the west, Mutarrif ibn Muhammad and his nephew Muhammad ibn Abd Allah struggled for dominance. The latter proved victorious, killing Mutarrif in 916. Since the death of Lubb in 907, the Banu Qasi had been left fractured and weakened in the face of two resurgent powers: to the north and west, a collaboration between the new king of Le√≥n, Ordo√±o II, and Sancho I of Navarre brought a strong army south, ravaging the Banu Qasi lands around Viguera, Najera and Tudela in 918, while the young and energetic Abd ar-Rahman III, who was to temporarily reverse the centrifugal forces at work in the Emirate, soon to be Caliphate of C√≥rdoba, sent armies north, routing the Christians. The next year, both Banu Qasi leaders, Muhammad ibn Abd Allah and Muhammad ibn Lubb, attacked the Banu al-Tawil at Barbastro, but Sancho took advantage of this, and allying himself with his cousin Bernard I of Ribagorza and the Banu al-Tawil, he attacked and burned Monzon, which was hence lost to the Banu Qasi. In 920, the emir, Abd ar-Rahman III, personally led the Cordoban army north, and forced Sancho to abandon fortifications he had been building. After some maneuvering the emir met the armies of Ordo√±o and Sancho, and defeated them at Valdejunquera. In 923, the Christian allies brought another force south, and while Muhammad ibn Abd Allah formed a coalition of local nobles to resist it, their armies were dispersed and Viguera and Najera fell. Like his father, Muhammad was captured, then assassinated on Sancho's orders, and when Abd ar-Rahman launched another punitive campaign the next year, on his return to Tudela he removed the Banu Qasi and sent them to C√≥rdoba, placing their old rivals the Tujibids of Zaragoza in their place.\nAfter 923, only the eastern enclave encompassing Lleida and the \"hus√ªn\" of Balaguer, Barbastro and Ayera were in the hands of the family. However, one by one these expelled Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi and turned to the Tujibids for leadership, leaving him only Ayera in 928, when Jimeno Garc√©s, the new king of Navarre, intervened on his behalf in opposition to Hasim ibn Muhammad al-Tujibi. The next year, Muhammad fell victim to an ambush and was killed by his brother-in-law, a son of Raymond of Pallars.\n\nThe death of Muhammad ibn Lubb marked the end of the Banu Qasi in the Ebro valley. Their rivals the Tujibids would follow their model, making an independent peace with Leon in 937, a move that resulted in a punitive expedition from the Caliph similar to those of prior years against the Banu Qasi. The Tujibids would eventually establish a full-fledged Taifa kingdom centered at Zaragoza.\n\nTwo other Taifa crowns were ruled by men with names reminiscent of the Banu Qasi and are claimed as dynastic members, although the precise connection, if any, is unknown. A small Taifa state at Alpuente was founded by Abd Allah ibn Qasim. He was of a convert family that claimed a tribal affiliation with the Yamanƒ´/F√≠hrƒ´.\n\nIn 1144, another Christian convert and Sufi mystic from Silves, Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi, called ibn Qasi, rose and established a Taifa state at M√©rtola, expanding it to much of southern Portugal, and he encouraged the successful move of the Almohads (to whom he would submit) against Seville. They fell out and Ibn Qasi was assassinated in 1151 by his own men.; Fort√∫n Ochoiz, a Navarrese who ruled La Rioja in the first half of the eleventh century, may be a descendant of the Banu Qasi.\n\nThe following men are the documented leaders of the Banu Qasi (entries in \"italics\" are of uncertain affiliation to the family):\n\n"}
{"id": "29617833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29617833", "title": "Bielefeld School", "text": "Bielefeld School\n\nThe Bielefeld School is a group of German historians based originally at Bielefeld University who promote social history and political history using quantification and the methods of political science and sociology. The leaders include Hans-Ulrich Wehler, J√ºrgen Kocka and Reinhart Koselleck. Instead of emphasizing the personalities of great historical leaders, as in the conventional approach, it concentrates on socio-cultural developments. History as \"historical social science\" (as Wehler described it) has mainly been explored in the context of studies of German society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The movement has published the scholarly journal \"\" since 1975.\n\nSocial history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s‚Äì60s as the successor to the national history discredited by National Socialism. The German brand of \"history of society\"‚Äî\"Gesellschaftsgeschichte\"‚Äîhas been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. Modernization theory was presented by Wehler and his Bielefeld School as the way to transform \"traditional\" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few \"great men,\" into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the modernization theory of Max Weber, with concepts also from Karl Marx, Otto Hintze, Gustav Schmoller, Werner Sombart and Thorstein Veblen.\n\n\"Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte\" (1987‚Äì) is Wehler's comprehensive 5-volume history of German society in the eighteenth-twentieth centuries. Each volume approaches historical processes from a social history perspective, organized under the themes of demographics, economics, and social equality. His detailed structural analysis of developmental processes supported by a vast body of notes and statistics sometimes obscures the larger context. Nonetheless, patterns of continuity and change in the social fabric are emphasized. More than a historiographical synthesis of Ranke and Marx (envisioned by some German historians after the catastrophe of World War I), Wehler's work incorporates Max Weber's concepts of authority, economy, and culture and strives toward a concept of \"total history.\"\n\nVolumes 1‚Äì2 cover the period from feudalism through the Revolution of 1848. Volume 3 \"Von der \"Deutschen Doppelrevolution\" bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849‚Äì1914\" (1995) employs Wehler's longtime emphasis on a German Sonderweg or \"special path\" as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the twentieth century. Wehler places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s‚Äì1870s, when economic modernization took place, but political modernization did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service. Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernizing society. Recognizing the importance of modernizing forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus). Wehler's \"Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gr√ºndung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914‚Äì1949\" (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society. The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernization of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's fourth volume is his treatment of \"the middle class\" and \"revolution,\" each of which was instrumental in shaping the twentieth century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of \"charismatic domination,\" which focuses heavily on Adolf Hitler. The fifth volume will extend to 1990; none of the series has yet been translated into English.\n\nBritish historian of Germany Richard J. Evans disagreed with the Bielefeld school regarding the Sonderweg thesis. Instead he argued for the roots of Germany‚Äôs political development in the first half of the twentieth century in a \"failed bourgeois revolution\" in 1848. Influenced by the New Left, Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history in the Imperial period \"from below.\" In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled \"Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany\", he launched a critique of the \"top-down\" approach of the Bielefeld School. Evans and the others wanted a perspective from the Left that stressed the importance of the working class by highlighting \"the importance of the grass roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people.\" Along with historians Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn, Evans emphasized the \"self-mobilization from below\" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism.\n\nFrom the 1980s, however, the Bielefeld school was increasingly challenged by proponents of the \"cultural turn\" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.\n\nKocka responded by arguing that social history has become so all-pervasive that it has lost its position as the cutting edge within historiography. He says, \"But: in the meantime social historians' approaches, viewpoints, topics and results have been accepted and incorporated by many other historians who would not call themselves social historians. Social history has successfully penetrated its opponents.\" He expects to see a return to social history, this time with more cultural and linguistic elements.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6462779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6462779", "title": "Chinese creation myths", "text": "Chinese creation myths\n\nChinese creation myths are symbolic narratives about the origins of the universe, earth, and life. In Chinese mythology, the term \"cosmogonic myth\" or \"origin myth\" is more accurate than \"creation myth\", since very few stories involve a creator deity or divine will. Chinese creation myths fundamentally differ from monotheistic traditions with one authorized version, such as the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation myth: Chinese classics record numerous and contradictory origin myths.\n\nSome Chinese cosmogonic myths have familiar themes in comparative mythology. For example, creation from chaos (Chinese Hundun and Hawaiian Kumulipo), dismembered corpses of a primordial being (Pangu and Mesopotamian Tiamat), world parent siblings (Fuxi and N√ºwa and Japanese Izanagi and Izanami), and dualistic cosmology (yin and yang and Zoroastrian Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu). In contrast, other mythic themes are uniquely Chinese. While the mythologies of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece believed primeval water was the single element that existed \"in the beginning\", the basic element of Chinese cosmology was \"qi\" (\"breath; air; life force\"). Birrell explains that \"qi\" \"was believed to embody cosmic energy governing matter, time, and space. This energy, according to Chinese mythic narratives, undergoes a transformation at the moment of creation, so that the nebulous element of vapor becomes differentiated into dual elements of male and female, Yin and Yang, hard and soft matter, and other binary elements.\"\n\nThe \"Tao Te Ching\", written sometime before the 4th century , suggests a less mythical Chinese cosmogony and has some of the earliest allusions to creation.\nThere was something featureless yet complete, born before heaven and earth; Silent‚Äîamorphous‚Äîit stood alone and unchanging. We may regard it as the mother of heaven and earth. Not knowing its name, I style it the \"Way.\"\nThe Way gave birth to unity, Unity gave birth to duality, Duality gave birth to trinity, Trinity gave birth to the myriad creatures. The myriad creatures bear yin on their back and embrace yang in their bosoms. They neutralize these vapors and thereby achieve harmony.\nLater Taoists interpreted this sequence to mean the Tao (\"Dao\", \"Way\"), formless (\"Wuji\", \"Without Ultimate\"), unitary (\"Taiji\", \"Great Ultimate\"), and binary (\"yin\" and \"yang\" or Heaven and Earth).\n\nGirardot reasons that \"Tao Te Ching\" evokes the Tao as \"a cosmic principle of the beginnings would seem to make little sense without seeing the possibility that it was rooted in the symbolic remembrance of archaic mythological, especially cosmogonic, themes.\"\nThe \"Heavenly Questions\" section of the \"Songs of Chu\", written around the 4th century , begins by asking catechistic questions about creation myths. Birrell calls it \"the most valuable document in Chinese mythography\" and surmises an earlier date for its mythos \"since it clearly draws on a preexisting fund of myths.\"\nWho passed down the story of the far-off, ancient beginning of things? How can we be sure what it was like before the sky above and the earth below had taken shape? Since none could penetrate that murk when darkness and light were yet undivided, how do we know about the chaos of insubstantial forms? What manner of things are the darkness and light? How did Yin and Yang come together, and how did they originate and transform all things that are by their commingling? Whose compass measured out the ninefold heavens? Whose work was this, and how did he accomplish it? Where were the circling cords fastened, and where was the sky's pole fixed? Where did the Eight Pillars meet the sky, and why were they too short for it in the south-east? Where do the nine fields of heaven extend to and where do they join each other? The ins and outs of their edges must be very many: who knows their number? How does heaven coordinate its motions? Where are the Twelve Houses divided? How do the sun and the moon hold to their courses and the fixed stars keep their places?\nBirrell describes this Chu creation narrative as a \"vivid world picture. It mentions no prime cause, no first creator. From the \"formless expanse\" the primeval element of misty vapor emerges spontaneously as a creative force, which is organically constructed as a set of binary forces in opposition to each other-upper and lower spheres, darkness and light, Yin and Yang ‚Äì whose mysterious transformations bring about the ordering of the universe.\".\n\nThe \"Daoyuan\" (ÈÅìÂéü, \"Origins of the Tao\") is one of the Huangdi Sijing manuscripts discovered in 1973 among the Mawangdui Silk Texts excavated from a tomb dated to 168. Like the \"Songs of Chu\" above, this text is believed to date from the 4th century and from the same southern state of Chu. This Taoist cosmogonic myth describes the creation of the universe and humans out of formless misty vapor, and Birrell notes the striking resemblance between its ancient \"all was one\" concept of unity before creation and the modern cosmogonic concept of gravitational singularity.\nAt the beginning of eternal past all things penetrated and were identical with great vacuity, Vacuous and identical with the One, rest at the One eternally. Unsettled and confusing, there was no distinction of dark and light. Though Tao is undifferentiated, it is autonomous: \"It has no cause since ancient times\", yet \"the ten thousand things are caused by it without any exception\". Tao is great and universal on the one hand, but also formless and nameless.\nThe 4th or 3rd century \"Taiyi Shengshui\" (\"Great One Giving Birth to Water\"), a Taoist text recently excavated in the Guodian Chu Slips, seems to offer its own unique creation myth, but analysis remains uncertain.\n\nThe 139 \"Huainanzi\", an eclectic text compiled under the direction of the Han prince Liu An, contains two cosmogonic myths that develop the dualistic concept of Yin and Yang:\nWhen Heaven and Earth were yet unformed, all was ascending and flying, diving and delving. Thus it was called the Grand Inception. The Grand Inception produced the Nebulous Void. The Nebulous Void produced space-time, space-time produced the original \"qi\". A boundary [divided] the original \"qi\". That which was pure and bright spread out to form Heaven; that which was heavy and turbid congealed to form Earth. It is easy for that which is pure and subtle to converge but difficult for the heavy and turbid to congeal. Therefore, Hell was completed first; Earth was fixed afterward. The conjoined essences of Heaven and Earth produced yin and yang. The supersessive essences of yin and yang caused the four seasons. The scattered essences of the four seasons created the myriad things. The hot \"qi\" of accumulated yang produced fire; the essence of fiery \"qi\" became the sun. The cold \"qi\" of accumulated yin produced water; the essence of watery \"qi\" became the moon. The overflowing \"qi\" of the essences of the sun and the moon made the stars and planets. To Heaven belong the sun, moon, stars, and planets; to Earth belong waters and floods, dust and soil.\nOf old, in the time before there was Heaven and Earth: There were only images and no forms. All was obscure and dark, vague and unclear, shapeless and formless, and no one knows its gateway. There were two spirits, born in murkiness, one that established Heaven and the other that constructed Earth. So vast! No one knows where they ultimately end. So broad! No one knows where they finally stop. Thereupon they differentiated into the yin and the yang and separated into the eight cardinal directions. The firm and the yielding formed each other; the myriad things thereupon took shape. The turbid vital energy became creatures; the refined vital energy became humans.\nBirrell suggests this abstract Yin-Yang dualism between the two primeval spirits or gods may be the \"vestige of a much older mythological paradigm that was then rationalized and diminished\", comparable to the Akkadian \"En√ªma Eli≈°\" creation myth of Abzu and Tiamat, male fresh water and female salt water.\n\nThe \"Lingxian\" (ÈùàÊÜ≤), written around 120 by the polymath Zhang Heng, thoroughly accounts for the creation of Heaven and Earth.\nBefore the Great Plainness [or Great Basis, Taisu, Â§™Á¥†] came to be, there was dark limpidity and mysterious quiescence, dim and dark. No image of it can be formed. Its midst was void; its exterior was non-existence. Things remained thus for long ages; this is called obscurity [\"mingxing\", Ê∫üÊ∂¨]. It was the root of the Dao‚Ä¶ When the stem of the Dao had been grown, creatures came into being and shapes were formed. At this stage, the original \"qi\" split and divided, hard and soft first divided, pure and turbid took up different positions. Heaven formed on the outside, and Earth became fixed within. Heaven took its body from the Yang, so it was round and in motion; Earth took its body from the Yin, so it was flat and quiescent. Through motion there was action and giving forth; through quiescence there was conjoining and transformation. Through binding together there was fertilization, and in time all the kinds of things were brought to growth. This is called the Great Origin [Taiyuan, Â§™ÂÖÉ]. It was the fruition of the Dao.\n\nThe Neo-Confucianist philosopher Zhou Dunyi provided a multifaceted cosmology in his \"Taiji Tushuo\" (Â§™Ê•µÂúñË™™, \"Diagram Explaining the Supreme Ultimate\"), which integrated the \"I Ching\" with Taoism and Chinese Buddhism.\n\nIn contrast to the above Chinese cosmogonic myths about the world and humans originating spontaneously without a creator (e.g., from \"refined vital energy\" in the \"Huainanzi\"), two later origin myths for humans involve divinities. The female N√ºwa fashioned people from loess and mud (in early myths) or from procreating with her brother/husband Fuxi (in later versions). Myths about the male Pangu say that people derived from mites on his corpse.\n\nIn Chinese mythology, the goddess N√ºwa repaired the fallen pillars holding up the sky, creating human beings either before or after. The ancient Chinese believed in a square earth and a round, domelike sky supported by eight giant pillars (cf. the European ideas of an \"axis mundi\").\n\nThe \"Heavenly Questions\" of the \"Songs of Chu\" from around the 4th century is the first surviving text that refers to N√ºwa: \"By what law was N√º Wa raised up to become high lord? By what means did she fashion the different creatures?\"\n\nTwo \"Huainanzi\" chapters record N√ºwa mythology two centuries later:\nGoing back to more ancient times, the four [of 8] pillars were broken; the nine provinces were in tatters. Heaven did not completely cover [the earth]; Earth did not hold up [Heaven] all the way around [its circumference]. Fires blazed out of control and could not be extinguished; water flooded in great expanses and would not recede. Ferocious animals ate blameless people; predatory birds snatched the elderly and the weak. Thereupon, N√ºwa smelted together five-colored stones in order to patch up the azure sky, cut off the legs of the great turtle to set them up as the four pillars, killed the black dragon to provide relief for Ji Province, and piled up reeds and cinders to stop the surging waters. The azure sky was patched; the four pillars were set up; the surging waters were drained; the province of Ji was tranquil; crafty vermin died off; blameless people [preserved their] lives. Bearing the square [nine] provinces on her back and embracing Heaven, [Fuxi and N√ºwa established] the harmony of spring and the yang of summer, the slaughtering of autumn and the restraint of winter.\nThe Yellow Emperor produced yin and yang. Shang Pian produced ears and eyes; Sang Lin produced shoulders and arms. N√ºwa used these to carry out the seventy transformations?\nShang Pian (‰∏äÈß¢) and Sang Lin (Ê°ëÊûó) are obscure mythic divinities. The commentary of Xu Shen written around 100 says \"seventy transformations\" refers to Nuwa's power to create everything in the world.\n\nThe \"Fengsu Tongyi\" (\"Common Meanings in Customs\"), written by Ying Shao around 195, describes Han-era beliefs about the primeval goddess.\nPeople say that when Heaven and earth opened and unfolded, humankind did not yet exist, N√º Kua kneaded yellow earth and fashioned human beings. Though she worked feverishly, she did not have enough strength to finish her task, so she drew her cord in a furrow through the mud and lifted it out to make human beings. That is why rich aristocrats are the human beings made from yellow earth, while ordinary poor commoners are the human beings made from the cord's furrow.\nBirrell identifies two worldwide mythic motifs in Ying Shao's account. Myths commonly say the first humans were created from clay, dirt, soil, or bone; N√ºwa used mud and loess. Myths widely refer to social stratification; N√ºwa created the rich from loess and the poor from mud. In contrast, the builder's cord motif is uniquely Chinese and iconographic of the Goddess. In Han iconography, N√ºwa sometimes holds a builder's compass.\n\nThe 9th-century \"Duyi Zhi\" (Áç®Áï∞Âøó, \"A Treatise on Extraordinary Things\") by Li Rong records a later tradition that N√ºwa and her brother Fuxi were the first humans. In this version, the goddess has been demoted from \"primal creatrix to a mortal subservient to God in Heaven\" and a \"lowly female subservient to the male, in the traditional manner of marital relations.\"\nLong ago, when the world first began, there were two people, N√º Kua and her older brother. They lived on Mount K'un-lun. And there were not yet any ordinary people in the world. They talked about becoming husband and wife, but they felt ashamed. So the brother at once went with his sister up Mount K'un-lun and made this prayer: \"Oh Heaven, if Thou wouldst send us two forth as man and wife, then make all the misty vapor gather. If not, then make all the misty vapor disperse.\" At this, the misty vapor immediately gathered. When the sister became intimate with her brother, they plaited some grass to make a fan to screen their faces. Even today, when a man takes a wife, they hold a fan, which is a symbol of what happened long ago.\n\nOne of the most popular creation myths in Chinese mythology describes the first-born semidivine human Pangu (Áõ§Âè§, \"Coiled Antiquity\") separating the world egg-like Hundun (Ê∑∑Ê≤å, \"primordial chaos\") into Heaven and Earth. However, none of the ancient Chinese classics mentions the Pangu myth, which was first recorded in the 3rd-century \"Sanwu Liji\" (‰∏â‰∫îÊ≠¥Ë®ò, \"Historical Records of the Three Sovereign Divinities and the Five Gods\"), attributed to the Three Kingdoms period Taoist author Xu Zheng. Thus, in classical Chinese mythology, N√ºwa predates Pangu by six centuries. \nHeaven and earth were in chaos like a chicken's egg, and P'an Ku was born in the middle of it. In eighteen thousand years Heaven and the earth opened and unfolded. The limpid that was Yang became the heavens, the turbid that was Yin became the earth. P'an Ku lived within them, and in one day he went through nine transformations, becoming more divine than Heaven and wiser than earth. Each day the heavens rose ten feet higher, each day the earth grew ten feet thicker, and each day P'an Ku grew ten feet taller. And so it was that in eighteen thousand years the heavens reached their fullest height, earth reached its lowest depth, and P'an Ku became fully grown. Afterwards, there was the Three Sovereign Divinities. Numbers began with one, were established with three, perfected by five, multiplied with seven, and fixed with nine. That is why Heaven is ninety thousand leagues from earth. \n\nLike the \"Sanwu Liji\", the \"Wuyun Linian Ji\" (‰∫îÈÅ†Ê≠∑Âπ¥Á¥Ä, \"A Chronicle of the Five Cycles of Time\") is another 3rd-century text attributed to Xu Zheng. This version details the cosmological metamorphosis of Pangu's microcosmic body into the macrocosm of the physical world.\nWhen the firstborn, P'an Ku, was approaching death, his body was transformed. His breath became the wind and clouds; his voice became peals of thunder. His left eye became the sun; his right eye became the moon. His four limbs and five extremities became the four cardinal points and the five peaks. His blood and semen became water and rivers. His muscles and veins became the earth's arteries; his flesh became fields and land. His hair and beard became the stars; his bodily hair became plants and trees. His teeth and bones became metal and rock; his vital marrow became pearls and jade. His sweat and bodily fluids became streaming rain. All the mites on his body were touched by the wind and evolved into the black-haired people.\nLincoln found parallels between Pangu and the Indo-European world parent myth, such as the primeval being's flesh becoming earth and hair becoming plants.\n\nNorman J. Girardot, professor of Chinese religion at Lehigh University, analyzed complications within studies of Chinese creation mythology. On the one hand, \nWith regard to China there is the very real problem of the extreme paucity and fragmentation of mythological accounts, an almost total absence of any coherent mythic narratives dating to the early periods of Chinese culture. This is even more true with respect to authentic cosmogonic myths, since the preserved fragments are extremely meager and in most cases are secondary accounts historicized and moralized by the redactors of the Confucian school that was emerging as the predominant classical tradition during the Former Han period.\nOn the other hand, there are issues with what Girardot calls the \"China as a special case fallacy\"; presuming that unlike \"other ancient cultures more blatantly caught up in the throes of religion and myth\", China did not have any creation myths, with the exception of Pangu, which was a late, and likely foreign, importation.\n\nGirardot traces the origins of this \"methodological rigidity\" or \"benign neglect\" for the study of Chinese religion and mythology back to early 19th-century missionary scholars who sought creation myths in early Chinese texts, \"the concern for the study of Chinese cosmogony on the part of the missionaries resulted in a frustration over not finding anything that resembled the Christian doctrine of a rational creator God.\" For instance, the missionary and translator Walter Henry Medhurst claimed Chinese religions suffered because \"'no first cause' characterizes all the sects\", \"the Supreme, self-existent God is scarcely traceable through the entire range of their metaphysics\", and the whole system of Chinese cosmogony \"is founded in materialism\".\n\nThis \"China as a special case\" theory became an article of faith among 20th-century scholars. The French sinologist Marcel Granet's influential \"Chinese Thought\" said:\nit is necessary to notice the privileged place given to politics by the Chinese. For them, the history of the world does not start before the start of civilization. It does not originate by a recitation of a creation or by cosmological speculations, but with the biographies of the sage kings. The biographies of the ancient heroes of China contain numerous mythic elements; but no cosmogonic theme has entered into the literature without having undergone a transformation. All of the legends pretend to report the facts of a human history... The predominance accorded to political preoccupation is accompanied for the Chinese by a profound repulsion for all theories of creation.\nSome further examples are:\n\n\n"}

Modern Muscogees live primarily in Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Their language, \"Mvskoke\", is a member of the Creek branch of the Muskogean language family. The Seminole are close kin to the Muscogee and speak a Creek language as well. The Creeks were considered one of the Five Civilized Tribes. After the Creek War many of the Creeks escaped to Florida to create the Seminole.\n\nThe early historic Creeks were probably descendants of the Mississippian culture peoples who lived along the Tennessee River, in what is now modern Tennessee and Alabama, and possibly related to the Utinahica of southern Georgia. More of a loose confederacy than a single tribe, the Muscogee lived in autonomous villages in river valleys throughout what are today the states of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama also consisted of many ethnic groups speaking several distinct languages, such as the Hitchiti, Alabama, and Coushatta. Those who lived along the Ocmulgee River and the Oconee River were called \"Creek Indians\" by British traders from South Carolina; eventually the name was applied to all of the various natives of Creek towns becoming increasingly divided between the Lower Towns of the Georgia frontier on the Chattahoochee River, Ocmulgee River, and Flint River and the Upper Towns of the Alabama River Valley.\n\nThe Lower Towns included Coweta, Cusseta (Kasihta, Cofitachequi), Upper Chehaw (Chiaha), Hitchiti, Oconee, Ocmulgee, Okawaigi, Apalachee, Yamasee (Altamaha), Ocfuskee, Sawokli, and Tamali. The Upper Towns included Tuckabatchee, Abihka, Coosa (Kusa; the dominant people of East Tennessee and North Georgia during the Spanish explorations), Itawa (original inhabitants of the Etowah Indian Mounds), Hothliwahi (Ullibahali), Hilibi, Eufaula, Wakokai, Atasi, Alibamu, Coushatta (Koasati; they had absorbed the Kaski/Casqui and the Tali), and Tuskegee (\"Napochi\" in the de Luna chronicles).\n\nCusseta (Kasihta) and Coweta are the two principal towns of the Creek Nation to this day. Traditionally the Cusseta and Coweta bands are considered to the earliest members of the Creek Nation.\n\nThe Creek believed that the world was originally entirely underwater. The only land was a hill, called Nunne Chaha, and on the hill was a house, wherein lived Esaugetuh Emissee (\"master of breath\"). He created humanity from the clay on the hill.\n\nThe Creek also venerated the Horned Serpent Sint Holo, who appeared to suitably wise young men.\n\nIn the underworld, there was only chaos and odd creatures. Master of Breath created Brother Moon and Sister Sun, as well as the four directions to hold up the world.\n\nThe first people were the offspring of Sister Sun and the Horned Serpent. These first two Creeks were Lucky Hunter and Corn Woman, denoting their respective roles in Creek Society.\n\nHisagita-imisi (meaning \"preserver of breath\"; also Hisakitaimisi) was the supreme god, a solar deity. He is also called Ibofanga (\"the one who is sitting above (us)\").\n\n"}

In the UK the only older cosmetic company is Yardley.\n\nThe Cyclax Company was founded in 1897 by Mrs Hemming (real name Frances (Fanny) Forsythe n√©e Hamilton [1872-1934]) in a converted front room of a house at 58 South Molton Street, London, to provide beauty treatments. In 1902, Cyclax began to sell cosmetics generally and by 1910 there were over 40 preparations in the Cyclax range including skin care products, hair care products, face powders, eye lotions, lip lotions and soap. In the period before the First World War, Cyclax products went on sale in Europe and across parts of the British Empire.\n\nIn 1919 Frances Forsythe's son, Gery Hamilton Forsythe [1896-1964], returned from the United States to help with the business and he eventually assumed control of the company. He established separate companies and local manufacturing in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States in the 1930s. Cyclax salons were also established in various parts of the world maintained by Cyclax trained staff some of whom travelled to London to become international Cyclax representatives.\n\nThe Second World War presented some problems for Cyclax. Although the business at South Molton Street survived, the factory at Tottenham Court Road was destroyed during the London Blitz and temporary facilities had to be used until the new factory was established in Harlow New Town, Essex in 1953. Cyclax made a number of contributions to the war effort including a burn treatment and a camouflage cream. In 1939 they also released a lipstick shade named 'Auxiliary Red' that was specifically designed for service women. It has been suggested that this lipstick started the trend for the use of bright red lipsticks during the war.\n\nThis was a difficult time for Cyclax, as it was for many British cosmetic companies who faced heavy taxation and increased competition from American firms like Max Factor and Revlon. One prominent supporter of Cyclax during this period was Princess Elizabeth. She used a Cyclax consultant, Thelma Besant, as her Cosmetician and Beauty Adviser both before and after she was crowned. Thelma advised the Queen on skin care and cosmetics for the coronation and the numerous royal tours in the early part of her reign. A Royal Warrant of Appointment was issued to Cyclax in 1961.\n\nCyclax was a family owned business until it was bought by the American merchant bankers Lehman Brothers, Inc. in 1970 on behalf of a group of private investors. They closed salon in South Molton Street, streamlined the product line and repackaged it. Through the 1970s and 1980s the company passed through numerous owners including British American Tobacco and SmithKIine Beecham. It was sold by Richards & Appleby Ltd. in October 2018 to Three Pears Ltd who plan to rejuvenate the brand. The current product range is largely based on the use of natural ingredients and will be 100% manufactured in the UK.\n\n"}

{"id": "239253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=239253", "title": "Execution by elephant", "text": "Execution by elephant\n\nExecution by elephant was a common method of capital punishment in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in India, where Asian elephants were used to crush, dismember or torture captives in public executions. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's absolute power and his ability to control wild animals.\n\nThe sight of elephants executing captives both horrified and attracted the interest of European travellers and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the European empires that colonised the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by Western powers, such as Ancient Rome and Carthage, particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.\n\nThe intelligence, domesticability and versatility of the elephant gave it considerable advantages over other wild animals such as lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners in a variety of ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.\n\nHistorically, the elephants were under the constant control of a driver or \"mahout\", thus enabling a ruler to grant a last-minute reprieve and display merciful qualities. Several such exercises of mercy are recorded in various Asian kingdoms. The kings of Siam trained their elephants to roll the convicted person \"about the ground rather slowly so that he is not badly hurt\". The Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great is said to have \"used this technique to chastise 'rebels' and then in the end the prisoners, presumably much chastened, were given their lives\". On one occasion, Akbar was recorded to have had a man thrown to the elephants to suffer five days of such treatment before pardoning him. Elephants were occasionally used in trial by ordeal in which the condemned prisoner was released if he managed to fend off the elephant.\n\nThe use of elephants in such fashion went beyond the common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as Thailand, where white elephants are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent the message that the ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.\n\nExecution by elephant has been done in many parts of the world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the classical period. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While African elephants are significantly larger than Asian elephants, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.\n\nElephants are widely reported to have been used to carry out executions in Southeast Asia, and were used in Burma and Malaysia from the earliest historical times as well as in the kingdom of Champa on the other side of the Indochinese Peninsula. In Siam, elephants were trained to throw the condemned into the air before trampling them to death. Alexander Hamilton provides the following account from Siam:\n\nThe journal of John Crawfurd records another method of execution by elephant in the kingdom of Cochinchina (modern south Vietnam), where he served as a British envoy in 1821. Crawfurd recalls an event where \"the criminal is tied to a stake, and [Excellency's favourite] elephant runs down upon him and crushes him to death.\"\n\nElephants were used as executioners of choice in India for many centuries. Hindu and Muslim rulers executed tax evaders, rebels and enemy soldiers alike \"under the feet of elephants\". The Hindu \"Manu Smriti\" or Laws of Manu, written down around AD 200, prescribed execution by elephants for a number of offences. If property was stolen, for instance, \"the king should have any thieves caught in connection with its disappearance executed by an elephant.\" For example, in 1305, the sultan of Delhi turned the deaths of Mongol prisoners into public entertainment by having them crushed by elephants.\n\nDuring the Mughal era, \"it was a common mode of execution in those days to have the offender trampled underfoot by an elephant.\" Captain Alexander Hamilton, writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan ordered an offending military commander to be carried \"to the Elephant Garden, and there to be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death\". The Mughal Emperor Humayun ordered the crushing by elephant of an imam he mistakenly believed to be critical of his reign. Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor Jahangir, is said to have ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The French traveler Fran√ßois Bernier, who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment. Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of Delhi, elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces \"with pointed blades fitted to their tusks\".\nThe Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta, visiting Delhi in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:\nOther Indian polities also carried out executions by elephant. The Maratha Chatrapati Sambhaji ordered this form of death for a number of conspirators, including the Maratha official Anaji Datto in the late seventeenth century. Another Maratha leader, the general Santaji, inflicted the punishment for breaches in military discipline. The contemporary historian Khafi Khan reported that \"for a trifling offense he [Santaji] would cast a man under the feet of an elephant.\"\n\nThe early 19th century writer Robert Kerr relates how the king of Goa \"keeps certain elephants for the execution of malefactors. When one of these is brought forth to dispatch a criminal, if his keeper desires that the offender be destroyed speedily, this vast creature will instantly crush him to atoms under his foot; but if desired to torture him, will break his limbs successively, as men are broken on the wheel.\" The naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon cited this flexibility of purpose as evidence that elephants were capable of \"human reasoning, [rather] than a simple, natural instinct\".\n\nSuch executions were often held in public as a warning to any who may transgress. To that end, many of the elephants were especially large, often weighing in excess of nine tons. The executions were intended to be gruesome and often were. They were sometimes preceded by torture publicly inflicted by the same elephant used for the execution. An account of one such torture-and-execution at Baroda in 1814 has been preserved in \"The Percy Anecdotes\":\n\nThe use of elephants as executioners continued well into the latter half of the 19th century. During an expedition to central India in 1868, Louis Rousselet described the execution of a criminal by an elephant. A sketch depicting the execution showed the condemned being forced to place his head upon a pedestal, and then being held there while an elephant crushed his head underfoot. The sketch was made into a woodcut and printed in \"Le Tour du Monde\", a widely circulated French journal of travel and adventure, as well as foreign journals such as \"Harper's Weekly\".\n\nThe growing power of the British Empire led to the decline and eventual end of elephant executions in India. Writing in 1914, Eleanor Maddock noted that in Kashmir, since the arrival of Europeans, \"many of the old customs are disappearing ‚Äì and one of these is the dreadful custom of the execution of criminals by an elephant trained for the purpose and which was known by the hereditary name of 'Gunga Rao'.\"\n\nElephants were widely used across the Indian subcontinent and South Asia as a method of execution. The English sailor Robert Knox, writing in 1681, described a method of execution by elephant which he had witnessed while being held captive in Sri Lanka. Knox says the elephants he witnessed had their tusks fitted with \"sharp Iron with a socket with three edges\". After impaling the victim's body with its tusks, the elephant would \"then tear it in pieces, and throw it limb from limb\".\n\nThe 19th century traveler James Emerson Tennent comments that \"a Kandyan [Sri Lankan] chief, who was witness to such scenes, has assured us that the elephant never once applied his tusks, but, placing his foot on the prostrate victim, plucked off his limbs in succession by a sudden movement of his trunk.\" Knox's book depicts exactly this method of execution in a famous drawing, \"An Execution by an Eliphant\".\n\nWriting in 1850, the British diplomat Henry Charles Sirr described a visit to one of the elephants that had been used by Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last king of Kandy, to execute criminals. Crushing by elephant had been abolished by the British after they overthrew the Kandyan kingdom in 1815 but the king's execution elephant was still alive and evidently remembered its former duties. Sirr comments:\n\nDuring the medieval period, executions by elephants were used by several West Asian imperial powers, including the Byzantine, Sassanid, Seljuq and Timurid empires. When the Sassanid king Khosrau II, who had a harem of 3,000 wives and 12,000 female slaves, demanded as a wife Hadiqah, the daughter of the Christian Arab Na'aman, Na'aman refused to permit his Christian daughter to enter the harem of a Zoroastrian; for this refusal, he was trampled to death by an elephant.\n\nThe practice appears to have been adopted in parts of the Muslim Middle East. Rabbi Petachiah of Ratisbon, a twelfth-century Jewish traveler, reported an execution by this means during his stay in Seljuk-ruled northern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq):\n\nThe Romans, Carthaginians and ancient Macedonians occasionally used elephants for executions while also making use of war elephants for military purposes, most famously in the case of Hannibal. Deserters, prisoners of war and military criminals are recorded by ancient chroniclers to have been put to death under the foot of an elephant. Perdiccas, who became regent of Macedon on the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, had mutineers from the faction of Meleager thrown to the elephants to be crushed in the city of Babylon. The Roman writer Quintus Curtius Rufus relates the story in his Historiae Alexandri Magni: \"Perdiccas saw that they [the mutineers] were paralyzed and at his mercy. He withdrew from the main body some 300 men who had followed Meleager at the time when he burst from the first meeting held after Alexander's death, and before the eyes of the entire army he threw them to the elephants. All were trampled to death beneath the feet of the beasts...\".\n\nSimilarly, the Roman writer Valerius Maximus records how the general Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus \"after King Perseus was vanquished [in 167 BC], for the same fault (desertion) threw men under elephants to be trampled ... And indeed military discipline needs this kind of severe and abrupt punishment, because this is how strength of arms stands firm, which, when it falls away from the right course, will be subverted.\"\n\nThere are fewer records of elephants being used as straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by Josephus and the deuterocanonical book of 3 Maccabees in connection with the Egyptian Jews, though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by Ptolemy IV Philopator (ruled 221‚Äì204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of Dionysus. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants. The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took an altogether more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.\n\n"}

His parents were Ernesto Jurado Mart√≠nez and In√©s Noboa Castillo, both from Quito, and he was baptized in the El Bel√©n church on 21 January 1950 with the names Pablo Fernando Rodrigo. His father died when Jurado was still young. During his childhood he often travelled to Tulc√°n and San Juan de Pasto with his mother. It was on these journeys that he discovered his vocation for studying the societies of these cities.\n\nEven before he was old enough to go to school he showed a talent for drawing and he would occupy himself drawing the outlines of photographs of the previous century onto cardboard. This led to his interest in reconstructing his family history and that of the rest of the country.\n\nHe spent some months at Santa Cecilia kindergarten and between 1955 and 1961 he attended Espejo Municipal School. From the age of six years he was helped by his stepfather, Augusto Paz Proa√±o, who was associated with the socialist party of Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco Ibarra and who sparked Jurado Noboa‚Äôs interest in reading historical literature at the age of seven. His family were poor throughout his school years. In 1959, at a little over 9 years old, he won his first competition for historical writing and published his first article \"The imprisonment and death of Eugenio Espejo\".\n\nIn 1961, he went to Sebasti√°n de Benalc√°zar College and he also regularly visited the city‚Äôs public libraries. He was passionate about biographies and some years later in 1964 he became interested in genealogy as a result of his innate and insatiable curiosity regarding people‚Äôs fate. He won a book reading competition the same year.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1967 he became interested in public speaking and he won two intercollegiate competitions: the Human Rights Contest and the Oratory Competition organized by the Americas Project.\n\nIn 1966 he was declared Best Graduate among the biology students. At that time the Benalc√°zar was the best college in Quito.\n\nIn 1974 when the dictatorship was at the height of its power the military announced that the remains of Ecuador‚Äôs founding fathers had been found. Jurado maintained a debate with the establishment regarding this fact through the television and press which made the authorities look ridiculous and showed that many historians said one thing in public but another in private. This possibly led to the idea of founding a group of contemporaries to carry out research. He was already using a card catalogue for arranging data and although its organization had not yet been perfected it contained around a million cards with more than 16 million pieces of data, making it the most important private archive in the country.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1975, he studied Medicine at the Central University of Ecuador. He was a member of the School of Medicine Association.\n\nIn his second year at university he studied anatomy and during this time he completely ceased his historical research. In September 1969, the notable historian and genealogist Doctor Ezio Garay Arellano (who lived in Santiago de Guayaquil) introduced Jurado to Pedro Robles y Chambers who also lived in that city. The two developed a strong friendship and they would visit the country's regional archives whenever they were able. At this time he started his training at the Social Security Hospital that continued until his graduation. However, he never attained the same level of knowledge regarding the history and genealogy of the city of Guayaquil and its surrounding area as Garay had.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1973, Jurado undertook clinical training under Doctors Asanza, Eduardo Villac√≠s, Max Ontaneda and Hern√°n Proa√±o, who gave him a wide range of clinical experience. In 1969 he became a member of the Faculty Board and Board of Directors of Medicine.\n\nIn 1970 he started to collaborate with the magazine ‚ÄúHistorical Museum‚Äù that was edited by Hugo Moncayo. In 1971 he published his research in the Bulletin of the National Academy of History as well as maintaining correspondence with specialists both within and outside the country. In 1970 and later in 1973, he travelled to Colombia for research purposes. He spent part of 1972 in Peru, broadening his historical and genealogical knowledge. In 1973, he was admitted to the Academy of History, at that time he was the youngest member to be given that honour.\n\nIn 1974 he was the representative for his faculty at the International Congress on Paediatrics in Quito.\n\nIn 1975 he started to revise Quito‚Äôs protocol archives and he graduated in medicine with honours as second in his year group.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1976, Jurado completed his year of rural medicine in Guasuntos, in the south of Chimborazo Province. The local population contained three distinct social levels that were in constant conflict. These circumstances encouraged him to investigate the sociological basis for the formation of different classes.\n\nAfter visiting France, Switzerland, Austria and Italy he travelled to Spain where he carried out research in Madrid and more particularly in Andaluc√≠a. At the end of 1976 he was admitted for a year to the University of Pamplona as a post-graduate in psychiatry, following a recommendation by Father Jos√© Reig Satorres. However, after six months he became a member of a team that went to study to the formation of the first psychiatric hospital in Spain to use English methods. Jurado redesigned the programme by shortening it and he co-authored a book on his experiences called ‚ÄúPsychiatric Assistance in Navarra‚Äù. That same year he carried out further research in the north of the peninsula. He was made Head of the Psychiatric Department at the Institute in 1978.\n\nHe married Elena Piqueras Esparza on 11 August of the same year with whom he had three children.\n\nHe was also a Professor of pre and post graduate studies in the psychology of tourism at the Spanish Institute of Tourism. In 1979 he was Head of Psychiatry and also of Residents a second time.\n\nJurado founded the National Centre for Genealogical and Anthropological Studies (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Geneal√≥gicas y Antropol√≥gicas, CENIGA) in 1975, along with Jos√© Freile Larrea and his sons Juan and Carlos Freile Granizo.\n\nHe was named as Director of CENIGA and produced the first three journals published by the society. Along with the guayaquile√±o traditionalist Rodolfo P√©rez Pimentel Jurado organised the First Ecuadorian Genealogy Conference, which unfortunately was a failure.\n\nSpain offered Jurado a promising future but his Ecuadorian roots meant that he missed his home country. In the last year of his residency he spent many hours in the public library making a thorough examination of the 88 volumes of the genealogy encyclopaedia produced by Arturo Garc√≠a Carrafa. His experiences during his time in Spain had made him less Hispanophile than he had been on his arrival. His training is the social sciences had given him a new way of seeing things and he started to slowly develop a more mestizo conception of culture in South America.\n\nHe arrived back in Ecuador in September 1979 with the intention of revolutionizing psychiatry, which he considered to be the most backward of the specialist medical disciplines in his country. However, he did not ingratiate himself with his peers and in January 1980 he went into practice by himself in Ambato. He also started to contribute medical and historical articles to the local newspaper \"El Heraldo\".\n\nIn March of that year he gained the position of Psychiatric Researcher for the Institute of Criminology in Quito. In addition he wrote a column on mental health for newspapers in Ambato and for the magazine \"Desde el Surco\". In the latter part of 1980 he reorganized and updated diagnostic procedures and methods of treatment at the Hospital Julio Endara to improve their scientific quality and efficacy.\n\nFrom September 1980 until the end of 1982 he had a punishing work schedule in trying to balance his professional and intellectual interests. He would start work at 7am at the National Historical Archives where he collaborated on research work with Alfredo Costales on indigenous peoples, he also lectured at Marianas College. From 11am until 1pm he taught at La Inmaculada. From 2pm until 4pm he worked as a criminologist. He returned to the National Archive between 4pm and 6pm. He then gave private consultations between 6pm and 9pm. In addition, on two days of the week he taught psychopathology at the Central University.\n\nIn 1981 Jurado, with the help of some of his students, carried out the first investigations into the consumption of marihuana in Quito and weekend binge drinking.\n\nBy 1982 he came to understand that not all genealogists could work together and that ideological differences within an organization can prove a distraction. Therefore in January 1983 he resigned from CENIGA to found the Friends of Genealogy Society with Costales and Enrique Mu√±oz Larrea. Ecuadorian genealogy was therefore split into two areas, an obsolete, elitist, traditionalist side and a progressive, social side.\n\nIn 1983, Jurado published three magazines with the new society, which proved to be such a success that three editions had to be published of each one. The families studied were of little interest to professional genealogists but they were popular with the magazine-buying public. Jurado published his classic work \"Las coyas y pallas del Tahuantinsuyo\". The initial print run of five thousand copies sold out straight away. Oswaldo Viteri helped with the artistic and philosophical conception of racial mixing and Xerox of Ecuador published a number of editions.\n\nThat same year the town of Ambato designated Jurado as its Official Chronicler. In addition the local press published three of his books: ‚ÄúThemes in the History of Ambato‚Äù (\"Temas de la historia de Ambato\"), ‚ÄúAmbatonian Chronicles‚Äù (\"Cr√≥nicas de la ambate√±√≠a\") and ‚ÄúBiographic Dictionary of the Tungurahua\" (\"Diccionario biogr√°fico del Tungurahua\"), of which only the first 50 pages were ever published. He resigned from the post of Official Chronicler after two years, as he did not want to dependant on the local authorities. His reasoning was that he would be ‚Äúless enlightened but more pedantic‚Äù. However, as the post is for life he retains the title.\n\nBy the end of 1983 he no longer worked in Ambato. From July of that year he published the SAG Collection with Servimpress up until 1992.\n\nThe success of this collection gave him the idea of increasing it to fifty volumes. He has currently exceeded this number making it the country‚Äôs largest, most important and most successful cultural collection.\n\nJurado was accepted into the Medicinal History Academy in 1984 for his study entitled ‚ÄúDoctors and Medicine during Independence‚Äù (\"Los M√©dicos y la Medicina durante la independencia\"). He was also a member of the organizing committee of the International Criminology Congress that took place in Quito. He also published a study entitled ‚ÄúThe descendants of Benalc√°zar in Ecuadorian social formation\" (\"Los descendientes de Benalc√°zar en la formaci√≥n social ecuatoriana\") in eight volumes. That same year he made contact with Colombian historians to discuss genealogy. This collaboration gave rise to the formation of CEGAS in San Juan de Pasto in 1985 and to the First International Genealogy Congress at the end of that year.\n\nJurado formed the Guayas branch of SAG in 1985 with the help of Ezio Garay. Many Ecuadorian genealogists, and those from abroad as well, started to value data found in Census, Church records (capellan√≠as and dispensas), anecdotes and family traditions which are all elements that Jurado has promoted through he work and throughout his many years of experience. This same year he returned to Spain for a meeting of psychiatrists who trained at Navarra University. He also undertook research in Spain and Portugal.\n\nIn 1986 he organized the 3rd International Genealogy Congress that took place in Quito with representatives from five countries.\n\nTo date he has more than 300 published titles both in the areas of history and medicine. He collaborates with the ‚ÄúGuayaquil University Magazine‚Äù, \"Preg√≥n\" which is published in Medill√≠n, the ‚ÄúBulletin of the National Academy of History‚Äù, Friends of Genealogy Society Magazine‚Äù, SAG, and ‚ÄúMedical Updates‚Äù and he is a member of its assessment committee. He also publishes articles in ‚ÄúMessenger‚Äù, the \"Institute of Criminology Magazine‚Äù, the ‚ÄúDiners Information Bulletin‚Äù and the ‚ÄúCulture Magazine‚Äù which is published by the Central Bank.\n\nAlong with Hern√°n Rodr√≠guez Castelo he is considered to be one of the foremost Ecuadorian researchers of all time.\n\nFrom the start Jurado‚Äôs work has represented a breakthrough in the dissemination of historical information in Ecuador. He has always tried to avoid prejudices that do not fit with the facts. He gives genealogy a general focus that is accessible to all social classes.\n\nAll his works reflect the multi-ethnic origins of all Ecuadorians. The contributions of Indians, Africans, Arabs and Jews in Europe and Spain are a common factor in his books, articles and lectures. A number of his books chart the rise and fall of various Ecuadorian families as social mobility is a constant in the social dynamic throughout history.\n\nFernando Jurado Noboa has been one of the most prolific historic researchers in Ecuador and he has published a large number of works. The following is an incomplete list of his works.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14104519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14104519", "title": "Historic paint analysis", "text": "Historic paint analysis\n\nHistoric paint analysis is the scientific analysis of architectural finishes, including not only paints but also metallic finishes and clear and translucent finishes used on historic buildings. The primary purpose of such analysis is to determine the color of the finish used at a particular time in the building's history, usually the original construction, but not always. Secondary purposes include determination of ingredients such as media (water, oil, latex, etc.) and pigments (organic pigments, inorganic pigments, dyes, etc.). Paint analysis is also used at times as a dating technique for various building elements.\n\nTypical problems encountered in historic paint analysis include such things as paint loss, surface deterioration, newer materials, substrates, delamination, media and pigment deterioration, and alligatoring.\n\nHistoric architectural paint analysis finds its roots in the early twentieth century in the United States. The historic preservation movement began in 1849 with the preservation of Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington. Early preservationists began to realize that paints and finishes which had survived were very important but may not have been the original, or historic, finishes. Interest in historic wallpapers also developed with the interest in historic paint and color. One of the earliest endeavors came with the restoration of Williamsburg, Virginia funded by John D. Rockefeller in the 1920s. Early investigations by simple scraping of the finishes by Susan Nash of the surviving original buildings yielded a palette that became popularly known as Williamsburg colors. \n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s serious efforts at investigating original paint colors were underway at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia by architect Penelope Hartshorne Batcheler. Her pioneering efforts introduced, for the first time in this country, the use of a stereo microscope to more closely examine the 18th century paints at Independence Hall. Batcheler also introduced the use of the Munsell Color System for matching and referencing original paint colors. Her landmark publication, \"Paint Color Research and Restoration\", was the very first publication concerning the analysis of historic architectural paints for determination of original colors. At the same time, in the United Kingdom, microscopy of paint samples was developed by Joyce Plesters of the National Gallery, London who worked mainly with easel paintings but also with samples from wall-paintings.\n\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s Morgan W. Phillips at the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA) became involved with historic paint and color analysis, specifically at the Harrison Gray Otis House in Boston. At the same time, E. Blaine Cliver, Historical Architect, who originally worked with Batcheler at the National Park Service (NPS) in Philadelphia, then with the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington, DC and later at the Northeast Regional Office of the NPS, became involved with historic paint analysis, especially in a laboratory in Building 28 of the former Boston Navy Yard. In the early 1970s, Frank S. Welsh joined the NPS in Philadelphia and began his research and study of historic paints with Penelope Batcheler, where he introduced the use of the National Bureau of Standards Color Name Charts, (NIST) for naming the colors matched to the Munsell Color System. Welsh also was the first to introduce the term \"paint analysis\" into the lexicon of historic preservation. As an independent historic paint color consultant one of his first major projects was Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson. In the mid 1970s, Matthew J. Mosca started working for the National Trust with Blaine Cliver. Later, as a preservation consultant, Mosca researched the historic colors of Mount Vernon.\n\nThe advances in the science of paint color research by these individuals suggested that the popular Williamsburg colors had been matched to faded and aged finishes. During the 1980s and 1990s Colonial Williamsburg consulted with Welsh to undertake a comprehensive paint and color analysis on numerous buildings in the historic area. In his research, \"the first modern scientific paint analysis\" there, confirmed that the Williamsburg color palette did not represent the actual historic colors. In addition he found that in many cases their early efforts had mistakenly matched later paint layers, some nineteenth-century.\n\nHistorically, paint analysis was done on site by carefully removing later paint layers to reveal a sequence of finishes down to the substrate. This was the methodology employed during the early restoration of finishes at Historic Williamsburg. Although this method is employed by a few practitioners, it is not common because of its inherent problems of misinterpretation and failure to address issues such as paint ageing and discoloration. Because finishes analysis is performed under laboratory conditions samples are collected in the field for later analysis and can be collected by the analyst or by his client who then ships them to him.\n\nThe primary purposes of analysis are to determine historic finishes and to determine principle components such as media or basic pigments. There are two methodologies in the preparation of paint samples for microscopic analysis. The first, which is derived from the medical world, is to treat the sample as a specimen and set it into a fixed position in a permanent medium such as paraffin. The specimen is then ground to a flat finish, providing a horizontal surface for viewing under a microscope. The second is to leave the samples in a loose condition with their broken surfaces which then can be manipulated under the microscope to permit a variety of views of the layers. The primary disadvantage to the first method is that the grinding process tends to blur layers together, especially layers of similar or identical colors. It also provide only a single, fixed point of viewing. The second method lacks these disadvantages, although skill and experience is required to manipulate the samples effectively.\n\nFollowing preparation of the samples, they are typically viewed under an optical microscope using either natural north light or polarized artificial light simulating natural north light. North light is essential in order to render the colors accurately without the effects of the yellow spectrum of direct sunlight. Each individual layer is identified and, typically, matched to the Munsell color system. The Munsell color system is a scientific system in which colors have been ranged into a color fan based upon three attributes: hue or color, the chroma or color saturation, and the value or neutral lightness or darkness. Unlike color systems developed by paint manufacturers, the Munsell system provides an unchanging standard of reference which is unaffected by the marketplace and changing tastes in colors.\n\nThe hue notation, the color, indicates the relation of the sample to a visually equally spaced scale of 100 hues. There are 10 major hues, five principal and five intermediate within this scale. The hues are identified by initials indicating the central member of the group: red R, yellow-red YR, yellow Y, yellow-green YG, green G, blue-green BG, blue B, purple-blue PB, purple P, and red-purple PR. The hues in each group are identified by the numbers 1 to 10. The most purplish of the red hues, 1 on the scale of 100, is designated as 1R, the most yellowish as 10R, and the central hue as 5R. The hue 10R can also be expressed as 10, 5Y as 25, and so forth if a notation of the hue as a number is desired. Chroma indicates the degree of departure of a given hue from the neutral gray axis of the same value. It is the strength of saturation of color from neutral gray, written /0 to /14 or further for maximum color saturation.\n\nValue, or lightness, makes up the neutral gray axis of the color wheel, ranging from black, number 1, to white at the top of the axis, number 10. A visual value can be approximated by the help of the neutral gray chips of the Rock or Soil Color chart with ten intervals. The color parameters can be expressed with figures semi-quantitatively as: hue, value/chroma (H, V/C). The color \"medium red\" should serve as an example for presentation with the three color attributes, 5R 5.5/6. This means that 5R is located in the middle of the red hue, 5.5 is the lightness of Munsell value near the middle between light and dark, and 6 is the degree of the Munsell chroma, or the color saturation, which is about in the middle of the saturation scale.\n\n\n"}

Jean entered the church and became a canon of the cathedral church, but he and his brother Henri followed Jean de Beaumont to England in 1327, and took part in the border warfare against the Scots. His will is dated 1369, and his epitaph gives the date of his death as 1370. Nothing more is known of his life, but Jacques de Hemricourt, author of the \"Miroir des nobles de Hesbaye\", has left a eulogy of his character, and a description of the magnificence of his attire, his retinue and his hospitality. Hemricourt asserts that he was eighty years old or more when he died.\n\nFor a long time Jean was only known as a chronicler through a reference by Jean Froissart, who quotes him in the prologue of his first book as one of his authorities. A fragment of his work in the manuscript of Jean d'Outremeuse's \"Ly Myreur des Histors\", was discovered in 1847; and the whole of his chronicle, preserved in the library of Ch√°lons-sur-Marne, was edited in 1863 by L. Polain.\n\nJean was one of the first chroniclers to write in French instead of Latin. He was a soldier and companion of Jean, Count de Beaumont and travelled with him to England and Scotland in 1327. At the request of the duke, he wrote \"Vrayes Chroniques\" (\"True Chronicles\"), which recorded the events of the reign of Edward III. He is believed to be the first person to use interviews to confirm and supplement his facts. Jean gives as his reason for writing a desire to replace a certain misleading rhymed chronicle of the wars of Edward III by a true relation of his enterprises down to the beginning of the Hundred Years' War.\n\nJean Froissart was greatly influenced by him and borrowed from his texts. Jean entered the church and became a canon of the cathedral church, but he and his brother Henri followed Jean de Beaumont to England in 1327 and took part in the border warfare against the Scots.

Nothing more is known of his life, but Jacques de Hemricourt, author of the \"Miroir des nobles de Hesbaye\" (\"Mirror of the Nobles of Hesbaye\"), has left a eulogy of his character, and a description of the magnificence of his attire, his retinue and his hospitality.\n\nIn the matter of style Le Bel has been placed by some critics on the level of Froissart. His chief merit is his refusal to narrate events unless either he himself or his informant had witnessed them. This scrupulousness in the acceptance of evidence must be set against his limitations. He takes on the whole a similar point of view to Froissart's; he has no concern with national movements or politics; and, writing for the public of chivalry, he preserves no general notion of a campaign, which resolves itself in his narrative into a series of exploits on the part of his heroes. Froissart was considerably indebted to him, and seems to have borrowed from him some of his best-known episodes, such as the death of Robert the Bruce, Edward III, and the countess of Salisbury, and the devotion of the burghers of Calais. The songs and virelais, in the art of writing which he was, according to Hemricourt, an expert, have not come to light.\n"}

Johannes' uncle Andreas received a property at P√Ωr as a donation from King Sigismund of Luxembourg, and Johannes' father Peter inherited this estate.\n\nThurocz was educated in a Premonstratensian monastery in Ipolys√°g (now ≈†ahy, Slovakia), where he studied Latin and law. In 1465 he appeared in Buda, as a prosecutor of the Premonstratensian monastery of Ipolys√°g. From 1467 to 1475 he served as a notary of the judge royal Ladislaus P√°l√≥ci, from 1476 to 1486 as the main notary of the judge royal Stephen B√°thory at the royal court, and from 1486 to 1488 as a head notary and judge of the royal personnel clerk Thomas Dr√°gi. No evidence of any university studies has been preserved, and it is possible that the title in front of his name was merely a polite title for an official or civil servant.\n\nThurocz's chronicle was written in three main parts:\n\n\nAccording to his own words in the work's dedication, Thurocz had no ambitions as an historian. In fact, his chronicle contains many errors and omits a number of significant events. Besides more reliable sources, the work relies extensively on oral tradition, folk songs and anecdotes, and contains many references to \"miraculous\" events and wonders.\n\nDestiny and fortune play a significant role in history as seen by Thurocz. Like many of his contemporaries he was convinced of the close relationship between human fortune, historical events and the motion of celestial bodies.\n\nThurocz sought an explanation of a number of events in the moral imperative. He gave much attention to describing the inner feelings of historical characters, but had an evident tendency to idealize the Hungarian heroes Attila and Matthias Corvinus, while downplaying the significance of Hungary's queens.\n\nThe first editions of Chronica Hungarorum were published in 1488 in Brno, (Moravia) and Augsburg. Further editions followed over the following centuries in Frankfurt, Vienna, Nagyszombat and Buda.\n\nExtant early editions include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1605951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1605951", "title": "Limelight Department", "text": "Limelight Department\n\nThe Limelight Department was one of the world's first film studios, beginning in 1898, operated by The Salvation Army in Melbourne, Australia. The Limelight Department produced evangelistic material for use by the Salvation Army, including lantern slides as early as 1891, as well as private and government contracts. In its 19 years of operation, the Limelight Department produced about 300 films of various lengths, making it one of largest film producers of its time.\n\nThe Salvation Army Limelight Department unofficially started in 1891, when Adjutant Joseph Perry started a photographic studio in Ballarat, Victoria, to supplement the income of the Salvation Army's Prison Gate Home. At the time, Perry was on compassionate leave from active ministry, as his wife Annie had died earlier that year, leaving Perry to raise their three children. In September 1891, Perry was temporarily reassigned to the Australasian Headquarters in Melbourne to assist Australasian commander, Commissioner Thomas Coombs, in putting together a presentation of General William Booth's \"In Darkest England\" program. At this stage, Perry was using lantern slides which projected hand coloured photographs onto a large screen. Coombs was impressed by the quality and effectiveness of presentation, making Perry's move to Melbourne permanent. The Limelight Department was officially established on 11 June 1892.\nIn 1896, when Commissioner Coombs was replaced as Australasian commander by General Booth‚Äôs youngest son, 'Commandant Herbert Booth. Booth immediately warmed to the innovation of the Limelight Department, giving Perry the freedom and the financial support to expand into the newly developing medium of film. Under Booth‚Äôs direction, Perry started work on \"Social Salvation\" in 1898, one of the first presentations of its type to integrate the traditional lantern slides with film segments. On 20 December 1899, the Limelight Department premiered a series on the \"Passion\" at the Collingwood corps. The presentation contained thirteen, ninety second sections which portrayed the life of Jesus from birth to death. The presentation was similar in style to that produced by the Lumiere Company earlier that year, however, as none of the original film remains, it can never be determined if the Limelight Department used Lumiere footage in the presentation.\n\nThe major innovation of the Limelight Department would come in 1899 when Booth and Perry began work on \"Soldiers of the Cross\", arguably the first feature-length film (see the last section, below).\n\nThe presentation contained fifteen ninety-second sections and two hundred lantern slides, and ran for nearly two and a half hours. While some Lumiere footage was used in the opening passion sequence of the film, the majority of the footage was filmed in Melbourne, either in the attic of 69 Bourke Street, on the tennis court of the Murrumbeena Girls Home, or in the pool at Richmond Baths.\n\nThe presentation itself focused of the lives and deaths of early Christian martyrs and cost ¬£550 to produce. The scenes were considered extremely violent for their time, including such images as the stoning of Stephen, the burning of Polycarp and unnamed Christians being tortured, beheaded, killed by gladiators, drowned, or burned alive. The presentation included a cast of 150 Salvation Army officers who were stationed in Melbourne at the time. The many death scenes took their toll, with the cast suffering various injuries, including scorched hair and eyebrows from the fires used. The presentation premiered on 13 September 1901, at the Melbourne Town Hall, to a crowd somewhere between three and four thousand. One reviewer spoke of how the death scenes caused several women to faint in the aisles.\n\n\"Soldiers of the Cross\" fortified the Limelight Department as a major player in the early film industry. However, \"Soldiers of the Cross\" would be dwarfed by \"Inauguration of the Australian Commonwealth\", when the Limelight Department was commissioned to film the 1901 Federation of Australia. It was the hope of the New South Wales government that the film would prove an imperishable record of the event, though little of the footage still exists. Perry set up five cameras at various point of the procession route and had to use a fire carriage to move quickly from one camera to the next.\n\nIn order that \"Soldiers of the Cross\" could be seen by a wide audience, the Limelight Department created groups known as Biorama Companies. Teams of musicians, lecturers, and projectionists would travel throughout Australia presenting the material that the Limelight Department had produced. Screenings were generally held in local halls, but it was the Biorama Companies sometimes used the sides of buildings as screens so that passersby could see it. When Herbert left the Salvation Army (taking the original \"Soldiers of the Cross\" material with him), he was replaced by Commissioner Thomas McKie. McKie encouraged the expansion of the Limelight Department, the creation of additional Biorama Companies and even the reshooting of \"Soldiers of the Cross\" in 1909, titled \"Heroes of the Cross\". In addition to the evangelical material produced for the Biorama Companies, the Limelight produced many films for private clients and the government. Some of the most notable of these were films showing the royal visit of the Duke and Duchess of York for the opening of the first sitting of the Parliament of Australia (the session itself could not be filmed due to poor lighting), the visit of America's Great White Fleet, and the Victoria's Second Boer War Contingent leaving South Africa. Engaging in such private contracts was a way in which the Limelight Department raised capital to support its operation and the operation of other Salvation Army programs.\n\nIn 1910, McKie was replaced as the Australasian commander by a more conservative Commissioner named James Hay. Hay felt that cinema was not something that the church should be involved in and he shut down the Limelight Department at the height of its operation. In his autobiography \"Aggressive Salvationism\", Hay wrote ‚Äôthe cinema, as conducted by The Salvation Army, had led to weakness and a lightness incompatible with true Salvationism and was completely ended by me.‚Äô\n\nFor many years, a question mark has hung over the question of whether \"Soldiers of the Cross\" should be counted as the first feature film. The issues of concern are basically length of the footage, length of the presentation, and the continuity of the storyline.\n\nA feature film is generally defined as running for over sixty minutes with a constant storyline running throughout. Placed end to end, the film footage in \"Soldiers of the Cross\" equals twenty-two and a half minutes, falling short of the time requirements. Furthermore, the film did not have one long story, but rather a collection of short stories which also seems to disqualify it from contention. However, it has been argued that as the entire presentation, including films strips, lantern slides and live sections, runs for over two hours, \"Soldiers of the Cross\" should be considered a feature film.\n\nIn 1902, the year after \"Soldiers of the Cross\" was made, the Limelight Department produced \"Under Southern Skies\", a film examining life in Australia from European Settlement to Federation. This film ran about one hundred minutes but as it is a documentary, not a dramatised story, it is not considered to be a feature film. \"Heroes of the Cross\" ran for about 75 minutes and contained a more defined story thread than its predecessor; however, it was produced in 1909, three years after \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" (1906) which is considered by most people to be the actual first feature film, including the Australian Film Commission.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17875510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17875510", "title": "Multiple discovery", "text": "Multiple discovery\n\nThe concept of multiple discovery (also known as simultaneous invention) is the hypothesis that most scientific discoveries and inventions are made independently and more or less simultaneously by multiple scientists and inventors. The concept of multiple discovery opposes a traditional view‚Äîthe \"heroic theory\" of invention and discovery.\n\nWhen Nobel laureates are announced annually‚Äîespecially in physics, chemistry, physiology, medicine, and economics‚Äîincreasingly, in the given field, rather than just a single laureate, there are two, or the maximally permissible three, who often have independently made the same discovery.\n\nHistorians and sociologists have remarked on the occurrence, in science, of \"multiple independent discovery\". Robert K. Merton defined such \"multiples\" as instances in which similar discoveries are made by scientists working independently of each other. Merton contrasted a \"multiple\" with a \"singleton\"‚Äîa discovery that has been made uniquely by a single scientist or group of scientists working together. As Merton said, \"Sometimes the discoveries are simultaneous or almost so; sometimes a scientist will make a new discovery which, unknown to him, somebody else has made years before.\"\n\nCommonly cited examples of multiple independent discovery are the 17th-century independent formulation of calculus by Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and others, described by A. Rupert Hall; the 18th-century discovery of oxygen by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Joseph Priestley, Antoine Lavoisier and others; and the theory of evolution of species, independently advanced in the 19th century by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. What holds for discoveries, also goes for inventions. Examples are the blast furnace (invented independently in China, Europe and Africa), the crossbow (invented independently in China, Greece, Africa, northern Canada, and the Baltic countries), and magnetism (discovered independently in Greece, China, and India).\n\nMultiple independent discovery, however, is not limited to only a few historic instances involving giants of scientific research. Merton believed that it is multiple discoveries, rather than unique ones, that represent the \"common\" pattern in science.\n\nMultiple discoveries in the history of science provide evidence for evolutionary models of science and technology, such as memetics (the study of self-replicating units of culture), evolutionary epistemology (which applies the concepts of biological evolution to study of the growth of human knowledge), and cultural selection theory (which studies sociological and cultural evolution in a Darwinian manner).\n\nA recombinant-DNA-inspired \"paradigm of paradigms\" has been posited, that describes a mechanism of \"recombinant conceptualization.\" This paradigm predicates that a new concept arises through the crossing of pre-existing concepts and facts. This is what is meant when one says that a scientist or artist has been \"influenced by\" another‚Äîetymologically, that a concept of the latter's has \"flowed into\" the mind of the former. Not every new concept so formed will be viable: adapting social Darwinist Herbert Spencer's phrase, only the fittest concepts survive.\n\nMultiple independent discovery and invention, like discovery and invention generally, have been fostered by the evolution of means of communication: roads, vehicles, sailing vessels, writing, printing, institutions of education, reliable postal services, telegraphy, and mass media, including the internet. Gutenberg's invention of printing (which itself involved a number of discrete inventions) substantially facilitated the transition from the Middle Ages to modern times. All these communication developments have catalyzed and accelerated the process of recombinant conceptualization, and thus also of multiple independent discovery.\n\nMultiple independent discoveries show an increased incidence beginning in the 17th century. This may accord with the thesis of British philosopher A.C. Grayling that the 17th century was crucial in the creation of the modern world view, freed from the shackles of religion, the occult, and uncritical faith in the authority of Aristotle. Grayling speculates that Europe's Thirty Years' War (1618-48), with the concomitant breakdown of authority, made freedom of thought and open debate possible, so that modern science rests on the heads of millions of dead. He also notes the importance of the development of a reliable postal service in enabling savants to be in scholarly communication; the cooperative approach, first recommended by Francis Bacon, was essential to making science open to peer review and public verification, and not just a matter of the lone individual issuing idiosyncratic pronouncements.\"\n\nThe paradigm of recombinant conceptualization (see above)‚Äîmore broadly, of recombinant occurrences‚Äîthat explains multiple discovery in science and the arts, also elucidates the phenomenon of historic recurrence, wherein similar events are noted in the histories of countries widely separated in time and geography. It is the recurrence of patterns that lends a degree of prognostic power‚Äîand, thus, additional scientific validity‚Äîto the findings of history.\n\nLamb and Easton, and others, have argued that science and art are similar with regard to multiple discovery. When two scientists independently make the same discovery, their papers are not word-for-word identical, but the core ideas in the papers are the same; likewise, two novelists may independently write novels with the same core themes, though their novels are not identical word-for-word.\n\nDiscoverers understandably take pleasure in their accomplishments and generally seek to claim primacy to their discoveries. When it transpires that a discovery has multiple originators, they may either agree to share the credit or insist on their own exclusive primacy.\n\nAfter Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz had exchanged information on their respective systems of calculus in the 1670s, Newton in the first edition of his \"Principia\" (1687), in a \"scholium\", apparently accepted Leibniz's independent discovery of calculus. In 1699, however, a Swiss mathematician suggested to Britain's Royal Society that Leibniz had borrowed his calculus from Newton. In 1705 Leibniz, in an anonymous review of Newton's \"Opticks\", implied that Newton's \"fluxions\" (Newton's term for differential calculus) were an adaptation of Leibniz's calculus. In 1712 the Royal Society appointed a committee to examine the documents in question; the same year, the Society published a report, written by Newton himself, asserting his priority. Soon after Leibniz died in 1716, Newton denied that his own 1687 \"Principia\" scholium \"allowed [Leibniz] the invention of the \"calculus differentialis\" independently of my own\"; and the third edition of Newton's \"Principia\" (1726) omitted the tell-tale scholium. It is now accepted that Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus independently of each other.\n\nIn another classic case of multiple discovery, the two discoverers showed more civility. By June 1858 Charles Darwin had completed over two-thirds of his \"On the Origin of Species\" when he received a startling letter from a naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, 13 years his junior, with whom he had corresponded. The letter summarized Wallace's theory of natural selection, with conclusions identical to Darwin's own. Darwin turned for advice to his friend Charles Lyell, the foremost geologist of the day. Lyell proposed that Darwin and Wallace prepare a joint communication to the scientific community. Darwin being preoccupied with his mortally ill youngest son, Lyell enlisted Darwin's closest friend, Joseph Hooker, director of Kew Gardens, and together on 1 July 1858 they presented to the Linnean Society a joint paper that brought together Wallace's abstract with extracts from Darwin's earlier, 1844 essay on the subject. The paper was also published that year in the Society's journal. Neither the public reading of the joint paper nor its publication attracted the least interest; but Wallace, \"admirably free from envy or jealousy,\" had been content to remain in Darwin's shadow.\n\n\n"}

The interviewees come from a variety of backgrounds and places but are all lesbians over the age of 70.\n\nThe Old Lesbians Organizing for Change were founded in 1987 in response to the blatant combination of ageism and sexism in regards to older lesbians. The initial meeting was inspired by the publication of Look Me in the Eye: Old Women, Aging and Ageism by Barbara Macdonald and Cynthia Rich in 1983, 4 years prior. The goal of the organization is to \"confront ageism in our communities and our country\" through education and public discourse. They were a major presence at a variety of national lesbian events such as the National Lesbian Conference in Atlanta in 1991 hosted by the Atlanta Lesbian Feminist Alliance and the March on Washington. Supporters may be of any age and younger individuals warmly welcomed, however the minimum age of membership is 60 years old.

Originally created by Arden Eversmeyer the project seeks to expose the life stories of women from past generations, including images and other supplementary documents. Eversmeyer was inspired to gather these oral histories when she observed friends passing away in her area and was concerned that their stories would never be shared. While subjects such as feminism and civil rights are touched upon in many of the interviews, there is no common focus other than the shared experience of old lesbians. Much of the material is purely autobiographical in nature.\n\n"}
{"id": "24297671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24297671", "title": "Popular music", "text": "Popular music\n\nPopular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \"folk\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.\n\nThe original application of the term is to music of the 1880s Tin Pan Alley period in the United States. Although popular music sometimes is known as \"pop music\", the two terms are not interchangeable. Popular music is a generic term for a wide variety of genres of music that appeal to the tastes of a large segment of the population, whereas pop music usually refers to a specific musical genre \"within\" popular music. Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable melodies. The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections, with the verse and chorus or refrain repeating throughout the song and the bridge providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece.\n\nIn the 2000s, with songs and pieces available as digital sound files, it has become easier for music to spread from one country or region to another. Some popular music forms have become global, while others have a wide appeal within the culture of their origin. Through the mixture of musical genres, new popular music forms are created to reflect the ideals of a global culture. The examples of Africa, Indonesia, and the Middle East show how Western pop music styles can blend with local musical traditions to create new hybrid styles.\n\nScholars have classified music as \"popular\" based on various factors, including whether a song or piece becomes known to listeners mainly from hearing the music (in contrast with classical music, in which many musicians learn pieces from sheet music); its appeal to diverse listeners, its treatment as a marketplace commodity in a capitalist context, and other factors. Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure. Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted. Evaluating appeal based on size of audience (mass appeal) or whether audience is of a certain social class is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music. Moreover, \"understandings of popular music have changed with time\". Middleton argues that if research were to be done on the field of popular music, there would be a level of stability within societies to characterize historical periods, distribution of music, and the patterns of influence and continuity within the popular styles of music.\n\nAnahid Kassabian separated popular music into four categories; \"popular as populist,\" or having overtones of liberation and expression; \"popular as folk,\" or stating that the music is written by the people, for themselves; \"popular as counterculture,\" or empowering citizens to act against the oppression they face; and \"popular as mass,\" or the music becomes the tool for oppression. A society's popular music reflects the ideals that are prevalent at the time it is performed or published. David Riesman states that the youth audiences of popular music fit into either a majority group or a subculture. The majority group listens to the commercially produced styles while the subcultures find a minority style to transmit their own values. This allows youth to choose what music they identify with, which gives them power as consumers to control the market of popular music.\n\nForm in popular music is most often sectional, the most common sections being verse, chorus or refrain, and bridge. Other common forms include thirty-two-bar form, chorus form *(Middleton pg 30), and twelve-bar blues. Popular music songs are rarely composed using different music for each stanza of the lyrics (songs composed in this fashion are said to be \"through-composed\").\n\nThe verse and chorus are considered the primary elements. Each verse usually has the same melody (possibly with some slight modifications), but the lyrics change for most verses. The chorus (or \"refrain\") usually has a melodic phrase and a key lyrical line which is repeated. Pop songs may have an introduction and coda (\"tag\"), but these elements are not essential to the identity of most songs. Pop songs that use verses and choruses often have a bridge, which, as its name suggests, is a section which connects the verse and chorus at one or more points in the song.\n\nThe verse and chorus are usually repeated throughout a song, while the bridge, intro, and coda (also called an \"outro\") tend to be used only once. Some pop songs may have a solo section, particularly in rock or blues-influenced pop. During the solo section, one or more instruments play a melodic line which may be the melody used by the singer, or, in blues- or jazz-influenced pop, the solo may be improvised based on the chord progression. A solo usually features a single instrumental performer (e.g., a guitarist or a harmonica player) or less commonly, more than one instrumentalist (e.g., a trumpeter and a sax player).\n\nThirty-two-bar form uses four sections, most often eight measures long each (4√ó8=32), two verses or A sections, a contrasting B section (the bridge or \"middle-eight\") and a return of the verse in one last A section (AABA). Verse-chorus form or ABA form may be combined with AABA form, in compound AABA forms. Variations such as a1 and a2 can also be used. The repetition of one chord progression may mark off the only section in a simple verse form such as the twelve bar blues.\n\n\"The most significant feature of the emergent popular music industry of the late 18th and early 19th centuries was the extent of its focus on the commodity form of sheet music\". The availability of inexpensive, widely available sheet music versions of popular songs and instrumental music pieces made it possible for music to be disseminated to a wide audience of amateur, middle-class music-makers, who could play and sing popular music at home. Amateur music-making in the 19th century often centred around the piano, as this instrument could play melodies, chords and basslines, thus enabling a pianist to reproduce popular songs and pieces. In addition to the influence of sheet music, another factor was the increasing availability during the late 18th and early 19th century of public popular music performances in \"pleasure gardens and dance halls, popular theatres and concert rooms\".\n\nThe early popular music performers worked hand-in-hand with the sheet music industry to promote popular sheet music. One of the early popular music performers to attain widespread popularity was a Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind, who toured the US in the mid-19th century. In addition to living room amateur music-making during the 19th century, more people began getting involved in music during this era by participating in amateur choirs, joining brass bands or playing in amateur orchestras.\n\nThe centre of the music publishing industry in the US during the late 19th century was in New York's 'Tin Pan Alley' district. The Tin Pan Alley music publishers developed a new method for promoting sheet music: incessant promotion of new songs. One of the technological innovations that helped to spread popular music around the turn of the century was player pianos. A player piano could be used to record a skilled pianist's rendition of a piano piece. This recorded performance could be \"played back\" on another player piano. This allowed a larger number of music lovers to hear the new popular piano tunes. By the early 1900s, the big trends in popular music were the increasing popularity of vaudeville theaters and dance halls and a new invention‚Äîthe gramophone player. The record industry grew very rapidly; \"By 1920 there were almost 80 record companies in Britain, and almost 200 in the USA\". The availability of records enabled a larger percentage of the population to hear the top singers and bands.\n\nRadio broadcasting of music, which began in the early 1920s, helped to spread popular songs to a huge audience, enabling a much larger proportion of the population to hear songs performed by professional singers and music ensembles, including individuals from lower income groups who previously would not have been able to afford concert tickets. Radio broadcasting increased the ability of songwriters, singers and bandleaders to become nationally known. Another factor which helped to disseminate popular music was the introduction of \"talking pictures\"‚Äîsound films‚Äîin the late 1920s, which also included music and songs. In the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, there was a move towards consolidation in the recording industry, which led several major companies to dominate the record industry.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the new invention of television began to play an increasingly important role in disseminating new popular music. Variety shows regularly showcased popular singers and bands. In the 1960s, the development of new technologies in recording, such as multitrack recorders gave sound engineers and record producers an increasingly important role in popular music. By using multitrack recording techniques, sound engineers could create new sounds and sound effects that were not possible using traditional \"live\" recording techniques, such as singers performing their own backup vocals or having lead guitarists play rhythm guitars behind their guitar solo. During the 1960s era of psychedelic music, the recording studio was used to create even more unusual sounds, in order to mimic the effect of taking hallucinogenic drugs, some songs used tapes of instruments played backwards or panned the music from one side to the other of the stereo image.\n\nIn the 1970s, the trend towards consolidation in the recording industry continued to the point that the \"... dominance was in the hands of five huge transnational organizations, three American-owned (WEA, RCA, CBS) and two European-owned companies (EMI, Polygram)\". In the 1990s, the consolidation trend took a new turn: inter-media consolidation. This trend saw music recording companies being consolidated with film, television, magazines, and other media companies, an approach which facilitated cross-marketing promotion between subsidiaries. For example, a record company's singing star could be cross-promoted by the conglomerate's television talk shows and magazine arms.\n\nThe \"introduction of digital equipment (mixing desks, synthesizers, samplers, sequencers)\" in the 1990s resulted in what \"Grove Dictionary of Music\" dubbed the creation of \"new sound worlds\", as well as facilitating DIY music production by amateur musicians and \"tiny independent record labels\". In the 1990s, the availability of sound recording software and effects units software meant that an amateur indie band could record an album‚Äîwhich required a fully equipped recording studio in previous decades‚Äîusing little more than a laptop and a good quality microphone. That said, the audio quality of modern recording studios still outstrips what an amateur can produce.\n\nIn contrast to Western popular music, a genre of music that is popular outside of a Western nation, is categorized into World music. This label turns otherwise popular styles of music into an exotic and unknown category\".\" The Western concept of 'World Music' homogenizes many different genres of popular music under one accessible term for Western audiences. New media technology has led urban music styles to filter into distant rural areas across the globe. The rural areas, in turn, are able to give feedback to the urban centers about the new styles of music. Urbanization, modernization, exposure to foreign music and mass media have contributed to hybrid urban pop styles. The hybrid styles have also found a space within Western popular music through the expressions of their national culture. Recipient cultures borrow elements from host cultures and alter the meaning and context found in the host culture. Many Western styles, in turn, have become international styles through multinational recording studios.\n\nPopular African music styles have stemmed from traditional entertainment genres, rather than evolving from music used with certain traditional ceremonies like weddings, births, or funerals. African popular music as a whole has been influenced by European countries, African-American and Afro-Latin music, and region-specific styles that became popular across a wider range of people. Although due to the significance and strong position of culture in traditional African music, African popular music tends to stay within the roots of traditional African Popular Music. The genre of music, Maskanda, is popular in its culture of origin, South Africa. Although maskanda is a traditional music genre by definition, the people who listen to it influence the ideals that are brought forth in the music. A popular maskandi artist, Phuzekhemisi, had to lessen the political influence within his music to be ready for the public sphere. His music producer, West Nikosi, was looking for the commercial success in Phuzekhemisi's music rather than starting a political controversy.\n\nPolitical songs have been an important category of African popular music in many societies. During the continent's struggle against colonial rule, nationalistic songs boosted citizens' morale. These songs were based on Western marches and hymns reflecting the European education system that the early nationalistic leaders grew up in. Not all African political songs were based on Western styles. For example, in South Africa, the political songs during the Anti-Apartheid Movement were based on traditional tribal styles along with hybrid forms of imported genres. Activists used protest and freedom songs to persuade individuals to take action, become educated with the struggle, and empower others to be politically conscious. These songs reflected the nuances between the different classes involved in the liberation struggle.\n\nOne of the genres people of Africa use for political expression is Hip hop. Although hip hop in Africa is based on the North American template, it has been remade to produce new meanings for African young people. This allows the genre to be both locally and globally influential. African youth are shaped by the fast-growing genre's ability to communicate, educate, empower, and entertain. Artists who would have started in traditional music genres, like maskanda, became hip hop artists to provide a stronger career path for themselves. These rappers compare themselves to the traditional artists like the griot and oral storyteller, who both had a role in reflecting on the internal dynamics of the larger society. African hip hop creates youth culture, community intelligence, and global solidarity.\n\nPopular music in Indonesia can be categorized as hybrid forms of Western rock to genres that are originated in Indonesia and indigenous in style. The genre of music, Dangdut, is a genre of popular music specifically found in Indonesia. Dangdut formed two other styles of popular music, Indo-pop and Underground, together to create a new hybrid or fusion genre. The genre takes the noisy instrumentation from Underground, but still makes it easy to listen to like Indo-pop. Dangdut attempts to form many popular music genres like rock, pop, and traditional music to create this new sound that lines up with the consumers' tastes. This genre has formed into a larger social movement that includes clothing, youth culture, the resurgence of Islam, and the capitalist entertainment industry.\n\nAnother music scene that is popular in Indonesia is Punk rock. This genre was shaped in Indonesia by the local interpretations of the media from the larger global punk movement. Jeremy Wallach argues that while Green Day was seen as the \"death of punk,\" in Indonesia they were the catalyst for a larger punk movement. Punk in Indonesia calls on the English-speaking world to embrace the global sects of the punk culture and become open-minded to the transnational genre.\n\nIn a 2015 study involving young students in Shanghai, youths stated they enjoyed listening to both Chinese, other Asian nationalities, and Anglo-American popular music. There are three ways that young people of China were able to access global music. The first reason was a policy change since the late 1970s where the country was opened up to the rest of the world instead of being self-contained. This created more opportunities for Chinese people to interact with people outside of their country of origin to create a more globalized culture. The second reason is that the Chinese television and music industry since the 1980s has broadcast television shows from their neighboring Asian societies and the West. The third reason is the impact of the internet and smartphones on the accessibility of streaming music.\n\nIn 2015, students in China accounted for 30.2% of China's internet population and the third and fifth most popular uses of the internet were respectively, internet music and internet video use. The youths described being able to connect to the emotions and language of the Chinese music, but also enjoyed the melodies found within Anglo-American music. The students also believed that listening to the English music would improve their English language skills.\"\n\nModernization of music in the Arab world involved borrowing inspiration from Turkish music and Western musical styles. The late Egyptian singer, Umm Kulthum, stated,\"We must respect ourselves and our art. The Indians have set a good example for us - they show great respect for themselves and their arts. Wherever they are, they wear their native dress and their music is known throughout the world. This is the right way.\" She discussed this to explain why Egypt and the Arab world needed to take pride in the popular music styles originating in their culture so the styles were not lost in the modernization. Local musicians learned Western instrumental styles to create their own popular styles including their native languages and indigenous musical features. Communities in throughout the Arab world place high value on their indigenous musical identities while assimilating to new musical styles from neighboring countries or mass media. Through the 1980s and 1990s, popular music has been seen as a problem for the Iranian government because of the non-religious meanings within the music and the bodily movements of dancing or headbanging. During this time period, metal became a popular underground subculture through the Middle East. Just like their Western counterparts, Middle Eastern metal followers expressed their feelings of alienation. But their thoughts came from war and social restrictions on youth.\n\nIn interviews of Iranian teenagers between 1990 and 2004, the youth overall preferred Western popular music, even though it was banned by the government. Iranian underground rock bands are composed of members who are young, urban-minded, educated, relatively well-off, and global beings. Iranian rock is described by the traits that these band members possess. The youth who take part in underground music in the Middle East are aware of the social constraints of their countries, but they are not optimistic about social change. Iranian rock bands have taken up an internationalist position to express their rebellion from the discourses in their national governments.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2344968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344968", "title": "Renzo De Felice", "text": "Renzo De Felice\n\nRenzo De Felice (8 April 1929 ‚Äì 25 May 1996) was an Italian historian, who specialized in the Fascist era, writing, among other works, a 6000-page biography of Mussolini (4 volumes, 1965‚Äì1997). He argued that Mussolini was a revolutionary modernizer in domestic issues but a pragmatist in foreign policy who continued the Realpolitik policies of Italy from 1861 to 1922.\n\nDe Felice was born in Rieti and studied under Federico Chabod and Delio Cantimori at the Sapienza University of Rome. During his time as student, he was a member of the Italian Communist Party. After the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, De Felice was among 101 Italian intellectuals who sharply criticized the Italian Communists for backing of the Soviets.\n\nHe broke with them and joined the Italian Socialist Party. He taught history at the University of Rome. He was married to Livia De Ruggiero. He died in Rome.\n\nDe Felice is best known for a massive four volume, eight book biography of Benito Mussolini that was almost finished when he died. De Felice was the founder and editor of the influential journal \"Storia Contemporanea\". De Felice, a liberal Jew, also wrote a well-regarded history of Jewish life under the Fascist government and articles on Italian Jacobinism.\n\nDe Felice's leading interest was in Fascism. In his view, there were two types of Fascism, \"Fascism as a movement\" and \"Fascism as a regime\". De Felice saw Fascism, especially in the \"movement\" stage, as a revolutionary middle-class ideology that had deep roots in the Age of Enlightenment. Moreover, De Felice insisted that it was not caused by fear of a proletarian revolution on the part of the lower middle classes, as Leftist historiography maintained; it was rather an assertive movement, originated by an emerging middle class in search for its proper role.\n\nFascism, as a regime, was seen by De Felice as nothing more than Mussolini's policy, which tended to make of Fascist ideology just the superstructure of Mussolini's dictatorship and personal power. De Felice felt that fascism should be seen as valid political ideology, not just something to be demonized and dismissed in simplistic terms. He argued that studies on Fascism should get out from the political debate and become a historiographical issue based on scientific assertions.\n\nFurthermore, De Felice insisted that there was no connection or valid comparisons to be drawn between Italian Fascism and German national socialism, which De Felice saw as being a completely different political ideology. Critics on the Left attacked De Felice for being too sympathetic to Italian Fascism. Giuliano Procacci, Paolo Alatri, Nicola Tranfaglia and others even accused De Felice of supporting Fascism. However, Italian communist leader and intellectual activist Giorgio Amendola came to de Felice's defense, and rejected many of the criticisms of Tranfaglia and Ferrara in 1975, calling for more civil dialogue on fascism and antifascism. Although he acknowledged many of de Felice's discrepancies, Amendola endorsed some of De Felice's ideas, including the \"revolutionary aspect in Fascism\" and the theory that Mussolini's Fascist movement attracted ample adherents among the populace.\n\n\n"}

Koehl coined the term \"neofeudalism\" for the characterization of the national socialist rule, and completed an account of the history of the SS in 1983.\n\nRobert Lewis Koehl was born on 6 March 1922 in Chicago, Illinois. He studied in at Harvard University, where he was admitted as member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. In 1943, Koehl married Lieselotte Franziska Eisenhardt, who had emigrated from Nazi Germany in 1939, and the couple had three children.\n\nDuring the World War II he interrupted his studies for the war service, serving as surveyor and interpreter for the U.S. Army Intelligence in Nazi German-occupied Europe.\n\nBack in Harvard he acquired his Master of Arts in 1947 with the work \"A Prelude to the Third Reich\". In 1950, he earned his Doctor degree on Heinrich Himmler as Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood. He subsequently taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, at University of Nebraska in Lincoln and from 1964 until his retirement 1997 in the Department of Educational Policy Studies of University of Wisconsin-Madison in Madison, a department of which he was an early founder.\n\nKoehl's work focused on European history, especially the history of national socialism. His doctorate thesis, published in revised form in 1957, was mainly based on material of the RuSHA trial, and for a long time was one of few papers on the National Socialist Settlement and Population Policy in the German occupation of Poland.\n\nInspired by the feudalism concept, Koehl coined the term \"neofeudalism\" to describe national socialism. He wanted in particular to grasp the domination conditions in the German-occupied East, where German rule was personalized and local commanders had absolute power. This was an early attempt to understand the irrational aspects of national socialism. In pointing out the similarities between the charismatic elements of medieval and national socialist rule, Koehl opposed later attempts to conceive of national socialism as charismatic rule in the sense of Max Weber. However, recent research does not follow Koehl's assumption that the feudalist power relations originated from the atavistic ideology of national socialism.\n\nKoehl also referred back to the term \"Concentration Camp - SS\". He thus designated a group of SS members in the concentration camps, which were not seconded to battlefields of the Waffen-SS. According to , Koehl's concept of historical reality corresponds to a national socialist functioneer elite. For Koehl, SS perpetrators were \"social engineers\". In 1983 he presented a complete version of the SS.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4746042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4746042", "title": "Simonas Daukantas", "text": "Simonas Daukantas\n\nSimonas Daukantas (; 28 October 1793 ‚Äì 6 December 1864) was a Lithuanian/Samogitian historian, writer, and ethnographer. One of the pioneers of the Lithuanian National Revival, he is credited as the author of the first book on the history of Lithuania written in the Lithuanian language. Only a few of his works were published during his lifetime and he died in obscurity. However, his works were rediscovered during the later stages of the National Revival. His views reflected the three major trends of the 19th century: romanticism, nationalism, and liberalism.\n\nDaukantas was born in Samogitia to a Lithuanian family. Likely a son of free peasants, he later produced proof of his noble birth to get university degree and a promotion in his government job. He attended schools in Kretinga and ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ Kalvarija and was noted as an excellent student. Daukantas studied law at the University of Vilnius, though his interest lay in philology and history. After the graduation, he worked as a civil servant of the Russian Empire from 1825 to 1850. He first worked at the office of the Governor-General of Livonia, Estonia and Courland in Riga then moved to Saint Petersburg to work at the Governing Senate. At the Senate, he had the opportunity to study the Lithuanian Metrica, the state archive of the 14‚Äì18th century legal documents of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1850, Daukantas retired from his job due to poor health and moved back to Samogitia where he lived in Varniai under the care of bishop Motiejus Valanƒçius for a few years. He hoped to publish some of his works with bishop's help, but the bishop prioritized religious work and they began to quarrel. In 1855, Daukantas moved to in present-day Latvia and later to Papilƒó where he died in obscurity in 1864.\n\nWhile Daukantas knew seven languages, he published exclusively in Lithuanian. He was a prolific writer and worked on a wide range of books ‚Äì studies on the history of Lithuania, publications of primary historical sources, collections of Lithuanian folklore, Polish‚ÄìLithuanian dictionaries, Latin textbook for schoolchildren, primer of the Lithuanian language, Catholic prayer book, agricultural manuals for peasants, translations of classical Roman texts, novel for youth inspired by \"Robinson Crusoe\". However, only a few of these works were published during his lifetime. Of the four studies on history, he managed to publish only one, \"The Character of the Ancient Lithuanians, Highlanders, and Samogitians\", in 1845. While he was a well read erudite who spent considerable time and effort in obtaining primary sources, his historical works are highly influenced by romantic nationalism and didactically idealize the past. He used poetic descriptions, rhetorical elements, and emotional language that brought his history works closer to a literary work. His histories are valued not for their scientific content, but for their contribution to the development of the Lithuanian national identity. After the closing of Vilnius University in 1832, Lithuanians did not have a professionally trained historian until 1904 and used Daukantas' histories extensively. Daukantas identified language as the determining factor of nationality and articulated the nationalist anti-Polish sentiment that became the fundamental ideas of the Lithuanian National Revival and that survive in Lithuanian historiography into the 21st century. \n\nDaukantas was born on 28 October 1793 in near Lenkimai in Samogitia. He was the oldest of seven children (two sons and five daughters). With Daukantas' help, his brother Aleksandras later studied medicine at Vilnius University. Baptismal records of the two sons (but not of the daughters) specified that they were children of Lithuanian nobles. There was an academic debate whether this information was accurate or falsified to provide the sons with better opportunities in life, a common practice among wealthier peasants at the time. An analysis of inventories of Skuodas Manor revealed that the family were free peasants ‚Äì different from serfs in that they had some personal freedoms and paid quit-rent instead of performing corv√©e. When the manor was confiscated from the Sapiehas for their participation in the Uprising of 1831, the family was turned into serfs. However, Eimantas Meilus argued that inventories alone do not prove that the family was not of noble origin as many poorer nobles were equated to peasants and paid quit-rent to wealthier manors. The family worked about 1.5 voloks of land and pasture and raised cash for quit-rent by selling flax in Riga or LiepƒÅja. According to the epitaph engraved on the gravestone of Daukantas' mother, she and her husband participated in a battle near LiepƒÅja during the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising against the partitions of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. In 1799‚Äì1800, his father was mentioned as manor's forester.\n\nDaukantas' education was financed by his uncle, priest Simonas Lopacinskis (died in 1814). Daukantas attended a two-year primary school in Kretinga. When the school was visited by an inspector from Vilnius University in 1808, Daukantas was listed among 16 exemplary second-year students (out of total 68 students). The school curriculum included lessons on Polish and Latin grammar, geography, arithmetic, religion and morality. At some point, Daukantas enrolled into a four-grade six-year (the last two grades took two years to finish) school in ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ Kalvarija. Another inspector listed him as one of four best students in the last fourth grade in 1814. The school curriculum was dictated by Vilnius University and included natural law (textbook by ), classical antiquity, rhetoric, geography, geometry, algebra, physics, natural sciences (textbook by Stanis≈Çaw Bonifacy Jundzi≈Ç≈Ç), gardening. However, since all teachers were Dominican monks, students had to attend daily masses and go to confession every month. The subjects were taught in Polish and the use of Samogitian (Lithuanian), even among students, was prohibited in November 1806. The official rationale was to facilitate the learning of Polish. However, as later attested by Motiejus Valanƒçius, neither students nor teachers knew Polish well and Daukantas never learned proper Polish pronunciation.\n\nIn 1814, Daukantas with 10 rubles in his pocket and a bag of clothes on his back traveled on foot from Samogitia to Vilnius to attend . The school year started on 1 September, but Daukantas was registered only on 26 September as a fifth-year student. That school year, the school had 423 students, mostly sons of nobles and officials. The gymnasium, together with Vilnius in general, was recovering after the French invasion of Russia in 1812. Its original premises were occupied by a war hospital and so it temporarily shared rooms with Vilnius University. In June‚ÄìJuly 1815, the gymnasium organized an annual public examination of its students attended by members of the clergy and university professors. Daukantas was listed among 14 students who distinguished themselves during this event. He successfully graduated from the gymnasium in early summer 1816.\n\nIn fall 1816, Daukantas began studies at the Faculty of Literature and Liberal Arts at Vilnius University, then known as the Imperial University of Vilna. Adam Mickiewicz transferred to the faculty at the same time. Daukantas was interested in philology and studied Latin, Russian, and Polish literature, French language, rhetoric, poetry, natural and land law (leges patrias). His professors included of classical philology and of poetry and rhetoric. In 1817, Daukantas applied for a Candidate of Philosophy degree, but was rejected because he did not provide required certificates and did not complete a thesis. After another year of studies, Daukantas transferred to the Faculty of Moral and Political Sciences in fall 1818. These studies could secure a more promising career as a judge or a government official. He attended lectures of , who formed Daukantas as a historian. Onacewicz studied at the University of K√∂nigsberg and had access to the archives of the Teutonic Order and spent a year studying archives at the estate of Nikolay Rumyantsev in Gomel. He collected enough information to establish a course on the history of Lithuania as a separate subject from the history of Poland. Another key professor was who taught law and studied Lithuanian Statutes, Casimir's Code, Lithuanian Chronicles.\nOn 12 July 1819, Daukantas was granted the Candidate of Law degree in canon and Roman law. To get the diploma, Daukantas needed to provide proof of his noble status. He provided a large parchment, signed by Micha≈Ç J√≥zef R√∂mer as marshal of the szlachta of the Vilna Governorate on 24 August 1820, that described an extensive genealogy of Daukantai family of that traced back to late 1500s. While the document is authentic, historian Vytautas Merkys concluded that Daukantas altered the genealogy to attach his own family to the noble Daukantai family, another known practice among peasants that shared surnames with noble families. Daukantas received his diploma on 25 January 1821.\n\nHe continued his studies and took canon law, Roman civil law, criminal law, land law, political economy, history, logic and metaphysics. From fall 1820, Daukantas stopped attending lectures except for land law. He stopped taking classes in spring 1822. In all classes he received \"good\" or \"very good\" evaluations except in logic and metaphysics taught by Anio≈Ç Dowgird where his knowledge was rated as \"satisfactory\". In spring 1821, Daukantas submitted an application for a master's degree. The oral exams took place in October‚ÄìNovember 1821. He had to answer questions on a wide variety of subjects, from the law and history of Ancient Rome and impostors of Dmitry of Uglich to theory of taxes and specifics of Russian economy as well as thoughts of Montesquieu and Adam Smith. In July 1822, Daukantas defended his thesis on the power of the head of a family according to the natural, Roman, and land law. He was granted the master's degree in canon and Roman law on 15 July 1822. \n\nHowever, Daukantas had to wait until 1825 to get his diploma. The degree needed a confirmation by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education. The university prepared the papers in August 1822, but they were returned because they needed translation into Russian. The translated documents were not sent out until March 1824. Part of the delay was caused by suppression of the Filomat and Filaret secret student societies (Daukantas' name was included on a list of potential members, but there is no evidence that he ever joined them). Discovered in May 1823, members of these societies were tried and sentenced for anti-Tsarist activities. Until resolution of the trials, students were prohibited from leaving Vilnius and the university ceased issuing graduation certificates. The process was delayed again due to the replacement of Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, curator of the , with Nikolay Novosiltsev. The papers had to be reviewed by the new curator who approved Daukantas' degree in February 1825 followed by the ministry's approval in March. Finally, the university issued the diploma on 30 April 1825.\n\nThere is no reliable information on Daukantas' activities while he waited for his diploma. Earlier biographers claimed that he studied at the University of Dorpat, but researchers Vaclovas Bir≈æi≈°ka and found no record of Daukantas among Dorpat students. claimed that Daukantas visited France, Germany, England, while other authors claimed that he studied historical documents at the K√∂nigsberg archives, but there is no record that he was issued a passport that would have allowed him to leave Vilnius. Daukantas likely joined a small circle of Samogitian students that promised to promote Lithuanian language and culture signifying the early stages of the Lithuanian National Revival. There a popular legend that he went to the Gate of Dawn and promised to write only in Lithuanian. Already in 1822, he wrote \"Darbai sen≈≥j≈≥ lietuvi≈≥ ir ≈æemaiƒçi≈≥\" (Deeds of the Ancient Lithuanians and Samogitians), a 855-page manuscript on the history of Lithuania. While it was not published until 1929, two copies of the manuscript are known. Researcher Roma Bonƒçkutƒó proposed that Daukantas was inspired to write the work after reading \"The Seasons\" by Kristijonas Donelaitis, first published by Ludwig Rhesa in 1818. In 1824, Daukantas translated 111 fables of Phaedrus, but they remained unpublished until 1846.\n\nWith his master's diploma in hand, Daukantas searched for a position in a government office. In September 1825, he was issued a passport that allowed him to travel to the Governorates of Livonia and Saint Petersburg. He found a post at the office of the Governor-General of Livonia, Estonia and Courland in Riga. All government officials in the Russian Empire were divided into 14 categories, from imperial ministers to train conductors (see: Table of Ranks). In 1826, Daukantas was recognized as a titular councillor, 9th category official. For a promotion to collegiate assessor he needed to prove his noble status and have three years of experience. In February 1826, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia ordered to prepare a new law that would require all nobles to prove their social status. While the law was adopted only in May 1834, it became a lot more difficult to prove one's noble birth. Daukantas and his brother Aleksandras, then a student at Vilnius University, had to resubmit all documents proving their genealogy to a special commission of Vilna Governorate. The commission recognized both brothers as nobles and forwarded documents to under the Governing Senate in January 1832. In May 1833, Heroldia recognized Daukantas as noble, but not his brother. Daukantas was promoted to the 8th category in April 1834. \nDuring the Uprising of 1831, Daukantas was in Riga ‚Äì he was not granted vacations between December 1829 and July 1834. In 1833, he received two awards of 75 and 110 rubles for excellent work. We was interested in the history of Lithuania, but could not get access to the archives of Riga magistrate. After the promotion, he decided to change his position and move to Saint Petersburg. He applied for a job at the first (administrative) department of the Governing Senate. After a background check to ensure that he did not participate in the uprising, Daukantas started his new job in March 1835. He worked on paperwork related to ports and Russian Imperial Navy. In March 1837, he transferred to the third department which dealt with all kinds of cases, complaints, and appeals from eastern governorates of the Russian Empire, including Vilna and Kovno. Daukantas was attracted to this position because the office used Lithuanian Metrica, a collection of the 14‚Äì18th century legal documents of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He became an assistant of Franciszek Malewski. His annual salary was 286 rubles with additional 57 rubles for food. It was a small pay and Daukantas earned additional money by helping various people to locate needed genealogical and other documents in the Metrica. In July 1839, Daukantas received an award equal to his annual pay for helping create a practical index of the Metrica. However, he did not receive either Order of Saint Anna (2nd class) or the Order of Saint Stanislaus (2nd class) which were generally awarded after 12 and 15 years of employment.\n\nIn February 1841, Daukantas' brother Aleksandras was implicated in an anti-Tsarist organization established by Szymon Konarski. After an interrogation, he attempted suicide and was brought to a hospital in Kherson. He died in the hospital on 5 October 1841. More repressions and restrictions, including stricter censorship, followed after the Revolutions of 1848. Afraid of attracting police attention and losing his job, Daukantas kept his historical research a secret and always asked friends and acquaintances not to publish or mention his name. He used numerous non-repeating pen names and a few times published works without any name, though some researchers suggested that he also did that to create an impression that there were many Lithuanian writers. Even when sending a copy of \"B≈´das senovƒós lietuvi≈≥, kalnƒón≈≥ ir ≈æemaiƒçi≈≥\" to Teodor Narbutt, Daukantas described the work as if written by an unknown person. \n\nIn Saint Petersburg, Daukantas worked on his studies on the history of Lithuania and was close friends with his former professor and who both lived in an apartment provided by the Rumyantsev Museum. They both died in February 1845 and Daukantas deeply mourned his friends. When Vilnius Theological Academy was moved to Saint Petersburg in 1842, it brought more Lithuanian intellectuals to Saint Petersburg. Daukantas is often crediting for inspiring Motiejus Valanƒçius, future Bishop of Samogitia, to write his works in Lithuanian. The small Samogitian circle was ruined when and Valanƒçius returned to Lithuania in 1844‚Äì1845. However, Daukantas and Valanƒçius continued to correspond and collaborate. It is likely that Valanƒçius wrote his fundamental work on the history of the Diocese of Samogitia in Lithuanian and not in Polish because of Daukantas' influence. In this work, Valanƒçius cited Daukantas' manuscript of \"Istorija ≈æemaiti≈°ka\" four times and Lithuanian Metrica (copies of which he could have obtained only from Daukantas) another four times, though likely used Daukantas and his sources more frequently as Valanƒçius mentioned a total of 19 Samogitian cities and towns that had received royal privileges.\n\nTeodor Narbutt, author of the nine-volume \"History of Lithuania\", began corresponding with Daukantas in March 1842. They exchanged books and materials. In total, Narbutt wrote 19 letters to Daukantas, and Daukantas wrote 20 letters to Narbutt. Their main concern was to obtain and publish historical documents and other primary sources related to the history of Lithuania. Daukantas was particularly wary of falsified or altered sources being published by various Polish historians. Their plan to publish primary sources was an intentional and principled decision to publish Lithuanian documents separately from Polish historians who began publishing \"Sources for the History of Poland\" (\"≈πr√≥d≈Ça do dziej√≥w Polski\"). Daukantas sent to Narbutt about 800 copies of various documents made during the years by himself or by Onacewicz, including a copy of \"Die Littauischen Wegeberichte\". In particular, he highly valued a copy of a manuscript by Albert Wijuk Koja≈Çowicz that cataloged and described various coat of arms of Lithuanian nobility. When Narbutt promised to find a way to publish the manuscript, Daukantas lent him the copy for a few months with strict orders to supervise the publication so that no Polish publishers could make any changes or alterations to the original text. Narbutt harbored plans to publish the Bychowiec Chronicle as the first volume of a series of primary source publications, but Daukantas lost his patience after receiving only promises of ever grander plans. Their collaboration broke down in 1844. Narbutt never published or returned the documents received from Daukantas who was angry over losing most valuable pieces of his collection and continued to demand their return until 1858. After Narbutt's death, his sons gifted some of the primary sources collected by their father, including 158 pages copied by Daukantas, to a library in Lviv (present-day Stefanyk National Science Library).\n\nIn a 1846 letter to Narbutt, Daukantas complained of poor health which he attributed to long hours spent in cold and damp archives of the Russian Senate. He complained that he had difficulty walking, but dismissed doctors' diagnosis of podagra. In summer 1850 he requested a three-month vacation to improve his health In September, he obtained an official certificate from a German doctor in Tel≈°iai that at the age of 58 and troubled by many ailments he was unfit to continue his work in Saint Petersburg. Daukantas was officially retired in February 1851 and allotted an annual pension of 42.90 silver rubles, but it was not enough to live on and he needed further financial support. His move to Lithuania coincided with the consecration of his old friend Motiejus Valanƒçius as Bishop of Samogitia in March 1850. Daukantas lived in Varniai where Valnƒçius resided and which was becoming a cultural center in Samogitia. He received a salary of 200 rubles from Valanƒçius and worked on his historical studies that he hoped to publish with Valanƒçius' help. However, soon the relationship soured perhaps because Valanƒçius prioritized religious work and literature and would assign tasks which had little to do with Lithuanian cultural work that Daukantas desired. Also, Valanƒçius had a more critical approach to writing history and reportedly criticized Daukantas' overly idealized work and carefully controlled the language of Daukantas' historical works.\n\nIn summer 1855, Daukantas moved from Varniai. Historians usually cite the conflict between Daukantas and Valanƒçius as the reason for the move, but ill health and fear of police persecution probably also contributed. Due to the Crimean War, Russian police became more vigilant and they came across \"B≈´das senovƒós lietuvi≈≥, kalnƒón≈≥ ir ≈æemaiƒçi≈≥\" that Daukantas had published in 1845. The censors reevaluated the book and deemed it inappropriate due to its anti-serfdom rhetoric. The police tracked down Daukantas and knew that he moved from Varniai to Courland. However, the book was already sold out and the investigation concluded with an order to keep an eye on bookstores in case a new edition of the book appeared. The book was one of the first books added to a list of prohibited books compiled in October 1855.\nDaukantas moved to () in present-day Latvia to live with Petras Smugleviƒçius, a medical doctor and a relative of painter Franciszek Smuglewicz. Smugleviƒçius was accused of belonging to a secret student society, arrested for a year, later acquitted, but still lived under police supervision. He was very supportive of Lithuanian cultural activities. In early 1858, Mikalojus Akelaitis also moved in to live with Smugleviƒçius. Akelaitis treated Daukantas as a fatherly figure and they supported each other's work. Daukantas continued to work on his historical studies, writing to linguist in hopes of obtaining books by Ludwig Rhesa and Daniel Klein and copies of historical sources from Johannes Voigt. He compiled a collection of historical documents, privileges from 1387‚Äì1561 that he had inherited from , and made one last attempt to collect the document he loaned to Teodor Narbutt. Daukantas supported the establishment of the and corresponded with Eustachy Tyszkiewicz hoping to transfer some of his collected historical documents to the museum. Akelaitis, Valanƒçius, and Daukantas wanted to establish \"Pakeleivingas\", a Lithuanian-language periodical aimed at the ordinary village people, but could not government's permission. Daukantas had four manuscripts ready to be published (two booklets with agricultural advice, Lithuanian reworking of \"Robinson Crusoe\", and a second edition of a Lithuanian primer), but they all remained unpublished due to lack of funds.\n\nAround summer 1859, Daukantas left Jaunsvirlauka and briefly lived with various friends and relatives. In October 1861, he moved to Papilƒó to live with Ignotas Vai≈°vila, a parish priest. His health continued to deteriorate. Daukantas and Valanƒçius exchanged final bitter letters in 1861, completely severing their friendship. One of these letters was later published in \"Au≈°ra\". It is unclear what Daukantas did during the January Uprising of 1863‚Äì1864, but several of his friends were arrested, imprisoned, or exiled to Siberia. Vai≈°vila was arrested, but released. Daukantas died on 6 December 1864 and was buried on the summit of the Papilƒó hill fort without much ceremony. Vai≈°vila put a simple engraved stone on the grave; twenty years later, he replaced it with an engraved ledger gravestone commissioned in Riga which survives to this day. In 1925, Antanas Raudonis, a former Lithuanian book smuggler and an amateur sculptor, added a cross that is shaped as an oak stump with a growing shoot.\n\nDaukantas wrote four original books on the history of Lithuania. Only one of them was published during his lifetime. In his research, Daukantas was hindered by inaccessibility of sources, lack of funds, absent institutional support (i.e. no government institution or university to assist him). It was a lonely, costly, and frustrating undertaking. Book publishing was an expensive undertaking. For example, Daukantas had to pay 2,000 silver rubles to the publisher of his 120-page Latin grammar. The only person known to have provided financial assistance to Daukantas is Ksaveras Kanapackis, who is listed as sponsor of ten books by Daukantas.\n\nHe wrote his first historical work, \"Darbai sen≈≥j≈≥ lietuvi≈≥ ir ≈æemaiƒçi≈≥\" (Deeds of the Ancient Lithuanians and Samogitians), in 1822 while still a student at Vilnius University. The work starts with the 7th century BC and ends with the death of King Jogaila (W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço) in 1434. The work was discovered in 1919 and first published in 1929. The work was dedicated not to historians or learned men, but to Lithuanian mothers who taught their children and told them deeds of their ancestors. Thus he recognized and acknowledged women's role in educating the younger generation.\n\nHis second and largest historical work, \"Istorija ≈æemaiti≈°ka\" (Samogitian History), was completed by 1838. The manuscript had 1,106 pages. It appears that Daukantas hoped to publish it around 1848 as he ordered a clean copy, which was discovered in 1983. The work ended with the death of Sigismund II Augustus in 1572. \"Istorija ≈æemaiti≈°ka\" under the title \"Lietuvos istorija\" (History of Lithuania) was published in two volumes in 1893 and 1897 in the United States. In 1850, Daukantas reworked it as \"Pasakojimas apie veikalus lietuvi≈≥ tautos senovƒóje\" (Story of the Deeds of the Ancient Lithuanians) which ended with the death of Grand Duke Vytautas in 1430. He hoped to publish it with the help of Motiejus Valanƒçius and two copies with various corrections were produced. In 1882, made another copy with hopes of publishing it, but the first 96 pages up to year 1201 were printed by at the press of Martynas Jankus in 1893 and the work was first published in full only in 1976. It was the only manuscript that Daukantas signed in his real name (though he also used pen name Jonas Einoras).\n\nHis third historical book was \"B≈´das senovƒós lietuvi≈≥, kalnƒón≈≥ ir ≈æemaiƒçi≈≥\" (The Character of the Ancient Lithuanians, Highlanders, and Samogitians). He created the word \"kalnƒónai\" (highlanders) to refer to Auk≈°taitija. Russian censors considered the manuscript in May 1844, but due to difficulties finding censors who knew Lithuanian, the work approved only in March 1845. The book was published in Saint Petersburg in February 1846. It was republished in the United States in 1892 and in Lithuania in 1935. It was the first history of the culture of Lithuania. Excerpts were translated to Polish in \"Rocznik Literacki\" in 1850 and to German in \"Mitteilungen der Litauischen literarischen Gesellschaft\" in 1885. The content was arranged not chronologically as in other works but thematically with chapters covering subjects such as religion, customs, commerce, geography. The short chapter on numismatics, which discussed the Lithuanian long currency and earliest coins of the Grand Duchy, retained its scientific relevance until 1930s. The book described material and spiritual life of Lithuanians in poetic, literary language. Excerpts of this work are often included in reading materials for Lithuanian literature lessons in Lithuanian schools.\n\nDaukantas was one of the first to clearly distinguish a nation from a state. He believed that a nation is defined by its language and customs, not statehood. His histories were not about a territory that no longer existed (and that was mourned by Adam Mickiewicz), but about the living nation. As long as Lithuanian language and customs (folklore, songs, tales, proverbs) existed, the Lithuanian nation would also survive. Daukanatas proposed than developing culture and pursuing education, not just military or political means, were forms of resistance. Therefore, he associated the Lithuanian national identity not with the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, but with the Lithuanian language, folk culture, and customs ‚Äì an idea that was further pursued by the Lithuanian National Revival and led to the formation of the independent Lithuania in 1918. He further held liberal ideas that people were born with inalienable rights and that there was a social contract between a nation and the state. He thought that peasants and other commoners were the core of a nation thus going against the Polish trend to emphasize the nation of nobles. \n\nHis primary goal was to inspire love of the homeland and Lithuanian national pride among the common folk. He used poetic and lively descriptions, rhetorical elements, monologues and dialogues, and emotional language that brought his history works closer to a literary work. Particularly artistic are wild forest and battle scenes. Daukantas painted an idealized image of ancient Lithuanians who embodied stoic values and lived peacefully in their vast forests until the nobility adopted foreign customs, became lazy, and started exploiting the common folk. This depiction echoed ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Gottfried Herder that the savage, unspoiled by the civilization, was inherently noble and good. He depicted Grand Duke Vytautas as the great Lithuanian hero while King Jogaila, who initiated the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union in 1385, was a symbol of all ills and evils that later befell Lithuania. He blamed Poland and Polish nobility for Lithuania losing its statehood, moral enslavement of Lithuanians, and falsification and distortions of Lithuania's history. Poland brought economic decline and moral decay to Lithuania ‚Äì the opposite of the common Polish claim that they \"civilized\" the pagan barbarians. Such strong anti-Polish sentiment was a radical and daring development among Lithuanians at the time when Polish intellectuals considered the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union to be sacred, but it paved the way for separating the dual Polish-Lithuanian identity into the modern Polish and Lithuanian national identities. Daukantas identified language as the determining factor of nationality. After the publication of \"Au≈°ra\" in 1883, such anti-Polish attitudes became increasingly common among Lithuanian activists. \n\nDaukantas idealized and idolized the past. Virgil Krapauskas asserted that Daukantas' letters to Narbutt showed Daukantas to be a better scholar than his works ‚Äì in the letters Daukantas emphasized the need for better methods of collecting, publishing and analyzing primary sources, though his works remained highly romantic and didactic. Daukantas spent considerable effort in tracking down various historical documents, but he believed that where historical records are missing, historians should use their imagination to fill in the gaps. If a source was favorable to Lithuania, he did not evaluate it critically and readily accepted a number of legends. For example, he elaborated on the theory that Lithuanians were descendants of Herules that he took from Albert Wijuk Koja≈Çowicz (though he rejected the legend about Roman Palemonids), praised ancient democracy of Prussian king Widewuto, and used a loose translation of the short story \"≈ªiwila\" by Adam Mickiewicz. But he was critical of sources that portrayed Lithuania in a negative light. For example, he was one of the first to criticize the Teutonic account of the Battle of Strƒóva as a crushing defeat of Lithuanian forces or argue that the Lithuanian returned to the Battle of Grunwald and continued to fight. While Daukantas' scholarship was poor and does not stand up to modern standards, it was on par with his contemporaries.\n\nOverall, Daukantas' historical works were mostly influenced by the two-volume \"Historiae Lituanae\" by Albert Wijuk Koja≈Çowicz (published in 1650 and 1669) from which he borrowed the structure, content, rhetorical and stylistic elements. He also borrowed poetic elements from Kristijonas Donelaitis Daukantas cited his sources erratically and inconsistently. \"Darbai sen≈≥j≈≥ lietuvi≈≥ ir ≈æemaiƒçi≈≥\" had 254 references: 89 to works by August von Kotzebue, 62 to Albert Wijuk Koja≈Çowicz, 29 to Nikolay Karamzin, 15 to , and 10 to Teodor Narbutt, in total 31 authors. \"Istorija ≈æemaiti≈°ka\" cited 320 references; the number of different authors grew to about 70, mostly German historians. There was a shift in references used: von Kotzebue (18 references) fell out of favor and was replaced by Johannes Voigt (75 references) while Hlebowicz was not cited at all. At times, he went beyond citing sources and outright plagiarized works by Koja≈Çowicz, Kotzebue, Voigt. Daukantas also added a number of citations to primary sources, including the Lithuanian Chronicles, Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, chronicles by Wigand of Marburg, Peter von Dusburg, Lucas David. Towards the end of the manuscript, the citations became scarcer and rarer. There were only five references, including two to Jan ≈Åasicki, for 227 pages covering the period from 1440 to 1572.\n\nIn \"B≈´das senovƒós lietuvi≈≥, kalnƒón≈≥ ir ≈æemaiƒçi≈≥\", Daukantas cited a few documents from the Lithuanian Metrica, but perhaps was afraid to cite it more often as it could have attracted unwanted attention from the Tsarist authorities that he was using his access to the Metrica for non-work related purposes (the Metrica was carefully guarded to avoid any alterations or falsifications). In this work, Daukantas expanded his bibliography by adding references to \"De moribus tartarorum, lituanorum et moscorum\", Livonian Chronicle of Henry, works by Alexander Guagnini and Jan ≈Åasicki, and others. He also used Lithuanian folklore, etymologies, and semantics as a source. While Daukantas cited a wide range of works and authors, including some classical historians such as Tacitus or Ptolemy, he avoided citing Polish historians who supported the union between Poland and Lithuania and considered Lithuania to be just a region of Poland. In particular, he disliked and barely cited Jan D≈Çugosz. Overall, Daukantas was an erudite and well-read person, familiar with both classical and new western sources. He knew seven languages: Lithuanian, Russian, Polish, Latin, German, Latvian, and French.\n\nIn addition to the brief Latin‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary published in 1838, Daukantas compiled three other dictionaries, but they were not published. Lithuanians still used the Polish‚ÄìLatin‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary by Konstantinas Sirvydas first published in 1620. Therefore, Daukantas was not the only Lithuanian to start a new Polish‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary. Mikalojus Akelaitis, Laurynas Ivinskis, Dionizas Po≈°ka, Simonas Staneviƒçius, Kiprijonas Nezabitauskis, and others are known to have started compiling a dictionary but their works were similarly not published. Daukantas' entries did not provide lexicographic information (for example, gender of nouns) and had very few illustrative examples of how a certain word is used in a sentence. These lexicographic weaknesses reveal Daukantas' tendency to focus solely on words at the price of grammar, syntax, or style. He wanted to demonstrate that Lithuanian language is rich in words and is an equal of other languages, but neglected practical aspects of the dictionaries.\n\nSometime in 1838‚Äì1846, Daukantas worked on a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary that possibly contained about 23,000 words. Only a fragment with 2,244 words has been preserved. The Polish list of words was borrowed from a dictionary published by Jan Litwi≈Ñski in 1815. Around 1842‚Äì1850, he worked on compiling a Lithuanian‚ÄìLatin dictionary. The unfinished work contains 3,977 words and stops at the word \"Gwƒ©ld√≥s\". Around 1850‚Äì1855, Daukantas compiled a three-volume 2,280-page Polish‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary. It is unfinished and, according to the count by Jonas Kruopas, contains 56,567 Polish words but only 37,677 Lithuanian equivalents. For the base list of Polish words, Daukantas used the Polish‚ÄìFrench dictionary by published in 1847. The manuscript of the last dictionary was transferred by Daukantas' relatives to the Lithuanian Scientific Society in 1911. There it was studied by Kazimieras B≈´ga who picked out Lithuanian words, sometimes not known from anywhere else, for his planned Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian. The three volumes of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary were first published in 1993‚Äì1996. \n\nFrom his own experience, Daukantas understood that Lithuanian students struggled learning Latin because they had to use Polish textbooks and many Lithuanians did not speak Polish before entering school. Therefore, in 1837, he published a 120-page grammar book on Latin. It started with a basic introduction to the Lithuanian grammar on which then Latin grammar rules were built on. Thus, at the same time, it was one of the first textbooks of Lithuanian grammar. In 1838, Daukantas published \"Epitome historiae sacrae\" by the French author Charles Fran√ßois Lhomond and added a 42-page Latin‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary with about 2,350 Latin words and 250 word combinations and 3,880 Lithuanian words and 260 word combinations. The book was meant as a supplemental Latin reading for school students. It was a popular work that was frequently published with a dictionary. Daukantas did not compile the Latin list of words, but translated it from a Polish edition.\n\nIn 1841, Tsarist authorities, looking to weaken the Polish culture, allowed Samogitian Diocese to establish parish schools that could teach Lithuanian language. In 1842, Daukantas published 1,500 copies of \"Abƒócƒólƒó lietuvi≈≥, kalnƒón≈≥ ir ≈æemaiƒçi≈≥ kalbos\" (Alphabet of Lithuanian, Highlander, and Samogitian Language). The primer included 18 pages dedicated to Russian language and sample reading material that was not religious. While the book included the traditional prayers and catechism, it also added short moral teachings (e.g. to respect your parents), seven fables, and 298 Lithuanian proverbs. Some of these proverbs were rather crude and vulgar and had to be manually scratched out. However, it was not popular. In a letter to Motiejus Valanƒçius, Daukantas bitterly complained that less than 400 copies were sold in two years. In 1849, Daukantas prepared a second edition of the primer that removed the non-religious texts, but the manuscript remained unclaimed at the censor's office. Another edition was prepared in 1862 which returned the original text except for a few vulgar proverbs, but it could not be published due to the Lithuanian press ban.\n\nDaukantas prepared five other books for school students, but only two were published during his lifetime. He published a translation of fables by Phaedrus (he had them first translated in 1824) and a translation of biographies from \"De viris illustribus\" by Cornelius Nepos, both in 1846. He published the fables with hopes of awakening an interest in Lithuanian folk tales. He twice translated and reworked \"Robinson der J√ºngere\" by Joachim Heinrich Campe (inspired by \"Robinson Crusoe\") ‚Äì first in 1846 as 397-page \"Rubinaiƒçio Peli≈´zƒós gyvenimas\" (The Life of Rubinaitis Peli≈´≈æƒó; first published in 1984) and then in 1855 as 495-page \"Palangos Petris\" (Petris of Palanga; manuscript lost). He adapted the text by changing names to Lithuanian names, geographic names to locations in Lithuania, aboriginal gods to pagan Lithuanian gods, and borrowing historical details from the Couronian colonization of the Americas, but otherwise remained faithful to Campe's text. He also translated a work by the Roman historian Justin.\n\nDaukantas was passionate about the Lithuanian language and its purity. He was concerned that religious books, by far the most popular Lithuanian books at the time, were often translated by foreigners with poor knowledge of Lithuanian. As such, prayer book language was full of loanwords and barbarisms from various Slavic languages. Therefore, in 1843, he undertook to prepare a prayer book ‚Äì a rare feat for a layperson ‚Äì in correct Lithuanian. He took prayers from various popular books of the time and submitted his manuscript to bishop . The manuscript received the approval from the diocese only in 1847, but for some unknown reason was not published.\n\nDaukantas was the first to collect examples of all genres (songs, proverbs, fairy-tales, etc.) of Lithuanian folklore. He added Lithuanian proverbs to several of his works, but earlier works used proverbs already published by other authors. In total, he had prepared 932 proverbs for publication. Around 1834‚Äì1835, Daukantas started one of the first collections of Lithuanian fairy tales, fables, humorous stories. The handwritten collection was discovered by Jonas Jablonskis and published in full in 1932. Daukantas more frequently collected Lithuanian folk songs ‚Äì about 850 songs collected by Daukantas are preserved, mostly at the Martynas Ma≈ævydas National Library of Lithuania. In 1846, he published a collection of 118 songs and 190 proverbs. Daukantas edited the songs freely, sometimes merging two songs together. It was a popular book, only a few copies survive in Lithuanian libraries and all those those show heavy use. About 70 of these songs were republished by Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann in 1853 and six by August Schleicher in 1857. Daukantas worked perhaps on three more volumes, but they remained unpublished. Since Daukantas spent most of his time outside of Lithuania, he had to rely on local helpers (members of the intelligentsia or students) to visit the common villagers, write down samples of folklore, and send them to Daukantas. This way, the songs were collected by about 40 different people. His collection of folklore was published in two volumes in 1983‚Äì1984.\n\nIn 1847, Daukantas began translating and publishing booklets with agricultural advice in hopes that Lithuanian peasants could improve their economic conditions via more efficient and profitable farming methods. They were the first practical steps towards the idea that economic development would lead to the development of the national consciousness. He published works on tobacco and on hops in 1847. Next year, he re-published a book on beekeeping ‚Äì it was already published in Lithuanian in 1801 and 1820. In 1849, Daukantas published three booklets ‚Äì on fruit trees by , on tree seeds, and on fire prevention (it was first published in Lithuanian in 1802). The last book on fodder grasses was published in 1854. Daukantas had two more texts translated from Russian and Polish, but they were not published. Daukantas added original introductions to these texts where he often returned to history. For example, the books about tree seeds and beekeeping talked about the ancient forests of Lithuania.\n\nDaukantas was passionate about the purity of the Lithuanian language. To him it was the primary proof of the language's worth and importance at the time when it was marginalized and pushed out out of the public life by Polish and Russian. Language's practical use (ease of understanding, clear meaning, convenience) was of little importance. In the early works, Daukantas wrote in the heavy Samogitian dialect (dounininkai sub-dialect) using plentiful diacritics and archaic words, some even borrowed from Latvian or Prussian. Even his contemporaries, including fellow Samogitians Motiejus Valanƒçius and Kajetonas Nezabitauskis, complained that they had difficulty understanding the language. After 1845, when he started publishing popular booklets with agricultural advice, his language became less heavy, more similar to the Auk≈°taitian dialect. His orthography is extremely varied and inconsistent, even in the same manuscript, as he experimented wanting to eliminate features of Polish and to include features of Prussian Lithuania orthography.\n\nDaukantas had to create numerous neologisms. The three volume Polish‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary contained about 3,800 neologisms. As one of the first to write a grammar in Lithuanian, he had to create a number of grammatical terms. Of the many neologism, a few became widely accepted and used in the modern standard Lithuanian, including \"laikrodis\" (clock), \"prekyba\" (trade), \"vaistininkas\" (pharmacist), \"vietovƒó\" (location), \"b≈´dvardis\" (adjective), while many other were rejected, including \"au≈°rƒónai\" (Balts), \"laikoskaitlis\" (chronology), \"r≈´darbis\" (tailor). He did not consider Latvian to be a foreign language and often borrowed its words, for example \"asinas\" from Latvian \"asins\" for blood, \"mui≈æƒó\" from Latvian \"mui≈æa\" for manor. One of such borrowed words, \"valstybƒó\" for state or polity, became a standard Lithuanian word. Daukantas was an amateur linguist and frequently offered etymologies that were based on similar sounding words instead of the scientific comparative method.\n\nWhile Daukantas died in obscurity and most of his works unpublished, growing Lithuanian National Revival celebrated his patriotism. Already in the first issue of \"Au≈°ra\", the first Lithuanian-language newspaper, Jonas ≈†li≈´pas started publishing multi-part biography of Daukantas and raised the idea of publishing his works. Two historical studies by Daukantas were first published in \"Vienybƒó lietuvnink≈≥\" and later in separate books by Lithuanian Americans in 1890s. Daukantas' life and work were studied by , who presented a paper to the Imperial Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1887, Jonas Jablonskis, who published an article in \"Varpas\" in 1893, and by , who published a collection of documents about Daukantas in the United States in 1898. In 1893, Lithuanian newspapers commemorated the 100th birth anniversary. On that occasion, Davainis-Silvestraitis brought a painter to talk to people who knew Daukantas while he was alive and create his portrait. The resulting portrait, though of low artistic quality, was published in United States in an album compiled by Antanas Milukas.\n\nIn 1901, Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas discovered the only known contemporary portrait, painted around 1850. Based on this portrait, Petras Rim≈°a created a plaster relief in 1905. In 1910, Daukantas' relatives transferred his manuscripts and library to the Lithuanian Scientific Society which promoted further study of his life and work. Historian published an extensive biography of Daukantas in 1913 and his surviving correspondence in 1922. Daukantas works were added to the Lithuanian school curriculum of Lithuanian literature. In 1924, Lithuanian teachers began raising funds for a monument to Daukantas. A bronze sculpture was designed by Vincas Grybas and erected in Papilƒó in 1930. Since that time, Daukantas life and works were subjects of numerous academic studies. Two volumes of his selected works were published in 1955 followed by reprints or first publications of his other works. His biography was published as separate monographs by Vytautas Merkys (1972, second edition 1991) and Saulius ≈Ωukas (1988). \n\nIn 1927, a bronze bust by sculptor Juozas Zikaras was erected in the garden of the Vytautas the Great War Museum in Kaunas (the bust was destroyed by Soviet authorities and restored in 1988). In 1983, Akmenƒó District Municipality turned the former clergy house in Papilƒó where Daukantas spent his last years into a memorial museum. From 1993 to the introduction of the euro in 2015, Daukantas was featured on 100 litas banknotes. A monument by sculptor Regimantas Midvikis in his native Lenkimai was unveiled in 1993. The Simonas Daukantas Award was established in 1989 for accomplishments in historical studies, literary work, or other cultural work. Awarded every two years, it is administered by the Skuodas District Municipality since 2003. Its past recipients included historians Vytautas Merkys, Alfredas Bumblauskas, Edvardas Gudaviƒçius, linguist Giedrius Subaƒçius. His place in Lithuanian history is also commemorated by Daukantas Square, facing the Presidential Palace in Vilnius. Seimas (Lithuanian parliament) declared 2018 as the year of Daukantas.\n\n"}
{"id": "92419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92419", "title": "Stanley Miller", "text": "Stanley Miller\n\nStanley Lloyd Miller (March 7, 1930 ‚Äì May 20, 2007) was an American chemist who made landmark experiments in the origin of life by demonstrating that a wide range of vital organic compounds can be synthesized by fairly simple chemical processes from inorganic substances. In 1952 he carried out the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment, which showed that complex organic molecules could be synthesised from inorganic precursors. The experiment was widely reported, and provided support for the idea that the chemical evolution of the early Earth had led to the natural synthesis of chemical building blocks of life from inanimate inorganic molecules. He has been described as the \"father of prebiotic chemistry\".\n\nStanley Miller was born in Oakland, California. He was the second child (after a brother, Donald) of Nathan and Edith Miller, descendants of Jewish immigrants from Belarus and Latvia. His father was an attorney and held the office of the Oakland Deputy District Attorney in 1927. His mother was a school teacher so that education was quite a natural environment in the family. In fact, while in Oakland High School he was nicknamed \"a chem whiz\". He followed his brother to the University of California at Berkeley to study chemistry mainly because he felt that Donald would be able to help him on the subject. He completed BSc in June 1951. For graduation course, he faced financial problems, as his father died in 1946 leaving the family with a money shortage. Fortunately with the help from Berkeley faculty (UC Berkeley did not then have assistantships), he was offered a teaching assistantship at the University of Chicago in February 1951, which could provide the basic funds for graduate work. He joined this post and got registered for a PhD program in September. He frantically searched for a thesis topic to work on, meeting one professor after another, and he was inclined toward theoretical problems as experiments tended to be laborious. He was initially convinced to work with the theoretical physicist Edward Teller on synthesis of elements. Following the customs of the university, where a graduate student is obliged to attend seminars, he attended a chemistry seminar in which the Nobel laureate Harold Urey gave a lecture on the origin of solar system and how organic synthesis could be possible under reducing environment such as the primitive Earth's atmosphere. Miller was immensely inspired. After a year of fruitless work with Teller, and the prospect of Teller leaving Chicago to work on the Hydrogen bomb, Miller was prompted to approach Urey in September 1952 for a fresh research project. Urey was not immediately enthusiastic on Miller's interest in pre-biotic synthesis, as no successful works had been done, and he even suggested working on thallium in meteorites. With persistence Miller persuaded Urey to pursue electric discharges in gases. He found clear evidence for the production of amino acids in the reaction vessel. He was always afraid that some specks of fly excrement might be the source of the amino acids he discovered in the reaction tube (or was so chided by his classmates). This was not the case and the result was a clear demonstration that a host of \"organic\" chemical compounds could be produced by purely inorganic processes. Miller eventually earned his doctorate degree in 1954, and a long-lasting reputation. From spectroscopic observations on stars, it is now well known that complex organic compounds are formed in the gases blown off of carbon rich stars as a result of chemical reactions. The fundamental issue of what the connection was between the \"pre-biotic organic\" compounds and the origin of life has remained.\n\nAfter completing a doctorate, Miller moved to the California Institute of Technology as a F. B. Jewett Fellow in 1954 and 1955. Here he worked on the mechanism involved in the amino and hydroxy acid synthesis. He then joined the Department of Biochemistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, where he worked for the next 5 years. When the new University of California at San Diego was established, he became the first Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry in 1960, and an Associate Professor in 1962, and then a full Professor in 1968.\n\nHe supervised 8 PhD students: Dennis Hafemann, Jeffrey L. Bada, Nadav Friedmann, James E. Van Trump, Gordon Schlesinger, William E. (Roscoe) Stribling, Jason P. Dworkin, and H. James Cleaves II.\n\nThe Miller experiment appeared in his technical paper in the 15 May 1953 issue of \"Science\", which transformed the concept of scientific ideas on the origin of life into a respectable realm of empirical inquiry. His study has become a classic textbook definition of the scientific basis of origin of life, or more specifically, the first definitive experimental evidence of the Oparin-Haldane's \"primordial soup\" theory. Urey and Miller designed to simulate the ocean-atmospheric condition of the primitive Earth by using a continuous run of steam into a mixture of methane (CH), ammonia (NH), and hydrogen (H). The gaseous mixture was then exposed to electrical discharge, which induced chemical reaction. After a week of reaction, Miller detected the formation of amino acids, such as glycine, Œ±- and Œ≤-alanine, using paper chromatography. He also detected aspartic acid and gamma-amino butyric acid, but was not confident because of the weak spots. Since amino acids are the basic structural and functional constituents of cellular life, the experiment showed the possibility of natural organic synthesis for the origin of life on earth.\n\nMiller showed his results to Urey, who suggested immediate publication. Urey declined to be the co-author lest Miller would receive little or no credit. The manuscript with Miller as the sole author was submitted to \"Science\" on 10 February 1953. After weeks of silence, Urey inquired and wrote to the chair of the editorial board on 27 February on the lack of action in reviewing the manuscript. A month passed, but still there was no decision. On 10 March the infuriated Urey demanded the manuscript to be returned, and he himself submitted it to the \"Journal of the American Chemical Society\" on 13 March. By then, the editor of \"Science\", apparently annoyed by Urey's insinuation, wrote directly to Miller that the manuscript was to be published. Miller accepted it and withdrew the manuscript from the \"Journal of the American Chemical Society\".\n\nMiller continued his research until his death in 2007. As the knowledge on early atmosphere progressed, and techniques for chemical analyses advanced, he kept on refining the details and methods. He not only succeeded in synthesising more and more varieties of amino acids, he also produced a wide variety of inorganic and organic compounds essential for cellular construction and metabolism. In support, a number of independent researchers also confirmed the range of chemical syntheses. With the most recent revelation that, unlike the original Miller's experimental hypothesis of strongly reducing condition, the primitive atmosphere could be quite neutral containing other gases in different proportions, Miller's last works, posthumously published in 2008, still succeeded in synthesising an array of organic compounds using such condition.\n\nIn 1972 Miller and his collaborators repeated the 1953 experiment, but with a newly developed automatic chemical analysers, such as ion-exchange chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. They synthesised 33 amino acids, including 10 that are known to naturally occur in organisms. These included all of the primary alpha-amino acids found in the Murchison meteorite, which fell on Australia in 1969. Subsequent electric discharge experiment actually produced more variety of amino acids than that in the meteorite.\n\nJust before Miller's death, several boxes containing vials of dried residues were found among his laboratory materials at the university. The note indicated that some were from his original 1952-1954 experiments, produced by using three different apparatuses, and one from 1958, which included HS in the gaseous mixture for the first time and the result never published. In 2008 his students re-analysed the 1952 samples using more sensitive techniques, such as high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography‚Äìtime of flight\nmass spectrometry. Their result showed the synthesis of 22 amino acids and 5 amines, revealing that the original Miller experiment produced many more compounds than actually reported in 1953. The unreported 1958 samples were analysed in 2011, from which 23 amino acids and 4 amines, including 7 organosulfur compounds, were detected.\n\nMiller suffered a series of strokes beginning in November, 1999 that increasingly inhibited his physical activity. He was living in a nursing home in National City, south of San Diego, and died on 20 May 2007 at the nearby Paradise Hospital. He is survived by his brother Donald and his family, and his devoted partner Maria Morris.\n\nMiller is remembered for his seminal works in the origin of life (and he was considered a pioneer in the field of exobiology), the natural occurrence of clathrate hydrates, and general mechanisms of action of anesthesia. He was elected to the US National Academy of Science in 1973. He was an Honorary Counselor of the Higher Council for Scientific Research of Spain in 1973. He was awarded the Oparin Medal by the International Society of the Study of the Origin of Life in 1983, and served as its President from 1986 to 1989.\n\nHe was nominated for Nobel Prize more than once, but never won any.\n\n\"Stanley L. Miller Award\" for young scientists under the age of 37 was instituted by the International Astrobiology Society since 2008.\n\n\n"}

It included a section that both Summers and Pritchett say was sarcastic that suggested dumping toxic waste in third-world countries for perceived economic benefits.\n\nAfter the material was leaked by Roberto Smeraldi of Friends of the Earth to \"Jornal do Brasil\" on February 2, 1992. Pritchett (who worked under Summers) stated that he had written the memo and Summers had only signed it, and that it was intended to be \"sarcastic\". According to Pritchett, the memo as leaked was doctored to remove context and intended irony, and was \"a deliberate fraud and forgery to discredit Larry and the World Bank\".\n\nDaniel Hausman and Michael McPherson have argued that the satirical section might seem to be based in economics as a science, but in fact contains strong moral premises which cannot be removed and still leave the argument intact. Brazilian Secretary of the Environment Jose Lutzenberger argued that it demonstrated \"the arrogant ignorance of many conventional 'economists' concerning the nature of the world we live in\".\n\nExtensive news articles and discussion regarding this memo were included in the US Senate hearing records for Summers' nomination to Secretary of the Treasury in 1993.\n\n"}
