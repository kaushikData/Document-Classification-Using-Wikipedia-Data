He was also a renowned judge and mathematician.\n\nAhmad ibn al-Qadi was born in 18 December 1552 in the Ibn al-qadi family. These latter belonged to the Zenata Berber tribal confederation, many of whose descendants were established in Fez and Meknes. The ibn al-qadi family gave birth to distinguished people, who, during the previous centuries, had held high political or religious offices and had become famous as islamic scholars.\n\nAhmad Ibn al-Qadi studied with Abd al-Wahid al-Sijilmasi, the famous Moroccan mufti and Ahmad Baba al Massufi. The jurisdiction of Salé was assigned to him. At the age of 34 he undertook a journey to the east, but his ship was captured by Christians. Ibn al-Qadi spent eleven months in captivity and was released thanks to sultan Ahmad al-Mansur who paid as ransom the equivalent of 20 thousand ounces of gold.\n\nA number of Ibn al-Qadi's works survive to this day. His primary panegyric work is entitled \"Al-Muntaqa al-maqsur 'ala ma'athir al-khilafat Abi al-Abbas al-Mansur\". This work consists mainly of a meditation upon the great character qualities of al-Mansur which, the scholar argues, showed him to be the rightful caliph of Islam. He also composed two collections of biographies of great documentary value: \"Jadwat al Iqtibas Fi-man halla min al'alam madinata fas\" (The Torch of learning in the recollection of the most influential notables of the city of Fez) and \"Durrat al-hidjāl fī asmā’ al-ridjāl\".\n\n"}

The area was visited frequently from the middle of the 17th century to the middle of the 18th century by privateers and buccaneers marauding Spanish colonial towns and the ships carrying gold to Europe. However little is known of the inhabitants of the region before the time of European contact. Archaeological research conducted since the middle of the 20th century has begun to illuminate the cultural history as well as development of societies in the region prior to Columbus arriving.\n\nBocas del Toro is one of ten provinces in the Republic of Panama, and is located in the western part of the country. It is bounded by the province of Chiriquí in the south, the province of Veraguas (including the Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca Comarca indígena) in the east, to the north is the Caribbean Sea and to the west is the Republic of Costa Rica. Bocas del Toro also refers to the archipelago which runs roughly northwest to southeast along the coast of the isthmus from the Seropta Peninsula to the Laguna de Chiriquí and includes the islands of Isla Colón, Isla Solarte, Isla Bastimentos, Isla San Cristóbal, Isla Popa, and Cayo Agua. The province is further divided into three districts: Chiriquí Grande, Changuinola, and Bocas del Toro. Major cities include Changuinola, Almirante, and Bocas del Toro or (Bocas Town) which is also the provincial capital and is located on Isla Colon.\nThe earliest archaeological research in the region was conducted by Mathew Stirling in 1953 and revealed the existence of shell middens along the coastal plain although very little was published about these. The geographer B.L. Gordon provided a more discerning interpretation of these middens and “began to develop a bio-cultural profile of the area”. Gordon’s excavations yielded mostly mollusk remains, although he described an unknown number of metates and a low density of both ceramic sherds and stone tools in the form of triangular celts. From 1971 through 1972 Olga Linares conducted test excavations at the Cerro Brujo shell midden site on the Aguacate Peninsula. This site is located on top of a ridgeline that divides Bahía Almirante from Laguna de Chiriquí, and is 3 km from the shoreline at approximately 140 m above sea level. She describes the site as a hamlet in which cultural material recovered from “two main midden clusters” show an occupation period of 20–30 years from five radiocarbon dates ranging from AD 960 to AD 985. A complete survey of the Aguacate Peninsula was conducted by Linares in 1973 and in addition to Cerro Brujo three similar shell midden sites were located.\n\nThe most recent site to be discovered and studied in the province is Sitio Drago on the northwest shore of Isla Colon, and has been investigated by Thomas A. Wake of the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA from 2002 to the present. This site is located on a “stabilized beach ridge” between the tropical forest of the interior of the island and the coral reef immediately offshore. The site is identified by approximately 15 low mounds of stratified midden over 17 hectares. Test excavations have produced “prestige goods, as well as a wider variety of general artefact types, and a greater diversity of ceramics than seen at Cerro Brujo”. Cultural material recovered include a wide variety of ceramic sherds and appliqué figurines which indicate interaction with the Pacific Chiriquí region, various stone tools (celts, blades), and a diverse collection of faunal remains (bone and mollusk). Radiocarbon dates from carbonized wood and Raphia nuts provide a timeframe of AD 900 to AD 1150 for the occupation period of the site. The diversity and density of the ceramics and other goods recovered from Sitio Drago have led Wake to surmise that “Sitio Drago is much larger and appears more internally complex than the loosely organized farming hamlets such as Cerro Brujo,”.\n\nFollowing Gordon, Linares surmised that the Bocas del Toro region was a marginal area to the supposedly larger and more complex culture area of Chiriquí on the Pacific coast of the isthmus of Panama. The paucity of sites, which appeared solely to be small hamlets identified by shell middens with a low density of stone artifacts, seemed to indicate a very low population spread out over a large area. The Bocas del Toro archipelago of islands was dismissed as having no significant importance, particularly because of Gordon’s assumption that the only sites off the mainland were similar small hamlets with shell middens, as reported to him (it is not mentioned who provided this information) on Isla Popa and Isla Cristóbal. Since the discovery and excavations at Sitio Drago, the Bocas del Toro region has been cast in a new light archaeologically. Wake argues that the assumptions made by Linares are empirically weak as they are based on a single excavated site and nominal investigation of the surrounding region. Diagnostic ceramics from Sitio Drago identified as Linarte Zoned Red Line ware and others “support the idea of trans-isthmian connections”. Additionally, the greater diversity and density of stone tools, faunal remains, and prestige items at a site contemporaneous with Cerro Brujo lend to the hypothesis that the region was more complex socio-politically than previously assumed and that it was an integral part of the “Greater Chiriquí interaction sphere”.\n\nAt this time Sitio Drago is still being investigated by Wake with colleagues Tomas Mendizabal and Alexis Mojica as the Proyecto Arqueológico Sitio Drago (PASD). In addition to publications forthcoming from Wake, Mendizabal, and Mojica, several new investigations are being conducted by students in coordination with PASD both at the site and in other parts of Isla Colón.\n\n \n"}

Among researchers of twentieth century anarchism he is also noted as an archivist.\n\nAurello Chessa was born in Putifigari, a village in the north western part of Sardinia. He enlisted as a sailor on 31 March 1931, as a result of which he came to spend long enough in Egypt to learn how to bake Egyptian bread. On 9 November 1939 he received a one-year prison sentence for insubordination, following which he spent four months from 24 October 1939 till 27 February 1940 in the San Francesco jail in Genoa. After the Second World War, in 1945 his maternal uncle, the anarchist Francesco Piras, who had introduced him to the Libertarian Movement fled to France: Chessa took over a large amount of his uncle's archival material on the movement, establishing the basis of a document collection that would grow during the ensuing decades.\n\nIn 1945 he started working as a functionary for the Italian State Railway Company. In 1946 he started contributing to \"Volontà\", a radical journal recently established by Giovanna Berneri, the widow of Camillo Berneri who had been assassinated in Barcelona a decade earlier. Chessa would continue to work on \"Volontà\" for many years. In 1947 he was a co-founder of a Genoa branch of the Italian Anarchist Federation (\"Federazione anarchica italiana\" / FAI), described in one source as a party of the \"anti-organisation tendency\". The FAI held a congress at Canossa in 1948 in which he participated, and on 1-2 May 1954 he presided at the FAI's national congress at Livorno as president of the congress, while insisting that he was participating in a personal capacity and not as the representative of any party, group or faction. \n\nOn 26 May 1958 Chessa found himself facing trial in a Genoa court, charged with \"Civil Disobedience\". The case involved his advocacy of abstention in that year's General Election. He was sentenced to a six-month prison term but given leave to appeal. At his appeal hearing, which took place on 23 December 1958, the court accepted a lesser charge of \"Instigation\", and a fine was substituted for imprisonment. In the same year he was writing articles under the pseudonym \"Paratacca\" on matters such as voting and democracy: these appeared in , a newspaper published in Carrara. Throughout this period he continued to work for the national railway company, and in 1960 his activist participation in the major strike of 8 June in Genoa earned him a reprimand from the railway management. Between 1964 and 1967 he wrote several articles about the trial. Meanwhile, in December 1965, he was a co-founder in Pisa of the \"Gruppo d'Iniziativa Anarquista\" (GIA), a breakaway faction from the FAI following policy differences.\n\nChessa's old friend Giovanna Berneri died in March 1962 her daughter, Giliana Berneri passed a large volume of papers on her parents' and grandparents' activist and writing careers within the Anarchist movement to him. Much of Aurelia Chessa's energy subsequently was devoted to ordering and maintaining what was now a large and growing archive of historical importance. On 4 April 1966 he retired after 22 years of service from his work with the railway and relocated from Genoa to Pistoia. The archive was housed successively in various locations including old churches in places that included Pistoia, Iglesias, Genoa, Canosa and Cecina. The which has been accommodated in the Biblioteca Panizzi (Panizzi Library) at Reggio Emilia since 1998.\n\nAurelio Chessa died in 1996 and his daughter, Fiamma Chessa, took on the task of curating the archive her father had accumulated and created.\n"}

In 2014, de Zegher published \"Women’s Work Is Never Done\", an anthology of her collected essays on the work of modern and contemporary women artists.\n\nCatherine de Zegher's most recent book is an anthology of collected essays on contemporary women artists written over 13 years: \"Women's Work Is Never Done\". In 2012, de Zegher edited \"All our relations\" (18th Biennale of Sydney). De Zegher wrote \"On Line.

In 2010 she has curated the exhibition \"Alma Matrix: Bracha Ettinger and Ria Verhaeghe\" in juxtaposition with \"Eva Hesse.

Her differences in vision with the Center's president, George Negroponte, with De Zegher focusing on exhibitions and Mr. Negroponte on building the center's artist services and on creating studio work space, a wel as objections to how much money Ms. de Zegher spent on shows at the Drawing Center, led to her resignation in the spring of 2006.\n\nShe was previously co-founder and Director of the Kanaal Art Foundation (Kortrijk, Belgium, 1988-1998) and in 1992 co-curated the large-scale exhibition \"America.

She co-edited with Carol Armstrong \"Women Artists at the Millennium\" (MIT Press).\n\nIn Fall 2017 the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent re-installed its permanent collection and included works by contemporary artists Luc Tuymans, Ria Verhaeghe and Patrick Van Caeckenbergh. The new installation also included a few Russian avantgarde works from the Dieleghem Foundation (Toporovski collection). In 2018, however, the Toporovski collection was claimed to be doubtful concerning their authenticity by a group of art dealers and some scholars in \"The Art Newspaper\" and \"De Standaard\". The Belgian news claimed that de Zegher insisted the MSK had done art historical research and also worked with two art historians, experts in the field of the Russian avantgarde, stating to be able to prove it with the needed documents. Both of the experts however denied having done an expertise on the works and said to have warned de Zegher not to exhibit the Toporovski collection. De Zegher disputed these claims, however she did not bring forth evidence supporting her own claims as requested by the local political opposition and by the museum board. The Director of the MSK and the City of Ghent closed the exhibition and terminated the contract with the owner so that the works could be returned. The latter stated that an investigation will be conducted to verify the authenticity of the works. Several Flemish museum directors critiqued the handling of de Zegher and the MSK. De Zegher held fast to her claim that they did all the necessary art historical research. A former exhibition in France featuring work from the Toporovski's was questioned as well, however the court ruled the paintings to be real. Due to the problems surrounding the collection, the museum board has ordered an audit on the event and has suspended de Zegher pending this process. The Flemish Parlement debated in Februari how to limit the negative effects of this controversy for other Belgian musea Currently the matter is in the hands of an investigating judge.. \n\nAfter 7 months of her suspension, 63 artists, among museum directors and intellectuals published a letter in support of Catherine de Zegher. Among those to have signed the letter include artists Eija-Liisa Ahtila, Luis Camnitzer, Cristina Iglesias, Simryn Gill, Mona Hatoum, Giuseppe Penone, Luc Tuymans, and Cecilia Vicuña; art historian Benjamin H. D. Buchloh; Catherine David, deputy director of the Centre Pompidou in Paris; Bartomeu Mari, director of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Seoul; and Ann Gallagher, director of Tate Modern’s British Art collections. The letter reads:\n\nOn October 17th 2018 De Zegher organised a press conference during which she stated that several of the works in the show had since been tested in laboratories and were proven to consist of materials dating from the perod to which they were attributed. She also repeated her earlier statement that art-historical research had been undertaken. No documentary proof was presented, stating instead that evidence would be revealed at a later date. In a simultaneous statement, De Zegher referred to a book to be published in 2019 which will reveal the entire story. \nOn November 5th the International Committee for Museums and Collections of Modern Art (CiMAM) issued a statement in support of Catherine de Zegher. The full statement reads: \n\n\"“In its capacity as the international association for Museums and Collections of Modern and Contemporary art, and as an affiliate of ICOM, CIMAM wishes to register its deep concern at the treatment of Catherine de Zegher in her capacity as Director of the Museum of Fine Arts (MSK) in Ghent.

Dibble (18 August 1909 – 30 November 2002) was an American academic, anthropologist, linguist, and scholar of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures. A former Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the University of Utah, Dibble retired in 1978 after an association with the university as lecturer and researcher spanning four decades. Post-retirement Dibble continued to conduct and publish research in his area of expertise, studies of Mesoamerican historical literature and the historiography of conquest-era Mesoamerican cultures, in particular those of the Aztec and others of the central Mexican \"altiplano\". Among many contributions to the field Dibble is perhaps most recognised for his collaboration with colleague Arthur J.O. Anderson, producing the modern annotated translation into English of the volumes of the Florentine Codex.\n\nBorn in Layton, Utah, Dibble attended the University of Utah, obtaining a B.A. in history in 1936. Dibble traveled to Mexico in the year preceding his graduation, and his experiences there shaped the direction of his future career as a Mesoamericanist scholar. Dibble enrolled at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) in Mexico City for postgraduate studies, completing a Master's degree in anthropology in 1938. Upon receiving his MA Dibble gained a teaching position at his \"alma mater\" in Utah commencing in 1939, where he would be based for the remainder of his long academic career. At the same time he pursued his doctoral studies at UNAM, and was awarded his PhD from UNAM in 1942. Dibble also undertook a year's post-doctoral work at Harvard, in 1943. In 1994, a festschrift entitled \"Chipping away on earth: studies in prehispanic and colonial Mexico in honor of Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles E. Dibble\" was published.\n"}
{"id": "20155525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20155525", "title": "Cliodynamics", "text": "Cliodynamics\n\nCliodynamics () is a transdisciplinary area of research integrating cultural evolution, economic history/cliometrics, macrosociology, the mathematical modeling of historical processes during the \"longue durée\", and the construction and analysis of historical databases. Cliodynamics treats history as science. Its practitioners develop theories that explain such dynamical processes as the rise and fall of empires, population booms and busts, spread and disappearance of religions. These theories are translated into mathematical models. Finally, model predictions are tested against data. Thus, building and analyzing massive databases of historical and archaeological information is one of the most important goals of cliodynamics.\n\nThe word \"cliodynamics\" is composed of \"clio-\" and \"-dynamics\". In Greek mythology, Clio is the muse of history. Dynamics, most broadly, is the study of how and why phenomena change with time.\n\nThe term was originally coined by Peter Turchin in 2003, and can be traced to the work of such figures as Ibn Khaldun Alexandre Deulofeu, Jack Goldstone, Sergey Kapitsa, Randall Collins, John Komlos, and Andrey Korotayev.\n\nMany historical processes are dynamic (a dynamic process is one that changes with time). Populations increase and decline, economies expand and contract, states grow and collapse. A very common approach, which has proved its worth in innumerable applications (particularly, but not exclusively, in the natural sciences), consists of taking a holistic phenomenon and splitting it up into separate parts that are assumed to interact with each other. This is the dynamical systems approach, because the whole phenomenon is represented as a system consisting of several elements (or subsystems) that interact and change dynamically; that is, over time. In the dynamical systems approach, one sets out explicitly with mathematical formulae how different subsystems interact with each other. This mathematical description is the model of the system, and one can use a variety of methods to study the dynamics predicted by the model, as well as attempt to test the model by comparing its predictions with observed empirical, dynamic evidence. Cliodynamics is the application of this same approach to the social sciences in general and to the study of historical dynamics in particular.\n\nCliodynamics practitioners apply mathematical models to explain macrohistorical patterns – things like the rise of empires, social discontent, civil wars, and state collapse. Although the focus is usually on the dynamics of large conglomerates of people, the approach of cliodynamics does not preclude the inclusion of human agency in its explanatory theories. Such questions can be explored with agent-based computer simulations.\n\nCliodynamics relies on large bodies of evidence to test competing theories on a wide range of historical processes. This typically involves building massive stores of evidence. The rise of digital history and various research technologies have allowed huge databases to be constructed in recent years. Some prominent databases utilized by cliodynamics practitioners include the following:\n\nAs of 2016, the main directions of academic study in cliodynamics are:\n\nThere are several established venues of peer reviewed cliodynamics research: \n\nCritics of the Cliodynamic approach often argue that the complex social formations of the past cannot and should not be reduced to quantifiable, analyzable 'data points', for doing so overlooks each historical society's peculiar circumstances and dynamics. Many historians and social scientists contend that there are no generalizable causal factors that can explain large numbers of cases, but that historical investigation should focus on the unique trajectories of each case, highlighting commonalities in outcomes where they exist. As Zhao notes, \"most historians believe that the importance of any mechanisms in history changes, and more important, there is no time-invariant structure that can organize all the historical mechanisms into a system\". Cliodynamicists, on the other hand, contend that there are large-scale, macrohistorical patterns that can explain the historical dynamics of the majority of known cases, and that these patterns can be uncovered through systematic, mathematical analysis. They argue that the ability of cliodynamics research to expose these patterns and to explain historical events demonstrates the feasibility of the approach.\n\nIsaac Asimov employed a fictional version of this discipline, what he called psychohistory, as a major plot device in his Foundation series of science fiction novels.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33906116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33906116", "title": "Dachauer Straße", "text": "Dachauer Straße\n\nThe Dachauer Straße is the longest street in Munich with a length of 11.2 km and is received its named since it is the connecting road to Dachau Palace. In the north of Munich, it is part of the \"Bundesstraße 304\".\n\nThe Dachauer Straße begins today as a track-leading street of the tram lines 20 and 21 north of the Bahnhofplatz in the district of Maxvorstadt. Until 1877, the southern part of today's Dachauer Sraße to the height of Marsstraße was still part of the Schützenstraße. From Hirtenstraße, the Dachauer Straße then also serves for use by motor vehicle traffic, until Elisenstraße, as a one-lane One-way traffic and then carries on to the Stiglmaierplatz with two opposing lanes. From Stiglmaierplatz, the street picks up the multi-lane traffic coming from the south to Seidlstraße, where it mostly has two lanes through Neuhausen-Nymphenburg, to which it then crosses Leonrodplatz and leads to the height of the Olympic Park under the Landshuter Allee (Mittlerer Ring) through to the district of Moosach. There it crosses at the junction of Wintrich- with the Georg-Brauchle-Ring, at the intersection it once again like the Baubergerstraße and the Pelkovenstraße, continues on with single lanes on both sides and a little further north in Feldmoching-Hasenbergl after a bend below the track of the DB marshalling yard in a western direction, continues as a multi-lane road part of the national road 304. In this bend, the Max-Born-Straße from the East ends here and forms the further course of the national road 304. The Dachauer Straße then leads in a northwesterly direction over the railway tracks and the A 99 to the city or county boundary, where it continues in Karlsfeld under the name Münchner Straße. The northern route of the Dachauer Straße has been changed over time. In the former village Moosach, the old Dachauer Straße ran, since the middle of the 12th century, on the route of the today's Darmstädter, Batzenhofer and Quedlinburger Straße and received there direct route starting in the middle of the 18th century. Due to the construction of the marshalling yard Munich North between 1987 and 1991, the road was routed over the tracks again another 400m to the west.\n\nAs of 1448, horse races were held every year during the Jakobidult on the route from Neuhauser Tor to Feldmoching, which is why the route was known until 1878 as \"Rennweg\". In the Middle Ages, around 1660, the part of the street close to the city bore the name Mosserstraße, derived from \"Mossach\", since it led from Munich to Moosach.\n\nThe structural development of the area more remote from the old town began with the construction of several barracks of the Bavarian Army with its associated infrastructure. Therefore, the then rural environment of Neuhausen was redesigned from the mid-19th century, which brought the district south of the practice area Oberwiesenfeld and north of the parade grounds Marsfeld the name \"barracks district\" and significantly accelerated the structural change Neuhausens. From 1866, extensive workshops of the royal armory were built along the Dachauer Straße; at times, more than 1,000 workers were employed there. The last still existent military-related institution is the \"Bundeswehrverwaltungszentrum München\" (Army Administrative Center Munich). It is located on the site of the former \"Eisenbahnkaserne\" (railway barracks) number 128.\n\nIn 1869, Adele Spitzeder founded her private bank in Dachauer Straße, which became known as \"Dachauer Banken\". On 21 October 1876, the first Munich horse tram passed on its route from Promenadeplatz to Nymphenburger Straße/Burgfriedensgrenze (Maillingerstraße) the Dachauer Straße between Bahnhofplatz and Stiglmaierplatz. In 1898, the west bordering cemetery was built. In 1900 the tram route from 1876 was made electric. On the western side opposite the \"Bundeswehrverwaltungszentrum München\" (Army Administrative Center Munich), the Association for the Improvement of Housing in Munich built a small residential complex in the Ebenau district even before the First World War, which was used as one of the early examples of non-profit housing construction in Munich. In 1905, the current Heinz Naumann House (number 25) was built by Michael Reifenstuel, which then served as a posthospital. After the former gas works on the Thalkirchner road and the Kirchstein (now Vogelweideplatz) could not keep up with the growing gas demand of the city, the construction of the gas works Moosach, now number 148, began in 1906. On 25 July 1909, the new tram connection from Stiglmaier to Leonrodplatz was first used. In the restaurant \"Zum Deutschen Reich\", located on Dachauer Straße, the German Workers' Party organized meetings in 1919 and 1920, with Adolf Hitler as speaker. Between 1924 and 1929, the Borstei was built north of the Middle Ring. In 1928, depot 5 for trams was completed in the Dachauer Straße 104, which was put back into service in 1949 after the damages from the war were repaired and then shut down in 1977. After request of the realm aviation ministry from 1936, development too place on the current factory premises of MTU Aero Engines (Dachauer Straße 665) and MAN commercial vehicles (Dachauer Straße 667) another BMW factory, which produced the 801 engine starting in 1942. During the period of National Socialism, innumerable so-called protective prisoners were deported via the Dachauer Straße to the Dachau concentration camp. After a bomb attack by the Allies in 1943, the gas plant was severely damaged. The ordered demolition of the plant was prevented by the factory management. After the war, the plant had to be shut down for half a year because of the damages caused by the war. After the conversion of the gas supply to Roherd gas took place on 10 November 1975, the plant was closed. In 2008, sections of the tram tracks in Dachauer Straße were renewed.\n\nThe that poststall of the city was also located on the street. The former post office on Dachauer Straße was built by Franz Holzhammer. In addition, Dachauer Straße 90 is home to the Municipal Health Department and the blood doner service of the \"Städtische Klinikum München GmbH\". In the former buildings of the police driving school, the department city center of the Munich Fire Department is temporarily accommodated there for some years.\n\nIn 1951, an elementary school was built on the Dachauer Straße for the children of the Ludwigsfelder camp, and in 1963, at number 98, a primary school was built. In addition, the Munich Educational Plant is located at Dachauer Straße 5 and the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Vehicle Technology and Aircraft Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Munich at Dachauer Straße 98b.\n\nIn the area of gastronomy, located next to the \"Löwenbräukeller\" at the intersecting Stiglmaierplatz is one of the oldest guest houses in Munich called \"Alter Wirt\" in Moosach, which was first documented in 1442 as a \"Täfernhaus\". In 1906, Carl Gabriel had the first \"Lichtspielhaus\" (Movie theater) in Munich built on Dachauer Straße under the name \"The American Bio.-Cie.\", which still exists today after several renovations under the name of Gabriel Filmtheater. Even after the First World War, the Apollo Theater (house numbers 19/21) is located opposite the confluence of Augustenstraße. The actor Karl Valentin performed on stage at the \"Baderwirt\" under the name \"Skeleton Giggerl\". Since the early 1980s, the Munich Theater for children, which was previously housed on the Leopoldstraße, is located in the building of the former \"Regina-Lichtspielhauses\" at Dachauer Straße 46 and in 1982, the Pathos Transport Theater was founded on Dachauer Straße 110 d. In the 1980s, parts of the abandoned military properties in Dachauer Straße 128, which now houses a housing estate and the headquarters of the \"Goethe-Institut\", were used for theater and event purposes. Where the artillery workshops were before the Second World War, was until the renovations were completed on the main building, a theater of the Munich Kammerspiele in a converted industrial hall of \"Stadtwerke München\" which was classified as a demolition object and only provisionally kept intact. From the spring of 2003 until the beginning of 2010, the event technology of the cultural department and the rooms of the Academy of Fine Arts were housed in the same property on Dachauer Straße 114. There today is the \"Schwere Reiter Theater\".\n\n\n"}

Before retiring from teaching, Baldwin had previously worked as a lecturer at both the University of Leicester and the University of Nottingham. In 1986, over 25 years before the 2012 excavation and the discovery of the king's body, he predicted that Richard III's remains would be found at Greyfriars, Leicester.\n\nIn his 2010 book, \"Robin Hood: The English Outlaw Unmasked\", Baldwin argued that the 'real' Robin Hood was Roger Godberd, a disinherited supporter of Simon de Montfort. He drew attention to the many similarities between Godberd's career and the stories told of Robin in the earliest ballads, and to a grave slab in Loxley churchyard in Warwickshire which appeared to be identical to one associated with Robin in earlier centuries.\n\nIn his 2007 book, \"The Lost Prince: The Survival of Richard of York\", Baldwin discussed the possibility that the younger of the Princes in the Tower, Prince Richard, survived, and was the \"Richard Plantagenet\" who died in December 1550 at Eastwell in Kent.

{"id": "6145428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6145428", "title": "Docket (court)", "text": "Docket (court)\n\nA docket in the United States is the official summary of proceedings in a court of law. In the United Kingdom in modern times it is an official document relating to delivery of something, with similar meanings to these two elsewhere. In the late nineteenth century the term referred to a large folio book in which clerks recorded all filings and court proceedings for each case, although use has been documented since 1485.\n\nThe term originated in England; it was recorded in the form \"doggette\" in 1485, and later also as doket, dogget(t), docquett, docquet, and docket. The derivation and original sense are obscure, although it has been suggested that it derives from the verb \"to dock\", in the sense of cutting short (e.g. the tail of a dog or horse); a long document summarised has been \"docked\", or \"docket\" using old spelling. It was long used in England for legal purposes (there was an official called the Clerk of the Dockets in the early nineteenth century), although discontinued in modern English legal usage.\n\n\"Docket\" was described in \"The American and English Encyclopedia of Law\" as a courts summary, digest, or register. A usage note in this 1893 text warns that term docket and calendar are not synonymous.\n\nA 1910 law dictionary states the terms \"trial docket\" and \"calendar\" are synonymous.\n\nIn the United States, court dockets are considered to be public records, and many public records databases and directories include references to court dockets. Rules of civil procedure often state that the court clerk shall record certain information \"on the docket\" when a specific event occurs. The Federal Courts use the PACER (Public Access Court Electronic Records) system to house dockets and documents on all federal civil, criminal and bankruptcy cases, available to the public for a fee.\n\nThe term is also sometimes used informally to refer to a court calendar, the schedule of the appearances, arguments and/or hearings scheduled for a court. It may also be used as a metonym to refer to a court's caseload as a whole. Thus, either sense may be intended (depending upon the context) in the frequent use of the phrase \"crowded dockets\" by legal journalists and commentators.\n\nIn its meaning as \"calendar\", the docket of the United States Supreme Court is different both in its composition and significance. The justices of the Supreme Court have almost complete discretion over the cases they choose to hear. From the large number of cases which it receives, only 70 to 100 will be placed on the docket. The Solicitor General decides which cases to present on behalf of the federal government.\n\n\n\"P\"ublic \"A\"ccess to \"C\"ourt \"E\"lectronic \"R\"ecords (PACER) is a system for public access to court records, subject to payment.\n\n\n\n"}

According to the Mahavamsa, the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka are the Yakshas and northern Naga tribes. Sinhalese history traditionally starts in 543 BC at the arrival of Prince Vijaya, a semi-legendary king who was banished from the Indian subcontinent with his 700 followers, and is recorded in the Mahavamsa chronicle. This period was succeeded by the Anuradhapura period.\n\nAccording to folklore, the Naga people were one of the groups of original inhabitants of Lanka. They were said to have ruled Nagadeepa, or Jaffna Peninsula and Kelaniya. Naga people were snake-worshipers. The word Naga was sometimes written in early inscriptions as Nāya, as in Nāganika – this occurs in the Nanaghat inscription of 150 BC. Until the third century BC they appear as a distinct group in the early Sri Lankan chronices as well as the early Tamil literary works. In the third century BC they started to assimilate to Tamil language and culture, and lost their separate identity.\n\nThe Kingdom of Tambapanni existed from 543 BC to 505 BC. According to \"Mahavamsa\", the legendary Prince Vijaya and seven hundreds of his followers came to Sri Lanka after being expelled from Sinhapura in India. Vijaya is said to have landed on the island on the day of Gautama Buddha's death, and after reaching the heaven, the Buddha asked the deities to protect him so that he could spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Prince Vijaya established the Kingdom of Tambapanni. He married a local Yakkhini named Kuveni, and their children gave rise to the Pulinda race (identified with the Vedda people). Vijaya also married a princess of the Pandu kingdom (identified with Pandyan kingdom), but did not have any children with her. His followers also married maidens sent by the Pandu king, and their descendants gave rise to the Sinhalese race.\n\nThe Kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara existed from 505 to 377 BC when the ruling monarch, Pandukabhaya moved the administration to Anuradhapura. Pandukabhaya was the last monarch of Upatissa Nuwara and the first of Anuradhapura.\n\nThe Pali chronicles, the Dipavamsa, Mahavamsa, Thupavamsa and the Culavamsa as well as a large collection of stone inscriptions, the Indian Epigraphical records, the Burmese versions of the chronicles etc., provide an exceptional record for the history of Sri Lanka from about the sixth century BC.\n\nThe Mahavamsa, written around 400 AD, using the Dipavamsa, the Attakatha and other written sources available, it correlates well with Indian histories of the period. Emperor Asoka's reign is recorded in the Mahavamsa. The Mahavamsa account of the period prior to Asoka's coronation, (218 years after the Buddha's death) seems to be part legend. The account of the Mahavamsa, a Pali text written largely from the Sinhalese perspective, has mythological beginnings but becomes historical from the third century BC, with the arrival of Buddhism under Devanampiya Tissa of Sri Lanka. Epigraphic sources also appear with the presence of Buddhism, from about the third century BC. The earliest historiographic litearature, such as the Mahavamsa, dates to the sixth century AD. The entire ancient period of history written in the Mahavamsa, is dominated by the Anuradhapura Kingdom. The medieval period in Sri Lanka is taken to begin with the fall of the Anuradhapura Kingdom in AD 1017.\n\nWithin Sri Lanka, the legend of Vijaya is often treated as a factual account of a historical event. However, multiple scholars consider the legend of dubious historicity. Satchi Ponnambalam called it a \"pure flight of fantasy\". According to Gavin Thomas, the narration of historical events in \"Mahavamsa\" and its continuation \"Culavamsa\" is \"at best questionably-biased, and at worst totally imaginary\", aimed at establishing the royal lineage of the Sinhalese and the Buddhist credentials of the island. According to H.W. Codrington, Vijaya is probably a composite character, and the legend is aimed at connecting the early history of Sri Lanka with that of Buddha.\n\nThe House of Vijaya produced four monarchs and two regents who ruled during this period. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

Ferguson\n\nEugene Shallcross Ferguson (1916 – 21 March 2004) was an American engineer, historian of technology and professor of history at the University of Delaware, particularly known for his 1992 work \"Engineering and the Mind's Eye.\"\n\nFerguson was born in Wilmington, Delaware, and raised in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. He obtained his BS in mechanical engineering at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1937. A part of the curriculum consisted of regular tours to the plants of heavy industry in the region. In 1955 he obtained MS in mechanical engineering at Iowa State College, with the thesis entitled \"Development of the Engineering Profession in America, 1815–1900.\"\n\nAfter graduation Ferguson started working in production planning at Western Electric Company in Baltimore. He was also refinery operator at Gulf Refining in Philadelphia shortly before in 1938 starting as construction and maintenance engineer at DuPont. Here he worked in chemical plants that were highly explosive. He later recalled that it was more or less his job \"to map where projectiles, including body parts, landed following accidental explosions at the plants so as to understand better what had happened and how to improve both processes and equipment.\" At DuPont he became head of the department, and continued working in numerous plants in the region of Pittsburgh.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1946 Ferguson served as ordnance officer in the United States Navy in World War II. He was stationed in the South Pacific, and back in the States at the Charleston Naval Shipyard in North Charleston, South Carolina. In 1945 he encountered naval commander Robert W. Copeland, who lectured Ferguson in naval history and inspired him to turn to the history of technology. Later hospitalized in a navy hospital, he studied American naval biographies. Here he got the idea to write the first biography on Thomas Truxton, commander of a number of famous US naval ships including and , later in 1956 published as \"Truxtun of the Constellation: The Life of Commodore Thomas Truxtun, U.S. Navy, 1755–1822.\"\n\nAfter the war in 1946 Ferguson started his academic career as assistant professor at the Iowa State College, teaching mechanical engineering. In between he worked in industry one last time as plant engineer for the Foote Mineral Company in Exton, Pennsylvania. He returned to the Iowa State College, where in 1969 he was promoted to associate professor. In those years he was inspired by the Iowa State historian of agriculture Earle Dudley Ross (1885–1973) and Harvard's first professor of oceanic history Robert G. Albion, to specialize in the history of science. From 1969 to his retirement in 1979 Ferguson was professor of history at the University of Delaware. In Delaware he was also curator of technology at the Hagley Museum and Library.\n\nFerguson was a founding member of the Society for the History of Technology and its eleventh president (1977–78). The Society recognized Ferguson's contribution by creating \"The Eugene S. Ferguson Prize for Outstanding Reference Work\". in 1977 Ferguson himself was awarded the Leonardo da Vinci Medal, the highest award of the Society for the History of Technology.\n\nFerguson wrote three major works on the history of technology, starting with \"Kinematics of Mechanisms from the Time of Watt\" in 1962, and further \"Bibliography of the History of Technology.\" in 1968, and \"Engineering and the Mind's Eye\" in 1994. He also contributed to the Propædia, the first of three parts of the 15th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.\n\nFerguson's 1977 paper in \"Science\", entitled \"The mind's eye: Nonverbal thought in technology\", is credited for clarifying the role of visual reasoning in the thinking process. In this article he reasoned that \"Thinking with pictures is an essential strand in the intellectual history of technological development.\" He concludes his article with the following statement:\n\nIn his work claims Ferguson that visual reasoning is a widely used tool used in creating technological artefacts. There is ample evidence that visual methods, particularly drawing, play a central role in creating artefacts.\n\nFerguson later expanded its themes into his 1992 book, \"Engineering and the mind's eye\". This work wanted to demonstrate that \"engineering is as much a matter of intuition and nonverbal thinking as of equations and computation.\" It also argued that, the \"system of engineering education that ignores nonverbal thinking will produce engineers who are dangerously ignorant of the many ways in which the real world differs from the mathematical models constructed in academic minds.\"\n\nOne of the chapters is devoted to the tools of visualisation, and traces back their origin to the Renaissance. The inventions of printing, linear perspective and projective geometry significantly enhanced man's ability to convey vision into precise drawings, and exactly duplicate it by printing. These images, as William Ivins, Jr. (1953) had argued, were more than just artistic impression. According to Ivins, the \"importance of being able exactly to repeat pictorial statements is undoubtedly greater for science, technology, and general information than it is for art.\"\n\nNowadays modern projects, Ferguson argued, can require up to thousands of different drawings and charts. For example, in the production of the British VC-10 airplane over 50.000 production drawings were used. Working with the various contractors and suppliers is unthinkable, without the exact duplication.\n\n\nArticles, a selection:\n\nDavid A. Hounshell 2004. Eugene S.

{"id": "17413630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17413630", "title": "Homosexuality in ancient Egypt", "text": "Homosexuality in ancient Egypt\n\nHomosexuality in ancient Egypt is a passionately disputed subject within Egyptology: historians and egyptologists alike debate what kind of view the ancient Egyptians' society fostered about homosexuality. Only a handful of direct hints still survive and many possible indications are only vague and offer plenty of room for speculation.\n\nThe best known case of possible homosexuality in ancient Egypt is that of the two high officials Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep. Both men lived and served under pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th Dynasty (c. 2494–2345 BC). Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same mastaba tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in ancient Egypt the nose-on-nose touching normally represented a kiss.\n\nEgyptologists and historians disagree about how to interpret the paintings of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep. Some scholars believe that the paintings reflect an example of homosexuality between two married men and prove that the ancient Egyptians accepted same-sex relationships. Other scholars disagree and interpret the scenes as an evidence that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep were twins, even possibly conjoined twins. No matter what interpretation is correct, the paintings show at the very least that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep must have been very close to each other in life as in death.\n\nA well known story, dating back to the Middle Kingdom, tells about an anonymous citizen, who comes to the audience hall of king Pepi II (here named by his birth name, \"Neferkarê\"). The citizen wants to lament about an unnamed circumstance, but the king does not want to listen to the laments, so he orders his royal musicians to drown the stranger's speech with noise. Disappointed, the stranger leaves the palace. When this happens several times, he orders his friend, the high official \"Tjeti\", to follow the king. The king in turn is frequently leaving the palace during the night. Tjeti finds out that king Pepi II keeps visiting his loyal general officer \"Sasenet\" for several hours, then returning home.\n\nThe chapter in which king Pepi II visits his loyal general officer is subject of passionate discussions. Especially one certain phrase stays in the centre of investigations: the text says, that \"his majesty went into Sasenet's house and did to him what his majesty desired\". The phrase \"doing what one desires\" is a common flowery phrase to describe sex. For this reason, some scholars are convinced, that the papyrus reveals king Pepi's homosexual interests and his same-sex relationship to his general officer. But other scholars are instead convinced, that the passage is merely an allegoric pun to religious texts, in which the sun god Râ visits the underworld god Osiris during the middle four hours of the night. Thus, king Pepi II would be taking the role of Râ and Sasenet would take the role of Osiris. The phrase \"doing what one desires\" would therefore be overrated and misinterpreted. \nA further famous story about same-sex intercourse can be found in the Kahun Papyri, dating back to the Middle Kingdom. It contains the nearly completely preserved story of the Osiris myth and the legendary fight for the throne of Egypt between Horus and Seth. The chapter in question reports that Seth was unutterably jealous about his young nephew Horus, because Horus was very young and popular. He was quite pampered by the other gods. Seth instead had very few companions and he was comparatively unpopular because of his choleric and vindictive behaviour. As a result, Seth tried to either chase away or even kill Horus, no matter what the cost. When Seth constantly fails, he plans to humiliate his rival so badly that Horus would be banned from Egypt forever. Seth invites Horus to a party and convinces the teenage Horus to drink more than Horus could normally cope with. When Horus is drunk, Seth seduces him to sleep over the night in one bed together. When lying together in one bed, Seth grabs Horus and rapes him. But Horus has tricked Seth; his drunkenness was staged. He catches Seth's semen with his hands and hides it. Next morning, Horus runs to his Mother, Isis, to tell her what happened. Isis is first speechless with rage and disbelief. Then she tells Horus' to masturbate, using his semen to lubricate Seth's favorite food (Egyptian lettuce). Totally clueless, Seth eats the manipulated lettuce, then he goes to the divine court to inform on Horus. At first, the divine judges swear at Horus, but when Thoth, the scribe of the court, calls for Seth's semen to emerge from the body of Horus, instead the semen of Horus emerges from the body of Seth. Seth blushes in embarrassment and shock, then flees. Horus is acquitted.\n\nThe famous rape of Horus by his jealous uncle is also subject of passionate discussions. While most scholars agree that the papyrus clearly describes rape, it must remain open, if it actually describes a homosexually driven deed. Background of the dispute are Seth's motives: he does not love Horus; in contrast, he hates his nephew and the rape was clearly performed to humiliate Horus. The only common ground between the rape and homosexuality is that the act was of same-sex nature. But some scholars are not so sure and point out, that Seth was often credited with questionable sexual interests.\n\nIt remains unclear, what exact view the ancient Egyptians fostered about homosexuality. Any document and literature that actually contains sexual orientated stories, never name the nature of the sexual deeds, but instead uses stilted and flowery paraphrases. While the stories about Seth and his sexual behavior may reveal rather negative thoughts and views, the tomb inscription of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep may instead suggest that homosexuality was likewise accepted. Ancient Egyptian documents never clearly say that same-sex relationships were seen as reprehensible or despicable. No ancient Egyptian document mentions that homosexual acts were set under penalty. Thus, a straight evaluation remains problematic.\n\nIn Talmudic literature, the ancient Egyptians are known for their liberal sexual lifestyles and are often used as the prime example of sexual debauchery. Rashi describes an Egyptian practice for women to have multiple husbands. Maimonides refers to lesbianism as \"the acts of Egypt\". While polyandry and lesbianism are characteristics of the ancient Egyptians, male-male homosexual relationships are usually attributed to Sodom, Gomorrah, and Amalek.\n\n"}
{"id": "197781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197781", "title": "Hydatius", "text": "Hydatius\n\nHydatius, also spelled Idacius (c. 400 – c. 469), bishop of Aquae Flaviae in the Roman province of Gallaecia (almost certainly the modern Chaves, Portugal, in the modern district of Vila Real) was the author of a chronicle of his own times that provides us with our best evidence for the history of Hispania (that is, the Iberian Peninsula in Roman times) in the 5th century.\n\nHydatius was born around the year 400 in the environs of Civitas Lemica, a Roman town near modern Xinzo de Limia in the Spanish Galician province of Ourense. As a young boy, he travelled as a pilgrim to the Holy Land with his mother, where he met Jerome in his hermitage at Bethlehem. About the year 417 he joined the clergy, and in 427 was consecrated bishop probably of Chaves (the Roman \"Aquae Flaviae\") in Gallaecia. As bishop he had to come to terms with the presence of non-Roman powers, especially a succession of kings of the Suevi, in a province where imperial control became increasingly nominal during the course of his lifetime. The Suevi had settled in Gallaecia in 411, and there was constant friction between them and the local Hispano-Roman provincials. In this context, Hydatius took part in a deputation of the year 431 requesting assistance in dealing with the Suevi from the general Flavius Aëtius, the most important representative of the imperial government in the West.\n\nAlong with this concern, Hydatius devoted himself to rooting out heresy, not just in his own episcopal diocese, but in the rest of Hispania as well. He was in frequent contact with some important bishops of the day, including Thoribius of Astorga and Antoninus of Mérida. Together with Thoribius, he petitioned Pope Leo I for assistance and advice in dealing with heresy. Though Hydatius consistently characterizes Iberian heretics as Manichees, it is generally believed that he meant Priscillianists, followers of the ascetic bishop Priscillian, who had been condemned as a heretic by several church councils and executed as a magician by the emperor Magnus Maximus around 385. We know very little else about Hydatius's life, though we know he was kidnapped and imprisoned for a time in 460 by local enemies, which suggests he played an important role in the internal politics of Roman Gallaecia.\n\nHydatius probably died in 468 or shortly after, since at that point his chronicle breaks off abruptly.\n\nHydatius's main claim to historical importance is the chronicle he wrote towards the end of his life. The chronicle was an historical genre very popular in Late Antiquity, though with precedents in older chronographic genres like the \"Fasti consulares\". A consciously Christian genre, the main goal of the chronicle was to place human history in the context of a linear progression from creation according Genesis to the Second Coming of Christ. Under the entry for each year one or several events were listed, usually with great brevity. The greatest exponent of the form had been the fourth-century bishop Eusebius of Caesarea. Jerome brought the Greek chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea up to date as far as the year 378, after translating it into Latin. Jerome's translation and continuation proved very popular, and others decided to continue Jerome in the same way.\n\nHydatius was one such continuator. His continuation begins with a preface explaining his debt to Jerome, and then picks up in the year 379. Hydatius had access to a number of chronographic and historical sources and used four parallel chronological systems. Because of this, and particularly towards the end of the chronicle, it can be difficult to translate his chronology into any modern calendar. At the beginning, Hydatius's continuation offers relatively little information for each year. He narrates the events from 427 onward as a contemporary witness and the text becomes increasingly full as the years progress until it resembles an organic literary work more than a typical chronicle.\n\nHydatius's main concern throughout is to show the dissolution of civil society in the western Roman empire and in Hispania in particular, and he paints a very dark picture of fifth-century life. His deep pessimism may stem from a belief in the imminent end of the world, since he had read the apocryphal letter of Christ to Thomas, which was interpreted to show that the world would end in May 482. Hydatius may thus have believed that he was chronicling the world's last days, and on occasion he deliberately distorted his account to show events in a gloomier light. This is especially true of the narrative climax of his account, the sack in 456 of the Suevi capital at Braga by the Visigothic king Theodoric II, acting in the service of the Roman emperor Avitus. Regardless of his sometimes very sophisticated literary devices, Hydatius's chronicle is an essential source of information for reconstructing the course of fifth-century events. Moreover, it is our only source for the history of Hispania in the period up to 468, at which point the narrative breaks off.\n\nIt is doubtful whether Hydatius is also the author of the \"Fasti consulares\" for the years 245-468, appended to the \"Chronicle\" in the only almost complete manuscript in our possession. The \"Chronicle\" is printed in Migne, \"P.L.\" vol. 51, 873-890, and vol. 74, 701-750; the \"Fasti Consulares\" are found in P.L., vol. 51, 891-914.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "394464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=394464", "title": "Iron–sulfur world hypothesis", "text": "Iron–sulfur world hypothesis\n\nThe iron–sulfur world hypothesis is a set of proposals for the origin of life and the early evolution of life advanced in a series of articles between 1988 and 1992 by Günter Wächtershäuser, a Munich patent lawyer with a degree in chemistry, who had been encouraged and supported by philosopher Karl R. Popper to publish his ideas. The hypothesis proposes that early life may have formed on the surface of iron sulfide minerals, hence the name. It was developed by retrodiction from extant biochemistry in conjunction with chemical experiments.\n\nWächtershäuser proposes that the earliest form of life, termed \"pioneer organism\", originated in a volcanic hydrothermal flow at high pressure and high (100 °C) temperature. It had a composite structure of a mineral base with catalytic transition metal centers (predominantly iron and nickel, but also perhaps cobalt, manganese, tungsten and zinc). The catalytic centers catalyzed autotrophic carbon fixation pathways generating small molecule (non-polymer) organic compounds from inorganic gases (e.g. carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide). These organic compounds were retained on or in the mineral base as organic ligands of the transition metal centers with a flow retention time in correspondence with their mineral bonding strength thereby defining an autocatalytic \"surface metabolism\". The catalytic transition metal centers became autocatalytic by being accelerated by their organic products turned ligands. The carbon fixation metabolism became autocatalytic by forming a metabolic cycle in the form of a primitive sulfur-dependent version of the reductive citric acid cycle. Accelerated catalysts expanded the metabolism and new metabolic products further accelerated the catalysts. The idea is that once such a primitive autocatalytic metabolism was established, its intrinsically synthetic chemistry began to produce ever more complex organic compounds, ever more complex pathways and ever more complex catalytic centers.\n\nThe water gas shift reaction (CO + HO → CO + H) occurs in volcanic fluids with diverse catalysts or without catalysts. The combination of ferrous sulfide and hydrogen sulfide as reducing agents in conjunction with pyrite formation – FeS + HS → FeS + 2H + 2e (or H instead of 2H + 2e) – has been demonstrated under mild volcanic conditions. This key result has been disputed. Nitrogen fixation has been demonstrated for the isotope N in conjunction with pyrite formation. Ammonia forms from nitrate with FeS/HS as reductant. Methylmercaptan [CH-SH] and carbon oxysulfide [COS] form from CO and FeS/HS, or from CO and H in the presence of NiS.\n\nReaction of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (HS) and methanethiol CHSH in the presence of nickel sulfide and iron sulfide generates the methyl thioester of acetic acid [CH-CO-SCH] and presumably thioacetic acid (CH-CO-SH) as the simplest activated acetic acid analogues of acetyl-CoA. These activated acetic acid derivatives serve as starting materials for subsequent exergonic synthetic steps. They also serve for energy coupling with endergonic reactions, notably the formation of (phospho)anhydride compounds. However, Huber and Wächtershäuser reported a low 0.5% acetate yields based on input of CHSH (Methanethiol) (8 mM) in the presence of 350 mM CO. This is about 500 times and 3700 times the highest CHSH and CO concentrations respectively measured to date in a natural hydrothermal vent fluid.\n\nReaction of nickel hydroxide with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) (in the presence or absence of ferrous hydroxide, hydrogen sulfide or methyl mercaptan) generates nickel cyanide, which reacts with carbon monoxide (CO) to generate pairs of α-hydroxy and α-amino acids: e.g. glycolate/glycine, lactate/alanine, glycerate/serine; as well as pyruvic acid in significant quantities. Pyruvic acid is also formed at high pressure and high temperature from CO, HO, FeS in the presence of nonyl mercaptan.\nReaction of pyruvic acid or other α-keto acids with ammonia in the presence of ferrous hydroxide or in the presence of ferrous sulfide and hydrogen sulfide generates alanine or other α-amino acids. Reaction of α-amino acids in aqueous solution with COS or with CO and HS generates a peptide cycle wherein dipeptides, tripeptides etc. are formed and subsequently degraded via N-terminal hydantoin moieties and N-terminal urea moieties and subsequent cleavage of the N-terminal amino acid unit.\n\nProposed reaction mechanism for reduction of CO on FeS:\nYing et al. (2007) have proved that direct transformation of mackinawite (FeS) to pyrite (FeS) on reaction with HS till 300 °C is not possible without the presence of critical amount of oxidant. In the absence of any oxidant, FeS reacts with HS up to 300 °C to give pyrrhotite.\nFarid et al. have proved experimentally that mackinawite (FeS) has ability to reduce CO to CO at temperature higher than 300 °C. They reported that the surface of FeS is oxidized, which on reaction with HS gives pyrite (FeS). It is expected that CO reacts with HO in the Drobner experiment to give H.\n\nEarly evolution is defined as beginning with the origin of life and ending with the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). According to the iron–sulfur world theory it covers a coevolution of cellular organization (cellularization), the genetic machinery and enzymatization of the metabolism.\n\nCellularization occurs in several stages. It begins with the formation of primitive lipids (e.g. fatty acids or isoprenoid acids) in the surface metabolism. These lipids accumulate on or in the mineral base. This lipophilizes the outer or inner surfaces of the mineral base, which promotes condensation reactions over hydrolytic reactions by lowering the activity of water and protons.\n\nIn the next stage lipid membranes are formed. While still anchored to the mineral base they form a semi-cell bounded partly by the mineral base and partly by the membrane. Further lipid evolution leads to self-supporting lipid membranes and closed cells. The earliest closed cells are pre-cells (\"sensu\" Kandler) because they allow frequent exchange of genetic material (e.g. by fusions). According to Woese, this frequent exchange of genetic material is the cause for the existence of the common stem in the tree of life and for a very rapid early evolution.\n\nWilliam Martin and Michael Russell suggest that the first cellular life forms may have evolved inside alkaline hydrothermal vents at seafloor spreading zones in the deep sea. These structures consist of microscale caverns that are coated by thin membraneous metal sulfide walls. Therefore, these structures would resolve several critical points germane to Wächtershäuser's suggestions at once:\n\n\nThis model locates the \"last universal common ancestor\" (LUCA) within the inorganically formed physical confines of an alkaline hydrothermal vent, rather than assuming the existence of a free-living form of LUCA. The last evolutionary step en route to bona fide free-living cells would be the synthesis of a lipid membrane that finally allows the organisms to leave the microcavern system of the vent. This postulated late acquisition of the biosynthesis of lipids as directed by genetically encoded peptides is consistent with the presence of completely different types of membrane lipids in archaea and bacteria (plus eukaryotes). The kind of vent at the foreground of their suggestion is chemically more similar to the warm (ca. 100 °C) off ridge vents such as Lost City than to the more familiar black smoker type vents (ca. 350 °C).\n\nIn an abiotic world, a thermocline of temperatures and a chemocline in concentration is associated with the pre-biotic synthesis of organic molecules, hotter in proximity to the chemically rich vent, cooler but also less chemically rich at greater distances. The migration of synthesized compounds from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration gives a directionality that provides both source and sink in a self-organizing fashion, enabling a proto-metabolic process by which acetic acid production and its eventual oxidization can be spatially organized.\n\nIn this way many of the individual reactions that are today found in central metabolism could initially have occurred independent of any developing cell membrane. Each vent microcompartment is functionally equivalent to a single cell. Chemical communities having greater structural integrity and resilience to wildly fluctuating conditions are then selected for; their success would lead to local zones of depletion for important precursor chemicals. Progressive incorporation of these precursor components within a cell membrane would gradually increase metabolic complexity within the cell membrane, whilst leading to greater environmental simplicity in the external environment. In principle, this could lead to the development of complex catalytic sets capable of self-maintenance.\n\nRussell adds a significant factor to these ideas, by pointing out that semi-permeable mackinawite (an iron sulfide mineral) and silicate membranes could naturally develop under these conditions and electrochemically link reactions separated in space, if not in time.\n"}

He stayed at Fort Conrad from 1877 to 1885, and established a trading post there in 1880. During that time period he traded with the Pikuni and the Blood and established another trading post at Carroll, Montana on the Missouri River, where he also traded with the Cree.\n\nIn the mid-1880s, Schultz began to spend more time in the Two Medicine and Saint Mary Lakes region of what is now Glacier National Park guiding and outfitting local hunters. In 1885 he sent an article on the St. Mary Lakes to \"Forest and Stream,\" one of his first literary efforts. At the time George Bird Grinnell was the magazine's editor, and he became intrigued with Schultz and the Glacier region. Grinnell solicited Schultz to outfit and guide him on a hunting trip in Glacier in September 1885. Although the trip was not a great success for Grinnell, he did kill a Bighorn ram on a mountain near the Upper Saint Mary Lake with a single shot.\n\nSchultz promptly named the mountain Singleshot Mountain to honor Grinnell's feat. Thus began decades of Schultz naming features in the Glacier regions for clients and friends, and to honor traditional Indian names. Montana State University Library has a digital library of papers and photographs documenting Schultz's time in Montana and Glacier National Park.\n\n\n\nSchultz first visited Arizona in 1906–07, during which time he assisted J. Walter Fewkes in the excavation and restoration of the pueblo ruins at Casa Grande. Due to his success as a writer and explorer, in 1913 he became the first non-resident to build a cabin in the remote White Mountains, near Greer, Arizona. He would use the cabin as a seasonal retreat for decades.\n\nJames Willard Schultz started writing at the age of 21, publishing articles and stories in \"Forest and Stream\" for 15 years. He did not write his first book until 1907 at age 48. The memoir: \"\"My Life as an Indian\" tells the story of his first year living with the Pikuni tribe of Blackfeet Indians east of Glacier. In 1911, he associated himself with publishers Houghton Mifflin; the firm published Schultz's subsequent books for the next 30 years. In 1918 he authored \"Bird Woman\", a novel about Sacajawea. His son, Lone Wolf, provided the illustrations for the novel, and Schultz dedicated the book to him: \"Born near the close of the buffalo days he was, and ever since with his baby hands he began to model statuettes of horses and buffalo and deer with clay from the river banks, his one object has been the world of art.\"\n\nIn all, Schultz wrote and published 37 fiction and non-fiction books dealing with the Blackfeet, Kootenai, and Flathead Indians. His works received critical literary acclaim from the general media as well as academia for his story telling and contributions to ethnology. Sometime after 1902, while living in Southern California, Schultz worked for a while as the literary editor of the \"Los Angeles Times.\"\n\nSchultz's first marriage in 1879 was to \"Natahki\" (meaning \"Fine Shield Woman\"), a Piegan Blackfeet. Natahki was a survivor of the Baker massacre in 1870. They had a son named Hart Merriam Schultz, or Lone Wolf (1882–1965). He was named after Schultz's boyhood friend Clinton Hart Merriam. Natahki died in 1903. Schultz married again, to Jessica 'Jessie' Schultz. (Jessica Louise Donaldson had been a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in Grayling, Montana, and later earned an MA in Anthropology from the University of CA. In 1926-7, as a professor of English at Montana State College, now Montana State University-Bozeman, she helped write and produce a play/pageant entitled 'The Masque of the Absaroka'. It focused on Absaroka (Crow) culture, featuring numerous Native Americans from the Crow Nation. She was a lifelong advocate for Northern Plains Indian culture, and particularly for the welfare of women, assisting with the development of markets for the sale of bead and leather goods.) Jessie made arrangements to publish some of Schultz's works posthumously, such as \"Bear Chief's War Shirt\". She married again after his death, to Henry Graham.\n\nJames Schultz suffered from ill health for most of his last 30 years. Guiding in the rugged Glacier area took its toll physically. He suffered from incapacitating lung and heart infections. In 1931 he injured his spine. In 1942 he fell, breaking his left leg and right arm. In September 1944, a fall at his home in Denver broke his hip and required major surgery to repair. His deteriorating health severely reduced his ability to write and concentrate. After moving to the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming to be close to the Native American tribes he grew up with, he suffered a fatal heart attack and died on June 11, 1947. He wanted to be buried in Montana and was laid to rest on the Blackfeet Reservation near Browning, Montana in the old burial ground of the family of Natahki, his first wife.\n\n\n"}

He attended the grammar school in Kirkwall, and was a student at Edinburgh University. He joined the Speculative Society in 1782.\n\nIn 1785 Laing was admitted advocate, and from 1789 for five years was advocate for poor litigants. During 1790 he was working on the electoral roll in Orkney, in the Whig interest. In 1794, with Adam Gillies, he defended Joseph Gerrald in his sedition case. Sir James Mackintosh, a friend, regarded Laing's delivery as far too fast, and an impediment to his legal career; Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn commented quite positively on his \"hard, peremptory, Celtic manner and accent\".\n\nLaing signed the declaration of the Society of Friends of the People in 1794, and joined the Whig Club. A personal friend of Charles James Fox, he was one of a group of advisers of Fox during the first years of the 19th century on his work of British history, with William Belsham, Samuel Heywood and James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale. He was Member of Parliament for Orkney and Shetland from 1807 to 1812, brought in by the Ministry of All the Talents.\n\nIn 1808 Laing suffered a breakdown, and withdrew from public life. He introduced merino sheep on the islands of Eday and Sanday, purchasing a flock from Tweeddale that had belonged to Sir James Montgomery, 1st Baronet. At the end of his life he tried to introduce the brown hare.\n\nLaing finished Robert Henry's \"History of Great Britain\" with a final volume in 1793, and wrote a \"History of Scotland from the Union of the Crowns to the Union of the Kingdoms\" (1800). In a second edition of the \"History\" in 1804 half the work was devoted to a \"Dissertation on the participation of Mary Queen of Scots in the Murder of Darnley\" and the Casket Letters, hostile to Mary, Queen of Scots. Like George Brodie and Ebenezer Marshal, Laing dwelled on negative feudal and other features of early modern Scottish history. In 1804 also Laing edited \"The Historie and Life of King James the Sext\".\n\nBy modern standards, Laing erred by endorsing a \"Scottish Gothic\" theory of the Picts: that this founding group of the Kingdom of Scotland were not Celts, but had a Teutonic origin. He endorsed the views of John Pinkerton on the matter, as did John Jamieson and James Sibbald.\n\nIn 1805 Laing published in two volumes \"Poems of Ossian, containing the Poetical Works of James MacPherson in Prose and Verse, with Notes and Illustrations\". It contained juvenilia by James Macpherson, fabricator of the Ossian poems, who had died in 1796. It also described how they might be dependent on modern sources that had been borrowed. Laing's criticism was seminal for a theory that Macpherson had used Robert Lowth's study of Hebrew verse to construction his own alleged translations.\nFor Charles James Fox, as explained in a letter to Laing, Macpherson was in the ranks of politically mischievous historians, led by David Hume and his \"A History of England\". Others there were Sir John Dalrymple, 4th Baronet and Thomas Somerville. The underlying issue was Tory and Jacobite revisionism of the Whig historical narrative.\n\nThe \"Ossian debate\", on the poems' authenticity to supposed ancient sources, was coming to a head that year. Via Robert Anderson, Laing was in possession of a confession by Macpherson of the complete fabrication to another party, Sir John Elliott, who had mentioned it to Thomas Percy. On the other hand, the \"Report of the Highland Society\" (1805) upheld the authenticity claims. Percy took the eirenic view that the blame game, at least, should cease.\n\nOn 10 September 1805 Laing married Margaret Dempster Carnegie, daughter of Thomas Carnegie and Mary Gardyne.\n\n\n"}

He travelled to the Kosovo and Metohija region in 1871-1877 and left three volumes of data and maps which testify that Serbs were the majority and Albanians the minority population. His demographic-statistical structure, however, matched an independent census taken by the Austrian authorities at about the same time. Because of his ideas about Greater Serbia and Serbisation, he is also known as Mad Milosh in Bulgaria.

The word comes from the Ancient Greek ᾨδεῖον, \"Ōideion\", literally \"singing place\", or \"building for musical competitions\"; from the verb ἀείδω, \"aeidō\", \"I sing\", which is also the root of ᾠδή, \"ōidē\", \"ode\", and of ἀοιδός, \"aoidos\", \"singer\".\n\nIn a general way the construction of an odeon was similar to that of an ancient Greek theatre, but it was only a quarter of the size and was provided with a roof for acoustic purposes, a characteristic difference. The prototype odeon was the Odeon of Pericles (Odeon of Athens), a mainly wooden building by the southern slope of the Acropolis of Athens. It was described by Plutarch as 'many-seated and many-columned' and may have been square, though excavations have also suggested a different shape, 208 x 62 feet. It was said to be decorated with the masts and spars of ships captured from the Persians. It was rebuilt by king Ariobarzanes I of Cappadocia after destruction by fire in the First Mithridatic War in 87–86 BC.\n\nThe oldest known odeon in Greece was the Skias at Sparta, so called from its resemblance to the top of a parasol, said to have been erected by Theodorus of Samos (600 B.C.); in Athens an odeon near the spring Enneacrunus on the Ilissus was referred to the age of Peisistratus, and appears to have been rebuilt or restored by Lycurgus (c. 330 B.C.). This is probably the building which, according to Aristophanes, was used for judicial purposes, for the distribution of corn, and even for the billeting of soldiers.\nThe most magnificent odeon was the Odeon of Herodes Atticus on the southwest cliff of the Acropolis at Athens. It was built in about 160 A.D. by the wealthy sophist and rhetorician Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, and considerable remains of the odeon still exist. It had accommodation for 4500/5500 persons, and the ceiling was constructed of beautifully carved beams of cedar wood, probably with an open space in the centre to admit the light. It was also profusely decorated with pictures and other works of art. Similar buildings also existed in other parts of Greece; at Corinth, also the gift of Herodes Atticus; at Patrae, where there was a famous statue of Apollo; at Smyrna, Tralles, and other towns in Asia Minor. The first odeon in Rome was built by Domitian (Odeon of Domitian), a second by Trajan.\n"}

According to the Suda she was an Epidaurian; Photius describes her as an Egyptian by birth or descent, which may be reconciled by supposing that she was a native of Epidaurus, and that her family came from Egypt. Photius summarizes the preface to her work, in which we learn that during the thirteen years she had lived with her husband, from whom she was never absent for a single hour, she was constantly at work upon her book, and that she diligently wrote down whatever she heard from her husband and from the many other learned people who frequented their house, as well as whatever she herself read in books. Hence we can account for the statement in the Suda that some people ascribed her work to her husband. The name of her husband is differently stated. In one passage the Suda speaks of her as the daughter of Soteridas and the wife of Socratidas, but in another passage she is described as the wife of Soteridas. \n\nThe principal work of Pamphile was the \"Historical Commentaries\", a history of Greece comprising thirty-three books. Photius gives a general idea of the nature of its contents. The work was not arranged according to subjects or according to any settled plan, but it was more like a commonplace book, in which each piece of information was set down as it fell under the notice of the writer, who stated that she believed this variety would give greater pleasure to the reader. Photius considers the work as one of great use, and supplying important information on many points in history and literature. The estimation in which it was held in antiquity is shown not only by the judgment of Photius, but also by the references to it in the works of Aulus Gellius and Diogenes Laërtius, who appear to have availed themselves of it to a considerable extent. Photius speaks only of eight books but the Suda says that it consisted of thirty-three. The latter must be correct, since we find Gellius quoting the eleventh and twenty-ninth, and Diogenes Laertius the twenty-fifth and thirty-second. Perhaps no more than eight books were extant in the time of Photius. The work is also referred to by Diogenes Laërtius in other passages.\n\nBesides the history already mentioned, the Suda says she also wrote an \"Epitome of Ctesias\" in 3 books; a very large number of epitomes of histories and other books; \"On Disputes\"; \"On Sex\"; and many other works.\n"}

Yale '81) author, who has written pseudohistories about the settlement of North America.\n\nIn his first book, \"The Island of Seven Cities: Where the Chinese Settled When They Discovered America\", Chiasson explains his belief that Chinese voyagers settled in the Cape Dauphin area of Nova Scotia almost a century before the voyages of Christopher Columbus. He suggests that the indigenous Mi'kmaq culture was influenced by these people in the form of possible archaeological remains, customs, costumes, art and even written language.\n\nHis theory has been rejected by mainstream historians. Provincial archaeologists and a geologist have said that some of Chiasson's physical evidence of a Chinese settlement—a road up the side of Cape Dauphin and the stone remains of a wall surrounding the site —were actually built in 1952 by a volunteer fire company fighting a forest fire and again in the 1990s by a gravel company attempting to dig gravel on the cape. Chiasson challenges these statements in his second book, \"Written in the Ruins: Cape Breton Island's Second Pre-Columbian Chinese Settlement.\"\n\nIn December 2010, several years after the reports of the Nova Scotian archeologists, History Television aired a one-hour documentary entitled \"Mysterious Ruins: Cape Breton\". The documentary explored Chiasson's theory and included interviews with an archeologist and a geologist from the area who viewed the site that Chiasson posits was the location of a pre-Columbian Chinese community. Geologist Sandra Barr of Acadia University and archaeologist Steve Davis of St. Mary's University stated that they found no evidence of any human settlement on the site. Acadia University reported that \"their explanations are mostly ignored in the film.\" The documentary also included interviews with several Chinese architectural historians. Dr. Zhu Guangya, Professor of Architectural History at Southeast University, Nanjing stated (translation), \"I believe the site is a ruin from a human settlement. Further study is required to confirm what kind of settlement it is.\" Professor Fang Yong said that \"“I feel that what he has found is not yet enough to prove that it is ruins of a Chinese settlement, but it is possible.”\n\n"}

{"id": "154908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154908", "title": "Regency era", "text": "Regency era\n\nThe Regency in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was a period when King George III was deemed unfit to rule and his son ruled as his proxy as Prince Regent. On the death of George III in 1820, the Prince Regent became George IV. The term Regency (or Regency era) can refer to various stretches of time; some are longer than the decade of the formal Regency which lasted from 1811–1820. The period from 1795 to 1837, which includes the latter part of the reign of George III and the reigns of his sons George IV and William IV, is sometimes regarded as the Regency era, characterised by distinctive trends in British architecture, literature, fashions, politics, and culture. It ended in 1837 when Queen Victoria succeeded William IV.\n\nThe Regency is noted for its elegance and achievements in the fine arts and architecture. This era encompassed a time of great social, political, and economic change. War was waged with Napoleon and on other fronts, affecting commerce both at home and internationally, as well as politics. Despite the bloodshed and warfare, the Regency was also a period of great refinement and cultural achievement, shaping and altering the societal structure of Britain as a whole.\n\nOne of the greatest patrons of the arts and architecture was the Prince Regent himself (the future George IV). Upper-class society flourished in a sort of mini-Renaissance of culture and refinement. As one of the greatest patrons of the arts, the Prince Regent ordered the costly building and refurbishing of the beautiful and exotic Brighton Pavilion, the ornate Carlton House, as well as many other public works and architecture (see John Nash, James Burton, and Decimus Burton). Naturally, this required dipping into the treasury and the Regent, and later, the King's exuberance often outstripped his pocket, at the people's expense.\n\nSociety was also considerably stratified. In many ways, there was a dark side to the beauty and fashion in England at this time. In the dingier, less affluent areas of London, thievery, womanising, gambling, the existence of rookeries, and constant drinking ran rampant. The population boom—the population increased from just under a million in 1801 to one and a quarter million by 1820—created a wild, roiling, volatile, and vibrant scene. According to Robert Southey, the difference between the strata of society was vast indeed:\n\nThe squalor that existed beneath the glamour and gloss of Regency society provided sharp contrast to the Prince Regent's social circle. Poverty was addressed only marginally. The formation of the Regency after the retirement of George III saw the end of a more pious and reserved society, and gave birth of a more frivolous, ostentatious one. This change was influenced by the Regent himself, who was kept entirely removed from the machinations of politics and military exploits. This did nothing to channel his energies in a more positive direction, thereby leaving him with the pursuit of pleasure as his only outlet, as well as his sole form of rebellion against what he saw as disapproval and censure in the form of his father.\n\nDriving these changes was not only money and rebellious pampered youth, but also significant technological advancements. In 1814, \"The Times\" adopted steam printing. By this method it could now print 1,100 sheets every hour, not 200 as before—a fivefold increase in production capability and demand. This development brought about the rise of the wildly popular fashionable novels in which publishers spread the stories, rumours, and flaunting of the rich and aristocratic, not so secretly hinting at the specific identity of these individuals. The gap in the hierarchy of society was so great that those of the upper classes could be viewed by those below as wondrous and fantastical fiction, something entirely out of reach yet tangibly there.\n\n\nThe following is a list of places associated with the Regency era:\n\nFor more names see Newman (1997).\n\n\n\n"}

She worked for some time in \"Salimulla Orphanage\" in 1965 and then joined as secretary to the editor of \"Weekly Begum\" in 1966. In 1967 Selina Parvin joined the \"Weekly Lalana\" as a journalist. She then married a politician. She used to work with various periodicals and used to publish her own pro-liberation periodical \"Shilalipi\" on an irregular basis. She used the weekly's earning to help freedom fighters. In Shailalipi, Selina Parveen used to publish articles by prominent personalities including Prof Munier Chowdhury, journalist Shahidullah Kaiser, Zahir Raihan and ANM Golam Mostafa, all of whom except Raihan became targets of Al-Badr. Zahir Raihan left his house on 30 January 1972 looking for his brother Shahidullah Kaiser, but never returned.\n\nOn 13 December 1971, like other intellectual martyrs, Selina Parvin was seized by members of the paramilitary force Al-Badr. Her son Sumon was only 7 years old. She was brutally killed on 14 December and her dead body was later discovered in the Rayerbazar Boddhobhumy. A lone survivor of the killing testified to the court that being blindfolded, he heard a woman [Selina Parvin] screaming and begging Al-Badr men for her life, appealed to spare her as she had a kid and there was none to take care of him but her. But the brutal killers did not spare her. She was instantly killed by charging bayonet as narrated by the witness. The lone survivor, who managed to loosen the rope with which he was tied and escaped, had described how three prisoners were tortured before being taken out to be shot. Among the victims, Selina Parvin was [later] found with two bayonet wounds, one through the eye and one in the stomach, and two bullet wounds.\n\nOn 3 November 2013, Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin, a Muslim leader based in London, and Ashrafuz Zaman Khan, based in the US, were sentenced in absentia after the court found that they were involved in the abduction and murders of 18 people in December 1971 – nine Dhaka University teachers, six journalists including Selina Parvin, and three physicians.\n\n\n"}

After graduating from Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan with a degree in political science and economics in 1942, he left for mainland China where he worked undercover with the Chinese Communists (1942–1949). For years, he averted the Chinese Communists’ bids for him to join the party. Finally he escaped from Qingdao, China, to Taiwan, just as the Chinese Nationalist Kuomintang soldiers were retreating to Taiwan.\nHaving returned to Taiwan for about a year, he established the Taiwan Independence Armed Corps in 1950 which plotted for the assassination of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. When the Taiwan Independence Armed Corps' stash of weapons were discovered hidden on land owned by Su Beng's grandmother in 1951, Su Beng was forced to go into hiding.\n\nAfter several months on the run, he finally fled to Japan in May 1952 by stowing away in a boat exporting bananas. He served four months of detention for attempting to illegally enter the country, but when the Kuomintang reported him missing and wanted for his involvement in the plot to assassinate Chiang Kai-shek, the Japanese government granted him political asylum. Later on in 1954, Su Beng opened up a noodle shop restaurant () in Ikebukuro, Japan. Su Beng used the restaurant/residence as a base to continue his work with the underground Taiwan independence movement. It was also here that he trained burgeoning independence activists and began writing \"Taiwan’s 400 Year History\". The Japanese version of this book was first published in 1962, the Chinese-language version was published in 1980 and an abridged English version was published in 1986.\n\nIn 1993 Su Beng returned to reside in Taipei, Taiwan. The following year, April 1994, he began the Taiwan Independence Action motorcade, which he conceived as a way to raise the Taiwanese people’s consciousness. The motorcade makes its rounds from Taipei county to Taipei city, every Saturday and Sunday afternoon, delivering messages calling for Taiwan’s independence and the normalization of Taiwan as a country.\n\nLabeled a radical, violent militant and communist, he has been dubbed the “Che Guevara of Taiwan\". Several tall tales exist about Su Beng’s controversial life decisions, one of which includes electing to have a vasectomy when he was in his twenties while working undercover for the Communists in China.\n\nHe first used Su Beng as his pen name for \"Taiwanese’s 400 Year History\" in 1962. In choosing his pen name, he wanted to express his motivation for writing the book. Su Beng believes that once the Taiwanese people understand their unique history, they will be able to know who they are, what they want for themselves and their nation. The two characters which make up his name mean \"history\" and \"clear\", respectively. Taken together, they may be interpreted as “history clearly”, as in “to know history clearly.”\n\n"}

{"id": "364584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=364584", "title": "Translatio studii", "text": "Translatio studii\n\nTranslatio studii (Latin for \"transfer of learning\") is a historiographical concept, originating in the Middle Ages, in which history is viewed as a linear succession of transfers of knowledge or learning from one geographical place and time to another. The concept is closely linked to \"translatio imperii\", which similarly describes the movement of imperial dominance. Both terms are thought to have their origins in the second chapter of the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible (verses 39–40).\n\nIt is a celebrated topos in medieval literature, most notably articulated in the prologue to Chrétien de Troyes's \"Cligès\", composed ca. 1170. There, Chrétien explains that Greece was first the seat of all knowledge, then it came to Rome, and now it has come to France, where, by the grace of God, it shall remain forever more. \n\nIn the Renaissance and later, historians saw the metaphorical light of learning as moving much as the light of the sun did: westward. According to this notion, the first center of learning was Eden, followed by Jerusalem, and Babylon. From there, the light of learning moved westward to Athens, and then west to Rome. After Rome, learning moved west to Paris. From there, enlightenment purportedly moved west to London, though other nations laid claim to the mantle, most notably Russia, which would involve a retrograde motion and rupture in the westerly direction. The metaphor of \"translatio studii\" went out of fashion in the 18th century, but such English Renaissance authors as George Herbert were already predicting that learning would move next to America. \n\nA pessimistic corollary metaphor is the \"translatio stultitiae\". As learning moves west, as the earth turns and light falls ever westward, so night follows and claims the places learning has departed from. The metaphor of the \"translatio stultitiae\" informs Alexander Pope's \"Dunciad,\" and particularly book IV of the \"Greater Dunciad\" of 1741, which opens with the nihilistic invocation:\n\n<poem>\nYet, yet a moment, one dim Ray of Light\nIndulge, dread Chaos, and eternal Night!\" (\"B\" IV 1-2)\n\nSuspend a while your Force inertly strong,\nThen take at once the Poet, and the Song. (ibid. 7-8)\n</poem>\n\nWhile the term \"translatio studii\" literally means in English the translation of studies, there is an implication within the concept that the transmission of learning also carried with it cultural ideals and information. That being said, there is a lot more to \"translatio studii\" than the simple movement of common concepts from the Mediterranean westward.\n\nAccording to Karlheinz Stierle, English is what we might consider the current language of this sort of transmission, but \"what English is today...Latin was in the first centuries after Christ.\" In the way that politics and social issues move circulate around the world very often in English, these same concepts traveled along the developing roads from Greece and Italy to England during Medieval times. As religion spread from Rome to Londinium (or present day Britain) it brought with it other concepts that can still be seen in the Romance languages.\n\nAn interesting example of this is the term \"translatio\" itself. In Ancient times \"translatio\" in Latin meant both \"translation\" and \"transfer\". As time went on, \"translatio\" was designated to only mean transmission and \"traductio\" took on the meaning of what we know as translation. This carried over to the developing Romance languages as time went on. The words \"translation\" in French and \"traslazione\" in Italian mean the displacement of physical objects, and these languages still use other words to mean \"translation\" in the English sense. This varies remarkably from the common meaning used in English, which is solely a linguistic concept rather than a spatial one. In this way, it is clear that historically the significance of \"translatio studii\" concerns the transfer of ideas that hold cultural value.\n\n\"Translatio imperii\" often served as a precedent or coordinate to \"translatio studii\". A transferral of rule assisted a transferral of culture, and vice versa: \"The transferal of power also conveys the phoenix-like reestablishment of culture - as fictionalized in and transmitted by literature - which establishes each new imperial power as the new stronghold of the culturally elite.\"\n\nAs it is concerned with the progress of learning, \"translatio studii\" provides an overview of intellectual heritage. Although it may be considered from various angles (e.g., history, linguistics, and literature) the concept of \"translatio studii\" is fundamentally concerned with texts. \"Reading, translating, commenting, interpreting, rewriting — all are common intertextual activities of the \"translatio studii\".\"\n\n\"Translatio studii\" is based on the assumption that human learning and the potential for human learning originated in Greece from whence it spread westward to Rome and then France.\n\nChrétien de Troyes, a French poet of the late 12th century, writes of \"translatio studii\" in the opening of Cligès:\n\n<poem>\n\"Par les livres que nous avons\"\n\"Les fez des anciiens savons\"\n\"Et del siecle qui fu jadis.\"\n\"Ce nos ont nostre livre apris,\"\n\"Que Grece ot de chevalerie\"\n\"Le premier los et de clergie.\"\n\"Puis vint chevalerie a Rome\"\n\"Et de la clergie la some,\"\n\"Qui or est en France venue.\"\n\"Deus doint qu'ele i soit retenue\"\n\"Et que li leus li abelisse\"\n\"Tant que ja mes de France n'isse.\"\n</poem>\n\nThat is: \"Through the books which we have, we know the deeds of the ancients and of times long passed. Our books have taught us that Greece had the first fame of chivalry and learning. Then came chivalry to Rome, and the sum of learning, which now is come to France. God grant that it remain there, and that it find the place so pleasant that it will never depart from France.\"\n\nAll Roman comedy stems from Greek New Comedy but rewritten in Latin with slight adjustments to local taste and the long, narrow stage of Roman theatre. It keeps the characteristics of conventional situations from domestic life and stock character-masks that were traditional in the Greek model.\n\nRoman theatre in turn influenced theatre of the Renaissance. \"The nine Greek-style tragedies of Seneca (c. 4 B.C.E. -65 C.E.) are especially noteworthy, partly because they were to have a more profound influence on Renaissance tragedians than their Greek originals.\" Conventions commonly associated with Renaissance tragedies, most popularly Shakespeare, that are owed to Seneca, are revenge tragedies, structure of five acts, use of elaborate speeches, soliloquies, and asides, violence and horror performed on stage (as opposed to Greek tragedies in which all such actions occurred off stage), and an interest in the human condition, morality of nobility, and the supernatural, specifically with its human connection.\n\nRome also used the Greek language as a model on which to aid the expansion of their power and secure a language for their empire. According to L. G. Kelly, author of \"The True Interpreter: A History of Translation Theory and Practice in the West\" (1979), \"Western Europe owes its civilization to its translators.\"\n\n\"Cortoisie\" is a synthesis of the superiority of French knighthood and learning. As a new distinction of the French knight, \"cortoisie\" implies not only a new style of communication and mastery of language, but a new style of communicative attitude, especially when regarding women. From \"cortoisie\" comes courtly love, a highly disciplined, self-denying, and respectful social form. Ideally, in this form, the knight honors his lady as something sacred. This new ideal of love called for a new ideal of language, according to Chrétien, and so, translations from old, dead Latin into French, or \"romanz\", began. It is this language that replaces Latin as a new and lasting period of high culture, and, in so doing, becomes the real language or medium of \"translatio studii\".\n\n\n"}

He accused the Government of atheizing the population, being eager to erase traditional values, and has called for Governments' resignation.\n\nOn June 6, 2014, Košić was among the people on Zagreb Airport who have welcomed convicted war criminal Dario Kordić after his release from the Graz-Karlau Prison where he served 25 years sentence for war crimes committed against the Bosniak population during the 1992–94 Bosniak-Croat war. After media in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as some NGOs expressed their dismay of Košić's act, he gave an interview for Sarajevo Catholic Weekly magazine in which he stated that he doesn't believe that Kordić was a war criminal, but was rather a victim of political games regardless of ICTY verdict and all evidences that it was based on.\n\nOn August 24, 2015, President and Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović was presented with a petition for the introduction of a Croatian fascist Ustaše movement salute Za dom spremni to the official use in the Croatian Armed Forces. One of the petition signatories was bishop Košić. President Grabar-Kitarović immediately rejected petition calling it \"frivolous, unacceptable and provocative\". Bishop of Dubrovnik Mate Uzinić stated in an interview for Jutarnji list that salute \"Za dom spremni\" cannot be acceptable to Church.\n\nOn December 21, 2015, Košić wrote a Facebook post referring to the possible coalition agreement between Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Bridge of Independent Lists (MOST) in which he called leader of MOST Božo Petrov \"a sucker and a traitor that throws his party into the jaws of the Communists\", and leader of SDP and at the time incumbent Prime Minister Zoran Milanović \"a thief and a fraud\". After the media reported about his post general public expressed its dissatisfaction which resulted in Košić deleting his Facebook account.\n\nOn August 15, 2016, on the mass celebrated for the \"Assumption of Mary\", Košić, during his homily, urged people to vote on 2016 parliamentary election \"for those who will rid us of yugo-communist heritage and carry out lustration.\" He also refereed to the trial to Josip Perković and Zdravko Mustač who were found guilty by German court in a first-instance verdict for murder of Croat nationalist émigré Stjepan Đureković, stating that \"not only two members of secret service (UDBA) were convicted in Germany but the entire yugo-communist system that killed Croatian patriots abroad as well. It's not clearly stated, so I repeat: communist Yugoslavia was convicted as a terrorist state and its Communist regime as criminal because it killed Croats abroad! So today, those who protected killers and the criminal regime can no longer rule in Croatia.\" However, all of this is false. In addition, he urged God to \"remove and prevent forever in their intentions all of those who are serving diabolical dragon and Herods.\"\n\nOn June 14. 2017, Košić published a furious Facebook post in which he attacked conservative Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković (HDZ) for entering a coalition with center-left Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats (HNS).

As the \"Birthplace of Vermont\", the town is where the Constitution of Vermont was adopted in 1777, thus marking the founding of the Vermont Republic—a sovereign state until 1791 when Vermont joined the United States. Over much of its history, Windsor was home to a variety of manufacturing enterprises. The population was 3,553 at the 2010 census.\n\nOne of the New Hampshire grants, Windsor was chartered as a town on July 6, 1761, by colonial governor Benning Wentworth. It was first settled in August 1764 by Captain Steele Smith and his family from Farmington, Connecticut. In 1777, the signers of the Constitution of the Vermont Republic met at Old Constitution House, a tavern at the time, to declare independence from the British Empire (the Vermont Republic would not become a state until 1791). In 1820, it was the state's largest town, a thriving center for trade and agriculture. In 1835, the first dam was built across Mill Brook to provide water power. Factories made guns, machinery, tinware, furniture and harnesses. The community is named for Windsor, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1846, Robbins and Lawerence received a government contract to manufacture firearms. Using advanced machine tools to produce interchangeable parts, they and their associates established factories in the Connecticut River valley and throughout New England. Two factories, now both closed, sustained the economy of Windsor: Cone Automatic Machine Company and a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant.\nWindsor village began development at the end of the 18th century and achieved importance in Vermont history as the location of the framing of the constitution of Vermont. It is known as the birthplace of Vermont, where the state constitution was signed, and acted as the first capital until 1805 when Montpelier became the official state capital.\n\nCommerce prospered due to the village's location on the banks of the Connecticut River where several smaller streams run into it. The economy improved in the mid-19th century when Windsor became the first town in the state to break ground for the railroad with the construction of a rail depot. Windsor Station connected the town to out-of-state markets. It was after the railroad went through that the area was discovered by tourists.\n\nWindsor's war memorial, the City Center Veterans Memorial, was created by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 19.8 square miles (51.2 km), of which 19.5 square miles (50.6 km) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.5 km) (1.06%) is water. Home to part of Mount Ascutney, Windsor is situated beside the Connecticut River.\n\nThe town is crossed by Interstate 91, U.S. Route 5, Vermont Route 12, Vermont Route 44, and Vermont Route 44A. It is bordered by the town of Weathersfield to the south, West Windsor to the west, and Hartland to the north. To the east, across the Connecticut River, is Cornish, New Hampshire, to which Windsor is connected by the Cornish–Windsor Covered Bridge, one of the longest covered bridges in the world.\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 3,756 people, 1,520 households, and 945 families residing in the town. The population density was 192.1 people per square mile (74.2/km). There were 1,611 housing units at an average density of 82.4 per square mile (31.8/km). The racial makeup of the town was 97.74% White, 0.24% African American, 0.40% Native American, 0.27% Asian, 0.24% from other races, and 1.12% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.06% of the population.\n\nThere were 1,520 households out of which 28.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.3% were couples living together and joined in either marriage or civil union, 12.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.8% were non-families. 31.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 15.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.29 and the average family size was 2.83.\n\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 22.2% under the age of 18, 7.3% from 18 to 24, 26.9% from 25 to 44, 23.0% from 45 to 64, and 20.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.6 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the town was $33,815, and the median income for a family was $43,551. Males had a median income of $29,897 versus $23,313 for females. The per capita income for the town was $17,640. About 6.4% of families and 7.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.9% of those under age 18 and 12.3% of those age 65 or over.\n\nWindsor is served by Windsor School District, Vermont. The district is home to the Windsor Yellow Jackets and serves grades kindergarten to twelfth. The two schools in the district are Windsor State Street School and Windsor High School.\n\nThe Mt.

Warrants, prerogative writs, and subpoenas are common types of writ, but many forms exist and have existed.\n\nIn its earliest form a writ was simply a written order made by the English monarch to a specified person to undertake a specified action; for example, in the feudal era a military summons by the king to one of his tenants-in-chief to appear dressed for battle with retinue at a certain place and time. An early usage survives in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia in a writ of election, which is a written order issued on behalf of the monarch (in Canada, by the Governor General and, in Australia, by the Governor-General for elections for the House of Representatives, or State Governors for State elections) to local officials (High Sheriffs of every county in the historical UK) to hold a general election. Writs were used by the medieval English kings to summon persons to Parliament, (then consisting primarily of the House of Lords) whose advice was considered valuable or who were particularly influential, and who were thereby deemed to have been created \"barons by writ\".\n\nThe writ was a unique development of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, and consisted of a brief administrative order, authenticated (innovatively) by a seal. Written in the vernacular, they generally made a land grant, or conveyed instructions to a local court. In the beginning, writs were the document issued by the King's Chancellor against a landowner whose vassal complained to the King about an injustice, after a first summon by the sheriff to comply had been deemed fruitless. William the Conqueror took over the system unchanged, but was to extend it in two ways: first, writs became mainly framed in Latin, not Anglo-Saxon; second, they covered an increasing range of royal commands and decisions. Writs of instruction continued to develop under his immediate successors, but it was not until Henry the Second that writs became available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice, thus initiating a vast expansion in their role within the common law.\n\nWrits could take two main forms, open (patent) for all to read, and 'letters close' for one or more specified individuals alone.\n\nThe development of writs as a means of commencing a court action was a form of \"off-the-shelf\" justice designed to enable the English law courts to rapidly process lawsuits by allocating each form of complaint into a standard category which could be dealt with by standard procedures. The complainant simply applied to the court for the writ most relevant to his complaint to be sent to the wrongdoer, which ordered him under royal authority to attend a royal court to answer for his actions. The development was part of the establishment of a Court of Common Pleas, for dealing with commonly made complaints by subjects of the crown, for example: \"someone has damaged my property\". The previous system of justice at the royal court of Chancery was tailor-made to suit each case and was thus highly time-consuming. Thus eventually the obtaining of a writ became necessary, in most cases, to have a case heard in one of the Royal Courts, such as the King's Bench or Common Pleas. Some franchise courts, especially in the Counties Palatine, had their own system of writs which often reflected or anticipated the common law writs. The writ was \"served\" on (delivered in person to) the wrongdoer and acted as a command that he should appear at a specified time and date before the court specified in the writ, or it might command some other act on the part of the recipient.\n\nWhere a plaintiff wished to have a case heard by a local court, or by an Eyre if one happened to be visiting the County, there would be no need to obtain a writ. Actions in local courts could usually be started by an informal complaint. However, if a plaintiff wished to avail himself of Royal — and by implication superior — justice in one of the King's courts, then he would need a writ, a command of the King, to enable him to do this. Initially for common law, recourse to the King's courts was unusual, and something for which a plaintiff would have to pay. For most Royal Courts, the writ would usually have been purchased from the Chancery, although the court of the Exchequer, being in essence another government department, was able to issue its own writs.\n\nWhile originally writs were exceptional, or at least non-routine devices, Maitland suggests that by the time of King Henry II (1154-1189), the use of writs had become a regular part of the system of royal justice in England.\n\nAt first, new writs were drafted to fit each new situation, although in practice the clerks of the Chancery would use wording from previously issued writs, with suitable adjustments, often taken from reference books containing collections of forms of writ, much as in modern times lawyers frequently use fixed precedents or boilerplate, rather than re-inventing the wording of a new legal document. The problem with this approach was that a plaintiff's rights and available forms of action at his disposal, would be defined, and in most cases limited, by the limited variety of writs available to him. Thus the power to create new writs was akin to the power to create new rights, a form of extra-parliamentary legislation. Moreover, a writ, if one could be found fitting the plaintiff's case, provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the local court, often controlled by a lesser noble, and instead have it heard by the King's judges. The nobility thus saw the creation of new writs as an erosion of their influence.\n\nOver time, opposition to the creation of new writs by the Chancery increased. For example, in 1256 a court was asked to quash a writ as \"novel, unheard of, and against reason\" (Abbot of Lilleshall v Harcourt (1256) 96 SS xxix 44). Ultimately in 1258 the King was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford, which among other things, prohibited the creation of new forms of writ without the sanction of the King's council. New writs were created after that time only by the express sanction of Parliament and the forms of writ remained essentially static, each writ defining a particular form of action. It was the role and expertise of a solicitor to select on his client's behalf the appropriate writ for the proposed legal action. These were purchased from the court by payment of a fee. A barrister would then be hired by the solicitor to speak for his client in court.\n\nWith the abolition of the Forms of Action in 1832 and 1833, a profusion of writs was no longer needed, and one uniform writ came into use. After 1852 the need to state the name of the form of action was also abolished. In 1875 the form of writ was altered so that it conformed more to the subpoena used in the Chancery. A writ was a summons from the Crown, to the parties to the action, with on its back the substance of the action set out, together with a 'prayer' requesting a remedy from the court (for example damages). In 1980 the need for writs to be written in the name of the Crown was ended. From that time, a writ simply required the parties to appear..\n\nWrits applied to claims that were to be heard in one of the courts which eventually formed part of the High Court of Justice. The procedure in a County Court, which was established by statute, was to issue a 'summons'.\n\nIn 1999 the Woolf Reforms unified most of the procedure of the Supreme Court and the County Court in civil matters. These reforms brought in the Civil Procedure Rules. Under these almost all civil actions, other than those connected with insolvency, are now commenced by the completion of a 'Claim Form' as opposed to the obtaining of a 'Writ', 'Originating Application', or 'Summons' (see Rules 7 and 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules).\n\nIn some Westminster systems, for example Canada and some other parliamentary systems, the phrase 'dropping the writ' refers colloquially to a dissolution of parliament and the beginning of an election campaign to form a new one. This phrase derives from the fact that to hold an election in such a system a writ of election must be issued on behalf of the monarch ordering the High Sheriffs of each county to set in motion the procedure for elections.\n\nEarly law of the United States inherited the traditional English writ system, in the sense of a rigid set of forms of relief that the law courts were authorized to grant. The All Writs Act authorizes United States federal courts to \"issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\" However, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, adopted in 1938 to govern civil procedure in the United States district courts, provide that there is only one form of action in civil cases, and explicitly abolish certain writs by name. Relief formerly available by a writ is now normally available by a lawsuit (civil action) or a motion in a pending civil action. Nonetheless, a few writs have escaped abolition and remain in current use in the U.S. federal courts:\n\n\nThe situation in the courts of the various U.S. states varies from state to state but is often similar to that in the federal courts. Some states continue to use writ procedures, such as quo warranto, that have been abolished as a procedural matter in federal courts.\n\nIn an attempt to purge Latin from the language of the law, California law has for many years used the term \"writ of mandate\" in place of \"writ of mandamus\", and \"writ of review\" in place of \"writ of certiorari\".\n\nThe \"prerogative\" writs are a subset of the class of writs, those that are to be heard ahead of any other cases on a court's docket except other such writs. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are \"habeas corpus\", \"quo warranto\", \"prohibito\", \"mandamus\", \"procedendo\", and \"certiorari\".\n\nThe due process for \"petitions for\" such writs is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of nonauthority, so that the official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something, failing which the court has no discretion but to decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. In this they differ from a motion in a civil process in which the burden of proof is on the movant, and in which there can be a question of standing.\n\n\nUnder the Indian legal system, jurisdiction to issue 'prerogative writs' is given to the Supreme Court, and to the High Courts of Judicature of all Indian states. Parts of the law relating to writs are set forth in the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court, the highest in the country, may issue writs under Article 32 of the Constitution for enforcement of Fundamental Rights and under Articles 139 for enforcement of rights other than Fundamental Rights, while High Courts, the superior courts of the States, may issue writs under Articles 226. The Constitution broadly provides for five kinds of \"prerogative\" writs: \"habeas corpus\", \"certiorari\", \"mandamus\", \"quo warranto\" and prohibition. \n\n\n"}

Wu was one of the most important historians in the development of modern historical scholarship in China during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn the 1940s he was a leading member of the China Democratic League, a non-aligned political organization during most of the Chinese civil war which eventually threw its weight behind the Communist Party of China. After 1949, he served as the Vice Mayor of Beijing.\n\nIn November 1965, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, he came under attack for a play he wrote about an upright Ming dynasty official called \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\", which was later branded as an anti-Mao allegory. His political downfall also resulted in the purge of Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen. He died in prison in 1969.\n\nWu Han was born in Yiwu, Zhejiang in 1909. With support from the Wu clan organization and with the money from selling his mother's jewelry, he attended university preparatory schools in Hangzhou and then in Shanghai, where he was inspired by the lectures of Hu Shi. He entered Tsinghua University in 1931 and came under the influence of Tsiang Tingfu. Since he was responsible for the support of his brother and sister, he was unable to go abroad for study. Wu stayed at Tsinghua as a teaching assistant but began to publish important articles on Ming dynasty history using critical techniques to resolve old controversies and raise new questions.\n\nWhen the war with Japan broke out in 1937, Wu joined National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming. While there, he wrote a full scale biography of the founder of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, published in 1943, expanded and revised in 1947. He became a leading intellectual in the democratic movement of the 1940s, as well as a widely published essayist. Through his part in the China Democratic League he was enlisted in the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.\n\nWhen the new United Front was founded, as a member of the Democratic League, Wu was asked to take the position of Vice Mayor of Beijing in charge of education and cultural affairs for the 6 county municipal area that became a model for municipalities across the PRC. In the 1950s, Wu represented China abroad on cultural tours and popularized his research at home, using figures from history as models and allegorical figures. He became a member of the Chinese Communist Party secretly in the mid-50s; this was not known by his colleagues or by Party members except at the very highest level. It was only revealed in the Cultural Revolution by the Red Guard accusations after they found his files.\n\nWu wrote a series of articles and a play originally published in 1951 and revised many times, on the life of Hai Rui, a Ming dynasty official. In 1960 Wu's Beijing opera, \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\" became a great success. In November 1965 Yao Wenyuan, later one of the Gang of Four, fired one of the opening shots of the Cultural Revolution when he attacked Wu and his play on the grounds that Hai Rui was metaphorically equated with Peng Dehuai, and therefore Mao himself with the un-approachable Ming emperor. Wu admitted ideological mistakes but denied that his motives were counter-revolutionary.\n\nOver the next months the controversy grew, and Wu was finally jailed. Although there were reports that Wu Han committed suicide while in prison in 1969, fellow prisoners later reported that he was beaten in prison about a year before he died. It is also thought his tuberculosis may have recurred so it cannot be established how he died.\n\n\n"}
