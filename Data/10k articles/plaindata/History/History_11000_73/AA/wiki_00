According with an article published in the \"Genealogical Journal\" (1971), this institution was the first genealogical association in Latin America.\n\nIt was established on 12 January 1920 by Salvador Mota-Velasco y Abad (1855–1923); it was erected in memory of the first Historian of the former Kingdom of Nueva Galicia (New Galicia) in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, Matías Angel de la Mota Padilla (1688–1766), author of \"Historia de la Conquista del Reino de la Nueva Galicia\" (1741); among its members, the very same Salvador Mota-Velasco y Abad was a direct descendant of the after mentioned author. \nThis institution was privately funded and led by enthusiasts of the Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences whose main purpose was to promote the creation of a study about the history of the municipality of Unión de Tula, Jalisco, with a genealogical and heraldic research of the four founding families of that place, which were the Topete, the Villaseñor, the Lazcano and the Arriola families (the name of the place was originated through their initials: \"T\" \"V\" \"L\" \"A\"). With the passing of time, the Academia's objectives went beyond the original idea, promoting any kind of Genealogical and Heraldic studies, then, more enthusiasts became members of this institution. They gathered monthly and produced some interesting works, like those published by journalist Alberto Santoscoy or by historian José R. Benítez; unfortunately, some of those papers are still unpublished.\n\nThe founding members were five: Salvador Mota-Velasco y Abad (1855–1923), José Ignacio Dávila Garibi (1888–1981), Jorge Verea y Vallarta (1877–1958), Enrique Eduardo López Maldonado († 1938), and Alberto Santoscoy (1857–1906).\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nFounders Academicians in 1920\n\n\nAfter most of its original members died, the institution became less active; then, Jorge Verea y Vallarta's nephew, Ricardo Lancaster-Jones y Verea, reorganized it between 1950–53, it was formally re-established with an act dated on 8 May 1953. After Lancaster-Jones y Verea's death in 1983, the institution became extinct.\n\nBoard of Directors:\n\nHonorary Academicians:\n\n\nCounsultant Academicians:\n\nPatrons:\n\nCompanies:\nIndividuals:\n\nThe \"Academia de Genealogía y Heráldica Mota-Padilla\" published three volumes of \"Anuario\" (1943, 1955, 1957) and a \"Lista de Miembros y Estatutos\" (1955).\n\nThis institution contributed with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and with the Academia Mexicana de Genealogía y Heráldica, during the microfilming process of the complete and well preserved Archdiocese of Guadalajara's records (1953–71). Nowadays, a copy of these microfilms are located in the Archivo General de la Nación in Mexico City, and are available for public consultation under the guidelines and regulations of the same institution.\n"}
{"id": "926219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=926219", "title": "Ancient Greek literature", "text": "Ancient Greek literature\n\nAncient Greek literature refers to literature written in the Ancient Greek language from the earliest texts until the time of the Byzantine Empire. The earliest surviving works of ancient Greek literature, dating back to the early Archaic period, are the two epic poems \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey\", set in the Mycenaean era. These two epics, along with the Homeric Hymns and the two poems of Hesiod, \"Theogony\" and \"Works and Days\", comprised the major foundations of the Greek literary tradition that would continue into the Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods.\n\nThe lyric poets Sappho, Alcaeus, and Pindar were highly influential during the early development of the Greek poetic tradition. Aeschylus is the earliest Greek tragic playwright for whom any plays have survived complete. Sophocles is famous for his tragedies about Oedipus, particularly \"Oedipus the King\" and \"Antigone\". Euripides is known for his plays which often pushed the boundaries of the tragic genre. The comedic playwright Aristophanes wrote in the genre of Old Comedy, while the later playwright Menander was an early pioneer of New Comedy. The historians Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Thucydides, who both lived during the fifth century BC, wrote accounts of events that happened shortly before and during their own lifetimes. The philosopher Plato wrote dialogues, usually centered around his teacher Socrates, dealing with various philosophical subjects, whereas his student Aristotle wrote numerous treatises, which later became highly influential.\n\nImportant later writers included Apollonius of Rhodes, who wrote \"The Argonautica\", an epic poem about the voyage of the Argonauts; Archimedes, who wrote groundbreaking mathematical treatises; and Plutarch, who wrote mainly biographies and essays. The second-century AD writer Lucian of Samosata was a Hellenized Syrian, who wrote primarily works of satire. Ancient Greek literature has had a profound impact on later Greek literature and also western literature at large. In particular, many ancient Roman authors drew inspiration from their Greek predecessors. Ever since the Renaissance, European authors in general, including Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, John Milton, and James Joyce, have all drawn heavily on classical themes and motifs.\n\nThis period of Greek literature stretches from Homer until the fourth century BC and the rise of Alexander the Great. The earliest known Greek writings are Mycenaean, written in the Linear B syllabary on clay tablets. These documents contain prosaic records largely concerned with trade (lists, inventories, receipts, etc.); no real literature has been discovered. Michael Ventris and John Chadwick, the original decipherers of Linear B, state that literature almost certainly existed in Mycenaean Greece, but it was either not written down or, if it was, it was on parchment or wooden tablets, which did not survive the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces in the twelfth century BC.\n\nGreek literature was divided in well-defined literary genres, each one having a compulsory formal structure, about both dialect and metrics. The first division was between prose and poetry. Within poetry there were three super-genres: epic, lyric and drama. The common European terminology about literary genres is directly derived from the ancient Greek terminology. Lyric and drama were further divided into more genres: lyric in four (elegiac, iambic, monodic lyric and choral lyric); drama in three (tragedy, comedy and pastoral drama). Prose literature can largely be said to begin with Herodotus. Over time, several genres of prose literature developed, but the distinctions between them were frequently blurred.\n\nAt the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of Homer, the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\". The figure of Homer is shrouded in mystery. Although the works as they now stand are credited to him, it is certain that their roots reach far back before his time (see Homeric Question). \"The Iliad\" is a narrative of a single episode spanning over the course of a ten-day-period from near the end of the ten years of the Trojan War. It centers on the person of Achilles, who embodied the Greek heroic ideal.\n\"The Odyssey\" is an account of the adventures of Odysseus, one of the warriors at Troy. After ten years fighting the war, he spends another ten years sailing back home to his wife and family. Penelope was considered the ideal female, Homer depicted her as the ideal female based on her commitment, modesty, purity, and respect during her marriage with Odysseus. During his ten-year voyage, he loses all of his comrades and ships and makes his way home to Ithaca disguised as a beggar. Both of these works were based on ancient legends. The stories are told in language that is simple, and direct. The Homeric dialect was an archaic language based on Ionic dialect mixed with some element of Aeolic dialect and Attic dialect, the latter due to the Athenian edition of the 6th century BC. The epic verse was the hexameter.\n\nThe other great poet of the preclassical period was Hesiod. Unlike Homer, Hesiod refers to himself in his poetry. Nonetheless, nothing is known about him from any external source. He was a native of Boeotia in central Greece, and is thought to have lived and worked around 700 BC. Hesiod's two extant poems are \"Works and Days\" and \"Theogony\". \"Works and Days\" is a faithful depiction of the poverty-stricken country life he knew so well, and it sets forth principles and rules for farmers. \"Theogony\" is a systematic account of creation and of the gods. It vividly describes the ages of mankind, beginning with a long-past Golden Age.\n\nThe writings of Homer and Hesiod were held in extremely high regard throughout antiquity and were viewed by many ancient authors as the foundational texts behind ancient Greek religion; Homer told the story of a heroic past, which Hesiod bracketed with a creation narrative and an account of the practical realities of contemporary daily life.\n\nLyric poetry received its name from the fact that it was originally sung by individuals or a chorus accompanied by the instrument called the lyre. Despite the name, however, the lyric poetry in this general meaning was divided in four genres, two of which were not accompanied by cithara, but by flute. These two latter genres were elegiac poetry and iambic poetry. Both were written in the Ionic dialect. Elegiac poems were written in elegiac couplets and iambic poems were written in iambic trimeter. The first of the lyric poets was probably Archilochus of Paros, circa 700 BC, the most important iambic poet. Only fragments remain of his work, as is the case with most of the poets. The few remnants suggest that he was an embittered adventurer who led a very turbulent life.\n\nMany lyric poems were written in the Aeolic Dialect. Lyric poems often employed highly varied poetic meters. The most famous of all lyric poets were the so-called \"Nine Lyric Poets.\" Of all the lyric poets, Sappho of Lesbos (c. 630-c. 570 BC) was by far the most widely revered. In antiquity, her poems were regarded with the same degree of respect as the poems of Homer. Only one of her poems, \"Ode to Aphrodite,\" has survived to the present day in its original, completed form. In addition to Sappho, her contemporary Alcaeus of Lesbos was also notable for monodic lyric poetry. The poetry written by Alcman was considered beautiful, even though he wrote exclusively in the Doric dialect, which was normally considered unpleasant to hear. The later poet Pindar of Thebes was renowned for his choral lyric poetry.\n\nAll surviving works of Greek drama were composed by playwrights from Athens and are written exclusively in the Attic dialect. Choral performances were a common tradition in all Greek city-states. The Athenians credited a man named Thespis with having invented drama by introducing the first actor, whose primary purpose was to interact with the leader of the chorus. Later playwrights expanded the number of actors to three, allowing for greater freedom in storytelling.\n\nIn the age that followed the Greco-Persian Wars, the awakened national spirit of Athens was expressed in hundreds of tragedies based on heroic and legendary themes of the past. The tragic plays grew out of simple choral songs and dialogues performed at festivals of the god Dionysus. In the classical period, performances included three tragedies and one pastoral drama, depicting four different episodes of the same myth. Wealthy citizens were chosen to bear the expense of costuming and training the chorus as a public and religious duty. Attendance at the festival performances was regarded as an act of worship. Performances were held in the great open-air theater of Dionysus in Athens. The poets competed for the prizes offered for the best plays.\n\nAll fully surviving Greek tragedies are conventionally attributed to Aeschylus, Sophocles or Euripides. The authorship of \"Prometheus Bound\", which is traditionally attributed to Aeschylus, and \"Rhesus\", which is traditionally attributed to Euripides, are still questioned. There are seven surviving tragedies attributed to Aeschylus. Three of these plays, \"Agamemnon\", \"The Libation-Bearers\", and \"The Eumenides\", form a trilogy known as \"The Oresteia\". One of these plays, \"Prometheus Bound\", however, may actually be the work of Aeschylus's son Euphorion.\n\nSeven works of Sophocles have survived, the most acclaimed of which are the three Theban plays, which center around the story of Oedipus and his offspring. The Theban Trilogy consists of \"Oedipus the King\", \"Oedipus at Colonus\", and \"Antigone\". Although the plays are often called a \"trilogy,\" they were actually written many years apart. \"Antigone\", the last of the three plays sequentially, was actually first to be written, having been composed in 441 BC, towards the beginning of Sophocles's career. \"Oedipus the King\", the most famous of the three, was written around 429 BC at the midpoint of Sophocles's career. \"Oedipus at Colonus\", the second of the three plays chronologically, was actually Sophocles's last play and was performed in 401 BC, after Sophocles's death.\n\nThere are nineteen surviving plays attributed to Euripides. The most well-known of these plays are \"Medea\", \"Hippolytus\", and \"Bacchae\". \"Rhesus\" is sometimes thought to have been written by Euripides' son, or to have been a posthumous reproduction of a play by Euripides. Euripides pushed the limits of the tragic genre and many of the elements in his plays were more typical of comedy than tragedy. His play \"Alcestis\", for instance, has often been categorized as a \"problem play\" or perhaps even as a work of tragicomedy rather than a true tragedy due to its comedic elements and the fact that it has a happy ending.\n\nLike tragedy, comedy arose from a ritual in honor of Dionysus, but in this case the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and insult. At Athens, the comedies became an official part of the festival celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions. As with the tragedians, few works still remain of the great comedic writers. The only complete surviving works of classical comedy are eleven plays written by the playwright Aristophanes. These are a treasure trove of comic presentation. He poked fun at everyone and every institution. In \"The Birds\", he ridicules Athenian democracy. In \"The Clouds\", he attacks the philosopher Socrates. In \"Lysistrata\", he denounces war. Aristophanes has been praised highly for his dramatic skill and artistry. John Lemprière's \"Bibliotheca Classica\" describes him as, quite simply, \"the greatest comic dramatist in world literature: by his side Molière seems dull and Shakespeare clownish.\" Of all Aristophanes's plays, however, the one that has received the most lasting recognition is \"The Frogs\", which simultaneously satirizes and immortalizes the two giants of Athenian tragedy: Aeschylus and Euripides. When it was performed for the first time at the Lenaia Festival in 405 BC, just one year after the death of Euripides, the Athenians awarded it first prize. It was the only Greek play that was ever given an encore performance, which took place two months later at the City Dionysia. Even today, \"The Frogs\" still appeals to modern audiences. A commercially successful modern musical adaptation of it was performed on Broadway in 2004.\n\nThe third dramatic genre was the satyr play. Although the genre was popular, only one complete example of a satyr play has survived: \"Cyclops\" by Euripides. Large portions of a second satyr play, \"Ichneutae\" by Sophocles, have been recovered from the site of Oxyrhynchus in Egypt among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri.\n\nTwo notable historians who lived during the Classical Era were Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Thucydides. Herodotus is commonly called \"The Father of History.\" His book \"The Histories\" is among the oldest works of prose literature in existence. Thucydides's book \"History of the Peloponnesian War\" greatly influenced later writers and historians, including the author of the book of Acts of the Apostles and the Byzantine Era historian Procopius of Caesarea.\n\nA third historian of ancient Greece, Xenophon of Athens, began his \"Hellenica\" where Thucydides ended his work about 411 BC and carried his history to 362 BC. Xenophon's most famous work is his book \"The Anabasis\", a detailed, first-hand account of his participation in a Greek mercenary army that tried to help the Persian Cyrus expel his brother from the throne. Xenophon also wrote three works in praise of the philosopher Socrates: \"The Apology of Socrates to the Jury\", \"The Symposium\", and \"Memorabilia\". Although both Xenophon and Plato knew Socrates, their accounts are very different. Many comparisons have been made between the account of the military historian and the account of the poet-philosopher.\n\nMany important and influential philosophers lived during the fifth and fourth centuries BC. Among the earliest Greek philosophers were the three so-called \"Milesian philosophers\": Thales of Miletus, Anaximander, and Anaximenes. Of these philosophers' writings, however, only one fragment from Anaximander preserved by Simplicius of Cilicia has survived.\n\nVery little is known for certain about the life of the philosopher Pythagoras of Samos and no writings by him have survived to the present day, but an impressive corpus of poetic writings written by his pupil Empedocles of Acragas has survived, making Empedocles one of the most widely attested Pre-Socratic philosophers. A large number of fragments written by the philosophers Heraclitus of Ephesus and Democritus of Abdera have also survived.\n\nOf all the classical philosophers, however, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are generally considered the most important and influential. Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal of him is accurate. Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato's early socratic dialogues. Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato's portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato's own opinions who has very little to do with the historical figure of the same name. The debate over the extent to which Plato's portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates's ideas is known as the Socratic problem.\nPlato expressed his ideas through dialogues, that is, written works purporting to describe conversations between different individuals. Some of the best-known of these include: \"The Apology of Socrates\", a purported record of the speech Socrates gave at his trial; \"Phaedo\", a description of the last conversation between Socrates and his disciples before his execution; \"The Symposium\", a dialogue over the nature of love; and \"The Republic\", widely regarded as Plato's most important work, a long dialogue describing the ideal government.\n\nAristotle of Stagira is widely considered to be one of the most important and influential philosophical thinkers of all time. The first sentence of his \"Metaphysics\" reads: \"All men by nature desire to know.\" He has, therefore, been called the \"Father of those who know.\" His medieval disciple Thomas Aquinas referred to him simply as \"the Philosopher\". Aristotle was a student at Plato's Academy, and like his teacher, he wrote dialogues, or conversations. However, none of these exist today. The body of writings that has come down to the present probably represents lectures that he delivered at his own school in Athens, the Lyceum. Even from these books, the enormous range of his interests is evident: He explored matters other than those that are today considered philosophical; the extant treatises cover logic, the physical and biological sciences, ethics, politics, and constitutional government. Among Aristotle's most notable works are \"Politics\", \"Nicomachean Ethics\", \"Poetics\", \"On the Soul\", and \"Rhetoric\".\n\nBy 338 BC all of the Greek city-states except Sparta had been united by Philip II of Macedon. Philip's son Alexander the Great extended his father's conquests greatly. Athens lost its preeminent status as the leader of Greek culture, and it was replaced temporarily by Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nThe city of Alexandria in northern Egypt became, from the 3rd century BC, the outstanding center of Greek culture. It also soon attracted a large Jewish population, making it the largest center for Jewish scholarship in the ancient world. In addition, it later became a major focal point for the development of Christian thought. The Musaeum, or Shrine to the Muses, which included the library and school, was founded by Ptolemy I. The institution was from the beginning intended as a great international school and library. The library, eventually containing more than a half million volumes, was mostly in Greek. It was intended to serve as a repository for every work of classical Greek literature that could be found.\n\nThe genre of bucolic poetry was first developed by the poet Theocritus. The Roman Virgil later wrote his \"Eclogues\" in this genre. Callimachus, a scholar at the Library of Alexandria, composed the \"Aetia\" (\"Causes\"), a long poem written in four volumes of elegiac couplets describing the legendary origins of obscure customs, festivals, and names, which he probably wrote in several stages over the course of many years in the third century BC. The \"Aetia\" was lost during the Middle Ages, but, over the course of the twentieth century, much of it was recovered due to new discoveries of ancient papyri. Scholars initially denigrated it as \"second-rate\", showing great learning, but lacking true \"art\". Over the course of the century, scholarly appraisal of it greatly improved, with many scholars now seeing it in a much more positive light. Callimachus also wrote short poems for special occasions and at least one short epic, the \"Ibis\", which was directed against his former pupil Apollonius. He also compiled a prose treatise entitled the \"Pinakes\", in which he catalogued all the major works held in the Library of Alexandria.\n\nThe Alexandrian poet Apollonius of Rhodes is best known for his epic poem the \"Argonautica\", which narrates the adventures of Jason and his shipmates the Argonauts on their quest to retrieve the Golden Fleece from the land of Colchis. The poet Aratus wrote the hexameter poem \"Phaenomena\", a poetic rendition of Eudoxus of Cnidus's treatise on the stars written in the fourth century BC.\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period, the Old Comedy of the Classical Era was replaced by New Comedy. The most notable writer of New Comedy was the Athenian playwright Menander. None of Menander's plays have survived to the present day in their complete form, but one play, \"The Bad-Tempered Man\", has survived to the present day in a near-complete form. Large portions of another play entitled \"The Girl from Samos\" have also survived.\n\nThe historian Timaeus was born in Sicily but spent most of his life in Athens. His \"History\", though lost, is significant because of its influence on Polybius. In 38 books it covered the history of Sicily and Italy to the year 264 BC, which is where Polybius begins his work. Timaeus also wrote the \"Olympionikai\", a valuable chronological study of the Olympic Games.\n\nEratosthenes of Alexandria ( 276 BC –  195/194 BC), wrote on astronomy and geography, but his work is known mainly from later summaries. He is credited with being the first person to measure the Earth's circumference. Much that was written by the mathematicians Euclid and Archimedes has been preserved. Euclid is known for his \"Elements\", much of which was drawn from his predecessor Eudoxus of Cnidus. The \"Elements\" is a treatise on geometry, and it has exerted a continuing influence on mathematics. From Archimedes several treatises have come down to the present. Among them are \"Measurement of the Circle\", in which he worked out the value of pi; \"The Method of Mechanical Theorems\", on his work in mechanics; \"The Sand Reckoner\"; and \"On Floating Bodies\". A manuscript of his works is currently being studied.\n\nVery little has survived of prose fiction from the Hellenistic Era. \"The Milesiaka\" by Aristides of Miletos was probably written during the second century BC. \"The Milesiaka\" itself has not survived to the present day in its complete form, but various references to it have survived. The book established a whole new genre of so-called \"Milesian tales,\" of which \"The Golden Ass\" by the later Roman writer Apuleius is a prime example.\n\nThe ancient Greek novels \"Chaereas and Callirhoe\" by Chariton and \"Metiochus and Parthenope\" were probably both written during the late first century BC or early first century AD, during the latter part of the Hellenistic Era. The discovery of several fragments of Lollianos's \"Phoenician Tale\" reveal the existence of a genre of ancient Greek picaresque novel.\n\nWhile the transition from city-state to empire affected philosophy a great deal, shifting the emphasis from political theory to personal ethics, Greek letters continued to flourish both under the Successors (especially the Ptolemies) and under Roman rule. Romans of literary or rhetorical inclination looked to Greek models, and Greek literature of all types continued to be read and produced both by native speakers of Greek and later by Roman authors as well. A notable characteristic of this period was the expansion of literary criticism as a genre, particularly as exemplified by Demetrius, Pseudo-Longinus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. The New Testament, written by various authors in varying qualities of Koine Greek also hails from this period, the most important works being the Gospels and the Epistles of Saint Paul.\n\nThe poet Quintus of Smyrna, who probably lived during the late fourth century AD, wrote \"Posthomerica\", an epic poem narrating the story of the fall of Troy, beginning where \"The Iliad\" left off.\n\nThe poet Nonnus of Panopolis wrote \"The Dionysiaca\", the longest surviving epic poem from antiquity. He also wrote a poetic paraphrase of The Gospel of John. Nonnus probably lived sometime during the late fourth century AD or early fifth century AD.\n\nThe historian Polybius was born about 200 BC. He was brought to Rome as a hostage in 168. In Rome he became a friend of the general Scipio Aemilianus. He probably accompanied the general to Spain and North Africa in the wars against Carthage. He was with Scipio at the destruction of Carthage in 146.\n\nDiodorus Siculus was a Greek historian who lived in the 1st century BC, around the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus. He wrote a universal history, \"Bibliotheca Historica\", in 40 books. Of these, the first five and the 11th through the 20th remain. The first two parts covered history through the early Hellenistic era. The third part takes the story to the beginning of Caesar's wars in Gaul, now France. Dionysius of Halicarnassus lived late in the first century BC. His history of Rome from its origins to the First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) is written from a Roman point of view, but it is carefully researched. He also wrote a number of other treatises, including \"On Imitation\", \"Commentaries on the Ancient Orators\", and \"On the Arrangement of Words\".\n\nThe historians Appian of Alexandria and Arrian of Nicomedia both lived in the second century AD. Appian wrote on Rome and its conquests, while Arrian is remembered for his work on the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Arrian served in the Roman army. His book therefore concentrates heavily on the military aspects of Alexander's life. Arrian also wrote a philosophical treatise, the \"Diatribai\", based on the teachings of his mentor Epictetus.\n\nBest known of the late Greek historians to modern readers is Plutarch of Chaeronea, who died about AD 119. His \"Parallel Lives\" of great Greek and Roman leaders has been read by every generation since the work was first published. His other surviving work is the \"Moralia\", a collection of essays on ethical, religious, political, physical, and literary topics.\n\nDuring later times, so-called \"commonplace books,\" usually describing historical anecdotes, became quite popular. Surviving examples of this popular genre include works such as Aulus Gellius's \"Attic Nights\", Athenaeus of Naucratis's \"Deipnosophistae\", and Claudius Aelianus's \"De Natura Animalium\" and \"Varia Historia\".\n\nThe physician Galen lived during the 2nd century AD. He was a careful student of anatomy, and his works exerted a powerful influence on medicine for the next 1,400 years. Strabo, who died about AD 23, was a geographer and historian. His \"Historical Sketches\" in 47 volumes has nearly all been lost. His \"Geographical Sketches\" remain as the only existing ancient book covering the whole range of people and countries known to the Greeks and Romans through the time of Augustus. Pausanias, who lived in the 2nd century AD, was also a geographer. His \"Description of Greece\" is a travel guide describing the geography and mythic history of Greece during the second century. The book takes the form of a tour of Greece, starting in Athens and ending in Naupactus.\n\nThe scientist of the Roman period who had the greatest influence on later generations was undoubtedly the astronomer Ptolemy. He lived during the 2nd century AD, though little is known of his life. His masterpiece, originally entitled \"The Mathematical Collection\", has come to the present under the title \"Almagest\", as it was translated by Arab astronomers with that title. It was Ptolemy who devised a detailed description of an Earth-centered universe, a notion that dominated astronomical thinking for more than 1,300 years. The Ptolemaic view of the universe endured until Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and other early modern astronomers replaced it with heliocentrism.\n\nEpictetus ( 55 AD – 135 AD) was associated with the moral philosophy of the Stoics. His teachings were collected by his pupil Arrian in the \"Discourses\" and the \"Encheiridion\" (Manual of Study).\n\nDiogenes Laertius, who lived in the third century AD, wrote \"Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers\", a voluminous collection of biographies of nearly every Greek philosopher who ever lived. Unfortunately, Diogenes Laertius often fails to cite his sources and many modern historians consider his testimony unreliable. Nonetheless, in spite of this, he remains the only available source on the lives of many early Greek philosophers. His book is not entirely without merit; it does preserve a tremendous wealth of information that otherwise would not have been preserved. His biography of Epicurus, for instance, is of particularly high quality and contains three lengthy letters attributed to Epicurus himself, at least two of which are generally agreed to be authentic.\n\nAnother major philosopher of his period was Plotinus. He transformed Plato's philosophy into a school called Neoplatonism. His \"Enneads\" had a wide-ranging influence on European thought until at least the seventeenth century. Plotinus's philosophy mainly revolved around the concepts of \"nous\", \"psyche\", and the \"One.\"\n\nAfter the rise of Christianity, many of the most important philosophers were Christians. The second-century Christian apologist Justin Martyr, who wrote exclusively in Greek, made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy, especially Platonism. Origen of Alexandria, the founder of Christian theology, also made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy and was even able to hold his own against the pagan philosopher Celsus in his apologetic treatise \"Contra Celsum\".\n\nThe Roman Period was the time when the majority of extant works of Greek prose fiction were composed. The ancient Greek novels \"Leucippe and Clitophon\" by Achilles Tatius and \"Daphnis and Chloe\" by Longus were both probably written during the early second century AD. \"Daphnis and Chloe\", by far the most famous of the five surviving ancient Greek romance novels, is a nostalgic tale of two young lovers growing up in an idealized pastoral environment on the Greek island of Lesbos. \"The Wonders Beyond Thule\" by Antonius Diogenes may have also been written during the early second century AD, although scholars are unsure of its exact date. \"The Wonders Beyond Thule\" has not survived in its complete form, but a very lengthy summary of it written by Photios I of Constantinople has survived. \"The Ephesian Tale\" by Xenophon of Ephesus was probably written during the late second century AD.\n\nThe satirist Lucian of Samosata lived during the late second century AD. Lucian's works were incredibly popular during antiquity. Over eighty different writings attributed to Lucian have survived to the present day. Almost all of Lucian's works are written in the heavily Atticized dialect of ancient Greek language prevalent among the well-educated at the time. His book \"The Syrian Goddess\", however, was written in a faux-Ionic dialect, deliberately imitating the dialect and style of Herodotus. Lucian's most famous work is the novel \"A True Story\", which some authors have described as the earliest surviving work of science fiction. His dialogue \"The Lover of Lies\" contains several of the earliest known ghost stories as well as the earliest known version of \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice.\" His letter \"The Passing of Peregrinus\", a ruthless satire against Christians, contains one of the earliest pagan appraisals of early Christianity.\n\n\"The Aethiopica\" by Heliodorus of Emesa was probably written during the third century AD. It tells the story of a young Ethiopian princess named Chariclea, who is estranged from her family and goes on many misadventures across the known world. Of all the ancient Greek novels, the one that attained the greatest level of popularity was the \"Alexander Romance\", a fictionalized account of the exploits of Alexander the Great written in the third century AD. Eighty versions of it have survived in twenty-four different languages, attesting that, during the Middle Ages, the novel was nearly as popular as the Bible. Versions of the \"Alexander Romance\" were so commonplace in the fourteenth century that Geoffrey Chaucer wrote that \"...every wight that hath discrecioun / Hath herd somwhat or al of [Alexander's] fortune.\"\n\nAncient Greek literature has had an enormous impact on western literature as a whole. Ancient Roman authors adopted various styles and motifs from ancient Greek literature. These ideas were later, in turn, adopted by other western European writers and literary critics. Ancient Greek literature especially influenced later Greek literature. For instance, the Greek novels influenced the later work \"Hero and Leander\", written by Musaeus Grammaticus. Ancient Roman writers were acutely aware of the ancient Greek literary legacy and many deliberately emulated the style and formula of Greek classics in their own works. The Roman poet Vergil, for instance, modeled his epic poem \"The Aeneid\" on \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey\".\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, ancient Greek literature was largely forgotten in Western Europe. The medieval writer Roger Bacon wrote that \"there are not four men in Latin Christendom who are acquainted with the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic grammars.\" It was not until the Renaissance that Greek writings were rediscovered by western European scholars. During the Renaissance, Greek began to be taught in western European colleges and universities for the first time, which resulted in western European scholars rediscovering the literature of ancient Greece. The \"Textus Receptus\", the first New Testament printed in the original Greek, was published in 1512 by the Italian humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus. Erasmus also published Latin translations of classical Greek texts, including a Latin translation of Hesiod's \"Works and Days\".\n\nThe influence of classical Greek literature on modern literature is also evident. Numerous figures from classical literature and mythology appear throughout \"The Divine Comedy\" by Dante Alighieri. Plutarch's \"Lives\" were a major influence on William Shakespeare and served as the main source behind his tragedies \"Julius Caesar\", \"Antony and Cleopatra\", and \"Coriolanus\". Shakespeare's comedies \"A Comedy of Errors\" and \"The Twelfth Night\" drew heavily on themes from Graeco-Roman New Comedy. Meanwhile, Shakespeare's tragedy \"Timon of Athens\" was inspired by a story written by Lucian and his comedy \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\" was based off an adaptation of the ancient Greek novel \"Apollonius of Tyre\" found in John Gower's \"Confessio Amantis\".\n\nJohn Milton's epic poem \"Paradise Lost\" is written using a similar style to the two Homeric epics. It also makes frequent allusions to figures from classical literature and mythology, using them as symbols to convey a Christian message. Lucian's \"A True Story\" was part of the inspiration for Jonathan Swift's novel \"Gulliver's Travels\". \"Bulfinch's Mythology\", a book on Greek mythology published in 1867 and aimed at a popular audience, was described by Carl J. Richard as \"one of the most popular books ever published in the United States\".\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's play \"Pygmalion\" is a modern, rationalized retelling of the ancient Greek legend of Pygmalion. James Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\", heralded by critics as one of the greatest works of modern literature, is a retelling of Homer's \"Odyssey\" set in modern-day Dublin. The mid-twentieth-century British author Mary Renault wrote a number of critically acclaimed novels inspired by ancient Greek literature and mythology, including \"The Last of the Wine\" and \"The King Must Die\".\n\nEven in works that do not consciously draw on Graeco-Roman literature, authors often employ concepts and themes originating in ancient Greece. The ideas expressed in Aristotle's \"Poetics\", in particular, have influenced generations of Western writers and literary critics. A Latin translation of an Arabic version of the \"Poetics\" by Averroes was available during the Middle Ages. Common Greek literary terms still used today include: \"catharsis\", \"ethos\", \"anagnorisis\", \"hamartia\", \"hubris\", \"mimesis\", \"mythos\", \"nemesis\", and \"peripeteia\".\n\n\n"}

Tipperary, and Margaret Casement (d. 1953), of Cronroe, Co. Wicklow. She had three sisters and a brother; two of her sisters died young. Through her mother Otway-Ruthven was related to Roger Casement.\n\nOtway-Ruthven studied history in Trinity College, Dublin, was elected a Scholar of the College in 1928, and graduated BA in 1931. She continued her studies at Girton College, University of Cambridge, writing \"The king's secretary and the signet office in the XV century\" for which she was awarded a PhD. \n\nShe returned to Trinity College in 1938 as lecturer in medieval and modern history and in economic history; she succeeded Constantia Maxwell as Lecky professor in 1951. From 1965 she headed a new department of medieval history which, under her direction, became one of the finest departments in the College. In 1968 TCD made her one of its first female Fellows. The position of female academics in Trinity College when Otway-Ruthven was appointed in 1938, had barely improved since the first appointment of a woman, Constantia Maxwell, in 1909. Otway-Ruthven resented this discrimination: 'We were paid less than men doing the equivalent work, and I have been told that this was right since … we were less useful to the College.' \n\nA former student, James Lydon (1928-2013), who later became a colleague of Otway-Ruthven at Trinity, said of her that ‘her contribution to Irish history ... will never be surpassed.’ Lydon also noted her kindness to students who were in difficulties. One of her most distinguished students was F.S.L. Lyons, who later became provost of Trinity.\n\nOtway-Ruthven's area of particular interest was Ireland in the twelfth century and the impact on the country of the arrival of the Anglo-Normans. She published extensively and her monograph \"A history of medieval Ireland\", was a landmark in Irish historiography. She translated the Cambridgeshire Domesday Book in 1941 and the \"Liber Primus Kilkenniensis\"., she published Dowdall deeds with Charles McNeill in 1960 and brought a calendar of the Talbot de Malahide papers close to completion.\n\nOtway-Ruthven also engaged in a project to reconstruct, from transcripts in London, Irish chancery rolls which had been lost in the destruction of the Public Record Office of Ireland in the Irish War of Independence in 1922. Her work in this regard was acknowledged when the project was brought to completion in the 21st century. \nShe was appointed to the Irish Manuscripts Commission in 1943 and was elected FRHS in 1941 and MRIA in 1951. She was a member of the International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions.\n\nOtway-Ruthven was an amateur botanist, raising rare plants in her garden at Rathgar, and was also proficient in needlework.\n\nShortly after her retirement in 1980 she was incapacitated by a severe stroke which left her paralysed and near-speechless. The rest of her life was spent in a nursing home, where she died on 18 March 1989. Her papers are deposited in Trinity College, and the College has a portrait of her by the artist Derek Hill. The College is also home to the Castle-Otway Harp, an eighteenth-century Irish musical instrument which, although it has no known association with the family, was in Castle Otway from the mid nineteenth century.\n"}

Soon, he was sketching scenes of cowboy and western life and drawing political cartoons for newspapers. After United States Army service in World War I, he traveled to New York City, where he studied at Grand Central School of Art under Harvey Dunn. By 1940, he had created more than 160 cover paintings for Western pulp magazines. During the summers, Mitchell continued to paint in the American Southwest and often invited his mentor Dunn to come to Colorado to sketch the landscapes.\nIn 1944, Mitchell returned to Trinidad and launched the first art class at Trinidad State Junior College, where he remained on the faculty until 1958. In 1959, he designed the official \"Rush to the Rockies\" emblem commemorating the 1859 Colorado gold rush centered about Cripple Creek in the Rocky Mountains. He also sought to preserve and restore historic Trinidad buildings, including the Baca House, the home of the founder of Trinidad, the Bloom Mansion, and the Pioneer Museum. He was the curator for the Trinidad Historic District until 1975. \nIn 1972, he was named an honorary member of Cowboy Artists of America. In 1973, he was one of twenty-four academics entered into the National Academy of Western Artists. In 1974, he received the Honorary Trustees Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, as \"the man who has done the most for Southwest history\" through his paintings.\nFour years after his death, the A.R. Mitchell Museum of Western Art was opened in 1981 on the Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway at 150 East Main Street in downtown Trinidad at the location of the former Jamieson Department Store. The museum displays some 250 of his major works, which are similar in theme to the better known western artists Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell. The lifelong bachelor called his paintings \"my children.\"\n\nAmong his displayed works, none of which are dated in the museum collection, are \"When Nights Are Long\", \"Lazy Day\", \"Shadows at the Longhorn\", \"Homeward Bound\", \"Morning Friskies\", \"The Get-Away\", \"Bulldogger\", \"Holdup at First National Bank\", and \"Driving off Rustlers\".\nIn 1975, Mitchell retired to Denver, where he died two years later and is interred. Mitchell's sister, Ethel \"Tot\" Erickson (1892–1982), laid the groundwork for opening the museum in his honor, completing the task only a year before her own passing.\n\nMitchell once summed up his legacy, accordingly: \"You look over the back trail, and you see the fine friends you've made, and you see you've managed to make a living doing something you really loved; so how could anyone ask for more?\"\n"}

In 1885, her father retired from Haileybury and moved to the new charitable settlement of Toynbee Hall in London's East End, with the family residing at St Katharine Docks – a significant change from Barbara's rural upbringing but which she took in her stride. She was then sent to the progressive new boarding school of St Leonards in Scotland, which was pioneering academic education for girls.\n\nIn 1892, she won a scholarship to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, following her sister Dorothy. She was the first woman student at Oxford to use a bicycle and was also head of the college's boat club, captain of the hockey team and a tennis champion. She further distinguished herself by being the first woman to take a double-first in Classical Moderations and Greats – a set of examinations renowned for their difficulty. This feat inspired a limerick:\n<poem>\n</poem>\n\nAt Oxford, she became a fellow of Lady Margaret Hall. There, she had met John Lawrence Hammond and they married in 1901 after he had established a career in political journalism, becoming the editor of the Liberal weekly review, \"The Speaker\", in 1899. They lived in Battersea and were both active in campaigning against the Boer War. She was also active in the Women's Industrial Council until ovarian tuberculosis forced her to retire and also prevented her from having children.\n\nThe couple moved to Hampstead Heath in 1905 for the sake of her health, which was now delicate. In 1907, John became secretary of the Civil Service Commission and this position gave him sufficient time to write books too. They worked together on these with Barbara focussing on the research while John concentrated on the writing. While she had done better academically at Oxford, she told her husband John that \"she hated using her brains\". He wrote that her strength was \"putting great masses of fact & detail in order, seizing their significance & seeing how they should be set out.\" Their first work together was a study of the effects of enclosure and the Industrial Revolution upon the working classes. When taken to the publishers, Longmans, this was found to be too long and so Barbara restructured the work into separate volumes. The first of these was \"The Village Labourer\" which was published in 1911. This was well-received and had an immediate political impact, informing Liberal policy produced by the Land Enquiry Committee of David Lloyd George – a driver of the Liberal welfare reforms.\n\nIn 1912, they moved again to a farmhouse called Oatfield in the rustic village of Piccotts End which was to be their home for most of their lives. Barbara would work here while tending the large garden and collection of animals. Their friend, the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, recounted her spartan, therapeutic lifestyle which emphasised fresh air – open windows, long walks, riding and outdoor sleeping. She would make occasional trips to the Public Record Office for research while John spent more time in London for his job. During the Second World War, he worked at the \"Manchester Guardian\" and so they moved to Manchester for the duration but then returned to Piccotts End in 1945. John died there in 1949 and Barbara died later in 1961.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32528871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32528871", "title": "Biscay Campaign", "text": "Biscay Campaign\n\nThe Biscay Campaign () was an offensive of the Spanish Civil War which lasted from 31 March to 1 July 1937. 50,000 men of the Eusko Gudarostea met 65,000 men of the insurgent forces. After heavy combats the Nationalist forces with a crushing material superiority managed to occupy the city of Bilbao and the Biscay province.\n\nBy late October 1936, all Gipuzkoa was occupied by the rightist rebel forces. The western front settled at the foot of Intxorta (Elgeta). However, Mola did not hide his plans to use air force against Basque territory loyal to the Republic. Despite Basque nationalist attempts at guaranteeing no shelling on civilians, Spanish Nationalist aircraft raided Bilbao on September 25 and 26, an indiscriminate attack on its starving population that spread a blaze of outrage across the city.\n\nOblivious to foreseeable consequences, the Nationalists resumed ferocious air strikes against the city on 4 January 1937, prompting yet another outcry of indignation and an assault on the prison-ships where right-wingers were being held. It resulted in a death toll of 224.\n\nOn 22 March 1937, Franco decided to halt his offensive against Madrid and start an offensive against the northern Republican held zone. The northern zone was politically divided and isolated from the central Republican zone. Furthermore, there was most of Spanish iron and coal and the chemical plants of Biscay. The Nationalists decided to start the occupation of the northern Republican zone with the conquest of the Biscay province.\n\nThe Nationalists had the Emilio Mola's Army of the North (55,000 men). The Nationalist attack started with the Navarrese Division, led by the General José Solchaga. This division had four brigades led by the Colonels Garcia Valiño, Alonso Vega, Cayuela and Latorre (18,000 men) and the Black Arrow division (8,000 men with Italian officers). This force was established between Vergara and Villareal, on the border of the Biscay province. The Nationalist had also 200 guns, 120 aircraft, the battleship \"España\", the cruisers \"Canarias\" and \"Almirante Cervera\" and the destroyer \"Velasco\".\n\nOpposing them, the Republicans had General Francisco Llano de la Encomienda's Army of the North, theoretically numbered 150,000, but there were no unity between the Basque Nationalists, the Asturians and the Santaderinos. The Basque Army in Biscay had 30,000 men (most of them Basque Nationalists and also Asturians). The Republicans also had 140 guns, 25-30 aircraft, two destroyers and three submarines.\n\nThe Nationalist offensive started on 31 March and Mola threatened to bomb the Basque cities and industries:\"I have decided to terminate rapidly the war in the north: those not guilty of assassinations and who surrender their arms will have their lives and property spared. But, if submission is not immediate, I will raze all Vizcaya to the ground, beginning with the industries of war.\". The same day the Aviazione Legionaria bombed the town of Durango, there were 250 civilian deaths. On 1 April the Colonel Camilo Alonso Vega captured the mountains of Maroto, Albertia and Jarindo, and the Navarrase troops attacked the town of Ochandiano and encircled the Basque troops in it. The Navarrese occupied the town on 4 April, after heavy combats and aerial bombardment. The Basque troops left 400 deaths and 600 prisoners. Then Mola, decided to stop the advance due bad weather.\n\nOn 6 April the Nationalist government in Burgos announced the blockade of the Basque ports. The British government said that the blockade was effective and warned British ships not to go to Bilbao. Nevertheless, British merchants broke the blockade and entered in Basque ports. On 20 April the Nationalists continued their offensive after a heavy artillery bombardment. The Basque troops led by Major Pablo Belderraín tried to resist but the 1st Navarrese Brigade led by the colonel Garcia Valiño broke the front and occupied Elgeta. The same day the Legion Condor bombed Guernica.\n\nThe Basques retreated to the Iron Belt line and the \"Legion Condor\" bombed the roads and woods with incendiary bombs. Then, the \"Lendakari\", Jósé Antonio Aguirre, decided to assume the command of the Basque troops, due the incompetence of Llano de la Encomienda. On 30 April the Italians occupied Bermeo, but the Republican battleship \"Jaime I\", was damaged by a mine. As the Nationalist troops approached Bilbao, the autonomous Basque government made an international plea to save the children of war flocking to the city. More than 20,000 were evacuated to 'temporary' safety on chartered boats, most of them to permanent exile.\n\nThe Republican government tried to send fighters to the Basque country across France, but the French government returned the aircraft after confiscate its machine guns. The commander of the \"Spanish Republican Air Force\", Hidalgo de Cisneros, decided to send 50 fighters and bombers to the Basque Country, across the Nationalist held territory, 45 reached Bilbao.\n\nMeantime, the bad weather stopped again the Nationalist offensive, a new shipment of weapons (55 antiaircraft guns, 30 cannons and two squadrons of \"Chatos\"), reached Bilbao, and the General Gámir was sent to Biscay in order to organize the defense of Bilbao and to replace Llano de la Encomienda. The Republican government launched two offensives in Segovia and Huesca to halt the Nationalist offensive against Bilbao but both failed.\n\nMola died on 3 June and was replaced by General Davila. On 11 June the Nationalist troops reached the Iron Belt and on 12 June after a heavy aerial and artillery bombing (150 guns and 70 bombers) the Nationalist troops assaulted it. A Basque deserter, the Major Goicoechea gave to the Nationalist the plans of the Iron Belt.\n\nThe Nationalist attacked in the Mount Urcullu and broke the Basque lines. On 14 June the Basque government left Bilbao, on 18 June the Basque troops was ordered to leave the city and by 19 June the Nationalist conquered the city. 200 thousand people were evacuated westwards to Santander, on trawlers first and cars, horse carts, lorries and on foot later. They were bombed over by Condor Legion aircraft along the way.\n\nThe Basque army temporarily stabilized the front on a line that runs south from the village Ontón on the coast. Biscay had the only factory in Spain capable of the manufacture of artillery shells and half of the Spanish production of explosives. Virtually all manufacturing and shipbuilding industry remained untarnished, since the Basque nationalist authorities' opposed its destruction.\n\nThe arrival of the rebels to the city was followed by ransacking, murder, and pseudo-trials. 8,000 thousand were imprisoned for their Basque nationalist leanings, and many of them sent to forced 'work battalions'. In December, executions by fire-squad and garrote vil started to be conducted. The number of executions during and after the fall of Biscay is estimated at 916. The Basque autonomy was abolished and the Basque tongue forbidden.\n\n"}

He was originally from Jaén. Chronicler Antonio de Remesal recorded that de Vico studied theology in Úbeda and finished his studies in the San Esteban convent in Salamanca.\n\nDomingo de Vico set out from Spain on 9 July 1544 with a group led by Bartolomé de las Casas in an effort to enforce the New Laws that had been issued in 1542 to protect the indigenous inhabitants of the Spanish colonies from overexploitation by the \"encomenderos\". De Vico was the prior of Cobán from 1554 until his death in 1555. He was charged with the evangelisation of the Lakandon and Acala Ch'ol in the unconquered area that was then referred to by the Spanish as the \"Tierra de Guerra\" (\"Land of War\"), and also as Verapaz.\n\nIn 1544, Francisco Marroquín, bishop of Guatemala, charged Domingo de Vico with producing a treatise upon Indian idolatry. The work contained instructions to Dominicans upon how to use indigenous beliefs in their sermons in Chiapas and Guatemala. It was entitled \"Tratado de ídolos\" (\"Treatment of Idols\"). His best known written work is his \"Theologia Indorum\", of which eleven copies survive, divided between the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris (5 copies) and the Firestone Library of Princeton University, New Jersey (6 copies). Among the copies in France are translations made in the Tzutuhil, K'iche' and Kaqchikel languages. During his short time in Guatemala before his death, he is believed to have compiled the \"Vocabulario de la lengua cakchiquel\" (\"Vocabulary of the Kaqchikel language\"). De Vico learnt the Ch’ol language and was able to preach to the Lakandon and Acala in their own language.\n\nDe Vico wrote some religious poems in Kaqchikel upon the Acts of the Apostles and the Passion of Christ. A work entitled \"Los Proverbios de Salomón, las Epístolas y los Evangelios de todo el año, en lengua mexicana\" (\"The Proverbs of Solomon, the Epistles and Gospels for the whole year, in the Mexican tongue\") was prevented from being published by the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nIn 1555, Domingo de Vico and his companion Andrés López were killed by the Acala and their Lakandon allies. De Vico, who had established a small missionary church in San Marcos (in what is now Alta Verapaz, Guatemala), had offended the local Maya ruler by repeatedly scolding him for taking several wives. The indigenous leader shot the friar through the throat with an arrow; the angry natives then sacrificed him by cutting open his chest and extracting his heart. His corpse was then decapitated; the natives carried off his head as a trophy, which was never recovered by the Spanish. In retaliation, the Spanish rounded up 260 Ch'ol in 1559, hanged 80 and branded the rest as slaves.\n\n"}

English playwrights combined the influence of the Medieval theatre with the Renaissance's rediscovery of the Roman dramatists, Seneca, for tragedy, and Plautus and Terence, for comedy. Italy was an important source for Renaissance ideas in England and the linguist and lexicographer John Florio (1553–1625), whose father was Italian, a royal language tutor at the Court of James I, who had furthermore brought much of the Italian language and culture to England. He also translated the works of Montaigne from French into English.\n\nTwo of the most important Elizabethan prose writers were John Lyly (1553 or 1554 – 1606) and Thomas Nashe (November 1567 – c. 1601). Lyly is an English writer, poet, dramatist, playwright, and politician, best known for his books \"Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit\" (1578) and \"Euphues and His England\" (1580). Lyly's mannered literary style, originating in his first books, is known as \"euphuism\". Lyly must also be considered and remembered as a primary influence on the plays of William Shakespeare, and in particular the romantic comedies. Lyly's play \"Love's Metamorphosis\" is a large influence on \"Love's Labour's Lost\", and \"Gallathea\" is a possible source for other plays. Nash is considered the greatest of the English Elizabethan pamphleteers. He was a playwright, poet, and satirist, who is best known for his novel \"The Unfortunate Traveller\".\n\nGeorge Puttenham (1529–1590) was a 16th-century English writer and literary critic. He is generally considered to be the author of the influential handbook on poetry and rhetoric, \"The Arte of English Poesie\" (1589).\n\nItalian literature was an important influence on the poetry of Thomas Wyatt (1503–42), one of the earliest English Renaissance poets. He was responsible for many innovations in English poetry, and alongside Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (1516/1517–47) introduced the sonnet from Italy into England in the early 16th century. Wyatt's professed object was to experiment with the English tongue, to civilise it, to raise its powers to those of its neighbours. While a significant amount of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by the Italian poet Petrarch, he also wrote sonnets of his own. Wyatt took subject matter from Petrarch's sonnets, but his rhyme schemes make a significant departure. Petrarch's sonnets consist of an \"octave\", rhyming \"abba abba\", followed, after a turn (volta) in the sense, by a sestet with various rhyme schemes, however his poems never ended in a rhyming couplet. Wyatt employs the Petrarchan octave, but his most common sestet scheme is \"cddc ee\". This marks the beginnings of English sonnet with 3 quatrains and a closing couplet.\n\nIn the later 16th century, English poetry was characterised by elaboration of language and extensive allusion to classical myths. The most important poets of this era include Edmund Spenser and Sir Philip Sidney. Elizabeth herself, a product of Renaissance humanism, produced occasional poems such as \"On Monsieur’s Departure\" and \"The Doubt of Future Foes\".\n\nEdmund Spenser (c. 1552–99) was one of the most important poets of this period, author of \"The Faerie Queene\" (1590 and 1596), an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I. Another major figure, Sir Philip Sidney (1554–86), was an English poet, courtier and soldier, and is remembered as one of the most prominent figures of the Elizabethan Age. His works include \"Astrophel and Stella\", \"The Defence of Poetry\", and \"The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia\". Poems intended to be set to music as songs, such as by Thomas Campion (1567–1620), became popular as printed literature was disseminated more widely in households. \"See English Madrigal School\".\n\nShakespeare also popularized the English sonnet, which made significant changes to Petrarch's model. Poems intended to be set to music as songs, such as those by Thomas Campion, became popular as printed literature was disseminated more widely in households. \"See English Madrigal School\".\n\nWhile the canon of Renaissance English poetry of the 16th has always been in some form of flux, it is only towards the late 20th century that concerted efforts were made to challenge the canon. Questions that once did not even have to be made, such as where to put the limitations of periods, what geographical areas to include, what genres to include, what writers and what kinds of writers to include, are now central.\n\nThe central figures of the Elizabethan canon are Edmund Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney, Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare, and Ben Jonson. There have been few attempts to change this long established list because the cultural importance of these five is so great that even re-evaluations on grounds of literary merit has not dared to dislodge them from the curriculum. Edmund Spenser had a significant influences on 17th-century poetry. Spenser was the primary English influence on John Milton.\n\nIn the 18th century interest in Elizabethan poetry was rekindled through the scholarship of Thomas Warton and others.\n\nThe Lake Poets and other Romantics, at the beginning of the 19th century, were well-read in Renaissance poetry. However, the canon of Renaissance poetry was formed only in the Victorian period, with anthologies like Palgrave's \"Golden Treasury\". A fairly representative idea of the \"Victorian canon\" is also given by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch's \"Oxford Book of English Verse\" (1919). The poems from this period are largely songs and apart from the major names, one sees the two pioneers Sir Thomas Wyatt and the Earl of Surrey, and a scattering of poems by other writers of the period. However, the authors of many poems are anonymous. Some poems, such as Thomas Sackville's Induction to the \"Mirror for Magistrates\", were highly regarded (and therefore \"in the canon\") but they were omitted from the anthology as non-lyric.\n\nIn the 20th century T. S. Eliot's many essays on Elizabethan subjects were mainly concerned with Elizabethan theatre, but he also attempted to bring back long-forgotten poets to general attention, like Sir John Davies, whose cause he championed in an article in The Times Literary Supplement in 1926 (republished in On Poetry and Poets, 1957).\n\nThe American critic Yvor Winters suggested in 1939, an alternative canon of Elizabethan poetry. In this canon he excludes the famous representatives of the Petrarchan school of poetry, represented by Sir Philip Sidney and Edmund Spenser, and instead turns his eye to a Native or Plain Style \"anti-Petrarchan\" movement, which he claims has been overlooked and undervalued. The most underrated member of this movement he deems to have been George Gascoigne (1525–1577), who \"deserves to be ranked...among the six or seven greatest lyric poets of the century, and perhaps higher\". Other members were Sir Walter Raleigh (1552–1618), Thomas Nashe (1567–1601), Barnabe Googe (1540–1594), and George Turberville (1540–1610).\n\nCharacteristic of this movement is that a poem has \n\nBoth Eliot and Winters were very much in favour of the established canon. Towards the end of the 20th century, however, the established canon was criticized, especially by those who wished to expand it to include, for example, more women writers.\n\nThe Italian Renaissance had rediscovered the ancient Greek and Roman theatre. This revival of interest was instrumental in the development of the new drama, which was then beginning to make apart from the old mystery and miracle plays of the Middle Ages. The Italians were inspired by Seneca (a major tragic playwright and philosopher, the tutor of Nero) and by Plautus (whose comic clichés, especially that of the boasting soldier, had a powerful influence during the Renaissance and thereafter). However, the Italian tragedies embraced a principle contrary to Seneca's ethics: showing blood and violence on the stage. In Seneca's plays such scenes were only acted by the characters. \nDuring the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and then James I (1603–25), in the late 16th and early 17th century, a London-centred culture, that was both courtly and popular, produced great poetry and drama. The English playwrights were intrigued by Italian model: a conspicuous community of Italian actors had settled in London. The linguist and lexicographer John Florio (1553–1625), whose father was Italian, was a royal language tutor at the Court of James I, and a possible friend and influence on William Shakespeare, had brought much of the Italian language and culture to England. He was also the translator of Montaigne into English. The earliest Elizabethan plays include \"Gorboduc\" (1561), by Sackville and Norton, and Thomas Kyd's (1558–94) revenge tragedy \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (1592). Highly popular and influential in its time, \"The Spanish Tragedy\" established a new genre in English literature theatre, the revenge play or revenge tragedy. Its plot contains several violent murders and includes as one of its characters a personification of Revenge. \"The Spanish Tragedy\" was often referred to, or parodied, in works written by other Elizabethan playwrights, including William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and Christopher Marlowe. Many elements of \"The Spanish Tragedy,\" such as the play-within-a-play used to trap a murderer and a ghost intent on vengeance, appear in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet.\" Thomas Kyd is frequently proposed as the author of the hypothetical \"Ur-Hamlet\" that may have been one of Shakespeare's primary sources for \"Hamlet\".\n\nJane Lumley (1537–1578) was the first person to translate Euripides into English. Her translation of \"Iphigeneia at Aulis\" is the first known dramatic work by a woman in English.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564–1616) stands out in this period both as a poet and playwright. Shakespeare wrote plays in a variety of genres, including histories, tragedies, comedies and the late romances, or tragicomedies. His early classical and Italianate comedies, like \"A Comedy of Errors\", containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"Much Ado About Nothing\", \"As You Like It\", and \"Twelfth Night\". After the lyrical \"Richard II\", written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, \"Henry IV, parts 1\" and \"2\", and \"Henry V\". This period begins and ends with two tragedies: \"Romeo and Juliet\", and \"Julius Caesar\", based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's \"Parallel Lives\", which introduced a new kind of drama.\n\nShakespeare's career continued into the Jacobean period, and in the early 17th century Shakespeare wrote the so-called \"problem plays\", \"Measure for Measure\", \"Troilus and Cressida\", and \"All's Well That Ends Well\", as well as a number of his best known tragedies, including \"Hamlet\", \"Othello\", \"Macbeth\", \"King Lear\" and \"Anthony and Cleopatra\". The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves. In his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: \"Cymbeline\", \"The Winter's Tale\" and \"The Tempest\", as well as the collaboration, \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\". Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, \"Henry VIII\" and \"The Two Noble Kinsmen\", probably with John Fletcher.\n\nOther important figures in the Elizabethan theatre include Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Dekker.\n\nMarlowe's (1564–1593) subject matter is different from Shakespeare's as it focuses more on the moral drama of the Renaissance man than any other thing. Drawing on German folklore, Marlowe introduced the story of Faust to England in his play \"Doctor Faustus\" (c. 1592), about a scientist and magician who, obsessed by the thirst of knowledge and the desire to push man's technological power to its limits, sells his soul to the Devil. \"Faustus\" makes use of \"the dramatic framework of the morality plays in its presentation of a story of temptation, fall, and damnation, and its free use of morality figures such as the good angel and the bad angel and the seven deadly sins, along with the devils Lucifer and Mephistopheles.\"\n\nThomas Dekker (c. 1570–1632) was, between 1598 and 1602, involved in about forty plays, usually in collaboration. He is particularly remembered for \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\" (1599), a work where he appears to be the sole author. Dekker is noted for his \"realistic portrayal of daily London life and for \"his sympathy for the poor and oppressed\".\n\nRobert Greene (c. 1558–1592) was another popular dramatist but he is now best known for a posthumous pamphlet attributed to him, \"Greenes, Groats-worth of Witte, bought with a million of Repentance\", widely believed to contain an attack on William Shakespeare.\n\nList of other of the writers born in this period:\n\n\n"}

The works in the playbook are told in a musical style similar to that of plainsong. The origin of the book is unknown, but it is possible that it was written by multiple authors. The playbook consists of a total of 10 works, occupying pages 176–243 of the manuscript.\n\nThe playbook was compiled in the late 12th century. Although it is widely accepted that the \"Fleury Playbook\" was created in the Fleury Abbey, the neumes in the musical scores are not similar to those found there, nor was the Abbey known for any achievements in drama prior to the \"Fleury Playbook\", both of which suggest that the book may have been bound elsewhere. However, the manuscript was copied and housed in the abbey's scriptorium, and may have served as an early example of a liturgical drama.\n\nThe plays are both liturgical and non-liturgical (specifically those pertaining to St. Nicholas), and may be performed both monastically and non-monastically, as the text does not specify. As each drama appears to correspond with different dates of the liturgical year, it is likely that main purpose of the playbook is not liturgical. The plays are meant to be performed, as evidenced by their structure, staging, and effects.

He was the first writer to introduce the morbid, pessimistic elements characteristic of European \"fin de siècle\" literature and philosophy into Russian prose.\n\nSologub was born in St. Petersburg into the family of a poor tailor, Kuzma Afanasyevich Teternikov, who had been a serf in Poltava guberniya, the illegitimate son of a local landowner. When his father died of tuberculosis in 1867, his illiterate mother. Tatiana Semyonovna Teternikova, was forced to become a servant in the home of the aristocratic Agapov family, where Sologub and his younger sister Olga grew up. The family took an interest in the education of young Fyodor, sending him to a pedogogical institution where Sologub was a model student. Seeing how difficult his mother's life was, Sologub was determined to rescue her from it, and after graduating from the St. Petersburg Teachers' Institute in 1882 he took his mother and sister with him to his first teaching post in Kresttsy, where he began his literary career with the 1884 publication in a children's magazine of his poem \"The Fox and the Hedgehog\" under the name Te-rnikov.\n\nSologub continued writing as he relocated to new jobs in Velikiye Luki (1885) and Vytegra (1889), but felt that he was completely isolated from the literary world and longed to be able to live in the capital again; nevertheless, his decade-long experience with the \"frightful world\" of backwoods provincial life served him well when he came to write \"The Petty Demon\". (He said later that in writing the novel he had softened the facts: \"things happened that no one would believe if I were to describe them.\") He felt sympathetic with the writers associated with the journal \"Severnyi vestnik\" (Northern Herald), including Nikolai Minsky, Zinaida Gippius, and Dmitry Merezhkovsky, who were beginning to create what would be known as the Symbolist movement, and in 1891 he visited Petersburg hoping to see Minsky and Merezhkovsky, but met only the first.\n\nIn 1892 he was finally able to relocate to the capital, where he got a job teaching mathematics, started writing what would become his most famous novel, \"The Petty Demon\", and began frequenting the offices of \"Severny Vestnik\", which published much of his writing during the next five years. There, in 1893, Minsky, who thought Teternikov was an unpoetic name, suggested that he use a pseudonym, and the aristocratic name Sollogub was decided on, but one of the \"l\"s was omitted as an attempt (unavailing, as it turned out) to avoid confusion with Count Vladimir Sollogub. In 1894 his first short story, \"Ninochkina oshibka\" (Ninochka's Mistake), was published in \"Illustrirovanny Mir\", and in the autumn of that year his mother died. In 1896 he published his first three books: a book of poems, a collection of short stories, and his first novel, \"Tyazhelye sny\" (Bad Dreams), which he had begun in 1883 and which is considered one of the first decadent Russian novels.\n\nIn April 1897 he ended his association with \"Severny Vestnik\" and, along with Merezhkovsky and Gippius, began writing for the journal \"Sever\" (North). The next year his first series of fairy tales was published. In 1899 he was appointed principal of the Andreevskoe municipal school and relocated to their premises on Vasilievsky Island; he also became a member of the St. Petersburg District School Council. He continued to publish books of poetry, and in 1902 he finished \"The Petty Demon\", which was published partially in serial form in 1905 (in \"Voprosy zhizni\", which was terminated before the final installments). At this time his \"Sundays,\" a literary group that met at his home, attracted poets, artists, and actors, including Alexander Blok, Mikhail Kuzmin, Alexei Remizov, Sergei Gorodetsky, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Léon Bakst, Mstislav Dobuzhinsky and Sergei Auslender. Teffi wrote of him at this period:\n\nHis face was pale, long, without eyebrows; by his nose was a large wart; a thin reddish beard seemed to pull away from his thin cheeks; dull, half-closed eyes. His face was always tired, always bored... Sometimes when he was a guest at someone's table he would close his eyes and remain like that for several minutes, as if he had forgotten to open them. \nHe never laughed... Sologub lived on Vasilievsky Island in the small official apartment of a municipal school where he was a teacher and inspector. He lived with his sister, a flat-chested, consumptive old maid. She was quiet and shy; she adored her brother and was a little afraid of him, and spoke of him only in a whisper. He said in a poem: \n\"We were holiday children, My sister and I\"; they were very poor, those holiday children, dreaming that someone would give them \"even motley-colored shells from a brook.\" Sadly and dully they dragged out the difficult days of their youth. The consumptive sister, not having received her share of motley shells, was already burning out. He himself was exhausted by his boring teaching job; he wrote in snatches by night, always tired from the boyish noise of his students...<br>\n<br>\nSo Sologub lived in his little official apartment with little icon lamps, serving his guests mint cakes, ruddy rolls, pastila, and honey cakes, for which his sister went across the river somewhere on a horsecar. She told us privately, \"I'd love to ride on the outside of the horsecar sometime, but my brother won't let me. He says it's unseemly for a lady.\"... Those evenings in the little apartment, when his close literary friends gathered, were very interesting.\n\nAt the time of the 1905 Revolution his politically critical \"skazochki\" (\"little tales\") were very popular and were collected into a book, \"Politicheskie skazochki\" (1906). \"The Petty Demon\" was published in a standalone edition in 1907 and quickly became popular, having ten printings during the author's lifetime. Sologub's next major prose work, \"A Created Legend\" (1905–1913) (literally \"the legend in the making,\" a trilogy consisting of \"Drops of Blood\", \"Queen Ortruda\", and \"Smoke and Ash\"), had many of the same characteristics but presented a considerably more positive and hopeful description of the world. \"It begins with the famous declaration that although life is 'vulgar . . . stagnant in darkness, dull and ordinary,' the poet 'creates from it a sweet legend . . . my legend of the enchanting and beautiful.'\"\n\nHis increasing literary success was tempered for him by his sister's tuberculosis; in 1906 he traveled with her to Ufa Guberniya for treatment, and in June 1907 he took her to Finland, where she died on 28 June. The next month he returned to St. Petersburg and retired after 25 years of teaching. In the autumn of 1908 he married the translator Anastasia Chebotarevskaya (born in 1876), whom he had met at Vyacheslav Ivanov's apartment three years before. Teffi wrote that she \"reshaped his daily life in a new and unnecessary way. A big new apartment was rented, small gilt chairs were bought. The walls of the large cold office for some reason were decorated with paintings of Leda by various painters... The quiet talks were replaced by noisy gatherings with dances and masks. Sologub shaved his mustache and beard, and everyone started to say that he resembled a Roman of the period of decline.\" He continued publishing poems, plays, and translations; the next year he traveled abroad for the first time, visiting France with his wife, and in September the dramatized version of \"The Petty Demon\" was published.\n\nBetween 1909 and 1911 \"The Complete Works of Fyodor Sologub\" were published in 12 volumes, and in 1911 a collection of critical works appeared, containing over 30 critical essays, notes, and reviews by famous writers. In 1913 he presented a lecture, \"The Art Of These Days,\" that was so successful in St. Petersburg he took it on tour all over Russia. In 1914 he started a magazine, \"Dnevniki pisatelei\" (Writers' Journals), and went abroad with his wife, but the outbreak of World War I put an end to the magazine. In 1915 two collections of his stories and tales were published in English, and in 1916 \"The Petty Demon\", all translated by John Cournos.\nSologub continued touring and giving lectures, and in 1917 he welcomed the February Revolution. During the summer he headed the Soyuz Deyatelei Iskusstva (Union of Artists) and wrote articles with a strong anti-Bolshevik attitude. He was opposed to the October Revolution but remained in Petrograd and contributed to independent newspapers until they were terminated. In 1918 he spoke on behalf of the Union Of Artists; published \"Slepaia babochka\" (The Blind Butterfly), a collection of new short stories; had a play produced in Yalta; and joined the Petersburg Union of Journalists. But by the end of the year, because of Bolshevik control of publishing and bookselling, he did not have any outlets for his writing. Lev Kleinbort wrote of that period: \"Sologub did not give lectures, but lived by selling his things.\"\n\nEven though he was in principle opposed to emigration, the desperate condition in which he and his wife found himself caused him to apply in December 1919 for permission to leave the country; he did not receive any response. Half a year later he wrote to Lenin personally, again without result. In mid-July 1921 he finally received a letter from Trotsky authorizing his departure, and he made plans to leave for Reval on 25 September. But on the evening of 23 September his wife, weakened by privation and driven to despair by the long torment of uncertainty, threw herself off the Tuchkov Bridge and drowned. \nHis wife's death grieved Sologub for the rest of his life, and he referenced it often in his subsequent writing. (A poem dated 28 November 1921, begins \"You took away my soul/ To the bottom of the river./ I will defy your wishes/ And follow you.\") He gave up any thought of leaving Russia and relocated into an apartment on the banks of the Zhdanovka River, in which his wife had drowned.\n\nIn 1921 the New Economic Policy was begun, and from the end of the year his books (which had been published abroad with increasing frequency, notably in Germany and Estonia) began to appear in Soviet Russia. In December \"Fimiamy\" (Incense), a collection of poems, was published; the next two years more poetry collections and translations were published (Balzac's \"Contes drolatiques\", Paul Verlaine, Heinrich von Kleist, Frédéric Mistral), and in 1924 the fortieth anniversary of Sologub's literary activities was celebrated at the Alexandrinsky Theater in Petersburg, with speeches by Yevgeny Zamyatin, Mikhail Kuzmin, Andrei Bely, and Osip Mandelstam, among others. In April of that year he was elected the honorary chairman of the Division of Translators in the Petersburg Union Of Writers, and two years later he became the chairman of the board of the Union. He had literary gatherings in his apartment, attended by such writers as Anna Akhmatova and Korney Chukovsky. His new poems, which had a classic simplicity, were appreciated by those to whom he read them, but they were not printed anymore.\n\nIn May 1927 Sologub became seriously ill, and by summer he could leave his bed only rarely; his last poem was dated 1 October. After a long struggle, he died on 5 December in Leningrad. Two days later he was buried next to his wife in Smolensk Cemetery.\n\nWhile Sologub's novels have become his best-known works, he has always been respected by scholars and fellow authors for his poetry. \nThe Symbolist poet Valery Bryusov admired the deceptive simplicity of Sologub's poetry and described it as possessing a Pushkinian perfection of form. Innokenty Annensky, another poet and contemporary of Sologub, wrote that the most original aspect of Sologub's poetry was its author's unwillingness to separate himself from his literature.\n\n\"The Petty Demon\" attempted to create a description of \"poshlost'\", a Russian concept that has characteristics of both evil and banality. The antihero is a provincial schoolteacher, Peredonov, notable for his complete lack of redeeming human qualities. The novel recounts the story of the morally corrupt Peredonov going insane and paranoid in an unnamed Russian provincial town, parallel with his struggle to be promoted to governmental inspector of his province. The omniscient third-person narrative allowed Sologub to combine his Symbolist tendencies and the tradition of Russian Realism in which he engaged throughout his earlier novels, a style similar to Maupassant's fantastic realism.\n\nRealistic elements of \"The Petty Demon\" include a vivid description of 19th-century rural everyday life, while a fantastic element is the presentation of Peredonov's hallucinations on equal terms with external events. While the book was received as an indictment of Russian society, it is a very metaphysical novel and one of the major prose works of the Russian Symbolist movement. James H. Billington said of it:\nThe book puts on display a Freudian treasure chest of perversions with subtlety and credibility. The name of the novel's hero, Peredonov, became a symbol of calculating concupiscence for an entire generation... He torments his students, derives erotic satisfaction from watching them kneel to pray, and systematically befouls his apartment before leaving it as part of his generalized spite against the universe.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His love for art having, however, become very decided, in his eighteenth year he entered the Trustees' Academy on Picardy Place in Edinburgh. Here he so distinguished himself that in 1826 he was invited by the Scottish artists, who had resolved to found a Scottish Academy, to join it as an associate (see Royal Scottish Academy).\n\nHarvey's first picture, \"A Village School,\" was exhibited in 1826 at the Edinburgh Institution; and from the time of the opening of the Academy in the following year he continued annually to exhibit. His best-known pictures are those depicting historical episodes in religious history from a puritan or evangelical point of view, such as \"Covenanters' Preaching,\" \"Covenanters' Communion,\" \"John Bunyan and his Blind Daughter,\" \"Sabbath Evening,\" and the \"Quitting of the Manse.\"\n\nHe was, however, equally popular in Scotland for subjects not directly religious; and \"The Bowlers,\" \"A Highland Funeral,\" \"The Curlers,\" \"A Schule Skailin',\" and \"Children Blowing Bubbles in the Church-yard of Greyfriars', Edinburgh,\" manifest the same close observation of character, artistic conception and conscientious elaboration of details.

His main research interests are the archaeology of ancient technologies, especially traction systems in Greco-Roman land transport and farming, the production and trade of ancient ceramics and the wider socioeconomic implications of these technologies, as well as Roman Gaul. His methods include the use of experimentation.\n\nBorn in 1947 in the Eastern Flemish town of Oudenaarde, Belgium, Raepsaet received his Master in Ancient History in 1969, and another one in Arts and Archaeology in 1972, both at the University of Brussels. In 1977 he completed his dissertation on the \"Pagus Condrustis\" and the Romanization of Northern Gaul. In the following year, Raepsaet became senior lecturer at the Université Libre de Bruxelles where he was appointed professor in 1992 and taught until his retirement in 2007. His courses focused, inter alia, on classical archaeology, ancient economic and social history, history of pre-industrial technologies, archaeology of Roman Gaul and excavation techniques. He founded and directed the university research units \"Laboratoire d’Archéologie classique\" and \"Centre de Recherches archéologiques\".\n\nFrom 1997 to 1999 Raepsaet co-directed a research programme on the process of technological innovation in antiquity and the Middle Ages. Currently, he works as an expert for the European Science Foundation and chairs the scientific committee of the . Since 1970 Raepsaet has been on the editorial board of the Belgian journal \"L’Antiquité Classique\" for which he has been reviewing each year about thirty books on classic archaeology, economic history and ancient technology.\n\nSince 1970 Raepsaet has participated in and directed several archaeological excavations and fieldworks in Western Europe and the eastern Mediterranean basin. These include underwater excavations at Martigues, France, and Amathus on Cyprus, as well as fieldwork at the site of the \"Diolkos\" on the Isthmus and Styra on Euboea (1984–88). He also took part in excavations in Apamea, Syria (1978–79) and in numerous archaeological projects on the Roman period in his native Belgium (since 1968). At Brussels he was in charge of temporary exhibitions of Ancient Greek marbles (\"Marbres helléniques\", 1987–88) and of Thracian gold (\"Europalia Bulgarie\", 2002).\n\nFrom 1997 to 2007 Raepsaet conducted a number of tests in experimental archaeology on ancient agricultural techniques, in particular on the efficiency of Gallo-Roman harnesses, drawbars and the reaper (\"vallus\"). Over the years Raepsaet has also been active in the study of the technology and trade of Roman ceramics, its distribution and transport network in the Roman provinces and commercial and legal aspects related to it.\n\nMuch of Raepsaet's research since the 1970s has addressed and challenged the idea, still dominant at the time, of a lack of productivity of the Roman economy. Raepsaet criticized the \"epistemological prejudice\" particularly prevalent in studies of the 1960s and 1970s: these analyzed the classical world in terms of stagnation and technological blockage, effectively preventing scholarship from approaching the sizable corpus of evidence to the contrary from an unbiased perspective.\n\nRaepsaet focused on the key role of traction systems in land transport and ploughing, a field then dominated by strong primitivist views. He demonstrated that ancient transport capacities were in fact largely identical to and as developed and efficient as those of later periods up until the 19th century, but with the Romans enjoying the additional advantage of having a superior road network at their disposal. Through his study of Gallo-Roman harnesses, Raepsaet came to reject the early, but influential theory of Richard Lefebvre des Noëttes about the inefficiency of the Roman horse collar. In reality, draught animals in antiquity were able to move heavy loads of several dozens tons overland evident, for example, in the frequent transport of ancient monoliths or the regular use of the \"Diolkos\" ship trackway.\n\nRaepsaet′s reappraisal of the technological level of ancient traction systems has been echoed and parallelled by a generation of classical scholars and historians of technology pursuing studies in diverse fields of ancient technology. From their collaborative effort to move beyond a sterile dichotomy of primitivism and modernism sprang, for example, Brill′s series on \"Technology and Change in History\" and the \"Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World\" which received the 2009 book award of the Society for the History of Technology. The increasingly positive perception of ancient technological developments and their economic impact has also contributed to a reevaluation of the performance of the ancient economy as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In this period, communities in Britain and Ireland first learned how to work metal, leading to the widespread creation of not only gold but also copper and bronze items as well. Gold artefacts in particular were prestige items used to designate the high status of those individuals who wore, or were buried with them.\n\nAround 1,500 gold objects dating to the Bronze Age survive in collections, around 1000 of them from Ireland and the other 500 from Britain; this is a much smaller number than would have been originally crafted, leading archaeologists to believe that \"many thousands of gold objects were made and used\" in the Bronze Age British Isles.\n\nRecords indicate that Bronze Age gold artefacts had begun to be discovered by the 18th century at the least, although at the time many were melted down or lost. Only with the rise of the antiquarian and then archaeological movements were the antiquity of these items recognised, after which they were more usually preserved in collections.\nThe archaeologist George Eogan noted that investigation of Bronze Age gold artefacts revealed not only \"the work of craftsmen and technicians\" from that period but also aided our understanding of \"broader aspects of society such as social stratification, trade, commerce and ritual.\"\n\nIn prehistory gold could be found in several areas of Europe; the Carpathian region, Iberia, south-western France, Brittany, Britain and Ireland. The latter in particular had rich gold reserves, and as such has been labelled an \"ancient \"El Dorado\"\". Across the world, and in many cultures, gold has been highly valued as a precious metal, in part because of its rarity and also because of its properties; for instance, unlike copper it is malleable, flexible and homogenous, and can be worked by hammering, rather than having to be worked through casting, annealing or soldering. Any products made from gold do not corrode, but instead have what has been described as an \"intrinsic beauty\", with many prehistoric peoples probably ascribing gold items a \"symbolic as well as a decorative function\".\n\nFirst developed in 1836 by Danish archaeologist Christian Jürgensen Thomsen as a part of his \"Three-age system\", the term \"Bronze Age\" is used by archaeologists to refer to those societies which have developed bronze technology but not yet learned how to work the more complicated process involved in making iron objects. The European Bronze Age lasted from circa 3200 BCE, when the Aegean civilizations of Greece first developed bronze technology, right through to c.600 BCE, when the Nordic Bronze Age came to an end with the development of iron among Scandinavian communities.\n\nThe period known by archaeologists as Bronze Age Britain lasted from c.2500 BCE through to c.800 BCE, and was defined by the adoption of copper and bronze technologies on the island. Bronze Age Ireland followed a similar, yet distinct course.\n\nThe Early Bronze Age in the British Isles was marked by the adoption of what archaeologists call the \"Beaker culture\", which had arrived from continental Europe. Eogan noted that the \"evidence from archaeology is that Beaker-using communities were the earliest metallurgists in Britain and Ireland\", with their produce including \"copper artefacts such as tanged daggers but also gold objects as well as the use of gold for embellishment.\"\n\nBronze Age goldwork is marked by an elegant simplicity of design and fine execution, with decoration usually restricted to relatively simple geometric patterns such as parallel lines, chevron, zig-zag and circular patterns, often extremely small and perfectly executed, especially in Ireland, as can be seen by enlarging the lunula and Irish bracelet illustrated. The objects are nearly all pieces of jewellery, and include clothes-fasteners (somewhat like large one-piece cuff-links), torcs, bracelets, gold lunulae, smaller ornaments that were perhaps worn in the ear, nose or hair, or on clothing as brooches, and a range of thin disc or plaques probably sewn to clothing or worn in the hair. The ends of objects that are essentially bars bent into a round shape often thicken before ending in a flat or concave face, as for example in the Milton Keynes Hoard. The thickening is typically slight in torcs and bracelets, but extreme in clothes fasteners and ear decorations. Tightly wound spirals in pairs are popular, as they were on the continent.\n\nEogan (1994) noted that around 250 surviving gold objects are known to date to the Early Bronze Age, 165 of those from Ireland, and the other 83 from Britain. From analysing the designs of the earliest gold artefacts in Britain, Eogan noted that they \"form a homogeneous group\" which, when \"taken in conjunction with other metal types demonstrate that a new technology was introduced.\" Early Bronze Age pieces are generally much smaller, with very thin decorated discs or plaques common. Two small gold cups have been found in England, the Rillaton Cup and the similar but now crushed Ringlemere Cup.\n\nDue to its natural resources, Ireland had a \"rich Early Bronze Age [metal-working] industry\", producing large quantities of metal axes, halberds and daggers, and as a part of this also had a \"major gold industry\", seeing the production of lunulae and gold disks on a far larger scale than Britain.\n\nThe transition to the Late Bronze Age brought societal change to the British Isles, and also apparently increased availability of gold, which led to a trend to much larger and more massive pieces. The largest were jewellery worn round the neck in a range of styles, the most ostentatious wide flat collars or gorgets with ribbed decoration following the shape of the piece, and round discs at the side. The Mold Cape is unique among survivals, but fits in with the trend to massive pieces emphasizing the neck and chest. It was clearly not for prolonged wear, as the wearer could not raise their arms. In Ireland, lunulae were probably replaced as neck ornaments firstly by gold torcs, found from the Irish Middle Bronze Age, and then in the Late Bronze Age by the spectacular \"gorgets\" of thin ribbed gold, some with round discs at the side, of which 9 examples survive, 7 in the National Museum of Ireland.\n\nDesigns based on twisted bars or ribbons giving a spiral became popular, probably influenced by the Continent. \"Although over 110 identifiable British [includes Ireland] ribbon torcs are known, the dating of these simple, flexible ornaments is elusive\", perhaps indicating \"a long-lived preference for ribbon torcs, which continued for over 1,000 years\", into the Iron Age.\n\nIn Bronze Age Britain, gold objects were prestigious items, and archaeologists believe that those who owned them, or were buried with them, had a high status in society. Archaeologist George Eogan noted that gold reflected \"ostentation in society, a society that has divisions along rank.\"\n\nArchaeologist George Eogan, in his study of Bronze Age gold-working, noted that very few Bronze Age gold artefacts had been discovered through \"controlled archaeological investigation\", with the majority instead having been unearthed \"by chance\", as a result of \"agricultural activities or peat-cutting\".\n\nAntiquarian interest in the gold artefacts of prehistory emerged in the British Isles during the Early Modern period. In 1696, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, southern England obtained the Ballyshannon Disk, the first such artefact of its type in their collection, although in ensuing centuries they would gain a number of other items to accompany it. The British Museum in London would follow suit almost a century later, gaining its first Bronze Age gold artefact, a disk from Kirk Andrews on the Isle of Man, in 1782.\n\nIn 1980, Joan J. Taylor published the first comprehensive study of the available evidence, entitled \"Bronze Age Goldwork of the British Isles\". In 1994, the archaeologist George Eogan published an academic monograph on the subject, entitled \"The Accomplished Art: Gold and Gold-Working in Britain and Ireland during the Bronze Age\", which was brought out through the U.K.-based Oxbow Books. In it, Eogan noted that his study was \"not a \"corpus\" or catalogue\" of artefacts, instead being \"an evaluation and interpretation of the material in social terms\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7391958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7391958", "title": "Great Divergence", "text": "Great Divergence\n\nThe Great Divergence is a term made popular by Kenneth Pomeranz's book by that title, (also known as the European miracle, a term coined by Eric Jones in 1981) referring to the process by which the Western world (i.e. Western Europe and the parts of the New World where its people became the dominant populations) overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization, eclipsing Medieval India, Qing China, the Islamic World, Joseon Korea, and Tokugawa Japan.\n\nScholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including geography, culture, institutions, colonialism, resources, and \"accidents of history\". Scholars also trace back the beginning of the Great Divergence to different periods, with many tracing it back to the Industrial Revolution in 18th-century Britain, while others trace it back to earlier periods of Western history, such as the commercial revolution and the origins of mercantilism and capitalism during the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery, the rise of the European colonial empires, proto-globalization, the Scientific Revolution, or the Age of Enlightenment. The \"traditional view\", sometimes described as a near-consensus view, is that the Great Divergence occurred before the Industrial Revolution, with Western European states surpassing China, Japan and the Middle East by 1750. However, the \"revisionist\" view of the \"California School\" estimates that the divergence started around 1800 during the Industrial Revolution. In the twentieth century, the Great Divergence peaked before the First World War and continued until the early 1970s, then, after two decades of indeterminate fluctuations, in the late 1980s it was replaced by the Great Convergence as the majority of Third World countries reached economic growth rates significantly higher than those in most First World countries.\n\nTechnological advances, in areas such as railroads, steamboats, mining, and agriculture, were embraced to a higher degree in the West than the East during the Great Divergence. Technology led to increased industrialization and economic complexity in the areas of agriculture, trade, fuel and resources, further separating the East and the West. Western Europe's use of coal as an energy substitute for wood in the mid-19th century gave it a major head start in modern energy production.\n\nThe term \"Great Divergence\" was coined by Samuel P. Huntington in 1996 and used by Kenneth Pomeranz in his book \"The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy\" (2000). The same phenomenon was discussed by Eric Jones, whose 1981 book \"\" popularized the alternate term \"European Miracle\". Broadly, both terms signify a socioeconomic shift in which European countries advanced ahead of others during the modern period.\n\nThe timing of the Great Divergence is in dispute among historians. The traditional dating is as early as the 16th (or even 15th) century, with scholars arguing that Europe had been on a trajectory of higher growth since that date. Pomeranz and others argue that the period of most rapid divergence was during the 19th century. Citing nutrition data and chronic European trade deficits as evidence, these scholars argue that before that date Asia was wealthier and more advanced, especially China in the Yangzi Delta and India, as well as Egypt. Others, while accepting parity of incomes between the most prosperous parts of China, India, Egypt and Europe in the late 18th century, trace the first significant changes in European economies back to the 17th century. Others argue that the cultural factors behind the divergence can be traced to earlier periods and institutions such as the Renaissance and the Chinese imperial examination system.\n\nUnlike modern industrial economies, pre-modern economies were constrained by conditions which greatly limited economic growth. Although core regions in Eurasia had achieved a relatively high standard of living by the 18th century, shortages of land, soil degradation, deforestation, lack of dependable energy sources, and other ecological constraints limited growth in per capita incomes. Rapid rates of depreciation on capital meant that a great part of savings in pre-modern economies were spent on replacing depleted capital, hampering capital accumulation. Massive windfalls of fuel, land, food and other resources were necessary for continued growth and capital accumulation, leading to colonialism.\nThe Industrial Revolution overcame these restraints, allowing rapid, sustained growth in per capita incomes for the first time in human history.\n\nAfter the Viking, Muslim and Magyar invasions waned in the 10th century, Europe entered a period of prosperity, population growth and territorial expansion known as the High Middle Ages.\nTrade and commerce revived, with increased specialization between areas and between the countryside and artisans in towns.\nBy the 13th century the best land had been occupied and agricultural income began to fall, though trade and commerce continued to expand, especially in Venice and other northern Italian cities.\nThe 14th century brought a series of calamities: famines, wars, the Black Death and other epidemics.\nThe resulting drop in the population led to falling rents and rising wages, undermining the feudal and manorial relationships that had characterized Medieval Europe.\n\nAccording to a 2014 study, \"there was a ‘little divergence’ within Europe between 1300 and 1800: real wages in the North Sea area more or less stabilized at the level attained after the Black Death, and remained relatively high (above subsistence) throughout the early modern period (and into the nineteenth century); whereas, on the other hand, real wages in the ‘periphery’ (in Germany, Italy, and Spain) began to fall after the fifteenth century and returned to some kind of subsistence minimum during the 1500–1800 period. This ‘little divergence’ in real wages mirrors a similar divergence in GDP per capita: in the ‘periphery’ of Europe there was almost no per capita growth (or even a decline) between 1500 and 1800, whereas in Holland and England real income continued to rise and more or less doubled in this period.\"\n\nIn the Age of Exploration navigators discovered new routes to the Americas and Asia.\nCommerce expanded, together with innovations such as joint stock companies and various financial institutions.\nNew military technologies favored larger units, leading to a concentration of power in states whose finances relied on trade.\nFrance and Spain developed absolute monarchies reliant on high taxes and state-backed monopolies, leading to economic decline.\nThe Dutch Republic was controlled by merchants, while Parliament gained control of England after a long struggle culminating in the Glorious Revolution.\nThese arrangements proved more hospitable to economic development.\nAt the end of the 16th century London and Antwerp began pulling away from other European cities, as illustrated in the following graph of real wages in several European cities:\n\nThe West had a series of unique advantages compared to Asia, such as the proximity of coal mines; the discovery of the New World, which alleviated ecological restraints on economic growth (land shortages etc.); and the profits from colonization.\n\nChina had a larger population than Europe throughout the Common Era.\nUnlike Europe, it was politically united for long periods during that time.\n\nDuring the Song Dynasty (960–1279), the country experienced a revolution in agriculture, water transport, finance, urbanization, science and technology, which made the Chinese economy the most advanced in the world from about 1100. Mastery of wet-field rice cultivation opened up the hitherto underdeveloped south of the country, while later northern China was devastated by Jurchen and Mongol invasions, floods and epidemics. The result was a dramatic shift in the center of population and industry from the home of Chinese civilization around the Yellow River to the south of the country, a trend only partially reversed by the re-population of the north from the 15th century. By 1300, China had fallen behind Italy in living standards.\n\nIn the late imperial period (1368–1911), comprising the Ming and Qing dynasties, taxation was low, and the economy and population grew significantly, though without substantial increases in productivity.\nChinese goods such as silk, tea and ceramics were in great demand in Europe, leading to an inflow of silver, expanding the money supply and facilitating the growth of competitive and stable markets.\nBy the end of the 18th century, population density levels exceeded those in Europe. China had more large cities but far fewer small ones than in contemporary Europe. The traditional view is that the Great Divergence between China and Europe had begun by 1750, before the Industrial Revolution. Revisionist scholarship, however, estimates that the Great Divergence did not begin until the 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution.\n\nBy the 1500s, India benefited from extensive external and internal trade. Its agriculture was highly efficient as well as its industry. Unlike China, Japan and western and central Europe, India did not experience extensive deforestation until the 19th and 20th centuries. It thus had no pressure to move to coal as a source of energy. From the 17th century, cotton textiles from Mughal India became popular in Europe, with some governments banning them to protect their wool industries. In the 18th century, India was the most important manufacturer in world trade, producing about 25% of the world's industrial output in 1750, with Mughal Bengal in particular being globally dominant in industries such as textile manufacturing and shipbuilding.\n\nIn early modern Europe, there was significant demand for products from Mughal India, particularly cotton textiles, as well as goods such as spices, peppers, indigo, silks, and saltpeter (for use in munitions). European fashion, for example, became increasingly dependent on Indian textiles and silks. In the 17th and 18th centuries, India accounted for 95% of British imports from Asia, and the Bengal Subah alone accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia. Amiya Kumar Bagchi estimates 10.3% of Bihar's populace were involved in hand spinning thread, 2.3% weaving, and 9% in other manufacturing trades, in 1809-13, to satisfy this demand. In contrast, there was very little demand for European goods in India, which was largely self-sufficient, thus Europeans had very little to offer, except for some woolen textiles, unprocessed metals and a few luxury items. The trade imbalance caused Europeans to export large quantities of gold and silver to India in order to pay for Indian imports.\n\nThe Middle East was more advanced than Western Europe in 1000 CE, on par by the middle of the 16th century, but by 1750, leading Middle-Eastern states had fallen behind the leading Western European states of Britain and the Netherlands.\n\nAn example of a Middle-Eastern country that had an advanced economy in the early 19th century was Ottoman Egypt, which had a highly productive industrial manufacturing sector, and per-capita income that was comparable to leading Western European countries such as France and higher than that of Japan and Eastern Europe. Other parts of the Ottoman Empire, particularly Syria and southeastern Anatolia, also had a highly productive manufacturing sector that was evolving in the 19th century. In 1819, Egypt under Muhammad Ali began programs of state-sponsored industrialization, which included setting up factories for weapons production, an iron foundry, large-scale cotton cultivation, mills for ginning, spinning and weaving of cotton, and enterprises for agricultural processing. By the early 1830s, Egypt had 30 cotton mills, employing about 30,000 workers. In the early 19th century, Egypt had the world's fifth most productive cotton industry, in terms of the number of spindles per capita. The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as animal power, water wheels, and windmills, which were also the principle energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870. While steam power had been experimented with in Ottoman Egypt by engineer Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in 1551, when he invented a steam jack driven by a rudimentary steam turbine, it was under Muhammad Ali of Egypt in the early 19th century that steam engines were introduced to Egyptian industrial manufacturing. Boilers were manufactured and installed in Egyptian industries such as ironworks, textile manufacturing, paper mills, and hulling mills. Compared to Western Europe, Egypt also had superior agriculture and an efficient transport network through the Nile. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization existed in Egypt during the 1820s–1830s.\n\nAfter the death of Muhammad Ali in 1849, his industrialization programs fell into decline, after which, according to historian Zachary Lockman, “Egypt was well on its way to full integration into a European-dominated world market as supplier of a single raw material, cotton.” Lockman argues that, had Egypt succeeded in its industrialization programs, “it might have shared with Japan [or the United States] the distinction of achieving autonomous capitalist development and preserving its independence.”\n\nJapanese society was governed by the Tokugawa Shogunate, which divided Japanese society into a strict hierarchy and intervened considerably in the economy through state monopolies and restrictions on foreign trade; however, in practice, the Shogunate's rule was often circumvented. From 725-1974, Japan experienced GDP per capita growth at an annual rate of 0.04%, with major periods of positive per capita GDP growth occurring during 1150-1280, 1450-1600 and after 1730. There were no significant periods of sustained growth reversals. Relative to the United Kingdom, GDP per capita was at roughly similar levels until the middle of the 17th century. By 1850, per capita incomes in Japan were approximately a quarter of the British level. However, 18th-century Japan had a higher life expectancy, 41.1 years for adult males, compared with 31.6 to 34 for England, between 27.5 and 30 for France, and 24.7 for Prussia.\n\nIn its earlier days, Korea had healthy international trading relationships, receiving merchants from as far as the Middle East. Because of its strategic value to its neighboring countries, however, Korea had been invaded several times during its Goryeo and Joseon eras, starting with the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. Though repelled due to its strong navy and aid from China, the Japanese invasions in the late 16th century were particularly devastating to the peninsula and it never truly recovered until the modern era. Due to relatively frequent invasions, increased Western colonization of Asia, and the arrival of Christian missionaries, Korea began a long period of isolationism, maintaining diplomatic relationships primarily with China only. For the rest of the Joseon period, the country was marred by economic hardships, peasant revolts, and political factionalism until it was annexed by Japan in the early 20th century.\n\nPre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa was politically fragmented, just as early modern Europe was. Africa was however far more sparsely populated than Europe. According to University of Michigan political scientist Mark Dincecco, \"the high land/ labor ratio may have made it less likely that historical institutional centralization at the “national level” would occur in sub-Saharan Africa, thwarting further state development.\" The transatlantic slave trade may have further weakened state power in Africa.\n\nScholars have proposed numerous theories to explain why the Great Divergence occurred.\n\nIn metallurgy and steam engines the Industrial Revolution made extensive use of coal and coke - as cheaper, more plentiful and more efficient than wood and charcoal.\nCoal-fired steam engines also operated in the railways and in shipping, revolutionizing transport in the early 19th century.\n\nKenneth Pomeranz drew attention to differences in the availability of coal between West and East. Due to regional climate, European coal mines were wetter, and deep mines did not become practical until the introduction of the Newcomen steam engine to pump out groundwater. In mines in the arid northwest of China, ventilation to prevent explosions was much more difficult.\n\nAnother difference involved geographic distance; although China and Europe had comparable mining technologies, the distances between the economically developed regions and coal deposits differed vastly. The largest coal deposits in China are located in the northwest, within reach of the Chinese industrial core during the Northern Song (960-1127). During the 11th century China developed sophisticated technologies to extract and use coal for energy, leading to soaring iron production. The southward population shift between the 12th and 14th centuries resulted in new centers of Chinese industry far from the major coal deposits. Some small coal deposits were available locally, though their use was sometimes hampered by government regulations. In contrast, Britain contained some of the largest coal deposits in Europe - all within a relatively compact island.\n\nOttoman Egypt, which used steam power for industrial manufacturing under Muhammad Ali Pasha (ruled 1805-1848), had a lack of coal resources. However, Muhammad Ali Pasha's prospectors searched for coal deposits, and boilers were manufactured and installed in various industries. Egypt also imported coal from overseas, at similar prices to what imported coal cost in France, until the 1830s, when Cairo gained access to coal sources in Lebanon, which had a yearly coal output of 4,000 tons. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that, in addition to having the necessary conditions for rapid industrialization, Egypt also had the necessary conditions for the adoption of oil as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.\n\nA common argument is that Europe had more free and efficient markets than other civilizations, which has been cited as a reason for the Great Divergence. In Europe, market efficiency was disrupted by the prevalence of feudalism and mercantilism. Practices such as entail, which restricted land ownership, hampered the free flow of labor and buying and selling of land. These feudal restrictions on land ownership were especially strong in continental Europe. China had a relatively more liberal land market, hampered only by weak customary traditions. Bound labor, such as serfdom and slavery were more prevalent in Europe than in China, even during the Manchu conquest. Urban industry in the West was more restrained by guilds and state-enforced monopolies than in China, where in the 18th century the principal monopolies governed salt and foreign trade through Guangzhou. Pomeranz rejects the view that market institutions were the cause of the Great Divergence, and concludes that China was closer to the ideal of a market economy than Europe.\n\nEconomic historian Paul Bairoch presents a contrary argument, that Western countries such as the United States, Britain and Spain did not initially have free trade, but had protectionist policies in the early 19th century, as did China and Japan. In contrast, he cites the Ottoman Empire as an example of a state that did have free trade, which he argues had a negative economic impact and contributed to its deindustrialization. The Ottoman Empire had a liberal trade policy, open to foreign imports, which has origins in capitulations of the Ottoman Empire, dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with capitulations in 1673 and 1740, which lowered duties to only 3% for imports and exports. The liberal Ottoman policies were praised by British economists advocating free trade, such as J. R. McCulloch in his \"Dictionary of Commerce\" (1834), but later criticized by British politicians opposing free trade, such as prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, who cited the Ottoman Empire as \"an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition\" in the 1846 Corn Laws debate:\n\nJared Diamond in the book \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" argues that explicit outlawing of new technology was an important explanation for the divergence. For example, in China in 1432, a new Emperor outlawed the building of ocean-going ships, in which China was the world leader at the time. Diamond traces this to differences in geography. Outside Europe advanced cultures developed in areas whose geography was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires. In these conditions policies of technological and social stagnation could persist. On the other hand, Europe's geography favored balkanization into smaller, closer, nation-states, as its many natural barriers (mountains, rivers) provide defensible borders. As a result, governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were out-competed relatively quickly. He argues that geographical factors created the conditions for more rapid internal superpower change (Spain succeeded by France and then by the United Kingdom) than was possible elsewhere in Eurasia.\n\nBeginning in the early 19th century, economic prosperity rose greatly in the West due to improvements in technological efficiency, as evidenced by the advent of new conveniences including the railroad, steamboat, steam engine, and the use of coal as a fuel source. These innovations contributed to the Great Divergence, elevating Europe and the United States to high economic standing relative to the East.\n\nIt has been argued the attitude of the East towards innovation is one of the other factors that might have played a big role in the West's advancements over the East. According to David Landes, after a few centuries of innovations and inventions, it seemed like the East stopped trying to innovate and began to sustain what they had. They kept nurturing their pre-modern inventions and did not move forward with the modern times. China decided to continue a self-sustaining process of scientific and technological advancement on the basis of their indigenous traditions and achievements. The East’s attitude towards innovation showed that they focused more on experience, while the West focused on experimentation. The East did not see the need to improve on their inventions and thus from experience, focused on their past successes. While they did this, the West was focused more on experimentation and trial by error, which led them to come up with new and different ways to improve on existing innovations and create new ones.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Egypt under Muhammad Ali began a program of state-sponsored industrialization, quick to adopt steam engine technology, and manufacturing boilers for installation in a number of industries, including ironworks, textile manufacturing, paper mills, and hulling mills. While there was a lack of coal deposits in Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha's prospectors searched for coal deposits in Egypt while importing coal from overseas at similar prices to what imported coal cost in France, until the 1830s when Egypt gained access to coal sources in Lebanon with its yearly coal output of 4,000 tons. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that Egypt had the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization in the early 19th century, and for the adoption of oil as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.\n\nClassical economists, beginning with Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus, argued that high wages in the West stimulated labor-saving technological advancements. Economic historian Robert Allen has argued that high wages, cheap capital and very cheap energy in Britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution to occur. These factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development, and to put technology to use in Britain than other societies.\n\nHowever, more recent studies have depicted living standards in 18th century China and pre-Industrial Revolution Europe as comparable. Life expectancy in China and Japan for adult males were 39.6 and 41.1 respectively, compared with 34 for England, between 27.5 and 30 for France, and 24.7 for Prussia. Chinese laborers in the Yangtze delta consumed 4,600 calories per day on average (laborers in China overall consumed 2,637 calories on average) compared with 2,000-2,500 calories per day for England. According to Pomeranz and others, there was modest per capita growth in both regions, the Chinese economy was not stagnant, and in many areas, especially agriculture, was ahead of Western Europe. Chinese cities were also ahead in public health. Economic historian Paul Bairoch estimated that China's GNP per capita in 1800 was $228 in 1960 US dollars ($ in 1990 dollars), higher than Western Europe's $213 ($ in 1990 dollars) at the time.\n\nThere have been similar findings for India. Real wages and living standards in 18th-century Bengal and Mysore were higher than in Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe. Workers in the textile industry, for example, earned more in Bengal and Mysore than they did in Britain, while agricultural labour in Britain had to work longer hours to earn the same amount as in Mysore. In the late 18th century, Mysore's average per-capita income was five times higher than subsistence level, i.e. five times higher than $400 (1990 international dollars), or $2,000 per capita. In comparison, the highest national per-capita incomes in 1820 were $1,838 for the Netherlands and $1,706 for Britain.\n\nSimilarly for Ottoman Egypt, its per-capita income in 1800 was comparable to that of leading Western European countries such as France, and higher than the overall average income of Europe and Japan. Economic historian Jean Barou estimated that, in terms of 1960 dollars, Egypt in 1800 had a per-capita income of $232 ($ in 1990 dollars). In comparison, per-capita income in terms of 1960 dollars for France in 1800 was $240 ($ in 1990 dollars), for Eastern Europe in 1800 was $177 ($ in 1990 dollars), and for Japan in 1800 was $180 ($ in 1990 dollars).\n\nAccording to Paul Bairoch, in the mid-18th century, \"the average standard of living in Europe was a little bit lower than that of the rest of the world.\" He estimated that, in 1750, the average GNP per capita in the Eastern world (particularly China, India and the Middle East) was $188 in 1960 dollars ($ in 1990 dollars), higher than the West's $182 ($ in 1990 dollars). He argues that it was after 1800 that Western European per-capita income pulled ahead. However, the average incomes of China and Egypt were still higher than the overall average income of Europe.\n\nA number of economic historians have argued that European colonialism played a major role in the deindustrialization of non-Western societies. Paul Bairoch, for example, cites British colonialism in India as a primary example, but also argues that European colonialism played a major role in the deindustrialization of other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, and contributed to a sharp economic decline in Africa. Other modern economic historians have blamed British colonial rule for India's deindustrialization in particular. The colonization of India is seen as a major factor behind both India's deindustrialization and Britain's Industrial Revolution.\n\nUp until the 19th century, India was the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer, with Bengal and Mysore the centers of cotton production. In order to compete with India, Britain invested in labour-saving technical progress for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, while implementing protectionist policies such as bans and tariffs to restrict Indian imports. At the same time, the British East India Company's rule in India contributed to its deindustrialization, with the decline of native industry opening up a new market for British goods. British colonization forced open the large Indian market to British goods while restricting Indian imports to Britain, and raw cotton was imported from India without taxes or tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton and sold them back to the Indian market. India thus served as both an important supplier of raw goods such as cotton to British factories and a large captive market for British manufactured goods. In addition, the capital amassed from Bengal following its conquest after the Battle of Plassey in 1757 was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth. Britain eventually surpassed India as the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century. British colonial rule has been blamed for the subsequently dismal state of British India's economy, with investment in Indian industries limited since it was a colony.\n\nLuxury consumption is regarded by many scholars to have stimulated the development of capitalism and thus contributed to the Great Divergence. Proponents of this view argue that workshops, which manufactured luxury articles for the wealthy, gradually amassed capital to expand their production and then emerged as large firms producing for a mass market; they believe that Western Europe's unique tastes for luxury stimulated this development further than other cultures. However, others counter that luxury workshops were not unique to Europe; large cities in China and Japan also possessed many luxury workshops for the wealthy, and that luxury workshops do not necessarily stimulate the development of \"capitalistic firms\".\n\nDifferences in property rights have been cited as a possible cause of the Great Divergence. This view states that Asian merchants could not develop and accumulate capital because of the risk of state expropriation and claims from fellow kinsmen, which made property rights very insecure compared to those of Europe. However, others counter that many European merchants were de facto expropriated through defaults on government debt, and that the threat of expropriation by Asian states was not much greater than in Europe, except in Japan.\n\nGovernment and policies are seen as an integral part of modern societies and have played a major role in how different economies have been formed. The Eastern societies had governments which were controlled by the ruling dynasties and thus, were not a separate entity. Their governments at the time lacked policies that fostered innovation and thus resulted in slow advancements. As explained by Cohen, the east had a restrictive system of trade that went against the free world market theory; there was no political liberty or policies that encouraged the capitalist market (Cohen, 1993). This was in contrast to the western society that developed commercial laws and property rights which allowed for the protection and liberty of the marketplace. Their capitalist ideals and market structures encouraged innovation.\n\nPomeranz (2000) argues that much of the land market in China was free, with many supposedly hereditary tenants and landlords being frequently removed or forced to sell their land. Although Chinese customary law specified that people within the village were to be offered the land first, Pomeranz states that most of the time the land was offered to more capable outsiders, and argues that China actually had a freer land market than Europe.\nPomeranz does not address the most common form of land sale, known as the conditional sale. The conditional sale allowed the seller to return to the buyer many years after the sale, and many times, to demand extra payments. He also does not account for the inability of landlords to collect rent on second crops.\n\nHowever, Robert Brenner and Chris Isett emphasize differences in land tenancy rights. They argue that in the lower Yangtze, most farmers either owned land or held secure tenancy at fixed rates of rent, so that neither farmers nor landlords were exposed to competition. In 15th century England, lords had lost their serfs, but were able to assert control over almost all of the land, creating a rental market for tenant farmers. This created competitive pressures against subdividing plots, and the fact that plots could not be directly passed on to sons forced them to delay marriage until they had accumulated their own possessions. Thus in England both agricultural productivity and population growth were subject to market pressures throughout the early modern period.\n\nA 2017 study found that secure property rights in Europe, but not in large parts of the Middle-East, contributed to the increase of expensive labour-saving capital goods, such as water-mills, windmills, and cranes, in medieval Europe but its decrease in the Middle-East.\n\nA variety of theories posit Europe's unique relationship with the New World as a major cause of the Great Divergence. The high profits earned from the colonies and the slave trade constituted 7 percent a year, a relatively high rate of return considering the high rate of depreciation on pre-industrial capital stocks, which limited the amount of savings and capital accumulation. Early European colonization was sustained by profits through selling New World goods to Asia, especially silver to China. According to Pomeranz, the most important advantage for Europe was the vast amount of fertile, uncultivated land in the Americas which could be used to grow large quantities of farm products required to sustain European economic growth and allowed labor and land to be freed up in Europe for industrialization. New World exports of wood, cotton, and wool are estimated to have saved England the need for 23 to of cultivated land (by comparison, the total amount of cultivated land in England was just 17 million acres), freeing up immense amounts of resources. The New World also served as a market for European manufactures.\n\nChen (2012) also suggested that the New World as a necessary factor for industrialization, and trade as a supporting factor causing less developed areas to concentrate on agriculture supporting industrialized regions in Europe.\n\nThe high-level equilibrium trap theory argues that China did not undergo an indigenous industrial revolution since its economy was in a stable equilibrium, where supply and demand for labor were equal, disincentivizing the development of labor-saving capital.\n\nRosenberg and Birdzell claims that the so-called \"eastern culture\" of \"respect\" and \"unquestionable devotion\" to the ruling dynasty was as a result of a culture where the control of the dynasty led to a \"silent society\" that \"did not ask questions or experiment without the approval or order from the ruling class\". On the other hand, they claimed that the West of the late medieval era did not have a central authority or absolute state, which allowed for a free flow of ideas (Rosenberg, Birdzell, 1986). This so-called \"eastern culture\" also supposedly showed a \"dismissal of change\" due to their \"fear of failure\" and disregard for the imitation of outside inventions and science; this was different from the \"western culture\" which they claimed to be willing to experiment and imitate others to benefit their society. They claimed that this was a culture where change was encouraged, and sense of anxiety and disregard for comfort led them to be more innovative. Max Weber argued in \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\" that capitalism in northern Europe evolved when the Protestant work ethic (particularly Calvinist) influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In his book \"\" he blames Chinese culture for the non-emergence of capitalism in China. Chen (2012) similarly claims that cultural differences were the most fundamental cause for the divergence, arguing that the Humanism of the Renaissance followed by the Enlightenment (including revolutionary changes in attitude towards religion) enabled a mercantile, innovative, individualistic, and capitalistic spirit. For Ming Dynasty China, he claims there existed repressive measures which stifled dissenting opinions and nonconformity. He claimed that Confucianism taught that disobedience to one's superiors was supposedly tantamount to \"sin\". In addition Chen claimed that merchants and artificers had less prestige than they did in Western Europe. Justin Yifu Lin has argued for the role of the imperial examination system in removing the incentives for Chinese intellectuals to learn mathematics or to conduct experimentation.\n\nHowever, many scholars who have studied Confucian teachings have criticized the claim that the philosophy promoted unquestionable loyalty to one's superiors and the state. The core of Confucian philosophy itself was already Humanistic and Rationalistic; it \"[does] not share a belief in divine law and [does] not exalt faithfulness to a higher law as a manifestation of divine will.\"\n\nOne of the central teachings of Confucianism is that one should remonstrate with authority. Many Confucians throughout history disputed their superiors in order to not only prevent the superiors and the rulers from wrongdoing, but also to maintain the independent spirits of the Confucians.\n\nFurthermore, the merchant class of China throughout all of Chinese history were usually wealthy and held considerable influence above their supposed social standing. Historians like Yu Yingshi and Billy So have shown that as Chinese society became increasingly commercialized from the Song dynasty onward, Confucianism had gradually begun to accept and even support business and trade as legitimate and viable professions, as long as merchants stayed away from unethical actions. Merchants in the meantime had also benefited from and utilized Confucian ethics in their business practices. By the Song period, the Scholar-officials themselves were using intermediary agents to participate in trading.\nThis is true especially in the Ming-Qing dynasties, when the social status of merchants had rose to such significance that by the late Ming period, many scholar-officials were unabashed to declare publicly in their official family histories that they had family members who were merchants. Consequently, while Confucianism did not actively promote profit seeking, it did not hinder China’s commercial development either.\n\nOf the developed cores of the Old world, India was distinguished by its caste system of bound labor, which hampered economic and population growth and resulted in relative underdevelopment compared to other core regions. Compared with other developed regions, India still possessed large amounts of unused resources. India's caste system gave an incentive to elites to drive their unfree laborers harder when faced with increased demand, rather than invest in new capital projects and technology. The Indian economy was characterized by vassal-lord relationships, which weakened the motive of financial profit and the development of markets; a talented artisan or merchant could not hope to gain much personal reward. Pomeranz argues that India was not a very likely site for an industrial breakthrough, despite its sophisticated commerce and technologies.\n\nAspects of Islamic law have been proposed as an argument for the divergence for the Muslim world. Economist Timur Kuran argues that Islamic institutions which had at earlier stages promoted development later started preventing more advanced development by hampering formation of corporations, capital accumulation, mass production, and impersonal transactions. Other similar arguments proposed include the gradual prohibition of independent religious judgements (Ijtihad) and a strong communalism which limited contacts with outside groups and the development of institutions dealing with more temporary interactions of various kinds, according to Kuran. According to historian Donald Quataert, however, the Ottoman Middle East's manufacturing sector was highly productive and evolving in the 19th century. Quataert criticizes arguments rooted in Orientalism, such as \"now-discredited stereotypes concerning the inferiority of Islam\", economic institutions having stopped evolving after the Islamic Golden Age, and decline of Ijtihad in religion negatively affecting economic evolution. Economic historian Paul Bairoch noted that Ottoman law promoted liberal free trade earlier than Britain and the United States, arguing that free trade had a negative economic impact on the Ottoman Empire and contributed to its deindustrialization, in contrast to the more protectionist policies of Britain and the United States in the early 19th century.\n\nIn his book \"A Farewell to Alms\", Gregory Clark argues that the human psychological traits (such as literacy, numeracy, and delayed gratification) needed for the divergence spread in England between 1200 and 1800 \"at least culturally and perhaps also genetically\". A shorter online version of Clark's work can be found here: http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/papers/Capitalism%20Genes.pdf\n\nEconomic historian Joel Mokyr has argued that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China. China had both a printing press and movable type, yet the industrial revolution would occur in Europe. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an \"integrated market for ideas\" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the Republic of Letters.\n\nEconomic historian Tuan-Hwee Sng has argued that the large size of the Chinese state contributed to its relative decline in the 19th century:The vast size of the Chinese empire created a severe principal-agent problem and constrained how the country was governed. In particular, taxes had to be kept low due to the emperor's weak oversight of his agents and the need to keep corruption in check. The Chinese state's fiscal weaknesses were long masked by its huge tax base. However, economic and demographic expansion in the eighteenth century exacerbated the problems of administrative control. This put a further squeeze on the nation's finances and left China ill-prepared for the challenges of the nineteenth century.One reason why Japan was able to modernize and adopt the technologies of the West was due to its much smaller size relative to China.\n\nThe historian Jeffrey G. Williamson has argued that India went through a period of deindustrialization in the latter half of the 18th century as an indirect outcome of the collapse of the Mughal Empire, with British rule later causing further deindustrialization. According to Williamson, the decline of the Mughal Empire led to a decline in agricultural productivity, which drove up food prices, then nominal wages, and then textile prices, which led to India losing a share of the world textile market to Britain even before it had superior factory technology, though Indian textiles still maintained a competitive advantage over British textiles up until the 19th century. Economic historian Prasannan Parthasarathi, however, has argued that there wasn't any such economic decline for several post-Mughal states, notably Bengal Subah and the Kingdom of Mysore, which were comparable to Britain in the late 18th century, until British colonial policies caused deindustrialization.\n\nStanford political scientist Gary W. Cox argues in a 2017 study,that Europe's political fragmentation interacted with her institutional innovations to foster substantial areas of “economic liberty,” where European merchants could organize production freer of central regulation, faced fewer central restrictions on their shipping and pricing decisions, and paid lower tariffs and tolls than their counterparts elsewhere in Eurasia. When fragmentation afforded merchants multiple politically independent routes on which to ship their goods, European rulers refrained from imposing onerous regulations and levying arbitrary tolls, lest they lose mercantile traffic to competing realms. Fragmented control of trade routes magnified the spillover effects of political reforms. If parliament curbed arbitrary regulations and tolls in one realm, then neighboring rulers might have to respond in kind, even if they themselves remained without a parliament. Greater economic liberty, fostered by the interaction of fragmentation and reform, unleashed faster and more inter-connected urban growth. Justin Yifu Lin argued that China's large population size proved beneficial in technological advancements prior to the 14th century, but that the large population size was not an important factor in the kind of technological advancements that resulted in the Industrial Revolution. Early technological advancements depended on \"learning by doing\" (where population size was an important factor, as advances could spread over a large political unit), whereas the Industrial Revolution was the result of experimentation and theory (where population size is less important.\n\nA number of economists have argued that representative government was a factor in the Great Divergence. The argue that absolutist governments, where rulers are not broadly accountable, are bad for property rights and innovation, and that they are prone to corruption and rent-seeking. Representative governments however were accountable to broader segments of the population and thus had to protect property rights and not rule in arbitrary ways, which caused economic prosperity.\n\nA 2017 study in the \"American Economic Review\" found that \"globalization was the major driver of the economic divergence between the rich and the poor portions of the world in the years 1850-1900.\" The states that benefited from globalization were \"characterised by strong constraints on executive power, a distinct feature of the institutional environment that has been demonstrated to favour private investment.\"\n\nA number of economic historians have posited that the Industrial Revolution may have partly occurred where and when it did due to luck and chance.\n\nThe Old World methods of agriculture and production could only sustain certain lifestyles. Industrialization dramatically changed the European economy and allowed it to attain much higher levels of wealth and productivity than the other Old World cores. Although Western technology later spread to the East, differences in uses preserved the Western lead and accelerated the Great Divergence.\n\nWhen analyzing comparative use-efficiency, the economic concept of total factor productivity (TFP) is applied to quantify differences between countries. TFP analysis controls for differences in energy and raw material inputs across countries and is then used to calculate productivity. The difference in productivity levels, therefore, reflects efficiency of energy and raw materials use rather than the raw materials themselves. TFP analysis has shown that Western countries had higher TFP levels on average in the 19th century than Eastern countries such as India or China, showing that Western productivity had surpassed the East.\n\nSome of the most striking evidence for the Great Divergence comes from data on per capita income. The West's rise to power directly coincides with per capita income in the West surpassing that in the East. This change can be attributed largely to the mass transit technologies, such as railroads and steamboats, that the West developed in the 19th century. The construction of large ships, trains, and railroads greatly increased productivity. These modes of transport made moving large quantities of coal, corn, grain, livestock and other goods across countries more efficient, greatly reducing transportation costs. These differences allowed Western productivity to exceed that of other regions.\n\nEconomic historian Paul Bairoch has estimated the GDP per capita of several major countries in 1960 US dollars after the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century, as shown below.\n\nHis estimates show that the GDP per capita of Western European countries rose rapidly after industrialization.\n\nFor the 18th century, and in comparison to non-European regions, Bairoch in 1995 stated that, in the mid-18th century, \"the average standard of living in Europe was a little bit lower than that of the rest of the world.\"\n\nBefore and during the early 19th century, much of continental European agriculture was underdeveloped compared to Asian Cores and England. This left Europe with abundant idle natural resources. England, on the other hand, had reached the limit of its agricultural productivity well before the beginning of the 19th century. Rather than taking the costly route of improving soil fertility, the English increased labor productivity by industrializing agriculture. From 1750 to 1850, European nations experienced population booms; however, European agriculture was barely able to keep pace with the dietary needs. Imports from the Americas, and the reduced caloric intake required by industrial workers compared to farmers allowed England to cope with the food shortages. By the turn of the 19th century, much European farmland had been eroded and depleted of nutrients. Fortunately, through improved farming techniques, the import of fertilizers, and reforestation, Europeans were able to recondition their soil and prevent food shortages from hampering industrialization. Meanwhile, many other formerly hegemonic areas of the world were struggling to feed themselves – notably China.\n\nThe global demand for wood, a major resource required for industrial growth and development, was increasing in the first half of the 19th century. A lack of interest of silviculture in Western Europe, and a lack of forested land, caused wood shortages. By the mid-19th century, forests accounted for less than 15% of land use in most Western European countries. Fuel costs rose sharply in these countries throughout the 18th century and many households and factories were forced to ration their usage, and eventually adopt forest conservation policies. It was not until the 19th century that coal began providing much needed relief to the European energy shortage. China had not begun to use coal on a large scale until around 1900, giving Europe a huge lead on modern energy production.\n\nThrough the 19th century, Europe had vast amounts of unused arable land with adequate water sources. However, this was not the case in China; most idle lands suffered from a lack of water supply, so forests had to be cultivated. Since the mid-19th century, northern China's water supplies have been declining, reducing its agricultural output. By growing cotton for textiles, rather than importing, China exacerbated its water shortage.\nDuring the 19th century, supplies of wood and land decreased considerably, greatly slowing growth of Chinese per capita incomes.\n\nDuring the era of European imperialism, periphery countries were often set up as specialized producers of specific resources. Although these specializations brought the periphery countries temporary economic benefit, the overall effect inhibited the industrial development of periphery territories. Cheaper resources for core countries through trade deals with specialized periphery countries allowed the core countries to advance at a much greater pace, both economically and industrially, than the rest of the world.\n\nEurope's access to a larger quantity of raw materials and a larger market to sell its manufactured goods gave it a distinct advantage through the 19th century. In order to further industrialize, it was imperative for the developing core areas to acquire resources from less densely populated areas, since they lacked the lands required to supply these resources themselves. Europe was able to trade manufactured goods to their colonies, including the Americas, for raw materials. The same sort of trading could be seen throughout regions in China and Asia, but colonization brought a distinct advantage to the West. As these sources of raw materials began to proto-industrialize, they would turn to import substitution, depriving the hegemonic nations of a market for their manufactured goods. Since European nations had control over their colonies, they were able to prevent this from happening. Britain was able to use import substitution to its benefit when dealing with textiles from India. Through industrialization, Britain was able to increase cotton productivity enough to make it lucrative for domestic production, and overtake India as the world's leading cotton supplier. Although Britain had limited cotton imports to protect its own industries, they allowed cheap British products into colonial India from the early 19th century. The colonial administration failed to promote Indian industry, preferring to export raw materials.\n\nWestern Europe was also able to establish profitable trade with Eastern Europe. Countries such as Prussia, Bohemia and Poland had very little freedom in comparison to the West; forced labor left much of Eastern Europe with little time to work towards proto-industrialization and ample manpower to generate raw materials.\n\nA 2017 study in the \"Quarterly Journal of Economics\" argued, \"medieval European institutions such as guilds, and specific features such as journeymanship, can explain the rise of Europe relative to regions that relied on the transmission of knowledge within closed kinship systems (extended families or clans)\". Guilds and journeymanship were superior for creating and disseminating knowledge, which contributed to the occurrence of the Industrial Revolution in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "181797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181797", "title": "History of Montenegro", "text": "History of Montenegro\n\nThe history of Montenegro begins in the early Middle Ages, into the former Roman province of Dalmatia that forms present-day Montenegro. In the 9th century, there were three principalities on the territory of Montenegro: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half, Travunia, the west, and Rascia, the north. In 1042, Stefan Vojislav led a revolt that resulted in the independence of Duklja and the establishment of the Vojislavljević dynasty. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, Mihailo (1046–81), and his grandson Bodin (1081–1101). By the 13th century, \"Zeta\" had replaced \"Duklja\" when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro (Zeta) came under the rule of the Balšić noble family, then the Crnojević noble family, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as \"Crna Gora\" (Venetian: \"\"). Large portions fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1496 to 1878. Parts were controlled by Venice. From 1515 until 1851 the prince-bishops (vladikas) of Cetinje were the rulers. The House of Petrović-Njegoš ruled until 1918. From 1918, it was a part of Yugoslavia. On the basis of an independence referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegro declared independence on 3 June of that year.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Slavonic peoples in the Balkans during the 6th century AD, the area now known as Montenegro was inhabited principally by the Illyrians.\nDuring the Bronze Age, the Illirii, probably the southernmost Illyrian tribe of that time, that gave their name to the entire group were living near Skadar lake on the border of Albania and Montenegro and neighboring with the Greek tribes south. Along the seaboard of the Adriatic, the movement of peoples that was typical of the ancient Mediterranean world ensured the settlement of a mixture of colonists, traders, and those in search of territorial conquest. Substantial Greek colonies were established on the 6th and 7th centuries BC and Celts are known to have settled there in the 4th century BC. During the 3rd century BC, an indigenous Illyrian kingdom emerged with its capital at Scutari. The Romans mounted several punitive expeditions against local pirates and finally conquered this Illyrian kingdom in the 2nd century BC, annexing it to the province of Illyricum.\n\nThe division of the Roman Empire between Roman and Byzantine rule – and subsequently between the Latin and Greek churches – was marked by a line that ran northward from Shkodra through modern Montenegro, symbolizing the status of this region as a perpetual marginal zone between the economic, cultural, and political worlds of the Mediterranean peoples. As Roman power declined, this part of the Dalmatian coast suffered from intermittent ravages by various semi-nomadic invaders, especially the Goths in the late 5th century and the Avars during the 6th century. These soon were supplanted by the Slavs, who became widely established in Dalmatia by the middle of the 7th century. Because the terrain was extremely rugged and lacked any major sources of wealth such as mineral riches, the area that is now Montenegro became a haven for residual groups of earlier settlers, including some tribes who had escaped Romanisation.\n\nIn the second half of the 6th century, Slavs migrated from the Bay of Kotor to the River of Bojana and the hinterland of it as well as surround the Skadar lake. They formed the Principality of Doclea. Under the following missions of Cyril and Methodus, the population was Christianised. The Slavic tribes organised into a semi-independent dukedom of Duklja (Doclea) by the 9th century.\n\nAfter facing subsequent Bulgarian domination, the people were split as the Doclean brother-archonts split the lands among each other after 900. Prince Časlav Klonimirović of the Serbian Vlastimirović dynasty extended his influence over Doclea in the 10th century. After the fall of the Serbian Realm in 960, the Docleans faced a renewed Byzantine occupation through to the 11th century. The local ruler, Jovan Vladimir Dukljanski, whose cult still remains in the Orthodox Christian tradition, was at the time struggling to ensure independence.\n\nStefan Vojislav started an uprising against the Byzantine domination and gained a huge victory against the army of several Byzantine strategs in Tudjemili (Bar) in 1042, which put to an end the Byzantine influence over the Doclea. In the 1054 Great Schism, the Doclea fell on the side of the Catholic Church. Bar became a Bishopric in 1067. In 1077, Pope Gregory VII recognised Duklja as an independent state, acknowledging its King Mihailo (Michael, of the Vojislavljević dynasty founded by nobleman Stefan Vojislav) as Rex Doclea (King of Duklja). Later on Mihailo sent his troops, led by his son Bodin, in 1072 to assist the uprising of Slavs in Macedonia. In 1082, after numerous pleas the Bar Bishopric of Bar was upgraded to an Archbishopric.\n\nThe expansions of the Kings of the Vojislavljević dynasty led to the control over the other Slavic lands, including Zahumlje, Bosnia and Rascia. The might of the Doclea declined and they generally became subjected to the Grand Princes of Rascia in the 12th century. Stefan Nemanja was born in 1117 in Ribnica (today Podgorica). In 1168, as the Serbian Grand Zhupan, Stefan Nemanja took Doclea.\n\nThe region of Duklja (Zeta) was ruled by the Nemanjić dinasty from c. 1186 until c. 1360.\n\nThe Principality of Zeta was ruled by the house of Balšić from c. 1356 until 1421.\n\nAfter the death of Balša III, last representative of House of Balšić, Zeta joined the Serbian Despotate in 1421.\n\nThe Principality of Zeta was ruled by the house of Crnojević Dynasty from c. 1451 until 1496.\n\nAfter the dramatic fall of the Western Roman Empire (476), the romanised Illyrians of the coast of Dalmatia survived the barbarian invasions of the Avars in the 6th century and were only nominally under the influence of the Slavs in the 7th and 8th centuries. In the last centuries of the first millennium, these Romanised Illyrians started to develop their own neo-Latin language, called Dalmatian language, around their small coastal villages that were growing with maritime commerce.\nVenice started to take control of the southern Dalmatia around the 10th century, quickly assimilating the Dalmatian language with Venetian. By the 14th century the Republic of Venice was able to create a territorial continuity around the Bay of Kotor (Cattaro).\n\nThe Republic of Venice dominated the coasts of today's Montenegro from 1420 to 1797. In those four centuries the area around the Cattaro (Kotor) became part of Venetian Albania.\n\nPart of today's Montenegro (the Ottoman Montenegro), called Sandžak, was under Ottoman control from 1498 to 1912, while coastal Montenegro was under Venetian control and the rest of Montenegro was independent from 1516, when \"Vladika\" Vavila was elected as ruler of Montenegro by its clans, and it became a theocratic state. Only small town centers were controlled by Ottomans, but mountains and rural area were de facto independent and controlled by several Montenegrin clans, which were warrior societies.\n\nMontenegrin people were divided in clans (\"Pleme\"). Every adult male from clan was a warrior and took part in wars. Clans were ruled by chieftains, who also were military leaders of a clan. All clan leaders met up several times a year on \"Zbor\" (assembly) in Cetinje, the Montenegrin capital, to make important decisions for the nation, to solve blood feuds and to declare wars.\n\nIndependent Montenegro of that time was divided in three parts:\n\n- Old Montenegro, which had territory of modern-day towns of Cetinje and part of Danilovgrad. It was core of Montenegro and Cetinje was the capital. Montenegrin Prince-Bishops (Vladikas) lived and ruled from Cetinje.\n\n- Brda (\"The Hills\") included territories of northeastern Montenegro. This area was also known as \"The Seven Hills\" (Sedam Brda) because it was inhabited by seven Montenegrin clans: Vasojevići, Bjelopavlići, Piperi, Kuči, Bratonožići, Morača and Rovca. The clans were led by Vojvodas (dukes), either elective or hereditary ones.\n\n- Old Herzegovina, an area in west Montenegro which was part of the short-lived medieval state of Herzegovina.\n\nIn 1514, the Ottoman-controlled territory of Montenegro was proclaimed as a separate Sanjak of Montenegro, by the order of Sultan Beyazid II. The first Sanjak-beg (governor) who was chosen was Ivan Crnojević's son Staniša (Skenderbeg Crnojević), who converted to Islam, and governed until 1528. Despite Skenderbeg's emphasized cruelty, the Ottomans did not have real power in Montenegro. \"Vladika\" Vavil was elected in 1516 as Montenegrin prince-bishop by the Montenegrin people. \nFor 180 years after their first appointment, the Vladikas were elected by the clans and people — an arrangement which was ultimately abandoned in favour of the hereditary system in 1696. For most of this period the Montenegrin people were in constant struggle for existence against Ottoman Empire.\n\nA pretender to Montenegrin throne, one of the Crnojević family who had converted to Islam, invaded Montenegro just as Staniša, thirty years before, and with the same result. Vukotić, the civil governor, repulsed the attack of Turks. Montenegrins, encouraged by the victory, besieged Jajce in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Hungarian garrison was closely hemmed in by the Ottoman army. The Turks were too much occupied with the Hungarian war to take revenge. The next Ottoman invasion of Montenegro took place in 1570.\n\nThe national historians are silent upon the subject of the Haraç (tax in Ottoman Empire), which the invaders are said to have exacted from the inhabitants of the free mountains. The refusal of high-spirited Montenegrin clans to pay tax any longer may have been the cause of the Pasha's invasion during the reign of Bishop Rufim, when the Turks were driven back with heavy loss in Battle of Lješkopolje in 1604. About 1500 Montenegrin warriors attacked the Turkish camp on Lješkopolje field during the night, which counted 10.000 Ottoman soldiers. \n\nIn 1613 Arslan Pasha gathered army of over 40.000 men to attack part of Old Montenegro. Ottoman soldiers were twice as numerous as whole population of Old Montenegro. On 10 September the Montenegrins met the Turkish army, on the same spot Skenderbeg Crnojević was defeated nearly a century ago . The Montenegrins, although assisted by some neighbouring tribes, counted 4000 and were completely outnumbered. But their valour and prowess were out of proportion to their numbers. The Turks suffered a disastrous defeat. Arslan Pasha was wounded, and the heads of his second-in-command and a hundred other Turkish officers were carried off and stuck on the ramparts of Cetinje. The Ottoman troops retreated in disorder; many were drowned in the waters of the Morača, many more killed by Montenegrin pursuers.\n\nMuch light is thrown upon the condition of Montenegro at this period and the causes of its invariable success in war even against fearful odds are explained by the accounts of a contemporary writer, Mariano Bolizza. This author, a patrician of Venice, residing at Kotor in the early part of the seventeenth century, spent a considerable time in the Old Montenegro, and published in 1614 a description of Cetinje. At that time the whole male population of Cetinje available for war consisted of 8,027 persons, distributed among the ninety-three villages which it contained. But these few warriors were continually practising. The rapidity of their maneuvers was extraordinary, and for guerilla warfare they were among Europe's best.\n\nThe condition of the country at this period was naturally unsettled. War was the chief occupation of its inhabitants from sheer necessity, and the arts of peace languished. The printing-press, so active a century earlier, had ceased to exist ; the control of the Prince-Bishop over the five nahie, or districts, which then composed the principality, was weak; the capital itself was a mere village of a few houses. Still, even then, there was a system of local government. Each nahia was divided into tribes, or plemena, each presided over by a headman or kniez, who acted as a judge in disputes between the clansmen.\n\nPetar Petrović Njegoš perhaps the most influential \"vladika\", reigned in the first half of the 19th century. In 1851 Danilo Petrović Njegoš became \"vladika\", but in 1852 he married, threw off his ecclesiastical character, assuming the title of \"knjaz\" (Prince) Danilo I, and transformed his land into a secular principality.\n\nFollowing the assassination of Danilo by Todor Kadić in Kotor, in 1860, the Montenegrins proclaimed Nicholas I as his successor on August 14 of that year. In 1861-1862, Nicholas engaged in an unsuccessful war against the Ottoman Empire with Montenegro holding onto its independence only by the skin of its teeth. \n\nHe was much more successful in 1876. Following the Herzegovinian Uprising, partly initiated by his clandestine activities, he yet again declared war on Turkey. Serbia joined Montenegro, but it was defeated by Turkish forces that same year. Russia now joined in and decisively routed the Turks in 1877-78. The Treaty of San Stefano (March 1878) was highly advantageous to Montenegro, as well as Russia, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria. However, the gains were trimmed somewhat by the Treaty of Berlin (1878). In the end Montenegro was internationally recognized as an independent state, its territory was effectively doubled by the addition of , the port of Bar and all the waters of Montenegro were closed to warships of all nations; and the administration of the maritime and sanitary police on the coast was placed in the hands of Austria. \n\nUnder Nicholas I the country was also granted its first constitution (1905) and was elevated to the rank of kingdom in 1910. During his reign Montenegro was an ally of Russia in the Russo-Japanese war. Montenegrin volunteers were fighting in the Russian Army. In 2006, over 100 years after the end of the war, Japan recognized Montenegrin independence and declared the war being over. A peace treaty was signed.\n\nIn the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), Montenegro did make further territorial gains by splitting Sanjak with Serbia. However, the captured city of Skadar had to be given up to the new state of Albania at the insistence of the Great Powers despite the Montenegrins having invested 10,000 lives for the conquest of the town from the Ottoman-Albanian forces of Essad Pasha Toptani.\n\nMontenegro suffered severely in World War I. Shortly after Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia (28 July 1914), Montenegro lost little time in declaring war on the Central Powers - on Austria-Hungary in the first instance - on 6 August 1914, despite Austrian diplomacy promising to cede Shkoder to Montenegro if it remained neutral. \nFor purposes of coordination in the fight against the enemy army, Serbian General Bozidar Jankovic was named head of High Command of both Serbian and Montenegrin armies. Montenegro received 30 artillery pieces and financial help of 17 million dinars from Serbia. France contributed a colonial detachment of 200 men located in Cetinje at the beginning of war, as well as two radio-stations - located on top of Mount Lovćen and in Podgorica. Until 1915 France supplied Montenegro with necessary war material and food through the port of Bar, which was blockaded by Austrian battleships and submarines. In 1915 Italy took over this role, running supplies unsuccessfully and irregularly across the line Shengjin-Bojana-Lake Skadar, an unsecured route because of constant attacks by Albanian irregulars organised by Austrian agents. Lack of vital materials eventually led Montenegro to surrender.\n\nAustria-Hungary dispatched a separate army to invade Montenegro and to prevent a junction of the Serbian and Montenegrin armies. This force, however, was repulsed, and from the top of the strongly fortified Lovćen, the Montenegrins carried on the bombardment of Kotor held by the enemy. The Austro-Hungarian army managed to capture the town of Pljevlja while on the other hand the Montenegrins took Budva, then under Austrian control. The Serbian victory at the Battle of Cer (15–24 August 1914) diverted enemy forces from Sandjak, and Pljevlja came into Montenegrin hands again. On August 10, 1914, the Montenegrin infantry delivered a strong attack against the Austrian garrisons, but they did not succeed in making good the advantage they first gained. They successfully resisted the Austrians in the second invasion of Serbia (September 1914) and almost succeeded in seizing Sarajevo. With the beginning of the third Austro-Hungarian invasion, however, the Montenegrin army had to retire before greatly superior numbers, and Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German armies finally overran Serbia (December 1915). However, the Serbian army survived, and led by King Peter I of Serbia, started retreating across Albania. In order to support the Serbian retreat, the Montenegrin army, led by Janko Vukotic, engaged in the Battle of Mojkovac (6–7 January 1916). Montenegro also suffered a large scale invasion (January 1916) and for the remainder of the war remained in the possession of the Central Powers. See Serbian Campaign (World War I) for details. The Austrian officer Viktor Weber Edler von Webenau served as the military governor of Montenegro between 1916 and 1917. Afterwards Heinrich Clam-Martinic filled this position.\n\nKing Nicholas fled to Italy (January 1916) and then to France; the government transferred its operations to Bordeaux. Eventually the allies liberated Montenegro from the Austrians. A newly convened National Assembly of Podgorica (\"Podgorička skupština\", \"Подгоричка скупштина\"), accused the Кing of seeking a separate peace with the enemy and consequently deposed him, banned his return and decided that Montenegro should join the Kingdom of Serbia on December 1, 1918. A part of the former Montenegrin military forces still loyal to the King started a rebellion against the amalgamation, the Christmas Uprising (7 January 1919).\n\nIn the period between the two World Wars, Nikola's grandson, King Alexander Karageorgevich dominated the Yugoslav government. In 1922 Montenegro became part of Zeta area and later Zeta Banate.The administrative seat of banate became former Montenegrin capital Cetinje. During this period, Montenegrin people were still divided between politics of Greens and Whites. The dominant political parties in Montenegro were Democratic Party, People's Radical Party, Communist Party of Yugoslavia, Alliance of Agrarians, Montenegrin Federalist Party and Yugoslav Republican Party. During this period, two main problems in Montenegro were lost sovereignty and bad economic situation. All of the parties except Federalists had the same attitude towards the first question, favouring centralism to federalism. The other question was more complex, but the fact on which all of the parties agreed is that the situation was far from good and that the government did nothing to improve the life in area. Devastated by war, Montenegro was never paid the reparations to which it had right as one of the Allies in the Great War. Most of the population lived in rural areas, but the smaller population of citizens had better standards of life. There was no infrastructure and industry was formed of few companies.\n\nDuring World War II, Italy under Benito Mussolini occupied Montenegro in 1941 and annexed to the Kingdom of Italy the area of Kotor (Cattaro), where there was a small Venetian speaking population. (The Queen of Italy - Elena of Montenegro - was daughter of the former king of Montenegro and was born in Cetinje.)\n\nThe English historian Denis Mack Smith wrote that the Queen of Italy (considered the most influential Montenegrin woman in history) convinced her husband the King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III to impose on Mussolini the creation of an independent Montenegro, against the wishes of the fascist Croats and Albanians (who wanted to enlarge their countries with the Montenegrin territories). Her nephew Prince Michael of Montenegro never accepted the offered crown, pledging loyalty to his nephew King Peter II of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe puppet Kingdom of Montenegro was created under fascist control while Krsto Zrnov Popović returned from his exile in Rome in 1941 to attempt to lead the Zelenaši (\"Green\" party), who supported the reinstatement of the Montenegrin monarchy. This militia was called the Lovćen Brigade. Montenegro was ravaged by a terrible guerrilla war, mainly after Nazi Germany replaced the defeated Italians in September 1943.\n\nDuring World War II, as was the case in many other parts of Yugoslavia, Montenegro was involved in some sort of civil war. Besides Montenegrin Greens, the two main factions were the Chetnik Yugoslav army, who swore allegiance to the government in exile and consisted mainly of Montenegrins who declared themselves as Serbs (many of its members were Montenegrin Whites) and Yugoslav Partisans, whose aim was the creation of a Socialist Yugoslavia after the war. Since both factions shared some similarities in their goals, particularly those relating to a unified Yugoslavia and anti-Axis resistance, the two sides joined hands and in 1941 started the 13th July uprising, the first organised uprising in occupied Europe. This occurred just two months after Yugoslavia capitulated, and liberated most of Montenegrin territory, but the rebels were unable to regain control of major towns and cities. After the failed attempts to liberate the towns of Pljevlja and Kolasin, the Italians, reinforced by Germans, recaptured all insurgent territory. At the leadership level, disagreements regarding state policy (Centralist monarchy vs. Federal Socialist republic) eventually led to a split between the two sides; they then became enemies from thereon. Constantly, both factions were trying to gain support among the population. The monarchist Chetniks had influential scholars and revolutionaries among their supporters, such as Blažo Đukanović, Zaharije Ostojić, Radojica Perisic, Petar Baćović, Mirko Lalatovic, and Bajo Stanišić, the hero of the anti-fascist uprising. However, eventually the Chetniks in Montenegro lost support among the population, as did other Chetnik factions within Yugoslavia. The \"de facto\" leader of the Chetniks in Montenegro, Pavle Djurisic, along with other prominent figures of the movement like Dusan Arsovic and Đorđe Lašić, were held responsible for massacres of Muslim population in eastern Bosnia and Sandzak during 1944. Their ideology of a homogeneous Serbia within Yugoslavia proved to be a major obstacle in recruiting liberals, minorities, and Montenegrins who regarded Montenegro as a nation with its own identity. These factors, in addition to the fact that some Chetniks were negotiating with the Axis, led to the Chetnik Yugoslav army losing support among the Allies in 1943. In the same year, Italy, who was until then in charge of the occupied zone, capitulated and was replaced by Germany, and the fighting continued.\n\nPodgorica was liberated by the socialist Partisans on 19 December 1944, and the war of liberation had been won. Josip Broz Tito acknowledged Montenegro's massive contribution to the war against the Axis powers by establishing it as one of the six republics of Yugoslavia.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1992, Montenegro became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; it was the smallest republic in the federation and had the lowest population. Montenegro became economically stronger than ever, since it gained help from federal funds as an under-developed Republic, and it became a tourist destination as well. After war years proved turbulent and were marked by political eliminations. Krsto Zrnov Popović, the leader of Greens was assassinated in 1947, and 10 years later, in 1957, the last Montenegrin Chetnik Vladimir Šipčić was also murdered. During this period Montenegrin Communists such as Veljko Vlahović, Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo, Vladimir Popović and Jovo Kapicić held key positions in the federal government of Yugoslavia. In 1948 Yugoslavia faced the Tito-Stalin split, a period of high tensions between Yugoslavia and the USSR caused by disagreements about each country's influences on its neighbours, and the resolution of Informbiro. Political turmoil began within both the communist party and the nation. Pro-Soviet communists faced prosecution and imprisonment in various prisons across Yugoslavia, notably Goli Otok. Many Montenegrins, due to their traditional allegiance with Russia, declared themselves as Soviet-orientated. This political split in the communist party saw the downfall of many important communist leaders, including Montenegrins Arso Jovanović and Vlado Dapčević. Many of the people imprisoned during this period, regardless of nationality, were innocent - this was later recognised by the Yugoslav government. 1954 saw the expulsion of prominent Montenegrin politician Milovan Đilas from the communist party for criticising party leaders for forming a \"new ruling class\" within, Yugoslavia along with Peko Dapčević.\n\nThrough the second half of the 1940s and the whole of the 1950s, the country underwent infrastructural rejuvenation thanks to federal funding. Montenegro's historic capital Cetinje was replaced with Podgorica, which in the inter-war period became the biggest city in the Republic - although it was practically in ruins due to heavy bombing in the last stages of WW II. Podgorica had a more favorable geographical position within Montenegro, and in 1947 the seat of the Republic was moved to the city, now named Titograd in honor to Marshal Tito. Cetinje received the title of 'hero city' within Yugoslavia. Youth work actions built a railway between the two biggest cities of Titograd and Nikšić, as well as an embankment over Skadar lake linking the capital with the major port of Bar. The port of Bar was also rebuilt after being mined during the German retreat in 1944. Other ports that faced infrastructural improvement were Kotor, Risan and Tivat. In 1947 Jugopetrol Kotor was founded. Montenegro's industrialisation was demonstrated through the founding of the electronic company Obod in Cetinje, a steel mill and Trebjesa brewery in Nikšić, and the Podgorica Aluminium Plant in 1969.\n\nThe breakup of communist Yugoslavia (1991–1992) and the introduction of a multi-party political system found Montenegro with a young leadership that had risen to office only a few years earlier in the late 1980s.\n\nIn effect, three men ran the republic: Milo Đukanović, Momir Bulatović and Svetozar Marović; all swept into power during the anti-bureaucratic revolution — an administrative coup of sorts within the Yugoslav Communist party, orchestrated by younger party members close to Slobodan Milošević.\n\nAll three appeared devout communists on the surface, but they also had sufficient skills and adaptability to understand the dangers of clinging to traditional rigid old-guard tactics in changing times. So when the old Yugoslavia effectively ceased to exist and the multi-party political system replaced it, they quickly repackaged the Montenegrin branch of the old Communist party and renamed it the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS).\n\nThe inheritance of the entire infrastructure, resources and membership of the old Communist party gave the DPS a sizable head start on their opponents in the newly formed parties. It allowed them to win the first multi-party parliamentary election held on 9 and 16 December 1990, and presidential elections held on 9 and 23 December 1990. The party has ruled Montenegro (either alone or as a leading member of different ruling coalitions).\n\nDuring the early-to-mid-1990s Montenegro's leadership gave considerable support to Milošević's war-effort. Montenegrin reservists fought on the Dubrovnik front line, where Prime Minister Milo Đukanović visited them frequently.\n\nIn April 1992, following a referendum, Montenegro decided to join Serbia in forming the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), which officially put the Second Yugoslavia to rest.\n\nDuring the 1991–1995 Bosnian War and Croatian War, Montenegro participated with its police and military forces in the attacks on Dubrovnik, Croatia and Bosnian towns along with Serbian troops, aggressive acts aimed at acquiring more territories by force,\ncharacterized by a consistent pattern of gross and systematic violations of\nhuman rights. Montenegrin General Pavle Strugar has since been convicted for his part in the bombing of Dubrovnik.\nBosnian refugees were arrested by Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Foča, where they were subjected to systematic torture and executed.\n\nIn May 1992, the United Nations imposed an embargo on FRY: this affected many aspects of life in the country.\n\nDue to its favourable geographical location (access to the Adriatic Sea and a water-link to Albania across Lake Skadar) Montenegro became a hub for smuggling activity. The entire Montenegrin industrial production had stopped, and the republic's main economic activity became the smuggling of user goods - especially those in short supply like petrol and cigarettes, both of which skyrocketed in price. It became a \"de facto\" legalized practice and it went on for years. At best, the Montenegrin government turned a blind eye to the illegal activity, but mostly it took an active part in it. Smuggling made millionaires out of all sorts of shady individuals, including senior government officials. Milo Đukanović continues to face actions in various Italian courts over his role in widespread smuggling during the 1990s and in providing safe haven in Montenegro for different Italian Mafia figures who also allegedly took part in the smuggling distribution chain.\n\nIn 1997 a bitter dispute over presidential election results took place. It ended with Milo Đukanović winning over Momir Bulatović in a second-round run-off plagued with irregularities. Nonetheless, the authorities allowed the results to stand. Former close allies had by this time become bitter foes, which resulted in a near-warlike atmosphere in Montenegro for months during the autumn of 1997. It also split the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro. Bulatović and his followers broke away to form the Socialist People's Party of Montenegro (SNP), staying loyal to Milošević, whereas Đukanović began to distance himself from Serbia. This distance from the policies of Milošević played a role in sparing Montenegro from the heavy bombing that Serbia endured in the spring of 1999 during the NATO air-campaign.\n\nĐukanović came out a clear winner from this political fight, as he never lost power for even a day. Bulatović, on the other hand, never held office again in Montenegro after 1997 and eventually retired from politics in 2001.\n\nDuring the Kosovo War, ethnic Albanians took refuge in Montenegro, but were still under threat by Serbian soldiers, who were able to take refugees back into Serbian controlled areas and imprison them.\n\nIn the spring of 1999, at the height of the NATO offensives, 21 Albanians died in several separate and unexplained incidents in Montenegro, according to the republic’s prosecutor. Another group of around 60 Albanian refugees was fired upon in Kaludjerski Laz by Yugoslav Army members, leading to the death of six people, including a woman aged 80 and a child, killed in crossfire that allegedly came from three machine-gun posts of the then Yugoslav Army.\nIn all, 23 Albanians were killed in Kaludjerski Laz, and Montenegrin prosecutors have charged 8 soldiers, among which is Predrag Strugar, son of convicted Montenegrin war criminal General Pavle Strugar, with \"inhuman treatment against civilians\". During the war Montenegro was bombed as part of NATO operations against Yugoslavia, though not as heavily as Serbia. The targets were mostly military ones such as Golubovci Airbase. According to some reports, the airport was attacked because of an operation Yugoslav pilots undertook on 26 April, when they (without knowledge of supreme command) flew over a border into Albania with 4 G-4 Super Galebs and bombed Rinas Airport which housed 24 AH-64 Apache helicopters and parts of 82nd Airborne Division. They ended up with destroying nine Apaches and damaging the rest while also destroying Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) training camps in the vicinity of airport.Eight civilian casualties are reported during the course of the war. During the operation,allegedly 10 aircraft were shot down over Montenegro. The first one was Luftwaffe's Tornado IDS, eventually crashed in Skadar Lake, and the second one was Mirage 2000 of French Air Force, whose pilot catapulted before plane crashed in mountain Rumija. Apparently both planes were shot on 15.04.1999. The rest of them are Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) downed on various locations,including Valdanos, but the only model that has been identified is IAI RQ-5 Hunter, downed in Bay of Kotor on 28 May. However, this has never been confirmed.\n\nIn 2003, after years of wrangling and outside assistance, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia renamed itself as \"Serbia and Montenegro\" and officially reconstituted itself as a loose union. The State Union had a parliament and an army in common, and for three years (until 2006), neither Serbia nor Montenegro held a referendum on the break-up of the union. However, a referendum was announced in Montenegro to decide the future of the republic. The ballots cast in the controversial 2006 independence referendum resulted in a 55.5% victory for independence supporters, just above the 55% borderline mark set by the EU. Montenegro declared independence on 3 June 2006.\n\nFor 16 October 2016, the day of the parliamentary election, a coup d'état against the government of Milo Đukanović had been prepared, according to the Montenegrin Special Prosecutor. Fourteen people, including two Russian nationals and two Montenegrin opposition leaders, Andrija Mandić and Milan Knežević, were indicted for their alleged roles in the coup attempt on charges such as \"preparing a conspiracy against the constitutional order and the security of Montenegro\" and an \"attempted terrorist act.\"\n\nIn June 2017, Montenegro formally became a member of NATO, an eventuality that had been rejected by about half of the country's population and had triggered a promise of retaliatory actions on the part of Russia's government.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "184483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184483", "title": "Intentionality", "text": "Intentionality\n\nIntentionality is a philosophical concept and is defined by the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" as \"the power of minds to be about, to represent, or to stand for, things, properties and states of affairs\". The once obsolete term dates from medieval scholastic philosophy, but in more recent times it has been resurrected by Franz Brentano and adopted by Edmund Husserl. The earliest theory of intentionality is associated with St. Anselm's ontological argument for the existence of God, and with his tenets distinguishing between objects that exist in the understanding and objects that exist in reality.\n\nThe concept of intentionality was reintroduced in 19th-century contemporary philosophy by Franz Brentano (a German philosopher and psychologist who is generally regarded as the founder of act psychology, also called intentionalism) in his work \"Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint\" (1874). Brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of consciousness that are thus \"psychical\" or \"mental\" phenomena, by which they may be set apart from \"physical\" or \"natural\" phenomena.\nBrentano coined the expression \"intentional inexistence\" to indicate the peculiar ontological status of the contents of mental phenomena. According to some interpreters the \"in-\" of \"in-existence\" is to be read as locative, i.e. as indicating that \"an intended object ... exists in or has \"in-existence\", existing not externally but in the psychological state\" (Jacquette 2004, p. 102), while others are more cautious, stating: \"It is not clear whether in 1874 this ... was intended to carry any ontological commitment\" (Chrudzimski and Smith 2004, p. 205).\n\nA major problem within discourse on intentionality is that participants often fail to make explicit whether or not they use the term to imply concepts such as agency or desire, i.e. whether it involves teleology. Dennett (see below) explicitly invokes teleological concepts in the \"intentional stance\". However, most philosophers use \"intentionality\" to mean something with no teleological import. Thus, a thought of a chair can be about a chair without any implication of an intention or even a belief relating to the chair. For philosophers of language, what is meant by intentionality is largely an issue of how symbols can have meaning. This lack of clarity may underpin some of the differences of view indicated below.\n\nTo bear out further the diversity of sentiment evoked from the notion of intentionality, Husserl followed on Brentano, and gave the concept of intentionality more widespread attention, both in continental and analytic philosophy. In contrast to Brentano's view, French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre (\"Being and Nothingness\") identified intentionality with consciousness, stating that the two were indistinguishable. German philosopher Martin Heidegger (\"Being and Time\"), defined intentionality as \"care\" (\"Sorge\"), a sentient condition where an individual's existence, facticity, and being in the world identifies their ontological significance, in contrast to that which is merely ontic (\"thinghood\").\n\nOther 20th-century philosophers such as Gilbert Ryle and A.J. Ayer were critical of Husserl's concept of intentionality and his many layers of consciousness. Ryle insisted that perceiving is not a process, and Ayer that describing one's knowledge is not to describe mental processes. The effect of these positions is that consciousness is so fully intentional that the mental act has been emptied of all content, and that the idea of pure consciousness is that it is nothing. (Sartre also referred to \"consciousness\" as \"nothing\").\n\nPlatonist Roderick Chisholm has revived the Brentano thesis through linguistic analysis, distinguishing two parts to Brentano's concept, the ontological aspect and the psychological aspect. Chisholm's writings have attempted to summarize the suitable and unsuitable criteria of the concept since the Scholastics, arriving at a criterion of intentionality identified by the two aspects of Brentano's thesis and defined by the logical properties that distinguish language describing psychological phenomena from language describing non-psychological phenomena. Chisholm's criteria for the intentional use of sentences are: existence independence, truth-value indifference, and referential opacity.\n\nIn current artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind, intentionality is sometimes linked with questions of semantic inference, with both skeptical and supportive adherents. John Searle argued for this position with the Chinese room thought experiment, according to which no syntactic operations that occurred in a computer would provide it with semantic content. Others are more skeptical of the human ability to make such an assertion, arguing that the kind of intentionality that emerges from self-organizing networks of automata will always be undecidable because it will never be possible to make our subjective introspective experience of intentionality and decision making coincide with our objective observation of the behavior of a self-organizing machine.\n\nDaniel Dennett offers a taxonomy of the current theories about intentionality in Chapter 10 of his book \"The Intentional Stance\". Most, if not all, current theories on intentionality accept Brentano's thesis of the irreducibility of intentional idiom. From this thesis the following positions emerge:\n\nRoderick Chisholm (1956), G.E.M. Anscombe (1957), Peter Geach (1957), and Charles Taylor (1964) all adhere to the former position, namely that intentional idiom is problematic and cannot be integrated with the natural sciences. Members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects, which may imply some kind of dualism (though this is debatable).\n\nThe latter position, which maintains the unity of intentionality with the natural sciences, is further divided into three standpoints:\n\nProponents of the eliminative materialism, understand intentional idiom, such as \"belief\", \"desire\", and the like, to be replaceable either with behavioristic language (e.g. Quine) or with the language of neuroscience (e.g. Churchland).\n\nHolders of realism argue that there is a deeper fact of the matter to both translation and belief attribution. In other words, manuals for translating one language into another cannot be set up in different yet behaviorally identical ways and ontologically there are intentional objects. Famously, Fodor has attempted to ground such realist claims about intentionality in a language of thought. Dennett comments on this issue, Fodor \"attempt[s] to make these irreducible realities acceptable to the physical sciences by grounding them (somehow) in the 'syntax' of a system of physically realized mental representations\" (Dennett 1987, 345).\n\nThose who adhere to the so-called Quinean double standard (namely that \"ontologically there is nothing intentional, but that the language of intentionality is indispensable\"), accept Quine's thesis of the indeterminacy of radical translation and its implications, while the other positions so far mentioned do not. As Quine puts it, indeterminacy of radical translation is the thesis that \"manuals for translating one language into another can be set up in divergent ways, all compatible with the totality of speech dispositions, yet incompatible with one another\" (Quine 1960, 27). Quine (1960) and Wilfrid Sellars (1958) both comment on this intermediary position. One such implication would be that there is, in principle, no deeper fact of the matter that could settle two interpretative strategies on what belief to attribute to a physical system. In other words, the behavior (including speech dispositions) of any physical system, in theory, could be interpreted by two different predictive strategies and both would be equally warranted in their belief attribution. This category can be seen to be a medial position between the realists and the eliminativists since it attempts to blend attributes of both into a theory of intentionality. Dennett, for example, argues in \"True Believers\" (1981) that intentional idiom (or \"folk psychology\") is a predictive strategy and if such a strategy successfully and voluminously predicts the actions of a physical system, then that physical system can be said to have those beliefs attributed to it. Dennett calls this predictive strategy the intentional stance.\n\nThey are further divided into two theses:\n\nAdvocates of the former, the Normative Principle, argue that attributions of intentional idioms to physical systems should be the propositional attitudes that the physical system ought to have in those circumstances (Dennett 1987, 342). However, exponents of this view are still further divided into those who make an Assumption of Rationality and those who adhere to the Principle of Charity. Dennett (1969, 1971, 1975), Cherniak (1981, 1986), and the more recent work of Putnam (1983) recommend the Assumption of Rationality, which unsurprisingly assumes that the physical system in question is rational. Donald Davidson (1967, 1973, 1974, 1985) and Lewis (1974) defend the Principle of Charity.\n\nThe latter is advocated by Grandy (1973) and Stich (1980, 1981, 1983, 1984), who maintain that attributions of intentional idioms to any physical system (e.g. humans, artifacts, non-human animals, etc.) should be the propositional attitude (e.g. \"belief\", \"desire\", etc.) that one would suppose one would have in the same circumstances (Dennett 1987, 343).\n\nWorking on the intentionality of vision, belief, and knowledge, Pierre Le Morvan (2005) has distinguished between three basic kinds of intentionality that he dubs \"transparent\", \"translucent\", and \"opaque\" respectively. The threefold distinction may be explained as follows. Let's call the \"intendum\" what an intentional state is about, and the \"intender\" the subject who is in the intentional state. An intentional state is transparent if it satisfies the following two conditions: (i) it is genuinely relational in that it entails the existence of not just the intender but the intendum as well, and (ii) substitutivity of identicals applies to the intendum (i.e. if the intentional state is about a, and a = b, then the intentional state is about b as well). An intentional state is translucent if it satisfies (i) but not (ii). An intentional state is opaque if it satisfies neither (i) nor (ii).\n\nThe claim that all mental states are intentional is called intentionalism, the contrary being anti-intentionalism.\n\nSome anti-intentionalism, such as that of Ned Block, is based on the argument that phenomenal conscious experience or qualia is also a vital component of consciousness, and that it is not intentional. (The latter claim is itself disputed by Michael Tye.)\n\nAnother form of anti-intentionalism associated with John Searle regards phenomenality itself as the \"mark of the mental\" and sidelines intentionality.\n\nA further form argues that some unusual states of consciousness are non-intentional, although an individual might live a lifetime without experiencing them. Robert K.C. Forman argues that some of the unusual states of consciousness typical of mystical experience are pure consciousness events in which awareness exists, but has no object, is not awareness \"of\" anything.\n\nSeveral authors have attempted to construct philosophical models describing how intentionality relates to the human capacity to be self-conscious. Cedric Evans contributed greatly to the discussion with his \"The Subject of Self-Consciousness\" in 1970. He centered his model on the idea that executive attention need not be propositional in form.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "222788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=222788", "title": "Ishmael", "text": "Ishmael\n\nIshmael, a figure in the Tanakh and the Quran, was Abraham's first son according to Jews, Christians and Muslims. Ishmael was born to Abraham and Sarah's handmaiden Hagar (Hājar) (). According to the Genesis account, he died at the age of 137 ().\n\nThe Book of Genesis and Islamic traditions consider Ishmael to be the ancestor of the Ishmaelites and patriarch of Qaydār. According to Muslim tradition, Ishmael the Patriarch and his mother Hagar are buried next to the Kaaba in Mecca.\n\nThe name \"Yishma'el\" existed in \"various ancient Semitic cultures\", including early Babylonian and Minæan. It is a theophoric name translated literally as \"God (El) has hearkened\", suggesting that \"a child so named was regarded as the fulfillment of a divine promise\".\n\n\"This is the account of Ishmael from \"\n\nIn , the birth of Ishmael was planned by the Patriarch Abraham's first wife, who at that time was known as Sarai. She and her husband Abram (Abraham) sought a way to have children in order to fulfill the Abrahamic covenant that was established in . Sarai was 75 years old and had yet to bear Abraham a child. She had the idea to offer her Egyptian handmaiden Hagar to her husband, so that they could have a child by her. Abraham took Hagar as his wife, and conceived a child with her.\n\nHagar began to show contempt for Sarah, who responded by treating her harshly. Hagar then fled into the desert region between Abraham's settlement and Shur. describes the naming of Ishmael, and God's promise to Hagar concerning Ishmael and his descendants. This occurred at the well of Beer-lahai-roi, where Hagar encountered an angel of God, who said to her \"Behold, you are with child / And shall bear a son; / You shall call him Ishmael, / For the Lord has paid heed to your suffering.\" Abraham was blessed so that his descendants would be as numerous as the dust of the earth. God would make of Ishmael a great nation, because he was of the seed of Abraham. However, God told Hagar that her son would be a \"wild ass (donkey) of a man\" (Genesis 16:12), living in conflict with his relatives. When Ishmael was born, Abraham was 86 years old.\n\nWhen he was 13 years old, Ishmael was circumcised at the same time as all other males in Abraham's household, becoming a part of the covenant in a mass circumcision. His father Abram, given the new name \"Abraham,\" then 99, was circumcised along with the others ().\n\nAt the time of the covenant, God informed Abraham that his wife Sarah would give birth to a son, whom he was instructed to name Isaac. God told Abraham that He would establish his covenant through Isaac, and when Abraham inquired as to Ishmael's role, God answered that Ishmael has been blessed and that He \"will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.\" (). God also mentioned that \"He will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand will be over everyone, And everyone's hand will be against him; And he will live to the east of all his brothers.\"().\n\nA year later, Ishmael's half-brother Isaac was born to Abraham by his first wife Sarah when she was 90 years old (), after she had ceased showing any signs of fertility ().\n\nOn the day of feasting during which Abraham celebrated the weaning of Isaac, Ishmael was \"mocking\" or \"playing with\" Isaac (the Hebrew word מְצַחֵֽק \"meṣaḥeq\" is ambiguous) and Sarah asked Abraham to expel Ishmael and his mother, saying: \"Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.\" Her demand was painful for Abraham, who loved Hagar and Ishmael. Abraham agreed only after God told him that \"in Isaac your seed shall be called\", and that God would \"make a nation of the son of the bondwoman\" Ishmael, since he was a descendant of Abraham (), God having previously told Abraham \"I will establish My covenant with [Isaac],\" while also making promises concerning the Ishmaelite nation ().\n\nAt the age of 14, Ishmael was freed along with his mother. The Lord's covenant made clear Ishmael was not to inherit Abraham's house and that Isaac would be the seed of the covenant: \"Take your son, your only son, whom you love and go to the region of Moriah.\" (Genesis )\nAbraham gave Ishmael and his mother a supply of bread and water and sent them away. Hagar entered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba where the two soon ran out of water and Hagar, not wanting to witness the death of her son, set the boy some distance away from herself, and wept. \"And God heard the voice of the lad\" and sent his angel to tell Hagar, \"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.\" And God \"opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water\", from which she drew to save Ishmael's life and her own. \"And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.\" ()\n\nAfter roaming the wilderness for some time, Ishmael and his mother settled in the Desert of Paran, where he became an expert in archery. Eventually, his mother found him a wife from the land of Egypt. They had twelve sons who each became tribal chiefs throughout the regions from Havilah to Shur (from Assyria to the border of Egypt). His sons were:\n\nIshmael also had one known daughter, Mahalath or Basemath, the third wife of Esau.\n\nIshmael appeared with Isaac at the burial of Abraham. Ishmael died at the age of 137.\n\nHistorians and academics in the fields of linguistics and source criticism believe that the stories of Ishmael belong to the three strata of J, or Yahwist source, the P, or Priestly source, and the E, or Elohist source (See Documentary hypothesis). For example, the narration in is of J type and the narration in is of E type.\n\nJewish and Islamic traditions consider Ishmael to be the ancestor of Arab people.\n\nSome Pre-Islamic poetry mentions Ishmael, his father Abraham, and the sacrifice story, such as the Pre-Islamic poet \"Umayyah Ibn Abi As-Salt\", who said in one of his poems: بكره لم يكن ليصبر عنه أو يراه في معشر أقتال ([The sacrifice] of his first-born of whose separation he [Abraham] could not bear neither could he see him surrounded in foes).\n\n\"Zayd ibn Amr\" was another Pre-Islamic figure who refused idolatry and preached monotheism, claiming it was the original belief of their [Arabs] father Ishmael.\n\nAlso, some of the tribes of Central West Arabia called themselves the \"people of Abraham and the offspring of Ishmael\", as evidenced by a common opening of speeches and harangues of reconciliation between rival tribes in that area.\n\nIn Rabbinic Judaism, Ishmael has generally been viewed as wicked, though repentant. According to the Book of Genesis, in the Hebrew Bible, Isaac rather than Ishmael was the true heir of the Abrahamic tradition and covenant.\n\nIn some Rabbinic traditions Ishmael is said to have had two wives; one of them named Aisha. This name corresponds to the Muslim tradition for the name of Muhammad's wife. This is understood as a metaphoric representation of the Muslim world (first Arabs and then Turks) with Ishmael.\n\nRabbinical commentators in the Midrash Genesis Rabbah also say that Ishmael's mother Hagar was the Pharaoh's daughter, thereby making Ishmael the grandson of the Pharaoh. This could be why Genesis 17:20 refers to Ishmael as the father of 12 mighty princes. According to Genesis 21:21, Hagar married Ishmael to an Egyptian woman, and if Rabbinical commentators are correct about Hagar being the daughter of the Pharaoh, his marriage to a woman selected by the Pharaoh's daughter could explain how and why his sons became princes.\n\nHowever, according to other Jewish commentators, Ishmael's mother Hagar is identified with Keturah, the woman Abraham married after the death of Sarah, stating that Abraham sought her out after Sarah's death. It is suggested that Keturah was Hagar's personal name, and that \"Hagar\" was a descriptive label meaning \"stranger\". This interpretation is discussed in the Midrash and is supported by Rashi, Gur Aryeh, Keli Yakar, and Obadiah of Bertinoro. Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Itzhaki) argues that \"Keturah\" was a name given to Hagar because her deeds were as beautiful as incense (Hebrew, \"ketoret\"), and that she remained chaste (literally \"tied her opening\", with the verb \"tied\" in Aramaic being \"k-t-r\") from the time she was separated from Abraham.\n\nIt is also said that Sarah was motivated by Ishmael's sexually frivolous ways because of the reference to his \"making merry\" (Gen. 21:9), a translation of the Hebrew word \"Mitzachek\". This was developed into a reference to idolatry, sexual immorality or even murder; some rabbinic sources claim that Sarah worried that Ishmael would negatively influence Isaac, or that he would demand Isaac's inheritance on the grounds of being the firstborn. Regarding the word \"Mitzachek\" (again in Gen. 21:9) The Jewish Study Bible by Oxford University Press says this word in this particular context is associated with; \"Playing is another pun on Isaac's name (cf. 17.17; 18.12; 19.14; 26.8). Ishmael was 'Isaacing', or 'taking Isaac's place'.\" Also others take a more positive view, emphasizing Hagar's piety, noting that she was \"the one who had sat by the well and besought him who is the life of the worlds, saying 'look upon my misery'\".\n\nIshmael is recognized as an important prophet and patriarch of Islam. Muslims believe that Ishmael was the firstborn of Abraham, born to him from his second wife Hagar. Ishmael is recognized by Muslims as the ancestor of several prominent Arab tribes and being the forefather of Muhammad. Muslims also believe that Muhammad was the descendant of Ishmael that would establish a great nation, as promised by God in the Old Testament.\nIshmael is mentioned over ten times in the Quran, often alongside other patriarchs and prophets of ancient times. Ishmael is mentioned together with Elisha and Dhul-Kifl as one of \"the patiently enduring and righteous, whom God caused to enter into his mercy.\" It is also said of Lot, Elisha, Jonah and Ishmael, that God gave each one \"preference above the worlds\". These references to Ishmael are, in each case, part of a larger context in which other holy prophets are mentioned. In other chapters of the Quran, however, which date from the Medina period, Ishmael is mentioned closely with his father Abraham: Ishmael stands alongside Abraham in their attempt to set up the Kaaba in Mecca as a place of monotheistic pilgrimage and Abraham thanks God for granting him Ishmael and Isaac in his old age. Ishmael is further mentioned alongside the patriarchs who had been given revelations and Jacob's sons promised to follow the faith of their forefathers, \"Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac\", when testifying their faith. In the narrative of the near-sacrifice of Abraham's son, the son is not named and, although the general interpretation is that it was Ishmael, Tabari maintained that it was Isaac. Most modern commentators, however, regard the son's identification as least important in a narrative which is given for its moral lesson.\n\nThe commentaries on the Quran and the numerous collections of \"Stories of the Prophets\" flesh out the Islamic perspective of Ishmael and detail what they describe as his integral part in setting up the Kaaba. According to Muslim tradition, Ishmael was buried at the Hijr near the Kaaba, inside the Sacred Mosque.\n\nIn Islamic belief, Abraham had prayed to God for a son and God heard his prayer. Muslim exegesis states that Sarah asked Abraham to marry her Egyptian handmaiden Hagar because she herself was barren. Hagar soon bore Ishmael, who was the first son of Abraham. God then instructed Abraham to take his wife Hagar and their baby Ishmael out in to the desert and to leave them there. He did so taking them to the location of the Kaaba's foundations (which now was in ruins) and as he turned away from Hagar and started to walk away she called out to him and asked \"Why are you leaving us here?\" to which Abraham didn't reply the first two times she asked. She then changed her question and asked \"Did God command you to do this?\" to which Abraham stopped, turned around, looked back and replied \"Yes.\" and she responded \"Then God will provide for us.\" Abraham then continued on his return journey back to Sarah. In the desert, the baby Ishmael cried with thirst. His mother placed him in the shade under a bush and went in a frantic search for water, which resulted in her running seven times between the Safa and Marwah hills trying to find a source of water or a passing caravan who she could trade with for water. Hagar, not finding any sources of water and fearing the death of her baby, sat down and cried asking for God's help. God sent angel Gabriel to her informing her to lift up her baby and when she did, she noticed that his feet had scratched the ground allowing a spring of water to bubble up to the surface. Hagar quickly shifted the ground to form a well around the spring to contain the water forming the Zamzam well. Hagar refilled the bottle with water and gave her baby a drink. This spring became known to caravans that traveled through Arabia and Hagar negotiated deals with them for supplies in exchange for the water. From her actions, the city of Mecca (originally Becca or Baca in Hebrew) grew, and attracted settlers who stayed and provided protection for her and Ishmael as well as being sources of various goods brought in and exchanged with visiting caravans. To commemorate the blessing of the Zamzam well which God gave to Hagar and Ishmael, Muslims run between the Safa and Marwah hills retracing Hagar’s steps on her search for water, during the rites of Hajj.\n\nAbraham returned and visited Ishmael at various times throughout his life. At one time, according to a tradition of Muhammad, Abraham had arrived when his son was out and Abraham visited with Ishmael's wife. Abraham decided to leave before seeing his son, but based upon the complaints Ishmael's wife made in response to his questions, he gave her a message to give to her husband when he returned home, which was \"change his threshold.\" When Ishmael arrived that night, he asked if they had had any visitors, and was informed by his wife of the man who had visited and what he said. Ishmael understood his father and explained to his wife that the visitor was his father and he had been instructed to divorce his wife and find a better one, which Ishmael did. Some time after this, Abraham returned to visit Ishmael and again Ishmael was out. Abraham talked with Ishmael's new wife and found her answers indicated faith in God and contentment with her husband. Abraham again had to leave before he saw his son, but left him the message to \"keep his threshold.\" When Ishmael returned that night, he again asked if there had been any visitors and was informed of Abraham’s visit. Ishmael told his wife who it was that had come to visit and that he approved of her and their marriage.\n\nOn one of his visits to Mecca, Abraham is said to have asked his son to help him build the requested Kaaba. Islamic traditions hold that the Kaaba was first built by Adam and that Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the Kaaba on the old foundations. As Ishmael grew up in Arabia, he is said to have become fluent in Arabic. In the genealogical trees that the early scholars drew, Ishmael was considered the ancestor of the Northern Arabs and Muhammad was linked to him through the lineage of the patriarch Adnan. Ishmael may also have been the ancestor of the Southern Arabs through his descendant Qahtan.\n\nIn the book of Galatians (4:21–31), Paul uses the incident to symbolize the two covenants the old but fulfilled and new covenant which is universal by promise through Jesus Christ. In Galatians 4:28–31, Hagar is associated with the Sinai covenant, while Sarah is associated with the covenant of grace into which her son Isaac enters.\n\nThe Bahá'í writings state that it was Ishmael, and not Isaac, who was the son that Abraham almost sacrificed. However, the Bahá'í writings also state that the name is unimportant as either could be used: the importance is that both were symbols of sacrifice. According to Shoghi Effendi, there has also been another Ishmael, a prophet of Israel, commonly known as Samuel.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was also one of the founding fathers of the Tbilisi State University (1918) and its rector from 1919 to 1926.\n\nPrince Ivane Javakhishvili was born in Tbilisi, Georgia (then part of Imperial Russia) to the aristocratic family of Prince Alexander Javakhishvili, who served as an educator at the Tbilisi Gymnasium. Having graduated from the Faculty of Oriental Studies of the St. Petersburg University in 1899, he became a \"privat-docent\" of the Chair of Armenian and Georgian Philology at his alma mater. From 1901 to 1902, he was a visiting scholar at the University of Berlin. In 1902, he accompanied his mentor, Academician Nicholas Marr, to Mount Sinai where they studied medieval Georgian manuscripts. After the first volumes of Javakhishvili's monumental, but yet unfinished, \"kartveli eris istoria\" (A History of the Georgian Nation) appeared between 1908 and 1914, the young scholar quickly established himself as a preeminent authority on Georgian and Caucasian history, Georgian law, paleography, diplomacy, music, drama and other subjects, producing landmark studies in these fields. \n\nEarly in 1918, he was instrumental in founding Georgia's first regular university in Tbilisi, thus realizing a long-time dream cherished by generations of Georgian intellectuals but consistently frustrated by the Imperial Russian authorities. The Tbilisi University (present-day I. Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University, TSU, which now bears his name), of which Javakhishvili became a professor and the head of the Department of the History of Georgia, rapidly assumed a dominant position in Georgia's educational life. In 1919, Javakhishvili succeeded the noted chemist Petre Melikishvili as the second rector of the university: he served until June 1926, when, in the aftermath of anti-Soviet August Uprising of 1924, tolerance of non-Marxist intellectuals began to contract. Although he was permitted to publish and teach, this eclipse probably saved his life, since his successor at the university, was among the victims of the Stalinist Great Purge of 1936–7. He was forced to step down at TSU in 1938, but was soon appointed director of the Department of History at the State Museum of Georgia which he headed until his death in Tbilisi in 1940. He was interred at the yard of the TSU.\n\nJavakhishvili authored more than 170 works dealing with various aspects of Georgia's political, cultural, social and economic history. Since the publication of its first edition in 1908, his main work, \"A History of the Georgian Nation\" (fully published between 1908 and 1949), has remained one of the most comprehensive and eloquent treatments of pre-modern Georgian history. Regrettably, it has not been translated into any other language. Several of Javakhishvili's most influential articles and books including \"A History of the Georgian Nation\" have been reprinted in his twelve-volume collected works from 1977 and 1998.\n\n"}

He served as a Professor of Political Economy of the University of Toronto from 1892 to 1923. His influence upon Canadian economic thought is traced to as late as the 1970s. He played a key role in resettling Doukhobor religious dissidents from the Russian Empire to Canada. He was also a noted arts promoter.\n\nMavor was born in Stranraer, Scotland, to a Free Church of Scotland minister and teacher James Mavor, and Mary Ann Taylor Bridie. He studied in Glasgow University. After that he taught for some time in a Glasgow college and read special courses in Glasgow University and Edinburgh University. He was also an editor for \"Scottish Art Review\". He also became active in the Socialist League, chairing its Scottish district.\n\nIn 1892, upon the recommendation of University of Toronto Professor William Ashley who was leaving for Harvard University, he took Ashley's chair of Political Economy and Constitutional History, moving to Toronto with his family (including daughter Dora who would later become a major figure in Canada's theatre). After 1892, he spent most of his life in Toronto, leaving only for short trips.\n\nIn 1893, James Mavor was a founding member of the Toronto Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi Literary Society.\n\nAt the start, he caused turmoil when he stated Canada could not serve as the only source of wheat for the British Empire as general ideology of the Empire observed it. To avoid further misunderstanding, he took the economy of Russia as his major scientific specialization. As a professor he also researched the economies of Canada, China, Korea, and Japan.\n\nIn 1898 through 1899, he became a key figure in the Doukhobor immigration to Canada. His correspondent at the time was notable Russian scientist and major Anarchist ideologist Kropotkin, at that time living in the UK, who proposed that Doukhobor peasantry, numbering several thousand people, be settled in Canada. Through several years that followed, he took a keen interest in the Doukhobor cause, siding with them in cases of conflict with Canadian authorities.\n\nAs an arts activist, Mavor helped organize several Canadian art venues, such as the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Royal Ontario Museum.\n\nHe published articles and statistics for the Canadian government regarding immigration, wheat production, and workers' healthcare compensation. In 1914, he published the first edition of his \"magnum opus\", \"An Economic History of Russia\", in two volumes. This publication earned him membership in the Royal Society of Canada.\n\nAfter over 30 years of teaching economy, he became professor emeritus and retired in 1923. After he left, the University of Toronto for some time discontinued the tradition of extensive Russian studies he and William Ashley founded.\n\nHe died at the age of 71 in Glasgow, Scotland, during a trip to relatives.\n\nHis grandson is actor Mavor Moore, his great-granddaughters are actresses Charlotte Moore and Tedde Moore, and his great-great-grandson is actor and music producer Noah \"40\" Shebib.\n\n\n"}

Ostlund\n\nJohn Chapman Ostlund (September 29, 1927 – April 27, 2004) was a diversified businessman from Gillette, Wyoming and Cheyenne, Wyoming, who served in the Wyoming State Senate from 1973 to 1978, when he resigned to seek the Republican gubernatorial nomination. As the GOP nominee, he came within 1 percentage point of unseating Democratic Governor Edgar Herschler of Kemmerer in Lincoln County in western Wyoming. Ostlund lost his sight in 1985 because of complications from diabetes. Thereafter, he became an advocate of the blind and penned his memoirs to benefit the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind in Smithtown, New York.\n\nOstlund was the second son born to Axel William Ostlund (1891–1982) and the former Mary Spence \"Polly\" Roberts (1902–1980) in Gillette, the seat of Campbell County in northeastern Wyoming. In 1944, he graduated from Campbell County High School and then entered Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri, which closed in 2002. He received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, from Republican U.S. Senator Frank A. Barrett of Wyoming. He graduated in 1949 with the commission of ensign and served on the destroyer \"Meredith\" in the Mediterranean Sea. The diagnosis of diabetes required him to retire from the Navy in 1950. During a stay at St. Albans Naval Hospital on Long Island, New York, he met the Navy nurse Ensign Mary Virginia Ryan (born 1928). On January 13, 1952, the couple wed in Mount Vernon, New York. They settled in his native Gillette.\nOstlund and his brother, Axel R. \"Bob\" Ostlund, were involved in a multitude of business activities in Gillette: John Deere Farm Machinery, plumbing and heating, sheet metal, banking, and the construction and operation of motels and restaurants. Their interest also reached into manufacturing, real estate, investments, agri-business, and mineral leasing and exploration.\n\nOstlund was chairman of the Campbell County Republican Party from 1961 to 1969. He then served for several years as a state Republican committeeman. In 1969, Governor Stanley K. Hathaway named Ostlund to the board of trustees of the University of Wyoming at Laramie. During his term, UW developed its Fine Arts Center.\n\nIn 1972, Ostlund unseated state Senator Richard A. Mader (1923–2001) of Gillette in the Republican primary to represent Campbell and neighboring Johnson County, which was the site of a notorious range war in the early 1890s. He won the general election in the fall and was reelected in 1976. The 1970s were a time when Wyoming, and particularly Campbell County, were experiencing growth in mineral development. Ostlund, a conservative Republican, was chairman of the Senate Mines, Minerals and Industrial Development Committee and was involved in the development of the Wyoming Community Development Authority, the Coal Tax for Impact Assistance, and the School Foundation Program to finance capital facilities. Ostlund listed his most important accomplishment as the acquisition of the land for the \"Camplex\", the multi-activities center for Campbell County.\n\nIn the spring of 1978, Ostlund resigned from the state Senate to run for governor. In the primary, he polled 40,251 votes (58.9 percent) to defeat Gus Fleischli, a Rawlins native who was in the petroleum business in Cheyenne, who received 24,824 ballots (36.4 percent). In a mostly Democratic year nationally, Ostlund was then defeated in the general election by Herschler: 67,595 votes (49.1 percent) to 69,972 (50.9 percent). Four years earlier as the GOP nominee, trucking executive and former State Senator Dick Jones of Cody in Park County received 56,645 (44.1 percent) to Herschler's 71,741 (55.9 percent). Ostlund hence ran 10,950 votes ahead of Jones, but Jones faced voters in a more heavily Democratic year nationally.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1995, the Ostlunds owned the historic Remount Ranch twenty-three miles west of the capital city of Cheyenne. During the early years, the ranch was a weekend home, but it was a full-time residence for the last eleven years until it was sold. The couple made extensive restorations to the property and hosted civic, educational, and social functions there. By 1985, Ostlund had gradually lost his sight but continued many community activities, including service on the board of the Wells Fargo Bank, the Cheyenne United Medical Center Foundation, the Governor’s Mansion Foundation and the acclaimed Old West Museum in Cheyenne. He was also a member of Cheyenne Rotary International and the Cheyenne Young Men’s Literary Club. In 1995, the Ostlunds relocated to Cheyenne and sold Remount to the Bangert family, which returned it to his previous status as a working ranch.\n\nIn 2001, Ostlund published his autobiography, \"Quite a Life\", which he dedicated to his eight grandchildren. All proceeds from the sale of the book were donated to the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind, the organization from which he obtained his two guide dogs. His most recent dog, Russ, died unexpectedly several weeks before Ostlund's own passing. Ostlund sometimes took his guide dogs into elementary school classrooms to demonstrate how he and the dogs worked as a team to assist him in maintaining his many activities. Despite his handicap, Ostlund maintained many private interests, including playing the piano.\n\nOstlund died at his home in Cheyenne. In addition to his wife and brother, he was survived by his eight children: Peg Ostlund of Cheyenne, John Ostlund, Jr., of Westminster, Colorado; Nancy Essery of San Diego, California; Tom Ostlund of Cheyenne, Karin Ostlund of Denver; Patrick Ostlund of Douglas, Wyoming; Jane Gebhart and Scott Ostlund, both of Gillette. A mass of Christian burial was delivered on May 3, 2004, at St. Matthew's Catholic Church in Gillette.\n"}

Both his paternal grandfather Kadir and maternal grandfather Mehmed were Imams. Bašeskija lost his father Ahmed when he was a child.

Having participated with Michel Foucault and Jean-Marie Domenach in the founding of the \"Groupe d'information sur les prisons\" (GIP), one of the first French new social movements, he criticized negationism. Vidal-Naquet, who never abandoned his fascination with Antiquity, was also a supporter of .\n\nVidal-Naquet's family belonged to the Sephardic Jewish community rooted in the Comtat Venaissin (Carpentras, Avignon). He was born in Paris, and he was raised in bourgeois, Republican and secular environment. His father Lucien was a lawyer, of \"Dreyfusard\" temperament, who quickly entered the Resistance in order to avoid exile. In June 1940, the family moved to Marseille. Arrested by the Gestapo on 15 May 1944, Vidal-Naquet's father was deported, along with his wife, in June 1944. They were sent to Auschwitz, where they died. At 14 years old, Pierre Vidal-Naquet then hid in his grandmother's house in the Drôme. There, he read a lot, including the \"Iliad\", and came to know his cousin, the philosopher Jacques Brunschwig. He later learnt that the Nazis had made \"his father dance,\" something he would never forget.\n\nAfter his studies at the lycée Carnot in Paris, he specialized in the history of Ancient Greece, as well as in contemporary subjects such as the Algerian War (1954–1962) and the Holocaust. He read Marc Bloch's \"Strange Defeat\", a book attempting to explain the causes of the defeat during the 1940 Battle of France, which is one of the origins of his vocation as a historian. He discovered surrealism (André Breton, René Char and also Antonin Artaud), and founded a review at 18 years old, along with Pierre Nora, \"Imprudence\". The 1949 Rajk trial definitively took out his will to adhere to the French Communist Party (PCF).\n\nPierre Vidal-Naquet first taught history at Orléans's high school (1955), before going to Caen's university (1956–60) and then Lille (1961–62). Reading Dumézil and Lévi-Strauss, he would become a member of the \"Paris School\", originally composed of Jean-Pierre Vernant, Nicole Loraux, Marcel Detienne and himself. Their work would renew approaches to the study of Ancient Greece.\n\nHe then worked at the CNRS (1962–64) and was named \"maître de conférences\" at the University of Lyon (1964–66). He was then named professor at the \"École pratique des hautes études\", which became the EHESS.\n\nVidal-Naquet co-authored several books with Jean-Pierre Vernant, with whom he was friends. However, although Vernant was a \"comrade\" of the French Communist Party (PCF), Vidal-Naquet never belonged to any political party, with the exception of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU), which he considered a \"mere discussion circle.\"\n\nPierre Vidal-Naquet was married and the father of three children. He was also officer of the \"Légion d'honneur\" and, in Greece, commander of the Phenix Order.\n\nPierre Vidal-Naquet was an atheist.\n\nPierre Vidal-Naquet defined himself as an \"activist historian\", and while pursuing his studies never ceased engaging in political struggles and taking part in political committees, etc. A member of the Comité Audin, along with Jérôme Lindon (editor of the Minuit publishing house), he was one of the best known opponents of the use of torture by the French Army during the Algerian War (1954–62). Along with Jean-Paul Sartre and 119 others, he signed the \"Manifesto of the 121\", a call for civil disobedience against the Algerian war. As an anti-colonialist, Vidal-Naquet was opposed to Guy Mollet's French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) reformist party because of Mollet's support of the First Indochina War and Algerian War.\n\nHe was also opposed to the Regime of the Colonels (1967–74) in Greece. He supported peace efforts in the Middle East as well as the Europalestine group. He thus declared: \"I consider Sharon a criminal.\"\n\nWith Michel Foucault and Jean-Marie Domenach, on 8 February 1971 he signed the manifesto of the \"Groupe d'informations sur les prisons\", which, rather than speaking in the name of prisoners, aimed to give back to them the chance of speaking in their own voice.\n\nVidal-Naquet was also active in condemning denial of the Armenian Genocide. Vidal-Naquet, who had answered or criticized Holocaust negationist Robert Faurisson in several of his works, once employed Faurisson as an example to illustrate \"what the Armenian minorities might feel\":\n\nLet us imagine a negationist Robert Faurisson as a governmental minister, a Faurisson president of the Republic, a Faurisson general, a Faurisson ambassador, a Faurisson president of the Turkish Historical Commission and a member of the senate of the University of Istanbul, a Faurisson member of the United Nations, a Faurisson responding in the press each time the question of the Jews is raised. In brief, a state-sponsored Faurisson paired with an international Faurisson and, along with all that, a Talaat-Himmler blessed, since 1943, with an official mausoleum in the country's capital.\n\nVidal-Naquet was one of the first scholars to deconstruct historical revisionism, notably in \"The Assassins of Memory\" and \"Reflexions on Genocide\". He was also opposed to the 23 February 2005 French law on colonialism passed by the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), but which was finally repealed by president Jacques Chirac in the beginning of 2006. Vidal-Naquet also criticized the 1990 Gayssot Act which prohibits revisionist discourse, claiming that the law shouldn't interfere in historical matters. Vidal-Naquet's arguments against legislation relating to historical studies is not, however, a door opened to revisionist speech. He once declared that he would rather name revisionists \"negationists\", and that he wouldn't engage with them for \"simple and scientific reasons. An astronomer doesn't debate with an astrologer. I wouldn't discuss with someone who supports the idea that the moon is made of Roquefort ... it is impossible.\"\n\nWhile his analyses e.g. of Greek tragedy and the institution of the Athenian ephebia has been favourably received by many French intellectuals, they have been violently challenged elsewhere, particularly by Italian philologists who, like Vidal-Naquet himself, were favourably inclined towards a Marxist analysis. His structuralist approach has been called ahistorical, his analyses of the texts as lacking in thoroughness and even manipulative, using categories like polysemy and ambiguity which his critics found do not apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its members portray Anglo-Saxon, Viking, Norman and British living history from the period before the Norman Conquest. The society has gained in popularity as a result of being featured in prominent television programmes such as \"Michael Wood on Beowulf\", \"Time Team\" and \"A History of Britain.\n\nIt was founded in 1986 by members formerly of The Norse Film and Pageant Society (which went on to become called \"the Vikings\") and has a large British membership. An unincorporated association, it claims to be one of the largest Early Middle Ages re-enactment societies in the world. The organisation comprises a number of local groups, mostly within the United Kingdom.\n\nRegia Anglorum is an Associate Sponsor of the British Museum, and is a founder member of the National Association of Re-enactment Societies (NAReS) and The Battlefields Trust.\n\nThe most high-profile of Regia Anglorum's activities is the Wychurst Project. On of freeheld land in Kent, the group built a full-scale replica of a defended manorial burgh and the flooded ring ditch and bank surmounted by 220 metres of palisade enclosing an acre of land. The centre of the burgh sits a Longhall, which at 60' × 30' × 30' (approx 20 × 10 × 10 metres) is by far the largest building of its kind in Britain. \n\nThe site is used for educational purposes and is open for public visits on special occasions. Regia Anglorum say that the primary purpose of the settlement is to enable the group's members to experience the lifestyle of the period in a more complete way than ever before. The site's name, Wychurst, is an Anglo-Saxon name meaning \"the village in the wood\", is situated in woods near to the Wildwood Discovery Park from Central London near Canterbury in Kent.\n\nLiving history encampments are a major feature of most re-enactment societies. A range of tented structures is erected at many Regia Anglorum events, and members demonstrate a variety of crafts and everyday activities in their historical context.\n\nRegia Anglorum currently owns seven vessels. The biggest is a 50'-long vessel no longer sea-worthy. Next are three similar hulls measuring 47' by 9' in the beam. Drawing about 3', they are suitable for use on inland waters and at sea in coastal waters. A 35' wooden replica is currently in use and sees constant use by the members for events and filmwork. They also own and operate two 20' smallcraft, one a generic shape for European waters, the other a replica of the Gokstad Faering and that too is in constant use at events throughout the UK in the course of a year.\n\nThe society's vessels are often used at events and in films on both the big and small screen, including \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Vikings\". \n\nLike most large reenactment groups, Regia Anglorum's activities include participation in local and national reenactment and reconstruction events such as the Battle of Hastings. A National Training Scheme exists to ensure authenticity and safety at these events.\n\nMembers of the society frequently appear as extras in film and television, and members have appeared in hundreds of separate works to date, from serious documentaries such as National Geographic's series about the Staffordshire Hoard, Michael Wood's \"Beowulf\", \"Blood of the Vikings\", \"\" and \"A History of Britain\" six separate appearances on \"Time Team\", the children's programme \"Blue Peter\" on four occasions to adverts and music videos.\n\nRegia Anglorum also has a team of horse riders, called The Radfolc.\n\nThe society funds its activities primarily through membership and events fees. It also provides facilities for school visits at many of its events. There are also teams and individuals who provide a school visitor service. Principally, their work mostly takes place in a Primary context under Key Stage 2 - \"Invaders\" but can also expand on the Battle of Hastings theme at the beginning of Key Stage 3.\n\n"}

The final report was approved on December 13, 2012, by a vote of 9–6, with seven Democrats, one Independent, and one Republican voting in favor of publication and six Republicans voting in opposition.\n\nThe 6,000-page report details actions by CIA officials and findings of the study of the Detention and Interrogation Program. On December 9, 2014—eight months after voting to release parts of the report—the SSCI released a 525-page portion that consisted of key findings and an executive summary of the full report. It took five years and $40 million to compile the report. The rest of it remains classified.\n\nThe report details actions by CIA officials, including torturing prisoners, providing misleading or false information about classified CIA programs to the media, impeding government oversight and internal criticism, and mismanaging the program. It also revealed the existence of previously unknown detainees, that more detainees were subjected to harsher treatment than was previously disclosed, and that more forms of torture were used than previously disclosed. It concluded that torturing prisoners did not help acquire actionable intelligence or gain cooperation from detainees and that the program damaged the United States' international standing.\n\nSome people, including CIA officials and U.S. Republicans, disputed the report's interpretations and said it provided an incomplete or inaccurate picture of the program. Others criticized the publishing of the report, citing its potential for damage to the U.S. and the contentious history of its development. Others, including President Barack Obama and former Republican presidential nominee, John McCain, praised the release of the report with the President stating \"one of the strengths that makes America exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past, face our imperfections, make changes and do better.\"\n\nIn the wake of the report, a large number of individuals and organizations have called for the prosecution of the CIA officials who perpetrated, approved, or provided legal cover for the torture of detainees.\n\nCalifornia Senator Dianne Feinstein said that the report was conducted after CIA Director of the National Clandestine Service, Jose Rodriguez, was found to have destroyed almost 100 video recordings of interrogations in 2005. The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) believed that he was covering up illegal activities by the CIA, although the committee had initially been told by CIA officials that Rodriguez was not engaging in \"destruction of evidence\". Rodriguez preemptively criticized the report in an op-ed for \"The Washington Post\" on December 5, 2014.\n\nOn March 5, 2009, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 14-1 to open an investigation into the CIA detention and interrogation program. In August 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder announced a parallel preliminary criminal investigation into the use of unauthorized interrogation techniques by CIA officials. As a result of the Attorney General's investigation, the Republican minority on the SSCI concluded that many witnesses were unlikely to participate in the investigation for fear of criminal liability. Citing the Attorney General investigation as their reason, the Republican minority of the SSCI withdrew their participation from the investigation in September 2009.\n\nThe report was led by Daniel J. Jones, and was prepared following a review of 6 million pages of documents, cables, emails, and other materials principally provided by the CIA. An additional 9400 classified documents repeatedly requested by the SSCI were withheld by the White House under a claim of executive privilege. Despite the initial expectation that interviews would be used, no formal interviews or hearings were conducted in the preparation of the report. The lack of interviews and hearings was one of the chief complaints of the Republican minority on SSCI, and contrasts with the 2008 Senate Armed Services Committee inquiry into the treatment of detainees in US military custody which conducted 70 in-person interviews, submitted written questions to 200 people, and had two hearings. The CIA estimated that approximately $40 million in personnel time and resources was spent assisting the investigation, including hiring additional staff to review documents prior to presenting them to the Committee and establishing a separate secure facility and computer network for CIA and Committee staff to use during the review.\n\nThe final report was approved on December 13, 2012, by a vote of 9–6, with seven Democrats, one Independent (Angus King), and one Republican (Susan Collins) voting in favor of publication and six Republicans voting in opposition, and the published minority views of Senator Chambliss were joined by Senators Burr, Risch, Coats, Rubio, and Coburn. On April 3, 2014, the SSCI voted 11–3 to submit a revised version of the executive summary, findings, and recommendations of the report for declassification analysis in preparation for future public release. After eight months, involving contentious negotiations about what details should remain classified, the revised executive summary, findings, and recommendations were made public with some redactions on December 9, 2014.\n\nInformation about the cooperation of foreign agencies with the CIA has been redacted from the report. The British chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee stated they would request access to anything taken out of the report at the request of British agencies.\n\nConcurrently with the public release, the six members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that voted against the report released their own 167-page report criticizing both the process and the conclusions of the report approved by the majority.\n\nOn December 17, 2013, Sen. Mark Udall (D-CO) revealed the existence of a secret internal review conducted by the CIA that was consistent with the Senate's report but conflicted with the CIA's official response to the report. In January 2014, CIA officials claimed that the Intelligence Committee had accessed review documents and removed them from CIA facilities in 2010 without CIA authorization. In March 2014, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, confirmed that copies of portions of the review had been removed and transferred to a safe in the Senate's Hart Office Building. She argued that the action was necessary to protect the documents from the CIA, which had destroyed videotapes depicting brutal interrogation methods in 2005.\n\nDuring an \"extraordinary\" 45-minute speech on March 11, 2014, Feinstein said the CIA unlawfully searched the Intelligence Committee's computers to determine how the committee staff obtained the review documents. Feinstein also said that the CIA's acting general counsel, later identified as Robert Eatinger, requested the FBI conduct a criminal inquiry into the committee staff's behavior. She said she believed that the request was \"a potential effort to intimidate [Intelligence Committee] staff.\" Eatinger had been one of two lawyers who approved the destruction of video tapes in 2005, and Feinstein added that Eatinger was mentioned by name over 1,600 times in the Committee's report. CIA director John O. Brennan denied the hacking allegations, stating, \"When the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong.\"\n\nOn July 31, 2014, the CIA confirmed that it had improperly gained access to the Senate Intelligence Committee's computer network. A Justice Department spokesman confirmed that they would not be pursuing charges in the hacking incident. An internal review panel appointed by Brennan defended the searches, noting \"that they were lawful and in some cases done at the behest of John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director.\"\n\nThe 6,000-page report produced 20 key findings. They are, verbatim from the unclassified summary report:\n\n\n\nAt least 26 of the 119 prisoners (22%) held by the CIA were subsequently found by the CIA to have been improperly detained, many having also experienced torture. Under the Memorandum of Notification signed by President George W. Bush to establish the CIA detention program, only persons who \"pose a continuing, serious threat of violence or death to U.S. persons and interests or planning terrorist activities\" were eligible for detention. Two innocent people were jailed and tortured based solely on allegations from another prisoner who fabricated information after having been tortured. Two former intelligence sources were jailed and tortured by accident. One mentally challenged man was held by the CIA in order to persuade family members to provide information. Among the 26 individuals who were acknowledged by the CIA to have been improperly detained, only three were released after less than one month in CIA custody, while most were confined for several months.\n\n\nContractors that developed the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" (John \"Bruce\" Jessen and James Mitchell), received 81 million for their services, out of an original contract worth more than 180 million. NBC News identified the contractors, who were referred to in the report via pseudonyms, as Mitchell, Jessen & Associates. Jessen was a senior psychologist at the Defense Department who taught special forces how to resist and endure torture (SERE). The report states that neither man had prior knowledge of Al Qaeda, nor were they practised interrogators, but they nevertheless \"developed the list of enhanced interrogation techniques and personally conducted interrogations of some of the CIA's most significant detainees using those techniques. The contractors also evaluated whether the detainees' psychological state allowed for continued use of the techniques, even for some detainees they themselves were interrogating or had interrogated.\"\n\nThe contractors developed a list of 20 forms of torture for use against detainees, which was cut down to 10 since some forms were considered too harsh. The list included waterboarding, sleep deprivation and stress positions. John Rizzo, the CIA acting general counsel who met with the contractors, described them as \"sadistic and terrifying\" in his book \"Company Man\". Mitchell and Jessen were formerly SERE psychologists who have been accused of \"reverse-engineering\" SERE techniques for use against detainees.\n\nAccording to the report, the Detention and Interrogation Program cost well over $300 million in non-personnel costs. This included funding for the CIA to construct and maintain detention facilities, including two facilities costing millions of dollars that were never used, in part due to host country political concerns. \"To encourage governments to clandestinely host CIA detention sites, or to increase support for existing sites, the CIA provided millions of dollars in cash payments to foreign government officials.\"\n\nThe report states that in 2006, the value of the CIA's base contract with the company formed by the psychologists with all options exercised was in excess of $180 million; \"the contractors received $81 million prior to the contract's termination in 2009. In 2007, the CIA provided a multi-year indemnification agreement to protect the company and its employees from legal liability arising out of the program. The CIA has since paid out more than $1 million pursuant to the agreement.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama said the report had revealed a \"troubling program\" and that \"We will rely on all elements of our national power, including the power and example of our founding ideals. That is why I have consistently supported the declassification of today's report. No nation is perfect. But one of the strengths that makes America exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past, face our imperfections, make changes and do better.\" The Obama administration consistently worked through White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough.\nCIA Director John O. Brennan agreed with the current administration's policy prohibiting enhanced interrogation techniques and admitted that the program had had \"shortcomings.\" He disagreed with the Committee's conclusion that information obtained through torture could have been obtained by other means, and said it is unknowable whether other interrogation approaches would have yielded the same information. In supporting his views, Brennan also released a 136-page declassified version of an official CIA response and critique of the torture report written in June 2013.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that they would not be pursuing bringing any charges against anyone who might have been involved in the use of torture, noting that they \"did not find any new information that they had not previously considered in reaching their determination.\" The Department of Justice had launched two investigations overseen by John Durham in 2009 that also did not result in charges. The rationale for the absence of charges has not been disclosed, but Mr. Durham did say that the full record of the possible evidence of criminal conduct and possible defenses that might be offered by any of those accused were contained in the pages of the Senate committee report that he was not going to release. Thus, it remains impossible for anyone to offer an independent evaluation of whether anyone involved was or was not guilty of criminal conduct. In response to a FOIA lawsuit seeking access to the full report, the Obama administration argued that the rationale for not releasing all the pages of the committee report was that \"disclosing them could affect the candor of law enforcement deliberations about whether to bring criminal charges.\" Given the apparent absence of those public deliberations, such a rationale seems almost incredibly obtuse, especially since, after the release of the Senate's report, several news outlets noted that \"the only CIA employee connected to its interrogation program to go to prison\" was John Kiriakou, the whistle-blower who was \"prosecuted for providing information to reporters.\"\n\nThree former CIA directors—George Tenet, Porter Goss and Michael V. Hayden—as well as three former CIA deputy directors, wrote an op-ed in \"The Wall Street Journal\" in response to the release of the Senate Intelligence Committee report. They criticized the report as \"a partisan attack on the agency that has done the most to protect America after the 9/11 attacks.\" They said that the CIA's interrogation program was invaluable to the capture of al Qaeda operatives and the disruption of al Qaeda's efforts and also stated that, contrary to the Senate Intelligence Committee's findings, \"there is no doubt that information provided by the totality of detainees in CIA custody […] was essential to bringing bin Laden to justice.\" Additionally, they wrote that the CIA remained within the interrogation techniques authorized by the DOJ; that the CIA did not mislead the DOJ, White House or Congress; and that the threat of a \"'ticking time bomb' scenario\" context was critical to understanding the program. Additionally, they established a website to defend the actions of the CIA.\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney, who was in office during the events discussed in the report, said the report's criticisms of the CIA were \"a bunch of hooey\" and that harsh interrogation tactics were \"absolutely, totally justified.\" He further said that he did not feel that the CIA misled him about the techniques used or the value of the information obtained from them, and that \"if I had to do it over again, I would.\"\n\nJohn Yoo, author of the Torture Memos, criticized the report as a partisan attack on American intelligence agencies and defended his belief that the CIA was legally allowed to use interrogation techniques that did not cause injury. He also stated that \"if the facts on which [he] based [his] advice were wrong, [he] would be willing to change [his] opinion of the interrogation methods.\" In an interview in CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\", Yoo said that the harsh treatments outlined in the report could violate anti-torture laws, stating that \"[i]f these things happened as described in the report [...] they were not supposed to be done.\" He voiced a similar opinion in a C-SPAN interview, saying that using the techniques cumulatively could violate anti-torture statute.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, opposed the study saying that they believe \"it will present serious consequences for U.S. national security\" and that the study was ideologically motivated. They also asserted that the program \"developed significant intelligence that helped us identify and capture important al-Qa'ida terrorists, disrupt their ongoing plotting, and take down Usama Bin Ladin.\" Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, stated that the report was a \"partisan effort\" by Democrats that \"could endanger the lives of Americans overseas\" and was not \"serious or constructive.\"\n\nSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, himself a victim of torture while a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said in a speech following Feinstein's presentation on the Senate floor that he supported the release of the report, and that those responsible for the interrogation policy had \"stained our national honor, did much harm and little practical good.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argued that the attorney general should appoint a special prosecutor to conduct a full investigation, with its director Anthony Romero saying the report showed the CIA had committed human rights violations. The Center for Constitutional Rights called for prosecutions of those responsible for the torture and joined a criminal complaint filed in Germany by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights.\n\nKenneth Roth from Human Rights Watch called for prosecutions of senior Bush officials who authorized torture and oversaw its use. Roth stated that failure to prosecute was \"more than just a failure of justice\" and \"means that torture effectively remains a policy option rather than a criminal offense.\" Steven W. Hawkins, the USA executive director of Amnesty International, called for justice saying, \"Under the UN convention against torture, no exceptional circumstances whatsoever can be invoked to justify torture, and all those responsible for authorizing or carrying out torture or other ill-treatment must be fully investigated.\"\n\nThe United Nations's special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights, Ben Emmerson, called for the prosecution of those responsible. He said that the CIA had \"commit[ed] systematic crimes and gross violations of international human rights law.\" Juan E. Méndez, the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture, said in a statement that many governments have used the American use of torture to justify their own abuses, saying \"If the U.S. tortures, why can't we do it?\" Mendez called the release of the report only the first step and called for \"the investigation and prosecution of those who were responsible for ordering, planning or implementing the C.I.A. torture program.\" Speaking on December 10, the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, commended the government's release of the report saying, \"Few countries will admit that their state apparatus has been practicing torture, and many continue shamelessly to deny it—even when it is well documented...\" Zeid called for accountability saying, \"In all countries, if someone commits murder, they are prosecuted and jailed. If they commit rape or armed robbery, they are prosecuted and jailed. If they order, enable or commit torture—recognized as a serious international crime—they cannot simply be granted immunity because of political expediency. When that happens, we undermine this exceptional Convention, and – as a number of U.S. political leaders clearly acknowledged yesterday – we undermine our own claims to be civilized societies rooted in the rule of law.\"\n\nThe Rohr Jewish Learning Institute designed a course around the report, investigating the balance between national security and the civil liberties of every individual.\n\nAfghan president Ashraf Ghani called the report \"shocking\" and said that the actions detailed in the report \"violated all accepted norms of human rights in the world.\"\n\nLithuanian Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius called on the U.S. to say whether the CIA used sites in his country to interrogate prisoners.\n\nFormer President of Poland Aleksander Kwasniewski said that he put pressure in 2003 on American officials to end interrogations at a secret CIA prison his country hosted, saying, \"I told Bush that this cooperation must end and it did end.\"\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said the \"shocking report shows violence, extremism, and secrecy as institutionalized in the US security system.\"\n\nThe North Korean government called on the United Nations Security Council to investigate the \"most brutal medieval forms\" of torture practiced by the CIA at \"black sites\" around the world.\n\nOnly a limited number of copies of the full report were made, and Human Rights workers are concerned that the CIA might succeed in destroying all copies of this report they found so embarrassing. \nOn December 29, 2016, less than a month before the end of the Obama administration, District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the preservation of the full classified report, in case it was needed during the prosecution or appeal of senior suspects during their Guantanamo Military Commissions.\n\n\n"}

It arose as an oral tradition and exists in many variants. It is currently earliest attested in English, but was and remains common throughout Europe as well.\n\nThe irregularity of the lengths of the months descends from the Roman calendar, which came to be adopted throughout Europe and then worldwide. The months of Rome's original lunar calendar would have varied between 29 and 30 days, depending on observations of the phases of the moon. Reforms credited to Romulus and Numa established a set year of twelve fixed months. Possibly under the influence of the Pythagoreans in southern Italy, Rome considered odd numbers more lucky and set the lengths of the new months to 29 and 31 days, apart from the last month February and the intercalary month Mercedonius. Its imperfect system and political manipulation of intercalation caused it to slip greatly out of alignment with the solar year, which was known to consist of ¼ of 1461 days (rather than 1460 days) by the time of Meton in the 5thcentury. Rather than adopt a new system like the Egyptian calendar, which had 12 months of 30 days each and a set, annual intercalary month of 5 days, Caesar aimed for his 46 reform to maintain as much continuity as possible with the old calendar. Ultimately, Mercedonius was removed, the four existing 31-day months were maintained, February was left unchanged apart from leap years, and the needful additional ten days of the year were added to the 29-day months to make them either 30 or 31 days long.\n\nBy the Renaissance, the irregularity of the resulting system had inspired Latin verses to remember the order of long and short months. The first known published form appeared in a 1488 edition of the Latin verses of Anianus:\n\nIn 2011, the Welsh author Roger Bryan discovered an older English form of the poem written at the bottom of a page of saints' days for February within a Latin manuscript in the British Library's Harleian manuscripts. He dated the entry to 1425 ±20 years.\n\nThe first published English version appeared in Richard Grafton's \"Abridgment of the Chronicles of England\" in 1562 as \"A Rule to Know How Many Dayes Euery Moneth in the Yere Hath\":\n\n\"September\" and \"November\" have identical rhythm and rhyme and are thus poetically interchangeable. The early versions tended to favour November and as late as 1891 it was being given as the more common form of the rhyme in some parts of the United States. It is less common now and September variants have a long history as well. A manuscript copy of the verse from runs:\n\nAnother English version from before 1574 is found in a manuscript among the Mostyn Papers held at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth.\n\nVariants appear throughout Europe. The typical Italian form is\n\nThe various forms of the poem are usually considered a doggerel nursery rhyme. In the academic drama \"Return from Parnassus\", Sir Raderic's overenthusiastic appreciation of its poetry is of a piece with his own low level of culture and education.\n\nIt has, however, also earned praise. It's been called \"one of the most popular and oft-repeated verses in the English language\" and \"probably the only sixteenth-century poem most ordinary citizens know by heart\". Groucho Marx claimed \"My favorite poem is the one that starts 'Thirty Days Hath September...', because it actually means something.\" On the other hand, the unhelpfulness of such an involved mnemonic has been mocked, as in the early 20th-century parody \"Thirty days hath September/ But all the rest I can't remember\" It continues to be taught in schools as children learn the calendar, although others employ the knuckle mnemonic instead.\n\n\"Thirty Days Hath September...\" is also occasionally parodied or referenced in wider culture, such as the 1960 Burma-Shave jingle \"Thirty days/ Hath September/ April/ June and the/ Speed offender\".\n\n\n\n"}

His father Otto Franke had set up the chair in 1910.\n\nWolfgang Franke was born in Hamburg on 24 July 1912, the fourth and youngest child of the prominent sinologist Otto Franke and his wife Luise Niebuhr. He had a sister, as well as two brothers who died in their teens.\n\nFranke graduated from the Grunewald Gymnasium in Berlin, and studied sinology at the University of Berlin from 1931 to 1934, but transferred in his final year to the University of Hamburg where he studied under . He received his doctorate degree in 1935, with a dissertation on the 1898 Hundred Days' Reform of Kang Youwei.\n\nAfter serving in the military for a year, Franke left for China, arriving in Shanghai on 18 May 1937, just before the Battle of Shanghai and the Second Sino-Japanese War began. From 1937 to 1945 he worked as a research assistant at the German Institute (\"Deutschland-Institut\") in Beijing, thus avoided being drafted into the German Army during World War II, during which many of his friends were killed. In his autobiography, he writes that \"I had the feelings of having lived here in my previous life and felt from the first day on at home.\"\n\nIn 1941 Franke fell in love with Hu Junyin (; 1910–1988), the daughter of a Chinese scholar who had studied in Germany. However, because of Nazi Germany's prohibition of interracial marriage, they did not marry until March 1945, near the end of World War II. They had a son and a daughter.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, he became a professor at Sichuan University and the private West China Union College in Chengdu, teaching Ming history and German history. Two years later, he became a professor of German language at Peking University.\n\nWhen peace was restored in post-war Germany, Franke returned to Hamburg with his family in 1950. He was appointed Chair of Sinology at the University of Hamburg, and was also Director of the Seminar for Language and Culture in China. He was the fourth holder of the Chair of Sinology and succeeded his father Otto Franke, who had set up the chair in 1910. He worked there until his retirement in 1977.\n\nAfter his wife died in 1988, Franke moved to Petaling Jaya near the University of Malaya, where he had students and friends. He lived in Malaysia until his late eighties, when he moved to Berlin in May 2000 to live with his daughter. In his final years, when he could no longer travel, his daughter hired Chinese students to look after him, so that he could speak Chinese to someone. He died in Berlin on 6 September 2007, at the age of 95.\n\nFranke was internationally known as a China expert with research focuses on the Ming dynasty and history of the Chinese in Southeast Asia. He worked in various national and international committees on China and Asia studies and was a member of the university club of the University of Hamburg.\n\nImportant works by Franke include:\n\nHe also wrote a two-volume autobiography \"Im Banne Chinas\" (\"Under the Spell of China\"; part 1: 1912–1950 and part 2: 1950–1998). In addition, from the mid-1960s onwards, he dealt intensively with the scholars in Southeast Asia and collected epigraphic material. The results of his research were published in English in several volumes for Malaysia 1983–87, Indonesia 1997 and Thailand 1998.\n"}

This calendar is based on the founding of the Republic of China in 1912 (year 1), so the year 2011 on the Western Gregorian calendar corresponds to year 100 on Taiwan's official calendar, which posed potential problems for any program that only treats years as two-digit values.\n\nAs generally speaking only governmental offices used the official system, Y1C computer bug impact on the private sector was minimal. The potential to affect government systems was another matter. However, a large number of governmental computers were already using a three-digit system for dates, with a zero being used as the first digit for years below 100 (Gregorian 2010 or earlier).\n\nSome government documents such as driver's licenses already refer to years over 100; nothing more than minor glitches were reported.\n\nSome iPhone users reported that their alarm tool failed to function on 1 January 2011.\n\nThe North Korean (\"Juche\") calendar was affected the same day as Taiwan's, as North Korea's calendar is also based on an event that happened in 1912 - the birthday of Kim Il-sung.\n\n\n"}
