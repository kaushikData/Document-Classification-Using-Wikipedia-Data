{"id": "5697193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5697193", "title": "1980s professional wrestling boom", "text": "1980s professional wrestling boom\n\nThe 1980s professional wrestling boom (more commonly referred to as the Golden Age) was a surge in the popularity of professional wrestling in the United States and elsewhere throughout the 1980s. The expansion of cable television and pay-per-view, coupled with the efforts of promoters such as Vince McMahon, saw professional wrestling shift from a system controlled by numerous regional companies to one dominated by two nationwide companies: McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The decade also saw a considerable decline in the power of the NWA, a cartel which had until then domineered the wrestling landscape, and in the efforts to sustain belief in the verisimilitude of wrestling.\n\nIn the early 1980s, professional wrestling in the U.S. consisted mainly of three competing organizations: the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in the Northeast, the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in the Midwest, and the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), which ran a territorial system around the country.\n\nMultiple NWA territories were very successful in the 1970s and continued that success in the early 1980s. TBS became a cable television superstation based on broadcasting Georgia Championship Wrestling with both Mr. Wrestling II and Tommy Rich being the top headliners in the territory. Ric Flair rose to prominence in Mid Atlantic Wrestling, while Dusty Rhodes was the fan favorite in Championship Wrestling from Florida. Mid South Wrestling had the first significant African American champion babyface Junkyard Dog.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, the AWA had the largest television business with distribution of their weekly broadcast in Chicago, Denver, Green Bay, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Omaha, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Francisco and Winnipeg. The AWA expanded into the top ten media market of the Bay Area after Roy Shire ran his last battle royale (the annual Royal Rumble continues this idea) at the Cow Palace on January 24, 1981, demonstrating that the AWA was positioned to prosper as other promotions failed.\n\nThe AWA had the talent what would ultimately lead Vince McMahon Jr.'s WWE to pre-eminence in professional wrestling. Gene Okerlund and Bobby Heenan were AWAs major on air talent. Hulk Hogan became the top babyface after Verne Gagne retired from full-time wrestling in 1981 and Nick Bockwinkel became the AWA World Heavyweight Champion. Hogan faced Bockwinkel on April 18, 1982, and on April 24, 1983, with both being decided with \"Dusty finishes\" where Hogan pinned Bockwinkel for a three count, but was then stripped of the title. Hogan said Gagne offered him the championship on the latter occasion in exchange for his merchandise rights and money from touring with other promotions which would show Gagne understood wrestling was becoming a bigger business in the 1980s; however, Hogan refused. Gagne's failure to keep his fortunate position is a significant factor in the history of professional wrestling.\n\nIn 1982, Continental Productions, a subsidiary of Dallas independent station KXTX began syndicating a one-hour show internationally from the Sportatorium in Dallas, Texas, of former NWA affiliate World Class Championship Wrestling run by Fritz Von Erich. Channel 11 had broadcast Von Erich's professional wrestling television program as Saturday Night Wrestling for over a decade before Channel 39 began the second broadcast.\n\nThe channel 39 broadcast was innovative because it was more like professional sports with host Bill Mercer, a former broadcaster for the Dallas Cowboys and Texas Rangers, mobile cameras at ringside with multiple shotgun microphones as used by Don King to capture and enhance the sound of impacts and crowd noise for boxing pay per views, and vignettes and interviews inspired by the Rocky movies to accentuate the heel or babyface of a wrestler outside of the ring.\n\nThe show featured the babyface Von Erich brothers David, Kerry, and Kevin against heels from the stable of Gary Hart, who culminated nearly two decades of his career in Texas by booking the feud between the Freebirds and the Von Erichs in 1982, and then Skandor Akbar's Devastation, Inc. stable in 1983. The channel 39 syndicated show earned extremely high ratings - higher than \"Saturday Night Live\" and many wrestling promotions in the United States, including the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and the WWF.\n\nThe Von Erichs were the most recognizable babyfaces in professional wrestling throughout the United States in 1982 and 1983. The fall of the Von Erichs and death of nearly every wrestler associated with the promotion are attributed to abuse of drugs, primarily steroids, stimulants including cocaine, and pain killing opiates.\n\nIn 1982, Vince McMahon purchased the business from his ailing father Vincent J. McMahon. On December 23, 1983, he signed AWA superstar Hulk Hogan to debut in 1984. To play Hogan's nemesis, he signed talents including World Championship Wrestling heel \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and AWA manager Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan. McMahon stated in the documentary \"The UnReal Story of Professional Wrestling\" that he did not think his father would have ever sold him the company if he knew what he was planning to do. \"He probably would have said, 'Vinny, what are you doing? You're gonna wind up at the bottom of a river'\", he explained.\n\nAt the end of 1983, two major developments increased competition to be the premier professional wrestling promotion. On November 24, 1983, Ric Flair defeated Harley Race for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at the closed circuit wrestling event Starrcade, which inaugurated Flair's golden era and was credited with showing that a major event could earn significant income across many locations. On December 23, 1983, WWF signed Hogan to return after appearing in \"Rocky III\" in 1982 and developing a babyface gimmick in the AWA.\n\nFortune for the WWF came at the expense of WCCW and AWA. On January 23, 1984, Hogan defeated The Iron Sheik for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at Madison Square Garden. Shortly after the match, the WWF began promoting wrestling shows with Hogan in the main event in parts of the United States outside the Northeast, which changed a long-standing non-aggression pact between the WWF and other wrestling promotions. On February 10, David Von Erich died in Tokyo, Japan. While there was a short term boost culminating in Kerry Von Erich's victory over Ric Flair for the NWA World title in front of a packed Texas Stadium crowd on May 6, WCCW rapidly lost momentum as the death of Gino Hernandez and the suicide of Mike Von Erich caused a cloud over the promotion that became its legacy. The AWA signed a TV contract with ESPN, but the revenue was insignificant compared to the WWF's pay per view business, which was based on annual March/April events featuring Hogan in a landmark world championship match each year from 1986 to 1991.\n\nWith competition from cable superstations broadcasting WCCW, AWA and NWA, McMahon syndicated WWF television shows outside of the promotion's traditional Northeastern territory and began a home video distribution label called Coliseum Video. McMahon would use the additional income generated by advertising, television deals, and video sales and rentals to further his bold ambition to tour nationally. However, such a venture required huge capital investment — one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse.\n\nMcMahon did not meet immediate success. In May 1984, in a failed attempt to garner a greater appeal in the Southeast, McMahon bought a controlling interest in Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), an NWA member which held the lucrative Saturday time slot on Atlanta-based independent station WTBS—known outside of Atlanta as \"Superstation TBS.\" On July 14, 1984 — later dubbed \"Black Saturday\" — WWF programming began airing in the TBS timeslot formerly occupied by GCW programming. The WWF programming was not successful and viewed as comical compared to the NWA. Due to low ratings and viewer protests, TBS began airing wrestling by Ole Anderson's promotion, as well as Bill Watts's Mid-South Wrestling, both of which garnered higher ratings than McMahon's WWF show. Later, McMahon sold the TBS timeslot to rival promoter Jim Crockett, Jr. for $1 million. In the WWE documentary \"The Rise and Fall of WCW\", Crockett explained that his purchase of the timeslot basically paid for McMahon's first WrestleMania.\n\nBy the end of 1984, the regional territory system of the NWA in Canada and the United States was clearly in jeopardy. In June 1984, Jack Tunney transferred his control in Maple Leaf Wrestling to the WWF. The AWA, WCCW and Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association formed Pro Wrestling USA in 1985 but the endeavor failed by the end of the year.\n\nMany fans, especially those in the Deep South, were angered by the collapse of their local wrestling promotions. Some of the more well known promotions included Championship Wrestling from Florida and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling in Charlotte, North Carolina, were affected. These fans turned to Atlanta-based WCW broadcast on TBS. In most of these areas, WWF shows were not financially successful until 1997-98.\n\nThe WWF would go on to a period of unprecedented success in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s. The success was in part precipitated by the \"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection\", a period of cooperation and cross-promotion between the WWF and elements of the music industry. The idea was formed by WWF manager Lou Albano, who met singer Cyndi Lauper on a trip to Puerto Rico. Lauper asked Albano to appear as her father in her video for the single \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" in 1983. \nMcMahon later booked Lauper and Albano on a segment of \"Piper's Pit\". During the segment, the Rock 'n' Wrestling storyline began when Lou called Lauper a \"broad\", while Lauper retaliated by hitting him with her purse. She then challenged Lou to a match between two female wrestlers of their choice.\n\nMTV broadcast the first live wrestling match on cable television as well as the first live women's professional wrestling match. Lauper chose Wendi Richter, while Albano chose The Fabulous Moolah. The match was scheduled for July 23, 1984, at \"The Brawl to End it All\", broadcast live on MTV. During the match, Lauper interfered on Richter's behalf by hitting Moolah in the head with her purse, dubbed \"The Loaded Purse of Doom\". At the conclusion of the match, Richter defeated Moolah for the WWF Women's Championship, which the WWF had promoted as having been held by Moolah for the previous 28 years. The connection between Lauper and the WWF continued with the video for the song \"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\", \"Time After Time\", and \"She Bop\", all of which featured WWF wrestlers. Richter later had a match with Moolah's protégé Leilani Kai at \"The War to Settle the Score\", with Lauper and Moolah in their respective corners. Kai won the title with the help of Moolah. Richter and Kai had a rematch at the inaugural WrestleMania, where Richter regained the title.\n\nOn September 14, 1985, \"Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling\", an animated television series starring the character of Hulk Hogan, premiered on CBS. The series ran until June 6, 1987, in the process expanding Hogan's young fanbase.\n\nIn 1985, to counter the AWA's Super Sunday, the NWA's Starrcade and WCCW's Star Wars, the WWF created its own flagship show, WrestleMania I, held at Madison Square Garden and broadcast on 135 closed-circuit networks. The future of not just the WWF's national experiment but the whole professional wrestling industry came down to the success or failure of this pay-per-view. WrestleMania was an extravaganza marketed as \"the Super Bowl of professional wrestling\". The concept of a wrestling supercard was nothing new in North America; the NWA had been running Starrcade a few years prior to WrestleMania, and even the elder McMahon had marketed large Shea Stadium cards viewable in closed circuit locations. However, Wrestlemania I drew the interest of the mainstream media by including celebrities such as Mr. T and Cyndi Lauper to participate in the event. MTVs popularity and coverage of the Women's wrestling feud created a great deal of interest in WWF programming at this time.\n\nThe show was a huge success. Hogan, who won in the main event, appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" which, after the swimsuit issue, was the magazine's best seller of 1985. Professional wrestling began to become mainstream, thanks, in large part, to the appeal of Hulkamania among children. Large television networks took wrestling into their weekly programming, including \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", premiering on NBC in May 1985, as well as the syndicated weekly show \"WWF Championship Wrestling\" (which was also broadcast internationally). While \"Championship Wrestling\" was generally taped in Poughkeepsie, New York, \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" was taped in front of packed arenas around the country.\n\nWrestleMania's popularity and ratings appeal made professional wrestling a television mainstay. Professional wrestling, now synonymous with the WWF, began to throw more grandiose matches. In November 1985, a second pay-per-view \"The Wrestling Classic\" took place. The concept, a one-night tournament, was a huge success and would become a regular event, titled King of the Ring.\n\nJim Crockett, also envisioning a nationwide promotion, absorbed several other NWA members into a single entity known as Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). In 1986, he renamed JCP \"NWA World Championship Wrestling\". He would acquire several more promotions, including some non-NWA members, in the following year. By late 1987, Crockett's ownership of so many NWA affiliates, coupled with his continued presidency of the NWA, gave him considerable power. However, Crockett's spending had left JCP indebted, with the promotion facing a $5 million deficit. Crockett's attempt to generate revenue with the broadcast of the highly promoted Starrcade pay-per-view in late 1987 was thwarted by McMahon, who held his Survivor Series pay-per-view on the same day. The WWF threatened to cancel their contracts with cable companies that dared to carry Starrcade. As a result, only five cable companies opted to remain loyal to Crockett, which gave them only an $80,000 profit after expenses. A similar situation arose in January 1988, when Crockett's Bunkhouse Stampede pay-per-view was counter-programmed by the inaugural Royal Rumble, which aired for free on the USA Network. On November 21, 1988, Crockett was obliged to sell his promotion to Ted Turner. Under the ownership of Turner, the promotion was rechristened World Championship Wrestling (WCW). After years of financial turmoil and the constant changing of bookers, WCW would resume competition with McMahon's WWF when former AWA commentator Eric Bischoff was appointed as the promotion's Executive Vice President.\n\nWWF held its most successful event, WrestleMania III, in March 1987. It achieved the largest recorded attendance for a live indoor sporting event in North America. The main event, where Hogan scoop-slammed (later dubbed \"the body slam heard around the world\") and defeated André the Giant, helped the show go down in wrestling history as one of the greatest ever produced and made the WWF's popularity soar. In February 1988, Hogan and André faced each other in a special WrestleMania III rematch on the Friday night prime time spin-off of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", titled \"The Main Event\" which saw Hogan lose to André by manipulation of the \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase. After the match, André handed the title to DiBiase as promised, resulting in the title being vacated and setting the stage for a WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament at WrestleMania IV. On a previous edition of the same show, \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage made his official transition from heel to babyface in his match against The Honky Tonk Man, with Miss Elizabeth bringing in Hogan to aid Savage against The Honky Tonk Man and The Hart Foundation. This eventually struck a friendship between Savage and Hogan.\n\nAt WrestleMania IV, Savage won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament, with Elizabeth and Hogan at his side. Months later, Hogan and Savage teamed up as The Mega Powers; and at the first ever SummerSlam, they faced off against DiBiase and André's tag team known as The Mega Bucks. Though friends and tag partners, over the period of a year tensions began to build for various reasons, finally resulting in Savage striking Hogan in early 1989, turning Savage heel once again, and setting up a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania V, which saw Hogan after over a year once again hold the title. Savage and Hogan continued to feud until the February 1990 edition of \"The Main Event\", where Hogan successfully defended the title in a special WrestleMania V rematch.\n\nGenerally, WrestleMania VI on April 1, 1990, is acknowledged as the end of the 1980s wrestling boom. The event saw one of the last WWF appearances of André the Giant (as a member of the Colossal Connection), who had become barely mobile in the ring due to real life health issues, and his parting with long-time manager Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan. In addition, Nikolai Volkoff (then part of The Bolsheviks) played his standard part as the evil Soviet Russian for one last time before turning babyface and embracing America, reflecting the end of the Cold War. The main event was a title-for-title match between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion The Ultimate Warrior. It not only pitted the WWF's two biggest faces against each other, but was intended as the \"passing of the torch\" from Hogan, the star of the 1980s, to Warrior, who was immensely popular and considered to be Hogan's successor. Hogan's clean pin fall loss (another first) signaled the end of an era. However, Hogan lingered on in the WWF for the next three years, winning the title for another three times. By the early 1990s, Hogan started appearing with much less frequency on WWF events, with Warrior taking the main-event spot through all of 1990 and 1991.\n\nIn 1992, allegations of anabolic steroid abuse and sexual harassment were harming the WWF's family-friendly image. Around this time as well, Dr. George Zahorian, a member of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission, was accused of selling anabolic steroids to many WWF wrestlers, including Hogan, who took a long hiatus from the WWF after WrestleMania VIII.\n\nThe fans who were kids in the mid and late 1980s were teens by the 1990s, and many eventually grew bored with the comic book style of wrestling of the 1980s, turning their attention away from their childhood favorites such as Hogan, Junkyard Dog, and \"Superfly\" Jimmy Snuka, in favor of newer and grittier wrestlers like The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Razor Ramon, Diesel, and Bret \"Hitman\" Hart; then in the Attitude Era in favor of Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, Mick Foley (whether competing as Cactus Jack, Dude Love, or Mankind), and The New Age Outlaws. This was special to Hogan's return to the WWF in February 1993, episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" (which replaced another WWF program during the 1980s, \"Prime Time Wrestling\") where Hogan received a lackluster reaction from the crowds.\n\n"}

{"id": "20361898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20361898", "title": "Aboriginal dugout canoe", "text": "Aboriginal dugout canoe\n\nAboriginal Canoes were a significant advancement in canoe technology. Dugouts were stronger, faster, and more efficient than previous types of bark canoes. The Aboriginal peoples' use of these canoes brought about many changes to both their hunting practices and society. The Australian Aboriginal people began using these canoes around the 17th century in coastal regions of Australia. As the popularity of dugouts grew their use quickly spread across the continent. Dugout canoes were brought to Northern Australia by Buginese trepang (sea cucumber) fishermen from Makassar, South Sulawesi, current evidence says from around 1640.\n\nAboriginal canoes were constructed much more easily than previous types of vessels, such as bark canoes. This ease of construction played a significant role in the dugout canoes’ widespread use. While earlier vessels required a great deal of labor and time-consuming sewing to make, dugout canoes were constructed easily and in a shorter period of time. First, one would have to cut down a tree and shape the exterior into an even form. The sides of the canoe were shaped in one of two ways. They were either carved straight up and down or in a \"u\" shape, curving in towards the center of the boat. Next, one would literally dig out the inner wood of the log to make space for the oarsmen to sit and paddle. In some early dugout canoes, Aboriginal people would not make the bottoms of the canoes smooth, but would instead carve \"ribbing\" into the vessel. Ribbing (literally sections of wood that looked like ribs) was used to stabilize bark canoes, and though not necessary to dugout canoes, was a carryover in the transition from one canoe type to the other. Both the chopping down of the tree and the digging out of the log were easily done with an iron-axe. \n\nThe wood used in the construction of dugout canoes was essential to its strength and durability. A wide variety of trees were used depending upon the location of a particular people, but in most cases the Aboriginal people used a type of native sycamore possibly Litsea reticulata or Cryptocarya glaucescens (Silver sycamore), White sycamore (Polyscias elegans or Cryptocarya obovata), Ceratopetalum succirubrum (Satin sycamore), Cardwellia sublimia, Cryptocarya hypospodia (Bastard Sycamore), Ceratopetalum virchowii (Pink Sycamore) or Ceratopetalum corymbosum (Mountain sycamore). Sycamores are strong and extremely durable, making them suitable for use in the construction of dugout canoes.\n\nBoth sea turtles and dugongs were essential components of the Aboriginal diet. The transformation from bark canoes to dugout canoes greatly increased the ability of the tribal hunters to catch and kill both of these types of sea creatures due primarily to a more formidable structure. Dugout canoes included a stronger and better platform for harpooning that greatly increased the stability of an upright hunter by providing essential footing. In order to capture dugongs and sea turtles, the hunters needed to maintain the utmost degree of stealth. Perfect balance was required and the new dugout canoes gave the hunters this necessary edge.\n\nAdditionally, the shift towards using dugout canoes maximized the overall possibilities of seafarers. Not only did increased sturdiness, speed and stability of Dugout canoes make hunting easier, but these characteristics also allowed for long-distance travel. Whereas Bark canoes had been only used for inland use or travel extremely close to the shore, Dugout canoes offered a far greater range of travel which allowed for trade outside the area of the village. Dugout canoes were capable of traveling distances over 500 km. This new vessel gave the Aboriginal people the ability and opportunity to explore, trade and locate additional resources located outside the central location.\n\nThe widespread use of dugout canoes had many impacts on Aboriginal life. The most significant were results of the Aboriginal peoples' ability to hunt larger prey. With the strength to transport larger prey over longer distances, dugout enabled the Aboriginals to vastly expand their hunting grounds. This larger prey also enabled the Aboriginals to support a larger group of people over a longer period of time. This increase in the ability to support population led to both population growth and expansion.\n\n"}
{"id": "343809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343809", "title": "Al-Maqrizi", "text": "Al-Maqrizi\n\nTaqi al-Din Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn 'Ali ibn 'Abd al-Qadir ibn Muhammad al-Maqrizi (1364–1442) (Arabic: ) was an Egyptian Arab historian more commonly known as al-Maqrizi or Makrizi. Although he was \"a Mamluk-era historian and himself a Sunni Muslim, he is remarkable in this context for his unusually keen interest in the Isma'ili Fatimid dynasty and its role in Egyptian history.\"\n\nMaqrizi was born in Fatimid Cairo and spent most of his life in Egypt, When he presents himself in his books he usually stops at the 10th forefather although he confessed to some of his close friends that he can trace his ancestry to Al-Mu‘izz li-Din Allah -first Fatimid caliph in Egypt and the founder of al-Qahirah- and even to Ali ibn Abi Talib. He was trained in the Hanafite school of law. Later, he switched to the Shafi'ite school and finally to the Zahirite school. Maqrizi studied theology under one of the primary masterminds behind the Zahiri Revolt, and his vocal support and sympathy with that revolt against the Mamluks likely cost him higher administrative and clerical positions with the Mamluk regime. The name Maqrizi was an attribution to a quarter of the city of Baalbek, from where his paternal grandparents hailed. Maqrizi confessed to his contemporaries that he believed that he was related to the Fatimids through the son of al-Muizz. Ibn Hajar preserves the most memorable account: his father, as they entered the al-Hakim Mosque one day, told him \"My son, you are entering the mosque of your ancestor.\" However, his father also instructed al-Maqrizi not to reveal this information to anyone he could not trust; Walker concludes:\n\nIn 1385, he went on the Islamic pilgrimage, the Hajj. For some time he was secretary in a government office, and in 1399 became inspector of markets for Cairo and northern Egypt. This post he soon gave up to become a preacher at the Mosque of 'Amr ibn al 'As, president of the al-Hakim Mosque, and a lecturer on tradition. In 1408, he went to Damascus to become inspector of the Qalanisryya and lecturer. Later, he retired into private life at Cairo.\n\nIn 1430, he again went on Hajj with his family and travelled for some five years. His learning was great, his observation accurate and his judgement good, but his books are largely compilations, and he does not always acknowledge the sources upon which he relied.\n\nMost of Al-Maqrizi's works, exceeding 200, are concerned with Egypt. The most important is the \"Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar\" (2 vols., Bulaq, 1854), translated into French by Urbain Bouriant as \"Description topographique et historique de l'Égypte\" (Paris, 1895–1900; compare A. R. Guest, \"A List of Writers, Books and other Authorities mentioned by El Maqrizi in his Khitat,\" in \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society\", 1902, pp. 103–125).\n\nOf his \"History of the Fatimites\" an extract was published by J.G.L. Kosegarten in his \"Chrestomathia\" (Leipzig, 1828), pp. 115–123; the \"History of the Ayyubit and Mameluke Rulers\" has been translated into French by Etienne Marc Quatremère (2 vols., Paris, 1837–1845).\n\nMaqrizi began a large work called the \"Muqaffa\", an encyclopedia of Egyptian biography in alphabetic order. Another Egyptian historian, al-Sakhawi, believed this would require eighty volumes to complete, but only sixteen were written. Three autograph volumes exist in manuscript in Leiden and one in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kamiński kept a permanent column entitled \"Scouting life\" in the magazine \"Echo Pruszkowskie\".\n\nIn the years 1925–1927 commander of the Pruszków Troup, and from autumn 1928 to December 1929 commander of the Masovian Banner. At the same time, from September 1928 to June 1929, team captain of the 6th Warsaw Scouting Team \"Jan Henryk Dąbrowski\".Since 1931, head of the Minority Teams Department in the Headquarters of the Scouts. He was also the head of the Central Committee of the Union of Jewish Scouting Teams and Cubs.\n\nCreator of the cubs methodology (in cooperation with Jadwiga Zwolakowska). Author of novels, which were also methodological manuals for instructors of the ZHP Scouts: \"Antek Cwaniak\" (1932), \"Książka wodza zuchów\" (1933) and \"Koło rady\" (1935).\n\nHead of the Faculty of Cubs at the Headquarters of the Scouts until September 1937 (with a break from April to September 1933). Since September 1933 commander of the School of Cubs Instructors in Nierodzim, Cieszyn Silesia, and since May 1937 until the outbreak of the war head of the Scouting Centre in nearby Górki Wielkie near Skoczów (the School of Cubs Instructors was incorporated into the centre). Head of the Department of Senior Scouts Education in the Headquarters of the Polish Scouting Association.\n\nIn July 1934 Kamiński conducted an international cubs training course in Brenna (Beskid Śląski), later, in July 1938, headed a Polish delegation to an international conference of cubs instructors in Gilwell, Great Britain. He participated in Jamboree in Great Britain in 1929, Hungary in 1933 and the Netherlands in 1937, and in the International Cubs Conference in July 1939 in Edinburgh (the next such conference was to be held in Poland).\n\nAfter the outbreak of the war, evacuated in September 1939 from Silesia, he arrived in Warsaw around 12 September and joined the Scouting Rescue Headquarters. After the surrender of the capital he managed a temporary orphanage for children orphaned during the siege of Warsaw.\n\nIn conspiracy since October 1939, member of the strict Headquarters (\"Pasieka\") of the Grey Ranks. Since that month Kamiński was also active in the Service for Poland's Victory. The initiator, organizer and then editor-in-chief of the \"Information Bulletin\" (issued weekly since 5 November 1939 by the Warsaw-City District SZP-ZWZ-AK, and since spring of 1941 by the Home Army Headquarters, the most important conspiratorial newspaper in occupied Poland – circulation up to 47 thousand). During his work in the paper he used his alias \"Kaźmierczak\", and since November 1942 \"Hubert\", as well as \"Fabrykant\" and \"Kamyk\". He was also the author of most of the introductory articles in the \"Information Bulletin\".\n\nIn \"Przeglad Propagandowy\" (1943 No. 2), under the alias \"Hubert\", Kamiński published an article \"Podstawy ideowe propagandy wojskowej\" (The Ideological Basics of Military Propaganda).\n\nAt the same time, in April 1941 Kamiński succeeded Captain Zygmunt Hempel in leading the BiP Division of the Warsaw-City District of ZWZ – Warsaw District of the Home Army under the alias \"Faktor\", and from November 1942 – \"Fabrykant\". Among other things, a cell called \"Sztuka\" (Art) was created, which initiated works of art, which were distributed or exhibited during the occupation (puppet theatre, caricatures, songs). He organized and then supervised the work of the Propaganda Commission (KOPR), which since spring of 1942 had been producing the entire publishing output of the Home Army Warsaw District Headquarters. He remained the head of BiP of the Warsaw Home Army District Headquarters until June 1944.\n\nAt the same time, from 1941 until the outbreak of the Warsaw uprising, under the alias \"Hubert\", Kamiński was a counterintelligence officer in the unit II of the Main Headquarters of ZWZ-AK.\n\nCreator of the concept, founder and since December 1940 commander-in-chief of the Small Sabotage Organization \"Wawer\" under the pseudonym \"Dąbrowski\". At that time, he wrote an article titled \"Little Sabotage\" (Information Bulletin, 1 September 1940). The best known and most visible effects of Wawer's activity include drawings of the \"anchor\" of the Fighting Poland and \"V\" signs, as well as anti-German inscriptions in public places, distribution of leaflets, gassing of cinemas and megaphone actions. Kamiński personally participated in the first series of such actions – destruction of exhibitions of photographers showing photographs of uniformed Germans (5 December 1940).\n\nKamiński is the author of one of the most famous books of occupied Warsaw, \"Kamienie na szaniec\" (Stones for the Rampart), which was first published in July 1943. He wrote the book on the basis of Tadeusz \"Zośka\" Zawadzki's account of his colleagues from the 23rd Warsaw Scouting Team, including Jan Bytnar and Aleksy Dawidowski, written after the Arsenal action in April 1943.\n\nHe was also the author of The Great Game (the first edition was destroyed in 1942 by order of the Home Army Main Command as it was deconspirating the methods of underground combat, the second edition was not distributed due to the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising, the third edition – Warsaw 1981) and \"Przodownik. Podręcznik dla kierowników oddziałów Zawiszy\" (\"The Leader. Manual for Branch Managers of Zawisza\") (part 1-2, December 1942, edition II 1943, edition III 1944).In April 1944, Kamiński was placed by the counterintelligence of the National Armed Forces (NSZ) on one of the so-called proscription lists (it included the names of people suspected of being leftist, Communist and/or Jewish in origin). In the NSZ document Aleksander Kamiński was described as \"a Jew-lover who always inclined towards the extreme left-communist\".\n\nDuring the Warsaw uprising he continued to be the editor-in-chief of the \"Information Bulletin\" (which at that time was already published openly as a daily newspaper) until the last issue on 4 October 1944.\n\nOn 30 September 1944 the head of the Home Army Headquarters, Colonel Jan Rzepecki, alias \"Chairman\", applied for Kamiński's promotion to the rank of Second Lieutenant of the Polish Army (WP) Reserve. After the capitulation of the Warsaw Uprising, he was no longer involved in any underground activity.\n\nFrom May 1945 to 1950 Kamiński was an assistant at the faculties of social pedagogy and general pedagogy of the University of Łódź. In 1947 he received his PhD degree in philosophy after defending his dissertation \"The Scouting method in upbringing and schooling\".\n\nStill active in the ZHP: from January 1946 he was a member of the Ideological Commission and the Law and Promise of Scouting. By the ordinance of 12 January 1946, Kamiński was appointed a member of the Provisional General Scouting Council, and from March 1946, he was the Second Vice President of the Polish Scouting Association. In 1947 he was deprived of this position, and in January 1949 removed from the ZHP for ideological reasons. At the beginning of 1950, Kamiński was also removed from the University of Łódź. In 1951, all his works were withdrawn from Polish libraries and censored. Until 1956, under surveillance of the Security Office.\n\nKamiński returned to scouting in 1956, when the events of October 1956 brought renewal and hope for democratic change in the country. Kaminski participated in discussions on the situation in the scouting sector and the possibility of reactivating ZHP. On 26 November 1956, he met with a group of instructors representing the Kraków community, who were in the process of finalizing the reactivation of ZHP. They refused to support him in the implementation of his concept of reactivating scouting activities within the OHPL (Scouting Organization of the People's Republic of Poland), presenting their position (and evidence) that the only correct solution was to reactivate the ZHP (which they did on 4 December 1956). At that time, at the beginning of December, he held meetings with 25 instructors from the pre-war ZHP. Kamiński went with them to the meeting of OHPL activists in Łódź, which was transformed into the \"All-Poland Meeting of Scouting Activists\" (National Congress of Scouting Activists). He became a member of the Supreme Scouting Council and was later elected Chairman.\n\nHowever, Kamiński held the position of the Chairman of the Council for less than a year and a half. He resigned under pressure from the forces that sought to subjugate ZHP ideologically to the Polish United Workers' Party.\n\nIn 1958, Kamiński returned to work at the University of Łódź, where he headed the Department of Social Pedagogy. In 1958, he was a member of the National Committee of the Front of National Unity.\n\nIn 1959 he obtained his postdoctoral degree on the basis of his work \"Prehistory of Polish Youth Associations\", and in March 1969 he was awarded the title of Associate Professor.\n\nActive in the Polish Teachers Association and in the Polish Mental Hygiene Association, member of the Committee of Pedagogical and Psychological Sciences of the Polish Academy of Sciences. At the beginning of the 1970s, on the order of the authorities, Kamiński prepared a report on the consequences of possible introduction of work free Saturdays.\n\nAfter retiring in 1972, he returned to Warsaw, where he died on 15 March 1978. Buried at the Powązki Military Cemetery, Warsaw, in the quarters of the Home Army Scouting Battalion \"Zoska\" (A20-1-13). In the end Kamiński rested next to Rudy, Alek and Zośka, who were so close to him as the heroes of \"Stones for the Rampart\".\n\nOn 5 May 1991, the Yad Vashem Institute posthumously awarded Aleksander Kamiński the title of \"Righteous Among the Nations\" for his help given during the occupation to members of the Jewish scouts' organization and the Jewish resistance movement.\n\nOn 22 February 2008, on the Fraternal Thought Day, during the celebrations connected with the honorary patronage of 5 scouting organizations, the President of the Republic of Poland Lech Kaczyński posthumously awarded Aleksander Kamiński the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta.\n\n\n\n\nBy resolution of 9 January 2003, the Sejm of the Republic of Poland decided to designate the year 2003 as the Year of Aleksander Kamiński.\n\nOn 24 September 2005, the first monument in Poland to Aleksander Kamiński was unveiled in the Old Town Park in Łódź. Also in Łódź, on the wall of the house at No. 30, on the street bearing the name of Aleksander Kamiński, is a plaque commemorating his place of residence in the city. His bust is also located in the Royal Baths in Warsaw.\n\nIn 2014, Kamiński was a patron of the Łódź ZHP Banner, the Youth Palace in Katowice, 15 schools and 27 strains, teams and scout troups.\n"}

{"id": "36982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36982", "title": "Backronym", "text": "Backronym\n\nA backronym, or bacronym, is a constructed phrase that purports to be the source of a word that is an acronym. Backronyms may be invented with either serious or humorous intent, or they may be a type of false etymology or folk etymology.\n\nAn acronym is a word derived from the initial letters of the words of a phrase: For example, the word \"radar\" comes from \"radio detection and ranging\".\n\nBy contrast, a backronym is constructed by creating a new phrase to fit an already-existing word, name, or acronym. For example, the United States Department of Justice assigns to its Amber Alert program the meaning \"America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response,\" but the term originally referred to Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old abducted and murdered in Texas in 1996.\n\nBackronyms are often used for comedic effect, as when NASA named its ISS treadmill the Combined Operational Load-Bearing External Resistance Treadmill (C.O.L.B.E.R.T.) after Stephen Colbert. The backronym was a lighthearted compromise in recognition of the comedian's ability to sway NASA's online vote for the naming of an ISS module later named \"Tranquility\".\nThe word is a combination of \"backward\" and \"acronym\", and has been defined as a \"reverse acronym\". Its earliest known citation in print is as \"bacronym\" in the November 1983 edition of the \"Washington Post\" monthly neologism contest. The newspaper quoted winning reader Meredith G. Williams of Potomac, Maryland, defining it as the \"same as an acronym, except that the words were chosen to fit the letters\".\n\nBackronyms can be constructed for educational purposes, for example to form mnemonics. An example of such a mnemonic is the Apgar score, used to assess the health of newborn babies. The rating system was devised by and named after Virginia Apgar, but ten years after the initial publication, the backronym \"APGAR\" was coined in the US as a mnemonic learning aid: Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity and Respiration.\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs use backronyms as teaching tools, similar to slogans such as \"one day at a time\", or \"Let go, let God\", but often with an ironic edge. For example, a \"slip\" may be expanded as \"Sobriety Losing Its Priority\", and \"denial\" as \"Don't Even Notice I Am Lying\".\n\nBackronyms are also created as jokes or as slogans, often expressing consumer loyalties or frustration. For example, the name of the restaurant chain \"Arby's\" is a play on the letters \"RB\", referring to the company's founders, the Raffel brothers. An advertising campaign in the 1980s created a backronym with the slogan \"America’s Roast Beef, Yes Sir!\"\n\nSome backronyms name the subject to make obvious its purpose or characteristics; the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb (abbreviated MOAB) and others in the series were heavily promoted by the United States as the \"Mother of All Bombs\", a backronym during the Iraq War. US news coverage in the days leading up to the United States 2003 invasion of Iraq claimed \"Mother of All Bombs\" to be the US response to Saddam Hussein's phrase \"mother of all battles\" from the first Gulf War.\n\nIn commercial aviation, ETOPS is officially an acronym for Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards, defining safety standards for long-distance over-water flights by planes with only two engines, but in aviation vernacular, the colloquial backronym is \"Engines Turn Or Passengers Swim.\"\n\nMany companies or products have spawned multiple humorous backronyms, with positive connotations asserted by supporters or negative ones by detractors. For example, the car company Ford was said to stand for \"First On Race Day\", by aficionados, but disparaged as \"Fix Or Repair Daily\", by critics. Similar backronyms have been directed against many other automakers, such as \"Fix It Again Tony\" for Fiat.\n\nBackronyms have also been coined by military personnel during wartime. The backronym for Spam, \"Something Posing As Meat\", was said to have originated from jaundiced soldiers who were sick of eating canned meat. The British contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq was code-named \"Operation Telic\", meaning \"directed or tending to a definite end\", from the Greek word . The meaning was initially unknown but as initial planning took place over the Christmas 2002 period, the term became jokingly known amongst service personnel as a backronym for \"Tell Everyone Leave Is Cancelled\".\n\nBackronyms are sometimes created to name laws or programs. The official title of the USA PATRIOT Act, a 2001 Act of the U.S. Congress, is \"Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001\". Commentators have noted a trend among US lawmakers to devise names that form a desired acronym.\n\nSometimes a backronym is so commonly heard that it is widely but incorrectly believed to have been used in the formation of the original word, and amounts to a false etymology or an urban legend. Examples include \"posh\", an adjective describing stylish items or members of the upper class. A popular story derives the word as an acronym from \"Port Out, Starboard Home\", referring to nineteenth century first-class cabins on ocean liners, which were shaded from the sun on outbound voyages east (e.g. from Britain to India) and homeward heading voyages west.\nThe word's actual etymology is unknown, but more likely related to Romani \"påš xåra\" (\"half-penny\") or to Urdu (borrowed from Persian) \"safed-pōśh\" (one who wears \"white robes\"), a derogatory term for wealthy people.\n\nLexicographer Jesse Sheidlower writes in his book \"The F-Word\" that acronyms were rare in the English language prior to the twentieth century, and most etymologies of common words or phrases that suggest origin from an acronym are false.\n\nOther examples include the brand name \"Adidas\", named after company founder Adolf \"Adi\" Dassler but falsely believed to be an acronym for \"All Day I Dream About Sports\"; \"Wiki\", said to stand for \"What I Know Is\", but in fact derived from the Hawaiian phrase \"wiki-wiki\" meaning \"fast\"; or Yahoo!, sometimes claimed to mean \"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle\", but in fact chosen because Yahoo's founders liked the word's meaning of \"rude, unsophisticated, uncouth\".\n\nThe distress signal SOS is often believed to be an abbreviation for \"Save Our Ship\" or \"Save Our Souls\". In fact, it was chosen because it has a simple and unmistakable Morse code representation three dots, three dashes, three dots, all sent without any pauses between characters.\n"}

{"id": "32703814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32703814", "title": "Chirality", "text": "Chirality\n\nChirality is a property of asymmetry important in several branches of science. The word \"chirality\" is derived from the Greek (\"kheir\"), \"hand,\" a familiar chiral object.\n\nAn object or a system is \"chiral\" if it is distinguishable from its mirror image; that is, it cannot be superposed onto it. Conversely, a mirror image of an \"achiral\" object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object. A chiral object and its mirror image are called \"enantiomorphs\" (Greek, \"opposite forms\") or, when referring to molecules, \"enantiomers\". A non-chiral object is called \"achiral\" (sometimes also \"amphichiral\") and can be superposed on its mirror image. If the object is non-chiral and is imagined as being colored blue and its mirror image is imagined as colored yellow, then by a series of rotations and translations the two can be superposed, producing green, with none of the original colors remaining.\n\nThe term was first used by Lord Kelvin in 1893 in the second Robert Boyle Lecture at the Oxford University Junior Scientific Club which was published in 1894:\n\nHuman hands are perhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes. This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand. In mathematics, \"chirality\" is the property of a figure that is not identical to its mirror image.\n\nIn mathematics, a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by rotations and translations alone. For example, a right shoe is different from a left shoe, and clockwise is different from anticlockwise. See for a full mathematical definition.\n\nA chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word \"enantiomorph\" stems from the Greek (enantios) 'opposite' + (morphe) 'form'. A non-chiral figure is called achiral or amphichiral.\n\nThe helix (and by extension a spun string, a screw, a propeller, etc.) and Möbius strip are chiral two-dimensional objects in three-dimensional ambient space. The J, L, S and Z-shaped \"tetrominoes\" of the popular video game Tetris also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space.\n\nMany other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves, glasses (where two lenses differ in prescription), and shoes. A similar notion of chirality is considered in knot theory, as explained below.\n\nSome chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the right-hand rule.\n\nIn geometry a figure is achiral if and only if its symmetry group contains at least one \"orientation-reversing\" isometry.\nIn two dimensions, every figure that possesses an axis of symmetry is achiral, and it can be shown that every \"bounded\" achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry.\nIn three dimensions, every figure that possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry is achiral. There are, however, achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry.\nIn terms of point groups, all chiral figures lack an improper axis of rotation (S). This means that they cannot contain a center of inversion (i) or a mirror plane (σ). Only figures with a point group designation of C, C, D, T, O, or I can be chiral.\n\nA knot is called achiral if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called chiral. For example, the unknot and the figure-eight knot are achiral, whereas the trefoil knot is chiral.\n\nIn physics, chirality may be found in the spin of a particle, where the handedness of the object is determined by the direction in which the particle spins. Not to be confused with helicity, which is the projection of the spin along the linear momentum of a subatomic particle, chirality is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon like spin. Although both can have left-handed or right-handed properties, only in the massless case do they have a simple relation. In particular for a massless particle the helicity is the same as the chirality while for an antiparticle they have opposite sign.\n\nThe \"handedness\" in both chirality and helicity relate to the rotation of a particle while it proceeds in linear motion with reference to the human hands. The thumb of the hand points towards the direction of linear motion whilst the fingers curl into the palm, representing the direction of rotation of the particle (i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise). Depending on the linear and rotational motion, the particle can either be defined by left-handedness (ex. translating leftwards and rotating counterclockwise) or right-handedness (ex. translating in the right direction and rotating clockwise). A symmetry transformation between the two is called parity. Invariance under parity by a Dirac fermion is called \"chiral symmetry\".\n\nElectromagnetic wave propagation as handedness is wave polarization and described in terms of helicity (occurs as a helix). Polarization of an electromagnetic wave is the property that describes the orientation, i.e., the time-varying, direction (vector), and amplitude of the electric field vector. For a depiction, see the adjacent image.\n\nA \"chiral molecule\" is a type of molecule that has a non-superposable mirror image. The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the presence of an asymmetric carbon atom.\n\nThe term \"chiral\" in general is used to describe the object that is non-superposable on its mirror image.\n\nIn chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called enantiomers or optical isomers. Pairs of enantiomers are often designated as \"right-\", \"left-handed\" or if it has no bias achiral. As polarized light passes through a chiral molecule, the plane of polarization, when viewed along the axis toward the source, will be rotated in a clockwise (to the right) or anticlockwise (to the left). A right handed rotation is dextrorotary (d); that to the left is levorotary (l). The d- and l-isomers are the same compound but are called enantiomers. An equimolar mixture of the two optical isomers will produce no net rotation of polarized light as it passes through. Left handed molecules have l- prefixed to their names; d- is prefixed to right handed molecules.\n\nMolecular chirality is of interest because of its application to stereochemistry in inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, biochemistry, and supramolecular chemistry.\n\nMore recent developments in chiral chemistry include the development of chiral inorganic nanoparticles that may have the similar tetrahedral geometry as chiral centers associated with sp3 carbon atoms traditionally associated with chiral compounds, but at larger scale. Helical and other symmetries of chiral nanomaterials were also obtained.\n\nAll of the known life-forms show specific chiral properties in chemical structures as well as macroscopic anatomy, development and behavior. In any specific organism or evolutionarily related set thereof, individual compounds, organs, or behavior are found in the same single enantiomorphic form. Deviation (having the opposite form) could be found in a small number of chemical compounds, or certain organ or behavior but that variation strictly depends upon the genetic make up of the organism. From chemical level (molecular scale), biological systems show extreme stereospecificity in synthesis, uptake, sensing, metabolic processing. A living system usually deals with two enantiomers of same compound in a drastically different way.\n\nIn biology, homochirality is a common property of amino acids and carbohydrates. The chiral protein-making amino acids, which are translated through the ribosome from genetic coding, occur in the form. However, -amino acids are also found in nature. The monosaccharides (carbohydrate-units) are commonly found in -configuration. DNA double helix is chiral (as any kind of helix is chiral), and B-form of DNA shows a right-handed turn.\n\nSometimes, when two enantiomers of a compound found in organisms, they significantly differ in their taste, smell and other biological actions. For example, (+)-Limonene found in orange (causing its smell), and (–)-Limonene found in Lemons (causing its smell), show different smells due to different biochemical interactions at human nose. (+)-Carvone is responsible for the smell of Caraway seed oil whereas (–)-carvone is responsible for smell of Spearmint oil.\n\nAlso, for artificial compounds, including medicines, in case of chiral drugs, the two enantiomers sometimes show remarkable difference in effect of their biological actions. Darvon (Dextropropoxyphene) is a painkiller, whereas its enantiomer, Novrad (Levopropoxyphene) is an anti-cough agent. In case of Penicillamine, the S-isomer used in treatment of primary chronic arthritis, Whereas the R-isomer has no therapeutic effect as well as being highly toxic. In some cases the less therapeutically active enantiomer can cause side effects. For example, S-naproxen is an analgesic but the R-isomer cause renal problems. The naturally occurring plant form of alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) is RRR-α-tocopherol whereas the synthetic form (all-racemic vitamin E, or dl-tocopherol) is equal parts of the stereoisomers RRR, RRS, RSS, SSS, RSR, SRS, SRR and SSR with progressively decreasing biological equivalency, so that 1.36 mg of dl-tocopherol is considered equivalent to 1.0 mg of d-tocopherol.\nMacroscopic example of Chirality is found in plant kingdom, animal kingdom and all other groups of organism. A simple example is the coiling direction of any climber plants. It may be one of two possible type of helix.\nIn anatomy, chirality is found in the imperfect mirror image symmetry of many kinds of animal bodies. Organisms such as gastropods exhibit chirality in their coiled shells, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance. Over 90% of gastropod species have \"dextral\" (right-handed) shells in their coiling, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always \"sinistral\" (left-handed). A very few species (for example \"Amphidromus perversus\") show an equal mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals.\n\nIn humans, chirality (also referred to as \"handedness\" or \"laterality\") is an attribute of humans defined by their unequal distribution of fine motor skill between the left and right hands. An individual who is more dexterous with the right hand is called \"right-handed\", and one who is more skilled with the left is said to be \"left-handed\".

D. Hamilton published an influential paper on altruism in 1964 to explain why genetic kin tend to help each other. He argued that genetically related individuals are likely to carry the copies of the same alleles; thus, helping kin may ensure that copies of the actors' alleles pass onto next generations of both the recipient and the actor.\n\nWhile this became a widely accepted idea, it was less noted that Hamilton published a later paper that modified this view. This paper argues that by measuring the genetic relatedness between any two (randomly chosen) individuals of a population several times, we can identify an average level of relatedness. Theoretical models predict that (1) it is adaptive for an individual to be altruistic to any other individuals that are more closely related to it than this average level, and also that (2) it is adaptive for an individual to be spiteful against any other individuals that are less closely related to it than this average level. The indirect adaptive benefits of such acts can surpass certain costs of the act (either helpful or harmful) itself. Hamilton mentioned birds and fishes exhibiting infanticide (more specifically: ovicide) as examples for such behaviours.\n\nBriefly, an individual can increase the chance of its genetic alleles to be passed to the next generations either by helping those that are more closely related, or by harming those that are less closely related than relationship by chance.\n\nThough altruism and spitefulness appear to be two sides of the same coin, the latter is less accepted among evolutionary biologists.\n\nFirst, unlike the case with the beneficiary of an altruistic act, targets of aggression are likely to act in revenge: bites will provoke bites. Thus harming non-kin may be more costly than helping kins.\n\nSecond, presuming a panmictic population, the vast majority of pairs of individuals exhibit a roughly average level of relatedness. For a given individual, the majority of others are not worth helping or harming. While it is easy to identify the few most closely related ones (see: kin recognition), it is hard to identify the most genetically distant ones.\n\nMost terrestrial vertebrates exhibit a certain degree of site fidelity, so levels of kinship tend to correlate negatively with spatial distance. While this may provide some cues to identify the least related individuals, it may also ensure that non-kin rarely if ever meet each other.\n\nMany animal species exhibit infanticide, i.e. adults tend to kill the eggs or the offspring of conspecifics, even if they do not feed on them (in the absence of cannibalism). This form of spitefulness is relatively free from the threat of revenge – provided that the parents and relatives of the target are either weak or far away. Infanticide may not be a form of spite as in many cases the loss of offspring to the female brings it back into estrous providing a mating advantage to an infanticidal male. This is seen in lions. \n\nAn individual carrying a long-lasting infection of virulent pathogens may benefit from (1) channelling the flow of pathogens from its own body away from its kin and (2) directing them toward non-kin conspecifics. The adaptive nature of this behaviour has been supported by the analysis of theoretical models and also by the analyses of the behavioural repertoire of different animal species. Thus, tuberculosis-infected European badgers and rabies-infected dogs equally tend to emigrate from their natal ranges before starting to distribute the pathogens. Similarly, wild herds of Asian elephants tend to defecate into drinkwater holes apparently to keep rival herds away.\n\nThroughout human history, war often emerges as a costly form of aggression typically targeting the non-kin enemy. Naturally, most wars appear to be motivated by potential benefits other than the genetic. Nevertheless, the widespread occurrence of rape and infanticide during periods of war indicates Hamiltonian elements as well. Infanticide is a biologically spiteful action in that it costs the killer time and energy, and opens the killer to the threat of revenge, without any direct compensating benefits. Rape, by contrast, is not, in the strict definition of the word, biologically spiteful as it is likely to have a direct fitness increase on the rapist (by increasing his number of direct descendants in the next generation, should the victim fall pregnant).\n\nIt was recently suggested that spiteful motivations may also play a role in economic decisions.\n\nMoreover, another paper argues that the motivation for biological aggression – i.e. using pathogens as weapons – is an inherent and common aspect of the human behavioural repertoire. This argument contradicts the widespread belief that biological weapons are rare and aberrant tools of warfare and it is supported by the following observations:\n"}

{"id": "13779717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13779717", "title": "Historicity of the Book of Mormon", "text": "Historicity of the Book of Mormon\n\nMany members of the Latter Day Saint movement claim historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Most, but not all, Mormons hold the book's connection to ancient American history as an article of their faith. This view finds little acceptance outside of Mormonism. The theory that the Book of Mormon is an ancient American history has no academic and scientific credibility. Mormon apologists have proposed multiple theories to explain apparent inconsistencies with the archaeological, genetic, linguistic and other records.\n\nThe Book of Mormon gives an account of two civilizations formed by families who migrated to the Americas. One group of families came from Jerusalem in 600 BC and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. Another group came much earlier, when God confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel; that group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites. Latter Day Saints claim that these Lamanites are among the ancestors of the Native Americans.\n\nThe dominant and widely accepted view among Latter Day Saints is that the Book of Mormon is a true and accurate account of these ancient American civilizations whose religious history it documents. Joseph Smith, whom most Latter Day Saints believe to have translated the work, stated, \"I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.\" Unresolved issues of the book's historicity and the lack of supporting archaeological evidence have led some adherents to adopt the position that the Book of Mormon may have been the creation of Smith, but that it was nevertheless divinely inspired. Between these two views is the view held by some Latter Day Saints that the Book of Mormon is a divine work of a spiritual nature, written in ancient America, but that its purpose is to teach of Christ and not to be used as a guide for history, geology, archaeology, or anthropology.\n\nDiscussion regarding the historicity of the Book of Mormon often focuses on archaeological issues, some of which relate to the large size and the long time span of the civilizations mentioned in the book. A contemporary Mormon view is that these civilizations rose and fell in Mesoamerica. Civilizations of their magnitude and duration would be expected to leave extensive archaeological records. Several Mesoamerican civilizations did exist in the time period covered by the Book of Mormon, including the Olmec, Zapotec and Maya. The Olmec and Zapotec civilizations developed a writing system that may have served as the model for the later Mayan writing system, which became highly developed. The Maya developed a complex calendar and were advanced in astronomy and mathematics.\n\nThe Book of Mormon mentions several animals, plants, and technologies for which there is no evidence in pre-Columbian America. These include asses, cattle, milk, horses, oxen, sheep, swine, goats, elephants, wheat, barley, figs, silk, steel, bellows, brass, breast plates, chains, iron working, plows, swords, scimitars, and chariots. The Smithsonian Institution has stated that \"none of the principal food plants and domestic animals of the Old World (except the dog) were present in the New World before Columbus.\"\n\nAdherents of the Latter Day Saint movement give varied responses to these criticisms. Some point to what they claim is evidence for the presence of these items and locations. Others invoke the limited geography model, regarding the events of the Book of Mormon as taking place in such a geographically limited area that no evidence should be expected. Some counter that the words used in the Book of Mormon refer not to the animals, plants and technologies that presently exist but to other similar items that did exist at the time. These views are not directly supported by the LDS Church, but they do motivate archaeological efforts to further understand these situations, including research being performed by Brigham Young University (BYU) professors.\n\nIn 1955, Thomas Ferguson, a Latter Day Saint and the founder of the New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), with five years of funding from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), began to dig throughout Mesoamerica for evidence of the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims. In a 1961 newsletter, Ferguson predicted that although nothing had been found, the Book of Mormon cities would be found within ten years. In 1972, Christian scholar Hal Hougey wrote to Ferguson questioning the progress made, given the stated timetable in which the cities would be found. Replying to Hougey as well as secular and non-secular requests, Ferguson wrote in a letter dated June 5, 1972: \"Ten years have passed . ... I had sincerely hoped that Book-of-Mormon cities would be positively identified within 10 years—and time has proved me wrong in my anticipation.\"\n\nDuring the period of 1959–61, NWAF colleague Dee Green was editor of the \"BYU Archaeological Society Newsletter\" and had an article from it published in the summer of 1969 edition of \"\", pp 76–78 in which he acknowledged that the NWAF findings did not back up the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims. After this article and another six years of fruitless search, Ferguson published a 29-page paper in 1975 entitled, \"Written Symposium on Book-of-Mormon Geography: Response of Thomas S. Ferguson to the Norman & Sorenson Papers\" in which he concluded, \"I'm afraid that up to this point, I must agree with Dee Green, who has told us that to date there is no Book-of-Mormon geography\". Referring to his own paper, Ferguson wrote a 1976 letter in which he stated: \"The real implication of the paper is that you can't set the Book-of-Mormon geography down anywhere—because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archeology. I should say—what is in the ground will never conform to what is in the book.\"\n\nThe archaeological investigations of NWAF-sponsored projects have contributed towards the documentation and understanding of pre-Columbian societies, particularly in Mesoamerica. Currently, BYU maintains 86 documents on the work of the NWAF at the BYU NWAF website and these documents are used outside both BYU and the LDS Church by researchers.\n\nAn additional criticism of the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon concerns linguistics. According to the text, the Nephites and the Lamanites initially spoke Hebrew (600 BC) and might have spoken a modified Semitic language until at least 400 AD, when the Book of Mormon ends. The non-canonized introductory paragraph to the LDS Church 1981 edition of the Book of Mormon stated that the Lamanites were the \"principal ancestors of the American Indians\". No Semitic language is spoken natively in the Americas today, however, and there is no evidence that any Native American language has been influenced by any Semitic language at any point in its history. Historical linguists who specialize in the languages of Native America are in agreement that the languages of Native America cannot be proven to be related to each other within the last eight to ten thousand years, let alone within the last thousand. A common counterargument is that the Book of Mormon mentions contact with other civilizations that might have had their own non-Semitic languages that influenced or supplanted any Semitic language being spoken. Apologists point out that the introduction merely stated that the peoples mentioned in the Book of Mormon are the primary ancestors of the Native Americans; it did not claim that they are the sole ancestors.\n\nThe \"Anthon Transcript\" (also known as the \"Caractors\" document) is a small piece of paper on which Joseph Smith wrote several lines of characters. According to Smith, these characters were from the golden plates (the ancient record from which Smith claims to have translated the Book of Mormon) and represent the reformed Egyptian writing that was on the plates. This paper was then delivered to professor Charles Anthon, a well-known classical scholar of Columbia College, Columbia University, for an expert opinion on the authenticity of the characters and the translation. Adherents to the Book of Mormon claim that Anthon attested to the characters' authenticity in writing to Martin Harris but then ripped up his certification after hearing the story of Smith and the plates. Critics, and Anthon himself, claim that Anthon believed any idea of reformed Egyptian was a hoax all along and that Harris was being duped. Anthon's own accounts differ, however: in his first he states that he refused to give his opinion at all; in the second he declares that he gave his opinion \"without any hesitation\" with intent to expose the transcript as a fraud.\n\nThe Book of Mormon tells of the people of Jared, consisting of several families from the Tower of Babel, who migrated to America from the Old World before Abraham's time; a group including Lehi's family who migrated to America from Jerusalem around 600 BC; and another group (the people of Mulek) who migrated to America from Jerusalem about eight years later. Although the Book of Mormon makes no overt assertions regarding the migration or non-migration of other groups to America, an introductory paragraph added to the 1981 edition identifies the Lamanites as the \"principal ancestors of the American Indians.\" In 2007, this statement was changed to \"among the ancestors\".\n\nNorth American Indians are generally considered the genetic descendants of East Eurasian peoples. Several authors have published works that suggest that current studies of genetic anthropology using DNA evidence do not provide support for the Book of Mormon. To date there have been no DNA studies that link any Native American group with West Eurasia. Some Mormon researchers claim that it is not valid to use genetics to attempt to prove or disprove the historicity of the Book of Mormon, citing a lack of source genes and the improbability of tracing Israelite DNA even if present.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution issues a standard reply to requests for their opinion regarding the Book of Mormon as an archaeological or scientific guide. Prior to 1998, the statement denied any evidence for pre-Columbian contact between Old and New Worlds: \"Certainly there was no contact with the ancient Egyptians, Hebrews or other peoples of Western Asia or the Near East.\" In 1998, the Smithsonian began issuing a shorter letter without the detailed response found in the first letter, and limited its comment to briefly deny any use of the Book of Mormon as an archaeological guide by the institution. Some Mormons believe that this was in part due to a critique of their statement by John L. Sorenson.\n\nSince the time of its publication, most Latter Day Saints have viewed and explained the Book of Mormon as a comprehensive history of all Native Americans; this understanding of the Book of Mormon is referred to as the \"hemispheric model.\" Other Latter Day Saints, however, believe that the hemispheric model is an assumption not supported by a close reading of the text. B. H. Roberts states the inadequacy of the hemispheric model in \"Studies of the Book of Mormon\":\n\n[C]ould the people of Mulek and of Lehi ... part of the time numbering and occupying the land at least from Yucatan to Cumorah ... live and move and have their being in the land of America and not come in contact with other races and tribes of men, if such existed in the New World within Book of Mormon times? To make this seem possible the area occupied by the Nephites and Lamanites would have to be extremely limited, much more limited, I fear, than the Book of Mormon would admit our assuming.\nThe cities mentioned in the Book of Mormon have not been identified. Several groups of Mormon scholars and apologists, including the Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research (FAIR) and the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), have proposed that the city Zarahemla is located somewhere within Central America because of the description given in as a narrow neck of land bordering sea on the west and on the east. This approach, often referred to as the \"Limited Geography Model,\" argues for a more limited view of the Book of Mormon, suggesting that the book is a history of only a small group of Native Americans in Central America. This theory has been gaining substantial support among LDS scholars since the mid-1980s because it more accurately represents the descriptions given within the text itself. For instance, the populations and civilizations described in the Book of Mormon were likely too small (only a few million) to fill entire continents; moreover, there is much evidence that one common assumption of the past—that Book of Mormon civilizations were alone in America—is probably incorrect. Most LDS authors hold the belief that the Book of Mormon events took place within a limited region in Mesoamerica, and that others were present on the continent at the time of Lehi's arrival. This geographical and population model was formally published in an official church magazine, \"Ensign\", in a two-part series by John L. Sorenson published in September and October 1984. This was followed by a book on the subject by Sorenson in 1985.\n\nThe Gospel Topics essays section of the LDS official website hosts two essays entitled \"Book of Mormon and DNA Studies\" and \"Book of Mormon Translation\". These are some of the few official Church statements with regard to such historical issues.\n\n\n\n"}

She ran a major British Academy funded conference in 2012, \"Romosexuality,\" on the subject which has shed considerable light on the differences between Roman and Greek conceptions of homosexuality, and differences from modern conceptions. Previously most work on classical homosexuality focused on Greek homosexuality and its modern reception, but Ingleheart's work has facilitated new research and interest in the Roman experience. The modern reception of Roman homosexuality in particular has lead to Ingleheart's current work on, and translation of, AE Housman's \"Praefunda,\" a study of classical sexuality in Latin.\n\n\n\n"}

Perhaps the best known alleged example is the Glastonbury Temple of the Stars, situated around Glastonbury in Somerset, England. The temple is thought by some to depict a colossal zodiac.\n\nThe theory was first put forward in 1935 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist who \"discovered\" the zodiac in a vision, and held that the \"temple\" was created by Sumerians about 2700 BC. Interest was re-ignited in 1969 by Mary Caine in an article in the magazine \"Gandalf's Garden\".\n\nThe landscape zodiac plays an important role in many occult theories. It has been associated with the Celtic Saints, Grail legend and King Arthur (according to some legends buried in Glastonbury).\n\nThe idea was examined by two independent studies, one by Ian Burrow in 1975 and the other in 1983 by Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy, using the standard methods of landscape historical research. Both studies concluded that the evidence contradicted the idea. The eye of Capricorn identified by Maltwood was a haystack. The western wing of the Aquarius phoenix was a road laid in 1782 to run around Glastonbury, and older maps dating back to the 1620s show the road had no predecessors. The Cancer boat (not a crab as would be expected) is made up of a network of eighteenth century drainage ditches and paths. There are some Neolithic paths preserved in the peat of the bog formerly comprising most of the area, but none of the known paths match the lines of the zodiac features. There is no support for this theory, or for the existence of the \"temple\" in any form, from conventional archaeologists or mainstream historians.\n\nBeside the Glastonbury arrangement further zodiacs have been alleged in Britain in following years including:\n\n\nThere is rarely a strong scientific case for these discoveries. Their nebulous existence is in many ways similar to urban myths, ufology, or ley lines. They seem to play a part in personal belief systems, possibly as fictional devices; for example \"The Brighton Zodiac\" - created by Sally Hurst, based on the streets of that town - features as a plot device in Robert Rankin's novel \"The Brightonomicon\". Mark Valentine has compiled a checklist of 'The Literature of Terrestrial Zodiacs in Britain' in 'The Network of Ley Hunters' Newsletter'().\n\nIn the walks around the M25 motorway documented in psychogeographer Iain Sinclair's 2003 novel \"London Orbital\", the walkers trace the mythical Kingston upon Thames Zodiac.\n\n\n"}

He is one of the best known writers on the Perennial philosophy in the Portuguese language. His most recent book in English is \"Men of a Single Book: Fundamentalism in Islam, Christianity, and Modern Thought\" (United States, World Wisdom, 2010), which won in the \"Comparative Religion\" category of The USA \"Best Books 2011\" Awards. He has translated into Portuguese, from the original French, several of the books of the perennialist master Frithjof Schuon (1907–1998).\n\nSoares de Azevedo was born in the capital city of Minas Gerais state, in a family with roots in the historical city of Ouro Preto, where he lived his childhood. His family ancestors include Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, Minister of Justice and of Finance in the Empire, and governor of the province of Minas Gerais, and Diogo de Vasconcelos, renowned historian and politician, author of \"História Média de Minas Gerais\". In São Paulo, he attended gymnasium and high school at Colégio Santa Cruz, of French Canadian priests, and graduated in Literature and Journalism at the University of São Paulo (USP). He has a graduate degree in international relations from George Washington University and holds a master's degree in History of religions from the University of São Paulo, with a thesis on the contemporary relevance of the Perennial Philosophy.\n\nHe is the author of seven books on the philosophical and mystical dimensions of Christianity and Islam, and about one hundred articles and essays dealing with the Perennial Philosophy and traditional spirituality in the contemporary world, several of them translated into English, French, and Spanish.\n\nHis most recent book in English is \"Men of a Single Book: Fundamentalism in Islam, Christianity, and Modern Thought\" (United States, World Wisdom, 2010), a critique both of religious and anti-religious fundamentalism; the later represented specially by polemicists such as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. This book is the winner in the \"Comparative Religion\" category of The USA \"Best Books 2011\" Awards. It is also the ForeWord Book of the Year Award Finalist for \"Religion\", and Midwest Book Award Silver Medal for \"Current Events\".\n\nIn Portuguese, his latest work is \"O Livro dos Mestres\" (The Book of Masters. São Paulo: Ibrasa, 2016), which is composed of outlines of the messages of around twenty spiritual masters of recent times, from diverse religious traditions.\n\nAnother relatively recent book by Soares de Azevedo is \"Occultism and Religion in Freud, Jung, and Mircea Eliade\", co-authored with the Australian author and professor Harry Oldmeadow.\n\nHe lived a year in London, England, in the 1980s, where he experienced the intellectual impact of the work of French metaphysician René Guénon, which expounds a profound critique of modern materialism and relativism from a purely metaphysical perspective. In the 1990s, he lived a season in Washington, DC, and studied under William Stoddart, Rama Coomaraswamy, and Seyyed Hossein Nasr. There he deepened the study of the Perennial Philosophy and experienced the spiritual impact of the teachings of the German metaphysician and esoterist Frithjof Schuon. For Azevedo, the Perennial Philosophy casts a unique and contemporary light on the spiritual heritage of the peoples and updates the message of the traditional religions, especially Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism, giving to twenty-first century man a practical alternative to modern skepticism and intellectual confusion.\n\nIt is noteworthy to grasp that the precursors of the Perennial Philosophy are sapiential masters such as Plato, Pythagoras, Shankara, and Meister Eckhart, and that the foundations of this school of thought are in pure Metaphysics, or in the \"nature of things\", not in one of the great Revelations, notwithstanding the fact that the Perennial Philosophy prescribes the need for personal attachment to one of the orthodox religious forms.\n\nAzevedo absorbed elements both from Guénon and Schuon, as well as from William Stoddart, in his works, such as \"Men of a Single Book\" and \"Iniciación al Islam y al Sufism\". He is the editor of two anthologies published in the United States. The first is \"Ye Shall Know The Truth: Christianity And The Perennial Philosophy\", featuring works by Frithjof Schuon, René Guénon, Titus Burckhardt and other perennialists. The second is \"Remembering in a World of Forgetting: Thoughts on Tradition and Postmodernism\", a collection of the most important essays by the British perennialist author William Stoddart.\n\n\n\"Men of a Single Book\" received the following awards:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1007980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1007980", "title": "Notker the Stammerer", "text": "Notker the Stammerer\n\nNotker the Stammerer (; 840 – 6 April 912 AD), also called Notker I, Notker the Poet or Notker of Saint Gall, was a musician, author, poet, and Benedictine monk at the Abbey of Saint Gall, now in Switzerland. He is commonly accepted to be the \"Monk of Saint Gall\" (\"Monachus Sangallensis\") who wrote \"Gesta Karoli\", (the \"deeds of Charlemagne\").\n\nNotker was born around 840, to a distinguished family. He would seem to have been born at Jonschwil on the River Thur, south of Wil, in what would become much later (in 1803) the canton of Saint Gall in Switzerland; some sources claim Elgg to be his place of birth. He studied with Tuotilo at Saint Gall's monastic school, and was taught by , and the Irishman, Moengall. He became a monk there and is mentioned as librarian in 890 and as master of guests in 892–4. He was chiefly active as a teacher, and displayed refinement of taste as poet and author.\n\nEkkehard IV, the biographer of the monks of Saint Gall, lauds him as \"delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine, a vessel of the Holy Spirit without equal in his time\". He died in 912. He was beatified in 1512.\n\nHe completed Erchanbert's chronicle, arranged a martyrology, composed a metrical biography of Saint Gall, and authored other works.\n\nIn his martyrology, he appeared to corroborate one of St Columba's miracles. St Columba, being an important father of Irish monasticism, was also important to St Gall and thus to Notker's own monastery. Adomnan of Iona had written that at one point Columba had through clairvoyance seen a city in Italy near Rome being destroyed by fiery sulphur as a divine punishment and that three thousand people had perished. And shortly after Columba saw this, sailors from Gaul arrived to tell the news of it. Notker claimed in his martyrology that this event happened and that an earthquake had destroyed a city which was called 'new'. It is unclear what this city was that Notker was claiming, although some thought it may have been Naples (previously called 'Neapolis' - new city). However Naples was destroyed by a volcano in 512 before Columba was born, and not during Columba's lifetime.\n\nHis \"Liber Hymnorum\", created between 881 and 887, is an early collection of \"Sequences\", which he called \"hymns\", mnemonic poems for remembering the series of pitches sung during a melisma in plainchant, especially in the Alleluia. It is unknown how many or which of the works contained in the collection are his. The hymn \"Media Vita\", was erroneously attributed to him late in the Middle Ages.\n\nEkkehard IV wrote of fifty sequences composed by Notker. He was formerly considered to have been the inventor of the sequence, a new species of religious lyric, but this is now considered doubtful, though he did introduce the genre into Germany. It had been the custom to prolong the Alleluia in the Mass before the Gospel, modulating through a skillfully harmonized series of tones. Notker learned how to fit the separate syllables of a Latin text to the tones of this jubilation; this poem was called the sequence (q.v.), formerly called the \"jubilation\". (The reason for this name is uncertain.) From 881–7 Notker dedicated a collection of such verses to Bishop Liutward of Vercelli, but it is not known which or how many are his.\n\nThe \"Monk of Saint Gall\" (Latin: \"Monachus Sangallensis\"; the name is not contemporary, being given by modern scholars), the ninth-century writer of a volume of didactic eulogistic anecdotes regarding the Emperor Charlemagne, is now commonly believed to be Notker the Stammerer. This monk is known from his work to have been a native German-speaker, deriving from the Thurgau, only a few miles from the Abbey of Saint Gall; the region is also close to where Notker is believed to have derived from. The monk himself relates that he was raised by Adalbert, a former soldier who had fought against the Saxons, the Avars (\"Huns\" in his text) and the Slavs under the command of Kerold, brother of Hildegard, Charlemagne's second wife; he was also a friend of Adalbert's son, Werinbert, another monk at Saint Gall, who died as the book was in progress. His teacher was , the Abbot of Saint Gall from 841 to 872, who was, the monk claims, himself a pupil of Alcuin.\n\nThe monk's untitled work, referred to by modern scholars as \"De Carolo Magno\" (\"Concerning Charles the Great\") or \"Gesta Caroli Magni\" (\"The Deeds of Charles the Great\"), is not a biography but consists instead of two books of anecdotes relating chiefly to the Emperor Charlemagne and his family, whose virtues are insistently invoked. It was written for Charles the Fat, great-grandson of Charlemagne, who visited Saint Gall in 883. It has been scorned by traditional historians, who refer to the Monk as one who \"took pleasure in amusing anecdotes and witty tales, but who was ill-informed about the true march of historical events\", and describe the work itself as a \"mass of legend, saga, invention and reckless blundering\": historical figures are claimed as living when in fact dead; claims are attributed to false sources (in one instance, the Monk claims that \"to this King Pepin [the Short] the learned Bede has devoted almost an entire book of his \"Ecclesiastical History\"\"; no such account exists in Bede's history – unsurprisingly, given that Bede died in 735 during the reign of Charlemagne's grandfather Charles Martel); and Saint Gall is frequently referenced as a location in anecdotes, regardless of historical verisimilitude (Pepin the Hunchback, for example, is supposed to have been sent to Saint Gall as punishment for his rebellion, and – in a trope owed to Livy's tale of Tarquin and the poppies – earns a promotion to rich Prüm Abbey after advising Charlemagne through an implicit parable of hoeing thistles to execute another group of rebels). The Monk also mocks and criticizes bishops and the prideful, high-born incompetent, showy in dress and fastidious and lazy in habits, whilst lauding the wise and skillful government of the Emperor with nods to the deserving poor. Several of the Monk's tales, such as that of the nine rings of the Avar stronghold, have been used in modern biographies of Charlemagne.\n\nThe Monk of Saint Gall is commonly believed to be Notker the Stammerer: Louis Halphen has delineated the points of similarity between the two: the Monk claims to be old, toothless and stammerering; and both share similar interests in church music, write with similar idioms, and are fond of quoting Virgil. The text is dated to the 880s from mentions in it of Carloman (died 880), half-brother of Charles the Fat, the \"circumscribed lands\" of Carloman's son Arnulf, who succeeded as King of the Germans in 887, and the destruction of Prüm Abbey, which occurred in 882.\n\n\n, translated by A.J.

In keeping with the common practice of the day he Latinized his name to Petrus Albinus. After attending grammar school in Schneeberg and princely school at Meissen, Albinus studied in Leipzig, received his bachelor's degree in 1553 and worked in Lauban. In 1559 he moved to the University of Viadrina in Frankfurt/Oder, and in 1564 the Leucorea in Wittenberg. He focused mainly on legal and historical research.\n\nIn Wittenberg he took over the task of completing the history of Upper Saxony and the House of Wettin begun by Georg Fabricius.

{"id": "436374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436374", "title": "Polish Golden Age", "text": "Polish Golden Age\n\nThe Polish Golden Age refers to the period from the late 15th century Jagiellon Poland to the death of the last of the Jagiellons, Sigismund August in 1572. Some historians claim that the Golden Age lasted until the mid-17th century, when in 1648 the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was ravaged by the Khmelnytsky Uprising, and Swedish invasion. During its Golden Age, the Commonwealth became one of the largest kingdoms of Europe, stretching from modern-day Estonia, to Moldavia and Silesia. Its army was able to defend the realm against numerous Teutonic knights, Turkish, Swedish, Russian, and Tatar invasions. The country prospered thanks to its enormous grain, wood and salt exports.\n\nIn the 16th century, the area of the Commonwealth reached almost 1 million km, with a population of 11 million. Its goods were transported to Western Europe via Baltic Sea ports of Gdańsk, Elbląg, Riga, Memel and Königsberg. The Commonwealth had several major cities, such as Warsaw, Kraków, Poznań, Lviv, Vilnius, Toruń and Kiev.\n\nDuring the Golden Age the Commonwealth was regarded as one of the most powerful European states. It had a unique system of government, known as the Golden Liberty, in which all nobles (szlachta), regardless of economic status, were considered to have equal legal status and enjoyed extensive legal rights and privileges. One of its features was the Liberum veto, used for the first time in 1653. Nobility, which consisted of both szlachta and magnates, made up approximately 8-10% of the population.\n\nIn the early 16th century the situation for peasants was relatively good, but they deteriorated over the course of the time. Poverty was widespread, peasants were forced to work for the nobility (see serfdom), which resulted in them escaping in large numbers to the forests, hills and Wild Fields in the Ukraine, where they joined the Cossacks.\n\nThe Polish printing industry began in Kraków in 1473, and by the early 17th century there were about 20 printing houses within the Commonwealth: eight in Kraków, the rest mostly in Gdańsk, Toruń and Zamość. The Academy of Kraków possessed well-stocked libraries; smaller collections were increasingly common at noble courts, schools, and in townspeople's households. Illiteracy levels were falling, as by the end of the 16th century almost every parish ran a school.\n\nThe Lubrański Academy, an institution of higher learning, was established in Poznań in 1519. The Reformation resulted in the establishment of a number of gymnasiums, academically oriented secondary schools, some of international renown, as the Protestant denominations wanted to attract supporters by offering high quality education. The Catholic reaction was the creation of Jesuit colleges of comparable quality. The Kraków University in turn responded with humanist program gymnasiums of its own.\n\nThe university itself experienced a period of prominence at the turn of the 15th/16th century, when especially the mathematics, astronomy and geography faculties attracted numerous students from abroad. Latin, Greek, Hebrew and their literatures were likewise popular. By the mid 16th century the institution entered a crisis stage, and by the early 17th century regressed into Counter-reformational conformism. The Jesuits took advantage of the infighting and established in 1579 a university college in Vilnius, but their efforts aimed at taking over the Academy of Kraków were unsuccessful. Under the circumstances many elected to pursue their studies abroad.\n\nSigismund I the Old, who built the presently existing Wawel Renaissance castle, and his son Sigismund II Augustus, supported intellectual and artistic activities and surrounded themselves with the creative elite. Their patronage example was followed by ecclesiastic and lay feudal lords, and by patricians in major towns.\n\nPolish science reached its culmination in the first half of the 16th century as the medieval point of view was criticized and more rational explanations were sought. \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\", published by Copernicus in Nuremberg in 1543, shook up the traditional value system extended into understanding of the physical universe, dispensing with the Christianity-adopted Ptolemaic anthropocentric model and setting free the expansion of scientific inquiry. Generally the prominent scientists of the period resided in many different regions of the country, and increasingly, the majority were of urban, rather than noble origin.\n\nCopernicus, a son of a Toruń trader from Kraków, made many contributions to science and the arts. His scientific creativity was inspired at the University of Kraków, he later studied at Italian universities. Copernicus wrote Latin poetry, developed an economic theory, functioned as a cleric-administrator, a political activist in Prussian sejmiks, and he led the defense of Olsztyn against the forces of Albrecht Hohenzollern. As an astronomer, he worked on his scientific theory for many years at Frombork, where he died.\n\nJosephus Struthius became famous as a physician and medical researcher. Bernard Wapowski was a pioneer of Polish cartography. Maciej Miechowita, a rector at the Cracow Academy, published in 1517 \"Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis\", a treatise on the geography of the East, an area in which Polish investigators provided first-hand expertise for the rest of Europe.\n\nAndrzej Frycz Modrzewski was one of the greatest theorists of political thought in Renaissance Europe. His most famous work, \"On the Improvement of the Commonwealth\", was published in Kraków in 1551. Modrzewski criticized the feudal societal relations and proposed broad realistic reforms. He postulated that all social classes should be subjected to the law to the same degree, and wanted to moderate the existing inequities. Modrzewski, an influential and often translated author, was a passionate proponent of peaceful resolution of international conflicts. Bishop Wawrzyniec Goślicki (Goslicius), who wrote and published in 1568 a study entitled \"De optimo senatore\" (\"The Counsellor\" in the 1598 English translation), was another popular and influential in the West political thinker.\n\nHistorian Marcin Kromer wrote \"De origine et rebus gestis Polonorum\" (On the origin and deeds of Poles) in 1555 and in 1577 \"Polonia\", a treatise highly regarded in Europe. Marcin Bielski's \"Chronicle of the Whole World\", a universal history, was written ca. 1550. The chronicle of Maciej Stryjkowski (1582) covered the history of Eastern Europe.\n\nModern Polish literature begins in the 16th century. At that time the Polish language, common to all educated groups, matured and penetrated all areas of public life, including municipal institutions, the legal code, the Church and other official uses, coexisting for a while with Latin. Klemens Janicki, one of the Renaissance Latin language poets, a laureate of a papal distinction, was of peasant origin. Another plebeian author, Biernat of Lublin, wrote his own version of Aesop's fables in Polish, permeated with his socially radical views.\n\nA Literary Polish language breakthrough came under the influence of the Reformation with the writings of Mikołaj Rej. In his \"Brief Discourse\", a satire published in 1543, he defends a serf from a priest and a noble, but in his later works he often celebrates the joys of the peaceful but privileged life of a country gentleman. Rej, whose legacy is his unbashful promotion of the Polish language, left a great variety of literary pieces.Łukasz Górnicki, an author and translator, perfected the Polish prose of the period. His contemporary and friend Jan Kochanowski became one of the greatest Polish poets of all time.\n\nKochanowski was born in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the universities of Kraków, Königsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. He worked for a time as a royal secretary, and then settled in the village of Czarnolas, a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski's multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth of thoughts and feelings that he shares with the reader, and for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski's best known works are bucolic \"Frascas\" (trifles),epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy \"The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys\", and the most highly regarded \"Threnodies\" or laments, written after the death of his young daughter. The poet Mikołaj Sęp Szarzyński, an intellectually refined master of small forms, bridges the late Renaissance and early Baroque artistic periods.\n\nFollowing the European and Italian in particular musical trends, the Renaissance music was developing in Poland, centered around the royal court patronage and branching from there. Sigismund I kept from 1543 a permanent choir at the Wawel castle, while the Reformation brought large scale group Polish language church singing during the services. Jan of Lublin wrote a comprehensive tablature for the organ and other keyboard instruments. Among the composers, who often permeated their music with national and folk elements, were Wacław of Szamotuły, Mikołaj Gomółka, who wrote music to Kochanowski translated psalms, and Mikołaj Zieleński, who enriched the Polish music by adopting the Venetian School polyphonic style.\n\nArchitecture, sculpture and painting developed also under Italian influence from the beginning of the 16th century. A number of professionals from Tuscany arrived and worked as royal artists in Kraków. Francesco Fiorentino had started work on the tomb of Jan Olbracht in 1502, and then together with Bartolommeo Berrecci and Benedykt from Sandomierz rebuilt the royal castle between 1507 and 1536. Berrecci also built Sigismund's Chapel at Wawel Cathedral. Polish magnates, Silesian Piast princes in Brzeg, and even Kraków merchants (by the mid 16th century their class had gained economic strength nationwide) built or rebuilt their residences to make them resemble the Wawel Castle. Kraków's Sukiennice and Poznań City Hall are among numerous buildings rebuilt in the Renaissance manner, but Gothic construction continued alongside for a number of decades.\n\nBetween 1580 and 1600 Jan Zamoyski commissioned the Venetian architect Bernardo Morando to build the city of Zamość. The town and its fortifications were designed to consistently implement the Renaissance and Mannerism aesthetic paradigms. Tombstone sculpture, often inside churches, is richly represented on graves of clergy and lay dignitaries and other wealthy individuals. Jan Maria Padovano and Jan Michałowicz of Urzędów count among the prominent artists.\n\nPainted illuminations in Balthasar Behem Codex are of exceptional quality, and draw their inspiration largely from Gothic art. Stanisław Samostrzelnik, a monk in the Cistercian monastery in Mogiła near Kraków, painted miniatures and polychromed wall frescos.\n\nAt the end of the 15th century, the Jagiellonians reigned over vast territories stretching from the Baltic to the Black to the Adriatic Sea. The dynasty reigned in several Central European countries between the 14th and 16th centuries. Members of the dynasty were Kings of Poland (1386–1572), Grand Dukes of Lithuania (1377–1392 and 1440–1572), Kings of Hungary (1440–1444 and 1490–1526), and Kings of Bohemia (1471–1526).\n\nIn 1515, during a congress in Vienna, a dynastic succession arrangement was agreed to between Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and the Jagiellon brothers, Vladislas II of Bohemia and Hungary and Sigismund I of Poland and Lithuania. It was supposed to end the Emperor's support for Poland's enemies, the Teutonic and Russian states, but after the election of Charles V, Maximilian's successor in 1519, the relations with Sigismund had worsened.\n\nThe Jagiellon rivalry with the House of Habsburg in central Europe was ultimately resolved to the Habsburgs' advantage. The decisive factor that damaged or weakened the monarchies of the last Jagiellons was the Ottoman Empire's Turkish expansion. Hungary's vulnerability greatly increased after Suleiman the Magnificent took the Belgrade fortress in 1521. To prevent Poland from extending military aid to Hungary, Suleiman had a Tatar-Turkish force raid southeastern Poland–Lithuania in 1524. The Hungarian army was defeated in 1526 at the Battle of Mohács, where the young Louis II Jagiellon, son of Vladislas II, was killed. Subsequently, after a period of internal strife and external intervention, Hungary was partitioned between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans.\n\nBy the Union of Lublin a unified Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (\"Rzeczpospolita\") was created in 1569, stretching from the Baltic Sea and the Carpathian mountains to present-day Belarus and western and central Ukraine (which earlier had been Kievan Rus' principalities). Within the new federation some degree of formal separation of Poland and Lithuania was retained (distinct state offices, armies, treasuries and judicial systems), but the union became a multinational entity with a common monarch, parliament, monetary system and foreign-military policy, in which only the nobility enjoyed full citizenship rights. Moreover, the nobility's uppermost stratum was about to assume the dominant role in the Commonwealth, as magnate factions were acquiring the ability to manipulate and control the rest of \"szlachta\" to their clique's private advantage. This trend, facilitated further by the liberal settlement and land acquisition consequences of the union, became apparent around the time of the 1572 death of Sigismund Augustus, the last monarch of the Jagiellonian dynasty.\n\nOne of the most salient characteristics of the newly established Commonwealth was its multiethnicity, and accordingly diversity of religious faiths and denominations. Among the peoples represented were Poles (about 50% or less of the total population), Lithuanians, Latvians, Rus' people (corresponding to today's Belarusians, Ukrainians, Russians or their East Slavic ancestors), Germans, Estonians, Jews, Armenians, Tatars and Czechs, among others, for example smaller West European groups. As for the main social segments in the early 17th century, nearly 70% of the Commonwealth's population were peasants, over 20% residents of towns, and less than 10% nobles and clergy combined. The total population, estimated at 8–10 millions, kept growing dynamically until the middle of the century. The Slavic populations of the eastern lands, Rus' or Ruthenia, were solidly, except for the Polish colonizing nobility (and Polonized elements of local nobility), Eastern Orthodox, which portended future trouble for the Commonwealth.\n\nThe political doctrine of the Commonwealth was: \"our state is a republic under the presidency of the King\". Chancellor Jan Zamoyski summed up this doctrine when he said that \"Rex regnat et non-gubernat\" (\"The King reigns but [\"lit.\" 'and'] does not govern\").The Commonwealth had a parliament, the Sejm, as well as a \"Senat\" and an elected king (\"Pic. 1\"). The king was obliged to respect citizens' rights specified in King Henry's Articles as well as in \"Pacta conventa\", negotiated at the time of his election.\n\nThe monarch's power was limited in favor of a sizable noble class. Each new king had to pledge to uphold the Henrician Articles, which were the basis of Poland's political system (and included near-unprecedented guarantees of religious tolerance). Over time, the Henrician Articles were merged with the Pacta Conventa, specific pledges agreed to by the king-elect. From that point onwards, the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and was constantly supervised by a group of senators. The Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including legislation (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war, and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones).\n\nThe foundation of the Commonwealth's political system, the \"Golden Liberty\" (Polish: \"Złota Wolność\", a term used from 1573 on), included:\n\nIn the 16th century the Grand Duchy of Lithuania became increasingly interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially to gain control of Baltic seaports, such as Riga, and for other economic benefits. Livonia was by the 1550s largely Lutheran, traditionally ruled by the Brothers of the Sword knightly order. This put Poland and Lithuania on a collision course with Moscow and other regional powers, which had also attempted expansion in that area.\n\nOther powers aspiring to the Livonian Baltic access responded by partitioning the Livonian state, which triggered the lengthy Livonian War, fought between 1558 and 1583. Ivan IV of Russia took Dorpat (Tartu) and Narva in 1558, and soon the Danes and Swedes had occupied other parts of the country. To protect the integrity of their country, the Livonians sought a union with the Polish–Lithuanian state. Gotthard Kettler, the new Grand Master, met in Vilnius (Vilna, Wilno) with Sigismund Augustus in 1561 and declared Livonia a vassal state under the Polish King. The agreement of November 28 called for secularization of the Brothers of the Sword Order and incorporation of the newly established Duchy of Livonia into the \"Rzeczpospolita\" (\"Republic\") as an autonomous entity. The Union of Vilnius also created the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia as a separate fief, to be ruled by Kettler. Sigismund II obliged himself to recover the parts of Livonia lost to Moscow and the Baltic powers. These conflicts led to grueling wars with Russia (1558–1570 and 1577–1582) and other struggles over control of Baltic trade and freedom of navigation.\n\nThe Baltic region policies of the last Jagiellon king and his advisors were the most mature of the 16th century Poland's strategic programs. The outcome of the efforts in that area was to a considerable extent successful for the Commonwealth. The Livonian wars came to a conclusion under the reign of King Stephen Báthory.\n\nIn 1576, Stephen Báthory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania. He turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish–Polish–Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland–Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland–Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.\n\nJohn III of Sweden married Catherine Jagellonka, the sister of Sigismund II Augustus of Poland. When Sigismund II of Poland died without issue, the son of John III of Sweden and Catherine Jagellonka was elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania as Sigismund III in 1587. On John's death, Sigismund also gained the Swedish throne.\n\nAfter the death of John III of Sweden, his son Sigismund became heir to the throne of Sweden. Sigismund at that time was already the elected King of Poland (since 1587). Sigismund certainly valued the Swedish throne and upon learning about the death of his father, and the pretensions to the throne of his uncle, Duke Charles of Södermanland, he asked the Sejm (Polish parliament) for permission to leave the Commonwealth and go to Sweden, where he could secure the Swedish crown. The Sejm gave him permission, and on 3 August 1593, Sigismund, accompanied by his wife, Anna of Habsburg, and other followers, departed for Sweden.\n\nThe agreement of 19 February seemed to have calmed the situation; Sigismund was crowned in the Cathedral of Uppsala and became the king of Sweden. The Kingdom of Sweden was now in a personal union with Poland-Lithuania. In July, Sigismund left Sweden in the hands of the regency council and returned to Poland. Sweden was to be ruled jointly by the Privy Council of Sweden and Sigismund's uncle Duke Charles.\n\nSigismund, however, reneged on his earlier promises, opening Catholic schools, and giving Catholics prominent posts. Charles in turn did not give up on acquiring the Swedish throne and pursued his own political agenda. The new Riksdag he summoned at Arboga in 1597 – again despite the King's orders – saw few participants, and only one from the Privy Council. Even so, Duke Charles did not achieve support for his military action, but initiated it nonetheless. Parts of southern Sweden were successfully taken. Several of the Privy Council members fled to Poland to convince Sigismund to take counteractions. Sigismund sent a diplomatic mission, in an attempt to solve the conflict by negotiations. Charles at first looked ready to negotiate but in fact he was playing for time, trying to confirm his power at another Riksdag (in Arboga), recruiting peasants for his army, and isolating Sigismund's followers.\n\nIn 1598, the Sejm gave Sigismund the go-ahead to wage a military campaign against his opponents in Sweden; however it refused to give him significant support. Sigismund's army was composed mostly of mercenaries (Germans and Hungarians), supported by a relatively small Polish force (although with some artillery).\n\nSigismund's campaign was poorly planned. He was unable to coordinate his troop movements with his supporters, particularly Fleming who was supposed to attack Charles from Finland. After initial successes (the taking of Kalmar and defeating Charles' troops at Stegeborg), Sigismund's forces were defeated on September 25, 1598, at the Battle of Stångebro, (also known as the battle of Linköping). Sigismund was captured and forced to hand over some of his followers such as the Chancellor of Sweden, Erik Larsson Sparre, (1550–1600). In May 1599, Charles' forces captured the last fortress held by Sigismund, Kalmar. On July 24, 1599, the Riksdag in Stockholm officially dethroned Sigismund. The new King of Sweden was Charles IX of Sweden, and the Polish–Swedish union was dissolved after barely seven years of existence.In March 1600, some of Sigismund's supporters were executed, including five senators in an event known as the Linköping Bloodbath.\n\nThe Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618), in Poland known as the \"Dimitriads\", was a sequence of military conflicts and eastward invasions carried out by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and private armies and mercenaries led by the Commonwealth aristocracy), when the Russian Tsardom was torn by a series of civil wars, a period referred to as the \"Time of Troubles\". The sides and their goals changed several times during this conflict: the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was not formally at war with Russia until 1609, and various Russian factions fought amongst themselves, allied with the Commonwealth and other countries or fighting against them. Sweden also participated in the conflict during the course of the Ingrian War (1610–1617), sometimes allying itself with Russia, and other times fighting against it. The aims of the various factions changed frequently as well as the scale of their goals, which ranged from minor border adjustments to imposing the Polish Kings or the Polish-backed impostors' claims to the Russian throne and even the creation of a new state by forming a union between the commonwealth and Russia.\n\nThe war can be divided into four stages. In the first stage, certain commonwealth szlachta (nobility), encouraged by some Russian boyars (Russian aristocracy), but without the official consent of the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa, attempted to exploit Russia's weakness and intervene in its civil war by supporting the impostors for the tsardom, False Dmitriy I and later False Dmitriy II, against the crowned tsars, Boris Godunov and Vasili Shuiski. The first wave of the Polish intervention began in 1605 and ended in 1606 with the death of False Dmitri I. The second wave started in 1607 and lasted until 1609, when Tsar Vasili made a military alliance with Sweden. In response to this alliance, the Polish king Sigismund III decided to intervene officially and to declare war upon Russia, aiming to weaken Sweden's ally and to gain territorial concessions.\n\nHetman of the Crown Stanisław Żółkiewski held a triumphal entry by the Kraków suburb of the Royal Palace, leading with him the prisoners: the Russian tsar Wasyl IV Szujski, his brothers: Dimitri Szujski with his wife - Grand Duchess Ekaterina Grigoryevna, daughter Grigory Malyuta Skuratov and Ivan Shuysky Mikhail Shein, and Filaret, the non-canonical Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia .\n\nAfter early commonwealth victories (Battle of Klushino), which culminated in Polish forces entering Moscow in 1610, Sigismund's son, Prince Władysław of Poland, was briefly elected tsar. However, soon afterwards, Sigismund decided to seize the Russian throne for himself. This alienated the pro-Polish supporters among the boyars, who could accept the moderate Władysław, but not the pro-Catholic and anti-Eastern Orthodox Sigismund. Subsequently, the pro-Polish Russian faction disappeared, and the war resumed in 1611, with the Poles being ousted from Moscow in 1612 but capturing the important city of Smolensk (see \"Siege of Smolensk (1609–1611)\"). However, due to internal troubles in both the Commonwealth and Russia, little military action occurred between 1612 and 1617, when Sigismund made one final and failed attempt to conquer Russia. The war finally ended in 1618 with the Truce of Deulino, which granted the Commonwealth certain territorial concessions, but not control over Russia which thus emerged from the war with its independence unscathed.\n\n"}

A focus of his socio-historical research is on the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) which is where, before reunification, he lived and worked.\n\nStefan Wolle was born in Halle. He father was a committed supporter of East Germany's recently constructed ruling party. He attended school in Berlin and embarked on a traineeship in the book trade. After undertaking his military service he was enrolled at Berlin's Humboldt University to study historical sciences. However, in 1972 he was released from the university on account of his \"intellectual arrogance\". However, he was subsequently permitted to return and pursue his studies at the Humboldt between 1973 and 1976. He still had not become a member of the Socialist Unity Party (\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\" / SED), and never would: he spent the next thirteen years as an academic researcher, attached to the Central Historical Institute and the Institute for General History at the (East) German Academy of Sciences.\n\nWolle received his doctorate in 1984 for work on Vladimir the Great of Kievan Rus', consciously selected as a non-ideological topic, and reworked for publication as a book in 1993. He came to wider prominence in the context of the Peaceful Revolution which was followed by German reunification, formally in October 1990. During the second half of the 1980s he had been establishing contacts with underground opposition groups, and after the wall was breached in November 1989 he was able to become a expert witness on . He was also a member of the \"Normannenstraße Citizens Committee\". He was tasked, together with , with ensuring the preservation of files at the Stasi national centre in Normannenstraße as the Stasi operation itself was dissolved. During a period of rapid change, in January 1990 by concerned citizens (taking their queue from similar actions in Erfurt, Lepizig and Rostock) of the building housing the archives, thwarted a more extensive destruction of the evidence. In March 1990 Wolle and , using their access to the files, published a first edition of Stasi reports and instructions. 200,000 copies were printed within a few days and by July 1990 250,000 had been produced. The question of what to do with the Stasi archives had become pressing very quickly because of the extent and nature of government surveillance over citizens in East Germany between 1949 and 1989: in March 1990 a more structured approach to the archives began to emerge. Stefan Wolle served as a member of what became known as the Stasi Records Agency (\"Bundesbeauftragter für die Stasi-Unterlagen\" / BStU / \"Gauck commission\") between March 1990 and February 1991.\n\nIn February or March 1991 Wolle and Mitter were summarily dismissed from the Stasi Records Agency for \"disloyalty\". The dismissal came at the behest of Wolfgang Schäuble, at that time Interior Minister in the German government, and followed a television interview in which Wolle had disclosed that the name of the last East German prime minister, Lothar de Maizière, had appeared in Stasi files listing informal Stasi collaborators. (Schäuble's intervention appeared to have arisen because the disclosure about de Maizière directly contradicted public assurances previously given by Schäuble in respect of the matter.) The dismissal had been implemented by Joachim Gauck, then head of the Stasi Records Agency. Writing later in a memoir, Gauck recalled his very deep regret over the affair: he had been given no choice, and had indeed tried to reinstate Wolle at a later date.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1996 Wolle was engaged as an academic research assistant at the Humboldt University. Between 1996 and 1998 his work was funded by the German Research Foundation (\"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\" / DFG). Between 1998 and 2000 he worked with the National Foundation for the Evaluation of the SED Dictatorship (\"Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur\").

{"id": "619119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=619119", "title": "Trophy", "text": "Trophy\n\nA trophy is a tangible, durable reminder of a specific achievement, and serves as recognition or evidence of merit. Trophies are often awarded for sporting events, from youth sports to professional level athletics. In many sports medals (or, in North America, rings) are often given out either as the trophy or along with more traditional trophies.\n\nOriginally the word trophy, derived from the Greek \"tropaion\", referred to arms, standards, other property, or human captives and body parts (e.g., headhunting) captured in battle. These war trophies commemorated the military victories of a state, army or individual combatant. In modern warfare trophy taking is discouraged, but this sense of the word is reflected in hunting trophies and human trophy collecting by serial killers.\n\nA slang term for an individual or team's collection of trophies is silverware.\n\nTrophies have marked victories since ancient times. The word \"trophy\", coined in English in 1550, was derived from the French \"trophée\" in 1513, \"a prize of war\", from Old French \"trophee\", from Latin \"trophaeum\", monument to victory, variant of \"tropaeum\", which in turn is the latinisation of the Greek τρόπαιον (\"tropaion\"), the neuter of τροπαῖος (\"tropaios\"), \"of defeat\" or \"for defeat\", but generally \"of a turning\" or \"of a change\", from τροπή (\"tropē\"), \"a turn, a change\" and that from the verb τρέπω (\"trepo\"), \"to turn, to alter\".\n\nIn ancient Greece, trophies were made on the battlefields of victorious battles, from captured arms and standards, and were hung upon a tree or a large stake made to resemble a warrior. Often, these ancient trophies were inscribed with a story of the battle and were dedicated to various gods. Trophies made about naval victories sometimes consisted of entire ships (or what remained of them) laid out on the beach. To destroy a trophy was considered a sacrilege.\n\nThe ancient Romans kept their trophies closer to home. The Romans built magnificent trophies in Rome, including columns and arches atop a foundation. Most of the stone trophies that once adorned huge stone memorials in Rome have been long since stolen.\n\nIn ancient Greece, the winners of the Olympic games initially received no trophies except laurel wreaths. Later the winner also received an amphora with sacred olive oil. In local games, the winners received different trophies, such as a tripod vase, a bronze shield or a silver cup.\n\nIn ancient Rome, money usually was given to winners instead of trophies.\n\nChalices were given to winners of sporting events at least as early as the very late 1600s in the New World. For example, the Kyp Cup (made by silversmith Jesse Kyp), a small, two-handled, sterling cup in the Henry Ford Museum, was given to the winner of a horse race between two towns in New England in about 1699. Chalices, particularly, are associated with sporting events, and were traditionally made in silver. Winners of horse races, and later boating and early automobile races, were the typical recipients of these trophies. The Davis Cup, Stanley Cup, America's Cup and numerous World Cups are all now famous cup-shaped trophies given to sports winners.\n\nToday, the most common trophies are much less expensive, and thus much more pervasive, thanks to mass-produced plastic/resin trophies.\n\nThe oldest sports trophies in the world are the Carlisle Bells, a horse racing trophy dating back to 1559 and 1599 and were first awarded by Elizabeth I. The race has been run for over 400 years in Carlisle, Cumbria, United Kingdom. The bells are on show at the local museum, Tullie House, which houses a variety of historic artifacts from the area from Roman legions to present day.\n\nContemporary trophies often depict an aspect of the event commemorated, for example in basketball tournaments, the trophy takes the shape of a basketball player, or a basketball. Trophies have been in the past objects of use such as two-handled cups, bowls, or mugs (all usually engraved); or representations such as statues of people, animals, and architecture while displaying words, numbers or images. While trophies traditionally have been made with metal figures, wood columns, and wood bases, in recent years they have been made with plastic figures and marble bases. This is to retain the weight traditionally associated with a quality award and make them more affordable to use as recognition items. Trophies increasingly have used resin depictions.\n\nThe Academy Awards Oscar is a trophy with a stylized human; the Hugo Award for science fiction is a space ship; and the Wimbledon awards for its singles champions are a large loving cup for men and a large silver plate for women.\n\nA loving-cup trophy is a common variety of trophy; it is a cup shape, usually on a pedestal, with two or more handles, and is often made from silver or silver plate.\n\nHunting trophies are reminders of successes from hunting animals, such as an animal's head mounted to be hung on a wall.\n\nPerpetual trophies are held by the winner until the next event, when the winner must compete again in order to keep the trophy. In some competitions winners in a certain number of consecutive or non-consecutive events receive the trophy or its copy in permanent ownership.\n\nSome sporting trophies include:\n\nSome of the world's most famous football trophies are:\n\n\nThe original Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen in Brazil in 1983 and has never been recovered. Replicas were awarded to winning nations up to the retirement of the genuine trophy. However, prior to the 1966 final, The Football Association made an (unauthorised) replica in secret in gilded bronze for use in post-match celebrations due to security concerns – the genuine trophy was made out of close to 2 kg of pure gold. This has led to several conspiracy theories regarding which trophy was stolen – the FA replica, or the real trophy. FIFA purchased the replica for £254,500 (ten times the reserve price) in 1997, with the inflated price attributed to such rumours. This trophy is held on behalf of FIFA by the National Football Museum in Preston. The current FIFA World Cup trophy inscribe the names of the teams that won the award at the underneath the base of the trophy.\n\nA club that manages to win the Copa Libertadores trophy three consecutive times retain the trophy permanently. The current trophy has been used since 1975. Like the FIFA World Cup trophy, the winners of each edition of the tournament has their name inscribed on the trophy; unlike the FIFA World Cup trophy, a pedestal contains a list of winners in the form of badges. The current pedestal is the fourth in the trophy's history, having been used since 2009. The original trophy was awarded to Estudiantes de La Plata in 1970 (after their third win) - the present trophy is the third, identical edition.\n\nUntil 2009, clubs that win the European Champion Clubs' Cup three times in successive seasons, or five times in total, were permitted to retain the trophy in perpetuity. The present trophy has been used since 2005–06 after Liverpool's fifth win in 2005. The original trophy was awarded to Real Madrid in 1966 (after their sixth win) — the present trophy is the sixth incarnation overall.\n\nFour trophies have served as an award (out of five made) for the winner of the FA Cup. The first (1871–1895) was stolen in Birmingham and melted down, the second (1896–1910) was presented to Lord Kinnaird and is held by David Gold, the chairman of Birmingham City after private auction in 2005. The third (1910–1992) was retired after the 1992 final due to fragility and is held by The Football Association; two exact replicas of it were made, one of which has been awarded to the winners (1993–2013), the other remains as a backup in case of damage to the primary trophy. The same design was recast and was unveiled in 2014 to be more durable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany combat sports, such as boxing, mixed martial arts, and professional wrestling use championship belts as trophies; however, unlike most of the trophies mentioned above, a new one is not created every time a new champion is crowned; rather, the new champion takes the belt from the old one.\n\nThe United States military also issues a type of trophy which are known as \"non-portable decorations\". This indicates that the trophy carries the status of a military award, but is not meant to be worn on a uniform but rather is presented for static display. Such military trophies include athletic excellence awards, unit excellence awards, and superior service awards presented annually to the top service member of a command.\n\nMany professional associations award trophies in recognition of outstanding work in their respective fields. Some examples of such awards include:\n\n\nIn hunting, although competition trophies like those mentioned above can be awarded, the word \"trophy\" more typically refers to an item made from the body of a killed animal and kept as a keepsake. See taxidermy.\n\n\n"}
