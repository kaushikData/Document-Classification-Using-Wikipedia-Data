It was the second major riot that the area had witnessed in the space of four years, the last in 1981. It was sparked by the shooting of Dorothy \"Cherry\" Groce by the Metropolitan Police, while they sought her 21-year-old son Michael Groce in relation to a suspected firearms offence; they believed Michael Groce was hiding in his mother's home.\n\nAfter two days of riots, photo-journalist David Hodge had died, 43 civilians and 10 police officers were hurt. Amongst a number of fires, one building had been destroyed, 55 cars had been burnt out, and 58 burglaries had been committed including acts of looting.\n\nIn March 2014, the police eventually apologised for the wrongful shooting of Mrs Groce. In July of the same year, an inquest jury concluded that eight separate police failures had contributed to Mrs Groce's death, for which the present Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe subsequently \"apologised unreservedly for our failings\" to the family.\n\nThe community of Lambeth, after the 1981 Brixton riot, had lost trust in the Metropolitan Police, with many of the mixed race but mainly Afro-Caribbean population believing the police to be institutionally racist.\n\nTwenty-one-year-old Michael Groce was one of six children born to Dorothy \"Cherry\" Groce, who had migrated to the area from Jamaica when she was in her early teens. From aged six much of his life was spent in residential care, brought up in Tinworth House, on a rough housing estate in Vauxhall. Michael was involved with street gangs, and had been exposed to guns during his childhood. He spent time in and out of prison throughout his life, and by 1985 had accrued 50 convictions and 15 different spells in prison.\n\nAfter being released from prison two months before, whilst out on license Michael became concerned with a turf-war between local street gangs. Subsequently, given a gun for protection by a friend, a few days before the riots Michael was in an argument with his girlfriend at his mother's house, and in a fit of showing-off fired the gun into a wardrobe. Shortly afterwards, he heard a knock on the door and went down to answer it, finding a police officer enquiring if he was Michael Groce. He attempted to close the door, but after the police officer would not let him, Michael put the gun into the officer's mouth. After the officer left, Michael cleaned the gun and placed it in the house, then fled to his sister's home.\n\nOn the morning of 28 September 1985, a group of police officers raided Cherry Groce's house on Normandy Road, Brixton, including an armed CID officer, searching for suspected armed robber Michael Groce. Mrs Groce was in bed, whilst three of her six children were in residence when the police entered the house with force. During the raid, Mrs Groce was shot in the chest; after an extensive search, the police did not find Michael Groce. An ambulance was called, and by the time it had arrived a small crowd had gathered outside the house. Mrs Groce was taken to St Thomas' Hospital in central London.\n\nAs word of the shooting spread throughout the community, rumours persisted that Mrs. Groce had in fact been killed in the raid. The group that had gathered outside her house grew to over 60, and then moved to the local district police station, where they began chanting \"murderers\" and anti-police slogans, demanding disciplinary action against the officers involved.\n\nHowever, hostility between the largely black crowd and the largely white police force quickly escalated into a series of mild street battles. These then developed into elongated skirmishes in the areas of Brixton Road and Acre Lane, where the first two of a total of 55 cars over the following 48 hours were burnt out. In response the police deployed the first 50 officers in riot gear in the afternoon, who approached rioters by banging their truncheons on their riot shields. Through force which involved a number of reported unprovoked attacks on local passers-by and accredited members of the media, the police cordoned off the area around the police station on Brixton Road, and then cleared the surrounding shopping district.\n\nThat evening, the police lost control of the area for approximately 48 hours. In the subsequent riot, severe injuries were sustained by both sides, with police injured as they were attacked by young black and white youths equipped with bricks and wooden stakes. After further skirmishes, the rioters built a defensive wall out of upturned cars across the Brixton Road, which were set alight at various times. From behind this wall, the rioters threw petrol bombs at the police, and looted local shops. Police later stated that they made 149 arrests that evening, mostly for violence, 20 for burglary and theft and two for petrol bombing.\n\nIn the aftermath, photo-journalist David Hodge died a few days later as a result of an aneurysm, after being attacked by gang of looters he was trying to photograph. In total over 50 people were injured, 200 arrests were made, one building and dozens of cars were destroyed, and several shops had been looted.\n\nIn a press conference on 30 September, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Wells described the shooting of Mrs Groce as tragic, and whilst recognising the resultant \"genuine feelings, particularly those of the relatives and friends of Mrs Groce\", blamed the riots on \"an unruly criminal element.\"\n\nOn 30 September in Peckham, south London, gangs of black youths began throwing petrol bombs and setting shops alight. A major fire at a carpet warehouse off Peckham High Street was reported.\n\nOn 1 October 1985, 10 people (including three police officers) were injured in a second riot in Toxteth on 1 October 1985, after gangs stormed the district's streets and stoned and burnt cars in response to the arrest of four local black men in connection with a stabbing. Merseyside Police Operational Support Division was deployed into the area to restore order and were later criticised by community leaders and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, [Derek Warlock], for their \"over zealous and provocative tactics\", which included the drumming of batons on riot shields.\n\nOne week later, another serious conflict, sparked by similar circumstances, broke out between the Metropolitan Police and mainly black residents of North London's Tottenham district in what became known as the Broadwater Farm riot.\n\nOn her arrival at hospital, surgeons found that the bullet had penetrated Mrs Groce's lung and exited through her spine, paralysing her from the waist downwards. She was hospitalised for over a year, and in hospital-based rehabilitation for a further year; friends within the local community looked after her children. With Mrs Groce permanently paralysed and only able to get around in a wheelchair, and after further rehabilitation, she and her family were allocated a new bungalow in which to live.\n\nThe police officer who shot Mrs Groce, Detective Inspector Douglas Lovelock, was prosecuted but eventually acquitted of malicious wounding. Mrs Groce later received over Â£500,000 in compensation from the Metropolitan Police, but with no admission of liability.\n\nIn 2011, Mrs Groce contracted an infection which led to kidney failure. She was treated at King's College Hospital, but she died on Easter Sunday, and was buried in May 2011.\n\nAfter the death of Cherry Groce, the district coroner announced that a judicial inquest was to be held into her death, scheduled for June 2014. Simon Israel reporting for Channel 4 News revealed on 21 March 2014 that separate pathologists working on behalf of both the family and the police, both independently concluded that there was a causal link between the shooting and the death of Mrs Groce.\n\nWith both the Metropolitan Police and former Inspector Douglas Lovelock both to be represented at the inquest by Queen's Counsel, the Legal Aid Agency refused the Groce family funds on the grounds that \"there are no new issues.\" The family subsequently started a petition, and appealed directly to Prime Minister David Cameron for Legal Aid to support them at the inquest, supported by the Labour MP for Streatham, Chuka Umunna. The decision was subsequently overturned on 11 April 2014 by a ministerial discussion through the Ministry of Justice.\n\nOn 10 July 2014, the jury at Southwark Coroner's Court returned a verdict that concluded that eight separate police failures had contributed to Mrs Groce's death, and that her \"subsequent death was contributed to by failures in the planning and implementation of the raid\". Pathologist Dr Robert Chapman testified that during his post-mortem examination he had found metal fragments from the bullet still lodged in the base of her spine, which had contributed to her being more susceptible to debilitating illnesses. The present Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe subsequently \"apologised unreservedly for our failings\" to the family for the years of suffering, stating that the Metropolitan Police operation had been inadequate, failed to carry out its responsibilities properly, and that it was \"inexcusable\" that it had taken so long for the police to acknowledge these failings.\n\nAfter three days of hiding, Michael learnt via the television news about the shooting of his mother and the riots. He quietly turned himself in to the police the following day, accompanied by solicitor Paul Boateng. Michael was then interviewed at Scotland Yard in relation to an armed robbery at a jeweller's shop in Royston, Hertfordshire on 10 September, and later released on police bail. On 26 September, he was charged at Waterloo police station with illegal possession of a sawn-off shotgun, for which he subsequently received a three-year suspended sentence. He was never charged with any offence associated with the armed robbery or the riots.\n\nMichael wrote his mother an apology in the form of a poem, subsequently published in \"The Voice\" newspaper. Michael attempted to help the community recover; he ran a youth football team, trying to provide a fun alternative to crime.\n\nToday a reformed character, Michael is a published poet who runs poetry, personal development and motivational workshops in schools under the project title \"Cherry Blossoms\", and gives talks to dissuade others from making mistakes similar to those that he made.\n\nFollowing the trial of Inspector Lovelock, a review of fire arms procedures within the Metropolitan Police led to new policy which authorised only centrally-controlled specifically-trained specialist squads to be armed. This included parts of Special Branch, but excluded others including CID officers.\n\nIn March 2014, almost 29 years after the events and almost three years after her death, the Metropolitan Police publicly apologised to Cherry Groce's family for her wrongful shooting.\n\n\n\n"}

He lists several alternative theories on where the possible mythical Atlantis may have been situated, and cites different legends and stories that may support the different theories. All areas and theories are covered starting with Plato, Crete (Thera), the Azores and Edgar Cayce's involvement in the story. \n\nBerlitz, author of many popular books on the paranormal and unexplained phenomena, researched Atlantis and wrote a 1969 book titled \"The Mystery of Atlantis\". Berlitz not only became convinced that Atlantis was real but also that it was the source of the Bermuda Triangle mystery, a subject he explored in his 1974 best-seller \"The Bermuda Triangle.\" Illustrated in the book he strongly believed extra-terrestrials were in some way involved in Atlantis and the Bermuda Triangle. His ideas have been described as pseudoscientific. Berlitz's wild ideas about the Bermuda Triangle â and, by extension, Atlantis â were definitively debunked the following year by researcher Larry Kusche, author of 1975 \"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery â Solved.\" \n\nIn 1984, Berlitz wrote \"Atlantis: The Lost Continent Revealed\" to counter his shot down ideas from critics.\n\nAccording to skeptical researcher Guy P. Harrison who has criticized Berlitz's statements about Atlantis as nonsensical: \"Charles Berlitz, the same writer who stirred up belief in the Bermuda Triangle, also wrote \"Atlantis: The Lost Continent Revealed\". Berlitz goes so far as to promote the belief that the people of Atlantis possessed nuclear weapons many thousands of years ago and it was a large scale nuclear war that destroyed their culture!\"\n\n\"Berlitz believed that the Azores held the key to the Atlantis puzzle and wrote âVolcanic activity is constantly occurring in the Azores area, where there are still active volcanoesâ¦ The islands of Corvo and Flores in the Azores, which have been mapped since 1351, have constantly changed their shape, with large parts of Corvo having disappeared into the sea.â\n\nIn his last theory, Berlitz claimed the scenario presented by Plato was essentially correct. Although most of his evidence was thought provoking, his evidence was slim to non-existent. Here a diver had supposedly located a massive submerged pyramid near the Bahamas, but would not reveal the coordinates. \"An island supposedly emerged from the Atlantic Ocean in 1882, complete with bronze artefacts, but was never found again, and the log of the ship which discovered it was destroyed in the London blitz in 1940\". He was presumably referring to the Cuicuilco pyramid, discovered by Byron Cummings of the University of Arizona in 1922. \n\nResearcher Larry Kusche, who published \"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved in 1975\", argued that Berlitz and other authors had exaggerated their claims and hadnât done any proper research. They presented some disappearance cases as \"mysteries\" when they werenât mysteries at all, and some reported cases hadnât even happened within the Bermuda Triangle.\n\nAfter extensively researching the issue, Kusche concluded that the number of disappearances that occurred within the Bermuda Triangle wasnât actually greater than in any other similarly trafficked area of the ocean, and that other writers presented misinformationâsuch as not reporting storms that occurred on the same day as disappearances, and sometimes even making it seem as though the conditions had been calm for the purposes of creating a sensational story. In short: previous Bermuda Triangle authors didnât do their research and either knowingly or unintentionally \"made it up.\"\n\nThe book did such a thorough job of debunking the myth that it effectively ended most of the Bermuda Triangle hype. When authors like Berlitz and others were unable to refute Kuscheâs findings, even the most steadfast of believers had difficulty remaining confident in the sensationalized Bermuda Triangle narrative. Nevertheless, many magazine articles, TV shows, and movies have continued to feature the Bermuda Triangle.\n"}

Liverpool has the United Kingdom's oldest and longest established black community, going back several generations. Liverpool's black community is also unusual among those in the United Kingdom, as the Liverpool-born Black British community often constitute a category distinct from later African and Afro-Caribbean migrants.\n\nDating to the 1730s, the Black community of Liverpool is Britain's oldest, with some Liverpudlians being able to trace their black heritage for as many as ten generations. The community dates back to the American Revolutionary War with Black Loyalists settling in the city. They were later followed by more African-American soldiers. The original African-American community was followed in the 19th and 20th centuries by sailors and soldiers from all over the West Indies and West Africa. The black community experienced continued growth due to the location of Liverpool as a port city. Liverpool's port attracted many servicemen and seafarers, including African Americans, Jamaicans, Trinidadians, Belizeans, Guyanese, Nigerians, Ghanaians, Gambians, and others from all over the Caribbean and Africa. Mostly settling in the Toxteth district, they joined already settled English, Irish, Welsh, Chinese and to a lesser extent Indians of seafarer or serviceman heritage. The Liverpudlian Black community became a Mixed-race community early on, with intermarriages taking place on a large scale among people with African roots, Whites and Asians. In turn most of today's Liverpudlian Blacks, even adding more recent Afro-Caribbean and African migrants, are product of a community that became a distinct multiracial community centuries ago. This process made the Liverpudlian Black community possibly the most distinct Black British community in the United Kingdom, creating a community that is native as well as unique to the country.In 2009 the black community was estimated to make up 1.9% of Liverpool's population. By 2011 the population of Liverpool was 2.8% black according to the 2011 census.\n\nThe Liverpool Black community experienced unrest early on, with race riots going back to 1919 when returned soldiers descended on the predominantly black/mixed-race areas of Toxteth.\n\nInfamous were the 1981 Toxteth riots, which was the direct result of long-standing tensions between the local police and the black community and that saw hundreds of police and public injured, one man dead, 500 arrested, 70 buildings destroyed and damage estimated at Â£11m.\n\n\n"}

In the same year he was one of the accusers of the consul of the year 10 AD, Caius Junius Silanus. He seems to have regarded the declaimer Junius Otho â who also was an accuser of Junius Silanus â as an example in the field of rhetoric.\n\nThe historian Tacitus recognizes the talent of Bruttedius Niger but thinks that he went astray because of his ambition. According to Juvenal Bruttedius Niger first was a friend of Sejanus, but after the downfall and death of the powerful commander of the Praetorian Guard (31 AD) he kicked Sejanusâs body.\n\nSeneca the Elder has preserved two passages of Bruttedius Nigerâs historical work which deal with the assassination of Cicero (43 BC).

A more modern version of the garment has no buttons and hangs open by design. By contrast, a pullover (or sweater) does not open in front but must be \"pulled over\" the head to be worn. It may be machine- or hand-knitted. Traditionally, cardigans were made of wool but can now be made of cotton, synthetic fibers, or any combination thereof.\n\nThe cardigan was named after James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan, a British Army Major General who led the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War. It is modelled after the knitted wool waistcoat that British officers supposedly wore during the war. The legend of the event and the fame that Lord Cardigan achieved after the war led to the rise of the garment's popularity â supposedly, Brudenell invented the cardigan after noticing that the tails of his coat had accidentally been burnt off in a fireplace. The name \"Cardigan\" is an anglicised variation of the Welsh placename Ceredigion.\n\nThe term originally referred only to a knitted sleeveless vest, but expanded to other types of garment over time. Coco Chanel is credited with popularizing cardigans for women because \"she hated how tight-necked men's sweaters messed up her hair when she pulled them over her head.\" The garment is mostly associated with the college culture of the Roaring Twenties and early 1930s, being also popular throughout the 1950s, the 1970s and the 1990s. Cardigans have also regained popularity during the 2010s.\n\nPlain cardigans are often worn over shirts and inside suit jackets as a less formal version of the waistcoat or vest that restrains the necktie when the jacket has been removed. Its versatility means it can be worn in casual or formal settings and in any season, but it is most popular during cool weather.\n\nMonochromatic cardigans, in sleeved or vest form, may be viewed as a conservative fashion staple. As an item of formal clothing for any gender, it is worn over a button-down dress shirt. A less formal style is wearing a T-shirt underneath.\n\n\n\n"}

He was an ordained minister, theologian and political polemicist, and was the founder in 1788 of the Royal Literary Fund.\n\nWilliams was born in a house called Waunwaelod in Eglwysilan near Caerphilly. His early education was partly under John Smith, vicar of Eglwysilan, and he went on to a local school run by his namesake, David Williams. His father, William David, was converted to Methodism by Howell Harris; it was at his request that David Williams entered the ministry. Rev. David, an unfortunate speculator in mines and miners' tools, died in 1752; the family consisted of one surviving son and two daughters.\n\nHis father on his deathbed made David promise to enter Carmarthen Academy to qualify as a dissenting minister. He studied there, with an exhibition from the London presbyterian board (1753 to Christmas 1757), under Evan Davies, a pupil of John Eames. The academy, hitherto Calvinist, had begun to acquire a heterodox repute. From February 1755 the London congregational board sent no students, owing to the alleged Arianism of Davies's assistant, Samuel Thomas. Davies himself resigned his chair in 1759 under suspicion of Arminianism. Williams' views were unconventional, largely thanks to his four years study at Carmarthen Academy, and he was regarded as a Deist.\n\nWilliams was ordained in 1758 to the charge of the dissenting congregation at Frome, Somerset, on a stipend of Â£45. This was the congregation from which Thomas Morgan, the deist, had been dismissed in 1720. Williams's theological views did not prove satisfactory. In 1761 he moved to the Mint meeting, Exeter, founded by James Peirce. Here he was reordained. He prepared \"A Liturgy on the Principles of the Christian Religion\", which is said to have been adopted by his congregation. He soon quarrelled with 'elder members' who objected to his opinions. He retorted by finding fault with their morals. By way of an 'accommodation' he left Exeter about 1769 to take charge of a waning congregation in Southwood Lane, Highgate. To this congregation the father of John Wilkes used to drive in a coach-and-six. In this charge he appears to have remained till 1773. His withdrawal was ascribed by himself to 'the intrigues of a lady', and to no rejection of revelation, 'which he had taken for granted'. His successor, in 1774, was Joseph Towers. His first publication, \"The Philosopher, in Three Conversations\", 1771, (dedicated to Lord Mansfield and Bishop Warburton), containing a project of church reform, drew the attention of John Jebb. With the co-operation of John Lee, a proposal was set on foot for opening a chapel in London with an expurgated prayer-book. Williams was to draw attention to the plan through the public papers. His communications to the \"Public Advertiser\" republished as \"Essays on Public Worship, Patriotism, and Projects of Reformation\", 1773, were so deistic in tone as to put an end to the scheme.\n\nA taste for the drama led to his acquaintance with David Garrick whom he met at the house of a hostess of 'the wits of the time.' With this lady he visited Henry Mossop, the actor, who attributed his misfortunes to Garrick's neglect. Williams wrote to the papers embodying Mossop's view, but the communication was not printed. Three \nmonths later he published his keen but truculent \"Letter to David Garrick\", 1772. According to a note by John Philip Kemble in the British Museum copy there was a second edition; Williams, in an advertisement at the end of his \"Lectures\", 1779, vol. i., claims the authorship of the \"Letter\", and affirms that there was 'a surreptitious edition'. Morris, who reprints the \"Letter\" with a wrong date (1770), says it was withdrawn from sale. In the \"Private Correspondence of David Garrick\", 1831, is a letter (2 October 1772), signed \"D. Ws\" hinting that the published 'Letter' was by 'a young man who is making himself known us a first-rate genius... His name is Williams. He is intimate at Captain Pye's. Goldsmith knows him, and I have seen him go into Johnson's'. James Boaden, the editor of the 'Correspondence' calls the writer (evidently Williams himself) an 'arrogant boy '. On Mossop's death (18 November 1773) Williams wrote to Garrick, and received a touching reply.\n\nIn 1773 Williams took a house in Lawrence Street, Chelsea, married a wife without a fortune, and set up a school. As the fruit of his ministry he published a volume of \"Sermons, chiefly upon Religious Hypocrisy\" (1774). His educational ideas, founded on those of John Amos Comenius, he embodied in his \"Treatise on Education\"(1774). Book-learning he subordinated to scientific training based on a first-hand knowledge of facts. He made a novel application of the drunken helot plan, obtaining from a workhouse a 'lying boy' as an object lesson. His school 'prospered beyond his expectations', but the death of his wife (in 1775?) for a time unmanned him. He tore himself away, 'leaving his scholars to shift for themselves', and 'secluded himself in a distant country' for 'many months'. He went to Buxton, according to some accounts; he never returned to Chelsea.\n\nIn 1774 Benjamin Franklin 'took refuge from a political storm' in Williams's house, and became interested in his method of teaching arithmetic. Franklin joined a small club formed at Chelsea by Williams, the manufacturer Thomas Bentley (partner of Josiah Wedgwood), and James \"Athenian\" Stuart. At this club Williams broached the scheme of a society for relieving distressed authors, which Franklin did not encourage him to pursue. It was noted at the club that most of the members, though 'good men', yet 'never went to church'. Franklin regretted the want of 'a rational form of devotion'. To supply this, Williams, with aid from Franklin, drew up a form. It was printed six times before it satisfied its projectors, and was eventually published as \"A Liturgy on the Universal Principles of Religion and Morality\", 1776. It does not contain his reduction of the creed to one article, 'I believe in God. Amen'.\n\nOn 7 April 1776, Williams opened for morning service a vacant chapel near Cavendish Square (the building was replaced in 1858 by All Saints, Margaret Street), using his liturgy, and reading lectures, with texts usually from the Bible, sometimes from classic authors. He got 'about a score of auditors', who seem to have been persons of distinction. The opening lecture was published. Copies of the liturgy were sent to Frederick the Great and to Voltaire, who returned appreciative letters in bad French and good English respectively. International botanical travellers Sir Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander 'now and then peeped into the chapel, and got away as fast as they decently could'. Williams's \"Letter to the Body of Protestant Dissenters\", 1777, is a plea for such breadth of toleration as would legally cover such services as his. All the expenses fell on Williams, who was saved from ruin only by the subscription to his \"Lectures on the Universal Principles and Duties of Religion and Morality\" 1779. These lectures (critical rather than constructive, and not eloquent, though well written) were read at the chapel in 1776â1777. The experiment is said to have lasted four years, but it is probable that after the second year the services were not held in Margaret Street; they were transferred, on the advice of Robert Melville, to a room in the British Coffee House, Cockspur Street, Melville giving a dinner in Brewer Street after service, 'with excellent Madeira'. The statement by Thomas Somerville that Melville took him, in the period 1779â1785, to the service in 'Portland' Square is no doubt due to a slip of memory. Somerville's further statement that the 'dispersion of his flock' was due to Williams's 'immorality' becoming 'notorious' seems a groundless slander. No hint of it is conveyed in the satiric lampoon \"Orpheus, Priest of Nature\" 1781, which affirms, on the contrary, that Williams's principles were too strict for his hearers. The appellation 'Priest of Nature' is said to have been first given him by Franklin; 'Orpheus' ascribes it to 'a Socratic woollen-draper of Covent Garden'. Gregoire affirms that he had it from Williams that a number of his followers passed from deism to atheism.\n\nWilliams now supported himself by taking private pupils. After the speech of Sir George Savile on 17 March 1779 in favour of an amendment of the Toleration Act, Williams published a letter on \"The Nature and Extent of Intellectual Liberty\", 1779, claiming that religious toleration should be without restriction. It was answered by Manasseh Dawes. In the same year, and with the same object, he translated and published Voltaire's \"Treatise on Toleration\", \"Ignorant Philosopher\" and \"Commentary on Beccaria\". In 1780 he issued \"A Plan of Association on Constitutional Principles\"; and on the formation of county associations for parliamentary reform he published his \"Letters on Political Liberty\" (1782). This was translated into French the following year by Jacques Pierre Brissot, then in London conducting the Lyceum. Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la PlatiÃ¨re, a friend of Brissot, visited London in 1784, when Williams made his acquaintance.\n\nWilliams's publications at this period include \"Letters concerning Education\" 1785; \"Royal Recollections on a Tour to Cheltenham\" (anon.), 1788; \"Lectures on Political Principles\" 1789; \"Lectures on Education\", 1789; \"Lessons to a Young Prince\" (anon.), 1790.\n\nThe idea of a \"literary fund\" to aid \"distressed talents\" was again suggested by Williams in a club of six persons, formed on the discontinuance of his Sunday lectures (1780), and meeting at the Prince of Wales's coffee-house, Conduit Street. Among its original members, besides Williams, were Captain Thomas Morris, John Gardner (vicar of Battersea), and perhaps the printer John Nichols. Fruitless applications were made after 1783 to William Pitt the Younger (who thought the matter very important), Charles James Fox, Edmund Burke, and Sir Joseph Banks. An advertisement was published (October 1786), 'with no material effect'. The death in a debtors' prison (1 April 1787) of Floyer Sydenham led Williams to press the matter. The club, not being unanimous, was dissolved, and another (of eight members) formed. At its first meeting (spring of 1788) the constitution of the Literary Fund, drawn up by Williams, was adopted, each member subscribing a guinea. An advertisement (10 May 1788) invited further subscriptions. The first general meeting to elect officers was held on Tuesday 18 May 1790 at the Prince of Wales's coffee-house. In the course of twelve years Â£1,738 was distributed among 105 persons. The society was incorporated 19 May 1818; in 1842 it became the Royal Literary Fund. By the close of the century it possessed an income exceeding Â£4,000, half from investments, and half from annual contributions.\n\nAt the instance of Dr. Hooper of Pant-y-Goetre and Morgan of Tredegar, Williams undertook to write a history of Monmouthshire, and in 1792 visited the county to collect materials. Shortly afterwards Roland, during his second term of office as minister of the interior, invited Williams to Paris. He went over about August 1792, was made a French citizen, and remained till the execution (21 January 1793) of Louis XVI, a measure which he strongly deprecated. While in Paris he published \"Observations sur la derniere Constitution de la France\", 1793. He brought with him, on his return, a letter to William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, from Lebrun, minister of war, who wished to make Williams a medium of communication between the two governments; but no notice was taken of it. An engagement previously entered into for completing the continuation of Hume's \"History of England\" was cancelled, owing to the political odium incurred by his visit to France. His \"History of Monmouthshire\", 1796, with illustrations drawn and partly engraved by his friend Gardner, and a very modest introduction, was considered a standard work on the subject; unfortunately it has no index.\n\nAfter the peace of Amiens (1802) he again visited France. It was surmised that he had been entrusted with some confidential mission by the English government. Before leaving he had published \"Claims of Literature\", 1802, an authorised account of the Literary Fund. On his return he issued one or two anonymous political tracts, showing, it is said, a diminished confidence in revolutionary methods. His authorship of some anonymous publications is doubtful. On internal evidence he is credited with \"Egeria\", 1803, intended as a first volume of a periodical devoted to political economy. His pecuniary resources failed him.\n\nHe had suffered from paralytic attacks, and had a severe stroke in 1811, from which time his faculties declined. He was invited to take up his abode in the house of the Literary Fund, 36 Gerrard Street, Soho, and there he remained till his death, regularly attending the society's meetings. At a special meeting of the general committee, held without Williams's knowledge on 25 July 1815, it was resolved to offer him Â£50 every six months, as evidence of the committee's 'attachment to the first principles of their society'. Only one instalment was paid before his death on 29 June 1816. A second instalment was handed to his niece and housekeeper, Mary Watkins. On 6 July he was buried in St Anne's Church, Soho, where there is a brief inscription to his memory.\n\nHis will, dated 16 July 1814, left his papers to his executors, Richard Yates and Thomas Wittingham; his other property went to his niece and housekeeper, Mary Watkins (died 5 February 1845), who moved from Gerrard Street to Lower Sloane Street, and afterwards to King's Road, Chelsea.\n\n\n\n"}

She is also a member of the interim consultative committee of the International Organization for a Participatory Society which she describes as offering \"an opportunity to reach across borders, time zones, organizations, communities, and individual interests and grow solidarity\".\n\nA high school drop-out who was able to go to university without finishing High School, Bernard got a job as a service worker at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. She began taking classes from 1971 to 1973. In 1976, she graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Alberta in Edmonton.\n\nShe obtained a master's degree in history from the University of British Columbia in 1979, and a Ph.D. from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver in 1988.\n\nWhile working on her doctorate, Bernard worked as a labor historian for the Telecommunications Workers Union in 1980. She left this position in 1982. From 1984 to 1986, Bernard was a labor historian for the Brewery, Winery and Distillery Workers Union (now part of the British Columbia Government and Service Employees' Union).\n\nDuring her studies at Simon Fraser, Bernard became director of the Labour Program in the university's Continuing Studies division. She continued in this role from 1983 to 1989.\n\nIn the fall of 1989, Bernard became executive director of the Harvard Trade Union Program (now part of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School).\n\nBernard's research interests are widespread and varied. Her writings often focus on women and the traditionally female jobs, to which she brings a feminist and highly class-conscious theoretical perspective. She continues to focus on workers in the telecommunications industry, and the role technological change plays in altering work. In the last several years, she has publicly discussed how advancing technology will change how labor unions function (especially in regard to member-to-member and union-member communication and organizing).\n\nBernard's primary reputation, however, is as public speaker. She is provocative and blunt, and has been known to pleasantly shock audiences with her off-color language. Bernard often takes the American labor movement to task for not being aggressive enough in pushing its agenda, too willing to couch its opinions and conclusions in objective language, and for not engaging in strategic thinking. As Bernard herself has stated, her prescription is for the American labor movement \"to be bold, to be explicit, be as loyal to labor as the\nbusiness school is to business. Be audacious!\" Such statements, as well as her skills as an orator, have made her much sought-after as a panelist and public speaker.\n\nBernard is a member of the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women (CRIAW), the Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology (SCWIST), the Labor and Employment Relations Association, and the United Association for Labor Education.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1995, she was a trustee of the George Meany Center for Labor Studies.\n\nShe is a member of the editorial boards of \"WorkingUSA\" and \"New Labor Forum\" and is a sponsor of \"New Politics\".\n\nShe is a member of the National Writers Union, Local 1981, United Auto Workers, AFL-CIO.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In other cases, the family register serves as a centralized repository for family legal events, such as births, deaths, marriages, and expatriations, as with the \"familienbuch\" in use in Germany and the \"\" in France, although it is not the sole source of official recognition for such events.\n\nUse of government-sanctioned or administered family registers, while common in many European nations and in countries which use continental-style civil law (where the family or household is legally viewed as the fundamental unit of a nation), is nonetheless rare in English-speaking countries (for example, the closest equivalent in the United Kingdom is the electoral roll, which is also organised by household, but it is limited in the amount of information recorded).\n\nAlthough the United States for example assigns most citizens and residents a social security number intended to be unique to the recipient and information regarding birth, death and work history (in the form of contributions to the social security system) is collected, the U.S. social security system has long been intentionally restricted in the scope of information collected and maintained regarding individuals where not directly related to social security benefitsâas such, no information is centrally collected regarding marriage, citizenship status, parentage, or the like, in contrast to the German and Japanese family register systems.\n\nEstablishment of a more comprehensive personal information repository (along the lines of the Japanese or former German systems) has been criticized by civil liberties advocates as subject to governmental or criminal abuse, while proponents cite the benefits of simplified access to vital information.\n\nIn South Korea, use of the \"hojeok\" (similar to the Japanese household registry, written using identical Chinese characters) was repealed in 2005, in favor of a personal registry system.\n\nThe systems of household registers in China, Korea and Japan date back to the Tang Dynasty or Heian Period or earlier, both since the seventh century.\n\n\nThe \"há» kháº©u\" is nominally a household and residence registration systemâ\"há»\" is the Sino-Vietnamese word for \"household,\" and \"kháº©u\", literally \"mouth\" in Sino-Vietnamese, means \"household member.\" The local authority issues to each household a \"household registration book\" or \"sá» há» kháº©u\", in which the basic biographical information of each household member is recorded. The \"sá» há» kháº©u\" is the ultimate legal proof of residence in Vietnam. Together with the \"citizen identification card\" or \"giáº¥y chá»©ng minh nhÃ¢n dÃ¢n/cÄn cÆ°á»c cÃ´ng dÃ¢n\", the \"sá» há» kháº©u\" constitutes the most important legal identification document in Vietnam.\n\nModeled after the Chinese \"hukou\" system and originally used in urban areas only, \"há» kháº©u\" functioned as a way to manage urban growth and limit how many people moved, as well as who moved, in and out of the city. Gradually the system became a universal method of control as its application expanded to the countryside. It helped the government keep track of not just movement but also births and deaths. And at certain point during the latter half of the twentieth century, a tight local surveillance system existed to ensure that people were sleeping at the address they had registered as their own. The joke was that the unintended effect of the whole system was the prevention of extramarital affairs.\n\nEven after substantial reforms in the 1990s, the \"há» kháº©u\" system is complicated and cumbersome. It defines four types of residence, KT1 through KT4. KT1 is the primary and permanent type of residence, and denotes a person's primary residential address. If this person moves on a semi-permanent basis to another place within the same province or national municipality (within Saigon, for example), then he or she needs to register for a KT2 residential status at that new address. If this same move happens across provincial borders, then the person has to sign up for a KT3 registration. For migrant workers and students temporarily residing outside of their province or national municipality of permanent residence, they need to apply for a KT4 registration. Navigating this matrix of regulations is tough. But the public security apparatus that manages the \"há» kháº©u\" system is also difficult to deal with, especially if one is a poor migrant worker with little to no formal education. Yet \"há» kháº©u\" remains absolutely crucial, especially for the poor. It is tied to access to welfare benefits, and, in the case of children, the right to attend public school. For a migrant family in Saigon with no KT3 or KT4 registration, subsidised medical care, poverty assistance, and almost-free schooling are all out of reach.\n\nThe government of Vietnam has decided to stop controlling citizens with permanent residence book and using an online database whereby each citizen will be registered with a personal identification code. The resolution issued earlier this week says that Vietnam will stop managing its citizen registration through the residency book, which attaches a person to a permanent address .\n\n\n\"Kartu Keluarga\" (literally, Family Card) is a document in Indonesia that proves residency and which records relationships and family members. Every family in Indonesia is required to own one of these documents. This document records the identity of the family's head and the individual members. The document is kept by the family's head, 'ketua RT' (head of neighborhood association) and 'desa' or 'kelurahan' office. The document is a provincial government document, thus, it is not permitted to strike out, change, replace or make additions in the document. Every data change has to be reported to the village or 'kelurahan' office which will replace the old one with the updated one. Newcomers are not recorded in the document until they have been reported or have been deemed not to have a local residency status.\n\nChanges in data have to be reported within 14 (fourteen) working days by the family's head to 'desa' or 'kelurahan' office. Each report of changes must be submitted with the copy that is held by the family's head and 'ketua RT'. Changes in data include: birth, death or migration (of a member).\n\nHowever, if a family moves to different 'desa' or 'kelurahan', the document must be revoked by 'desa' or 'kelurahan' office, which must be submitted with the copy that held by family's head and 'ketua RT'. The official in the prior location will produce \"Surat Keterangan Pindah\" (Note of Migration) which will be used to make the new \"Kartu Keluarga\" in the arrival by 'desa' or 'kelurahan' office.\n\n\n"}

The foundation is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany. The \"private non-profit foundation\" was founded in 1966 out of fear that classic German cinema's original stock, and the rights to these films, would be sold off internationally. The stock was originally owned by Bertelsmann. The foundation maintains about 80% of Germany's forbidden Nazi-era films and acts as a gate keeper for public access to these films via archives and curated public screenings.\n\nAs an archive and rights holder the Murnau Foundation curates Its most important endowment is the unique, cohesive movie stock, which comprises copies and material as well as rights from the former production companies UFA, Decla, Universum-Film, Bavaria, Terra, Tobis and Berlin-Film. This outstanding inventory of cultural and film history â more than 6,000 silent movies and sound films (feature films, documentaries, short movies and commercials) â covers the period from the beginnings of motion pictures to the early 1960s, and includes movies by important directors such as Fritz Lang, Ernst Lubitsch, Detlef Sierck, Helmut KÃ¤utner, and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, the namesake of the foundation. titles include The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari from 1920, Metropolis from 1927, The Blue Angel from 1930, The Three from the Filling Station from 1930, \"MÃ¼nchhausen\" from 1943 and \"GroÃe Freiheit Nr. 7\" from 1944.\n\nThe foundation runs \"the German Film House in a central location in the state capital of Hesse â Wiesbaden\" as well as the \"Murnau cinema theatre where films are shown to the public and a multi-function area where numerous events and exhibitions are held.\"\n\nThe foundation's most prominent film restoration was the 2010 re-release of Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\" which was originally screened at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival. It has additionally restored, with financial support from the prior owners of their film stock, Bertelsmann, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari which premiered \"at the Berlinale in February 2014\" which it won an award for best archive restoration in 2015 from FOCAL International. The foundation was also involved in the restoration of Fritz Lang's \"Destiny\" which had \"faded and degraded almost beyond recognition.\" The foundation maintains about 80% of Germany's forbidden Nazi-era films referring to this collection of 40 films as \"reserved\" films which are \"propagandistic productions created under Hitler, which may only be used for scientific evaluation in Germany and within the framework of political education.\" This collection includes the notorious \"Jud SÃ¼Ã\", \"Quax the Crash Pilot\", \"Kolberg\", \"I Accuse\", and \"The Eternal Jew\".\n\nThe treatment of reserved films by the Murnau Foundation has been met with criticism. Critics accuse the foundation of misusing copyrights for film censorship and not for the intended purpose of copyright law where, they argue, the government should institute a ban through legislation instead. Unlike the FSK, there are no legal evaluations for the decisions of the Board of Trustees. Critics also point out the opaque process of deciding which films should be reserved noting that there is no transparent criteria, the experts consulted are not publicized, and any reports used are not publicized. For instance, the film \"The Old and the Young King\" contains Nazi propaganda, however, was allowed to be screened publicly. Additionally, the nature of the reserved film screenings has been criticized, since the \"only\" option is to view them with accompanying expert supervision, commentary, and discussion.\n\n\n"}

The bust of Nefertiti, discovered in the sands of the studio of the sculptor Thutmose, and was a piece that Borchardt wanted for Germany. Recent evidence proves that Borchardt manipulated his way into keeping the bust. Borchardt first showed the Egyptian official a photograph of the bust \"that didn't show Nefertiti in her best light\". In the accompanying documents, the object was listed as a painted plaster bust of a princess. When Gustave Lefebvre came for inspection, the bust was tightly wrapped up in the bottom of a box. The document reveals that Borchardt claimed the bust was made of gypsum (a very low-grade material) to mislead the inspector. Borchardt was one of the leading Egyptologists in the world, and knew that the bust was actually made out of limestone. The bust was one of the artifacts at the top of the exchange list but was never asked for by the Egyptians in 1913. The bust of Nefertiti was granted to Germany according to the provisions of Law No. 14 of 1912, and is today a primary exhibition of the Neues Museum in Berlin.

{"id": "55994602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55994602", "title": "Historical dictionary", "text": "Historical dictionary\n\nA historical dictionary or dictionary on historical principles is a type of dictionary which deals not only with the present-day meanings of words but also the historical development of their forms and meanings. It may also describe the vocabulary of an earlier stage of a language's development without covering present-day usage at all. A historical dictionary is primarily of interest to scholars of language, but may also be used as a general dictionary or by those who are casually interested in understanding a word's development over time.\n\nTypical features of a historical dictionary are:\n\nHowever, not all dictionaries which are called 'historical' have all of these features. For example, the \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\" includes only minimal quotations, with most entries having only an approximate date of first use, and the \"Webster's New International Dictionary\" (which, though it does not market itself as historical, is founded on historical principles) features only dates of first use and does not order its senses chronologically.\n\nFor some languages, like Sanskrit and Greek, the historical dictionary (in the sense of a word-list explaining the meanings of words that were obsolete at the time of their compilation) was the first form of dictionary developed; though not being scholarly historical dictionaries in the modern sense, they did give a sense of semantic change over time. Early modern European dictionaries also often included a significant historical element, without being fully historical in form; for instance, Samuel Johnson's \"Dictionary of the English Language\" (1755) included quotations from admired writers as well as some words that were obsolete or obsolescent by the mid 18th century.\n\nModern historical principles emerged fully with the publication of John Jamieson's \"Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language\" (1808). Like modern historical dictionaries, Jamieson attempted to find the earliest use of each word, and printed quotations in chronological order demonstrating the changes which had occurred to that word throughout history.\n\nIn 1812 the German classicist Franz Passow laid out his plan for a comprehensive dictionary of the Greek language which would 'set out [â¦] the life story of each single word in a conveniently ordered overviews', which was completed as the \"HandwÃ¶rterbuch der griechischen Sprache\" in 1824. This idea was transmitted to the English-speaking world through the work of Liddell and Scott on their \"GreekâEnglish Lexicon\" (1843), based on a translation of Passow's work into English. However, it was not until the beginning of the \"Deutsches WÃ¶rterbuch\" project of the Brothers Grimm in 1838 that a historical dictionary of a modern language was attempted.\n\nThroughout the later nineteenth century numerous historical dictionary projects were started for the various languages of Europe. The main historical dictionary of English, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", was initiated in 1857 and was completed in 1928.\n\nRecently the availability of historical text corpora and other large text databases such as digital newspaper archives have begun to influence historical dictionaries. The \"TrÃ©sor de la langue franÃ§aise\" was the first historical dictionary to be based mainly on a computerized corpus. Most recent historical dictionaries and historical dictionary revision projects have been based on a mixture of quotations taken down be hand and texts from corpora.\n\nBecause of their size and scope, the compilation of historical dictionaries takes significantly longer than the compilation of general dictionaries. This is often exacerbated by the scholarly nature and limited audience for the works, meaning that the budget is often limited; historical dictionary projects often survive on a grant-to-grant basis, seeking new funding for each new section of the work. Some historical dictionaries, such as Jonathan Lighter's \"Historical Dictionary of American Slang\", have proven to be so expensive for their publishers that they have ended production before the dictionary was completed.\n\nTraditionally historical dictionaries were produced by employing a large number of readers to read and excerpt from historical texts into individual pieces of paper, which were then collated into alphabetical order and referred to during the compilation of the relevant entry. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\", for example, established a reading programme at its foundation which continues to this day. The advent of computerized full-text search databases and techniques means that lexicographers can now make use of corpora of documents to gain a more balanced view of the history of a particular word or phrase, as well as finding new quotation material to fill gaps in the history of some words; some lexicographers have noted, however, that electronic search is not a complete replacement for manual quotation-gathering, among other things because though it can help finding examples of a word already known to exist, full-text search is less good at identifying which words need to be researched in the first place.\n\n\nThe \"Woerdenboek der Nederlandsche Taal\" is the largest dictionary of the Dutch language, founded on historical principles and published from 1864 to 1998, with a supplement following in 2001.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is the largest and best-known historical dictionary of the English language, with an aim to cover all words which saw some significant use at any time between the early Middle English period and the present day.\n\nThe earlier history of English is covered in more detail by the \"Middle English Dictionary\" (1954â2001) and the \"Dictionary of Old English\" (1986âpresent). Despite efforts made at time of the founding of the \"Middle English Dictionary\" project to produce a dictionary of Early Modern English, this never came to fruition.\n\nSeveral historical dictionaries exist which cover the dialects and regionalisms particular to certain geographical areas, like the \"English Dialect Dictionary\", the \"Scottish National Dictionary\" and the \"Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue\", the \"Dictionary of American Regional English\", the \"Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles\", and the \"Australian National Dictionary\".\n\nUniquely, from the 1960s to the 2000s, a historical thesaurus was produced for English, which inverts the traditional historical dictionary by showing the development of concepts into words, rather than the development of words to describe different concepts. The \"Historical Thesaurus of English\" was published in 2009 and is largely based on data from the \"Oxford English Dictionary\"; a similar project is now underway for the Scots language.\n\nDictionnaire historique de la langue franÃ§aise\n\nThe largest historical dictionary of German is the \"Deutsches WÃ¶rterbuch\" originally compiled by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm and completed after their death in 1961. A second edition of the letters AâF is due for completion in 2017.\n\nThere is also the \"Deutsches FremdwÃ¶rterbuch\" which exclusively covers words loaned into German from other languages, which were largely (though not entirely) omitted from the Grimm dictionary.\n\nThere is also a \"FrÃ¼hneuhochdeutsches WÃ¶rterbuch\" covering Early Modern German, the \"Mittelhochdeutsches WÃ¶rterbuch\" covering Middle High German, and an \"Althochdeutsches WÃ¶rterbuch\" covering Old High German.\n\n\nThe \"Thesaurus Linguae Latinae\" underway in Munich is intended to be a complete historical dictionary of classical Latin.\n\nTheÂ International Union of Academies undertook in 1924 to compile a series of national dictionaries of Latin in each of its member academies; for instance, the British Academy produced the \"Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources\".\n\n\n\n"}

The first session to establish the society was held on 2 February 1867 which was summoned by Arnold Ipolyi. Here they discussed the ways in which the society was formed and chose a committee to elaborate the basic rules. The first General Assembly was held with 300 members at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. On 13 June Imre MikÃ³ was elected to the chairman of the society, and acted as a leader until 1876.\n\nThe goal of the new millennium was that the society renewed the old traditions of conferences and congresses related to the various significant anniversaries, and it began monthly talk series about \"Critical Issues in the national history\" and the modernization of Periodical SzÃ¡zadok. The society celebrated its 150th anniversary on May 15, 2017, and on this occasion a memorial conference was held at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences on 6 December 2017.\n\nThe management and the Board of Directors is run by the General Assembly. The 20 members of the Board of Directors are elected by the ordinary Annual General Assembly meeting among regular members by secret ballot. The management is consisting of nine members: the chairperson, the five deputy chairpersons among whom one serves as an acting chairperson, the general secretary, the chairman of the Editorial Board of Periodical SzÃ¡zadok and its editor-in-chief.\n\n\nThe society published several journals, periodicals and books from its establishment, 1867, e.g monographs, book series, sourcebooks, study books, biographies, mÃ©moires, e.g. about significant Hungarian historical persons like Ladislaus IV of Hungary, Louis I of Hungary, Mary, Queen of Hungary, Matthias Corvinus, TamÃ¡s BakÃ³cz, Sigismund RÃ¡kÃ³czi, PÃ©ter PÃ¡zmÃ¡ny, Gabriel Bethlen, MiklÃ³s ZrÃ­nyi, George II RÃ¡kÃ³czi, Emeric ThÃ¶kÃ¶ly. In 1867 it established its most important periodical named \"SzÃ¡zadok\" (Centuries) which has survived until now.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "505029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505029", "title": "Hypermodernity", "text": "Hypermodernity\n\nHypermodernity (supermodernity) is a type, mode, or stage of society that reflects an inversion of modernity in which the function of an object has its reference point in the form of an object rather than function being the reference point for form. Hypermodernism stipulates a world in which the object has been replaced by the attributes of the object. The new attribute-driven world is driven by the rise of technology and aspires to a convergence between technology and biology and more importantly information and matter. Hypermodernism finds its validation in emphasis on the value of new technology to overcome natural limitations and emphasizes a dismissal of an object-driven past in favor of a flexible, attribute-driven heuristic. \n\nHypermodernity emphasizes a hyperbolic separation between past and present due to the fact that:\n\nHypermodernity inverts Modernity to allow the attributes of an object to provide even more individuality than modernism. Modernity trapped form within the bounds of limited function; hypermodernity posits that function is now evolving so rapidly, it must take its reference point from form itself. Both positive and negative societal changes occur due to hyper-individualism and increased personal choice. \n\nPostmodernity rejected the idea of the past as a reference point and curated objects from the past for the sole purpose of freeing form from function. In postmodernism, truth was ephemeral as the focus was to avoid non-falsifiable tenets. Postmodernity described a total collapse of Modernity and its faith in progress and improvement in empowering the individual.\n\nIf distinguished from hypermodernity, supermodernity is a step beyond the ontological emptiness of postmodernism and relies upon plausible heuristic truths. Whereas modernism focused upon the creation of great truths (or what Lyotard called \"master narratives\" or \"metanarratives\"), and postmodernity was intent upon their destruction (deconstruction); supermodernity operates extraneously of meta-truth. Instead, attributes are extracted from objects of the past based on their present relevance. Since attributes are both true and false, a truth value is not necessary including falsifiability. Supermodernity curates useful attributes from modern and postmodern objects in order to escape nihilistic postmodern tautology. The touchscreen phone is an excellent example of supermodernism in action.

He obtained a BA in philosophy, with honors in mathematics.\n\nIn September 1923, Daujat entered LycÃ©e Janson-de-Sailly where he studied mathematics. Meanwhile, his former high school biology teacher Pastor Jules Lefevre directed him toward the philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas.

An American official noted at the time, \"It's a good bust.\"\n\nHowever, in a 1989 report on El Salvador, Human Rights Watch noted that the Casolo arrest came at a time when the Salvadoran police and army were arresting, jailing and expelling foreigners working with Salvadoran churches and relief organizations. These critics stated their belief that the government used the Casolo incident as part of an effort to threaten and discredit the entire foreign religious community in El Salvador. They also expressed their concern that it appeared to them that the U.S. Embassy staff in San Salvador and officials in Washington appeared to have already accepted the Salvadoran military's view that Casolo's guilt was an established fact. On November 27, 1989, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater stated that \"there are indications of her involvement, that's for certain\". Faced with criticism for what appeared to be a bias towards Casolo, Fitzwater apologized \"to anyone who feels that they were offended by this.\"\n\nDuring this time period, many American and Europeans, often under the auspices of church organizations, were believed to be assisting the FMLN in what they believed was a liberation struggle against the Government of El Salvador. In another incident during the 1989 offensive, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was contacted by the FMLN and told that another American woman could be located at a specific location who was suffering from battle injuries. The ICRC picked up the woman, whose jaw had been destroyed by a bullet, and transported her to a San Salvador hospital. The evidence suggested that she had been moving with an FMLN unit when it clashed with a Salvadoran military patrol.\n\nThe Salvadoran government of Alfredo Cristiani was pressed by both the Salvadoran military and outraged citizens, who demanded prosecution of a foreigner contributing to the violence in their country. However, Casolo was also supported by a wide number of critics of the Salvadoran government, who demanded that she be released immediately. Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark flew in to represent Casolo, as did a number of religious leaders.\n\nAfter days of pressure, President Cristiani ordered Casolo released for lack of evidence and deported on December 13, 1989. After spending the Christmas holiday with her family in the U.S. Casolo undertook a nationwide public speaking tour to declare her innocence and denounce the Government of El Salvador and the United States' involvement in that country. \n\nAfter her release, Casolo was asked to testify before a Congressional subcommittee on the conduct of U.S. Embassy officials in San Salvador during her detention. She became a peace activist and is a PhD candidate in Geography at the University of California at Berkeley.

He was the first president of the Provisional Government of the Basque Country, as well as the executive's defense advisor during the Spanish Civil War. Under his mandate, the Provisional Government formed the Basque Army and fought for the Second Spanish Republic.\n\nJosÃ© Antonio Aguirre was born in Bilbao, Spain, in the province of Biscay. He studied in the Basque Country's first Ikastola, a school where all lessons were given in the Basque language. He later studied law at the University of Deusto.\n\nAfter his father's death in 1920, Aguirre moved with his family to Algorta, close to Bilbao. At 16 years of age, he had to become a father figure to his 10 younger brothers and sisters.\n\nAfter finishing his law studies, he began working in the family business, Chocolates Aguirre. He later took responsibility for the business and introduced many reforms, including free health care and paid holidays, which significantly improved conditions for the workers in the factory. He also donated part of the business's revenue to the poor and advocated for social housing. Until 1937, Chocolates BilbaÃ­nos S.A. was the second biggest business in its sector in Spain.\n\nAguirre was a football player for Athletic Bilbao. During the Spanish Civil War, he was one of the main promoters of the Basque Country national football team, which played in Europe and the Americas to raise funds for Basque refugee children whose parents had been forced into exile.\n\nIn 1926, after completing his military service, he began work as an attorney at Esteban Bilbao's office. Soon after, he founded his own law firm, which focused on political issues and the working conditions of the lower class.\n\nAt this time, Spain was ruled by the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera. Aguirre, a Basque nationalist, joined the Basque Nationalist Party, or Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV). The party later divided into two political streams. Aguirre opposed the division, believing that the Basque Country was above any differences. He worked to unify the two parts and succeeded in 1930.\n\nAguirre increased his involvement in politics and published articles in the newspapers \"Euzko Gaztedia\" and \"Euzkadi\". As an example of his integrationist views and new ideals, in 1932, he proposed that the party should accept people who were not born in the Basque Country.\n\nAfter the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera ended in 1930, a new political era began in Spain. In 1931 and 1932, Aguirre intervened decisively in failed attempts at Basque devolution, which called for self-government, including in Navarre.\n\nOn 5 November 1933, two weeks before a general election, a referendum was held in Ãlava, Gipuzkoa, and Biscay on new wording for the Statute of Devolution, which abandoned the inclusion of Navarre. The wording was approved by an overwhelming majority (459,000 votes in favour, 14,000 against), although in Ãlava, the votes in favour did not reach 50%.\n\nAs a result of the dissolution of the legislature for the general election, the hesitation of radical government, and the Carlist party's opposition to the incorporation of Ãlava in the statutory process, the Devolution was blocked until 1 October 1936, when the Spanish Civil War was unleashed.\n\nOn 7 October, the councillors from Biscay, along with some from Gipuzkoa and Ãlava, participated in passing a ballot. A major uprising had occurred in Ãlava and Navarre, and most of Gipuzkoa was in the hands of the rebels. These rebels, as well as the political machinations of the councillors, set the stage for major political change. Aguirre was elected lehendakari, or president. After a religious ceremony at the Basilica of BegoÃ±a, in which he swore allegiance to Catholicism, his country, and his party, he visited Guernica and took his oath of office in the Basque language:\n\nA government of conciliation was formed with Nationalists, Socialists, Communists, and other Republicans, though not without tensions between them. The government was in power in Biscay for several months until the fall of Bilbao.\n\nThe first Basque government was made up of four members of the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (Aguirre as president and head of defense, JesÃºs MarÃ­a Leizaola as head of justice and culture, Eliodoro de la Torre as head of finance, and Telesforo MonzÃ³n as head of interior); three of the PSOE (Santiago Aznar as head of industry, Juan Gracia ColÃ¡s as head of welfare, and Juan de los Toyos as head of labor); one of AcciÃ³n Nacionalista Vasca (Gonzalo NÃ¡rdiz as head of agriculture); one of the Republican Left (RamÃ³n MarÃ­a Aldasoro Galarza as head of trade); one of the Republican Union (Alfredo Espinosa as head of health); and one of the Spanish Communist Party (Juan AstigarrabÃ­a as head of public works).\n\nThe Basque Army (Basque: \"Eusko Gudarostea\"), with 100,000 soldiers, was made up of battalions of different ideologies. It was well armed but poorly trained, and one of its most acute deficiencies was the absence of heavy artillery and an air force. Aguirre begged Indalecio Prieto and Manuel AzaÃ±a to send some aircraft. Historians agree that this was not a viable option because of the difficulties in breaking the siege of Biscay. Notwithstanding, 40 to 50 airplanes were sent in different shipments, the majority flying over enemy territory. Others were sent across France and, after being disarmed, were retained or returned to Barcelona or Valencia in accordance with a \"no intervention\" policy. Another factor that contributed decisively to the Basque Army's defeat was its lack of a qualified general staff.\n\nIn June 1937, the Nationalists broke through the Iron Ring of Bilbao and entered the city as a result of the treachery of Alejandro Goicoechea, the engineer who had designed the fortifications. Aguirre moved his government to TrucÃ­os before heading to Santander and finally to Catalonia, where he prepared to continue fighting with his men. Beforehand, in May, Aguirre had entered into talks with the Italians, through intermediaries, about a possible surrender. These talks continued, with the leader of the Basque Nationalist Party, Juan de Ajuriaguerra, discussing termsâthe SantoÃ±a Agreementâto allow a withdrawal from Bilbao if Nationalist troops did not attack the city. However, they did attack, and Aguirre refused to sign the surrender agreement and fought on.\n\nAguirre fled the country after the war and was pursued for years by agents of Francisco Franco. His exile took him to Paris, Berlin, and New York. In June 1940, the Breton Yann FouÃ©rÃ© gave him documents that allowed him to escape France, which had been invaded by the Nazis, allies of Franco.\n\nAguirre fled first to France, where he organized camps and services for Basque refugees and the government-in-exile. Caught behind enemy lines, he was in Belgium when Hitler occupied that country. He then fled to Berlin, where he lived underground until a false identity was arranged.\n\nUnder the protection of a Panamanian ambassador (GermÃ¡n Guardia, who provided him with a Panamanian passport), Aguirre reached Sweden. Dodging SS German intelligence, he arrived in Rio de Janeiro on the ship Vasaholm on 27 August 1941. The Brazilian customs authorities registered a Panamanian, Dr. JosÃ© Ãlvarez Lastra, and a Venezuelan, MarÃ­a de Arrigorriaga, accompanied by their children, JosÃ© and Gloria. These were actually Aguirre, his wife MarÃ­a Zabala, and their sons Aintzane and Joseba. But in spite of intense efforts made by Manuel de Ynchausti in the United States, after a month Aguirre's true identity was in danger of being discovered.\n\nHe wrote then to RamÃ³n MarÃ­a de Aldasoro, former trade and business secretary of the Basque government, who led the Euzkadi Delegation in Buenos Aires, Argentina. But Aldasoro's efforts on Aguirre's behalf were unsuccessful because the Argentine authorities sympathized with the European \"New Order.\"\n\nIn light of this, Aguirre went to Uruguay and asked a small group of Basque patriots for what Argentina had denied him. The Uruguayan president general Alfredo Baldomir not only was willing but also received Aguirre with honours in accordance with his status. Once the arrangements were complete, the public announcement of his arrival was made on 8 October in the newspapers of Montevideo. Aguirre's identity was reinstated, and he was given a visa to travel to New York, where he was put under the protection of resident Basques leading movements in Mexico and New York.\n\nIn New York, Aguirre took up a post as a lecturer at Columbia University. When the United States decided to back Franco in 1952, he went to France, where the Basque government-in-exile was established. There, he found that France's pro-Nazi Vichy government had sequestrated the Basque government building, and that President Charles de Gaulle was maintaining it on behalf of the Franco regime. The building is now the Instituto Cervantes.\n\nThe president of the government-in-exile was always a PNV member, and even the Spanish sole representative in the United Nations was a Basque appointee, JesÃºs de GalÃ­ndez, until his murder in an obscure episode at the time of Spain's entry to the United Nations. Aguirre also decided to place the large Basque exiles' network at the service of the Allies of World War II, and collaborated with the United States Secretary of State and the Central Intelligence Agency to defeat their common enemies.\n\nAguirre died in Paris on 22 March 1960 from a heart attack, aged 56. His body was shipped from Paris to Saint-Jean-de-Luz in the French Basque Country, where it spent a night in the MonzÃ³n house. He was buried on 28 March after a funeral mass at the Saint-Jean parish church.\n\nAguirre's life was the subject of a Soule folk play, \"Aguirre presidenta\" (\"President Aguirre\"). He wrote a book about his experiences, \"Escape Via Berlin: Eluding Franco in Hitler's Europe\" (New York, 1942).\n\n\n"}

In 1965 he was again appointed to a cabinet post, this time as Minister of Church Affairs and Education in the cabinet Borten, which lasted until 1971.\n\nWhen the cabinet Borten fell over a controversy related to the forthcoming EEC referendum, Bondevik was put in charge of tailoring a renewed centre-right coalition. However, the negotiations between the four parties failed, paving the way for a Labour cabinet Bratteli. In this context Bondevik described himself as \"djupt sÃ¥ra og vonbrÃ¥ten\", \"deeply hurt with broken hopes\". This is a well-known quote in Norwegian history.\n\nBondevik also worked at the University of Oslo from 1958 to 1965 and the University of Bergen as a lecturer from 1965 to 1970. In 1982 he was given an honorary doctorate at the University of TromsÃ¸, as the first person. He authored many books, mostly about history topics. Biographies about him were published in 1969 and 1981.\n\nKjell Bondevik is also known as the uncle of Kjell Magne Bondevik, later Prime Minister, and father of bishop Odd Bondevik.\n"}

Rogers, the woman who directed and developed the program for more than twelve years from 1985 to 1997. Maria gleaned information from hundreds of the program's oral history interviews for her book, \"In Other Words: Oral Histories of the Colorado Frontier\", which captures the personal and public history of the pioneers and early residents of Colorado.\n\nThe Maria Rogers Oral History Program Collection contained more than 1,650 interviews as of 2010, with 40 to 100 new interviews being added each year. Many of the interviews have been recorded, transcribed and archived by volunteers for the program. Some interviews have been donated to the collection by other educational, governmental, and cultural organizations or individuals in the community.\n\nThe interviews are about all aspects of life in Boulder County, providing a detailed account of both daily life and major events. The lives of a wide range of people are recorded, including pioneers and other settlers, cattlemen, farmers, housewives, university professors, local government officials and political activists, attorneys, physicians, coal miners, teachers, artists, scientists, and more. Although interviews are drawn from residents of Boulder County, they often cover topics that are of general interest, such as city planning and open space, political activism, mountaineering and issues involving the disposal of nuclear waste, among many others.\n\nDonations from the Rogers family and from the Boulder Library Foundation have allowed the program to digitize all of its interviews and create a digital archive that is linked to the Boulder Public Library's catalog, making it easy to research the contents of the interviews by doing a search for names, places or keywords. \n\nThe collection is housed in the Carnegie Library for Local History, a branch of the Boulder Public Library, located at 1125 Pine Street in Boulder, Colorado.

{"id": "20426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20426", "title": "Metonic cycle", "text": "Metonic cycle\n\nFor astronomy and calendar studies, the Metonic cycle or Enneadecaeteris (from , \"nineteen years\") is a period of very close to 19 years that is nearly a common multiple of the solar year and the synodic (lunar) month. The Greek astronomer Meton of Athens (fifth century BC) observed that a period of 19 years is almost exactly equal to 235 synodic months and, rounded to full days, counts 6,940 days. The difference between the two periods (of 19 years and 235 synodic months) is only a few hours, depending on the definition of the year.\n\nConsidering a year to be of this 6,940-day cycle gives a year length of 365Â +Â Â +Â  days (the unrounded cycle is much more accurate), which is about 11 days more than 12 synodic months. To keep a 12-month lunar year in pace with the solar year, an intercalary 13th month would have to be added on seven occasions during the nineteen-year period (235 = 19 Ã 12 + 7). When Meton introduced the cycle around 432Â BC, it was already known by Babylonian astronomers. A mechanical computation of the cycle is built into the Antikythera mechanism.\n\nThe cycle was used in the Babylonian calendar, ancient Chinese calendar systems (the 'Rule Cycle' ç« ) and the medieval computus (\"i.e.\", the calculation of the date of Easter). It regulates the 19-year cycle of intercalary months of the modern Hebrew calendar. The start of the Metonic cycle depends on which of these systems is being used; for Easter, the first year of the current Metonic cycle is 2014.\n\nAt the time of Meton, axial precession had not yet been discovered, and he could not distinguish between sidereal years (currently: 365.256363 days) and tropical years (currently: 365.242190 days). Most calendars, like the commonly used Gregorian calendar, are based on the tropical year and maintain the seasons at the same calendar times each year. Nineteen tropical years are about two hours shorter than 235 synodic months. The Metonic cycle's error is, therefore, one full day every 219 years, or 12.4 parts per million.\n\nNote that the 19-year cycle is also close (to somewhat more than half a day) to 255 draconic months, so it is also an eclipse cycle, which lasts only for about 4 or 5 recurrences of eclipses. The Octon is of a Metonic cycle (47 synodic months, 3.8 years), and it recurs about 20 to 25 cycles.\n\nThis cycle seems to be a coincidence. The periods of the Moon's orbit around the Earth and the Earth's orbit around the Sun are believed to be independent, and not to have any known physical resonance. An example of a non-coincidental cycle is the orbit of Mercury, with its 3:2 spin-orbit resonance.\n\nA lunar year of 12 synodic months is about 354 days, approximately 11 days short of the \"365-day\" solar year. Therefore, for a lunisolar calendar, every 2 to 3 years there is a difference of more than a full lunar month between the lunar and solar years, and an extra (\"embolismic\") month needs to be inserted (intercalation). The Athenians initially seem not to have had a regular means of intercalating a 13th month; instead, the question of when to add a month was decided by an official. Meton's discovery made it possible to propose a regular intercalation scheme. The Babylonians seem to have introduced this scheme around 500 BC, thus well before Meton.\n\nTraditionally, for the Babylonian and Hebrew lunisolar calendars, the years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 are the long (13-month) years of the Metonic cycle. This cycle, which can be used to predict eclipses, forms the basis of the Greek and Hebrew calendars, and is used for the computation of the date of Easter each year.\n\nThe Babylonians applied the 19-year cycle since the late sixth century BC. As they measured the moon's motion against the stars, the 235:19 relationship may originally have referred to sidereal years, instead of tropical years as it has been used for various calendars.\n\nAccording to Livy, the king of Rome Numa Pompilius (753-673 BC) inserted intercalary months in such a way that \"in the twentieth year the days should fall in with the same position of the sun from which they had started.\" As \"the twentieth year\" takes place nineteen years after \"the first year\", this seems to indicate that the Metonic cycle was applied to Numa's calendar.\n\nApollo was said to have visited the Hyperboreans once every 19 years, presumably at the high point of the cycle.\n\nThe Runic calendar is a perpetual calendar based on the 19-year-long Metonic cycle. Also known as a Rune staff or Runic Almanac, it appears to have been a medieval Swedish invention. This calendar does not rely on knowledge of the duration of the tropical year or of the occurrence of leap years. It is set at the beginning of each year by observing the first full moon after the winter solstice. The oldest one known, and the only one from the Middle Ages, is the NykÃ¶ping staff, which is believed to date from the 13th century.\n\nThe BahÃ¡'Ã­ calendar, established during the middle of the 19th century, is also based on cycles of 19 years.\n\nThe Metonic cycle is related to two less accurate subcycles:\n\n\nBy combining appropriate numbers of 11-year and 19-year periods, it is possible to generate ever more accurate cycles. For example, simple arithmetic shows that:\n\n\nThis gives an error of only about half an hour in 687 years (2.5 seconds a year), although this is subject to secular variation in the length of the tropical year and the lunation.\n\nMeton of Athens approximated the cycle to a whole number (6,940) of days, obtained by 125 long months of 30 days and 110 short months of 29 days. During the next century, Callippus developed the Callippic cycle of four 19-year periods for a 76-year cycle with a mean year of exactly 365.25 days.\n\n\n\n"}

Meillet (1907), who suggested derivation from the Proto-Indo-European root \"*mey-\" \"to exchange.\"\n\nA suggested alternative derivation was \"*meh\" \"to measure\" (Gray 1929). Pokorny (IEW 1959) refined Meillet's \"*mei\" as \"to bind.\" Combining the root \"*mei\" with the \"tool suffix\" \"-tra-\" \"that which [causes] ...\" (also found in \"man-tra-\", \"that which causes to think\"), then literally means \"that which binds,\" and thus \"covenant, treaty, agreement, promise, oath\" etc. Pokorny's interpretation also supports \"to fasten, strengthen\", which may be found in Latin \"moenia\" \"city wall, fortification\", and in an antonymic form, Old English \"(ge)maere\" \"border, boundary-post\".\n\nMeillet and Pokorny's \"contract\" did however have its detractors. Lentz (1964, 1970) refused to accept abstract \"contract\" for so exalted a divinity and preferred the more religious \"piety.\" Because present-day Sanskrit \"mitra\" means \"friend,\" and New Persian \"mihr\" means \"love\" or \"friendship,\" Gonda (1972, 1973) insisted on a Vedic meaning of \"friend, friendship,\" not \"contract\".\n\nMeillet's analysis also \"rectified earlier interpretations\" that suggested that the Indo-Iranian common noun \"*mitra-\" had anything to do with the light or the sun. When H. Lommel suggested that such an association was implied in the Younger Avesta (since the 6th century BCE), that too was conclusively dismissed. Today, it is certain that \"(al)though MiÎ¸ra is closely associated with the sun in the Avesta, he is not the sun\" and \"Vedic Mitra is not either.\"\n\nOld Persian \"MiÎ¸ra\" or \"MiÎ¸a\" â both only attested in a handful of 4th-century BCE inscriptions of Artaxerxes II and III â \"is generally admitted [to be] a borrowing from the Avesta,\" the genuine Old Persian form being reconstructed as \"*MiÃ§a\". (Kent initially suggested Sanskrit but later changed his mind). Middle Iranian \"myhr\" (Parthian, also in living Armenian usage) and \"mihr\" (Middle Persian), derive from Avestan \"Mithra\". \n\nGreek/Latin \"Mithras,\" the focal deity of the Greco-Roman cult of Mithraism is the nominative form of vocative Mithra. In contrast to the original Avestan meaning of \"contract\" or \"covenant\" (and still evident in post-Sassanid Middle Persian texts), the Greco-Roman Mithraists probably thought the name meant \"mediator.\" In Plutarch's 1st-century discussion of dualistic theologies, \"Isis and Osiris\" (46.7) the Greek historiographer provides the following explanation of the name in his summary of the Zoroastrian religion: Mithra is a \"meson\" (\"in the middle\") between \"the good Horomazdes and the evil Aremanius [...] and this is why the \"PÃ©rsai\" call the Mediator Mithra\". Zaehner attributes this false etymology to a role that Mithra (and the sun!) played in the now extinct branch of Zoroastrianism known as Zurvanism.\n\nVedic Mitra is a prominent deity of the Rigveda distinguished by a relationship to Varuna, the protector of \"rta\". Together with Varuna, he counted among the Adityas, a group of solar deities, also in later Vedic texts. Vedic Mitra is the patron divinity of honesty, friendship, contracts and meetings.\n\nThe first extant record of Indic Mitra, in the form \"mi-it-ra-\", is in the inscribed peace treaty of c. 1400 BC between Hittites and the Hurrian kingdom of the Mitanni in the area southeast of Lake Van in Asia Minor. Mitra appears there together with four other Indic divinities as witnesses and keepers of the pact.\n\nIn Zoroastrianism, Mithra is a member of the trinity of \"ahuras\", protectors of \"asha/arta\", \"truth\" or \"[that which is] right\". Mithra's standard appellation is \"of wide pastures\" suggesting omnipresence. Mithra is \"truth-speaking, ... with a thousand ears, ... with ten thousand eyes, high, with full knowledge, strong, sleepless, and ever awake.\" (\"Yasht\" 10.7). As preserver of covenants, Mithra is also protector and keeper of all aspects of interpersonal relationships, such as friendship and love.\n\nRelated to his position as protector of truth, Mithra is a judge (\"ratu\"), ensuring that individuals who break promises or are not righteous (\"artavan\") are not admitted to paradise. As also in Indo-Iranian tradition, Mithra is associated with (the divinity of) the sun but originally distinct from it. Mithra is closely associated with the feminine yazata Aredvi Sura Anahita, the hypostasis of knowledge.\n\nThere is a deity Mithra mentioned on monuments in Commagene. According to the archaeologist Maarten Vermaseren, 1stÂ centuryÂ BC evidence from Commagene demonstrates the \"reverence paid to Mithras\" but does not refer to \"the mysteries\". In the colossal statuary erected by King AntiochusÂ I (69â34Â BC) at Mount Nemrut, Mithras is shown beardless, wearing a Phrygian cap, and was originally seated on a throne alongside other deities and the king himself. On the back of the thrones there is an inscription in Greek, which includes the name Apollo Mithras Helios in the genitive case (á¼ÏÏÎ»Î»ÏÎ½Î¿Ï ÎÎ¯Î¸ÏÎ¿Ï á¼©Î»Î¯Î¿Ï). Vermaseren also reports about a Mithras cult in the 3rdÂ centuryÂ BC. Fayum. R. D. Barnett has argued that the royal seal of King Saussatar of Mitanni from c.Â 1450Â BC. depicts a tauroctonous Mithras.\n\nMaitreya is sometimes represented seated on a throne, and venerated both in MahÄyÄna and non-MahÄyÄna Buddhism. Some have speculated that inspiration for Maitreya may have come from the ancient Indo-Iranian deity Mithra. The primary comparison between the two characters appears to be the similarity of their names. According to \"The Religion of the Iranian Peoples\", \"No one who has studied the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyants or the coming saviour-prophets can fail to see their resemblance to the future Maitreya.\n\nPaul Williams claims that some Zoroastrian ideas like Saoshyant influenced the beliefs about Maitreya, such as \"expectations of a heavenly helper, the need to opt for positive righteousness, the future millennium, and universal salvation\". Possible objections are that these characteristics are not unique to Zoroastrianism, nor are they necessarily characteristic of the belief in Maitreya.\n\nThe name Mithra was adopted by the Greeks and Romans as \"Mithras\", chief figure in the mystery religion of Mithraism. At first identified with the Sun-god Helios by the Greeks, the syncretic Mithra-Helios was transformed into the figure Mithras during the 2nd century BC, probably at Pergamon. This new cult was taken to Rome around the 1st century BC and was dispersed throughout the Roman Empire. Popular among the Roman military, Mithraism was spread as far north as Hadrian's Wall and the Germanic Limes.\n"}

LorkoviÄ led the LorkoviÄ-VokiÄ plot, an attempt to establish a coalition government between the UstaÅ¡e and the Croatian Peasant Party and align the Independent State of Croatia with the Allies.\n\nAs a student, he joined the Croatian Party of Rights but, viewed as a dissident in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, he fled the country to avoid arrest and eventually settled in Germany where he obtained a doctorate in law at the University of Berlin. In 1934, he joined the UstaÅ¡e and became a close associate of Ante PaveliÄ. Although he was initially commander of all UstaÅ¡e in Germany, where he sought support in creating and protecting a Croatian state, he later became leader of all UstaÅ¡e outside Italy. Soon after the establishment of the NDH, he was appointed as Foreign Minister and strongly opposed Italian influence on the state. After his cabinet chief, Ivo Kolak, was executed in 1943 for smuggling gold, LorkoviÄ was removed from office but later named Minister of Interior. As Minister of Interior, he negotiated with the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) in the hopes of establishing a coalition government. He also held secret negotiations with HSS representatives to propose having the NDH join the Allies against Germany. Although he apparently had the support of PaveliÄ, he and his cohorts were soon arrested as conspirators against the state and after a period in detention was executed at the end of April 1945 alongside Ante VokiÄ.\n\nLorkoviÄ was born in Zagreb on 1 March 1909, the son of prominent politician Ivan LorkoviÄ. He attended gymnasium in Zagreb where he became a supporter of the Croatian Party of Rights and later joined the Croatian Youth Movement. He began law studies at the University of Zagreb, but completed them in Innsbruck, Austria, following his escape. He later earned a Ph.D on the subject of the \"Establishment of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs\" under Max Hildebert Boehm at the University of Berlin. LorkoviÄ and Branimir JeliÄ spoke about the state of Croatian university students at the International Students Federation congress in Brussels in 1930 for which they were arrested and held at the Palace of Justice before being taken to the German border. During his time in Berlin he met and later married Wally Marquead. He later divorced Marquead, and on 19 August 1944 he remarried to the Countess Nada von Ghyczy.\n\nOn 6 January 1929, King Alexander dissolved the government and introduced a royal dictatorship over the newly created Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Because he was viewed as a dissident, LorkoviÄ was placed under constant police surveillance. On 15 November 1929, a warrant for his arrest was issued, but he succeeded in escaping to Austria and later to Germany.\n\nLorkoviÄ was a keen advocate for the amalgamation of all Croatian parties into a 'super-party' to secede from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and on 4 October 1934 swore his UstaÅ¡e oath. He became commander of all UstaÅ¡e units in Germany and later, after the assassination of King Alexander, commander of all UstaÅ¡e outside Italy. The assassination of King Alexander led to him being briefly detained in Germany, but was released in mid-1935 after a German court rejected a Yugoslav request for his extradition.\n\nIn 1937, LorkoviÄ was arrested following a hearing conducted by the Gestapo. He subsequently left Germany and moved to Hungary and in 1939 returned to Yugoslavia, where he became an associate editor of the \"Hrvatski narod\" (\"Croatian Folk\") journal and the editor of the underground journal \"Hrvatska poÅ¡ta\" (\"The Croatian Post\"). \"Matica hrvatska\" published his book, \"The Croatian People and Their Lands\", in 1939 in which he stated that all Bosnian Muslims were Croats by nationality. After the Banovina of Croatia proclamation, he was arrested in 1940 and detained at Lepoglava prison and later in KruÅ¡Äica, near Vitez. LorkoviÄ was a signatory to a declaration, made on 31 March 1941 and signed on 5 May 1941, in which the UstaÅ¡e requested the declaration of a Croatian state. The document also sought German support, protection and recognition among Axis nations.\n\nLorkoviÄ was one of the most pro-German members of the pre-war UstaÅ¡e movement having cultivated political and academic ties in Germany during his time there. After the establishment of the NDH, LorkoviÄ became a member of the temporary government of Slavko Kvaternik known as the Croatian State Leadership. On 16 April 1941, LorkoviÄ was named Secretary of the Foreign Ministry in the first government formed by Ante PaveliÄ, who also served as Foreign Minister. Up to April 1943, he also served as the chief contact between Edmund Glaise von Horstenau, the Plenipotentiary General in the Independent State of Croatia, and the PaveliÄ cabinet.\n\nLorkoviÄ succeeded PaveliÄ as Foreign Minister on 9 June 1941. Shortly after taking office, he inquired with the French authorities about the fate of three UstaÅ¡e implicated in the 1934 assassination of King Alexander in Marseilles and sentenced to life imprisonment. The actual assassin was a Bulgarian mercenary, Vlado Chernozemski, who was killed after the deed by French security forces. Two of the men died in prison, but the third, Milan RajiÄ, was returned to the NDH in early 1942 through the intervention of the German occupation forces in France, where he was later killed allegedly on PaveliÄ's orders.\n\nOn 27 July 1941, in a speech designed to inflame Croats against the Serbs living in the NDH, LorkoviÄ lied that Serbs had beaten, mutilated and massacred tens of thousands of Croatian peasants during the inter-war period. In August, he strongly opposed an Italian request to implement civil administration in the demilitarized zone of the NDH. The Italians countered the following spring by accusing LorkoviÄ of being a communist to discredit him for his pro-German views. LorkoviÄ was cleared of all charges after a police investigation. However, a German police attachÃ© in Zagreb did claim that LorkoviÄ had been in contact with some communists in the early 1930s and had helped some Croatian communists in 1941 and 1942. In May 1942, LorkoviÄ was appointed honorary member of the German Institute for Border and Foreign Studies. LorkoviÄ, along with Vladimir KoÅ¡ak and Stijepo PeriÄ, strongly opposed Italian influence over the Independent State of Croatia and towards the end of 1942, wrote a note (\"Spomenica\") in which he described the cooperative efforts of Italy's 2nd Army with the Chetniks. This note was officially submitted on 26 January 1943 to the Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano. In response, the Italian diplomat Raffaele Casertano tried to have LorkoviÄ removed from office.\n\nHeinrich Himmler, leader of the German \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS), wanted to form a Croatian Muslim SS division. He sent Phleps as his representative to Zagreb to begin formal negotiations with the Croatian government on 18 February 1943. He met with German foreign ministry envoy Siegfried Kasche and Mladen LorkoviÄ who represented PaveliÄ. PaveliÄ had already agreed to raise the division but the Waffen SS and Croatian government disagreed on how the division would be recruited and controlled. LorkoviÄ suggested that it be named \"SS \"UstaÅ¡a\" Division\", a Croatian unit raised with SS assistance, with familiar regimental titles such as \"Bosna\", \"Krajina\" and \"Una\". PaveliÄ and Kasche were concerned that an exclusively Muslim division might aid a Muslim bid for independence. As a compromise, the word \"Croatian\" was included in its official title and some Croatian Catholic officers were recruited. Himmler and Phleps largely prevailed and created the division as they saw fit causing grave dissatisfaction among the NDH leadership, particularly regarding its ethnic composition.\n\nOn 23 April 1943 LorkoviÄ was removed from office after LorkoviÄ's cabinet chief, Ivo Kolak, was found guilty of gold smuggling and executed. Following his removal, LorkoviÄ was named a Minister in Government's Presidency, where he was responsible for relations with the German Army, and become a close associate of General Edmund Glaise von Horstenau. During the summer of 1943, he advocated cooperation with the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and represented the \"UstaÅ¡e\" in negotiations with the vice president of the HSS, August KoÅ¡utiÄ, about forming a coalition government. LorkoviÄ advocated a stronger government and greater independence in its activity. He initiated a new government to be led by himself as a prime minister and not the \"Poglavnik\", but PaveliÄ named Nikola MandiÄ as prime minister on 2 September 1942. LorkoviÄ and some of his associates submitted their resignations, which were not accepted. Despite this setback, LorkoviÄ, along with MandiÄ, continued negotiations with HSS throughout September finalising them at the end of the month.\n\nAfter the capitulation of Italy on 20 September 1943, LorkoviÄ, with Kasche and other high-ranking German officers, discussed the return of territory lost after the Treaty of Rome in April 1941. Ultimately, Hitler gave permission for the Independent State of Croatia to annex the territory by \"guaranteeing unlimited independence of Croatia, including this Croatian Adriatic coast.\"\n\nOn 11 October 1943, LorkoviÄ was named Minister of Interior, where he advocated stricter policing, and a second term as Foreign Minister from 29 April until 5 May 1944, after his friend PeriÄ was removed from office. It was agreed that LorkoviÄ would remain Foreign Minister and Minister of Interior simultaneously, but was soon replaced by Mehmed AlajbegoviÄ as Foreign Minister. After realising that Germany would lose the war and the NDH would cease to exist, he advocated radical changes in state policy. In February 1944, he wrote a detailed memorandum in German which summarized the history, current situation and the fundamental problems of the NDH and its Armed Forces, as well as problems with the German Army.\n\nIn May 1944, he secretly met with the president of Knin County, David SinÄiÄ, with whom he discussed the poor state of the German war-effort and that the Allies may invade the Balkans via Taranto. That month, he launched an initiative to renew negotiations with the HSS, which he conducted in his apartment. There, he secretly met with SinÄiÄ, August KoÅ¡utiÄ and Ivanko Farolfi. LorkoviÄ also sought foreign contacts and through Switzerland made contact with British and American officials, but was rebuffed. He proposed that the NDH end its relations with Germany and join the Allies, a proposal supported by the Minister of the Armed Forces, Ante VokiÄ, as well as many high-ranking Croatian Home Guard officers and politicians. LorkoviÄ also negotiatied with the HSS about switching sides with PaveliÄ's knowledge and consent.\n\nAt a special session of government held on 30 August 1944 in PaveliÄ's villa, guarded by armed men, LorkoviÄ and VokiÄ were accused of conspiracy against the \"Poglavnik\" and Croatia's German ally. Vice President of the Government, DÅ¾afer KulenoviÄ, and many others defended them but to no avail. LorkoviÄ was kept under house arrest until he was tried before the Poglavnik's Bodyguard Division (PTS) where it was decided that he would be stripped of his rank and expelled from the PTS. After the trial, he was transferred to Koprivnica and later in Lepoglava, alongside VokiÄ, Farolfi, Ljudevit TomaÅ¡iÄ and others, although KoÅ¡turiÄ later escaped. LorkoviÄ was executed at the end of April 1945.\n\nLorkoviÄ's publications during the time of the NDH were closely tied with his political activity and state obligations. He cooperated with a number of magazines, such as \"Croatia\", which was published by HIBZ in German and French for the Foreign Ministry.\n\nIn 1939, \"Matica hrvatska\" published his book, \"The Croatian People and Their Lands\" (\"Narod i zemlja Hrvata\"), in which LorkoviÄ focused on the issue of Croatian boundaries. In 1942, he participated in the Croatian Parliament (\"Sabor\"). Two of his speeches were independently published: \"The International Political Position of Croatia\" (\"MeÄunarodni politiÄki poloÅ¾aj Hrvatske\"; 1942) and \"The Croatian Struggle Against Bolshevism\" (\"Hrvatska u borbi protiv boljÅ¡evizma\"; 1944). The latter was published in German in 1944.\n\n"}

{"id": "30074607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30074607", "title": "Postmodern religion", "text": "Postmodern religion\n\nPostmodern religion is any type of religion that is influenced by postmodernism and postmodern philosophies. Examples of religions that may be interpreted using postmodern philosophy include Postmodern Christianity, Postmodern Neopaganism, and Postmodern Buddhism. Postmodern religion is not an attempt to banish religion from the public sphere; rather, it is a philosophical approach to religion that critically considers orthodox assumptions (that may reflect power differences in society rather than universal truths). Postmodern religious systems of thought view realities as plural and subjective and dependent on the individual's worldview. Postmodern interpretations of religion acknowledge and value a multiplicity of diverse interpretations of truth, being and ways of seeing. There is a rejection of sharp distinctions and global or dominant metanarratives in postmodern religion and this reflects one of the core principles of postmodern philosophy. A postmodern interpretation of religion emphasises the key point that religious truth is highly individualistic, subjective and resides within the individual.\n\nAccording to postmodern philosophy, society is in a state of constant change. There is no absolute version of reality, no absolute truths. Postmodern religion strengthens the perspective of the individual and weakens the strength of institutions and religions that deal with objective realities. Postmodern religion considers that there are no universal religious truths or laws, rather, reality is shaped by social, historical and cultural contexts according to the individual, place and or time. Individuals may seek to draw eclectically on diverse religious beliefs, practices and rituals in order to incorporate these into their own religious world view.\n\nIn Japan, Shinto and Buddhist ideas are woven together and co-exist. Some people who practice Buddhism may be syncretic in their approach. Syncretism occurs among the Eastern religions. Similarly, versions of Hinduism and Neopaganism may also be interpreted from a postmodern perspective. A postmodern religion can be non-dogmatic, syncretic, and eclectic: in drawing from various faiths and traditions, it challenges the notion of absolute truths.\n\nHistory may be written by powerful groups in society, who may marginalise, silence or misrepresent other, less powerful or oppressed groups. As Winston Churchill famously remarked, \"History is written by the victors.\"\n\nA postmodern interpretation of religion emphasises the importance of questioning and considering historical bias when studying religion from a historical perspective. For example, doctoral studies in religion at Harvard emphasise studying religion using wider contexts of history and comparative studies. It is these \"wider contexts\" that makes religion a valid subject of postmodern contemplation. Studies of religion are often approached from a historical perspective. A postmodern interpretation of a religion acknowledges that history can be represented in an inherently biased way, reinforcing the mainstream ideologies of those in power.\n\nPostmodern religion acknowledges and accepts different versions of truth. For example, rituals, beliefs and practices can be invented, transformed, created and reworked based on constantly shifting and changing realities, individual preference, myths, legends, archetypes, rituals and cultural values and beliefs. Individuals who interpret religion using postmodern philosophy may draw from the histories of various cultures to inform their religious beliefs - they may question, reclaim, challenge and critique representations of religion in history based on the theories of postmodernism, which acknowledge that realities are diverse, subjective and depend on the individuals interests and interpretations.\n\nMembers of groups in society who face discrimination or who are marginalized, such as women, the gay community or other ethnic minority groups, may be drawn to postmodern religious thinking. For example, the interpretation of Christianity from a postmodern perspective offers the potential for groups in society, such as the Gay community or women, the ability to connect with a version of reality or truth that does not exclude or marginalize them. A postmodern interpretation of religion may focus on considering a religion without orthodox assumptions (that may reflect power differences in society rather than universal truths). In Semitic Neopaganism, a postmodern approach to this tradition of Neopaganism involves challenging or reclaiming mainstream versions of reality and truth that may be more inclusive of women. Minority groups and the socially or economically disadvantaged may be drawn to follow a postmodern approach to religion, because of the way that postmodern philosophy empowers the individual and provides an \"emancipatory framework\" with which to challenge mainstream ideologies or dominant power structures.\n\nInterpreting Christianity using theories of postmodernism usually involves finding the balance between acknowledging pluralism, a plurality of views and historical influence on doctrine and avoiding the extremes of postmodernism. John Riggs proposes that postmodernism and Christianity have much to offer each other. He asserts that Christians who have adopted elements of postmodern thinking still need to acknowledge that some notions of reality need to be fixed and real in order to have \"meaningful claims about vital topics such as ethics and God\". An example of a specific religious movement that uses postmodern thinking is the Emerging Church.\n\nNeopaganism can be interpreted from a postmodern perspective. Postmodern religion can be non-dogmatic, syncretic, eclectic, and draw from various faiths and traditions and challenges the notion of absolute truths. Wicca, the largest tradition of Neopaganism, can be interpreted using postmodern philosophies. Postmodern interpretations of Wicca often lead to the practitioner adopting a more eclectic approach, because the very nature of postmodern theory involves the acceptance of many versions of truth and reality.\n\nEclectic Wicca is the most widely adapted form of Wicca in America today and the core philosophies of postmodern thinking are often used in order to form an interpretation of Wicca that is highly individual and characterized by the subjective questioning of reality and truth. This version of Wicca may draw eclectically from, adapt, challenge and adopt a wider range of religious beliefs and perspectives, such as Buddhism, Shintoism, Druidism and Hinduism and Wicca and Goddess movements such as Dianic Wicca, Celtic Wicca and Semitic Neopaganism.\n\nPostmodern interpretations of Wicca tend to be context driven, egalitarian, immanent and experiential. Academic texts often represent Wicca in literature and research as a specific tradition that is underpinned by discourses of modernism.\n\nPostmodern spirituality refers to new forms of spirituality in the contexts of postmodern societies in a globalised world. Former universalistic worldviews of modernity become contested, old explanations and certainties questioned.\n\n"}

{"id": "28380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28380", "title": "Sergei Eisenstein", "text": "Sergei Eisenstein\n\nSergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein (; 11Â February 1948) was a Soviet film director and film theorist, a pioneer in the theory and practice of montage. He is noted in particular for his silent films \"Strike\" (1925), \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) and \"\" (1928), as well as the historical epics \"Alexander Nevsky\" (1938) and \"Ivan the Terrible\" (1944, 1958). In their decennial poll, the \"Sight and Sound\" magazine named his \"Battleship Potemkin\" the 11th greatest movie of all time.\n\nEisenstein was born to a middle-class family in Riga, Latvia (then part of the Russian Empire in the Governorate of Livonia), but his family moved frequently in his early years, as Eisenstein continued to do throughout his life. His father, the famous architect Mikhail Osipovich Eisenstein, was born in Kiev Oblast, to a Jewish merchant family originating from Vasylkiv. The family had converted to the Russian Orthodox Church. His mother, Julia Ivanovna Konetskaya, was from a Russian Orthodox family. She was the daughter of a prosperous merchant. Julia left Riga the same year as the Russian Revolution of 1905, taking Sergei with her to St. Petersburg. Her son would return at times to see his father, who joined them around 1910. Divorce followed and Julia left the family to live in France. Eisenstein was raised as an Orthodox Christian, but became an atheist later on.\n\nAt the Petrograd Institute of Civil Engineering, Sergei studied architecture and engineering, the profession of his father. In 1918 Sergei left school and joined the Red Army to serve the Bolshevik Revolution, although his father Mikhail supported the opposite side. This brought his father to Germany after the defeat of the Tsarist government, and Sergei to Petrograd, Vologda, and Dvinsk. In 1920, Sergei was transferred to a command position in Minsk, after success providing propaganda for the October Revolution. At this time, he was exposed to Kabuki theatre and studied Japanese, learning some 300 kanji characters, which he cited as an influence on his pictorial development. These studies would lead him to travel to Japan.\n\nIn 1920 Eisenstein moved to Moscow, and began his career in theatre working for Proletkult. His productions there were entitled \"Gas Masks\", \"Listen Moscow\", and \"Wiseman\". Eisenstein worked as a designer for Vsevolod Meyerhold. In 1923 Eisenstein began his career as a theorist, by writing \"The Montage of Attractions\" for art journal \"LEF\". Eisenstein's first film, \"Glumov's Diary\" (for the theatre production \"Wiseman\"), was also made in that same year with Dziga Vertov hired initially as an \"instructor\" \n\n\"Strike\" (1925) was Eisenstein's first full-length feature film. \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) was acclaimed critically worldwide. It was mostly his international critical renown which enabled Eisenstein to direct \"\" (also known as \"Ten Days That Shook The World\") as part of a grand tenth anniversary celebration of the October Revolution of 1917, and then \"The General Line\" (also known as \"Old and New\"). Internationally, critics praised the films, but at home, Eisenstein's focus in these films on structural issues such as camera angles, crowd movements, and montage brought him and like-minded others, such as Vsevolod Pudovkin and Alexander Dovzhenko, under fire from the Soviet film community, forcing him to issue public articles of self-criticism and commitments to reform his cinematic visions to conform to the increasingly specific doctrines of socialist realism.\nIn the autumn of 1928, with \"October\" still under fire in many Soviet quarters, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe, accompanied by his perennial film collaborator Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse. Officially, the trip was supposed to allow Eisenstein and company to learn about sound motion pictures and to present the Soviet artists in person to the capitalist West. For Eisenstein, however, it was also an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside the Soviet Union. He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin, ZÃ¼rich, London, and Paris. In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by TissÃ© entitled \"Frauennot - FrauenglÃ¼ck\".\n\nIn late April 1930, Jesse L. Lasky, on behalf of Paramount Pictures, offered Eisenstein the opportunity to make a film in the United States. He accepted a short-term contract for $100,000 ($1,500,000 in 2017 dollars) and arrived in Hollywood in May 1930, along with Aleksandrov and Tisse.\n\nEisenstein proposed a biography of munitions tycoon Basil Zaharoff and a film version of \"Arms and the Man\" by George Bernard Shaw, and more fully developed plans for a film of \"Sutter's Gold\" by Blaise Cendrars, but on all accounts failed to impress the studio's producers. Paramount proposed a film version of Theodore Dreiser's \"An American Tragedy\". This excited Eisenstein, who had read and liked the work, and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow. Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930, but Paramount disliked it completely and, additionally, found themselves intimidated by Major Frank Pease, president of the Hollywood Technical Director's Institute. Pease, an anti-communist, mounted a public campaign against Eisenstein. On October 23, 1930, by \"mutual consent\", Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract null and void, and the Eisenstein party were treated to return tickets to Moscow at Paramount's expense.\n\nEisenstein was thus faced with returning home a failure. The Soviet film industry was solving the sound-film issue without him and his films, techniques, and theories, such as Eisenstein's formalist film theory, were becoming increasingly attacked as 'ideological failures'. Many of his theoretical articles from this period, such as \"Eisenstein on Disney\", have surfaced decades later as seminal scholarly texts used as curriculum in film schools around the world.\n\nEisenstein and his entourage spent considerable time with Charlie Chaplin, who recommended that Eisenstein meet with a sympathetic benefactor in the person of American socialist author Upton Sinclair. Sinclair's works had been accepted by and were widely read in the USSR, and were known to Eisenstein. The two had mutual admiration and between the end of October 1930 and Thanksgiving of that year, Sinclair had secured an extension of Eisenstein's absences from the USSR, and permission for him to travel to Mexico. The trip to Mexico was for Eisenstein to make a film produced by Sinclair and his wife, Mary Craig Kimbrough Sinclair, and three other investors organized as the \"Mexican Film Trust\".\n\nOn 24 November 1930, Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust \"upon the basis of his desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be, and in full faith in Eisenstein's artistic integrity.\" The contract also stipulated that the film would be \"non-political\", that immediately available funding came from Mary Sinclair in an amount of \"not less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars\", that the shooting schedule amounted to \"a period of from three to four months\", and most importantly that: \"Eisenstein furthermore agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico, all negative film and positive prints, and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture, will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair...\" A codicil to the contract allowed that the \"Soviet Government may have the [finished] film free for showing inside the U.S.S.R.\" Reportedly, it was verbally clarified that the expectation was for a finished film of about an hour's duration.\n\nBy 4 December, Eisenstein was en route to Mexico by train, accompanied by Aleksandrov and Tisse. Later he produced a brief synopsis of the six-part film which would come, in one form or another, to be the final plan Eisenstein would settle on for his project. The title for the project, \"Â¡Que viva MÃ©xico!\", was decided on some time later still. While in Mexico Eisenstein mixed socially with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Eisenstein admired these artists and Mexican culture in general, and they inspired Eisenstein to call his films \"moving frescoes\". The Left U.S. film community eagerly followed Eisenstein's progress within Mexico as is chronicled within Chris Robe's book \"Left of Hollywood: Cinema, Modernism, and the Emergence of U.S. Radical Film Culture\".\n\nAfter a prolonged absence, Stalin sent a telegram expressing the concern that Eisenstein had become a deserter. Under pressure, Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair's younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, who had been sent along to act as a line producer, for the film's problems. Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to insinuate themselves between him and Stalin, so Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way. The furious Sinclairs shut down production and ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage and the three Soviets to see what they could do with the film already shot, estimates ranging from 170,000 lineal feet with \"Soldadera\" unfilmed, to an excess of 250,000 lineal feet.\n\nFor the unfinished filming of the \"novel\" of \"Soldadera\", without incurring any cost, Eisenstein had secured 500 soldiers, 10,000 guns, and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army, but this was lost due to Sinclair's cancelling of production. When Eisenstein arrived at the American border, a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings of Jesus caricatures amongst other lewd pornographic material. His re-entry visa had expired, and Sinclair's contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension. Eisenstein, Aleksandrov, and Tisse were allowed, after a month's stay at the U.S.-Mexico border outside Laredo, Texas, a 30-day \"pass\" to get from Texas to New York, and thence depart for Moscow, while Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining film.\n\nEisenstein toured the American South, on his way to New York. In mid-1932, the Sinclairs were able to secure the services of Sol Lesser, who had just opened his distribution office in New York, Principal Distributing Corporation. Lesser agreed to supervise post-production work on the miles of negativeâat the Sinclairs' expenseâand distribute any resulting product. Two short feature films and a short subjectâ\"Thunder Over Mexico\" based on the \"Maguey\" footage, \"Eisenstein in Mexico\", and \"Death Day\" respectivelyâwere completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934. Eisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair-Lesser films, nor a later effort by his first biographer, Marie Seton, called \"Time in the Sun\", released in 1940. He would publicly maintain that he had lost all interest in the project. In 1978, Gregori Aleksandrov released - with the same name in contravention to the copyright - his own version, which was awarded with the Honorable Golden Prize at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979. Later, in 1998, Oleg Kovalov edited a free version of the film, calling it \"Mexican Fantasy\".\n\nEisenstein's foray into the West made the staunchly Stalinist film industry look upon him with a suspicion that would never completely disappear. He apparently spent some time in a mental hospital in Kislovodsk in July 1933, ostensibly a result of depression born of his final acceptance that he would never be allowed to edit the Mexican footage. He was subsequently assigned a teaching position at the State Institute of Cinematography where he had taught earlier and in 1933 and 1934 was in charge of writing curriculum.\n\nIn 1935, Eisenstein was assigned another project, \"Bezhin Meadow\", but it appears the film was afflicted with many of the same problems as \"Â¡Que viva MÃ©xico!\". Eisenstein unilaterally decided to film two versions of the scenario, one for adult viewers and one for children; failed to define a clear shooting schedule; and shot film prodigiously, resulting in cost overruns and missed deadlines. Boris Shumyatsky, the \"de facto\" head of the Soviet film industry, finally called a halt to the filming and cancelled further production. The thing which appeared to save Eisenstein's career at this point was that Stalin ended up taking the position that the \"Bezhin Meadow\" catastrophe, along with several other problems facing the industry at that point, had less to do with Eisenstein's approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been supervising him. Ultimately this came down on the shoulders of Shumyatsky, who in early 1938 was denounced, arrested, tried and convicted as a traitor, and shot.\n\nEisenstein was thence able to ingratiate himself with Stalin for 'one more chance', and he chose, from two offerings, the assignment of a biopic of \"Alexander Nevsky\", with music composed by Sergei Prokofiev. This time, he was assigned a co-scenarist, Pyotr Pavlenko, to bring in a completed script; professional actors to play the roles; and an assistant director, Dmitri Vasilyev, to expedite shooting.\n\nThe result was a film critically well received by both the Soviets and in the West, which won him the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize. It was an allegory and stern warning against the massing forces of Nazi Germany, well played and well made. The script had Nevsky utter a number of traditional Russian proverbs, verbally rooting his fight against the Germanic invaders in Russian traditions. This was started, completed, and placed in distribution all within the year 1938, and represented not only Eisenstein's first film in nearly a decade but also his first sound film.\n\nWithin months of its release, Stalin entered into a pact with Hitler, and \"Alexander Nevsky\" was promptly pulled from distribution. Eisenstein returned to teaching and was assigned to direct Richard Wagner's \"Die WalkÃ¼re\" at the Bolshoi Theatre. After the outbreak of war with Germany in 1941, \"Alexander Nevsky\" was re-released with a wide distribution and earned international success. With the war approaching Moscow, Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to Alma-Ata, where he first considered the idea of making a film about Tsar Ivan IV. Eisenstein corresponded with Prokofiev from Alma-Ata, and was joined by him there in 1942. Prokofiev composed the score for Eisenstein's film and Eisenstein reciprocated by designing sets for an operatic rendition of \"War and Peace\" that Prokofiev was developing.\n\nEisenstein's film, \"Ivan the Terrible, Part I\", presenting Ivan IV of Russia as a national hero, won Joseph Stalin's approval (and a Stalin Prize), but the sequel, \"Ivan The Terrible, Part II\", was criticized by various authorities and would go unreleased until 1958. All footage from the still incomplete \"Ivan The Terrible, Part III\" was confiscated, and most of it was destroyed, though several filmed scenes exist.\n\nIn 1934, in the Soviet Union, Eisenstein married filmmaker and screenwriter Pera Atasheva (born Pearl Moiseyevna Fogelman; 1900 - 24 September 1965) and remained married until his death. They had no children.\n\nEisenstein suffered a heart attack on 2 February 1946, and spent much of the following year recovering. He died of a second heart attack on 11 February 1948, at the age of 50. His body lay in state in the Hall of the Cinema Workers before being cremated on 13 February, and his ashes were buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.\n\nEisenstein was a pioneer in the use of montage, a specific use of film editing. He and his contemporary, Lev Kuleshov, two of the earliest film theorists, argued that montage was the essence of the cinema. His articles and booksâparticularly \"Film Form\" and \"The Film Sense\"âexplain the significance of montage in detail.\n\nHis writings and films have continued to have a major impact on subsequent filmmakers. Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just expounding a scene or moment, through a \"linkage\" of related images. Eisenstein felt the \"collision\" of shots could be used to manipulate the emotions of the audience and create film metaphors. He believed that an idea should be derived from the juxtaposition of two independent shots, bringing an element of collage into film. He developed what he called \"methods of montage\":\n\nEisenstein taught film-making during his career at GIK where he wrote the curricula for the directors' course; his classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir NizhniÄ­'s \"Lessons with Eisenstein.\" Exercises and examples for students were based on rendering literature such as HonorÃ© de Balzac's \"Le PÃ¨re Goriot.\" Another hypothetical was the staging of the Haitian struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradov's \"The Black Consul,\" influenced as well by John Vandercook's \"Black Majesty.\"\n\nLessons from this scenario delved into the character of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, replaying his movements, actions, and the drama surrounding him. Further to the didactics of literary and dramatic content, Eisenstein taught the technicalities of directing, photography, and editing, while encouraging his students' development of individuality, expressiveness, and creativity. Eisenstein's pedagogy, like his films, was politically charged and contained quotes from Vladimir Lenin interwoven with his teaching.\n\nIn his initial films, Eisenstein did not use professional actors. His narratives eschewed individual characters and addressed broad social issues, especially class conflict. He used stock characters, and the roles were filled with untrained people from the appropriate classes; he avoided casting stars. Eisenstein's vision of communism brought him into conflict with officials in the ruling regime of Joseph Stalin. Like many Bolshevik artists, Eisenstein envisioned a new society which would subsidize artists totally, freeing them from the confines of bosses and budgets, leaving them absolutely free to create, but budgets and producers were as significant to the Soviet film industry as the rest of the world. Due to the fledgling war, the revolution-wracked and isolated new nation didn't have the resources to nationalize its film industry at first. When it did, limited resourcesâboth monetary and equipmentârequired production controls as extensive as in the capitalist world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.\n\nGenerally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self-chosen residence. Until now in Croatia there has been only one collocation of Stolpersteineâin 2013 in the Adriatic town Rijeka (, in Italian: \"Fiume\"). From 1466, this town was under Habsburg rule for four and half centuries, at last with two-thirds of its inhabitants being of Italian descent. Thereafter, Rijeka was independent for some years. From 1924 to the end of WW2, the city belonged to Italy. The name of the Stolpersteine in Croatian is \"Kamen spoticanja\", and in Italian: \"pietre d'inciampo\".\n\nThe collocation in Rijeka took place on 21 May 2013. For both victims two Stolpersteine were posed, one in Croatian and one in Italian. The planned collocation of a Stolperstein for Branko Lustig in Osijek on 22 May 2013 has probably not taken place.\n\n\n"}

The purpose is to assess the panspermia hypothesis and the possibility of natural interplanetary transport of microbial life as well as prebiotic organic compounds.\n\nThe collection and exposure phase took place from May 2015 through February 2018 utilizing the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of Kibo, the Japanese Experimental Module of the International Space Station. The mission, designed and performed by Japan, collected cosmic dust by using ultra-low density silica gel (aerogel), and are being analyzed for amino acid-related compounds and microorganisms following their return to Earth. The last samples were retrieved in February 2018 and analyses are ongoing. The principal investigator is Akihiko Yamagishi, who heads a team of researchers from 26 universities and institutions in Japan, including JAXA.\n\nThe capture and exposure experiments in the Tanpopo mission were designed to confirm the hypothesis that extraterrestrial organic compounds played important roles in the generation of the first terrestrial life, as well as examination of the hypothesis of panspermia. If the Tanpopo mission can detect microbes at the higher altitude of low Earth orbit (400Â km), it will support the possible interplanetary migration of terrestrial life. The mission was named after the plant dandelion (Tanpopo) because the plant's seeds evoke the image of seeds of lifeforms spreading out through space.\n\nThe Tanpopo mission exposures took place at the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of the Kibo module of the ISS from May 2015 through February 2018. It collected cosmic dust and exposed dehydrated microorganisms outside the International Space Station while orbiting above the Earth. These experiments will test some aspects of panspermia, a hypothesis for an exogenesis origin of life distributed by meteoroids, asteroids, comets and cosmic dust. This mission will also test if terrestrial microbes (e.g., aerosols embedding microbial colonies) may be present, even temporarily and in freeze-dried form in the low Earth orbit altitudes.\nThree key microorganisms include \"Deinococcus\" species: \"D. radiodurans\", \"D. aerius\" and \"D. aetherius\". Containers holding yeast and other microbes were also placed outside the Kibo module to examine whether microbes can survive being exposed to the harsh cold environment of outer space. Also, by evaluating retrieved samples of exposed terrestrial microbes and astronomical organic analogs on the exposure panels, they can investigate their survival and any alterations in the duration of interplanetary transport.\n\nResearchers also aim to capture organic compounds and prebiotic organic compounds â such as aminoacids â drifting in space. The mission collected cosmic dust and other particles for three years by using an ultra-low density silica gel called aerogel. Some of these aerogels were replaced every one to two years through February 2018.\n\nThe official ISS experiment code name is \"Astrobiology Japan\" representing \"Astrobiology exposure and micrometeoroid capture experiments\".\n\nThe objectives of Tanpopo lie in following 6 topics: \n\nThe aerogels were placed and retrieved by using the robotic arm outside Kibo. The first year samples were returned to Earth in mid-2016, panels from the second year were brought back in late 2017, and the last set ended exposure in February 2018. The last aerogels were placed inside the 'landing & return capsule' in early 2018 and ejected toward Earth for retrieval. After retrieving the aerogels, scientists are investigating the captured microparticles and tracks formed, followed by microbiological, organochemical and mineralogical analyses. Particles potentially containing microbes will be used for PCR amplification of rRNA genes followed by DNA sequencing.\n\nEarly mission results from the first sample show evidence that some clumps of microorganism can survive for at least one year in space. This may support the idea that clumps greater than 0.5 millimeters of microorganisms could be one way for life to spread from planet to planet. It was also noted that glycine's decomposition was less than expected, while hydantoin's recovery was much lower than glycine.\n\n\n"}

In the United Kingdom and numerous other countries vital records are recorded in the civil registry.\n\nVarious European countries are members of an International Commission on Civil Status which provides a mutually recognized convention on the coding of entries appearing in civil status documents, with common codes and translation tables between the language of the member states.

However, more than 100 developing countries still do not have functioning systems that can support efficient registration of births and other life events like marriages and death. Around the world, almost 230 million children under the age of five are not registered. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 85 million of these children, while 135 million live in Asia and the Pacific.

Certified copies are usually much more expensive than uncertified copies. Some states have started making vital records available online for free.

{"id": "2231892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2231892", "title": "War of succession", "text": "War of succession\n\nA war of succession or succession war is a war prompted by a succession crisis in which two or more individuals claim the right of successor to a deceased or deposed monarch. The rivals are typically supported by factions within the royal court. Foreign powers sometimes intervene, allying themselves with a faction. This may widen the war into one between those powers.\n\nIn historiography and literature, a \"war of succession\" may also be referred to as a \"succession dispute\", \"dynastic struggle\", \"internecine conflict\", \"fratricidal war\", or any combination of these terms. Not all of these are necessarily describing armed conflict, however, and the dispute may be resolved without escalating into open warfare. Wars of succession are also often referred to as a \"civil\" war, when in fact it was a conflict within the royalty, or broader aristocracy, that civilians were dragged into, and may therefore be a misnomer, or at least a misleading characterisation.\n\nA war of succession is a type of intrastate war concerning struggle for the throne: a conflict about supreme power in a monarchy. It may become an interstate war if foreign powers intervene. A succession war may arise after (or sometimes even before) a universally recognised ruler over a certain territory passes away (sometimes without leaving behind any (legal) offspring), or is declared insane or otherwise incapable to govern, and is deposed. Next, several pretenders step forward, who are either related to the previous ruler and therefore claim to have a right to their possessions based on the hereditary principle, or have concluded a treaty to that effect. They will seek allies within the nobility and/or abroad to support their claims to the throne. After all options for a diplomatic solution âsuch as a sharing of power, or a financial dealâ or a quick elimination âe.g. by assassination or arrestâ have been exhausted, a military confrontation will follow. Quite often such succession disputes can lead to long-lasting wars.\n\nSome wars of succession are about women's right to inherit. This does not exist in some countries (a \"sword fief\", where the Salic law applies, for example), but it does in others (a \"spindle fief\"). Often a ruler who has no sons, but does have one or more daughters, will try to change the succession laws so that a daughter can succeed him. Such amendments will then be declared invalid by opponents, invoking the local tradition.\n\nIn some cases, wars of succession could also be centred around the reign in prince-bishoprics. Although these were formally elective monarchies without hereditary succession, the election of the prince-bishop could be strongly intertwined with the dynastic interests of the noble families involved, each of whom would put forward their own candidates. In case of disagreement over the election result, waging war was a possible way of settling the conflict.\n\nIt can sometimes be difficult to determine whether a war was purely or primarily a war of succession, or that other interests were at play as well that shaped the conflict in an equally or more important manner, such ideologies (religions, secularism, nationalism, liberalism, conservatism), economy, territory and so on. Many wars are not called 'war of succession' because hereditary succession was not the most important element, or despite the fact that it \"was\". Similarly, wars can also be unjustly branded a 'war of succession' whilst the succession was actually not the most important issue hanging in the balance.\n\nThe origins of succession wars lie in feudal or absolutist systems of government, in which the decisions on war and peace could be made by a single sovereign without the population's consent. The politics of the respective rulers was mainly driven by dynastic interests. German historian Johannes Kunisch (1937â2015) ascertained: \"The all-driving power was the dynasties' law of the prestige of power, the expansion of power, and the desire to maintain themselves.\" Moreover, the legal and political coherence of the various provinces of a 'state territory' often consisted merely in nothing more than having a common ruler. Early government systems were therefore based on dynasties, the extinction of which immediately brought on a state crisis. The composition of the governmental institutions of the various provinces and territories also eased their partitioning in case of a conflict, just like the status of claims on individual parts of the country by foreign monarchs.\n\nTo wage a war, a justification is needed (\"Jus ad bellum\"). These arguments may be put forward in a declaration of war, to indicate that one is justly taking up arms. As the Dutch lawyer Hugo Grotius (1583â1645) noted, these must make clear that one is unable to pursue their rightful claims in any other way. The claims to legal titles from the dynastic sphere were a strong reason for war, because international relations primarily consisted of inheritance and marriage policies until the end of the Ancien RÃ©gime. These were often so intertwined that it had to lead to conflict. Treaties that led to hereditary linkages, pawning and transfers, made various relations more complicated, and could be utilised for claims as well. That claims were made at all is due to the permanent struggle for competition and prestige between the respective ruling houses. On top of that came the urge of contemporary princes to achieve \"glory\" for themselves.\n\nAfter numerous familial conflicts, the principle of primogeniture originated in Western Europe the 11th century, spreading to the rest of Europe (with the exception of Russia) in the 12th and 13th century; it has never evolved outside Europe. However, it has not prevented the outbreak of wars of succession. A true deluge of succession wars occurred in Europe between the Thirty Years' War (1618â1648) and the Coalition Wars (1792â1815). According to German historian Heinz Duchhardt (1943) the outbreak of wars of succession in the early modern period was stimulated on the one hand by the uncertainty about the degree to which regulations and agreements on hereditary succession were to be considered a respectable part of emerging international law. On the other hand, there was also a lack of effective means to provide them recognition and validation.\n\nAccording to British statesman Henry Brougham (Lord Chancellor 1830â34), there were more and longer wars of succession in Europe between 1066 and the French Revolution (1789â99) than all other wars put together. \"A war of succession is the most lasting of wars. The hereditary principle keeps it in perpetual life â [whereas] a war of election is always short, and never revives\", he opined, arguing for elective monarchy to solve the problem.\n\nIn the Mughal Empire, there was no tradition of primogeniture. Instead it was customary for sons to overthrow their father, and for brothers to war to the death among themselves.\n\nNote: Wars of succession in transcontinental states are mentioned under the continents where their capital city was located. Names of wars that have been given names by historians are capitalised; the others, whose existence has been proven but not yet given a specific name, are provisionally written in lowercase letters (except for the first word, geographical and personal names).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
