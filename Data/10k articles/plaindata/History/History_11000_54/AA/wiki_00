It began on January 1, 2001, and will end on December 31, 2100. It is the first century of the 3rd millennium. It is distinct from the century known as the 2000s which began on January 1, 2000 and will end on December 31, 2099.\n\nAccording to World Economic Forum, 65% of children entering primary school will end up in jobs or careers that currently do not yet exist.\nAccording to the United Nations World Urbanization prospects, 60% of the world's human population are projected to live in megacities and megalopolises by 2030, and 70% by 2050. By 2040, more than 5 times the current global GDP are expected to be invested in urban infrastructure and its use.\n\nThe first years of the 21st century have thus far been marked by the rise of a global economy and Third World consumerism, mistrust in government, deepening global concern over terrorism and an increase in the power of private enterprise. The Arab Spring of the early 2010s led to mixed outcomes in the Arab world. The Digital Revolution which began around the 1980s also continues into the present. Millennials and Generation Z come of age and rise to prominence in this century.\n\nIn contemporary history, the 21st century essentially began in 1991 (the end of the Short Twentieth Century) with the United States as the sole superpower in the absence of the Soviet Union, while China began its rise and the BRICS countries aimed to create more balance in the global political and economic spectrum.\n\nReligion has been declining worldwide, with an estimated 1.1 billion unaffiliated people in 2010.\n\nThe completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 marks the continual rise of life sciences, making mankind's long-held dreams, such as curing cancer, more realistic. By the 2010s, gene therapy, first performed somatically in late 1990 and heritably in 1996, showed promise but remains an experimental and emerging technology.\n\nAssistive reproductive technology developed in the 1980s, such as polar body biopsy and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, has allowed for the selection of genetic traits, and, along with the advent of ultrasound, has increased the number of boys and decreased the number of girls in many countries, most notably in China and India but also in other Asian and eastern Europe countries. This began in the late 1980s in China and India and after the fall of communism in the Balkans and Caucasus regions, concurrent with both the advent of capitalism in those countries and the widespread availability of reproductive technology.\n\nWhile digital telecommunications technology became widely used by most of the world, concerns about stress from the overuse of mobile phones, the Internet, and related technologies remain controversial.\n\nBy 2013, about 80% of the world's population used mobile phones. An estimated 33% owned personal computers in 2010, and 46% used the Internet by 2016, compared to about 1% in 1996.\n\nThe distribution of modern technology is not equal – in 2012 it was estimated that 1.5 billion people, or about 20% of the world's population still lacked access to electric power, with many more having only intermittent or poor access.\nThe International Energy Agency estimates that 83% of the global population has access to electricity as of 2013 with the percentage projected to increase to 88% by 2030.\n\nThe world population was about 6.1 billion at the start of the 21st century and reached 7.5 billion in 2017. It is estimated to reach about 8.5 billion by the year 2030, and 9.37 billion by the year 2050.\n\nThere is a debate among experts and the general public on how to pronounce specific years of the 21st century in English. Regarding this, academics suggested that since former years such as 1805 and 1905 were commonly pronounced as \"eighteen oh\" or \"nineteen oh\" five, the year 2005 should naturally have been pronounced as \"twenty oh-five\". A less common variation would have been \"twenty nought-five\". Generally, the early years of the 21st century were pronounced as \"two-thousand (and) five\", with a change taking place in 2010, where pronunciations often shift between the early-year standard of \"two-thousand and ten\" and the common approach used in the late 20th century of \"twenty-ten\".\n\nThe Vancouver Olympics, which took place in 2010, was being officially referred to by \"Vancouver 2010\" as \"the twenty-ten Olympics\". The latest timeframes for change are usually placed at 2020.\n\nAccording to The Stanley Kubrick Archives, in the press release for his film \"\", film director Stanley Kubrick included specific instructions for journalists to refer to the movie as \"two thousand and one\" instead of the commonplace pronunciation of \"twenty-oh-one\". Kubrick said he did this in the hope that if the film became popular, it would influence the pronunciation of that year.\n\nGenocide still remains a problem in this century with the concern of the war in Darfur and the growing concern in Sri Lanka. Low estimates on the deaths in Darfur stand around 200,000 deaths with 2.5 million in displacement, there has been much outcry against the perpetrators, the Sudanese government, and the very weak international response. Also, controversies from past genocides remain commonplace in the minds of victims and average people alike.\n\n\n\n\nSome territories have gained independence during the 21st century. This is a list of sovereign states that have gained independence in the 21st century and have been recognized by the UN.\n\nThese territories have declared independence and secured relative autonomy but they have only been recognized by some UN member states:\n\nThese territories have declared independence and secured relative autonomy but they have been recognized by no one:\n\nThese territories were annexed from a sovereign country, the action has only been recognized by some UN member states:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the century began, the generations which had experienced the crises of the mid and the late 20th century (the Great Depression, World War II and the Cold War) as adults, were retiring from leadership positions and public life. Taking their places were members of the postwar \"Boom\" generations, whose formative experiences were the social upheavals (and, in the Western world, relative prosperity) of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nAIDS which emerged in the 1980s continued to spread yet more treatment of AIDS made the disease less of a deadly threat to those with access to treatment. A cure was still not found in the 2000s despite expectations.\n\nSame-sex marriage has slowly become more accepted, and has become legal in some countries. In 2001 the Netherlands became the first nation in the world to legalize this type of marriage. The 2000s decade saw significant change surrounding this social issue and the change has continued into the 2010s.\n\nBy 2001 most Western countries had removed the remaining racial language in their laws.\n\n\nAs of 2009, SIL Ethnologue catalogued 6,909 living human languages. The exact number of known living languages will vary from 5,000 to 10,000, depending generally on the precision of one's definition of \"language\", and in particular on how one classifies dialects.\n\nEstimates vary depending on many factors but the general consensus is that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages currently spoken, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100. The top 20 languages spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with fewer than 10,000 speakers.\n\n2000s\n2010s\n\n\n\n\nAt the start of the 21st century sports are very popular. The IOC's Modern Olympic Games was the most viewed sporting event. Association football is the most popular sport worldwide with the FIFA World Cup the most viewed football event. Other sports such as rugby, cricket, baseball, basketball, ice hockey, tennis, and golf were popular globally. In cricket the emergence of the Twenty20 format as well as the creation of the Indian Premier League led to changes in the nature of the sport. American swimmer Michael Phelps won an Olympic record setting 8 Gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\nModern Olympic Games\n\nAssociation football\n\nAthletics\n\nAquatics\n\nCricket\n\nCycling\n\nRugby Union\n\nTennis (Men)\n\nTennis (Women)\n\nMotorsport\n\nGolf\nBoxing\n\nEntertainment during the 21st century had evolved from the same types of entertainment which emerged around the middle of the 20th century. Sports, films, music, TV series' and books remained popular into the early 21st century but new forms of entertainment including social networking and internet accessed videos became popular. Video games had emerged from a childhood pastime in the late 20th century to an fully grown adult pastime by the beginning of the 21st century. The most popular mediums of entertainment in the first decade at least were televisions, the internet, CDs, DVDs and paper. Digital information begins to complete its succession over analog information and storage techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are several points-of-view pertaining to the following items, all of which should be considered accordingly.\"\n\nIssues that have been frequently discussed and debated so far in this century include:\nThe United Nations lists global issues on its agenda and lists a set of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to attempt to address some of these issues.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He also claims the title of Duke of Ostuni (in the Two Sicilies). The Marquess is author of many books on jurisprudence, royalty, nobility, heraldry and genealogy.\n\nHe is a retired Lieutenant-Commander (Teniente de Navío OF-2) of the Spanish Navy and holds the rank of Captain in the Merchant Marine Fleet. He has also been awarded a doctorate in law, as well as receiving many other orders of knighthood.\n\nThe heraldic office of Spanish King of Arms dates back to the 16th century. Historically heralds were accorded titles of office after Iberian provinces or major cities, whilst the Reyes de armas represented Spanish kingdoms. Accordingly, chroniclers of arms were variously named for España, Castilla, León, Frechas, Sevilla, Córdoba, Murcia, Granada (created in 1496 to honor the reunification of Spain), Bethune, Estella, Viana, Libertat, Blanc Lévrier, Bonne Foy, Las, Gounzcuant, Lamas, Navarra, Cataluña, Sicilia, Aragón, Nápoles, Toledo (depicting Azure an Imperial Crown Or), Valencia and Mallorca. Such appointments were for life (\"ad vitam\") and at least fifteen Spanish families produced more than one herald over the past five hundred years. His role as King of Arms combines that of formally registering pedigrees and the granting of new armorial bearings. In the past the nature of continuous border conflict between the Moorish and Christian kingdoms of medieval Iberia helped to create a sense of ethnic identity, or \"limpieza de sangre\", and heraldry was a significant outlet for expressing national identity; attempts from time to time were made to make arms distinctive of class as well as ethnicity, and the Castilian kings restricted arms to members of the nobility by virtue of Law 64 of the 1583 Cortes de Tudela and was again reiterated by Law 13 of the 1642 Cortes.\n\nCronistas Reyes de Armas are, by custom, appointed by the Spanish Ministry of Justice on behalf of the Casa real, and have authority to grant armorial bearings to subjects of the Spanish Crown as well as being tasked with approving the genealogies of claimants to noble titles. As Cronista de armas de Castilla y León, the marquess continues this tradition being mandated to grant arms and verify family pedigrees.\n\nAlfonso Ceballos-Escallera was married to Ana Moyano y Vital.

He shared the national passion for the archaeology of Israel that also attracts considerable international interest due to the region's biblical links. He is known for his excavations at the most significant biblical site in Israel: south and south west of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. In 1932 he conducted the first archaeological excavation under Jewish auspices in Israel at Beit She'arim (the largest catacombs ever found in Israel) and in 1948 was the first archaeologist to receive a permit granted by the new State of Israel (Tell Qasile, 1948). Mazar was trained as an Assyriologist and was an expert on biblical history, authoring more than 100 publications on the subject. He developed the field of historical geography of Israel. For decades he served as the chairman of the Israel Exploration Society and of the Archaeological Council of Israel (which he founded as the authority responsible for all archaeological excavations and surveys in Israel). Between 1951 and 1977, Mazar served as Professor of Biblical History and Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1952 he became Rector of the University and later its president for eight years commencing in 1953.\n\nHe founded the Hebrew University's new campus at Givat Ram and Hadasah Medical School and Hospital at Ein Karem and led the academic development of the university into one of the leading Universities of the World (see Academic Ranking of World Universities). He was regarded by his students as an inspiring teacher and academic leader and many of these students are now considered leading historians and archaeologists in Israel today.\n\nMazar was born in Ciechanowiec, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. He was educated at Berlin and Giessen universities in Germany. At the age of 23, he emigrated to Mandatory Palestine and in 1943 joined the faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, whose original campus at Mount Scopus was an enclave in the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.\n\nIn 1936 Mazar started the excavations of Beth Shearim, the first archaeological excavation organized by a Jewish institution, and uncovered there the large Jewish catacombs dated to the 2nd-4th centuries CE, known as the burial place of the Jewish leader Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi, the compiler of the Mishnah. In 1948 he was the first archaeologist to receive a permit to dig in the new State of Israel, and explored the Philistine town of Tell Qasile in northern Tel Aviv. He later conducted excavations at Ein Gedi and between 1968 and 1978 directed the excavations south and south-west of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, including an area popularly known as the Ophel, uncovering extensive remains from the Iron Age through the Second Temple period and to Jerusalem's Islamic Period.\n\nIn 1937, Benjamin Mazar revealed at Beit She'arim a system of tombs belonging to the Jews of Ḥimyar (now southern Yemen) dating back to the 3rd century CE. The strength of ties between Yemenite Jewry and the Land of Israel can be learnt, of course, by the system of tombs at Beit She'arim dating back to the 3rd century. It is of great significance that Jews from Ḥimyar were being buried in what was then considered a prestigious place, near the tombs of the Sanhedrin. Those who had the financial means brought their dead to be buried in the Land of Israel, as it was considered an outstanding virtue for Jews not to be buried in foreign lands, but rather in the land of their forefathers. It is speculated that the Ḥimyarites, during their lifetime, were known and respected in the eyes of those who dwelt in the Land of Israel, seeing that one of them, whose name was Menaḥem, was coined the epithet \"qyl ḥmyr\" [prince of Ḥimyar], in the eight-character Ḥimyari ligature, while in the Greek inscription he was called \"Menae presbyteros\" (Menaḥem, the community's elder). The name of a woman in Greek letters, in its genitive form, Ενλογιαζ, was also engraved there, meaning either ‘virtue’, ‘blessing’, or ‘gratis’.\n\nBenjamin Mazar's son Ory Mazar, grandchildren Eilat Mazar and Dan Mazar and nephew Amihai Mazar all played an important role in the study and dissemination of Israeli archaeology and historical knowledge. Eilat Mazar has been a frequent spokesperson for concerns regarding the archaeology of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem while Amihai Mazar was the recipient of the 2009 Israel Prize for Archaeology. Benjamin Mazar is the brother-in-law of Israel's second and only three-term President, Yitzhak Ben Zvi.\n\n\n\n"}

He also discusses Stonehenge, which he believes was also a calendar.\n\nThis structure is known by archaeologists as a medicine wheel dated to 3200 BCE (5200 years ago) by careful stratification of known artifact types. Medicine wheels are constructed by laying stones in a particular pattern on the ground oriented to the four directions. Most medicine wheels follow the basic pattern of having a center of stone, and surrounding that is an outer ring of stones with \"spokes\" (lines of rocks) radiating from the center to the cardinal directions (East, South, West and North).medicine wheels are sited throughout the northern United States and southern Canada, specifically South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\nGordon Freeman challenges their assumption in his book, stating that it is actually a 26 square-kilometer stone calendar that marks the changing seasons better than our modern calendar. Freeman believed that those rocks and rock piles were \"highly engineered,\" and could not be natural. He spent 28 years photographing the site at different times of year and looking for astronomical alignments. He was able to discover that the 28 rays that radiate from the central cairn correspond exactly to the length of a lunar cycle. This assured Freeman that the rocks are not just randomly distributed but were actually precisely placed there for a reason. It has been noted, however, that the author engages in \"speculation that treads close to fiction\", often using conditional phrases \"such as \"perhaps, presumably, seems to be\", and \"might have been\"\".\n\nUnlike Stonehenge which is megalithic, or constructed of extremely large rocks, the Majorville site is constructed of small piles of rocks (cairns) which Freeman says are patterned over an extremely large area. He describes it as a complex, spider-web‐like pattern of stones extending over an area of about thirty square kilometres. He views the hilltop centrepiece of the site as a sunburst image made of stones.\n\nFreeman believed that those rocks and rock piles were \"highly engineered,\" and could not be natural. He spent 28 years photographing the site at different times of year and looking for astronomical alignments.\n\nFreeman argues that the 28 rays of the medicine wheel show that it is a lunar calendar.\n\nUniversity of Alberta archaeologist Jack Ives is cautious about accepting Freeman's ideas. He notes that as the area is an ancient glacial moraine \"[y]ou have to be very careful about what you line up\". However, he did agree that the radial lines \"may certainly reflect solstices and equinoxes. How much more sophisticated beyond that has been a subject of debate\".\n\n"}

Behind this are the rugged hills of the Jebel Dhofar. The western portion of this range is known as the Jebel Qamar, the central part as the Jebel Qara and the eastern part as the Jebel Samhan. From June to September each year, the jebel receives moisture-laden winds (the Khareef or monsoon) and is shrouded in cloud. As a result, it is heavily vegetated, and for much of the year is green and lush. The inhabitants of the villages and communities on the jebel are known as \"jibalis\" (Mountain people). To the north, the hills slope down via rough wadis and cliffs into the gravel plains and sand seas of the Empty Quarter.\n\nIn 1962 a dissatisfied tribal leader, Musallam bin Nufl (Mussalim bin Nafl), formed the Dhofar Liberation Front (DLF) and obtained arms and vehicles from Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia and Oman had earlier clashed over ownership of the Buraimi Oasis, and the Saudis had already supported two failed insurrections in the Jebel Akhdar in the interior of Oman in 1957–59. The DLF also received support from Imam Ghalib Bin Ali, the exiled Imam of Oman, who had led these earlier revolts.\n\nBin Nufl and his men made an epic crossing of the Empty Quarter to reach Dhofar. As early as December 1962, Bin Nufl's guerrilla band performed sabotage operations on the British air base at Salalah and ambushed oil industry vehicles; however, they then withdrew, having been sent by Saudi Arabia to Iraq for more guerrilla training.\n\nFrom 1964 the DLF began a campaign of hit-and-run attacks on oil company installations and government posts. Many of the DLF were trained former soldiers of the Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces (SAF), or of the Trucial Oman Scouts in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe Sultan had relied on the \"Dhofar Force\", a locally recruited irregular unit of only 60 men, to maintain order in the region. In April 1966, members of this unit attempted to assassinate the Sultan. This event apparently changed the nature of the conflict. The Sultan retired to his palace in Salalah, never to be seen in public again. This only served to add to rumours that the British were running Oman through a \"phantom\" Sultan. The Sultan also launched a full-scale military offensive against the DLF, contrary to the advice of his British advisors. Heavy-handed search and destroy missions were launched in Dhofar, villages were burned and wells were concreted over or blown up. A member of the SAF reported that after receiving heavy resistance, it \"proved that the position was unattainable, and after blowing up the village wells we evacuated the camp.\"\n\nFrom the early days of the rebellion, Nasserite and other left wing movements in the neighbouring Aden Protectorate, later the Protectorate of South Arabia, were also involved. In 1967, two events combined to give the Rebellion a more revolutionary complexion. One was the Six-Day War which radicalised opinion throughout the Arab world. The other was the British withdrawal from Aden and the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). From this point, the rebels had a source of arms, supplies and training facilities adjacent to Dhofar, and fresh recruits from groups in the PDRY. Training camps, logistical bases and other facilities were set up in the coastal town of Hawf, only a few miles from the border with Oman.\n\nIn May 1968, an attack by a battalion of the Sultan's Armed Forces against a rebel position at Deefa in the Jebel Qamar was defeated by heavily armed and well-organised and trained rebels.\n\nAt a \"Second Congress\" of the insurgent movement in September 1968, most of the official posts within the movement passed into the hands of radicals, and the movement renamed itself the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf (\"al-Jabha al-Sha'abiya li-Tahrir al-Khalij al-'Arabi al-Muhtall\"), or PFLOAG. The move towards Marxism–Leninism ensured that the PFLOAG received sponsorship from both South Yemen and China. China in particular was quick to support the PFLOAG as it was a peasant-based organisation, giving it a strong Maoist credibility. Chinese support for the PFLOAG also had another benefit for them, as it acted as a counterbalance to increasing Soviet influence in the Indian Ocean. China was quick to establish an embassy in Aden and \"the Yemeni regime allowed its territory to be used for channelling weapons\" to the PFLOAG. Both the Chinese and Soviets also provided members of the PFLOAG with indoctrination and training in unconventional warfare.\n\nThe transformation of the DLF, combined with a new supply of Chinese and Soviet weaponry and better training, ensured that the armed wing of the PFLOAG turned into an effective fighting force. However, it also led to a split between those such as bin Nufl who were fighting mainly for local autonomy and recognition, and the more doctrinaire revolutionaries (led by Mohammad Ahmad al-Ghassani). One of bin Nufl's lieutenants, Said bin Gheer, was an early and influential defector to the Sultan.\n\nNevertheless, by 1969 the DLF and PFLOAG fighters (known widely as \"Adoo\", Arabic for 'enemy') had overrun much of the Jebel Dhofar, and cut the only road across it—that from Salalah to \"Midway\" (Thumrait) in the deserts to the north. They were well-armed with such weapons as the AK-47 assault rifle. They also used heavy machine guns (the DShK), mortars up to 82mm in calibre and 140mm BM-14 or 122mm \"Katyusha\" rockets. By 1970 communists controlled the entire Jebel. Terror was then used to break up the traditional tribal structure. Five elderly sheikhs were pushed over a 450 feet high cliff. Other sheikhs were machine gunned with their sons. Children were forcibly removed from their families and sent to train in Yemen. Young men were sent to train for guerilla warfare in China and Russia.\nThe units of the Sultan's Armed Forces were under strength with only 1,000 men in Dhofar in 1968. They were also badly equipped, mainly with World War II vintage weapons such as bolt-action rifles, which were inferior to the PFLOAG's modern firearms. These rifles were replaced by the FN FAL only late in 1969. Even the SAF's clothing and boots were ragged and unsuitable for the terrain. The units of the SAF were generally not properly trained to face hardy guerrillas on their own ground, and no Omani held a rank above that of Lieutenant (a result of the Sultan's fears of opposition to his rule among the armed forces). The SAF generally were unable to operate in less than company strength on the jebel, and were mainly restricted to Salalah and its immediate area. At various times, small detachments from Nos. 2 (Para), 15 (Field) and 51 (Field) squadrons of the British RAF Regiment, and other units (a Royal Artillery locating troop, a 5.5-inch medium battery of the Royal Jordanian Artillery, and a 25-pounder battery of the Sultan's artillery) had to be deployed to protect the vital airfield at Salalah from infiltrators and from harassing mortar and rocket fire.\n\nOther insurgents in the northern section of Oman formed a separate resistance movement, the National Democratic Front for the Liberation of Oman and the Arabian Gulf (NDFLOAG). In June 1970 they attacked two SAF posts at Nizwa and Izki. They were repulsed but the incident convinced many (including the Sultan's British advisers and backers) that new leadership was required.\n\nIn the 1970 Omani coup d'état on 23 July 1970, Said bin Taimur was deposed and went into exile in London. He was replaced by his son, Qaboos bin Said, who immediately instigated major social, educational and military reforms. Qaboos was well educated, first in Salalah by an old Arab scholar and then at Sandhurst, after which he was commissioned into the Cameronians, a regiment of the British Army. He then completed his education sitting in on councils, attending committee meetings and visiting industry and administrative centres in Britain before returning to Oman. His \"five point plan\" involved:\n\nWithin hours of the coup, British Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers were flown into Oman to further bolster the counterinsurgency campaign. They identified four main strategies that would assist the fight against the PFLOAG:\n\nThe military commanders on the ground (rather than the UK Ministry of Defence) suggested the implementation of a \"hearts and minds\" campaign, which would be put into operation primarily by a troop (25 men) from the SAS. The British government (then under Conservative leader Edward Heath) supported this unconventional approach to the counterinsurgency campaign. It approved the deployment of 20 personnel of the British Royal Engineers, who would aid in the construction of schools and health centres, and drilled wells for the population of Dhofar. Royal Army Medical Corps Field Surgical Teams and some Royal Air Force medical teams would also operate out of Salalah hospital, in order to open a humanitarian front in the conflict. The operation was almost a carbon copy of a system that had proved successful in the Malayan Emergency some twenty years previously. The British government additionally provided monetary support for the creation of the Dhofar Development Programme, whose aim was to wrest support from the PFLOAG through the modernisation of Dhofar.\n\nTo assist in the civil development and coordinate it with the military operations, the command structure in Dhofar was reorganised, with the newly appointed Wāli or civilian governor (Braik bin Hamoud) being given equal status to the military commander of the Dhofar Brigade (Brigadier Jack Fletcher to 1972, Brigadier John Akehurst from that date).\nA major effort was made to counter rebel propaganda and induce the Dhofari population to support the government. In particular, appeals were made to Islam and to traditional tribal values and customs, against the rebels' secular or materialistic teachings. A significant outlet for government propaganda was the many inexpensive Japanese transistor radios which were sold cheaply or distributed free to jibalis who visited Salalah and other government-held towns to sell firewood or vegetables. Although the PFLOAG could also broadcast propaganda by radio, the Government's propaganda was factual and low-key, while that of the rebels, broadcast by Radio Aden, was soon perceived to be exaggerated and stereotyped.\n\nOne step which had a major impact on the uprising was the announcement of an amnesty for surrendered fighters, and aid in defending their communities from rebels. A cash incentive was offered to rebels who changed sides, with a bonus if they brought their weapon. Following the split between the PFLOAG and DLF wings of the rebel movement, several prominent rebel leaders changed sides, including bin Nufl himself and his deputy, Salim Mubarak, who had commanded the eastern region.\n\nThe rebels who defected to the Sultan formed \"Firqat\" irregular units, trained by British Army Training Teams, or BATTs, from the Special Air Service. Salim Mubarak played a major role in establishing the first \"Firqat\" (and the only one to be formed from members of more than one tribe), but died, apparently of heart failure, shortly after its first successful actions. Eighteen \"Firqat\" units, numbering between 50 and 150 men each, were eventually formed. They usually gave themselves names with connections to Islam, such as the \"Firqat Salahadin\" or \"Firqat Khalid bin Walid\". (Some of the PFLOAG units also gave themselves ideological names such as Ho Chi Minh or Che Guevara.) These \"firqat\" irregular groups played a major part in denying local support to the rebels. Being \"jibalis\" themselves (and in many cases with family connections among the communities on the Jebel), they were better at local intelligence-gathering and \"hearts and minds\" activities than the northern Omani or Baluchi personnel of the regular SAF, although they exasperated commanders of the regular SAF by refusing to take part in operations outside their tribal areas, or during Ramadan.\n\nThe first serious step in re-establishing the Sultan's authority on the Jebel took place in October 1971, when Operation Jaguar was mounted, involving five \"Firqat\" units and two squadrons of the SAS. After hard fighting, the SAS and \"Firqats\" secured an enclave on the eastern Jebel Samhan from which they could expand. The SAS introduced two new weapons to support the mobile but lightly equipped \"firqats\": the rapid firing GPMG, which could lay down a heavier weight of fire than the Bren light machine gun previously available to the SAF, and the Browning M2 heavy machine gun, which was deployed to match the DShK machine guns used by the \"adoo\".\n\nMeanwhile, the regular units of the SAF were expanded and re-equipped. Extra officers and NCO instructors from the British Army and Royal Marines (and also the Pakistan Army) were attached to all units (there were nominally twenty-two British or contracted personnel with each infantry battalion) while Omani personnel were educated and trained to become officers and senior NCOs. British specialist elements, including mortar locating radar troops and artillery observation officers, also rotated through Oman over several years.\n\nThe revitalised SAF created fortified lines running north from the coast and up to the summit of the Jebel, to interdict the movement of rebels and the camel trains carrying their supplies from the PDRY. The \"Leopard Line\" was established in 1971, but this line had to be abandoned during the following monsoon season as it could not be supplied. The more effective \"Hornbeam Line\" was set up in 1972, running north from Mughsayl on the coast. The lines consisted of fortified platoon and company outposts on commanding peaks, linked by barbed wire. The posts possessed mortars and some also had artillery, to provide cover for patrols and to harass rebel positions and tracks used by them. The SAF soldiers continually sortied from their outposts to set ambushes on the most likely enemy infiltration routes and mount attacks against rebel mortar- and rocket-launching positions. Anti-personnel land mines were sown on infiltration routes. The rebels also used anti-personnel mines against suspected SAF patrol bases, and even laid anti-tank land mines on tracks used by SAF vehicles.\n\nThe Sultan of Oman's Air Force was also expanded, acquiring BAC Strikemaster aircraft which provided air support to units on the ground, and eight Shorts Skyvan transport aircraft and eight Agusta Bell 205 transport helicopters which supplied \"firqat\" and SAF posts on the jebels. A flight of RAF Westland Wessex helicopters also operated from Salalah.\n\nOn 17 April 1972, a battalion of the SAF made a helicopter landing to capture a position codenamed \"Simba\" at Sarfait near the border with the PDRY. The captured position overlooked the rebels' supply lines along the coastal plain, but did not block them. Although the demands on its transport aircraft and helicopters to maintain the post at Sarfait forced the SAF to abandon some positions in the eastern Jebel, Sarfait was nevertheless retained for four years.\n\nImmediately after China established relations with Iran, all support to the rebels in Dhofar was cut off by China which had changed its mind about insurgencies, since it viewed them as counterproductive to countering the Soviets.\n\nAs a result of the various measures undertaken by the Omani government, \"firqats\" and regular SAF, the rebels were being deprived both of local support and supplies from the PDRY. To retrieve the situation, they mounted a major attack on the coastal town of Mirbat during the monsoon season of 1972. On 19 July 1972, at the Battle of Mirbat, 250 \"adoo\" attacked 100 assorted \"Firqat\" under training, paramilitary \"askars\" (armed police) and a detachment of the Special Air Service. In spite of the low \"khareef\" cloud cover, air support from Strikemaster aircraft was available, and helicopters landed SAS reinforcements. The \"adoo\" were repulsed with heavy losses.\n\nFrom this point on, the rebel defeat was inevitable. In January 1974, after several splits and defections, the rebel movement renamed itself the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman. This public contraction of their aims coincided with a reduction in the support they received from the Soviet Union and China. Meanwhile, the \"adoo\" were steadily cleared from the Jebel Qara and Jebel Samhan by \"firqats\" and were driven into the western part of the Jebel Qamar.\n\nAs a result of Sultan Qaboos's diplomatic initiatives, the Shah of Iran had sent an Iranian Army brigade numbering 1,200 and with its own helicopters to assist the Sultan's Armed Forces in 1973. The Iranian brigade first secured the Salalah-Thumrait road, while their helicopters played a vital role in keeping the isolated \"Simba\" position supplied. In 1974, the Iranian contribution was expanded into the Imperial Iranian Task Force, numbering 4,000. They attempted to establish another interdiction line, codenamed the \"Damavand Line\", running from \"Manston\", a few miles east of Sarfait, to the coast near the border with the PDRY. Heavy opposition from the \"adoo\", which included artillery fire from within the PDRY, thwarted this aim for several months. Eventually, the town of Rahkyut, which the PFLO had long maintained as the capital of their liberated territory, fell to the Iranian task force.\n\nNevertheless, the \"adoo\" kept the respect of their opponents for their resilience and skill. In January 1975, the SAF attempted to capture the main \"adoo\" logistic base in the Shershitti Caves. A SAF company from a battalion which took a wrong route blundered into an ambush in an \"adoo\" \"killing ground\" above the caves and suffered heavy casualties.\nDuring the next few months, the SAF seized an airsrtrip at Deefa, but were unable to make immediate use of it during the \"khareef\". Some regular troops from the PDRY reinforced the \"adoo\", who also deployed SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles for the first time. However, their premature use of this weapon deprived them of the advantage of surprise. Also, the Sultan's Air Force had acquired 31 Hawker Hunter aircraft from the Royal Jordanian Air Force. The SAM-7 was much less effective against these aircraft than against Strikemasters.\n\nIn October 1975, the SAF launched a final offensive. An attack from \"Simba\", intended to be a diversion, nevertheless succeeded in descending cliffs and slopes in total height to reach the coast at Dalqhut, and thus finally cut off the \"adoo\" from their bases in the PDRY. While the Iranian Task Force threatened the Shershitti Caves from the south, another SAF battalion advanced from Deefa, threatening to surround the remaining \"adoo\" territory in the Jebel Qamar. Hawker Hunter aircraft of the Sultan's Air Force attacked artillery positions in the PDRY. Over the next few months, the remaining rebel fighters surrendered or sought sanctuary in the PDRY. The Rebellion was finally declared to be Jebel defeated in January 1976, although isolated incidents took place as late as 1979.\n\nThe port city of Gwadar in Balochistan, Pakistan had been Omani territory until 1958. Baluch troops formed a substantial part of the Sultan's Army. During the rebellion, Oman sought to hire more Baluchi troops. Baluch Students Organization (BSO), a leftist students' organization, expressed solidarity with the Dhofari rebels. In 1979 BSO activist Hameed Baloch tried to shoot at an Omani military officer who was visiting Balochistan to recruit more Baluchi troops. The Omani officer was unhurt, and Baloch was convicted by a Pakistani military court and executed.\n\nAs with many military operations the British were involved in the use of nicknames was commonplace and these were used alongside local names:\n\nThe following were the nicknames of the north south blocking defences in western Dhofar: \n\nThe following are mentioned as operational sites but not yet identified:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "487236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=487236", "title": "Hans Delbrück", "text": "Hans Delbrück\n\nHans Delbrück (11 November 1848 – 14 July 1929) was a German historian. Delbrück was one of the first modern military historians, basing his method of research on the critical examination of ancient sources, and using auxiliary disciplines, like demography and economics, to complete the analysis and the comparison between different epochs to trace the evolution of military institutions.\n\nDelbrück's writings are chiefly concerned with the history of the art of war, his most ambitious work being his \"Geschichte der Kriegskunst im Rahmen der politischen Geschichte\" (History of warfare in the framework of political history, four volumes, third edition published in 1920). Other works are \"Die Perserkriege und die Burgunderkriege\" (The Persian and Burgundian Wars, 1887), \"Die Strategie des Perikles erläutert durch die Strategie Friedrichs des Grossen\" (The strategy of Pericles described through the strategy of Frederick the Great, 1890) and \"Das Leben des Feldmarschalls Grafen Neithardt von Gneisenau\" (Life of Marshal Count Neithardt von Gneisenau, 1894).\n\nDelbrück was born in Bergen on the island of Rügen, and studied at the universities of Heidelberg and Bonn. As a soldier, he fought in the Franco-Prussian War, after which, in 1874, he became for some years tutor to Prince Waldemar of Prussia (1868–1879) of the German imperial family, a brother of the future emperor, Wilhelm II. He served in the Reichstag from 1882 to 1883, and afterward, in 1883, he became an editor of the \"Preussische Jahrbücher\", a noted political magazine. He assumed charge of this publication in 1889, and kept working on it in that capacity until 1920.\n\nIn 1885, he became professor of modern history in the University of Berlin, where his lectures were highly popular. He was a member of the German Reichstag from 1884 to 1890. Delbrück vigorously opposed the policy of the Prussian government in dealing with the Danes and the Poles, with the result that he was twice subjected to disciplinary penalties as a professor and therefore, in Prussia, a civil servant. But it was his main role as editor of \"Preussen Jahrbücher\" that provided a platform for a growing interest in Germany's diplomatic relationship with Russia. This took the form of a roving commission to Herr Paul Rohrbacher to enquire about German opinion. The findings from the 1890s tours formed a racial policy of dismemberment of Russia by seizing Slavic territory that belonged to them. The controversialist Fritz Fischer argued that they were socialists forcing extremists into the hands of revolutionaries. At an early stage of World War I, he became pessimistic regarding the possibility of any real success for Germany except by military and political strategy and tactics of a purely defensive character. He was, on tactical rather than on moral grounds, a strenuous opponent of intensified submarine warfare, and did not conceal his conviction that the result of this method of warfare would ultimately be the intervention of America. He was a member of the German Delegation during the Versailles Peace Conference that ended World War I where he mainly endeavoured to prove that Germany could not be made solely responsible for the outbreak of war. He died in Berlin.\n\nHe was the father of Max Delbrück, who did pioneering work in physics and also won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969.\n\nDelbrück's works tried to place military history in the framework of general history. He regarded warfare as a cultural feature of societies, subject to evolution and influenced by the economy and the political system. His works, however, were not translated into English for some time, hence his reputation among professional military theorists in English-speaking countries is not held in the same esteem or significance as Clausewitz.\n\nSingular conclusions on ancient warfare challenged historiography in so far as he tried to show that the figures for armies in antiquity were inflated in the original sources, and that, contrary to what is stated in most writings, the winner in a battle usually had more troops than the loser. Consequently, he gave completely different interpretations to some of the most famous battles in history, like Marathon, Gaugamela, and Zama by concluding that Rome's vaunted advantage over \"barbarians\" rested, not so much in their discipline and refined tactics, but rather in their superior logistical support. The Romans were able to raise and maintain huge armies on the field, while the \"barbarians\" were unable to match their numbers. The theory aimed to criticize Germany's political class and practice of warfare which were under the heavy sway of nationalistic ideas at the time.\n\nRegarding medieval warfare, Delbrück's findings were more controversial. He made a distinction between knights (mounted warriors) and cavalry (an organized mass of mounted troops), and regarded the medieval warrior as an independent fighter, unable to join others and form units with any decisive tactical significance. Their conclusions were tested by later scholars, in particular the Belgian historian J. F. Verbruggen.\n\nWhen moving into modern warfare, Delbrück showed his intellectual origins in Clausewitz making a distinction between two possible strategies respectively: 'exhausting' the enemy and 'throwing down' the enemy (in German, \"Ermattungsstrategie\" and \"Niederwerfungsstrategie\"; often mistakenly translated as 'attrition' and 'annihilation'). These were derived from Clausewitz's distinctions between strategies seeking limited objectives and strategies aimed at rendering one's opponent militarily helpless, the latter often confused with the concept of \"Total War\" advocated by Ludendorff and rejected by Delbrück during wartime. The choice depended on the nature of the political objectives and existing political and economic limitations, as well as on the correlation of force numbers. He applied this analytical tool to the wars of Frederick the Great, concluding that, due to their numerical inferiority, the Prussians had pursued a strategy of exhaustion. His overall treatment of the era was, however, disappointing, in partially overlooking the Spanish wars. Very critical of his country's strategic thinking he averred it would have been preferable to seek victory in the Eastern front, gain minor objectives on the West and then sue for peace. This was one example of the general principle maintained, that military and political manoeuvres should be integrated.\n\nIn Mel Brooks's comedy \"Young Frankenstein\", Doctor Frankenstein sends his assistant, Igor, to retrieve the brain of Hans Delbrück for transplant into Frankenstein's monster. The tag on the beaker containing the brain reads \"scientist and saint,\" so it is debatable whether Brooks intended the actual historian or a fictional Delbrück.\n\nIn a clearer reference to the historical figure, in Mel Brooks's comedy \"The Producers: The Movie Musical\", Hans Delbrück is the name of the man to whom Franz Liebkind sends a letter by carrier pigeon.\n\nIn Victor Serge’s novel \"Unforgiving Years (Les Années sans pardon)\" the character Herr Schiff—an old German professor loyal to the Nazi regime, demoralized and disoriented in war-ravaged Berlin in the closing days of the Second World War—rereads Hans Delbrück’s \"The History of Warfare\": \"Lately, it was true, the sense of most of what he read escaped him; but being incapable of inattention, the mechanical act of reading acted upon him like a sedative. His cheek cupped in his hand, he reread the works he admired out of duty.\" Hans Delbrück appears in the professor’s thoughts again while contemplating the meaning of the war as American soldiers overtake Berlin: \"The Second World War was already down as a great historical tragedy—a quasi-mythological one—which neither Mommsen, Hans Delbrück, Gobineau, Houston Stewart Chamberlin, Oswald Spengler, or \"Mein Kampf\" could elucidate entirely….\"\n\nOther works of Delbrück, besides those mentioned above, are the following:\n\n\nIn his book \"Regierung und Volkswille\" (1914), Delbrück attempted a defence of the old system of government in Germany and Prussia with particular reference to its \"dualism,\" parliamentary representation and simultaneously a certain degree of autocracy on the part of the sovereign in Prussia and of the federated government in the empire. A succinct statement of Delbrück's views on Germany's responsibility for World War I and an English reply can be found in articles by Delbrück and J. W. Headlam-Morley in the \"Contemporary Review\" (March 1921).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Using Varro's list, subsequent writers defined the seven classical \"liberal arts of the medieval schools\".\n\nThe earliest encyclopedic work to have survived to modern times is the \"Naturalis Historia\" of Pliny the Elder, a Roman statesman living in the 1st century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and all aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77-79, although he probably never finished proofing the work before his death in the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79.\n\nMy subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, many barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor one in which the mind is eager to range: there is not one of us who has made the same venture, nor yet one Greek who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.\n\nHe also elaborates on the difficulties of writing such a work:\n\nIt is a difficult task to give novelty to what is old, authority to what is new, brilliance to the common-place, light to the obscure, attraction to the stale, credibility to the doubtful, but nature to all things and all her properties to nature.\n\nThis work became very popular in Antiquity, and survived, with many copies being made and distributed in the western world. It was one of the first classical manuscripts to be printed in 1470, and has remained popular ever since as a source of information on the Roman world, and especially Roman art, Roman technology and Roman engineering. It is also a recognised source for medicine, art, mineralogy, zoology, botany, geology and many other topics not discussed by other classical authors. Among many interesting entries are those for the elephant and the murex snail, the much sought-after source of Tyrian purple dye.\n\nAlthough his work has been criticized for the lack of candor in checking the \"facts\", some of his text has been confirmed by recent research, like the spectacular remains of Roman gold mines in Spain, especially at Las Médulas, which Pliny probably saw in operation while a Procurator there a few years before he compiled the encyclopedia. Although many of the mining methods are now redundant, such as hushing and fire-setting, it is Pliny who recorded them for posterity, thereby helping us understand their importance in a modern context. Pliny makes clear the fact in the preface to his work that he had checked his facts by reading and comparing the works of others, as well as referring to them by name. Many such books are now lost works and remembered only by his references, much like the lost sources mentioned in the work of Vitruvius a century earlier.\n\nThe work \"De nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae\" (\"About the wedding of Mercury and Philologia\") written by Martianus Capella (4th-5th century) was very influential on the successive medieval encyclopedias. It consists in a complete encyclopedia of classical erudition. It firstly introduced the division and classification of the seven liberal arts (trivium and quadrivium), followed by many successive works along the Middle Ages.\n\nThe first Christian encyclopedia were the \"Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum\" of Cassiodorus (543-560), which were divided in two parts: the first one dealt with Christian Divinity; the second one described the seven liberal arts.\n\nSaint Isidore of Seville, one of the greatest scholars of the early Middle Ages, is widely recognized as being the author of the first known encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the \"Etymologiae\" or \"Origines\" (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and modern. The encyclopedia has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had they not been collected by Saint Isidore.\n\nThe most popular encyclopedia of the Carolingian Age was the \"De universo\" or \"De rerum naturis\" by Rabanus Maurus, written about 830, which was based on \"Etymologiae\".\n\nMany encyclopedic works were written during the 12th and 13th centuries. Among them, \"Hortus deliciarum\" (1167–1185) by Herrad of Landsberg which is thought to be the first encyclopedia written by a woman. \"De proprietatibus rerum\" by Bartholomeus Anglicus (1240) is often described as the most widely read and quoted encyclopedia in the High Middle Ages while Vincent of Beauvais's \"Speculum Majus\" (1260) was the most ambitious encyclopedia in the late-medieval period at over 3 million words.\n\nThe first encyclopedias in vernacular languages were translations or abridgements of works in Latin. Among them, the most famous is \"Li livre dou Trésor\", written in French by the Florentine Brunetto Latini. It is mainly based on the \"Speculum Majus\". The works by the Flemish Jacob van Maerlant, as a whole, are regarded as an encyclopedia. These works, too, are based on former Latin texts.\n\nByzantine encyclopedias were compendia of information about both Ancient and Byzantine Greece. The first of them was the \"Bibliotheca\" written by the patriarch Photius (9th century).\n\nThe \"Suda\" or Souda (Greek: Σοῦδα) is a massive 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world, formerly attributed to an author called Suidas. It is an encyclopedic lexicon, written in Greek, with 30,000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers.\n\nThe early Muslim compilations of knowledge in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the Brethren of Purity of Basra were engaged in their Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity. Notable works include Abu Bakr al-Razi's encyclopedia of science, the Mutazilite Al-Kindi's prolific output of 270 books, and Ibn Sina's medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of universal history (or sociology) from Asharites, al-Tabri, al-Masudi, Tabari's \"History of the Prophets and Kings\", Ibn Rustah, al-Athir, and Ibn Khaldun, whose Muqaddimah contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.\n\nThese scholars have influenced methods of research and editing, due in part to the Islamic practice of isnad which emphasized fidelity to written record, checking sources, and skeptical inquiry. An acquisition of knowledge it was believed not only enlightened the mind but also led to a greater appreciation of God. To be remarkable during these times was to keep pace with the ‘march of intellect’ and the printing press became a necessity for the widespread dissemination of this commodity called knowledge. As a means of cultural production, the printing press was the very embodiment of the ideal of ‘Enlightenment’.\n\nVarāhamihira's (505–587 CE) Brihat Samhita (\"large compilation\") is an encyclopedic work, not only dealing with astrology but also rainfall, clouds, water-divination, intentions and characteristics of animals, perfumes, erotic recipes, pimples, temples, architecture and other topics.\n\nThe enormous encyclopedic work in China of the \"Four Great Books of Song\", compiled by the 11th century during the early Song dynasty (960–1279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the \"Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau\", amounted to 9.4 million Chinese characters in 1,000 written volumes. There were many great encyclopedists throughout Chinese history, including the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) with his \"Dream Pool Essays\" of 1088, the statesman, inventor, and agronomist Wang Zhen (active 1290–1333) with his \"Nong Shu\" of 1313, and the written \"Tiangong Kaiwu\" of Song Yingxing (1587–1666), the latter of whom was termed the \"Diderot of China\" by British historian Joseph Needham.\n\nThe Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty oversaw the compilation of the \"Yongle Encyclopedia\", one of the largest encyclopedias in history, which was completed in 1408 and comprised over 370 million Chinese characters in 11,000 handwritten volumes, of which only about 400 remain today. In the succeeding Qing dynasty, the Qianlong Emperor personally composed 40,000 poems as part of a 4.7 million page library in 4 divisions, including thousands of essays, called the \"Siku Quanshu\" which is probably the largest collection of books in the world. It is instructive to compare his title for this knowledge, \"Watching the waves in a Sacred Sea\" to a Western-style title for all knowledge. Encyclopedic works, both in imitation of Chinese encyclopedias and as independent works of their own origin, have been known to exist in Japan since the 9th century.\n\nThese works were all hand copied and thus rarely available, beyond wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning: they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the creation of printing allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy.\n\nThe \"De expetendis et fugiendis rebus\" by Giorgio Valla was posthumously printed in 1501 by Aldo Manuzio in Venice. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by Archimedes), newly discovered and translated.\n\nThe \"Margarita Philosophica\" by Gregor Reisch, printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the seven liberal arts.\n\nMuch encyclopaedism of the French Renaissance was based upon the notion of not including every fact known to humans, but only that knowledge that was necessary, where necessity was judged by a wide variety of criteria, leading to works of greatly varying sizes. Béroalde de Verville laid the foundation for his encyclopaedic works in a hexameral poem entitled \"Les cognoissances nécessaires\" for example. Often, the criteria had moral bases, such as in the case of Pierre de La Primaudaye's \"L'Académie française\" and Guillaume Telin's \"Bref sommaire des sept vertus &c.\". Encyclopaedists encountered several problems with this approach, including how to decide what to omit as unnecessary, how to structure knowledge that resisted structure (often simply as a consequence of the sheer amount of material that deserved inclusion), and how to cope with the influx of newly discovered knowledge and the effects that it had on prior structures.\n\nThe term encyclopaedia was coined by 15th century humanists who misread copies of their texts of Pliny and Quintilian, and combined the two Greek words \"enkyklios paideia\" into one word. The phrase \"enkyklios paideia\" (ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία) was used by Plutarch and the Latin word Enciclopedia came from him.<br>The first work titled in this way was the \"Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio\" written by Johannes Aventinus in 1517.\n\nThe English physician and philosopher, Sir Thomas Browne, specifically employed the word \"encyclopaedia\" for the first time in English as early as 1646 in the preface to the reader to describe his \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\" or \"Vulgar Errors\", a series of refutations of common errors of his age. Browne structured his encyclopedia upon the time-honoured schemata of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends a hierarchical ladder via the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary and cosmological worlds. Browne's compendium went through no less than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672. \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\" found itself upon the bookshelves of many educated European readers, for throughout the late 17th century and early 18th century it was translated. For many years it was thought incompatible with the French and Dutcheze, into the French, Dutch and German languages as well as Latin.\n\nThe beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, Chambers' \"Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences\" (1728), and the \"Encyclopédie\" of Diderot and D'Alembert (1751 onwards), as well as \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" and the \"Conversations-Lexikon\", were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's \"Lexicon Technicum\" of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content \"A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves\".\n\nJohn Harris is often credited with introducing the now-familiar alphabetic format in 1704 with his English \"Lexicon Technicum: Or, A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves\" – to give its full title. Organized alphabetically, its content does indeed contain explanation not merely of the terms used in the arts and sciences, but of the arts and sciences themselves. Sir Isaac Newton contributed his only published work on chemistry to the second volume of 1710. Its emphasis was on science—and conformably to the broad 18th-century understanding of the term 'science', its content extends beyond what would be called science or technology today, and includes topics from the humanities and fine arts, e.g. a substantial number from law, commerce, music, and heraldry. At about 1,200 pages, its scope can be considered as more that of an encyclopedic dictionary than a true encyclopedia. Harris himself considered it a dictionary; the work is one of the first technical dictionaries in any language.\n\nEphraim Chambers published his \"Cyclopædia\" in 1728. It included a broad scope of subjects, used an alphabetic arrangement, relied on many different contributors and included the innovation of cross-referencing other sections within articles. Chambers has been referred to as the father of the modern encyclopedia for this two-volume work.\n\nA French translation of Chambers' work inspired the \"Encyclopédie\", perhaps the most famous early encyclopedia, notable for its scope, the quality of some contributions, and its political and cultural impact in the years leading up to the French Revolution. The \"Encyclopédie\" was edited by Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Denis Diderot and published in 17 volumes of articles, issued from 1751 to 1765, and 11 volumes of illustrations, issued from 1762 to 1772. Five volumes of supplementary material and a two volume index, supervised by other editors, were issued from 1776 to 1780 by Charles-Joseph Panckoucke.\n\nThe \"Encyclopédie\" represented the essence of the French Enlightenment. The prospectus stated an ambitious goal: the \"Encyclopédie\" was to be a systematic analysis of the \"order and interrelations of human knowledge.\" Diderot, in his \"Encyclopédie\" article of the same name, went further: \"to collect all the knowledge that now lies scattered over the face of the earth, to make known its general structure to the men among we live, and to transmit it to those who will come after us\", to make men not only wiser but also \"more virtuous and more happy.\"\n\nRealizing the inherent problems with the model of knowledge he had created, Diderot's view of his own success in writing the \"Encyclopédie\" were far from ecstatic. Diderot envisioned the perfect encyclopedia as more than the sum of its parts. In his own article on the encyclopedia, Diderot also wrote, \"Were an analytical dictionary of the sciences and arts nothing more than a methodical combination of their elements, I would still ask whom it behooves to fabricate good elements.\" Diderot viewed the ideal encyclopedia as an index of connections. He realized that all knowledge could never be amassed in just one large work, but he hoped the relations among the subjects could be.\n\nThe \"Encyclopédie\" in turn inspired the venerable \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", which had a modest beginning in Scotland: the first edition, issued between 1768 and 1771, had just three hastily completed volumes – A–B, C–L, and M–Z – with a total of 2,391 pages. By 1797, when the third edition was completed, it had been expanded to 18 volumes addressing a full range of topics, with articles contributed by a range of authorities on their subjects.\n\nThe German-language \"Conversations-Lexikon\" was published at Leipzig from 1796 to 1808, in 6 volumes. Paralleling other 18th century encyclopedias, its scope was expanded beyond that of earlier publications, in an effort at comprehensiveness. It was, however, intended not for scholarly use but to provide results of research and discovery in a simple and popular form without extensive detail. This format, a contrast to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", was widely imitated by later 19th century encyclopedias in Britain, the United States, France, Spain, Italy and other countries. Of the influential late-18th century and early-19th century encyclopedias, the \"Conversations-Lexikon\" is perhaps most similar in form to today's encyclopedias.\nThe early years of the 19th century saw a flowering of encyclopedia publishing in the United Kingdom, Europe and America. In England \"Rees's Cyclopædia\" (1802–19) contains an enormous amount in information about the industrial and scientific revolutions of the time. A feature of these publications is the high-quality illustrations made by engravers like Wilson Lowry of art work supplied by specialist draftsmen like John Farey, Jr. Encyclopedias were published in Scotland, as a result of the Scottish Enlightenment, for education there was of a higher standard than in the rest of the United Kingdom. The National Revival of Bulgaria, influenced by the Enlightenment, resulted in Petar Beron's \"Primer with Various Instructions\" (also known as the \"Fish Primer\") in 1824. It was a small encyclopedia for children, containing fables, proverbs, ancient history, basic arithmetics, zoology and linguistics. Beron later published a 7-volume work in natural sciences known as \"Panepisteme\" in 1867.\n\nThe 17-volume \"Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle\" and its supplements were published in France by Pierre Larousse from 1866 to 1890.\n\n\"Encyclopædia Britannica\" appeared in various editions throughout the century, and the growth of popular education and the Mechanics' Institutes, spearheaded by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge led to the production of the \"Penny Cyclopaedia\", as its title suggests issued in weekly numbers at a penny each like a newspaper.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" reached its eleventh edition, and inexpensive encyclopedias such as \"Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia\" and \"Everyman's Encyclopaedia\" were common.\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th century, many smaller or less developed languages saw their first encyclopedias, using French, German, and English role models. While encyclopedias in larger languages, having large markets that could support a large editorial staff, churned out new 20-volume works in a few years and new editions with brief intervals, such publication plans often spanned a decade or more in smaller languages.\n\nThe first large encyclopedia in Russian, \"Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary\" (86 volumes, 1890–1906), was a direct cooperation with the German Brockhaus.\n\nWithout such a formal cooperation, the Swedish \"Conversations-lexicon\" (4 volumes, 1821–1826) was a translation of Brockhaus 2nd edition. The first encyclopedia written originally in Swedish was \"Svenskt konversationslexikon\" (4 volumes, 1845–1851) by Per Gustaf Berg. A more ambitious project was \"Nordisk familjebok\", established in 1875 and intended to comprise 6 volumes. But in 1885, when it had published 8 volumes and gotten only halfways (A–K), the publisher turned to the government for extra funding; encyclopedias had become national monuments. It was finished in 1894 with 18 volumes, with two supplement volumes (1896–1899).\n\nThe first major Danish encyclopedia was \"Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon\" (19 volumes, 1893–1911).\n\nIn Norway, encyclopedias follow the unique history of the Norwegian language, the Bokmål variant having branched off from Danish during the 19th century. After the national independence in 1905, publisher Aschehoug (owned by William Martin Nygaard) hired librarian Haakon Nyhuus to edit \"Illustreret norsk konversationsleksikon\" (6 volumes, 1907–1913), in later editions known as \"Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon\". In the Nynorsk variant of the language, \"Norsk Allkunnebok\" (10 volumes, 1948–1966) was the only encyclopedia until the arrival of Wikipedia.\n\nThe first major Finnish encyclopedia was \"Tietosanakirja\" (11 volumes, 1909–1922). Inspired by the minority language example of \"Norsk Allkunnebok\", a Swedish-language encyclopedia of Finland was initiated in 1969 and eventually published as \"Uppslagsverket Finland\" (3 volumes, 1982–1985; 2nd edition in 5 volumes, 2003–2007). With such a small market, the sales revenue only covered the printing cost, while editors were paid by endowments. In 2009 the entire contents was made available online, free of charge.\n\nAlready during czarist Russian rule, two editions appeared of the Latvian \"Konversācijas vārdnīca\" (2 volumes, 1891–1893; 4 volumes, 1906–1921). The larger \"Latviešu konversācijas vārdnīca\" (21 volumes, A–Tjepolo, 1927–1940) was interrupted by World War II and never completed. After the war, Latvian emigrants in Sweden published \"Latvju enciklopēdija\" (3 volumes, 1950–1956, with a supplement volume in 1962). Soviet authories published \"Latvijas PSR mazās enciklopēdijas\" (3 volumes, 1967–1970) and \"Latvijas padomju enciklopēdija\" (10 volumes, 1981–1988).\n\nSimilarly, in the history of Lithuanian encyclopedias, the \"Lietuviškoji enciklopedija\" (9 volumes A–J, 1933–1941) was interrupted by World War II and never completed. Lithuanian emigrants in the United States published \"Lietuvių enciklopedija\" (35 volumes, 1953–1966). Soviet authorities published \"Mažoji lietuviškoji tarybinė enciklopedija\" (3 volumes, 1966–1971), \"Lietuviškoji tarybinė enciklopedija\" (12 volumes, 1976–1985), and \"Tarybų Lietuvos enciklopedija\" (4 volumes, 1985–1988).\nFirst Turkish encyclopedia was Kamus-ül-Ulûm ve’l-Maarif written by Ali Suvai in 1870 after that Ahmet Rifat Efendi's 7 volumes work \"Lûgaat-i Tarihiye ve Coğrafiye\" (Dictionary of History and Geography) published in Istanbul at 1881.\n\nPopular and affordable encyclopedias such as \"Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia\" and \"The Children's Encyclopædia\" appeared in the early 1920s.\n\nIn the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were \"World Book Encyclopedia\" and \"Funk & Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia\".\n\nThe second half of the 20th century also saw the publication of several encyclopedias that were notable for synthesizing important topics in specific fields, often by means of new works authored by significant researchers. Such encyclopedias included \"The Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" (first published in 1967 and now in its second edition), and \"Elsevier's Handbooks In Economics\" series. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size exist for most if not all academic disciplines, including, typically, such narrow topics such as bioethics and African-American history.\n\nBy the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on CD-ROMs for use with personal computers. Microsoft's \"Encarta\", launched in 1993, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images. After sixteen years, Microsoft discontinued the Encarta line of products in 2009.\n\nTraditional encyclopedias are written by a number of employed text writers, usually people with an academic degree, and distributed as proprietary content.\n\nEncyclopedias are essentially derivative from what has gone before, and particularly in the 19th century, copyright infringement was common among encyclopedia editors. However, modern encyclopedias are not merely larger compendia, including all that came before them. To make space for modern topics, valuable material of historic use regularly had to be discarded, at least before the advent of digital encyclopedias. Moreover, the opinions and world views of a particular generation can be observed in the encyclopedic writing of the time. For these reasons, old encyclopedias are a useful source of historical information, especially for a record of changes in science and technology.\n\nAs of 2007, old encyclopedias whose copyright has expired, such as the 1911 edition of \"Britannica\", are also the only free content English encyclopedias released in print form. However, works such as the \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\", which were created in the public domain, exist as free content encyclopedias in other languages.\n\nThe concept of a new free encyclopedia began with the Interpedia proposal on Usenet in 1993, which outlined an Internet-based online encyclopedia to which anyone could submit content and that would be freely accessible. Early projects in this vein included Everything2 and Open Site. In 1999, Richard Stallman proposed the GNUPedia, an online encyclopedia which, similar to the GNU operating system, would be a \"generic\" resource. The concept was very similar to Interpedia, but more in line with Stallman's GNU philosophy.\n\nIt was not until Nupedia and later Wikipedia that a stable free encyclopedia project was able to be established on the Internet.\n\nThe English Wikipedia, which was started in 2001, became the world's largest encyclopedia in 2004 at the 300,000 article stage and by late 2005, Wikipedia had produced over two million articles in more than 80 languages with content licensed under the copyleft GNU Free Documentation License. As of August 2009, Wikipedia had over 3 million articles in English and well over 10 million combined in over 250 languages. Wikipedia currently has articles in English. Since 2003, other free encyclopedias like the Chinese-language Baidu Baike and Hudong, as well as English language encyclopedias like Citizendium and Knol have appeared. Knol has been discontinued.\n\nAn encyclopedia's hierarchical structure and evolving nature is particularly adaptable to a digital format, and all major printed general encyclopedias had moved to this method of delivery by the end of the 20th century. Disk-based, typically DVD-ROM or CD-ROM format, publications have the advantage of being cheaply produced and easily portable. Additionally, they can include media which are impossible to store in the printed format, such as animations, audio and video. Hyperlinking between conceptually related items is also a significant benefit, although even Diderot's encyclopedia had cross-referencing.\n\nOn-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being dynamic: new information can be presented almost immediately, rather than waiting for the next release of a static format, as with a disk- or paper-based publication. Many printed encyclopedias traditionally published annual supplemental volumes (\"yearbooks\") to update events between editions, as a partial solution to the problem of staying up-to-date, but this of course required the reader to check both the main volumes and the supplemental volumes. Some disk-based encyclopedias offer subscription-based access to online updates, which are then integrated with the content already on the user's hard disk in a manner not possible with a printed encyclopedia.\n\nInformation in a printed encyclopedia necessarily needs some form of hierarchical structure. Traditionally, the method employed is to present the information ordered alphabetically by the article title. However, with the advent of dynamic electronic formats the need to impose a pre-determined structure is less necessary. Nonetheless, most electronic encyclopedias still offer a range of organizational strategies for the articles, such as by subject, area, or alphabetically.\n\nDigital encyclopedias also offer greater search abilities than printed versions. While the printed versions rely on indexes to assist in searching for topics, computer accessible versions allow searching through article text for keywords or phrases.\n\nSpecialized encyclopedias may offer a more comprehensive content. For example, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ADAM Medical Encyclopedia (which includes over 4,000 articles about diseases, tests, symptoms, injuries, and surgeries), the Wiki Encyclopedia of Law and the Encyclopedia of Earth all provide a more focused list of topics.\n\nIn the Islamic Republic of Iran, recent works include the \"Encyclopaedia of the World of Islam\" prepared in 10 volumes by The Encyclopaedia Islamica Foundation, the \"Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Islam\" published as a four-volume English encyclopedia including around 1200 entries. Other such works are: the \"Encyclopedia of Imam Ali\", the \"Encyclopedia of Qur'anology\", and the \"Encyclopedia of Lady Fātima\", all published by the Islamic Research Institute for Culture and Thought (IICT).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30497319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30497319", "title": "Irwin Abrams", "text": "Irwin Abrams\n\nIrwin Martin Abrams (February 24, 1914 – December 16, 2010) was a long-time professor of history at Antioch College, a pioneer in the field of peace research, and a global authority on the Nobel Peace Prize. His book, \"The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates\", first published in 1988 and subsequently updated and revised, is regarded as the authoritative reference work on the subject. His other books included \"Words of Peace\", which brought together selections from the acceptance speeches of Nobel Peace Prize laureates, and five volumes of \"Nobel Lectures in Peace\".\n\nIrwin Abrams was born in San Francisco in 1914. He graduated from Lowell High School in December 1930 at the age of 16. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree from Stanford University and a master's degree and Ph.D. from Harvard University. In 1936-37, he traveled to Europe to do research for his dissertation. It was a formative experience. He met many outstanding leaders and scholars of the international peace movement and delved into previously unknown source materials.\n\n\"Abrams opened and explored archival sources on which a generation of historians would come to depend,\" the Magazine of History said in a 1994 profile. \"His dissertation, A History of European Peace Societies, 1867-1899, won the Charles Sumner Peace Prize and, although it was never published, it has been called 'the most quoted unpublished dissertation in history'. Whether or not that is factual, it has the ring of truth, for Abrams's 1938 work and his subsequent writing gave direction and inspiration to historians on both sides of the Atlantic when the study of peace in history blossomed a generation later.\"\n\nBorn Jewish, Abrams became a Quaker in the late 1930s, inspired in part by his research on the early peace movement and his friendships with British philosopher Gerald Heard and others. He later wrote that joining the Society of Friends was the final step in a move away from liberal humanism toward the ideal of pacifism and nonviolence. He came to believe that \"to change the world you had to change yourself.\" \n\nDuring World War II, Abrams fulfilled his obligations as a conscientious objector by working with the American Friends Service Committee, or AFSC, in Philadelphia. He researched international relief work, directed training for AFSC relief workers from 1943 to 1946 and organized the Quaker International Workcamp Program the following year. During that time, his wife Freda, whom he had married in 1939, stayed home with their two young children, David and Carole. A third child, James, was born a few years later.\n\nThe family moved to Yellow Springs, Ohio, in 1947 when Abrams joined the faculty of Antioch College. He organized the Department of History and created an introduction to western civilization still fondly remembered by many Antioch alumni. He became a full professor in 1951, Distinguished University Professor in 1979, and \"emeritus\" two years later.\n\nThroughout his Antioch years, Abrams was nudged beyond the classroom by his Quaker concern for peace, his pioneering studies of the historic European peace movement and his own international experience. He became, as he wrote, \"a theorist and practitioner\" in study abroad and intercultural experience. The number of international exchanges, including study abroad, was rising rapidly, and he saw this as a valuable opportunity to encourage cross-cultural understanding.\n\nAfter his retirement from teaching, Abrams published the first of several books on the Nobel Peace Prize. His \"The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates: An Illustrated Biographical History\" was published in 1989. It was recognized as an \"outstanding reference work\" by the American Library Association. He went on to publish other works on the prize, including \"Words of Peace\", which brings together selections from the acceptance speeches of the prizewinners, and five volumes of \"Nobel Lectures in Peace\".\n\nOf writing about the laureates, he wrote, \"It's been a rich experience to live with these people all of these years.\" He met many of the prizewinners, including the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, Willy Brandt and Martin Luther King, Jr. Another laureate, José Ramos-Horta, the current president of East Timor, considered him a friend. Abrams \"led a life of scholarly integrity, intellectual and moral rectitude, compassion and faith in humanity, encompassing a whole century of profound transformation in the history of our small world\", he said.\n\nAbrams was honored on numerous occasions by colleagues and former students. In 1997, he received an honorary doctorate from Antioch University. In 2000, he was given a distinguished lifetime service award by the Peace History Society and the Peace History Commission of the International Peace Research Association.\n\nIn 2003, the Antioch College Alumni Association presented him with the Arthur Morgan Award \"for his long and exemplary service to the Antioch College community, the education community and the global community\".\n\nAbrams said that the happiest outcome of his teaching years was when his students from the class of 1955 came together in 2005 – 50 years later – and raised funds for a peace education memorial fund in his name.\n\nHe was inducted into the \"Walk of Fame\" in Dayton, Ohio, in the fall of 2007 and has a square on the sidewalk on W. Third Street in Dayton commemorating his achievements. The inscription states that \"Dr. Abrams brought recognition to Antioch University\" as a \"scholar, author, educator and humanitarian.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "86346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86346", "title": "James Naismith", "text": "James Naismith\n\nJames Naismith (November 6, 1861 – November 28, 1939) was a Canadian-American physical educator, physician, chaplain, sports coach and innovator. He invented the game of basketball at age 30 in 1891. He wrote the original basketball rule book and founded the University of Kansas basketball program. Naismith lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and as an official event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, as well as the birth of the National Invitation Tournament (1938) and the NCAA Tournament (1939).\n\nBorn in Canada, Naismith studied physical education at McGill University in Montreal before moving to the United States, where he designed the game in late 1891 while teaching at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Seven years after inventing basketball, Naismith received his medical degree in Denver in 1898. He then arrived at the University of Kansas, later becoming the Kansas Jayhawks' athletic director and coach. While a coach at Kansas, Naismith coached Phog Allen, who later became the coach at Kansas for 39 seasons, beginning a lengthy and prestigious coaching tree. Allen then went on to coach legends including Adolph Rupp and Dean Smith, among others, who themselves coached many notable players and future coaches. Despite coaching his final season in 1907, Naismith is still the only coach in Kansas men's basketball history with a losing record.\n\nNaismith was born on November 6, 1861 in Almonte, Canada West (now part of Mississippi Mills, Ontario, Canada) to Scottish immigrants. He never had a middle name and never signed his name with the \"A\" initial. The \"A\" was added by someone in the administration at the University of Kansas.\n\nStruggling in school but gifted in farm labour, Naismith spent his days outside playing catch, hide-and-seek, or duck on a rock, a medieval game in which a person guards a large drake stone from opposing players, who try to knock it down by throwing smaller stones at it. To play \"duck on a rock\" most effectively, Naismith soon found that a soft lobbing shot was far more effective than a straight hard throw, a thought that later proved essential for the invention of basketball. Orphaned early in his life, Naismith lived with his aunt and uncle for many years and attended grade school at Bennies Corners near Almonte. Then he enrolled in Almonte High School, in Almonte, Ontario, from which he graduated in 1883.\n\nIn the same year, Naismith entered McGill University in Montreal. Although described as a slight figure, standing 5 foot 10 ½ and listed at 178 pounds, he was a talented and versatile athlete, representing McGill in Canadian football, lacrosse, rugby, soccer and gymnastics. He played centre on the football team, and made himself some padding to protect his ears. It was for personal use, not team use. He won multiple Wicksteed medals for outstanding gymnastics performances. Naismith earned a BA in Physical Education (1888) and a Diploma at the Presbyterian College in Montreal (1890). From 1891 on, Naismith taught physical education and became the first McGill director of athletics, but then left Montreal to become a physical education teacher at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nSpringfield college: Invention of Basketball\nAt the Springfield YMCA, Naismith struggled with a rowdy class that was confined to indoor games throughout the harsh New England winter and thus was perpetually short-tempered. Under orders from Dr. Luther Gulick, head of Physical Education there, Naismith was given 14 days to create an indoor game that would provide an \"athletic distraction\": Gulick demanded that it would not take up much room, could help its track athletes to keep in shape and explicitly emphasized to \"make it fair for all players and not too rough.\"\n\nIn his attempt to think up a new game, Naismith was guided by three main thoughts. Firstly, he analyzed the most popular games of those times (rugby, lacrosse, soccer, football, hockey, and baseball); Naismith noticed the hazards of a ball and concluded that the big soft soccer ball was safest. Secondly, he saw that most physical contact occurred while running with the ball, dribbling or hitting it, so he decided that passing was the only legal option. Finally, Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal unguardable, namely placing it high above the player's heads. To score goals, he forced the players to throw a soft lobbing shot that had proven effective in his old favorite game \"duck on a rock\". Naismith christened this new game \"Basket Ball\" and put his thoughts together in 13 basic rules.\n\nThe first game of \"Basket Ball\" was played in December 1891. In a handwritten report, Naismith described the circumstances of the inaugural match; in contrast to modern basketball, the players played nine versus nine, handled a soccer ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: \"When Mr. Stubbins brot up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them on the inside of the railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules on the bulletin board just behind the instructor's platform, secured a soccer ball and awaited the arrival of the class ... The class did not show much enthusiasm but followed my lead ... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men & tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon.\" In contrast to modern basketball, the original rules did not include what is known today as the dribble. Since the ball could only be moved up the court via a pass early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court. Also following each \"goal\" a jump ball was taken in the middle of the court. Both practices are obsolete in the rules of modern basketball.\n\nIn a radio interview in January 1939, Naismith gave more details of the first game and the initial rules that were used:\n\nI showed them two peach baskets I'd nailed up at each end of the gym, and I told them the idea was to throw the ball into the opposing team's peach basket. I blew a whistle, and the first game of basketball began. ... The boys began tackling, kicking and punching in the clinches. They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor. [The injury toll: several black eyes, one separated shoulder and one player knocked unconscious.] \"It certainly was murder.\" [Naismith changed some of the rules as part of his quest to develop a clean sport.] The most important one was that there should be no running with the ball. That stopped tackling and slugging. We tried out the game with those [new] rules (fouls), and we didn't have one casualty.\n\nBy 1892, basketball had grown so popular on campus that Dennis Horkenbach (editor-in-chief of \"The Triangle\", the Springfield college newspaper) featured it in an article called \"A New Game\", and there were calls to call this new game \"Naismith Ball\", but Naismith refused. By 1893, basketball was introduced internationally by the YMCA movement. From Springfield, Naismith went to Denver where he acquired a medical degree and in 1898 he joined the University of Kansas faculty at Lawrence, Kansas.\n\nThe family of Lambert G. Will has claimed that Dr. Naismith borrowed components for the game of basketball from Will to dispute Naismith's sole creation of the game, citing alleged photos and letters.\n\nThe University of Kansas men's basketball program officially began following Naismith's arrival in 1898, which was six years after Naismith drafted the sport's first official rules. Naismith was not initially hired to coach basketball, but rather as a chapel director and physical education instructor. In those early days, the majority of the basketball games were played against nearby YMCA teams, with YMCAs across the nation having played an integral part in the birth of basketball. Other common opponents were Haskell Indian Nations University and William Jewell College. Under Naismith, the team played only one current Big 12 school: Kansas State (once). Naismith was, ironically, the only coach in the program's history to have a losing record (55–60). However, Naismith coached Forrest \"Phog\" Allen, his eventual successor at Kansas, who went on to join his mentor in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. When Allen became a coach himself and told him that he was going to coach basketball at Baker University in 1904, Naismith discouraged him: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\" Instead, Allen embarked on a coaching career that would lead him to be known as \"the Father of Basketball Coaching.\" During his time at Kansas, Allen coached Dean Smith (1952 National Championship team) and Adolph Rupp (1922 Helms Foundation National Championship team). Smith and Rupp have joined Naismith and Allen as members of the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nBy the turn of the century, there were enough college teams in the East that the first intercollegiate competitions could be played out. Although the sport continued to grow, Naismith long regarded the game as a curiosity and preferred gymnastics and wrestling as better forms of physical activity. However, basketball became a demonstration sport at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis. As the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame reports, Naismith was also neither interested in self-promotion nor in the glory of competitive sports. Instead, he was more interested in his physical education career, receiving an honorary PE Masters degree in 1910, patrolled the Mexican border for four months in 1916, traveled to France, published two books (\"A Modern College\" in 1911 and \"Essence of a Healthy Life\" in 1918). He took American citizenship in 1925. In 1909, Naismith's duties at Kansas were redefined as a Professorship; he served as the \"de facto\" athletic director at Kansas for much of the early 20th century.\n\nIn 1923, Dr. Naismith was a founder of the Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity at the University of Kansas. Naismith was deeply involved with the members, serving as Chapter Counselor for sixteen years, from 1923 until his death in 1939. He eventually married SigEp's Housemother, Mrs. Florence Kincaid. Members interviewed from that era remembered Dr. Naismith: \"He was deeply religious\" \"He listened more than he spoke\" \"He thought sports were nothing but an avenue to keep young people involved so they could do their studies and relate to their community\" \"It was real nice having someone the caliber of Dr. Naismith so involved ... he helped many a SigEp!\"\n\nIn 1935, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (created by Naismith's pupil Phog Allen) collected money so that the 74-year-old Naismith could witness the introduction of basketball into the official Olympic sports program of the 1936 Summer Olympic Games. There, Naismith handed out the medals to three North American teams: United States, for the gold medal, Canada, for the silver medal, and Mexico, for their bronze medal win. During the Olympics, he was named the honorary president of the International Basketball Federation. When Naismith returned he commented that seeing the game played by many nations was the greatest compensation he could have received for his invention. In 1937, Naismith played a role in the formation of the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball, which later became the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA).\n\nNaismith became professor emeritus in Kansas when he retired in 1937 at the age of 76. Including his years as coach, Naismith served as athletic director and faculty at the school for a total of almost 40 years. Naismith died in 1939 after he suffered a fatal brain hemorrhage. He was interred at Memorial Park Cemetery in Lawrence, Kansas. His masterwork \"Basketball — its Origins and Development\" was published posthumously in 1941. In Lawrence, Kansas, James Naismith has a road named in his honor, Naismith Drive, which runs in front of Allen Fieldhouse (the official address of Allen Fieldhouse is 1651 Naismith Drive), the university's basketball facility. The university also named the court in Allen Fieldhouse \"James Naismith Court\" in his honor, despite Naismith having the worst record in school history. Naismith Hall, a college residential dormitory, is located on the northeastern edge of 19th Street and Naismith Drive.\n\nIn 1898, Naismith became the first basketball coach of the University of Kansas. He compiled a record of 55–60 and is ironically the only losing coach in Kansas history. Naismith is at the beginning of a massive and prestigious coaching tree, as he coached Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach Phog Allen, who himself coached Hall of Fame coaches Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp, and Ralph Miller who all coached future coaches as well.\n\nNaismith invented the game of basketball and wrote the original 13 rules of this sport as opposed to the NBA rule book which features 66 pages. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts is named in his honor, and he was an inaugural inductee in 1959. The National Collegiate Athletic Association rewards its best players and coaches annually with the Naismith Awards, among them the Naismith College Player of the Year, the Naismith College Coach of the Year and the Naismith Prep Player of the Year. After the Olympic introduction to men's basketball in 1936, women's basketball became an Olympic event in Montreal during the 1976 Summer Olympics. Naismith was also inducted into the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame, the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame, the McGill University Sports Hall of Fame, the Kansas State Sports Hall of Fame, FIBA Hall of Fame, and The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which was named in his honor. The FIBA Basketball World Cup trophy is named the \"James Naismith Trophy\" in his honour. On June 21, 2013, Dr. Naismith was inducted into the Kansas Hall of Fame during ceremonies in Topeka.\n\nNaismith's home town of Almonte, Ontario, hosts an annual 3-on-3 tournament for all ages and skill levels in his honor. Every year this event attracts hundreds of participants and involves over 20 half court games along the main street of the town. All proceeds of the event go to youth basketball programs in the area.\n\nBasketball today is played by more than 300 million people worldwide, making it one of the most popular team sports. In North America, basketball has produced some of the most-admired athletes of the 20th century. ESPN and the Associated Press both conducted polls to name the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century. Basketball player Michael Jordan came in first in the ESPN poll and second (behind Babe Ruth) in the AP poll. Both polls featured fellow basketball players Wilt Chamberlain (of KU, like Naismith) and Bill Russell in the Top 20.\n\nThe original rules of basketball written by James Naismith in 1891, considered to be basketball's founding document, was auctioned at Sotheby's, New York in December, 2010. Josh Swade, a University of Kansas alumnus and basketball enthusiast, went on a crusade in 2010 to persuade moneyed alumni to considering bidding on and hopefully winning the document at auction to gift it to the University of Kansas. Swade eventually persuaded David G. Booth, a billionaire investment banker and KU alumnus, and his wife Suzanne Booth to commit to bidding at the auction. The Booths won the bidding and purchased the document for a record $4,338,500 USD, the most ever paid for a sports memorabilia item, and gifted the document to the University of Kansas. Swade's project and eventual success are chronicled in a 2012 ESPN 30 for 30 documentary \"There's No Place Like Home\" and in a corresponding book, \"The Holy Grail of Hoops: One Fan's Quest to Buy the Original Rules of Basketball\". The University of Kansas constructed an $18 million building named the Debruce Center, which houses the rules and opened in March 2016.\n\nJames Naismith was the second child of Margaret and John Naismith, two Scottish immigrants. His mother, Margaret Young, was born in 1833 and immigrated to Lanark County, Canada in 1852 as the fourth of 11 children. His father, John Naismith, was born in 1833, left Europe when he was 18, and also settled down in Lanark County. On June 20, 1894, Naismith married Maude Evelyn Sherman (1870–1937) in Springfield, MA, USA. The couple had five children: Margaret Mason (Stanley) (1895–1976), Helen Carolyn (Dodd) (1897–1980), John Edwin (1900–1986), Maude Ann (Dawe) (1904–1972) and James Sherman (1913–1980). He was a member of the Pi Gamma Mu and Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternities. Naismith was a Presbyterian minister, and was also remembered as a Freemason. Maude Naismith died in 1937, and on June 11, 1939, he married his second wife Florence B. Kincaid. On November 19 of that year, Naismith suffered a major brain hemorrhage and died nine days later in his home located in Lawrence, Kansas. Naismith was 78 years old. Coincidentally, Naismith died eight months after the birth of the NCAA Basketball Championship, which today has evolved to one of the biggest sports events in North America. Naismith is buried with his first wife in Memorial Park Cemetery in Lawrence, Kansas. Florence Kincaid died in 1977 at the age of 98 and is buried with her first husband, Dr. Frank B. Kincaid, in Elmwood Cemetery in Beloit, Kansas.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Naismith held the following education and academic positions:\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nFurther reading\n\n\n \n"}

He passed his law examination but never practiced the legal profession, having decided to enter on a literary career.\nHe soon left his native city and settled in Paris, where he opened a bookstore and at the same time was active with his pen. He died in Paris on 21 February 1851.\n\nHis first publications, concerning the French Revolution, Napoleon and the Bourbon Restoration, were \"La lanterne magique\" (1811); \"Blanc, bleu et rouge\" (1814) and a \"Tableau historique des événements qui se sont accomplis depuis le retour de Bonaparte jusqu'au rétablissement de Louis XVII\" (1815). He contributed to the \"Journal de Lyon\" founded by Pierre-Simon Ballanche.\n\nOnce in Paris, he first published articles of a political cast, and historical tales in the style of the time, such as \"Michel Morin et la Ligue\"; \"Florence ou la Religieuse\"; \"Le Régicide\" and others.\nHe then took up historical writing, his first work of this kind being \"Le Concordat entre Léon X et François I\" (1821), which is for the most part a translation of the Concordat between pope Leo X and renaissance king Francis I of France. This was followed by his \"Histoire de la St. Barthélemy\" (2 volumes, 1826) on the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 24 August 1572. These two works were fairly well received although some ecclesiastical critics accused him of being too favorable to the Protestants. Audin publicly defended himself against this imputation, and asserted his firm belief in the doctrines of the Catholic Church.\nHe now began his most important work, the history of the Protestant Reformation, which he published from 1839 to 1842 in four books, as follows: # \"Histoire de la vie, des ouvrages et de la doctrine de Luther\" (2 volumes, Paris, 1839; 2d ed., 3 volumes, 1850) on Martin Luther\nThe author claims to have based his statements upon researches which he made in the archives of various European cities, especially in the archives of the Vatican. The work shows that this assertion cannot be accepted in its entirety. The volumes are written in a romantic manner, and contain many particulars which sober criticism has long proved to go false. Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger said of the work on Luther: \"Audin's work is written with an extraordinary, and at times almost naive ignorance of Luther's writings and contemporary literature, and of the general condition of Germany at that period\" (Kirchenlexikon, s.v. Luther).\n\n"}

It is designed such that someone with a normal mechanical ability would be able to construct it before or during a nuclear attack, using common household items.\n\nThe Kearny fallout meter was developed by Cresson Kearny from research performed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and published in the civil defense manual \"Nuclear War Survival Skills\" (). The plans were originally released in Oak Ridge National Laboratory publication ORNL-5040, \"The KFM, A Homemade Yet Accurate and Dependable Fallout Meter\" and have been formatted in a newsprint-ready layout so that they may be quickly printed with accurate dimensions in local newspapers. It must be built from a correctly scaled copy of the plans; photocopies and printouts of digital copies may not be to scale.\n\nDevised in 1978 by Cresson Kearny, the Kearny fallout meter is an application of the gold-leaf electroscope developed in 1787 by Abraham Bennet. Prior to this, the use of the electrometer principle for radiation detection had seen widespread application in the form of the quartz fiber dosimeter. Professional radiation meters, while more accurate and more durable, had a number of potential issues, including cost and lack of availability, which it was hoped the Kearny fallout meter would address.\n\nCommercially made radiation meters are typically based on electronic circuitry or require a battery-powered charging apparatus, allowing susceptibility to battery shortages and to electromagnetic pulse. The Kearny fallout meter was designed to utilize static electricity, produced by (for example) a hard plastic rubbed on dry paper. The KFM was also designed to be less expensive to build than the purchase price of dosimeters and to be made out of commonly available materials, such that they could be constructed even after a disaster. Most commercial radiation meters also require initial and periodic professional calibration, but \"... if a KFM is made and maintained with the specified dimensions and of the specified materials, its accuracy is automatically and permanently established by unchanging laws of nature\".\n\nThe designed operating range is from 30 mR/h to 43 R/h, with accuracy of ±25%.  \"A KFM looks like a toy\" has been cited as a \"major disadvantage\" of the design.\n\nAn electrostatic charge is placed upon two aluminium foil leaves, causing them to repel. As radiation strikes the meter, the foil leaves lose their charge and start to droop. This droop can be measured, and its rate can be established. The KFM has been used as a science project, demonstrating the effects of ionizing radiation.\n\nThe dimensions of a KFM and the weight of its leaves permanently establish its calibration, when built as specified with a properly sized scale.\n\n\n\n"}

His superiors then sent him to their house of studies at Heiligenkreuz Abbey near Vienna, where he studied philosophy and theology. After his ordination to the priesthood he was made professor of history and canon law. His scholarly works attracted attention and won for him in 1858 the chair of ecclesiastical history in the University of Vienna.\n\nIn 1859 he was recalled by his superiors to Heiligenkreuz, where he continued as professor until 1877. During this time he composed his first major work, \"Originum Cisterciensium Liber Primus\" (Vienna, 1877), in which he describes the foundation of the Cistercian Order, its organization and extension, and mentions many of those who, under various titles, had honoured it. He gives a lengthy account of 742 ancient abbeys of monks, founded between the end of the 11th and the end of the 17th centuries.

{"id": "1525262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1525262", "title": "Middlebrow", "text": "Middlebrow\n\nThe term middlebrow describes easily accessible art, usually literature, and the people who use the arts to acquire culture and \"class\" (social prestige). First used in the British satire magazine \"Punch\" in 1925, the term \"middlebrow\" is the intermediary \"brow\" descriptor between \"highbrow\" and \"lowbrow\", which are terms derived from the pseudo-science of phrenology.\n\nThe term middlebrow became a pejorative usage in the modernist cultural criticism, by Dwight Macdonald, Virginia Woolf, and Russell Lynes, which served the cause of the marginalization of the popular culture in favor of high culture. Culturally, the middlebrow is classed as a forced and ineffective attempt at cultural and intellectual achievement, and as characterizing literature that emphasizes emotional and sentimental connections, rather than intellectual quality and literary innovation; although postmodernism more readily perceives the advantages of the middlebrow cultural-position that is aware of high culture, but is able to balance aesthetic claims with the claims of the everyday world.\n\nVirginia Woolf derided the middlebrow in an un-posted letter to the editor of the \"New Statesman & Nation\", concerning a radio broadcast that attacked the Highbrows. That letter was posthumously published in the essay collection \"The Death of the Moth\" (1942).\n\nWoolf criticizes middlebrows as petty purveyors of highbrow cultures for their own shallow benefit. Rather than selecting books for their intrinsic cultural value, middlebrow people select and read what they are told is best. Middlebrows are concerned with \"how\" what they do makes them appear, unlike highbrows, the avant-garde men and women who act according to their indelible commitment to beauty, value, art, form, and integrity. Woolf said that, \"We highbrows read what we like and do what we like and praise what we like\". Likewise, a lowbrow is devoted to a singular interest, a person \"of thoroughbred vitality who rides his body in pursuit of a living at a gallop across life\"; and, therefore, the lowbrow are equally worthy of reverence, as they, too, are living for what they intrinsically know as valuable.\n\nInstead of such freedom, the middlebrows are \"betwixt and between\", which Woolf classifies as \"in pursuit of no single object, neither Art itself nor life itself, but both mixed indistinguishably, and rather nastily, with money, fame, power, or prestige.\" Their value system rewards quick gains through literature already designated as 'Classic' and 'Great', never of their own choosing, because \"to buy living art requires living taste.\" The middlebrow are meretricious—which is much less demanding than authenticity.\n\n\"Harper's Magazine\" editor Russell Lynes satirized Virginia Woolf's highbrow scorn in the article \"Highbrow, Lowbrow, Middlebrow\". Quoting her and other highbrow proponents, such as art critic Clement Greenberg, Lynes parodied the highbrow's pompous superiority by noting how the subtle distinctions Woolf found significant among the \"brows\" were just means of upholding cultural superiority. Specifically, he parodies the highbrow claim that the products a person uses distinguishes his or her level of cultural worth, by satirically identifying the products that would identify a middlebrow person.\n\nLynes continued distinguishing among \"brows\", dividing middlebrow into upper-middlebrow and lower-middlebrow. The upper-middlebrow's arts patronage makes highbrow activity possible. Museums, orchestras, operas, and publishing houses are run by upper-middlebrows. The lower middlebrows attempt using the arts for self-enhancement: \"hell-bent on improving their minds as well as their fortunes\". They also intend to live the simple, easy life outlined in advertisements; \"lower middlebrow-ism\" was \"a world that smells of soap\". Caricaturing Woolf, Lynes outlined the perfect world without middlebrows; lowbrows work and highbrows create pure art.\n\nMonths later, \"Life\" magazine asked Lynes to specifically distinguish among the right foods, furniture, clothes, and arts for each of the four 'brows'. That began national preoccupation, as people tried to identify their proper social class, based upon their favorite things. Although \"middlebrow\" often has connoted contempt, Lynes lauded the zeal and aspirations of the middlebrows.\n\nJ. B. Priestley sought to create a positive cultural space around the concept of middlebrow – one characterised by earnestness, friendliness and ethical concerns. He couched his defense of the middlebrow in terms of radio stations, praising the BBC Home Service for its cosiness and plainness, midway between the Light Programme and the Third Programme: \"Between the raucous lowbrows and the lisping highbrows is a fine gap, meant for the middle or broadbrows...our homely fashion\".\n\nIn a struggle that involved competition for readers as well as for cultural capital, Virginia Woolf responded by renaming the BBC the \"Betwixt and Between Company\".\n\nDwight Macdonald's critique of middlebrow culture, \"Masscult and Midcult\" (1960), associated the modern industrial drive, away from specialization and the folk, with creating a mass-market arts, and, therefore, anonymous consumers of the arts. In the U.S., highbrow culture is associated with specialization for the connoisseurs, while lowbrow culture entails authentic folk products made for specific communities. Mass culture (masscult) copies and manipulates both traditions, with factory-created products, made without innovation or care, expressly for the market, \"to please the crowd by any means\", thereby creating an American society in which \"a pluralistic culture cannot exist\", wherein the rule is cultural homogeneity.\n\nIn contrast Midcult (middle culture), came about with middlebrow culture, and dangerously copies and adulterates high culture, by way of \"a tepid ooze of Midcult\", which threatens high culture, with dramaturgy, literature, and architecture, such as \"Our Town\" (1938), \"The Old Man and the Sea\" (1952), and American collegiate gothic architecture.\n\nThe Middlebrow \"pretends to respect the standards of High Culture, while, in fact, it waters them down and vulgarizes them.\" Macdonald recommended a separation of the brows, so that \"the few who care about good writing, painting, music, architecture, philosophy, etc. have their High Culture, and don't fuzz up the distinction with the Midcult.\"\n\nThe Book-of-the-Month Club and Oprah Winfrey's Book Club have been widely characterized as middlebrow, marketed to bring classics and 'highbrow' literature to the middle class. This was particularly highlighted when author Jonathan Franzen, after his book \"The Corrections\" was selected, remarked in several publications that some of Oprah's book club picks were middlebrow In her seminal account of the Book-of-the-Month Club (as it was from its inception in 1926 to the 1980s before it transformed to a purely commercial operation), \"A Feeling for Books\", Janice Radway argues that middlebrow culture is not simply a diluted impersonation of highbrow, but instead distinctly defined itself in defiance of avant-garde high culture. The club provided subscribers with literature selected by expert and 'generalist' judges, but held the personal, emotional experience of reading a good book as paramount, while simultaneously maintaining 'high standards' for literary quality. In this way, the club was in opposition to the general criticism of middlebrow culture in that it is forced high culture. Instead, Radway demonstrates that the middlebrow culture allows readers to simultaneously access the emotional and intellectual challenges that good reading provides. Radway also identifies the conflicting gender messages sent by the selections. While the club was marketed extensively to the female reader, including its emphasis on the emotional pleasure of books, the focus on intellectual, academic literature of the middlebrow trapped the reader into the constrictive masculine standards of value, classifying 'great books' as those that fell in line with male, technical classifications of excellence.\n\n\"Slate Magazine\" suggests that the late 2000s and early 2010s could potentially be considered the \"golden age of middlebrow art\"—pointing to television shows \"Breaking Bad\", \"Mad Men\", \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Wire\" and novels \"Freedom\", \"The Marriage Plot\" and \"A Visit from the Goon Squad\". \"Slate\" also defines the films of Aaron Sorkin as middlebrow. Some argue that \"Slate\" itself is middlebrow journalism.\n\nIn a March 2012 article for \"Jewish Ideas Daily\", Peodair Leihy described the work of poet and songwriter Leonard Cohen as \"a kind of pop—upper-middle-brow to lower-high-brow, to be sure, but pop nonetheless.\" This aesthetic was further theorized in an essay from November that year for \"The American Scholar\" that saw William Deresiewicz propose the addition of \"upper middle brow,\" a culture falling between masscult and midcult. He defined it as, \"infinitely subtler than Midcult. It is post- rather than pre-ironic, its sentimentality hidden by a veil of cool. It is edgy, clever, knowing, stylish, and formally inventive.\"\n\nIn \"The New Yorker\", Macy Halford characterizes \"Harper's Magazine\" and \"The New Yorker\" itself as \"often [being] viewed as prime examples of the middlebrow: both magazines are devoted to the high but also to making it accessible to many; to bringing ideas that might remain trapped in ivory towers and academic books, or in high-art (or film or theatre) scenes, into the pages of a relatively inexpensive periodical that can be bought at bookstores and newsstands across the country (and now on the Internet).\" She also notes the internet's effect on the middlebrow debate: \"Internet is forcing us to rethink (again) what \"middlebrow\" means: in an era when the highest is as accessible as the lowest—accessible in the sense that both are only a click away ... —we actually have to think anew about how to walk that middle line.\" Halford describes Wikipedia: \"...Wiki is itself a kind of middlebrow product\" and links to this middlebrow entry \"because it actually provides a smart summary.\"\n\n"}

She was active in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and the Northern Resistance Movement. \n\nShe was a militant member of the Prisoners' Relatives Action Committee, and the national Hunger Strike Committee. In that campaign, she worked with Seamus Costello, and soon joined him in the Irish Republican Socialist Party and the Irish National Liberation Army.

It is distinct of the architecture of postmodernity in as much as Non-Referential Architecture is a response to a non-referential world. Non-Referential Architecture is liberated of a vocabulary of fixed semantic images, symbols, and historical connotations. Buildings of Non-Referential Architecture are based upon themselves – they are based on architecture-inherent qualities such as architectural space and form and the experience of space they cause in the inhabitants and visitors. Buildings of Non-Referential Architecture are distinctly different from their precursors of modernism and postmodernism because they are not the outcome of extra-architectural concepts and ideas, such as importations and thematizations, for example, taken from the realms of the economic, the ecological, or the political. \n\nIn the book Non-Referential Architecture, Swiss architect Valerio Olgiati and USA-based Swiss architectural theoretician Markus Breitschmid write: \"Non-referential architecture is not an architecture that subsists as a referential vessel or as a symbol of something outside itself. Non-referential buildings are entities that are themselves meaningful and sense-making and, as such, no less the embodiment of society than buildings were in the past when they were the bearers of common social ideals.\"\n\nNon-Referential Architecture is a response to a contemporary societal current that increasingly rejects ideologies of any kind, political and otherwise. While ideologies were the innovation of modernity and postmodernity, the non-referential world is increasingly devoid of ideologies or it rejects to order the world in ideological ways. Valerio Olgiati has worked on the possibilities of a Non-Referential Architecture for years. The first documented use of the term Non-Referential in architecture appears in a reprint of an interview between Olgiati and Breitschmid in the Italian architecture journal Domus. In 2014, Breitschmid publishes a rebuttal titled \"Architektur leitet sich von Architektur ab\" (Architecture is Derived from Architecture) in the Swiss journal Werk, Bauen + Wohnen, thereby responding to an architectural claim made by others that attempts to imbue meaning into architecture from the extra-architectural, such as the economic, ecological, political. Architect Christian Kerez investigated the limits of referentiality and speaks of \"non-referential space\" as a quality of his contribution for the Venice Biennale of Architecture in 2016. In the same year, architect Peter Eisenman points out that architecture has been moving toward a “non-referential ‘objectivity’” for some time, in as much as architectural form is increasingly reduced “to a pure reality.” \n\nIn 2018, Olgiati and Breitschmid published the architectural treatise Non-Referential Architecture, a book that has been in the making since 2013. It analyses the societal currents of the early 21st century and argues that those currents are radically different from the epoch of postmodernity. The book proposes a new framework for architecture and defines the seven underlying principles for Non-Referential Architecture:\n1) Experience of Space; \n2) Oneness; \n3) Newness; \n4) Construction; \n5) Contradiction; \n6) Order; \n7) Sensemaking.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Non-Referential Architecture is that each building exists for itself. Each building is governed by an architectural idea – and that idea has to be form-generative and sense-making. Non-Referential Architecture states: \"Non-referential architecture denotes but it refuses to explain or narrate, and it leaves behind any vestiges of a theatrical mode of persuasion and propagation.\" Describing the intent of the exhibition ‘Inscriptions: Architecture before Speech’, held at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Design in 2018, K. Michael Hays argues that today’s architecture presupposes “not a particular meaning, but a specific kind of potentiality — a non-semantic materiality, a non-referential construct that can be developed into an actual architectural project.”\n"}

{"id": "23612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23612", "title": "Postmodern philosophy", "text": "Postmodern philosophy\n\nPostmodern philosophy is a philosophical movement that arose in the second half of the 20th century as a critical response to assumptions allegedly present in modernist philosophical ideas regarding culture, identity, history, or language that were developed during the 18th-century Enlightenment. Postmodernist thinkers developed concepts like difference, repetition, trace, and hyperreality to subvert \"grand narratives,\" univocity of being, and epistemic certainty. Postmodern philosophy questions the importance of power relationships, personalization, and discourse in the \"construction\" of truth and world views. Many postmodernists appear to deny that an objective reality exists, and appear to deny that there are objective moral values.\n\nJean-François Lyotard defined philosophical postmodernism in \"The Postmodern Condition\", writing \"Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives,\" where what he means by metanarrative is something like a unified, complete, universal, and epistemically certain story about everything that is. Postmodernists reject metanarratives because they reject the concept of truth that metanarratives presuppose. Postmodernist philosophers in general argue that truth is always contingent on historical and social context rather than being absolute and universal and that truth is always partial and \"at issue\" rather than being complete and certain.\n\nPostmodern philosophy is often particularly skeptical about simple binary oppositions characteristic of structuralism, emphasizing the problem of the philosopher cleanly distinguishing knowledge from ignorance, social progress from reversion, dominance from submission, good from bad, and presence from absence. But, for the same reasons, postmodern philosophy should often be particularly skeptical about the complex spectral characteristics of things, emphasizing the problem of the philosopher again cleanly distinguishing concepts, for a concept must be understood in the context of its opposite, such as existence and nothingness, normality and abnormality, speech and writing, and the like.\n\nPostmodern philosophy also has strong relations with the substantial literature of critical theory.\n\nMany postmodern claims are a deliberate repudiation of certain 18th-century Enlightenment values. Such a postmodernist believes that there is no objective natural reality, and that logic and reason are mere conceptual constructs that are not universally valid. Two other characteristic postmodern practices are a denial that human nature exists, and a (sometimes moderate) skepticism toward claims that science and technology will change society for the better. Postmodernists also believe there are no objective moral values. Thus, postmodern philosophy suggests equality for all things. One's concept of good and another's concept of evil are to be equally correct, since good and evil are subjective. Since both good and evil are equally correct, a postmodernist then tolerates both concepts, even if he or she disagrees with them subjectively. Postmodern writings often focus on deconstructing the role that power and ideology play in shaping discourse and belief. Postmodern philosophy shares ontological similarities with classical skeptical and relativistic belief systems, and shares political similarities with modern identity politics.\n\nThe \"Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" states that \"The assumption that there is no common denominator in 'nature' or 'truth' ... that guarantees the possibility of neutral or objective thought\" is a key assumption of postmodernism. The National Research Council has characterized the belief that \"social science research can never generate objective or trustworthy knowledge\" as an example of a postmodernist belief. Jean-François Lyotard's seminal 1979 \"The Postmodern Condition\" stated that its hypotheses \"should not be accorded predictive value in relation to reality, but strategic value in relation to the questions raised\". Lyotard's statement in 1984 that \"I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives\" extends to incredulity toward science. Jacques Derrida, who is generally identified as a postmodernist, stated that \"every referent, all reality has the structure of a differential trace\". Paul Feyerabend, one of the most famous twentieth-century philosophers of science, is often classified as a postmodernist; Feyerabend held that modern science is no more justified than witchcraft, and has denounced the \"tyranny\" of \"abstract concepts such as 'truth', 'reality', or 'objectivity', which narrow people's vision and ways of being in the world\". Feyerabend also defended astrology, adopted alternative medicine, and sympathized with creationism. Defenders of postmodernism state that many descriptions of postmodernism exaggerate its antipathy to science; for example, Feyerabend denied that he was \"anti-science\", accepted that some scientific \"theories\" are superior to other theories (even if science itself is not superior to other modes of inquiry), and attempted conventional medical treatments during his fight against cancer.\n\nPhilosopher John Deely has argued for the contentious claim that the label \"postmodern\" for thinkers such as Derrida \"et al.\" is \"premature\". Insofar as the \"so-called\" postmoderns follow the thoroughly \"modern\" trend of idealism, it is more an \"ultra\"modernism than anything else. A postmodernism that lives up to its name, therefore, must no longer confine itself to the premodern preoccupation with \"things\" nor with the modern confinement to \"ideas,\" but must come to terms with the way of signs embodied in the semiotic doctrines of such thinkers as the Portuguese philosopher John Poinsot and the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce. Writes Deely,\n\nThe epoch of Greek and Latin philosophy was based on \"being\" in a quite precise sense: the existence exercised by things independently of human apprehension and attitude. The much briefer epoch of modern philosophy based itself rather on the instruments of human knowing, but in a way that unnecessarily compromised being. As the 20th century ends, there is reason to believe that a new philosophical epoch is dawning along with the new century, promising to be the richest epoch yet for human understanding. The postmodern era is positioned to synthesize at a higher level—the level of experience, where the being of things and the activity of the finite knower compenetrate one another and provide the materials whence can be derived knowledge of nature and knowledge of culture in their full symbiosis—the achievements of the ancients and the moderns in a way that gives full credit to the preoccupations of the two. The postmodern era has for its distinctive task in philosophy the exploration of a new path, no longer the ancient way of things nor the modern way of ideas, but the way of signs, whereby the peaks and valleys of ancient and modern thought alike can be surveyed and cultivated by a generation which has yet further peaks to climb and valleys to find.\nPostmodern philosophy originated primarily in France during the mid-20th century. However, several philosophical antecedents inform many of postmodern philosophy's concerns.\n\nIt was greatly influenced by the writings of Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche in the 19th century and other early-to-mid 20th-century philosophers, including phenomenologists Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, structuralist Roland Barthes, Georges Bataille, and the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Postmodern philosophy also drew from the world of the arts and architecture, particularly Marcel Duchamp, John Cage and artists who practiced collage, and the architecture of Las Vegas and the Pompidou Centre.\n\nThe most influential early postmodern philosophers were Jean Baudrillard, Jean-François Lyotard, and Jacques Derrida. Michel Foucault is also often cited as an early postmodernist although he personally rejected that label. Following Nietzsche, Foucault argued that knowledge is produced through the operations of \"power\", and changes fundamentally in different historical periods.\n\nThe writings of Lyotard were largely concerned with the role of narrative in human culture, and particularly how that role has changed as we have left modernity and entered a \"postindustrial\" or postmodern condition. He argued that modern philosophies legitimized their truth-claims not (as they themselves claimed) on logical or empirical grounds, but rather on the grounds of accepted stories (or \"metanarratives\") about knowledge and the world—comparing these with Wittgenstein's concept of language-games. He further argued that in our postmodern condition, these metanarratives no longer work to legitimize truth-claims. He suggested that in the wake of the collapse of modern metanarratives, people are developing a new \"language-game\"—one that does not make claims to absolute truth but rather celebrates a world of ever-changing relationships (among people and between people and the world).\n\nDerrida, the father of deconstruction, practiced philosophy as a form of textual criticism. He criticized Western philosophy as privileging the concept of presence and \"logos\", as opposed to absence and markings or writings.\n\nIn the United States, the most famous pragmatist and self-proclaimed postmodernist was Richard Rorty. An analytic philosopher, Rorty believed that combining Willard Van Orman Quine's criticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction with Wilfrid Sellars's critique of the \"Myth of the Given\" allowed for an abandonment of the view of the thought or language as a mirror of a reality or external world. Further, drawing upon Donald Davidson's criticism of the dualism between conceptual scheme and empirical content, he challenges the sense of questioning whether our particular concepts are related to the world in an appropriate way, whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways. He argued that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of a social practice and language was what served our purposes in a particular time; ancient languages are sometimes untranslatable into modern ones because they possess a different vocabulary and are unuseful today. Donald Davidson is not usually considered a postmodernist, although he and Rorty have both acknowledged that there are few differences between their philosophies.\n\nCritics claim that postmodernism is nonsensical or self-contradictory.\n\n\n\n"}

Based in Stockholm, Sweden, King Gustav III founded the ballet in 1773 as a part of his national cultural project in response to the French and Italian dominance in this field; he also founded the Royal Swedish Opera and the Royal Dramatic Theatre. All of these were initially located in the old theatre of Bollhuset. The troupe was founded with the opening of the Royal Swedish Opera, which has served as its home since that time.\n\nIn 1773, the cultural professions of acting, opera-singing and ballet-dancing in Sweden were all performed by foreign troupes. The first ballet performance was performed at the Swedish court when the French ballet troupe of Antoine de Beaulieu was hired at the court of Queen Christina in 1638, and the first Public ballet performance were performed by the foreign theatre troupes at the theatre of Bollhuset later the same century. The only exception had been the period of 1737–1753, when the first professional Swedish troupe of actors had performed at Bollhuset; during this period, ballets were performed by the first Swedish dancers in this troupe. The perhaps first ballet performed by professional native Swedish dancers was in the play \"Den afvundsiuke\" (\"The Envious\") by Olof von Dahlin in August 1738. However, no names are known about these first dancers. They were probably educated by Jean Marquard as dancing-master, and one of the dancers were also French, Gabriel Senac. In 1753, however, the first Swedish ballet, theatre and opera at Bollhuset were dissolved. \n\nGustav III wanted to create and educate native talents in these professions. To accomplish this, he used the same method in the ballet as he was to use with the theatre; by having the first generation of native dancers educated by foreign professionals. When he fired the French theatre-company to create his national-stage in 1773, he kept many of the French dancers of this troupe. Dancers from France, Italy and Belgium, such as Antoine Bournonville, Louis Gallodier, Giovanna Bassi and Julie Alix de la Fay were hired to perform and to educate Swedish students. Most of the first students to the troupe were taken among children to the staff at the royal court and to professional musicians, as were the first students to the theatre and the opera. In the first ballet-troupe in the national stage of 1773, they were very few native talents with former professional experience; one of them was Charlotte Slottsberg, who could be counted as the first native Swedish ballerina known by name. The greatest triumph of the Swedish ballet during the 18th century is considered to be the Ballet performed by Gallodier to the Opera \"Gustav Adolf och Ebba Brahe\" (Gustav Adolf and Ebba Brahe) (1786); also the Ballet \"Fiskarna\" (The Fishes) by Antoine Bournonville (1789) became a great success. \n\nThe Ballet was from the beginning closely linked to the Opera; ballets were a part of the performances of the Opera, and the dancers were also active on the Royal Dramatic Theatre. When the Royal Swedish Opera were closed down between 1806 and 1809–1812, the Ballet was not closed, only moved over to the theatre. \n\nDuring the 19th century, new ballets were made all the time, and older ones seldom performed; \"En komisk balett\" (A comic Ballet) by Louis Deland was given 127 times between 1796 and 1809, followed by La Fille Mal Gardée, given 54 times in 1812–1842. August Bournonville was active as a guest Ballet master 1839, 1847, 1857, 1858 and 1861–1864, and his favorite Swedish ballerinas Charlotta Norberg and Johanna Sundberg educated students in his techniques. The Ballet is considered to have been in a state of decay during the end of the 19th century; after the dismissal of Anders Selinder and Sophie Daguin in 1856, the Ballet was used more as a supplement to the opera and not as an independent artform, and Sigurd Lund, a student of Bournonville, was not independent enough to prevent this. It was not until 1913, that the Ballet returned to a more independent form. \n\nThe \"Kungliga Hovkapellet\" (Royal Swedish Orchestra), the orchestra of the Royal Swedish Opera, is the performing partner for the Royal Swedish Ballet.\n\nNicolas LeRiche is the director of the Royal Swedish Ballet.\nBirgitta Svendén is the general director of the Royal Swedish Opera. The members of Operans Balettklubb are supporters of the Royal Swedish Ballet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStockholm 59° North is a chamber company of soloist dancers from the Royal Swedish Ballet.\n\nArtistic Director is Mia Hjelte.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1571390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1571390", "title": "Sociocultural evolution", "text": "Sociocultural evolution\n\nSociocultural evolution, sociocultural evolutionism or cultural evolution are theories of cultural and social evolution that describe how cultures and societies change over time. Whereas sociocultural development traces processes that tend to increase the complexity of a society or culture, sociocultural evolution also considers process that can lead to decreases in complexity (degeneration) or that can produce variation or proliferation without any seemingly significant changes in complexity (cladogenesis). Sociocultural evolution is \"the process by which structural reorganization is affected through time, eventually producing a form or structure which is qualitatively different from the ancestral form\".\n\nMost of the 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches to socioculture aimed to provide models for the evolution of humankind as a whole, arguing that different societies have reached different stages of social development. The most comprehensive attempt to develop a general theory of social evolution centering on the development of sociocultural systems, the work of Talcott Parsons (1902–1979), operated on a scale which included a theory of world history. Another attempt, on a less systematic scale, originated with the world-systems approach from the 1970s.\nMore recent approaches focus on changes specific to individual societies and reject the idea that cultures differ primarily according to how far each one is on some linear scale of social progress. Most modern archaeologists and cultural anthropologists work within the frameworks of neoevolutionism, sociobiology, and modernization theory.\n\nMany different societies have existed in the course of human history, with estimates as high as a total of over one million separate societies; however, , the number of current, distinct societies had been estimated as only about two hundred.\n\nAnthropologists and sociologists often assume that human beings have natural social tendencies and that particular human social behaviours have non-genetic causes and dynamics (i.e. people learn them in a social environment and through social interaction). Societies exist in complex social environments (i.e. with natural resources and constraints) and adapt themselves to these environments. It is thus inevitable that all societies change.\n\nSpecific theories of social or cultural evolution often attempt to explain differences between coeval societies by positing that different societies have reached different stages of development. Although such theories typically provide models for understanding the relationship between technologies, social structure or the values of a society, they vary as to the extent to which they describe specific mechanisms of variation and change.\n\nEarly sociocultural evolution theoriesthe ideas of Auguste Comte (1798–1857), Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) and Lewis Henry Morgan (1818–1881) developed simultaneously with, but independently of, Charles Darwin's works and were popular from the late 19th century to the end of World War I. These 19th-century unilineal evolution theories claimed that societies start out in a \"primitive\" state and gradually become more \"civilized\" over time; they equated the culture and technology of Western civilization with progress. Some forms of early sociocultural evolution theories (mainly unilineal ones) have led to much-criticised theories like social Darwinism and scientific racism, sometimes used in the past to justify existing policies of colonialism and slavery and to justify new policies such as eugenics.\n\nMost 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches aimed to provide models for the evolution of humankind as a single entity. However, most 20th-century approaches, such as multilineal evolution, focused on changes specific to individual societies. Moreover, they rejected directional change (i.e. orthogenetic, teleological or progressive change). Most archaeologists work within the framework of multilineal evolution. Other contemporary approaches to social change include neoevolutionism, sociobiology, dual inheritance theory, modernisation theory and postindustrial theory.\n\nIn his seminal 1976 book \"The Selfish Gene\", Richard Dawkins wrote that \"there are some examples of cultural evolution in birds and monkeys, but ... it is our own species that really shows what cultural evolution can do\".\n\nEnlightenment and later thinkers often speculated that societies progressed through stages: in other words, they saw history as stadial. While expecting humankind to show increasing development, theorists looked for what determined the course of human history. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), for example, saw social development as an inevitable process. It was assumed that societies start out primitive, perhaps in a state of nature, and could progress toward something resembling industrial Europe.\n\nWhile earlier authors such as Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) had discussed how societies change through time, the Scottish Enlightenment of the 18th century proved key in the development of the idea of sociocultural evolution. In relation to Scotland's union with England in 1707, several Scottish thinkers pondered the relationship between progress and the affluence brought about by increased trade with England. They understood the changes Scotland was undergoing as involving transition from an agricultural to a mercantile society. In \"conjectural histories\", authors such as Adam Ferguson (1723–1816), John Millar (1735–1801) and Adam Smith (1723–1790) argued that societies all pass through a series of four stages: hunting and gathering, pastoralism and nomadism, agriculture, and finally a stage of commerce.\n\nPhilosophical concepts of progress, such as that of Hegel, developed as well during this period. In France, authors such as Claude Adrien Helvétius (1715–1771) and other philosophes were influenced by the Scottish tradition. Later thinkers such as Comte de Saint-Simon (1760–1825) developed these ideas. Auguste Comte (1798–1857) in particular presented a coherent view of social progress and a new discipline to study it: sociology.\n\nThese developments took place in a context of wider processes. The first process was colonialism. Although imperial powers settled most differences of opinion with their colonial subjects through force, increased awareness of non-Western peoples raised new questions for European scholars about the nature of society and of culture. Similarly, effective colonial administration required some degree of understanding of other cultures. Emerging theories of sociocultural evolution allowed Europeans to organise their new knowledge in a way that reflected and justified their increasing political and economic domination of others: such systems saw colonised people as less evolved, and colonising people as more evolved. Modern civilization (understood as the Western civilization), appeared the result of steady progress from a state of barbarism, and such a notion was common to many thinkers of the Enlightenment, including Voltaire (1694–1778).\n\nThe second process was the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism, which together allowed and promoted continual revolutions in the means of production. Emerging theories of sociocultural evolution reflected a belief that the changes in Europe brought by the Industrial Revolution and capitalism were improvements. Industrialisation, combined with the intense political change brought about by the French Revolution of 1789 and the U.S. Constitution, which paved the way for the dominance of democracy, forced European thinkers to reconsider some of their assumptions about how society was organised.\n\nEventually, in the 19th century three major classical theories of social and historical change emerged:\n\n\nThese theories had a common factor: they all agreed that the history of humanity is pursuing a certain fixed path, most likely that of social progress. Thus, each past event is not only chronologically, but causally tied to present and future events. The theories postulated that by recreating the sequence of those events, sociology could discover the \"laws\" of history.\n\nWhile sociocultural evolutionists agree that an evolution-like process leads to social progress, classical social evolutionists have developed many different theories, known as theories of unilineal evolution. Sociocultural evolutionism became the prevailing theory of early sociocultural anthropology and social commentary, and is associated with scholars like Auguste Comte, Edward Burnett Tylor, Lewis Henry Morgan, Benjamin Kidd, L. T. Hobhouse and Herbert Spencer. Sociocultural evolutionism attempted to formalise social thinking along scientific lines, with the added influence from the biological theory of evolution. If organisms could develop over time according to discernible, deterministic laws, then it seemed reasonable that societies could as well. Human society was compared to a biological organism, and social science equivalents of concepts like variation, natural selection, and inheritance were introduced as factors resulting in the progress of societies. The idea of progress led to that of a fixed \"stages\" through which human societies progress, usually numbering threesavagery, barbarism, and civilizationbut sometimes many more. As early as the late 18th century, the Marquis de Condorcet (1743–1794) listed ten stages, or \"epochs\", each advancing the rights of man and perfecting the human race. At that time, anthropology was rising as a new scientific discipline, separating from the traditional views of \"primitive\" cultures that was usually based on religious views.\n\nClassical social evolutionism is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of Auguste Comte and of Herbert Spencer (coiner of the phrase \"survival of the fittest\"). In many ways, Spencer's theory of \"cosmic evolution\" has much more in common with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Auguste Comte than with contemporary works of Charles Darwin. Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as social evolutionism. Although he wrote that societies over time progressedand that progress was accomplished through competitionhe stressed that the individual rather than the collectivity is the unit of analysis that evolves; that, in other words, evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon. Nonetheless, the publication of Darwin's works proved a boon to the proponents of sociocultural evolution, who saw the ideas of biological evolution as an attractive explanation for many questions about the development of society.\n\nBoth Spencer and Comte view society as a kind of organism subject to the process of growth—from simplicity to complexity, from chaos to order, from generalisation to specialisation, from flexibility to organisation. They agree that the process of societal growth can be divided into certain stages, have their beginning and eventual end, and that this growth is in fact social progress: each newer, more-evolved society is \"better\". Thus progressivism became one of the basic ideas underlying the theory of sociocultural evolutionism.\n\nAuguste Comte, known as \"the father of sociology\", formulated the law of three stages: human development progresses from the theological stage, in which nature was mythically conceived and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from supernatural beings; through a metaphysical stage in which nature was conceived of as a result of obscure forces and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from them; until the final positive stage in which all abstract and obscure forces are discarded, and natural phenomena are explained by their constant relationship. This progress is forced through the development of human mind, and through increasing application of thought, reasoning and logic to the understanding of the world. Comte saw the science-valuing society as the highest, most developed type of human organization.\n\nHerbert Spencer, who argued against government intervention as he believed that society should evolve toward more individual freedom, differentiated between two phases of development as regards societies' internal regulation: the \"military\" and \"industrial\" societies. The earlier (and more primitive) military society has the goal of conquest and defense, is centralised, economically self-sufficient, collectivistic, puts the good of a group over the good of an individual, uses compulsion, force and repression, and rewards loyalty, obedience and discipline. The industrial society, in contrast, has a goal of production and trade, is decentralised, interconnected with other societies via economic relations, works through voluntary cooperation and individual self-restraint, treats the good of individual as of the highest value, regulates the social life via voluntary relations; and values initiative, independence and innovation. The transition process from the military to industrial society is the outcome of steady evolutionary processes within the society.\n\nRegardless of how scholars of Spencer interpret his relation to Darwin, Spencer became an incredibly popular figure in the 1870s, particularly in the United States. Authors such as Edward L. Youmans, William Graham Sumner, John Fiske, John W. Burgess, Lester Frank Ward, Lewis H. Morgan (1818–1881) and other thinkers of the gilded age all developed theories of social evolutionism as a result of their exposure to Spencer as well as to Darwin.\n\nIn his 1877 classic \"Ancient Societies\", Lewis H. Morgan, an anthropologist whose ideas have had much impact on sociology, differentiated between three eras: savagery, barbarism and civilization, which are divided by technological inventions, like fire, bow, pottery in the savage era, domestication of animals, agriculture, metalworking in the barbarian era and alphabet and writing in the civilization era. Thus Morgan drew a link between social progress and technological progress. Morgan viewed technological progress as a force behind social progress, and held that any social change—in social institutions, organizations or ideologies—has its beginnings in technological change. Morgan's theories were popularized by Friedrich Engels, who based his famous work \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\" on them. For Engels and other Marxists this theory was important, as it supported their conviction that materialistic factors—economic and technological—are decisive in shaping the fate of humanity.\n\nEdward Burnett Tylor (1832–1917), a pioneer of anthropology, focused on the evolution of culture worldwide, noting that culture is an important part of every society and that it is also subject to a process of evolution. He believed that societies were at different stages of cultural development and that the purpose of anthropology was to reconstruct the evolution of culture, from primitive beginnings to the modern state.\nAnthropologists Sir E.B. Tylor in England and Lewis Henry Morgan in the United States worked with data from indigenous people, who (they claimed) represented earlier stages of cultural evolution that gave insight into the process and progression of evolution of culture. Morgan would later have a significant influence on Karl Marx and on Friedrich Engels, who developed a theory of sociocultural evolution in which the internal contradictions in society generated a series of escalating stages that ended in a socialist society (see Marxism). Tylor and Morgan elaborated the theory of unilinear evolution, specifying criteria for categorising cultures according to their standing within a fixed system of growth of humanity as a whole and examining the modes and mechanisms of this growth. Theirs was often a concern with culture in general, not with individual cultures.\n\nTheir analysis of cross-cultural data was based on three assumptions:\nTheorists usually measured progression (that is, the difference between one stage and the next) in terms of increasing social complexity (including class differentiation and a complex division of labour), or an increase in intellectual, theological, and aesthetic sophistication. These 19th-century ethnologists used these principles primarily to explain differences in religious beliefs and kinship terminologies among various societies.\n\nLester Frank Ward (1841–1913), sometimes referred to as the \"father\" of American sociology, rejected many of Spencer's theories regarding the evolution of societies. Ward, who was also a botanist and a paleontologist, believed that the law of evolution functioned much differently in human societies than it did in the plant and animal kingdoms, and theorized that the \"law of nature\" had been superseded by the \"law of the mind\". He stressed that humans, driven by emotions, create goals for themselves and strive to realize them (most effectively with the modern scientific method) whereas there is no such intelligence and awareness guiding the non-human world. Plants and animals adapt to nature; man shapes nature. While Spencer believed that competition and \"survival of the fittest\" benefited human society and sociocultural evolution, Ward regarded competition as a destructive force, pointing out that all human institutions, traditions and laws were tools invented by the mind of man and that that mind designed them, like all tools, to \"meet and checkmate\" the unrestrained competition of natural forces. Ward agreed with Spencer that authoritarian governments repress the talents of the individual, but he believed that modern democratic societies, which minimized the role of religion and maximized that of science, could effectively support the individual in his or her attempt to fully utilize their talents and achieve happiness. He believed that the evolutionary processes have four stages:\n\n\nWhile Ward regarded modern societies as superior to \"primitive\" societies (one need only look to the impact of medical science on health and lifespan) he rejected theories of white supremacy; he supported the Out-of-Africa theory of human evolution and believed that all races and social classes were equal in talent. However, Ward did not think that evolutionary progress was inevitable and he feared the degeneration of societies and cultures, which he saw as very evident in the historical record. Ward also did not favor the radical reshaping of society as proposed by the supporters of the eugenics movement or by the followers of Karl Marx; like Comte, Ward believed that sociology was the most complex of the sciences and that true sociogenesis was impossible without considerable research and experimentation.\n\nÉmile Durkheim, another of the \"fathers\" of sociology, developed a dichotomal view of social progress. His key concept was social solidarity, as he defined social evolution in terms of progressing from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity. In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration and thus there is the need for the use of force and repression to keep society together. In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation are extensive. Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based firstly on population growth and increasing population density, secondly on increasing \"morality density\" (development of more complex social interactions) and thirdly on increasing specialisation in the workplace. To Durkheim, the most important factor in social progress is the division of labour. This was later used in the mid-1900s by the economist Ester Boserup (1910–1999) to attempt to discount some aspects of Malthusian theory.\n\nFerdinand Tönnies (1855–1936) describes evolution as the development from informal society, where people have many liberties and there are few laws and obligations, to modern, formal rational society, dominated by traditions and laws, where people are restricted from acting as they wish. He also notes that there is a tendency to standardisation and unification, when all smaller societies are absorbed into a single, large, modern society. Thus Tönnies can be said to describe part of the process known today as globalization. Tönnies was also one of the first sociologists to claim that the evolution of society is not necessarily going in the right direction, that social progress is not perfect, and it can even be called a regression as the newer, more evolved societies are obtained only after paying a high cost, resulting in decreasing satisfaction of the individuals making up that society. Tönnies' work became the foundation of neoevolutionism.\n\nAlthough Max Weber is not usually counted as a sociocultural evolutionist, his theory of tripartite classification of authority can be viewed as an evolutionary theory as well. Weber distinguishes three ideal types of political leadership, domination and authority:\n\n\nWeber also notes that legal domination is the most advanced, and that societies evolve from having mostly traditional and charismatic authorities to mostly rational and legal ones.\n\nThe early 20th-century inaugurated a period of systematic critical examination, and rejection of the sweeping generalisations of the unilineal theories of sociocultural evolution. Cultural anthropologists such as Franz Boas (1858–1942), along with his students, including Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead, are regarded as the leaders of anthropology's rejection of classical social evolutionism.\n\nThey used sophisticated ethnography and more rigorous empirical methods to argue that Spencer, Tylor, and Morgan's theories were speculative and systematically misrepresented ethnographic data. Theories regarding \"stages\" of evolution were especially criticised as illusions. Additionally, they rejected the distinction between \"primitive\" and \"civilized\" (or \"modern\"), pointing out that so-called primitive contemporary societies have just as much history, and were just as evolved, as so-called civilized societies. They therefore argued that any attempt to use this theory to reconstruct the histories of non-literate (i.e. leaving no historical documents) peoples is entirely speculative and unscientific.\n\nThey observed that the postulated progression, which typically ended with a stage of civilization identical to that of modern Europe, is ethnocentric. They also pointed out that the theory assumes that societies are clearly bounded and distinct, when in fact cultural traits and forms often cross social boundaries and diffuse among many different societies (and are thus an important mechanism of change). Boas in his culture-history approach focused on anthropological fieldwork in an attempt to identify factual processes instead of what he criticized as speculative stages of growth. His approach greatly influenced American anthropology in the first half of the 20th century, and marked a retreat from high-level generalization and from \"systems building\".\n\nLater critics observed that the assumption of firmly bounded societies was proposed precisely at the time when European powers were colonising non-Western societies, and was thus self-serving. Many anthropologists and social theorists now consider unilineal cultural and social evolution a Western myth seldom based on solid empirical grounds. Critical theorists argue that notions of social evolution are simply justifications for power by the élites of society. Finally, the devastating World Wars that occurred between 1914 and 1945 crippled Europe's self-confidence. After millions of deaths, genocide, and the destruction of Europe's industrial infrastructure, the idea of progress seemed dubious at best.\n\nThus modern sociocultural evolutionism rejects most of classical social evolutionism due to various theoretical problems:\n\nBecause social evolution was posited as a scientific theory, it was often used to support unjust and often racist social practices — particularly colonialism, slavery, and the unequal economic conditions present within industrialized Europe. Social Darwinism is especially criticised, as it purportedly led to some philosophies used by the Nazis.\n\nWeber's major works in economic sociology and the sociology of religion dealt with the rationalization, secularisation, and so called \"disenchantment\" which he associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity. In sociology, rationalization is the process whereby an increasing number of social actions become based on considerations of teleological efficiency or calculation rather than on motivations derived from morality, emotion, custom, or tradition. Rather than referring to what is genuinely \"rational\" or \"logical\", rationalization refers to a relentless quest for goals that might actually function to the \"detriment\" of a society. Rationalization is an ambivalent aspect of modernity, manifested especially in Western society - as a behaviour of the capitalist market, of rational administration in the state and bureaucracy, of the extension of modern science, and of the expansion of modern technology.\n\nWeber's thought regarding the rationalizing and secularizing tendencies of modern Western society (sometimes described as the \"Weber Thesis\") would blend with Marxism to facilitate critical theory, particularly in the work of thinkers such as Jürgen Habermas (born 1929). Critical theorists, as antipositivists, are critical of the idea of a hierarchy of sciences or societies, particularly with respect to the sociological positivism originally set forth by Comte. Jürgen Habermas has critiqued the concept of pure instrumental rationality as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to ideology itself. For theorists such as Zygmunt Bauman (1925-2017), rationalization as a manifestation of modernity may be most closely and regrettably associated with the events of the Holocaust.\n\nWhen the critique of classical social evolutionism became widely accepted, modern anthropological and sociological approaches changed respectively. Modern theories are careful to avoid unsourced, ethnocentric speculation, comparisons, or value judgments; more or less regarding individual societies as existing within their own historical contexts. These conditions provided the context for new theories such as cultural relativism and multilineal evolution.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Gordon Childe revolutionized the study of cultural evolutionism. He conducted a comprehensive pre-history account that provided scholars with evidence for African and Asian cultural transmission into Europe. He combated scientific racism by finding the tools and artifacts of the indigenous people from Africa and Asia and showed how they influenced the technology of European culture. Evidence from his excavations countered the idea of Aryan supremacy and superiority. Childe explained cultural evolution by his theory of divergence with modifications of convergence. He postulated that different cultures form separate methods that meet different needs, but when two cultures were in contact they developed similar adaptations, solving similar problems. Rejecting Spencer’s theory of parallel cultural evolution, Childe found that interactions between cultures contributed to the convergence of similar aspects most often attributed to one culture. Childe placed emphasis on human culture as a social construct rather than products of environmental or technological contexts. Childe coined the terms \"Neolithic Revolution\", and \"Urban Revolution\" which are still used today in the branch of pre-historic anthropology.\n\nIn 1941 anthropologist Robert Redfield wrote about a shift from ‘folk society’ to ‘urban society’. By the 1940s cultural anthropologists such as Leslie White and Julian Steward sought to revive an evolutionary model on a more scientific basis, and succeeded in establishing an approach known as neoevolutionism. White rejected the opposition between \"primitive\" and \"modern\" societies but did argue that societies could be distinguished based on the amount of energy they harnessed, and that increased energy allowed for greater social differentiation (White’s law). Steward on the other hand rejected the 19th-century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of \"adaptation\", arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way.\n\nThe anthropologists Marshall Sahlins and Elman Service prepared an edited volume, \"Evolution and Culture\", in which they attempted to synthesise White’s and Steward’s approaches. Other anthropologists, building on or responding to work by White and Steward, developed theories of cultural ecology and ecological anthropology. The most prominent examples are Peter Vayda and Roy Rappaport. By the late 1950s, students of Steward such as Eric Wolf and Sidney Mintz turned away from cultural ecology to Marxism, World Systems Theory, Dependency theory and Marvin Harris’s Cultural materialism.\n\nToday most anthropologists reject 19th-century notions of progress and the three assumptions of unilineal evolution. Following Steward, they take seriously the relationship between a culture and its environment to explain different aspects of a culture. But most modern cultural anthropologists have adopted a general systems approach, examining cultures as emergent systems and arguing that one must consider the whole social environment, which includes political and economic relations among cultures. As a result of simplistic notions of \"progressive evolution\", more modern, complex cultural evolution theories (such as Dual Inheritance Theory, discussed below) receive little attention in the social sciences, having given way in some cases to a series of more humanist approaches. Some reject the entirety of evolutionary thinking and look instead at historical contingencies, contacts with other cultures, and the operation of cultural symbol systems. In the area of development studies, authors such as Amartya Sen have developed an understanding of ‘development’ and ‘human flourishing’ that also question more simplistic notions of progress, while retaining much of their original inspiration.\n\nNeoevolutionism was the first in a series of modern multilineal evolution theories. It emerged in the 1930s and extensively developed in the period following the Second World War and was incorporated into both anthropology and sociology in the 1960s. It bases its theories on empirical evidence from areas of archaeology, palaeontology, and historiography and tries to eliminate any references to systems of values, be it moral or cultural, instead trying to remain objective and simply descriptive.\n\nWhile 19th-century evolutionism explained how culture develops by giving general principles of its evolutionary process, it was dismissed by the Historical Particularists as unscientific in the early 20th century. It was the neo-evolutionary thinkers who brought back evolutionary thought and developed it to be acceptable to contemporary anthropology.\n\nNeo-evolutionism discards many ideas of classical social evolutionism, namely that of social progress, so dominant in previous sociology evolution-related theories. Then neo-evolutionism discards the determinism argument and introduces probability, arguing that accidents and free will greatly affect the process of social evolution. It also supports counterfactual history—asking \"what if\" and considering different possible paths that social evolution may take or might have taken, and thus allows for the fact that various cultures may develop in different ways, some skipping entire stages others have passed through. Neo-evolutionism stresses the importance of empirical evidence. While 19th-century evolutionism used value judgments and assumptions for interpreting data, neo-evolutionism relies on measurable information for analysing the process of sociocultural evolution.\n\nLeslie White, author of \"The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome\" (1959), attempted to create a theory explaining the entire history of humanity. The most important factor in his theory is technology. \"Social systems are determined by technological systems\", wrote White in his book, echoing the earlier theory of Lewis Henry Morgan. He proposes a society’s energy consumption as a measure of its advancement. He differentiates between five stages of human development. In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use the energy of domesticated animals. In the third, they use the energy of plants (so White refers to agricultural revolution here). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness nuclear energy. White introduced a formula, P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilising the energy. This theory is similar to Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev’s later theory of the Kardashev scale.\n\nJulian Steward, author of \"Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution\" (1955, reprinted 1979), created the theory of \"multilinear\" evolution which examined the way in which societies adapted to their environment. This approach was more nuanced than White’s theory of \"unilinear evolution.\" Steward rejected the 19th-century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of \"adaptation\", arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way. He argued that different adaptations could be studied through the examination of the specific resources a society exploited, the technology the society relied on to exploit these resources, and the organization of human labour. He further argued that different environments and technologies would require different kinds of adaptations, and that as the resource base or technology changed, so too would a culture. In other words, cultures do not change according to some inner logic, but rather in terms of a changing relationship with a changing environment. Cultures therefore would not pass through the same stages in the same order as they changed—rather, they would change in varying ways and directions. He called his theory \"multilineal evolution\". He questioned the possibility of creating a social theory encompassing the entire evolution of humanity; however, he argued that anthropologists are not limited to describing specific existing cultures. He believed that it is possible to create theories analysing typical common culture, representative of specific eras or regions. As the decisive factors determining the development of given culture he pointed to technology and economics, but noted that there are secondary factors, like political system, ideologies and religion. All those factors push the evolution of a given society in several directions at the same time; hence the application of the term \"multilinear\" to his theory of evolution.\n\nMarshall Sahlins, co-editor with Elman Service of \"Evolution and Culture\" (1960), divided the evolution of societies into ‘general’ and ‘specific’. General evolution is the tendency of cultural and social systems to increase in complexity, organization and adaptiveness to environment. However, as the various cultures are not isolated, there is interaction and a diffusion of their qualities (like technological inventions). This leads cultures to develop in different ways (specific evolution), as various elements are introduced to them in different combinations and at different stages of evolution.\n\nIn his \"Power and Prestige\" (1966) and \"Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology\" (1974), Gerhard Lenski expands on the works of Leslie White and Lewis Henry Morgan, developing the ecological-evolutionary theory. He views technological progress as the most basic factor in the evolution of societies and cultures. Unlike White, who defined technology as the ability to create and utilise energy, Lenski focuses on information—its amount and uses. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of natural environment) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He distinguishes four stages of human development, based on advances in the history of communication. In the first stage, information is passed by genes. In the second, when humans gain sentience, they can learn and pass information through by experience. In the third, humans start using signs and develop logic. In the fourth, they can create symbols and develop language and writing. Advancements in the technology of communication translate into advancements in the economic system and political system, distribution of goods, social inequality and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication and economy: (1) hunters and gatherers, (2) agricultural, (3) industrial, and (4) special (like fishing societies).\n\nTalcott Parsons, author of \"Societies: Evolutionary and Comparative Perspectives\" (1966) and \"The System of Modern Societies\" (1971) divided evolution into four subprocesses: (1) division, which creates functional subsystems from the main system; (2) adaptation, where those systems evolve into more efficient versions; (3) inclusion of elements previously excluded from the given systems; and (4) generalization of values, increasing the legitimization of the ever more complex system. He shows those processes on 4 stages of evolution: (I) primitive or foraging, (II) archaic agricultural, (III) classical or \"historic\" in his terminology, using formalized and universalizing theories about reality and (IV) modern empirical cultures. However, these divisions in Parsons’ theory are the more formal ways in which the evolutionary process is conceptualized, and should not be mistaken for Parsons’ actual theory. Parsons develops a theory where he tries to reveal the complexity of the processes which take form between two points of necessity, the first being the cultural \"necessity,\" which is given through the values-system of each evolving community; the other is the environmental necessities, which most directly is reflected in the material realities of the basic production system and in the relative capacity of each industrial-economical level at each window of time. Generally, Parsons highlights that the dynamics and directions of these processes is shaped by the cultural imperative embodied in the cultural heritage, and more secondarily, an outcome of sheer \"economic\" conditions.\n\nMichel Foucault’s recent, and very much misunderstood, concepts such as Biopower, Biopolitics and Power-knowledge has been cited as breaking free from the traditional conception of man as cultural animal. Foucault regards both the terms “cultural animal” and \"human nature\"as misleading abstractions, leading to a non critical exemption of man and anything can be justified when regarding social processes or natural phenomena (social phenomena). Foucault argues these complex processes are interrelated, and difficult to study for a reason so those 'truths' cannot be topled or disrupted. For Foucault, the many modern concepts and practices that attempt to uncover “the truth” about human beings (either psychologically, sexually, religion or spiritually) actually create the very types of people they purport to discover. Requiring trained \"specialists\" and knowledge codes and know how, rigorous pursuit is \"put off\" or delayed which makes any kind of study not only a ‘taboo’ subject but deliberately ignored. He cites the concept of ‘truth’ within many human cultures and the ever flowing dynamics between truth, power, and knowledge as a resultant complex dynamics (Foucault uses the term regimes of truth) and how they flow with ease like water which make the concept of ‘truth’ impervious to any further rational investigation. Some of the West’s most powerful social institutions are powerful for a reason, not because they exhibit powerful structures which inhibit investigation or it is illegal to investigate there historical foundation. It is the very notion of \"legitimacy\" Foucault cites as examples of \"truth\" which function as a \"Foundationalism\" claims to historical accuracy. Foucault argues, systems such as Medicine, Prisons, and Religion, as well as groundbreaking works on more abstract theoretical issues of power are suspended or buried into oblivion. He cites as further examples the ‘Scientific study’ of Population biology and Population genetics as both examples of this kind of “Biopower” over the vast majority of the human population giving the new founded political population their ‘politics’ or polity. With the advent of biology and genetics teamed together as new scientific innovations notions of study of knowledge regarding truth belong to the realm of experts who will never divulge their secrets openly, while the bulk of the population do not know their own biology or genetics this is done for them by the experts.\nThis functions as a truth ignorance mechanism: “where the “subjugated knowledge’s,” as those that have been both written out of history and submerged in it in a masked form produces what we now know as truth. He calls them “Knowledge’s from below” and a “historical knowledge of struggles”.Genealogy, Foucault suggests, is a way of getting at these knowledge’s and struggles; “they are about the insurrection of knowledge’s.”Foucault tries to show with the added dimension of “Milieu”(derived from Newtonian mechanics) how this Milieu from the 17th century with the development of the Biological and Physical sciences managed to be interwoven into the political, social and biological relationship of men with the arrival of the concept Work placed upon the industrial population. Foucault uses the term borrowed from Jakob von Uexküll\nUmwelt meaning environment within.\nTechnology, production, Cartography the production of Nation states and Government making the efficiency of the Body politic, Law, Heredity and Consanguine not only sound genuine and beyond historical origin and foundation it can be turned into ‘exact truth’ where the individual and the societal body are not only subjugated and nullified but dependent upon it. Foucault is not denying that genetic or biological study is inaccurate or is simply not telling the truth what he means is that notions of this newly discovered sciences were extended to include the vast majority (or whole populations) of populations as an exercise in “regimes change”.Foucault argues that the conceptual meaning from the Middle ages and Canon law period, the Geocentric model, later superseded by the Heliocentrism model placing the position of the law of right in the Middle ages (Exclusive right or its correct legal term \"Sui generis\") was the Divine right of kings and Absolute monarchy where the previous incarnation of truth and rule of political sovereignty was considered absolute and unquestioned by Political Philosophy(monarchs, popes and emperors). However, Foucault notices that this Pharaonic version of Political power was transversed and it was with 18th-century emergence of Capitalism and Liberal democracy that these terms began to be “democratized”.The modern Pharaonic version represented by the President, the monarch, the Pope and the Prime minister all became propagandized versions or examples of symbol agents all aimed at towards a newly discovered phenomenon, the population. As symbolic symbol agents of power making the mass population having to sacrifice itself all in the name of the newly formed voting franchise we now call Democracy. However, this was all turned on its head (when the Medieval rulers were thrown out and replaced by a more exact apparatus now called the state) when the human sciences suddenly discovered: “The set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became an object of a political strategy and took on board the fundamental facts that humans were now a biological species.\"\n\nSociobiology departs perhaps the furthest from classical social evolutionism. It was introduced by Edward Wilson in his 1975 book \"\" and followed his adaptation of evolutionary theory to the field of social sciences. Wilson pioneered the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviours such as altruism, aggression, and nurturance. In doing so, Wilson sparked one of the greatest scientific controversies of the 20th century.\n\nThe current theory of evolution, the modern evolutionary synthesis (or neo-darwinism), explains that evolution of species occurs through a combination of Darwin’s mechanism of natural selection and Gregor Mendel’s theory of genetics as the basis for biological inheritance and mathematical population genetics. Essentially, the modern synthesis introduced the connection between two important discoveries; the units of evolution (genes) with the main mechanism of evolution (selection).\n\nDue to its close reliance on biology, sociobiology is often considered a branch of the biology, although it uses techniques from a plethora of sciences, including ethology, evolution, zoology, archaeology, population genetics, and many others. Within the study of human societies, sociobiology is closely related to the fields of human behavioral ecology and evolutionary psychology.\n\nSociobiology has remained highly controversial as it contends genes explain specific human behaviours, although sociobiologists describe this role as a very complex and often unpredictable interaction between nature and nurture. The most notable critics of the view that genes play a direct role in human behaviour have been biologists Richard Lewontin Steven Rose and Stephen Jay Gould.\n\nSince the rise of evolutionary psychology, another school of thought, Dual Inheritance Theory, has emerged in the past 25 years that applies the mathematical standards of Population genetics to modeling the adaptive and selective principles of culture. This school of thought was pioneered by Robert Boyd at UCLA and Peter Richerson at UC Davis and expanded by William Wimsatt, among others. Boyd and Richerson’s book, \"Culture and the Evolutionary Process\" (1985), was a highly mathematical description of cultural change, later published in a more accessible form in \"Not by Genes Alone\" (2004). In Boyd and Richerson’s view, cultural evolution, operating on socially learned information, exists on a separate but co-evolutionary track from genetic evolution, and while the two are related, cultural evolution is more dynamic, rapid, and influential on human society than genetic evolution. Dual Inheritance Theory has the benefit of providing unifying territory for a \"nature and nurture\" paradigm and accounts for more accurate phenomenon in evolutionary theory applied to culture, such as randomness effects (drift), concentration dependency, \"fidelity\" of evolving information systems, and lateral transmission through communication.\n\nTheories of modernization have been developed and popularized in 1950s and 1960s and are closely related to the dependency theory and development theory. They combine the previous theories of sociocultural evolution with practical experiences and empirical research, especially those from the era of decolonization. The theory states that:\nDeveloping from classical social evolutionism theories, the theory of modernization stresses the modernization factor: many societies are simply trying (or need) to emulate the most successful societies and cultures. It also states that it is possible to do so, thus supporting the concepts of social engineering and that the developed countries can and should help those less developed, directly or indirectly.\n\nAmong the scientists who contributed much to this theory are Walt Rostow, who in his \"The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto\" (1960) concentrates on the economic system side of the modernization, trying to show factors needed for a country to reach the path to modernization in his Rostovian take-off model. David Apter concentrated on the political system and history of democracy, researching the connection between democracy, good governance and efficiency and modernization. David McClelland (\"The Achieving Society\", 1967) approached this subject from the psychological perspective, with his motivations theory, arguing that modernization cannot happen until given society values innovation, success and free enterprise. Alex Inkeles (\"Becoming Modern\", 1974) similarly creates a model of \"modern personality\", which needs to be independent, active, interested in public policies and cultural matters, open to new experiences, rational and able to create long-term plans for the future. Some works of Jürgen Habermas are also connected with this subfield.\n\nThe theory of modernization has been subject to some criticism similar to that levied against classical social evolutionism, especially for being too ethnocentric, one-sided and focused on the Western world and its culture.\n\nCultural evolution follows punctuated equilibrium which Gould and Eldredge developed for biological evolution. Bloomfield has written that human societies follow punctuated equilibrium which would mean first, a stable society, and then a transition resulting in a subsequent stable society with greater complexity. This model would claim mankind has had a stable animal society, a transition to a stable tribal society, another transition to a stable peasant society and is currently in a transitional industrial society.\n\nThe status of a human society rests on the productivity of food production. Deevey reported on the growth of the number of humans. Deevey also reported on the productivity of food production, noting that productivity changes very little for stable societies, but increases during transitions. When productivity and especially food productivity can no longer be increased, Bloomfield has proposed that man will have achieved a stable automated society. Space is also assumed to allow for the continued growth of the human population, as well as providing a solution to the current pollution problem by providing limitless energy from solar satellite power stations.\n\nThe Cold War period was marked by rivalry between two superpowers, both of which considered themselves to be the most highly evolved cultures on the planet. The USSR painted itself as a socialist society which emerged from class struggle, destined to reach the state of communism, while sociologists in the United States (such as Talcott Parsons) argued that the freedom and prosperity of the United States were a proof of a higher level of sociocultural evolution of its culture and society. At the same time, decolonization created newly independent countries who sought to become more developed—a model of progress and industrialization which was itself a form of sociocultural evolution.\n\nThere is, however, a tradition in European social theory from Rousseau to Max Weber arguing that this progression coincides with a loss of human freedom and dignity. At the height of the Cold War, this tradition merged with an interest in ecology to influence an activist culture in the 1960s. This movement produced a variety of political and philosophical programs which emphasized the importance of bringing society and the environment into harmony.\n\nMany argue that the next stage of sociocultural evolution consists of a merger with technology, especially information processing technology. Several cumulative major transitions of evolution have transformed life through key innovations in information storage and replication, including RNA, DNA, multicellularity, and also language and culture as inter-human information processing systems. in this sense it can be argued that the carbon-based biosphere has generated a cognitive system (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable evolutionary\ntransition. \"Digital information has reached a similar magnitude to information in the biosphere. It increases exponentially, exhibits high-fidelity replication, evolves through differential fitness, is expressed through artificial intelligence (AI), and has facility for virtually limitless recombination. Like previous\nevolutionary transitions, the potential symbiosis between biological and digital information will reach a critical point where these codes could compete via natural\nselection. Alternatively, this fusion could create a higher-level superorganism employing a low-conflict division of labor in performing informational tasks...humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels, ...most transactions on the stock market are executed by automated trading algorithms, and our electric grids are in the hands of artificial intelligence. With one in three marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction\".\n\nCurrent political theories of the new tribalists consciously mimic ecology and the life-ways of indigenous peoples, augmenting them with modern sciences. Ecoregional Democracy attempts to confine the \"shifting groups\", or tribes, within \"more or less clear boundaries\" that a society inherits from the surrounding ecology, to the borders of a naturally occurring ecoregion. Progress can proceed by competition between but not within tribes, and it is limited by ecological borders or by Natural Capitalism incentives which attempt to mimic the pressure of natural selection on a human society by forcing it to adapt consciously to scarce energy or materials. Gaians argue that societies evolve deterministically to play a role in the ecology of their biosphere, or else die off as failures due to competition from more efficient societies exploiting nature's leverage.\n\nThus, some have appealed to theories of sociocultural evolution to assert that optimizing the ecology and the social harmony of closely knit groups is more desirable or necessary than the progression to \"civilization.\" A 2002 poll of experts on Neoarctic and Neotropic indigenous peoples (reported in \"Harper's\" magazine)[citation needed] revealed that \"all of them\" would have preferred to be a typical New World person in the year 1491, prior to any European contact, rather than a typical European of that time. This approach has been criticised by pointing out that there are a number of historical examples of indigenous peoples doing severe environmental damage (such as the deforestation of Easter Island and the extinction of mammoths in North America) and that proponents of the goal have been trapped by the European stereotype of the noble savage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13111274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13111274", "title": "Stonehenge Riverside Project", "text": "Stonehenge Riverside Project\n\nThe Stonehenge Riverside Project was a major Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded archaeological research study of the development of the Stonehenge landscape in Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain. In particular, the project examined the relationship between the Stones and surrounding monuments and features including the River Avon, Durrington Walls, the Cursus, the Avenue, Woodhenge, burial mounds, and nearby standing stones. The project involved a substantial amount of fieldwork and ran from 2003 to 2009. It found that Stonehenge was built 500 years earlier than previously thought and was built to unify the peoples of Britain. It also found a new stone circle, Bluestonehenge.\n\nThe project was directed by Mike Parker Pearson (Sheffield University), Julian Thomas (Manchester University), Colin Richards (Manchester University), Kate Welham (Bournemouth University), Joshua Pollard (University of Southampton) and Chris Tilley (University College London). The main aims of the project were to test the hypotheses of earlier studies that Stonehenge was a monument dedicated to the dead, whilst Woodhenge & Durrington Walls, two miles away, were monuments to the living and more recently deceased.\n\nThe area immediately inside Stonehenge Bowl has been excavated several times throughout history, but to the east around Durrington Walls there have only been two major studies conducted within recent times. The first was between 1926 and 1929 when Maud Cunnington excavated around Woodhenge, discovering several Neolithic and Bronze Age features to the south. Later, when the nearby A345 was improved and routed through Durrington Walls in 1967, two timber circles were discovered within the henge. Also discovered were vast amounts of animal bones and associated Neolithic pottery and tools.\n\n2003 fieldwork involved sampling and geophysical surveys of the land around Durrington Walls in preparation for future study. This work helped identify two previously unrecognised entranceways to the henge, to the North and South.\n\n2004 marked the start of annual excavations in the Stonehenge landscape. Trenches were dug on the riverbank of the River Avon next to Durrington Walls, and at the eastern entrance to the henge. On this occasion various finds suggesting neolithic occupation were found around the area.\n\nMore fieldwork was carried out in the summer of 2005. Excavations were made around the land east of Durrington Walls near the river, and north west outside the west gate. A large amount of digging was done on the eastern banks of the henge, and inside the walls to expose the southernmost timber circle discovered in 1967. A great deal of work was also carried out 2 miles east, around a fallen sarsen stone known locally as the Bulford stone. Channel 4's archaeological television programme \"Time Team\" attended and built a temporary reconstruction of the timber circle in the nearby village of Upavon.\n\nOver 20 researchers and 170 students and volunteers were involved in excavations around the Durrington Walls and investigations into the Stonehenge landscape. Among other things, new dating suggested that the Sarsen phase of Stonehenge was contemporary with Durrington Walls at around 2640-2480 BC.\n\nIn late summer of 2007, four weeks of fieldwork was carried out by several hundred students and volunteers. Excavations were carried out at the western end of the Cursus; around the southern, western and eastern gates of Durrington Walls; at the site of Maud Cunnington's digs immediately south of Woodhenge; and around another nearby fallen sarsen stone, known locally as the Cuckoo Stone. Geophysical surveys were also carried out across much of the surrounding area and around Stonehenge Bowl. Residencies for six artists and two graduate art student placements were arranged by Artists in Archaeology to record the processes of uncovering and interpreting this location.\n\nIn the late summer of 2008, a further four weeks of excavations were carried out. The year's excavation focused largely upon the Avenue, largely re-excavating work by Richard Atkinson. More work was carried out upon the Eastern end of the Stonehenge Cursus, Long Barrow 42 (which is at the eastern terminal of the Cursus), the field to the west of Stonehenge, and a re-excavation of one of the Aubrey Holes within the stonehenge bowl. The excavation was covered by \"Time Team\" but was also covered by \"Nova\" and \"National Geographic\". Residencies for six visual artists were arranged by Artists in Archaeology, to explore connections between archaeological processes and artistic practices.\n\nIn 2008, and again in 2009, the team excavated the remains of a henge beside the river, about south-east of Stonehenge. The discovery attracted media coverage and the name \"Bluehenge\" or \"Bluestonehenge\".\n\nStonehenge is effectively Britain's largest third millennium BC cemetery, containing 52 cremation burials and many other fragments of both burnt and unburnt bone. Many of the cremation deposits contained more than one individual, so that an estimate of the number of people buried here during that period may be between 150 and 240. In 2007 the Stonehenge Riverside Project and the Beaker People Project jointly embarked upon a radiocarbon dating programme of the surviving skeletal remains to establish when Stonehenge was used as a burial space. As a result of this, it is argued that the site began as a cremation cemetery in the early third millennium BC.\n\nThe research concluded that stonehenge was built to unify the people of Stone Age Britain.\nThe result were published in a 2012 book \"Stonehenge, Exploring the greatest Stone Age mystery\" by Mike Parker Pearson.\n\n"}
{"id": "2610498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2610498", "title": "Studio pottery", "text": "Studio pottery\n\nStudio pottery is pottery made by professional and amateur artists or artisans working alone or in small groups, making unique items or short runs. Typically, all stages of manufacture are carried out by the artists themselves. Studio pottery includes functional wares such as tableware and cookware, and non-functional wares such as sculpture. Studio potters can be referred to as ceramic artists, ceramists, ceramicists or as an artist who uses clay as a medium. Much studio pottery is tableware or cookware, but an increasing number of studio potters produce non-functional (sometimes called decorative) or sculptural items. In Britain since the 1980s, there has been a distinct trend away from functional pottery, for example, the work of artist Grayson Perry. Some studio potters now prefer to call themselves ceramic artists, ceramists or simply artists. Studio pottery is represented by potters all over the world and has strong roots in Britain.\n\nSince the second half of the 20th century ceramics has become more highly valued in the art world. There are now several large exhibitions worldwide, including \"Collect and Origin\" (formerly the Chelsea crafts fair) in London, \"International Sculpture Objects & Functional Art Fair\" (SOFA) Chicago and \"International Sculpture Objects & Functional Art Fair \"(SOFA) New York City which includes ceramics as an art form. Ceramics have realized high prices, reaching several thousands of pounds for some pieces, in auctions houses such as Bonhams and Sotheby's.\n\nNotable studios included Brannam Pottery, Castle Hedingham Ware, Martin Brothers and Sir Edmund Harry Elton.\n\nSeveral influences contributed to the emergence of studio pottery in the early 20th century: art pottery (for example the work of the Martin Brothers and William Moorcroft); the Arts and Crafts movement, the Bauhaus; a rediscovery of traditional artisan pottery and the excavation of large quantities of Song pottery in China.\n\nLeading trends in British studio pottery in the 20th century are represented by Bernard Leach, William Staite Murray, Dora Billington, Lucie Rie and Hans Coper.\n\nOriginally trained as a fine artist, Bernard Leach (1887–1979) established a style of pottery, the ethical pot, strongly influenced by Chinese, Korean, Japanese and medieval English forms. After briefly experimenting with earthenware, he turned to stoneware fired to high temperatures in large oil- or wood-burning kilns. This style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th century. Leach's influence was disseminated by his writings, in particular \"A Potter's Book\" and the apprentice system he ran at his pottery in St Ives, Cornwall, through which many notable studio potters passed. \"A Potter's Book\" espoused an anti-industrial, Arts and Crafts ethos, which persists in British studio pottery. Leach taught intermittently at Dartington Hall, Devon from the 1930s.\n\nOther ceramic artists exerted an influence through their positions in art schools. William Staite Murray, who was head of the ceramics department of the Royal College of Art, treated his pots as works of art, exhibiting them with titles in galleries. Dora Billington (1890–1968) studied at Hanley School of Art, worked in the pottery industry and was latterly head of pottery at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. She worked in media that Leach did not, e.g. tin-glazed earthenware, and influenced potters such as William Newland, James Tower, Margaret Hine,Nicholas Vergette and Alan Caiger-Smith.\n\nLucie Rie (1902–1995) came to London in 1938 as a refugee from Austria. She had studied at the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule and has been regarded as essentially a modernist. Rie experimented and produced new glaze effects. She was a friend of Leach and was greatly impressed by his approach, especially about the \"completeness\" of a pot. The bowls and bottles which she specialised in are finely potted and sometimes brightly coloured. She taught at Camberwell College of Arts from 1960 until 1972.\n\nHans Coper (1920–1981), also a refugee, worked with Rie before moving to a studio in Hertfordshire. His work is non-functional, sculptural and unglazed. He was commissioned to produce large ceramic candlesticks for Coventry Cathedral in the early 1960s. He taught at Camberwell College of Arts from 1960 to 1969, where he influenced Ewen Henderson. He taught at the Royal College of Art from 1966 to 1975, where his students included Elizabeth Fritsch, Alison Britton, Jacqui Poncelet, Carol McNicoll, Geoffrey Swindell, Jill Crowley and Glenys Barton, all of whom produce non-functional work.\n\nAfter the Second World War, studio pottery in Britain was encouraged by two forces: the wartime ban on decorating manufactured pottery and the modernist spirit of the Festival of Britain. Studio potters provided consumers with an alternative to plain industrial ceramics. Their simple, functional designs chimed in with the modernist ethos. Cranks restaurant, which opened in 1961, used Winchombe pottery throughout, which Tanya Harrod describes as \"handsome, functional with pastoral but up to date air\". Cranks represented the look of the period. Elizabeth David's food revolution of the post-war years was associated with a similar kitchen look and added to the demand for hand-made tableware.\n\nHarrod notes that several potteries were formed in response to this fifties boom. There was in turn a demand for potters trained in workshop practice and able to throw quickly. As this training was not offered by the art schools of the period, the Harrow Art School studio pottery diploma was created to fill the gap. According to Harrod, \"the production potter of the Harrow type had a good innings well into the seventies\", by which time the market for this style of pottery was falling away.\n\nFrom the 1960s onwards, a new generation of potters, influenced by Camberwell School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design including Ewen Henderson, Alison Britton, Elizabeth Fritsch, Gordon Baldwin, Ruth Duckworth and Ian Auld began to experiment\\abstract ceramic objects, varied surface and glaze effects to critical acclaim. Elizabeth Fritsch has work represented in major collections and museums worldwide.\n\nThe number of potters increased in the mid-1970s the Craft Potters Association had 147 members and by the mid-1990s it had 306.\n\nA representative body for studio pottery in the United Kingdom is the Craft Potters Association, which has a members’ showroom in Great Russell Street, London WC1, and publishes a journal, \"Ceramic Review\".\n\nPottery had been an integral part of the United States Arts and Crafts movement in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Charles Fergus Binns, who was the first director of the New York State School of Clay-Working and Ceramics at Alfred University, was an important influence. Some potters in the United States adopted the approach from emerging studio pottery movements in Britain and Japan. In addition, American folk pottery of the southeastern United States was seen as an American contribution to studio pottery. University programs at Ohio State University, under the direction of Arthur Eugene Baggs in 1928 and under Glen Lukens in 1936 at the University of Southern California, began training ceramic students in presenting clay ware as art. Baggs had been intimately involved in the Arts and Crafts movement at Marblehead Pottery and, during the 1930s, he revived interest in the salt glazing method for studio pottery.\n\nEuropean artists coming to the United States contributed to the public appreciation of pottery as art, and included Marguerite Wildenhain, Maija Grotell, Susi Singer and Gertrude and Otto Natzler.

Released at the onset of the Cold War era, the pamphlet was in line with rising fears that the Soviet Union would launch a nuclear attack against the United States, and outlined what to do in the event of an atomic attack.\n\nPublished in 1950 by the Government Printing Office, one year after the Soviet Union detonated their first atomic bomb, the booklet explains how to protect oneself, one's food and water supply, and one's home. It also covered how to prevent burns and what to do if exposed to radiation. Because much of the book is arranged around calculations of the effects of the relatively small fission weapons of the time (ca. 20 kilotons), much of the information could be viewed as out of date in terms of nuclear weapons, however the most numerous nuclear weapons in both the US & USSR/Russian arsenal are and remain approximately 100 kiloton in yield(e.g. W76 and Bulava) due to the flexibility that MIRVs offer. It was also published before studies of the effects of nuclear weapons on civilian areas had taken place. The U.S Strategic bombing survey had assessed the civilian response in Hiroshima and Nagasaki beginning as early as August–September 1945 and its report was \"Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved...\". Secondly, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission was active from 1946 to 1975 studying the effects of the two bombs on survivors in both cities and thus represented four years of post-bombing study at the time of publication.\n\nThe four pages in the center of the brochure (15, 16, 17, 18) were designed to be torn out.\n\"Remove this sheet and keep it with you until you've memorized it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
