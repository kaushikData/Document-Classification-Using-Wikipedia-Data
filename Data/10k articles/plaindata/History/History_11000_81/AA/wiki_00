{"id": "85342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85342", "title": "Coke (fuel)", "text": "Coke (fuel)\n\nCoke is a fuel with a high carbon content and few impurities, made by heating coal in the absence of air. It is the solid carbonaceous material derived from destructive distillation of low-ash and low-sulfur bituminous coal. Cokes made from coal are grey, hard, and porous. While coke can be formed naturally, the commonly used form is synthetic. The form known as petroleum coke, or pet coke, is derived from oil refinery coker units or other cracking processes.\n\nCoke is used in preparation of producer gas which is a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen (N). Producer gas is produced by passing air over red-hot coke. Coke is also used to manufacture water gas.\n\nHistorical sources dating to the 4th century describe the production of coke in ancient China. The Chinese first used coke for heating and cooking no later than the ninth century. By the first decades of the eleventh century, Chinese ironworkers in the Yellow River valley began to fuel their furnaces with coke, solving their fuel problem in that tree-sparse region.\n\nIn 1589, a patent was granted to Thomas Proctor and William Peterson for making iron and steel and melting lead with \"earth-coal, sea-coal, turf, and peat\". The patent contains a distinct allusion to the preparation of coal by \"cooking\". In 1590, a patent was granted to the Dean of York to \"purify pit-coal and free it from its offensive smell\". In 1620, a patent was granted to a company composed of William St. John and other knights, mentioning the use of coke in smelting ores and manufacturing metals. In 1627, a patent was granted to Sir John Hacket and Octavius de Strada for a method of rendering sea-coal and pit-coal as useful as charcoal for burning in houses, without offense by smell or smoke.\n\nIn 1603, Hugh Plat suggested that coal might be charred in a manner analogous to the way charcoal is produced from wood. This process was not employed until 1642, when coke was used for roasting malt in Derbyshire; previously, brewers had used wood, as uncoked coal cannot be used in brewing because its sulfurous fumes would impart a foul taste to the beer. It was considered an improvement in quality, and brought about an \"alteration which all England admired\"—the coke process allowed for a lighter roast of the malt, leading to the creation of what by the end of the 17th century was called pale ale.\n\nIn 1709, Abraham Darby I established a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron. Coke's superior crushing strength allowed blast furnaces to become taller and larger. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution. Before this time, iron-making used large quantities of charcoal, produced by burning wood. As the coppicing of forests became unable to meet the demand, the substitution of coke for charcoal became common in Great Britain, and coke was manufactured by burning coal in heaps on the ground so that only the outer layer burned, leaving the interior of the pile in a carbonized state. In the late 18th century, brick beehive ovens were developed, which allowed more control over the burning process.\n\nIn 1768, John Wilkinson built a more practical oven for converting coal into coke. Wilkinson improved the process by building the coal heaps around a low central chimney built of loose bricks and with openings for the combustion gases to enter, resulting in a higher yield of better coke. With greater skill in the firing, covering and quenching of the heaps, yields were increased from about 33% to 65% by the middle of the 19th century. The Scottish iron industry expanded rapidly in the second quarter of the 19th century, through the adoption of the hot-blast process in its coalfields.\n\nIn 1802, a battery of beehives was set up near Sheffield, to coke the Silkstone seam for use in crucible steel melting. By 1870, there were 14,000 beehive ovens in operation on the West Durham coalfields, capable of producing of coke. As a measure of the extent of the expansion of coke making, it has been estimated that the requirements of the iron industry were about a year in the early 1850s, whereas by 1880 the figure had risen to , of which about were produced in Durham county, in the South Wales coalfield, and in Yorkshire and Derbyshire.\n\nIn the first years of steam railway locomotives, coke was the normal fuel. This resulted from an early piece of environmental legislation; any proposed locomotive had to \"consume its own smoke\". This was not technically possible to achieve until the firebox arch came into use, but burning coke, with its low smoke emissions, was considered to meet the requirement. This rule was quietly dropped, and cheaper coal became the normal fuel, as railways gained acceptance among the public.\n\nIn the US, the first use of coke in an iron furnace occurred around 1817 at Isaac Meason's Plumsock puddling furnace and rolling mill in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. In the late 19th century, the coalfields of western Pennsylvania provided a rich source of raw material for coking. In 1885, the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company constructed the world's longest string of coke ovens in Walston, Pennsylvania, with 475 ovens over a length of 2 km (1.25 miles). Their output reached 22,000 tons per month. The Minersville Coke Ovens in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1905, the number of beehive ovens in the US skyrocketed from about 200 to almost 31,000, which produced nearly 18,000,000 tons of coke in the Pittsburgh area alone. One observer boasted that if loaded into a train, “the year's production would make up a train so long that the engine in front of it would go to San Francisco and come back to Connellsville before the caboose had gotten started out of the Connellsville yards!” The number of beehive ovens in Pittsburgh peaked in 1910 at almost 48,000.\n\nAlthough it made a top-quality fuel, coking poisoned the surrounding landscape. After 1900, the serious environmental damage of beehive coking attracted national notice, although the damage had plagued the district for decades. “The smoke and gas from some ovens destroy all vegetation around the small mining communities,” noted W. J. Lauck of the U.S. Immigration Commission in 1911. Passing through the region on train, University of Wisconsin president Charles van Hise saw “long rows of beehive ovens from which flame is bursting and dense clouds of smoke issuing, making the sky dark. By night the scene is rendered indescribably vivid by these numerous burning pits. The beehive ovens make the entire region of coke manufacture one of dulled sky: cheerless and unhealthful.\" \n\nVolatile constituents of the coal—including water, coal-gas, and coal-tar—are driven off by baking in an airless furnace or oven (kiln) at temperatures as high as but usually around . This fuses together the fixed carbon and residual ash. Some facilities have \"by-product\" coking ovens in which the volatile hydrocarbons are mainly used, after purification, in a separate combustion process to generate energy. Non by-product coking furnaces or coke furnaces (ovens) burn the hydrocarbon gases produced by the coke-making process to drive the carbonization process. This is an older method, but is still being used for new construction.\n\nBituminous coal must meet a set of criteria for use as coking coal, determined by particular coal assay techniques. These include moisture content, ash content, sulfur content, volatile content, tar, and plasticity. This blending is targeted at producing a coke of appropriate strength (generally measured by coke strength after reaction), while losing an appropriate amount of mass. Other blending considerations include ensuring the coke doesn't swell too much during production and destroy the coke oven through excessive wall pressures.\n\nThe greater the volatile matter in coal, the more by-product can be produced. It is generally considered that levels of 26–29% of volatile matter in the coal blend are good for coking purposes. Thus different types of coal are proportionally blended to reach acceptable levels of volatility before the coking process begins.\n\nCoking coal is different from thermal coal, but it differs not by the coal forming process. Coking coal has different macerals from thermal coal. Based on the ash percentage coking coal can be divided into various grades. These grades are:\nThe different macerals are related to source of material that compose the coal. However, the coke is of wildly varying strength and ash content and is generally considered unsellable except in some cases as a thermal product. As it has lost its volatile matter, it has lost the ability to be coked again.\n\nThe hearth\" process of coke-making, using lump coal, was akin to that of charcoal-burning; instead of a heap of prepared wood, covered with twigs, leaves and earth, there was a heap of coals, covered with coke dust. The hearth process continued to be used in many areas during the first half of the 19th century, but two events greatly lessened its importance. These were the invention of the hot blast in iron-smelting and the introduction of the beehive coke oven. The use of a blast of hot air, instead of cold air, in the smelting furnace was first introduced by Neilson in Scotland in 1828.\nThe hearth process of making coke from coal is a very lengthy process.\n\nA fire brick chamber shaped like a dome is used, commonly known as a beehive oven. It is typically wide and high. The roof has a hole for charging the coal or other kindling from the top. The discharging hole is provided in the circumference of the lower part of the wall. In a coke oven battery, a number of ovens are built in a row with common walls between neighboring ovens. A battery consisted of a great many ovens, sometimes hundreds, in a row.\n\nCoal is introduced from the top to produce an even layer of about deep. Air is supplied initially to ignite the coal. Carbonization starts and produces volatile matter, which burns inside the partially closed side door. Carbonization proceeds from top to bottom and is completed in two to three days. Heat is supplied by the burning volatile matter so no by-products are recovered. The exhaust gases are allowed to escape to the atmosphere. The hot coke is quenched with water and discharged, manually through the side door. The walls and roof retain enough heat to initiate carbonization of the next charge.\n\nWhen coal was burned in a coke oven, the impurities of the coal not already driven off as gases accumulated to form slag, which was effectively a conglomeration of the removed impurities. Since it was not the desired coke product, slag was initially nothing more than an unwanted by-product and was discarded. Later, however, it was found to have many beneficial uses and has since been used as an ingredient in brick-making, mixed cement, granule-covered shingles, and even as a fertilizer.\n\nPeople can be exposed to coke oven emissions in the workplace by inhalation, skin contact, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit for coke oven emissions exposure in the workplace as 0.150 mg/m benzene-soluble fraction over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2 mg/m benzene-soluble fraction over an 8-hour workday.\n\nCoke is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. The carbon monoxide produced by its combustion reduces iron oxide (hematite) in the production of the iron product. ( <chem id=\"2Fe2O3 + 3C \">2Fe2O3 + 3C -> 4Fe + 3CO2 </chem>)\n\nCoke is commonly used as fuel for blacksmithing.\n\nCoke was used in Australia in the 1960s and early 1970s for house heating.\n\nSince smoke-producing constituents are driven off during the coking of coal, coke forms a desirable fuel for stoves and furnaces in which conditions are not suitable for the complete burning of bituminous coal itself. Coke may be combusted producing little or no smoke, while bituminous coal would produce much smoke. Coke was widely used as a substitute for coal in domestic heating following the creation of smokeless zones in the United Kingdom.\n\nHighland Park distillery in Orkney roasts malted barley for use in their Scotch whisky in kilns burning a mixture of coke and peat.\n\nCoke may be used to make synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.\n\nWastewater from coking is highly toxic and carcinogenic. It contains phenolic, aromatic, heterocyclic, and polycyclic organics, and inorganics including cyanides, sulfides, ammonium and ammonia. Various methods for its treatment have been studied in recent years. The white rot fungus \"Phanerochaete chrysosporium\" can remove up to 80% of phenols from coking waste water.\n\nThe bulk specific gravity of coke is typically around 0.77. It is highly porous.\n\nThe most important properties of coke are ash and sulfur content, which are dependent on the coal used for production. Coke with less ash and sulfur content is highly priced on the market. Other important characteristics are the M10, M25, and M40 test crush indexes, which convey the strength of coke during transportation into the blast furnaces; depending on blast furnaces size, finely crushed coke pieces must not be allowed into the blast furnaces because they would impede the flow of gas through the charge of iron and coke. A related characteristic is the Coke Strength After Reaction (CSR) index; it represents coke's ability to withstand the violent conditions inside the blast furnace before turning into fine particles.\n\nThe water content in coke is practically zero at the end of the coking process, but it is often water quenched so that it can be transported to the blast furnaces. The porous structure of coke absorbs some water, usually 3–6% of its mass. In more modern coke plants an advanced method of coke cooling uses air quenching.\n\nBituminous coal must meet a set of criteria for use as coking coal, determined by particular coal assay techniques. See Section \"Production\".\n\nThe solid residue remaining from refinement of petroleum by the \"cracking\" process is also a form of coke. Petroleum coke has many uses besides being a fuel, such as the manufacture of dry cells and of electrolytic and welding electrodes.\n\nGas works manufacturing syngas also produce coke as an end product, called gas house coke.\n\nFluid coking is a process which converts heavy residual crude into lighter products such as naphtha, kerosene, heating oil, and hydrocarbon gases. The \"fluid\" term refers to the fact that solid coke particles behave as a fluid solid in the continuous fluid coking process versus the older batch delayed-coking process where a solid mass of coke builds up in the coke drum over time.\n"}

Normally, that entity is an individual, the despot, as in an autocracy, but societies which limit respect and power to specific groups have also been called despotic.\n\nColloquially, the word \"despot\" applies pejoratively to those who abuse their power and authority to oppress their populace, subjects, or subordinates. More specifically, the term often applies to a head of state or government. In this sense, it is similar to the pejorative connotations that are associated with the terms \"tyrant\" and \"dictator\".\n\nThe English dictionary defines despotism as \"the rule of a despot; the exercise of absolute authority.\"\n\nThe root \"despot\" comes from the Greek word \"despotes\", which means \"master\" or \"one with power.\" The term has been used to describe many rulers and governments throughout history. It connoted the absolute authority and power exercised by the Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt, signified nobility in Byzantine courts, designated the rulers of Byzantine vassal states, and acted as a title for Byzantine Emperors. In this and other Greek or Greek influenced contexts, the term was used as an honorific rather than as a pejorative.\n\nDue to its reflexive connotation throughout history, the word \"despot\" cannot be objectively defined. While \"despot\" is closely related to other Greek words like \"basileus\" and \"autokrator\", these connotations have also been used to describe a variety of rulers and governments throughout history, such as local chieftains, simple rulers, kings, and emperors.\n\nOf all the ancient Greeks, Aristotle was perhaps the most influential promoter of the concept of \"oriental despotism\". He passed this ideology to his student, Alexander the Great, who conquered Persia, which at the time was ruled by the \"despotic\" Darius III, the last king of the Achaemenid dynasty. Aristotle asserted that oriental despotism was not based on force, but on consent. Hence, fear could not be said to be its motivating force, but rather the servile nature of those enslaved, which would feed upon the power of the despot master. Within ancient Greek society, every Greek man was free and capable of holding office; both able to rule and be ruled. In contrast, among the barbarians, all were slaves by nature. Another difference Aristotle espoused was based on climates. He observed that the peoples of cold countries, especially those of Europe, were full of spirit but deficient in skill and intelligence, and that the peoples of Asia, although endowed with skill and intelligence, were deficient in spirit and hence were subjected to slavery. Possessing both spirit and intelligence, the Greeks were free to govern all other peoples.\nFor the historian Herodotus, it was the way of the Orient to be ruled by autocrats and, even though Oriental, the character faults of \"despots\" were no more pronounced than the ordinary man's, though given to much greater opportunity for indulgence. The story of \"Croesus of Lydia\" exemplifies this. Leading up to Alexander's expansion into Asia, most Greeks were repelled by the Oriental notion of a sun-king, and the divine law that Oriental societies accepted. Herodotus's version of history advocated a society where men became free when they consented lawfully to the social contract of their respective city-state.\n\nEdward Gibbon suggested that the increasing use of Oriental-style despotism by the Roman emperors was a major factor in the fall of the Roman Empire, particularly from the reign of Elagabalus:\n\nAs the attention of the new emperor was diverted by the most trifling amusements, he wasted many months in his luxurious progress from Syria to Italy, passed at Nicomedia his first winter after his victory, and deferred till the ensuing summer his triumphal entry into the capital. A faithful picture, however, which preceded his arrival, and was placed by his immediate order over the altar of Victory in the senate-house, conveyed to the Romans the just but unworthy resemblance of his person and manners. He was drawn in his sacerdotal robes of silk and gold, after the loose flowing fashion of the Medes and Phoenicians; his head was covered with a lofty tiara, his numerous collars and bracelets were adorned with gems of an inestimable value. His eyebrows were tinged with black, and his cheeks painted with an artificial red and white. The grave senators confessed with a sigh, that, after having long experienced the stern tyranny of their own countrymen, Rome was at length humbled beneath the effeminate luxury of Oriental despotism. (\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\", Book One, Chapter Six)\n\nIn its classical form, despotism is a state in which a single individual (the \"despot\") holds all the power and authority embodying the state, and everyone else is a subsidiary person. This form of despotism was common in the first forms of statehood and civilization; the Pharaoh of Egypt is an exemplary figure of the classical despot.\n\nThe word itself seems to have been coined by the opponents of Louis XIV of France in the 1690s, who applied the term \"despotisme\" to describe their monarch's somewhat free exercise of power. The word is ultimately Greek in origin, and in ancient Greek usage, a despot (\"despótès\") was technically a master who ruled in a household over those who were slaves or servants by nature.\n\nThe term now implies tyrannical rule. Despotism can mean tyranny (dominance through threat of punishment and violence), absolutism, or dictatorship (a form of government in which the ruler is an absolute dictator, not restricted by a constitution, laws, or opposition, etc.)\n\nHowever, in enlightened absolutism (also known as benevolent despotism), which came to prominence in 18th century Europe, absolute monarchs used their authority to institute a number of reforms in the political systems and societies of their countries. This movement was quite probably triggered by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nThe Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu believed that despotism was an appropriate government for large states. Likewise, he believed that republics were suitable for small states and that monarchies were ideal for moderate-sized states.\n\nAlthough the word has a pejorative meaning nowadays, it was once a legitimate title of office in the Byzantine Empire. Just as the word \"Byzantine\" is often used in a pejorative way, so the word \"despot\" now has equally negative connotations. In fact, Despot was an Imperial title, first used under Manuel I Komnenos (1143–1180) who created it for his appointed heir Alexius-Béla. According to Gyula Moravcsik, this title was a simple translation of Béla's Hungarian title \"úr\", but other historians believe it comes from the ancient Greek \"despotes\" (literally, \"the master\"). In the Orthodox Liturgy, if celebrated in Greek, the priest is addressed by the deacon as Despot even today.\n\nIt was typically bestowed on sons-in-law and later sons of the Emperor and, beginning in the 13th century, it was bestowed to foreign princes. The Despot wore elaborate costumes similar to the Emperor's and had many privileges. Despots ruled over parts of the empire called Despotates.\n\nThe United States Declaration of Independence accused the British government of \"a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinc[ing] a design to reduce [the people] under absolute Despotism\".\n\nAccording to Montesquieu, the difference between absolute monarchy and despotism is that in the case of the monarchy, a single person governs with absolute power by fixed and established laws, whereas a despot governs by his or her own will and caprice.\n"}

University professor and a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, he authored several fundamental works on medieval Croatian literature and culture.\n\nHercigonja was born in Croatia's capital Zagreb in 1929. After finishing primary and secondary school in Sisak, he received a degree in Slavic studies at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Zagreb. He received his Ph.D. in 1970 with the thesis \"Jezik glagoljaške neliturgijske književnosti 15. stoljeća i Petrisov zbornik \" ('Language of the Glagolitic non-liturgical literature and Petris' miscellany'). He was elected as a docent in 1970, as an associate professor in 1974, becoming a full professor in 1977. Since 1968 he has served as a head of the Chair for the Old Church Slavonic language at the Department for Croatian Studies. Since 1977 he has been an associate, and since 1986 a full member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\nHercoginja's research interest focuses on Croatian Middle Ages. His \"Srednjovjekovna književnost\" ('Medieval literature') in »Liber's« edition \"Povijest hrvatske književnosti\" ('The history of Croatian literature'; Volume II, Zagreb 1975), based on extensive textological, linguistic and historical research of Glagolitic heritage, has managed to paint a different picture of medieval Croatian texts as what used to be called a 'precursor of literature' (A. Cronia).\n\nIn a series of analytical papers he warns of Čakavian-Kajkavian (and also Old Church Slavonic) interference in Glagolitic manuscripts as a result of conscious and deliberate effort of medieval writers to expand the area of influence of their works. Some of the papers, as well as discussions on stylemastics, orthography, language, education, socio-economic situation and the potentials of Croatian Glagolites and their treatment in the historical accounts of Croatian literature, have been compiled in a book \"Nad iskonom hrvatske knjige\" (1986).\n\nAs a researcher he always advocated a theory of the unity of Croatian medieval literature, despite its polyscriptal nature and dialectal diversity. This way he helped to provide a different perspective at the relationship of the Croatian Latinate literature, and that written in Croatian idioms. In the catalog of the exhibition \"Pisana riječ u Hrvatskoj\" (Muzejski prostor, Zagreb 1986) he published a study of three-script and three-lingual culture of the Croatian Middle Ages, which served as a basis of the book by the same name. In 1994 Matica hrvatska published his \"Tropismena i trojezična kultura hrvatskoga srednjovjekovlja\" conceived as an account of the most relevant facts from the 9th century Trpimir's inscription up to the 15th century first printed Croatian book (Missale Romanum Glagolitice). His 2004 book \"Na temeljima hrvatske književne kulture: filološko medievističke rasprave\", also published by Matica, represents a compilation of author's 50 years of scientific work and study of Croatian literature since the Middle Ages till the 18th century.\n\nFor his work he received state awards (1975 and 1983), and the Zagreb City Award (1975).

He made 14 Arctic and three Antarctic voyages in his lifetime. These expeditions (ca. 1875–1919) commonly began in New London, Connecticut or New Bedford, Massachusetts. Comer's circle of friends and colleagues included other notable explorers of the time, such as Robert Peary and Capt. Frederick Cook, and his mentor, Franz Boas, the \"Father of American Anthropology\".\n\nComer was born in Quebec City, Quebec in 1858. His father was English, and his mother was Irish. The family immigrated to the United States in 1860 and Comer grew up in East Haddam, Connecticut. He attended school for only two years. After Comer's father was lost at sea, his mother couldn't support the children. Subsequently, Comer spent time in an orphanage and an East Haddam foster home.\nIn 1877, Comer (age 19), married Julia Chipman (age 20; born in Pennsylvania) and they made their home on Mount Parnassus Road in East Haddam. They had two children: \ndaughter, Nellie G. (born April 1878), and son, Thomas L. (April 1886 – 1930), a seaship officer.\n\nComer made the first of his Arctic voyages at age 17 on the whaler \"Nile\" bound for Cumberland Sound, Baffin Island in 1875. From 1889 to 1891, he made three cruises on the schooner \"Era\" to southeastern Baffin Island. These were followed by 15 months whaling on the \"Canton\" during 1893–1894.\n\nAfter 20 years of seafaring, Comer became captain of his first ship in 1895. From 1895–1912, Comer was the master on six whaling cruises to the Hudson Bay, including wintering in Roes Welcome Sound, on the \"Era\" (wrecked off Newfoundland in 1906) (Eber, 1989, pp. 25), and the \"A. T. Gifford\".\nWhile wintering in the Hudson Bay, Comer became acquainted with and concerned for the Aivilingmiut, Netsilingmiut, and Qaernermiut. Comer hired the Caribou Inuit men as whaling hands and they supplied caribou meat for his crew saving them from developing scurvy. The Inuit women made caribou clothing for Comer's men, vital for survival through Arctic winters. Comer photographed the Inuit on many occasions and for that he was given the Inuktitut name \"Angakkuq\" (meaning, \"the shaman\"), as the images were not a reality easily understood by the Inuit.\n\nComer developed a bond with an Aivilik woman named Niviatsianaq (or Nivisanaaq), referred to amongst Inuit as \"Shoofly Comer\". She was Comer's traveling companion on his ships for several years, bringing her son Oudlanak, referred to as \"John Ell\", who was rumored to be Comer's biological son, with her. Comer fathered at least one other child while in Hudson Bay with an Inuit woman named Ooktok, Laurent Pameolik (1911–?). Pameolik was adopted by Shoofly and the shaman Angutimarik after the death of his birth mother.\n\nIn 1906, New York City furrier F. N. Monjo purchased the \"Era\" and hired Capt. Comer as its captain, but Comer wrecked the vessel on the island of Miquelon, off Newfoundland, later that year. Comer then became captain of Monjo's next purchase, the schooner \"A. T. Gifford\", which he commanded from 1907 until 1912. This whaler operated out of New London, Connecticut, for the 1907 voyage and New Bedford, MA, for the 1910 voyage, hunting for whales and furs, and wintering at Cape Fullerton.\n\nHis 1907 Anthony Fiala expedition was chartered to establish supply bases in the Arctic in preparation for a second team who would attempt to the reach the North Pole. Comer retired from whaling in 1912.\n\nIn 1915, Comer served as ice master on the \"George B. Cluett\", chartered by the American Museum of Natural History to bring back Donald MacMillan's men from the Crocker Land Expedition at Etah, in northern Greenland. En route, the \"Cluett\" became ice trapped for two years, giving Comer opportunity to perform archaeological excavations at Mount Dundas (Umánaq, Uummannaq or Umanak), a hill near Pituffik, where he unearthed evidence of what is now referred to as the Thule people, ancestors of the Inuit. His find is called \"Comer's Midden\" as it included a kitchen-midden.\n\nComer's last Arctic trip occurred in 1919, in part as a farewell to his Inuit friends. It was a charter by Arctic explorer/ethnologist Christian Leden to study amongst the Inuit. But the schooner, the \"Finback\", grounded at Cape Fullerton and was lost. An investigation was made into the grounding, and the circumstances were found to be suspect. For Comer, the benefit of the accident was the time extension he had with his long-time Inuit friends.\n\nComer visited Antarctica on several sealing voyages, including: South Georgia (October 9, 1885 – February 11, 1886) and Kerguelen Island (November 24, 1887 – February 5, 1888).\n\nOn his third voyage, he was Second Mate on the American schooner, the \"Francis Alleyn\" that sealed at Gough Island (August 22, 1888 – January 23, 1889). Comer is noted as having written the first account of the island's endemic flightless moorhen, the species \"Gallinula comeri\", named after him. Comer wrote of them:\n\nThey cannot fly and only use their wings to help them in running ... They are quite plentiful and can be caught by hand. Could not get on a table three feet high. The bushes grow on the island up to about , and these birds are found as far up as the bushes grow ... Tip of bill bright yellow, scarlet between the eyes. Legs and feet yellow, with reddish spots.\n\nComer was highly regarded for his Arctic anthropology, ethnology, natural history, geography, and cartography work. Lacking formal training, Comer was mentored by anthropologist Franz Boas. In return, Comer provided Boas with information that was used by Boas's in his 1888 book, \"The Central Eskimo\".\nComer published papers in 1910 and 1913 in the \"Bulletin of the American Geographical Society of New York\" providing improved maps and charts of Southampton Island. In appreciation for his cartography, the government of Canada named the narrow strait around the bend of Roes Welcome Sound that separates northern Southampton Island from White Island \"Comer Strait\" () in his honor.\n\nComer also published notes in \"American Anthropologist\" (1923) about Southampton Island's isolated Sadlermiut who became extinct in 1902. Subsequent to their extinction, Comer attempted to repopulate Southampton Island at the exceedingly flat Cape Kendall on the island's western shore, northwest of the Bay of Gods Mercy, with Aivilik. Shoofly's only child, Oudlanak (\"John Ell\"), was the Aivilik group leader. However, within a year, the Aivilik moved to South Bay (an inner cove on the south side of Southampton Island) and they occasionally crossed to Repulse Bay went weather permitted.\n\nIn November 1903, Comer recorded Aivilingmiut and Qaernermiut songs on a phonograph while in northwestern Hudson Bay, notable as some of the earliest recorded voices of Inuit. Frozen in the ice at Cape Fullerton during the winters of 1910–1912, he made phonograph records of local Inuit, and preserved Adelaide Peninsula's Iluilirmiut folklore and legends. On board the \"Era\", Comer made plaster casts of their faces. The 300 masks can be found in museums in Germany, Canada, and New York. The Canadian Museum of Civilization bought a large collection of Comer's artifacts in 1913, including a group of animal ivories (fox, musk ox, narwhal, polar bear, wolf), most of which, if not all, were created by \"Harry\" Ippaktuq Tasseok (or Teseuke), Chief of the Aivilingmiut, and Comer's chief Inuit shipmate while wintering at Cape Fullerton. Commissioned by the American Museum of Natural History, Comer also collected Arctic and Antarctic animal skins, birds, bird's eggs, and geological specimens now at the museum's Comer Collection.\n\nComer retired in East Haddam, but he continued to send presents to his Inuit friends. He remained active, serving in the Connecticut State Legislature. He was in ill health in his latter years, and died in East Haddam in 1937 at the age 79.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43250358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43250358", "title": "Historiography of religion", "text": "Historiography of religion\n\nThe historiography of religion is how historians have studied religion in terms of themes, sources and conflicting ideas. Historians typically focus on one particular topic in the overall history of religions - in terms of geographical area or of theological tradition.\n\nHistorians for centuries focused on the theological developments of their own religious heritage. Social scientists in the 19th century took a strong interest in \"primitive\" and comparative religion. In the 20th century the field focused mostly on theology and on church organization and development. Since the 1970s the social history approach to religious behavior and belief has become important.\n\nJacob argues that there has been a dramatic shift in the historiography of the Reformation. Until the 1960s, historians focused their attention largely on the great leaders and theologians of the sixteenth century, especially Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli. Their ideas were studied in depth. However, the rise of the new social history in the 1960s look at history from the bottom up, not from the top down. Historians began to concentrate on the values, beliefs and behavior of the people at large. She finds, \"in contemporary scholarship, the Reformation is now seen as a vast cultural upheaval, a social and popular movement, textured and rich because of its diversity.\"\nNew approaches to the history of Christianity were introduced by Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886) and Philip Schaff (1819-92). They emphasized the need for more neutrality, with the goal of understanding history as it actually happened, rather than promoting or defending ones theological heritage. Von Ranke in 1843 finished his six‐volume \"German History in the Epoch of the Reformation\" then turned to a multivolume \" History of the Popes during the Last Four Centuries.\" Schaff, deeply schooled in the German tradition, relocated to the United States in 1844. His \"History of the Christian Church\" (7 vols., 1858–1890), set new standards for the American study of ecclesiastical history. He demonstrated how to integrate liturgical developments. He also introduced European scholars to American religion, arguing that American sectarianism, with all its faults, was preferable to European church-statism.\n\nPietism, originated in 18th century Germany and was emulated in neighboring countries. It had a major impact in England and North America, where it affected the Methodist movement and a series of revival outbursts known as the Great Awakening in the U.S. It involved an intense internal focus on sin and salvation through Christ, and in the form of evangelicalism, remains a powerful force in Protestantism into the 21st century. Pietism emphasize the value of revivals, leading to the born-again experience, and inspired its followers to set high moralistic standards for public behavior, as in such areas as opposition to alcohol and slavery.\n\nHistorians have explored in depth the impact of the new religious sentiments of the 18th and 19th century on the organizational behavior of laymen. The Protestants sponsored voluntary charitable and religious societies, including overseas missions throughout the empire, setting up Sunday Schools, founding charity schools, distributing Bibles and devotional literature, creating and emphasizing hymns and communal singing, and setting up revivals. A major result was the establishment of an international battle against slavery as an affront to Protestant morality.\n\nSocial scientists in the 19th century took a strong interest in comparative and \"primitive\" religion through the work of Max Müller, Edward Burnett Tylor, William Robertson Smith, James George Frazer, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Rudolf Otto.\n\nHartmut Lehmann argues that four basic themes dominated the history of Christianity during the 20th century: the rise of \"political religions,\" drastic technological changes, progressive secularization, and the impressive growth of Christian communities in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nAn important field of study has been secularization, or the steady decline in religious activity in historically Protestant countries of Europe.\n\nMuch recent research is focused on the dramatic expansion of Christian religions in the Third World. \nProtestant and Catholic religions, starting with the base in colonial powers in Europe , grew dramatically in the Third World in the 20th century, especially in Africa. For example, there are a far more Anglicans in Nigeria today, that in Great Britain. Missionaries especially from the United States promoted Mormon, Jehovah Witness, Seventh-day Adventist, and holiness and Pentecostal denominations to highly receptive audiences.\n\nThe historiography of Islam grew slowly in the 20th century, and since the 1980s has become a major project for scholars. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57975652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57975652", "title": "History of beliefs about the human body", "text": "History of beliefs about the human body\n\nThe human body has been subject of much debate. How people are defined, and what defined them - be it their anatomy or their energy or both - depends on culture and time. Culture not only defines how sex is perceived but also how gender is defined. Today gender, sex, and identity continue to be of much debate and change based on what place and people are being examined. \n\nThe early modern idea of the body was a cultural ideal, an understanding and approach to how the body works and what place that body has in the world. All cultural ideals of the body in the early modern period deal with deficiencies and disorders within a body, commonly told through a male ideal. Ideas of the body in the early modern period form the history of how bodies should be and how to correct the body when something has gone wrong. Therefore, early modern conceptions of the body were not biological as there was not a restrictive biological view of the human body as established by modern science. \n\nConceptions of the body are primarily either eastern, based in China and involving practices such as Traditional chinese medicine, or western, which follows the Greek traditions of science and is more closely related to modern science despite original anatomists and ideas of the body being just as unscientific as Chinese practices.\n\nIn Western historical research, scholars began investigating the cultural history of the human body in detail in the 1980s. The movement is particularly associated with the historian of medicine Roy Porter, whose 1991 article 'History of the Body' was a seminal study. 1995 saw the foundation of the journal \"Body and Society\", by which time the field of the history of the body was already extensive and diverse.\n\nPorter pointed out that Western historiography had previously assumed mind–body dualism (i.e. that the body is fundamentally separate from the mind or soul) and therefore that the cultural history of bodies as material objects had been overlooked: 'given the abundance of evidence available, we remain remarkably ignorant about how individuals and social groups have experienced, controlled, and projected their embodied selves. How have people made sense of the mysterious link between \"self\" and its extensions? How have they managed the body as an intermediary between self and society?' He emphasised that the history of the body is important to understanding histories of coercion and control, sex and gender, and other important but culturally varied aspects of human experience.\n\nAnother prominent voice in the field at the same time was Caroline Walker Bynum, whose 1988 \"Holy Feast and Holy Fast\" became a landmark study. Both Bynum and Porter noted that during the 1980s Western history of the body research drew on post-structuralist thought, such as Michel Foucault's ideas of biopolitics and biopower, which emphasised that state power is not abstract, but exercised through and over human bodies. But both expressed a concern that research was focusing too much on discourse about bodies, rather than on material bodies themselves. Drawing on Mikhail Bakhtin's 1965 \"Rabelais and His World\", they promoted a more materially orientated direction in the history of the body.\n\nThe Ebers Papyrus is an Egyptian medical text and is the oldest known record of the human body, dating back to 3000 BC. The Ebers Papyrus describes the body by physical examination and what can be felt. Clinical investigations such as the Pulse, percussion of the body, the recognition of diseased or disordered states.\n\n“If thou examinst a swelling of the covering of his belly’s horns above his pudenda (sex organs) then thou shalt place thy finger on it and examine his belly and knock on the fingers (percuss) if thou examinst his that has come out and has arisen by his cough. Then thou shalt say concerning it: it is a swelling of the covering of his belly. It is a disease which I will treat”.\n\nThe distinct medical tone focuses on what can be felt externally to infer the maladies of the body. The body was born in the correct state but could was falable and fixable with the correct intervention and feeling and using the senses to identify what has gone wrong. The Ebers Papyrus refers to many god-like and spiritual infestations of the body that could not be explained at the time. Despite the explanations for maladies by spiritual rational, the interventions described to investigate and see the body were distinctly disconnected for the spirit or life force of the body and was principally about what could be seen or touched.\n\nDescriptions of the exact placement of the heart within the body, the circulation of blood are in no doubt accurate as Egyptians practiced embalming their dead by removal of organs and placement of them in jars.\n\nGreek Philosophers separated the body and the energy of the body into separate but equal and interacting categories. Aristotle defined the energy by which gives the body it's movement as the soul. The soul and the body are therefore linked but can remain separate entities. This is in refutation of Dualists who view the body and mind as separate states and should be treated and examined differently and Materialists who view all parts of the body, even the soul as having a physical manifestation in the body. Aristotle finds the middle ground and accepts both of these views, that the soul has aspects that can't be felt by normal methods, and physical manifestations that can be felt. \"For even if one and being are spoken of in several ways, what is properly so spoken of is the actuality\" -Aristotle in DeAnima\nAristotle forms the idea of Hylomorphism, that the soul and the body are not capable of being split apart without destroying both in the process. Despite this idea of the body and the soul Aristotle viewed disorder in what could be seen and felt. He was a proponent of the humoral theory that classified disorder as imbalances of the 4 fluids of the body. Aristotle was unable to dissect humans but did so to many animals and was a early founder of comparative anatomy. Aristotle did contend quasi spiritual manifestations of the body principally through sexual distinctions. He wrote that the sex of humans:\n\n“is determined by the male principle already contained in the semen. If this is not strong enough, then the opposite must necessarily come into existence, and the opposite of man is woman.”\nAristotle clearly superimposed man as the more important figure in men and women but presents an almost Qi like representation of how sexes are defined. Aristotle presents it as a physical manifestation in semen, but in context to his descriptions of the soul and body it is not clear that he meant something physical.\n\nEuropean ideologies of the body define disorder as only things that can be touched or explored. If something could not be explored then intrusions into these areas were performed. Therefore the body in Greek and European cultures is defined as being ailed by something physical, something that can be found and altered to produce order. Judeo-Christian ideologies have heavily influenced the definitions of the body and its disorders and therefore the male body is often explained in place of the female body.\n\nA major intervention in the history of the body in the West was Thomas W. Laqueur's 1990 book \"Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud\". Laqueur argued that from the eighteenth century into the late twentieth, Western societies had generally thought of humans as having two fundamentally sexes, male and female. But Laqueur argued that from ancient times, the prevailing intellectual understanding of sex was that women were anatomically simply an inferior form of men. For example, Renaldus Columbus, writing about what he proposed as the discovery of the clitoris, stated that, \"like a penis, \"if you touch it, you will find it rendered a little harder and oblong to such a degree that it shows itself as a sort of male member.\" (There was much debate on the actual discovery of the clitoris between male European scientists and many claimed to have described it first: by dissecting the human body and writing down what was observed these European scientists could claim in their idea of the body that they had discovered or created new knowledge.) This one-sex model was seen as consistent, in Abrahamic thought, with the Genesis creation narrative, in which Eve is formed from Adam's rib.\n\nLaqueur's argument has been enormously influential on the history of the body in the West, and applied by historians to a range of societies outside Laqueur's original scope, such as medieval Iceland. However, scholars specialising in pre-eighteenth-century history have often been critical of the idea that the one-sex body really was dominant in everyday life, or even in intellectual circles.\n\nThe Vitruvian Man is a drawing by leonardo Divinci that depicts the European ideal of a man. The figure is extremely muscular and focuses on the exterior of the body, what can be see and felt. This was the standard of beauty of humans and continues to be the ideal body of European traditions. There is no Vitruvian women.\n\nEastern ideologies of the body explain what can be detected, not only felt and examined. This comes from the idea that there is not only what can be physically seen and touched but what can't be. Energy or more aptly the means by which your body can manifest itself in the world can't be seen but, was thought to be able to be detected. Definitions of the body and it's disorders therefore focus on physical manifestations of energy through the body. This is mostly seen in Chinese Traditional Medicine and has today been explained in physical ways by modern science. The ideal body of east asian medical literature was not muscular and instead focused on key energy manifestations in the body for directed therapy.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor's Body is a term derived from the references to the Yellow Emperor within the Ancient Chinese book, the \"book of change\". The Term describes the references to both the physical body that can be touched, felt, and interact with the physical world, but also the sense of person and self that the body. The dualism of the body as both the physical self and the of subjective consciousness is how Chinese defined the body. The Yellow Emperor's body is a metaphor to describe a body that focuses on the individual and not the general, focusing on disorder as not just a physical malady.\n\nThe yellow emperor is revered in China and was the founder of acupuncture. The yellow emperor is said to of derived his medical practices from a conversation with a community physician. The manuscript is recorded in the Yellow Emperors Inner Cannon, and it being recorded in this way represents the attention to the individuals perspective in creating therapies like acupuncture to treat body ailments.\n\nThe Inner Cannon was revised by natural Philosophers of the time and the approved version of the Han Court and became a foundational text for the ideals and perceptions of the human body. It focused on Qi, Yin and Yang balance, and Five phase theory to explain health can disease.\n\nReferred to as the life force of the body, or the means by which the body is able to be animated. Qi is not limited to the physical but is intertwined with the cosmological. A tiny bit of qi, known as primordial qi is integrated in humans at birth. As one grows it is due to the primordial qi, as one fades it is becuase of the qi, and when one dies it is because their qi has been exhausted.\n\nThese are variations and representations of qi that define how a human exists in the world, a system of complementary opposites. Yin and Yang defined gender differences seen in the population. A baby born male simply had more Yang Qi energy where as a female has dominant Yin energy. Transgenderism, hermaphroditism and other variations of the body can be explained by the Yin and Yang Qi ideas of the body much better than the European counterparts.\n\nOther types of change in the world were classified by Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water. Applied to the body these 5 forces were the Liver, Heart, Spleen, Lung, and Kidney. These representations of the physical world in the body was understood dynamically and represents a deeper connection to the non animate objects and surroundings of a human. The body was not only physical sphere but a cosmological one interconnected to all physical and non physical quantities of life.\n\nThe clinician and patient encounter is a spiritual connection. It is not just about what is done but what is said and how it is said, how information is revealed and what information is not. Cheng Congzhou a physician in 1581 was a local doctor in Yangshou and documented his patient encounters in detail. The importance of not only qi but blood is seen in his records: Fang Shunian's mother, the scholar's Honored Lady,4 was sixty three years old. Her constitution was naturally weak and emaciated. Her qi and Blood were both depleted. Normally all her six pulses were extremely \"subtle\" and \"fine\"; even when she caught cold they did not become very \"big\" or \"pounding.\"The interactions of the physical body and the cosmological essence of a body was how disorders of the body was framed in this doctors account.\n\nThe practices surrounding a corpse differ widely among cultures. Diogenes is famously said to have wanted his lifeless body to be thrown to the wolves so that his body can return to nature. Cultural practices that revere the dead across all cultures reveal that even in European cultures that attempt to adhere purely to what can be seen and touched, recognize that there is a more cosmic necessity to the body and connection to the physical and cosmological worlds.\n"}

{"id": "2498045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2498045", "title": "Line shaft", "text": "Line shaft\n\nA line shaft is a power driven rotating shaft for power transmission that was used extensively from the Industrial Revolution until the early 20th century. Prior to the widespread use of electric motors small enough to be connected directly to each piece of machinery, line shafting was used to distribute power from a large central power source to machinery throughout a workshop or an industrial complex. The central power source could be a water wheel, turbine, windmill, animal power or a steam engine. Power was distributed from the shaft to the machinery by a system of belts, pulleys and gears known as \"millwork\".\n\nA typical line shaft would be suspended from the ceiling of one area and would run the length of that area. One pulley on the shaft would receive the power from a parent line shaft elsewhere in the building. The other pulleys would supply power to pulleys on each individual machine or to subsequent line shafts. In manufacturing where there were a large number of machines performing the same tasks, the design of the system was fairly regular and repeated. In other applications such as machine and wood shops where there was a variety of machines with different orientations and power requirements, the system would appear erratic and inconsistent with many different shafting directions and pulley sizes. Shafts were usually horizontal and overhead but occasionally were vertical and could be underground. Shafts were usually rigid steel, made up of several parts bolted together at flanges. The shafts were suspended by hangers with bearings at certain intervals of length. The distance depended on the weight of the shaft and the number of pulleys. The shafts had to be kept aligned or the stress would overheat the bearings and could break the shaft. The bearings were usually friction type and had to be kept lubricated. Pulley lubricator employees were required in order to ensure that the bearings did not freeze or malfunction.\n\nIn the earliest applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on grooved pulleys. This method is extremely rare today, dating mostly from the 18th century. Flat belts on flat pulleys or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or cotton duck impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning to keep them in good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.\n\nPulleys were constructed of wood, iron, steel or a combination thereof. Varying sizes of pulleys were used in conjunction to change the speed of rotation. For example a 40\" pulley at 100 rpm would turn a 20\" pulley at 200 rpm. Pulleys solidly attached (\"fast\") to the shaft could be combined with adjacent pulleys that turned freely (\"loose\") on the shaft (idlers). In this configuration the belt could be maneuvered onto the idler to stop power transmission or onto the solid pulley to convey the power. This arrangement was often used near machines to provide a means of shutting the machine off when not in use. Usually at the last belt feeding power to a machine, a pair of stepped pulleys could be used to give a variety of speed settings for the machine.\n\nOccasionally gears were used between shafts to change speed rather than belts and different sized pulleys, but this seems to have been relatively uncommon.\n\nEarly versions of line shafts date back into the 18th century, but they were in widespread use in the late 19th century with industrialization. Line shafts were widely used in manufacturing, woodworking shops, machine shops, saw mills and grist mills.\n\nIn 1828 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Paul Moody substituted leather belting for metal gearing to transfer power from the main shaft running from a water wheel. This innovation quickly spread in the U.S.\n\nFlat belt drive systems became popular in the UK from the 1870s, with the firms of J & E Wood and W & J Galloway & Sons prominent in their introduction. Both of these firms manufactured stationary steam engines and the continuing demand for more power and reliability could be met not merely by improved engine technology but also improved methods of transferring power from the engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. The use of flat belts was already common in the US but rare in Britain until this time. The advantages included less noise and less wasted energy in the friction losses inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, and it was a more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill. These systems were in turn superseded in popularity by rope drive methods.\n\nNear the end of the 19th century some factories had a mile or more of line shafts in a single building.\n\nIn order to provide power for small shops and light industry, specially constructed \"power buildings\" were constructed. Power buildings used a central steam engine and distributed power through line shafts to all the leased rooms. Power buildings continued to be built in the early days of electrification, still using line shafts but driven by an electric motor.\n\nAs some factories grew too large and complex to be powered by a single steam engine, a system of \"sub divided\" power came into use. This was also important when a wide range of speed control was necessary for a sensitive operation such as wire drawing or hammering iron. Under sub divided power, steam was piped from a central boiler to smaller steam engines located where needed. However, small steam engines were much less efficient than large ones. The Baldwin Locomotive Works 63 acre site changed to sub divided power, then because of the inefficiency converted to group drive with several large steam engines driving the line shafts. Eventually Baldwin converted to electric drive, with a substantial saving in labor and building space.\n\nWith factory electrification in the early 1900s, many line shafts began converting to electric drive. In early factory electrification only large motors were available, so new factories installed a large motor to drive line shafting and millwork. After 1900 smaller industrial motors became available and most new installations used individual electric drives.\n\nSteam turbine powered line shafts were commonly used to drive paper machines for speed control reasons until economical methods for precision electric motor speed control became available in the 1980s; since then many have been replaced with sectional electric drives. Economical variable speed control using electric motors was made possible by silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) to produce direct current and variable frequency drives using inverters to change DC back to AC at the frequency required for the desired speed.\n\nMost systems were out of service by the mid-20th century and relatively few remain in the 21st century, even fewer in their original location and configuration.\n\nCompared to individual electric motor or \"unit\" drive, line shafts have the following disadvantages: \n\nFirms switching to electric power showed significantly less employee sick time, and, using the same equipment, showed significant increases in production.\n\n“We can scarcely step into a shop or factory of any description without encountering a mass of belts which seem at first to monopolize every nook in the building and leave little or no room for anything else”.\n\nTo overcome the distance and friction limitations of line shafts, wire rope systems were developed in the late 19th century. Wire rope operated at higher velocities than line shafts and were a practical means of transmitting mechanical power for a distance of a few miles or kilometers. They used widely spaced, large diameter wheels and had much lower friction loss than line shafts, and had one-tenth the initial cost.\n\nTo supply small scale power that was impractical for individual steam engines, central station hydraulic systems were developed. Hydraulic power was used to operate cranes and other machinery in British ports and elsewhere in Europe. The largest hydraulic system was in London. Hydraulic power was used extensively in Bessemer steel production\n\nThere were also some central stations providing pneumatic power in the late 19th century.\n\nIn an early example, Jedediah Strutt's water-powered cotton mill, North Mill in Belper, built in 1776, all the power to operate the machinery came from an water wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1825524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825524", "title": "Nanyang (region)", "text": "Nanyang (region)\n\nNanyang () is a sinocentric Chinese term for the warmer and fertile geographical region south of China, otherwise known as the 'South Sea' or Southeast Asia. The term came into common usage in self-reference to the large ethnic Chinese migrant population in Southeast Asia, and is contrasted with \"Xiyang\" (), which refers to the Western world, and \"Dongyang\" (), which refers to Japan. The Chinese press regularly uses the term to refer to the region stretching from the Yunnan province to Singapore (in the south) and from India to Vietnam (in the west and east); in addition, the term also refers to Brunei, Malaysia (eastern part), Indonesia and the Philippines in the region it encompasses.\n\nThe alternative term, \"Great Golden Peninsula\", came into common usage due to the large number of Chinese migrants – attempting to escape the reach of the oppressive Manchu Emperors – it received. The Chinese, especially those from the southeastern seaboard, also ventured to the region to engage in trade. The Nanyang was extremely important in the trading business and one of China’s main trading partners in early years; it encompassed three main trading routes: one through Burma, one through Vietnam and lastly one through Laos.\n\nWaves of Chinese emigration from mainland China, also referred to as the Chinese diaspora, to The Great Golden Peninsula and other regions have occurred several times through the course of history. The first wave of emigration came as a result of the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, the ruling dynasty in China that followed the collapse of the Yuan dynasty and ruled for 276 years. The migrants opposed the Manchu seizure of power in Beijing and migrated to establish overseas Chinese communities throughout the Nanyang region. This led to Chinese control of large parts of the region’s economy and means of production.\n\nThe second wave started as a form of escaping the oppressive control exerted by the Manchu Emperors of the Qing dynasty, the last imperial dynasty of China ruling from 1644 to 1911. After the Taiping Rebellion and alternative upheavals that resulted in the disintegration of China, warlords ruptured the country into lawless fiefdoms, leading to an expansion of the Chinese communities in the Nanyang.\n\nThe Mekong River, gathering its strength in the Yunnan province and flowing south into the Nanyang nations of Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam before spilling into the South China Sea, was an extremely important facilitator of the Chinese Diaspora. It became known, not as a nourishing and life-giving river, but as the leading channel out of China for illegal migrants.\n\nMore recently, the third wave of migrants to the Nanyang – coming from all over China – has led to, arguably, more profound economic and social impacts than waves in the past. Better overland routes and air travel, along with the more relaxed Chinese emigration regulations of 1979 and China’s economic reform and opening up of its economy in 1980, have facilitated the process of migration and led the Chinese into a search for business opportunities in the Great Golden Peninsula.\n\nThe large Chinese communities created through migration led to Chinese social, economic and political influence over the Great Golden Peninsula. This influence has been a source of concern for many countries in that region. There is widespread fear that the Chinese are coming into Nanyang through the Indian Ocean giving them access to the Straits of Malacca – a major waterway for sea-borne trade and a very politically sensitive maritime region – which would allow Beijing a better basis for power projection, spreading its political views and expanding the communist ideas through the Nanyang.\n\nChina has also focused on encouraging the development of its outlying regions, both economically and in terms of security concerns. This allowed China to create symbiotic relationships with the adjacent territories and although it denies any accusations of power projection into the Nanyang region, its southward push causes many regional governments to feel uneasy.\n\nA particularly disconcerting relationship to the region is the Sino-Burmese relationship as Burma moves away from non-alignment. Myanmar's State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) has cultivated close ties with China due to its search for economic and military support. This has resulted in Myanmar being increasingly drawn into the Chinese sphere of influence. This relationship is unsettling since it can draw Myanmar away from a democratic path, while also allowing China easier access into the Indian Ocean; an important factor for Chinese power projection over the Nanyang region.\n\nThe third wave of migration, in particular, has helped Chinese influence to proliferate amongst its nearby neighbors. China has established close economic and military ties with both Myanmar and Laos. Its trade with Thailand is booming significantly and so are their political exchanges. China is Cambodia's closest foreign ally, and a growing source of aid, trade and migration for the country. Due to the large-scale migration of its people and the many countries in which Chinese have settled and exerted their influence, China has emerged as one of the most influential global powers.\n\nThe Great Golden Peninsula has benefitted greatly from Chinese immigration. Economic opportunity, commerce in particular, brought the Chinese to the Nanyang, and involvement in commercial activities is a common characteristic amongst Chinese minorities in the region. These Chinese family businesses and the Chinese population of the Nanyang can be characterized as the driving force behind economic growth and capitalism of the region.\n\nSince the period after 1850, the Chinese have come to dominate small business in the major cities of the Nanyang. They tended not only to own the shops, but hire mostly Chinese workers, increasing the scope and power of the Chinese influence. These business are distinguished by high level of centralization, most of the decision-making relies on the owner-manager; absence of bureaucratic regulation, yielding a fluid organizational structure; an autocratic and paternalistic leadership style; existence of preferential treatment combined with extensive family ties of obligation of duty; and finally, a customized network of external links. These features set them apart from other businesses in the Nanyang and allowed them to thrive due to the entrepreneurial talent they demonstrated.\n\nBecause the business industry for the Nanyang-Chinese seemed extremely prosperous, most of the Chinese immigrants strove to acquaint themselves with the shopkeepers and attempted to learn and eventually master trade in the hopes that they too would eventually gain entry to business in the Nanyang. This allowed for the continuation of business-creation by the Chinese arriving in the region.\n\nThe overseas Chinese of the Great Golden Peninsula play extremely significant roles in the region; in particular, involved with trade and commerce, mining and commercial agriculture. One of the main benefits the Chinese merchants brought to the Nanyang region is a more prominent relationship with the United States and other Pacific countries due to the strong link these merchants foster with foreign countries. The Nanyang Chinese continue to be vibrant elements in their newfound homes.\n\nDespite pogroms and discrimination against the Chinese in the Nanyang, especially where they constituted the minorities, the region still remains economically attractive to them. Pockets of settled Chinese communities continue to testify to the attractiveness of the Great Golden Peninsula.\n\nAlthough China has positive impacts in the Nanyang region, in more recent years (since the early 1980s), China’s continuous success with its open-door policy and export-oriented development strategy has started to cast a shadow on economies of the Great Golden Peninsula that must compete with China in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and in manufactured products to the same markets.\n\nChina's chief interest in the region of the Great Golden Peninsula was the expansion of its economic activities, namely trade. Foreign trade has been a very significant factor in maintaining stability and in contributing to growth in China. Chinese merchants were constantly pushing south as trade with Burma thrived. The Chinese province of Yunnan – where the Mekong River, previously used for illegal migration, flows - is China's main avenue for trade with the Nanyang. Yunnan is a landlocked province that possesses a well-developed industrial base with cheap labor and a fast-growing economy. Its proximity to the Nanyang region has been complemented by its remoteness from Beijing's control – the region was the last stronghold of anti-communist forces. It has for years sought a foreign market for its goods and an outlet to sea; due to the ideal conditions described above and its easy access to the Mekong River, it has begun gaining access to the several markets of the Nanyang, particularly Burma and Laos.\n\nAnother main avenue for Chinese trade with the Great Golden Peninsula is the South China Sea; it was the main route for trade in commodities and ideas, and even named the second Silk Route. Trade flows between China and the Nanyang were characterized by exports of manufactured or processed goods from China and exports of raw materials and food – particularly rice – from the Nanyang.\n\nMore recently, Singapore developed into the center of trade between the two regions; it became the base for Chinese activity in the Nanyang. Singapore was not only a main source of capital for overseas Chinese in the Nanyang but it also handled Chinese human cargo by ‘sorting’ it according to their skills and sturdiness.\n\nThe Nanyang region has been in the Chinese cultural sphere of influence for an extended period of time. Therefore, the rise in the role and influence of the ethnic Chinese is extremely important for the understanding of the region. The Chinese philosophy, religion, political philosophies, governmental standards and overall way of life have been transferred to the Great Golden Peninsula.\n\nOne of the many examples of China's influence over the region is the Chinese Lunar New Year, commonly referred to as “Chinese New Year”. It is celebrated and is an official public holiday in many countries of the Nanyang region (Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines). Another prominent example is the original roots of the people in the region; a significant portion of the population of the Nanyang region originated in China, especially when it comes to Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Singapore.\n\nMore specifically, Chinese influence in Thailand is seen in a rise in Thai-Chinese power, not only in commerce and business but also in politics, bureaucracy and intelligentsia. In Indonesia, some news bulletins are in Mandarin, whilst in Singapore, one of the four official languages is Mandarin. In the Philippines, Filipino-Chinese movies have won top prizes and 'chinovelas' are displayed on local television stations, with Hokkien being widely spoken by the local Chinese community. Vietnam has been following the 'China model' politically and economically; like in China, Vietnamese from overseas have led and been the most significant contributors of the economic recovery of the country. Malaysia experiences Chinese cultural influence through Chinese tycoons; they play a prominent role in leading the economic boom and inspire reforms to Malaysia’s Malay supremacy policy.\n\nThe anti-Chinese sentiment of the Nanyang has subsided in recent years as Chinese influence results in prosperous rather than communist results. This has generated amongst many Nanyang-Chinese the will to rediscover their cultural identity in line with the emerging China of the north. One of the impacts of this rediscovery in the Nanyang region, is a boom in Mandarin classes.\n\n\n"}

The city was later occupied by Russian troops, who remained for some time before eventually withdrawing.\n\nPoti is the economically vital port of Georgia on the Black Sea. Poti is a critical entry point for the South Caucasus and the land-locked nations of Central Asia.\n\nRussian aircraft bombed Poti on 8 August, and the port was closed for two days. The Russian air force attacked the port on 9 August.\n\nRussian warships were deployed near Georgian ports along the Black Sea coast, including Poti, on 10 August 2008. It was reported that Russia had dropped fragmentation bombs in Poti.\n\nOn 11 August, Georgian officials said that Russian forces had entered Poti, though Russia claimed they had only sent in a reconnaissance mission. In the morning of 12 August, bombing was heard an hour after Russian president had announced he would cease Russian military campaign. Russian troops drove through the port of Poti, and took up positions around it.\n\nOn 13 August, Al Jazeera correspondents in Poti reported \"more and more Russian troops coming into the area all day\" and the destruction of six Georgian vessels. Reporter Hoda Abdel Hamid said that \"Russia is clearly on the offensive.\"\n\nOn 14 August, Reuters reported that witnesses in Poti said that Russian tanks had entered the town and were \"looting\". Russia's deputy chief of the general staff, Anatoliy Nogovitsyn denied the presence of Russian troops in Poti. An Associated Press Television News crew witnessed Russian troops on the outskirts of Poti as they searched an old Soviet military base for Georgian military equipment. On 15 August, BBC reporter said that Russian forces aimed to remove or destroy military equipment in Poti.\n\nFrom 13 to 15 August, according to Moscow Defence Brief, \"Russian paratroops raided Poti again and again, destroying almost all of the docked ships and boats of the Georgian Navy, and took away a quantity of valuable military equipment.\"\n\nOn the morning of 19 August, some 70 Russian troops entered the port grounds. Russian forces in Poti took prisoner 21 Georgian soldiers that were guarding the port. Russians also seized 5 Humvees that were the United States property. They were taken to a Georgian military base occupied by Russian troops at Senaki. Humvees then reportedly were taken to Abkhazia, deep in Russian-held territory. Russian soldiers had deployed artillery along major highways between Abkhazia and Poti. The captured servicemen were members of the Georgian coast guard, who had returned to their previously abandoned positions in Poti on the late night of 18 August. According to Georgian officials, they had a right to do so under the ceasefire agreement. Officials from Poti followed the Russians to Senaki to negotiate the soldiers' release. \"The Wall Street Journal\" said Russian actions in Poti was another blow to Georgia's economy. An Azerbaijani news source quoted a Poti port official as saying, \"All workers were expelled from the port\".\n\nOn 20 August, an official from the Poti port said that the Russian military had withdrawn.\n\nOn 22 August, Russia declared the withdrawal of its forces was completed from Georgia. Yet, two Russian outposts remained outside Poti for patrolling. On 23 August, at a news conference General Anatoly Nogovitsyn insisted that \"These patrols were envisaged in the international agreement\" and \"Poti is outside of the security zone, but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in Hummers.\"\n\nOn 24 August, with Russian forces still within the port of Poti, a US warship arrived with aid supplies in Batumi, south of Poti.\n\nOn 13 September, all posts near Poti were abandoned by 11:00 MSK.\n\nThe UNOSAT carried out the initial analysis of satellite pictures of Poti acquired on 25 August 2008. Six submerged Georgian vessels were identified, while no other damage was visible in the city.\n"}

During his rule he was one of the most powerful and richest captains in Bosnia. He was responsible for the construction of the White mosque in Modriča along with a nearby travelers inn, another mosque, and a madrassa with a fountain in Gračanica, as well as another madrassa in Gradačac. In 1808 he also carried on with the previously started renovation of the family castle in Gradačac.\n\nMarried to Melek-hanuma, Osman had six heirs. In order of birth they were Hamza, Murat, Osman, Muharrem, Husein, and H. Bećir.

Generally the hem falls to, or is just below, the knee and is tailored for a close fit. It is named for its shape: long and slim like a pencil.\n\nThe pencil skirt may be worn either as a separate piece of clothing or as part of a suit. A pencil skirt usually has a vent at the back, or less commonly at the sides, since its slim, narrow shape can otherwise restrict the movement of the wearer. Sometimes a kick pleat, which exposes less skin, is used instead of a vent. Pencil skirts made from stretchy knitted fabrics do not normally need vents or pleats.\n\nSome classic shoes for wearing with a pencil skirt are pumps, or high heels, with sheer stockings or tights. Back-seamed hosiery recalls the classic pencil-skirt era of the 1950s. Pencil skirts can also be worn with flats for a more casual, youthful appearance that echoes the 1960s. Pencil skirts and loafers are classic \"Prep\".\n\nNarrow-fitting skirts have a long history in western fashion. The predecessor to the pencil skirt is the hobble skirt, a pre-World War I fad inspired by the Ballets Russes. This full-length skirt with a narrow hem seriously impeded walking.\n\nThe French designer Christian Dior introduced the classic modern pencil skirt in his 1954 Autumn Winter collection.\n\nThe pencil skirt quickly became very popular, particularly for office wear. This success was due to women's desire for new fashions in the wake of Second World War and Cold War rationing, coupled with the austere economic climate, when fabrics were expensive.\n\nThe pencil skirt feels different from looser skirts, and impacts the wearer's movements and posture. Walking needs to be done in short strides, and entering and leaving a car gracefully takes practice. When sitting, the legs need to be close together. Activities such as climbing ladders and riding bicycles can be very difficult in a pencil skirt. Due to reduced ventilation, the pencil skirt is warmer than other styles, and it is less likely to be blown up by gusts of wind.\n"}
{"id": "21674532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21674532", "title": "Pre-Dorset", "text": "Pre-Dorset\n\nThe Pre-Dorset is a loosely defined term for a Paleo-Eskimo culture or group of cultures that existed in the Eastern Canadian Arctic from c. 3200 to 850 cal BC, and preceded the Dorset culture.\n\nDue to its vast geographical expanse and to history of research, the Pre-Dorset is difficult to define. The term was coined by Collins (1956, 1957) who recognised that there seemed to be people that lived in the Eastern Canadian Arctic prior to the Dorset, but for whose culture it was difficult to give the defining characteristics. Hence, for Collins and others afterward, the term is a catch-all phrase for all occupations of the Eastern Canadian Arctic that predated the Dorset. To Taylor (1968) and Maxwell (1973), however, the Pre-Dorset were a distinct cultural entity, ancestral to the Dorset, and that lived in the Low Arctic of Canada with a number of incursions into High Arctic.\n\nAt the site of Port Refuge on the Grinnell Peninsula, Devon Island, McGhee (1979) distinguished two sets of occupations, one that he ascribed to the Independence I culture, the other to Pre-Dorset. Due to the often poor preservation of organic material and the fact that bones from marine mammals can appear older with radiocarbon dating than their actual age (the marine reservoir effect), it is typically difficult to date Arctic sites. But the Independence I settlement is several metres higher above sea level, and McGhee took this to mean that the Independence I settlement was roughly 300 years older than the Pre-Dorset one at Port Refuge. Indeed, assuming that settlers are always close to the water, because sea levels fell over the centuries, older sites are expected to lie higher above the sea. Most features that McGhee believed different between the Pre-Dorset and Independence I settlements of Port Refuge are problematic and cannot systematically be used to distinguish their cultural affiliation. It has been suggested that Pre-Dorset and Independence I are parts of the same culture.\nMaxwell (1985:107, 109) divided the Pre-Dorset in four phases, a scheme refined by Murray (1999:467):\n\n\nIt is typically difficult to ascribe a Pre-Dorset site to one of these four phases without relying on radiocarbon dates.\n\nThe Low Eastern Arctic, namely Arctic regions on Baffin Island or to the south, are usually considered the core area of the Pre-Dorset.\n\nMost Pre-Dorset occupations are known from the Low Arctic. But the complex is known from a number of occupations in the High Arctic as well, namely to the north of Baffin Island, on the islands of Devon and Ellesmere. One important site, Port Refuge, on Devon island, hosts occupations ascribed to the Pre-Dorset and others ascribed to Independence I. At this site, Pre-Dorset dwellings are clustered and show no mid-passage feature, whereas the Independence I dwellings are arranged linearly with mid-passage features.\n\nThe Pre-Dorset is generally restricted to the Low Arctic, and given that incursions to the High Arctic are rare, incursions into Greenland from the High Arctic are even rarer. Grønnow and Jensen (2003:42-43) ascribe one small site in Greenland to the Pre-Dorset, the only one to date. This is a mid-passage dwelling in Solbakken, Hall Land, just across from the Nares Strait, separating Canada from Greenland. This occupation was identified as Pre-Dorset on the basis of the re-sharpening technique of the burins, as well as other lithic characteristics. There is an Independence I occupation at the same site that the authors believe more ancient than the Pre-Dorset on grounds of altitude (21 vs. 19 m). It appears probable that surveys or re-analysis of excavated material will reveal more Greenlandic Pre-Dorset occupations.\n"}
{"id": "1981121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981121", "title": "Profanum", "text": "Profanum\n\nProfanum is the Latin word for \"profane\". The distinction between the sacred and the profane was considered by Émile Durkheim to be central to the social reality of human religion.\n\nThe profane world consists of all that we can know through our senses; it is the natural world of everyday life that we experience as either comprehensible or at least ultimately knowable — the \"Lebenswelt\" or lifeworld.\n\nIn contrast, the sacred, or \"sacrum\" in Latin, encompasses all that exists beyond the everyday, natural world that we experience with our senses. As such, the sacred or numinous can inspire feelings of awe, because it is regarded as ultimately unknowable and beyond limited human abilities to perceive and comprehend. Durkheim pointed out however that there are degrees of sacredness, so that an amulet for example may be sacred yet little respected.\n\nRites of passage represent movements from one state — the profane – to the other, the sacred; or back again to the profanum.\n\nReligion is organized primarily around the sacred elements of human life and provides a collective attempt to bridge the gap between the sacred and the profane.\n\nModernization and the Enlightenment project have led to a secularisation of culture over the past few centuries – an extension of the profanum at the (often explicit) expense of the sacred. The predominant 21st-century global world view is as a result empirical, sensate, contractual, this-worldly – in short profane.\n\nCarl Jung expressed the same thought more subjectively when he wrote that “I know – and here I am expressing what countless other people know – that the present time is the time of God's disappearance and death”.\n\nThe advance of the profane has led to several countermovements, attempting to limit the scope of the profanum. Modernism set out to bring myth and a sense of the sacred back into secular reality — Wallace Stevens speaking for much of the movement when he wrote that “if nothing was divine then all things were, the world itself”.\n\nFundamentalism – Christian, Muslim, or other – set its face against the profanum with a return to sacred writ.\n\nPsychology too has set out to protect the boundaries of the individual self from profane intrusion, establishing ritual places for inward work in opposition to the postmodern loss of privacy.\n\nSeamus Heaney considered that “the desacralizing of space is something that my generation experienced in all kinds of ways”.\n\n"}

The list was called the Prontuario in short and later formed an important part of the Italianization campaign initiated by the fascist regime, as it became the basis for the official place and district names in the Italian-annexed southern part of the County of Tyrol.\n\nIt has often been criticized by the German-speaking population of the province, on the grounds that the new names often have little perceived historical relevance and that a number have been entirely invented.\n\nIn the 1890s Ettore Tolomei founded a nationalist magazine \"The Italian Nation\", and in 1906 the \"Archivio per l'Alto Adige\". His intention was to create the impression that South Tyrol had originally been an Italian territory, that the German history of South Tyrol was merely a short interruption and that as a consequence the land rightfully belonged to Italy.\n\nToponomy played a major part in Tolomei's struggle right from the beginning. In the articles he wrote for \"The Italian Nation\" he already used Italianized names, although these early attempts lacked the method and purpose of his later activities. In those days he would use the name \"Alto Trentino\" for South Tyrol, not having yet come upon and revived the Napoleonic creation \"Alto Adige\", which would become the official Italian designation for the province after World War I and up to this day. Likewise, he used to call the Brenner Pass \"Pirene\", which in his later publications would become \"Brennero\". His work became more systematical with the founding of the \"Archivio per l' Alto Adige\", through which he began to propose Italianized names for villages and geographical features in South Tyrol. In 1916, a year after Italy, instigated by Allied promises and its own nationalist tendencies, entered the First World War, a commission was set up to find Italian names for places in the \"soon to be conquered territory\". The commission (composed of Tolomei himself, the Professor of Botany and Chemistry Ettore De Toni as well as the librarian Vittorio Baroncelli) reported almost 12,000 Italian place and district names on the basis of Tolomei's studies. In June 1916, this list was published as \"Volume XV, Part II\" of \"Memorie\" of the \"Reale Società Geografica Italiana\" as well as in the \"Archivio per l'Alto Adige\".\n\nTolomei explained the methodology for creating Italian names in his introduction to the \"Prontuario\". The main principles are:\n\n\nThis methodology was however not applied in a uniform, consistent manner, so that often the choice of name seems to have been arbitrary — thus increasing the perception of imposition. While the aim of Tolomeis toponymy was that of bringing the Latin history back to the surface, more often than not it has been perceived as to bury the Romanic roots of historically grown names even deeper due to the relative linguistic incompetence of Tolomei and his team. This can be exemplified by the name of the village \"Lana\", which probably goes back to a Roman landholder named \"Leo\", whose territory was called \"(praedium) Leonianum\". In the High Middle Ages the name was pronounced \"Lounan\". In the Bavarian dialect, the vocal \"ou\" changed to \"a\" in the 12th century, leading to \"Lanan\", which became today's \"Lana\" in German. Contrary to his stated methodology Tolomei kept the name Lana, probably because it sounded Italian and in Italian \"lana\" means \"wool\". The correct Italianization would have been \"Leoniano\" (although exact reconstruction may have been abandoned in favor of pragmatism and aesthetics). The same applies to German Trens and Terenten, derived from Latin \"torrens\" (stream), which were Italianized as Trens and Terento, not recognizing the Romanic roots still present in the German name.\n\nApart from the frequent mistakes and inconsistencies of Tolomei's toponymy, its main fault is the loss of historical information contained in the historically grown geographical names, an effect which was fully intended by Tolomei. Instead of bringing back Alpine Romanity which spoke a Rhaeto-Romance language, he superimposed the Tuscan dialect, on which Standard Italian is based, on the local Romanic traditions. A case in point is the name \"Vipiteno\", derived from Latin \"Vipitenum\". Tolomei preferred this Latin name to \"Sterzen\", the name commonly used by Italians at that time. In doing so, however, he unwittingly chose a name which had undergone Germanization. The original Alpine-Romanic name would have been \"Vibidina\"; the German sound change in the 8th century changed this into \"Wipitina\". As such it was first mentioned in the medieval Latin manuscripts, and in the more recent ones it was further Latinized into \"Vipitenum\", a name which sounded as if it could have been of ancient Roman origin and thus was chosen by Tolomei.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Subsequently, their scope has been expanded to include USB flash drives, portable hard discs, memory cards, CD-ROMs and other removable devices, all of which can potentially carry malware.\n\nThe name sheep dip is derived from a method of killing parasites in a flock of sheep by dipping all of the animals one after another in a trough of pesticide.\n\nA sheep dip is normally a stand-alone computer, not connected to any network. It has antivirus software in order to scan removable media and to protect the sheep dip computer itself. The system can be made more effective by having more than one antivirus program, because any single antivirus product will not be able to detect all types of virus.\n\nIt is very important to secure sheep dip computers as strongly as possible against malware, because their role as a first line of defence means that they are particularly likely to be attacked. Software updates should be applied as soon as they become available. Antivirus signatures should be the most up-to-date that are available, which in practice means that they must be updated at least daily. The operating system should be hardened and locked down as far as possible.\n\nNetwork connections are avoided for two reasons. Firstly, an Internet connection is a potential attack vector via which the computer could be compromised. Secondly, there is a risk that a worm on a removable device might escape into a local area network if the sheep dip computer is connected to it.\n\nComputers running Incident Command System (ICS) Protection Agent will not accept any removable USB media device that has not been scanned and validated by the USB scanner station, thereby blocking all file transfer and application execution from unauthorized devices.\n\nIsolation from networks makes automatic updating impossible, because the sheep dip computer is not able to make contact with the servers from which software updates and antivirus signatures are distributed. It is therefore normal for updates to be applied manually, after they have been downloaded by a separate network-connected computer and copied to a USB flash drive.\n\nWhen a computer's security and antivirus updates are dependent on manual intervention by human beings, the system's security becomes vulnerable to human error. If pressure of work prevents updates from being applied as soon as they become available, a sheep dip computer will gradually become more and more insecure.\n\nAbsence of network connections also makes it difficult for an organisation to monitor the status of sheep dips if it has deployed them to several different locations. The people with central responsibility for IT security must rely on prompt and accurate reports from those who use the sheep dips. Again, there is a risk of human error.\n\nIn an active sheep dip the antivirus protection is monitored in real time with another program in order to increase security. Antivirus is only effective if it is up-to-date, properly configured, and running. Active sheep dips add an extra layer of security by checking antivirus and intervening if necessary.\n\nAt the very least, an active sheep dip must disable access to removable media if it detects that its own antivirus signatures are not up-to-date. A more advanced system can be allowed limited network access for automatic updates and remote monitoring, but it must only enable its network connection when there is no immediate malware risk. When the network connection is active all removable media access must be disabled.\n\n"}

The subsequent Later Zhou and Song Dynasties sought to recover the ceded northern territories. Most of the Sixteen Prefectures including the two principal cities, Youzhou (also called Yanzhou, modern Beijing) and Yunzhou (modern Datong) remained in Liao hands until the 1120s, when the Jurchens of the Jin dynasty conquered the region. In 1123, the Jurchens ceded most of the territories except Yunzhou to the Song, but retook them in 1125. The loss of the Sixteen Prefectures exposed the plains of central China to further incursions by the Jurchens (the ancestor of Manchus) and the Mongols.\n\nThe Sixteen Prefectures were administrative units established during the Tang dynasty. Under the Tang, each prefecture or \"zhou\" was a unit of administration larger than a county but smaller than a province. The Sixteen Prefectures stretched from Ji County in modern-day Tianjin Municipality to Datong in Shanxi Province, extending contiguously along the mountains that divide the agrarian plains of central China from the pastoralist steppes to the north. Several dynasties including the Qin and the Northern Dynasties before the Tang built the Great Wall along these mountains. Seven of the Sixteen Prefectures were located inside (south) of the Inner Great Wall. The other eleven were located in between the Inner and Outer Great Walls. The Tang did not build Great Walls but used frontier military commanders to guard against the northern tribes. The Fanyang or Youzhou-Jizhou Commandery, based in modern-day Beijing commanded 11 of the Sixteen Prefectures. The other seven were commanded by the Hedong Commandery based in Yunzhou, modern Datong.\n\nThe historian Frederick W. Mote writes that there were actually 19 prefectures but does not specify them. Chinese historians do not consider Yíngzhou (营州; modern Qian'an, Hebei) and Pingzhou (平州; modern Lulong, Hebei) to be part of the Sixteen Prefectures because they had already been occupied by the Khitans during the Later Tang, prior to Shi Jingtang’s cession. Yizhou (易州; modern Yi County, Hebei), which fell to the Khitans after the cession, is also excluded from the count of 16. The Liao created two new prefectures, Jingzhou (景州, modern Zunhua, Hebei) from Jizhou and Luanzhou (滦州; Luan County, Hebei) from Pingzhou, which have not been included in the original sixteen.\n\nThe year 907 was a turning point in East Asian history. On that year the pastoral and nomadic people known as the Khitan crowned Abaoji as their new Great Khan, the first from the Yila tribe after some two centuries of leadership by the Yaolian clan. Abaoji coveted the plains of North China, a rich source of plunder that was guarded by a line of passes and fortifications stretching from mountainous northern Shanxi to the Bo Sea. In 905 Abaoji had already started to intervene in northern China by leading a massive army to Datong in Shanxi to swear brotherhood with Li Keyong, a \"partially sinified Shatuo Turk\" who nominally served the severely weakened Tang dynasty as Military Governor of Shanxi on the westernmost point of that defense line.\n\nThe rise of Khitan power under Abaoji occurred just as China was falling into turmoil. The fall of the Tang dynasty in 907 led to power struggles among rival warlords and to the creation of a number of short-lived polities known as the Five Dynasties. The first of these dynasties was founded by Zhu Wen, another military governor, who declared himself emperor of the Later Liang in 907 after deposing the last Tang heir. In 923 his dynasty was overthrown by Li Keyong's son, who had just founded the Later Tang (923–936).\n\nThe Sixteen Prefectures passed into Khitan hands in 938, when the Khitan supported Shi Jingtang, another Shatuo Turk and military governor of Shanxi, in his revolt against the Later Tang. Confident in his own military strength, the Khitan leader, Abaoji's second son Yelü Deguang, convinced Shi to found a new dynasty (the Later Jin, 936–946), but also to cede a large band of territory to the Khitan that represented the entire North China defense line. The Khitan now possessed all the passes and fortifications that controlled access to the northern China plains.\n\nThe Khitan kept using Chinese administrative forms to administer the counties and prefectures they had captured. They named Datong (on the western end of the Sixteen Prefectures) their Western Capital, and in 938 built a new fortified city at Youzhou (near modern-day Beijing), which they turned into their Southern Capital. Under Khitan rule, the Sixteen Prefectures thus represented two of the Liao Empire's five divisions. Both sections were part of the Southern Chancellery, one of two broader divisions the Liao state had been divided into. The Sixteen Prefectures had become the springboard from which the Liao dynasty would exert its influence on northern China.\n\nShi Jingtang, the Later Jin ruler who had ceded the Sixteen Prefectures to the Khitan in 937, died in 942. He had been a staunch ally (some say a puppet) of the Khitan, but his successor Shi Chonggui refused to recognize the Khitan Khan as his superior. After a year of tense diplomatic exchanges, in 943 the Khitan finally resolved to punish Shi for his insubordination. For two years the engagements were indecisive, until in 945, Yelü Deguang, who was leading his troops in battle, was almost killed in a rout of his forces in southern Hebei; he had to flee the battlefield on a camel. The following year, however, the Khitan sovereign launched a new campaign from his Southern Capital (within the Sixteen prefectures), triggering the collapse of the Later Jin. Having seized the Later Jin capital of Kaifeng in early 947, later that year he declared the foundation of the Liao dynasty and proclaimed himself Emperor of China. Known posthumously as Emperor Taizong of Liao, Deguang quickly became disillusioned with governing so many sedentary people who resented Khitan rule, and decided to retreat back to his Southern Capital. Heavy Chinese resistance on the retreat route and Taizong's death in 947 provoked a succession crisis in the Liao government, and an opportunity for a new dynasty in northern China.\n\nStill, the territory remained in Liao hands. However, by 960, the Song dynasty had ended the turmoil that northern China had endured since 907, and by 979, they had essentially unified the kingdom, with the exception of the Sixteen Prefectures.\n\nThe Liao and Song were actually developing reasonably amicable relations in the 960s into the mid-970s, during the reign of Emperor Taizu of Song. Of course, the Song dynasty was still focusing on the south where it was attempting to reunite the bulk of the Chinese realm. However, despite the exchange of embassies in 974 and the growth of profitable trade between the two, there were still two fatal flaws to the relationship. One concerned continued support for the remnant Shatuo Turk Northern Han state. The other was the Song dynasty’s refusal to accept continued Liao possession of the Sixteen Prefectures.\n\nWhen the Song were successful in finally incorporating the Northern Han in 979, the emperor decided to launch an offensive against the Liao in the Sixteen Prefectures. Emperor Taizong led his weary and ill-supplied troops from toward the Liao Southern Capital (present-day Beijing.) The Liao boundary was reached in May and they initially encountered little resistance. By July 20, they had attacked the Southern Capital. Ten days later, the first contingent of Liao cavalry arrived. The ensuing Battle of Gaoliang River on August 1 near the Southern Capital resulted in a complete rout of Song forces, who had to retreat back to Kaifeng. The Sixteen Prefectures would remain in Liao hands.\n\nAfter Emperor Jingzong died, Empress Dowager Chengtian took power at age 30 in 982, serving as a regent for her 11-year-old son Emperor Shengzong and led military campaigns along with her son until her death. The Song once again tried to attack in 986, to take advantage of Shengzong's youth. They sent forces against the territory on three fronts, but the Liao scored decisive victories over all three Song forces. Empress Dowager Chengtian personally led the Liao army in campaigns against the Song Chinese during their invasion of Liao in 986 and defeated them in battle, fighting the retreating Chinese army. She then ordered the castration of around 100 ethnic Chinese boys she had captured in China, supplementing the Khitan's supply of eunuchs to serve at her court, among them was Wang Ji'en. The boys were all under ten years old and were selected for their good looks. The History of Liao (遼史) described and praised Empress Chengtian's capture and mass castration of Chinese boys in a biography on the Chinese eunuch Wang Ji'en. The fifteen-year-old Emperor Shengzong led the Liao’s decisive victory at the Battle of Qigou Pass.\n\nHan Chinese elites held a prominent position in the Liao state along with Khitan elites. One of them was a lineage with the surname Han (韓). The Khitan had abducted the Han clan from Jizhou and despite being Han Chinese, they were thoroughly Kitanized culturally and linguistically and served the Liao Khitan loyally in military and political positions along with several other Han Chinese elite families who were Kitanized. The loyalty of the Han Chinese population of the Liao to the Liao Khitan rulers frustrated the Song Chinese. Khitan women from the imperial consort clan were given to the men of the Chinese Han family for marriage. One member of this lineage was Han Derang (韓德讓), who was close to the Khitan royal family and whose paternal ancestors served the Liao from the time of Abaoji's reign. Han Derang was the Chinese minister who the Khitan Empress Dowager Chengtian had a love affair with, and Chengtian was rumoured to have a son with him.\n\nThrough the 990s, relations between the Song and Liao steadily worsened. Beginning in 999, the Liao would use the Sixteen Prefectures as the launching pad for victorious, but inconsequential attacks on the Song. Then, in 1004, Liao emperor Shengzong launched another major campaign against the Song. The Shanyuan Treaty signed in early 1005 resulted in annual tribute paid to the Liao dynasty by the Song dynasty.\n\nThis treaty was the guide by which relations between the two dynasties would progress until the fall of the Liao dynasty. The Sixteen Prefectures would remain in their possession until that time.\n\n\n\n \n"}

They can be seen when a ploughed out earthwork has left hard dry material of a former bank and damper wetter material from a former ditch. They can also occur when a feature has cut through the top soil to reveal underlying chalk.\n\nSoil marks are traces of archaeological features, which are visible in ploughed or harrowed fields, usually where there are restricted periods before the crops grow.\n\nThe most obvious and occurring trace of soil marks is the color difference to the rest of soil. Depending of the area in the aspect of geology the soil marks can show up as brown against white background or vice versa with even darker against lighter tones. The color of the soil is very important in determining whether or not organic or burnt deposits happened over the soil that would produce a black or red color soil. This allows archaeologists to understand the concept of the artefacts found in the region of the soil mark and can see whether or not fire was used.\n\nArchaeology that involves plough-damaged field systems, burial mounds, Roman villas or former sites usually produce soil marks. The soil marks gives the archaeologists an idea of where the structures were built or where the soil was damaged and for what reason. An example was given that this might be a dried-up river channel (known as a palaeochannel), which may subsequently reveal rich waterlogged archaeological deposits in its lower layers, or an area of slightly higher ground above winter flood level on an alluvial floodplain, which may be very hard to detect from the ground but which has attracted settlement for thousands of years.\n"}

In consequence of the scale of the devastation wrought on Europe by Nazi Germany, the theory of German history has progressively gained a following inside and outside Germany, especially since the late 1960s. In particular, its proponents argue that the way Germany developed over the centuries virtually ensured the evolution of a social and political order along the lines of Nazi Germany. In their view, German mentalities, the structure of society, and institutional developments followed a different course in comparison with the other nations of the West, which had a normal development of their histories. The German historian Heinrich August Winkler wrote about the question of there being a : \"For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a 'unique German path'. And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the 'normal path'\".\n\nThe term was first used by German conservatives in the Imperial period, starting in the late 19th century as a source of pride at the \"Golden Mean\" of governance that in their view had been attained by the German state, whose distinctiveness as an authoritarian state lay in taking the initiative in instituting social reforms, imposing them without waiting to be pressured by demands \"from below\". This type of authoritarianism was seen to be avoiding both the autocracy of Imperial Russia and what they regarded as the weak, decadent and ineffective democratic governments of Britain and France. The idea of Germany as a great Central European power, neither of the West nor of the East was to be a recurring feature of right-wing German thought right up to 1945.\n\nHistorian Hans-Ulrich Wehler of the Bielefeld School places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s and 1870s, when economic modernization took place, but political modernization did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service. Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernizing society. Recognizing the importance of modernizing forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations ().\n\nNazi Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and its invasion of Poland in September 1939 (the latter invasion immediately drawing France and Britain into World War II) provoked the drive to explain the phenomenon of Nazi Germany. In 1940, Sebastian Haffner, a German émigré living in Britain, published \"Germany: Jekyll and Hyde\", in which he argued it was Adolf Hitler alone, by the force of his peculiar personality, who had brought about Nazi Germany. In 1941, the British diplomat Robert Vansittart published \"The Black Record: Germans Past And Present\", according to which Nazism was only the latest manifestation of what Vansittart argued were the exclusively German traits of aggressiveness and brutality. Other books with a thesis similar to Vansittart's were Rohan Butler's \"The Roots of National Socialism\" (1941) and William Montgomery McGovern's \"\" (1946).\n\nAfter Germany's defeat in World War II in 1945, the term lost its positive connotations from the 19th century and acquired its present negative meaning. There was much debate about the origins of this \"German catastrophe\" (as the German historian Meinecke titled his 1946 book) of Nazi Germany's rise and fall. Since then, scholars have examined developments in intellectual, political, social, economic and cultural history to investigate why German democracy failed during the Weimar Republic and which factors led to the rise of National Socialism. In the 1960s, many historians concluded that the failure of Germany to develop firm democratic institutions in the 19th century had been decisive for the failure of the Weimar Republic in the 20th century.\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, the debate was polarized with most non-German participants at one pole and German participants at the other. Historians like Léon Poliakov, A. J. P. Taylor, and Sir Lewis Bernstein Namier, echoed by journalists like the American William L. Shirer, portrayed Nazism as the inevitable result of German history, reflecting unique flaws in \"German national character\" that went back to the days of Martin Luther, if not earlier.\n\nDuring the Raleigh Lecture on History in 1944, Namier stated that the German liberals in the Revolution of 1848 were \"in reality forerunners of Hitler\", whose views about the Poles and Czechs presaged the great international crises of 1938–39, and called the 1848 revolution \"a touchstone of German mentality and a decisive element in East-European politics\" In his lecture, Namier described the 1848 revolution as \"the early manifestations of aggressive nationalism, especially of German nationalism which derives from the much belauded Frankfort Parliament rather than from Bismarck and \"Prussianism\". Namier concluded \"had not Hitler and his associates blindly accepted the legend which latter-day liberals, German and foreign had spun around 1848, they might well have found a great deal to extol in the of the Frankfort Assembly\".\n\nTaylor wrote in his 1945 book \"The Course of German History\" that the Nazi regime \"represented the deepest wishes of the German people\", and that it was the first and only German government created by the Germans as the Holy Roman Empire had been created by France and Austria, the German Confederation by Austria and Prussia and the Weimar Republic by the Allies. By contrast, Taylor argued \"But the Third Reich rested solely on German force and impulse; it owed nothing to alien forces. It was a tyranny imposed upon the German people by themselves\". Taylor argued that National Socialism was inevitable because the Germans wanted \"to repudiate the equality with the peoples of eastern Europe which had then been forced upon them\" after 1918. Taylor wrote that:\n\nDuring the preceding eighty years the Germans had sacrificed to the all their liberties; they demanded as a reward the enslavement of others. No German recognized the Czechs or Poles as equals. Therefore, every German desired the achievement which only total war could give. By no other means could the \"Reich\" be held together. It had been made by conquest and for conquest; if it ever gave up its career of conquest, it would dissolve.\n\nThe American historian Peter Viereck wrote in his 1949 book \"Conservatism Revisited: The Revolt Against the Revolt 1815–1949\" that:\n\nIs it being unhistorical to judge the anti-Metternichian nationalism and racism of 19th century Germany by its Nazi consequences? Were those consequences the logical outcome or a modern accident for which nationalism should not be blamed? Is it a case of the wise-after-the-fallacy to read so much into those early rebels of 1806-1848, whom many historians still consider great liberals?...The liberal university professors, Metternich's fiercest foes and now so prominent in 1848, were often far from the cloudy idealists pictured in our textbooks. From his own viewpoint, Bismarck erred in mocking their lack of \"Realpolitik\". The majority... was more Bismarckian than Bismarck ever realized. Many liberals... later became leading propagandists for Bismarck, along with the new National Liberal Party. Only an honorable few continued to oppose him and the militarist success-worship that followed his victorious wars.\n\nShirer in his 1960 book \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\" argued for the view that German history proceeded logically from \"Luther to Hitler\", seeing Hitler's rise to power as an expression of German character, rather than of the international phenomenon of totalitarianism. Shirer encapsulated this view with the passage, \"...the course of German history... made blind obedience to temporal rulers the highest virtue of Germanic man and put a premium on servility.\"\n\nThe French historian Edmond Vermeil wrote in his 1952 book (\"Contemporary Germany\") that Nazi Germany was not \"a purely adventitious episode appearing on the fringes of the German tradition\" Instead, Vermeil contended that German nationalism had an especially aggressive character, which had been restrained only by Bismarck. After Bismarck's dismissal in 1890, Vermeil wrote \"It was after his fall, under William II, that this nationalism, breaking all barriers and escaping from the grip of a weak government, gave rise to a state of mind and a general situation that we have to analyze, for otherwise Nazism with its momentary triumphs and its terrible collapse will remain incomprehensible\". Vermeil concluded that Germany will remain on a separate path, \"always placing the spirit of its implacable technical discipline at the service of those visions of the future that its eternal romanticism begets\".\n\nPoliakov wrote that even if not all Germans supported the Holocaust, it was \"tacitly accepted by the popular will\"\n\nIn contrast, German historians such as Friedrich Meinecke, Hans Rothfels, and Gerhard Ritter, joined by a few non-German historians such as Pieter Geyl, contended that the Nazi period had no relationship to earlier periods of German history, and that German traditions were at sharp variance with the totalitarianism of the Nazi movement. Meinecke famously described National Socialism in his 1946 book (\"The German Catastrophe\") as a particularly unfortunate (\"on-the-job accident\") of history. Although opposed to what they regarded as Meinecke's excessively defensive tone, Ritter and Rothfels have been joined by their intellectual heirs Klaus Hildebrand, Karl Dietrich Bracher, and Henry Ashby Turner in contending that though the Nazi dictatorship was rooted in the German past, it was individual choices made during the later Weimar years that led to the Nazi years. Though Bracher is opposed to the interpretation of German history, he does believe in a special German mentality () that emerged in the late 18th century. Bracher wrote that:\n\nThe German \"\" should be limited to the era of the Third Reich, but the strength of the particular German mentality [] that had arisen already with its opposition to the French Revolution and grew stronger after 1870 and 1918 must be emphasized. Out of its exaggerated perspectives (and, I would add, rhetoric) it become a power in politics, out of a mythic reality. The road from democracy to dictatorship was not a particular German case, but the radical nature of the National Socialist dictatorship corresponded to the power of the German ideology that in 1933–1945 became a political and totalitarian reality \n\nIn a 1983 speech, Hildebrand denied there had been a , and claimed that the only applied to the \"special case\" of the Nazi dictatorship In a 1984 essay, Hildebrand went further and wrote:\n\nIt remains to be seen, whether future scholarship will initiate a process of historicization of the Hitler period, for example by comparing it with Stalinist Russia and with examples such as the Stone Age Communism of Cambodia. This would doubtless be accompanied by terrifying scholarly insights and painful human experiences. Both phenomena could, , even relativize the concept of the German between 1933 and 1945 \n\nIn response, Heinrich August Winkler argued that there was a before 1933, and that Germany as a country deeply influenced by the Enlightenment meant there was no point of comparison between Hitler on one hand, and Pol Pot and Stalin on the other\n\nStarting in the 1960s, historians such as Fritz Fischer and Hans-Ulrich Wehler argued that, unlike France and Britain, Germany had experienced only \"partial modernization\", in which industrialization was not followed by changes in the political and social spheres, which in the opinion of Fischer and Wehler continued to be dominated by a \"pre-modern\" aristocratic elite. In the opinion of the proponents of the thesis, the crucial turning point was the Revolution of 1848, when German liberals failed to seize power and consequently either emigrated or chose to resign themselves to being ruled by a reactionary elite, living in a society that taught its children obedience, glorification of militarism, and pride in a very complex notion of German culture. During the latter half of the Second Reich, from about 1890 to 1918, this pride, they argued, developed into hubris. Since 1950, historians such as Fischer, Wehler, and Hans Mommsen have drawn a harsh indictment of the German elite of the period 1870–1945, who were accused of promoting authoritarian values during the Second Reich, being solely responsible for launching World War I, sabotaging the democratic Weimar Republic, and aiding and abetting the Nazi dictatorship in internal repression, war, and genocide. In the view of Wehler, Fischer, and their supporters, only the German defeat in 1945 put an end to the \"premodern\" social structure which had led to and then sustained traditional German authoritarianism and its more radical variant, National Socialism. Wehler has asserted that the effects of the traditional power elite in maintaining power up to 1945 \"and in many respects even beyond that\" took the form of:\n\na penchant for authoritarian politics; a hostility toward democracy in the educational and party system; the influence of preindustrial leadership groups, values and ideas; the tenacity of German state ideology; the myth of the bureaucracy; the superimposition of caste tendencies and class distinctions; and the manipulation of political antisemitism.\n\nAnother version of the thesis emerged in the United States in the 1950s-1960s, when historians such as Fritz Stern and George Mosse examined ideas and culture in 19th-century Germany, especially those of the virulently anti-Semitic movement. Mosse and Stern both concluded that the intellectual and cultural elites in Germany by and large chose to consciously reject modernity and along with it those groups they identified with modernity, such as Jews, and embraced anti-Semitism as the basis for their (world-view). However, in recent years, Stern has abandoned his conclusion and now argues against the thesis, holding the views of the movement to be a mere \"dark undercurrent\" in the Second Reich.\n\nIn 1990, Jürgen Kocka wrote about the s theories:\n\nYet, at the same time, researches looked back to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to uncover the deeper roots of the Third Reich. Through comparisons with England, France, the United States, or simply \"the West\", they attempted to identify the peculiarities of Germany history, those structures and processes, experiences, and turning points, which while they may not have led directly to National Socialism, nevertheless hindered the long term development of liberal democracy in Germany and eventually facilitated the triumph of fascism. Many authors made various contributions to the elaboration of this argument, usually without actually using the word .\n\nHelmuth Plessner, for example, spoke of the \"belated nation\" (), the delayed creation of a nation-state from above. Other historians have argued that nationalism played an especially aggressive, precociously right-wing destructive role during the Second Empire. Ernst Fraenkel, the young Karl Dietrich Bracher, Gerhard A. Ritter, M. Rainer Lepsius, and others identified powerful long-term weaknesses in the Empire's system of government: the blocked development of parliamentarianism, the severely fragmented system of parties that resembled self-contained blocks, and other factors that later burdened Weimar and contributed to its breakdown. Leonard Krieger, Fritz Stern, George Mosse and Kurt Sontheimer emphasized the illiberal, antipluralistic elements in German political culture upon which National Socialist ideas could later build.\n\nHans Rosenberg and others argued that preindustrial elites, especially the east Elbian landowners (the \"Junkers\"), upper-level civil servants and the officer corps retained great power and influence well into the twentieth century. In the long term, they represented an obstacle to democratization and parliamentarianism. As Heinrich August Winkler has shown, their effort is visible in the pernicious role played by agrarian interests in the collapse of the Weimar Republic. The unification of Germany by means of \"blood and iron\" under Prussian hegemony expanded the political influence and social weight of the officer corps with its status-oriented claims to exclusivity and autonomy. Along with the old elites, many traditional and preindustrial norms, ways of thinking and modes of life also survived. These included the authoritarian outlook and antiproletarian claims of the petty bourgeoise as well as militaristic elements of middle-class political culture, such as the institution of the \"reserve officer\". The liberal Max Weber criticized the \"feudalization\" of the upper bourgeoisie, which seemed to accept both the disproportional representation of the nobility in politics as well as aristocratic norms and practices instead of striving for power on its own terms or cultivating a distinctly middle-class culture. Lacking the experience of a successful revolution from below, schooled in a long tradition of bureaucratically led reforms from above, and challenged by a growing workers' movement, the German bourgeoise appeared relatively weak and—compared with the West—almost \"unbourgeois\"\n\nAnother variant of the theory has been provided by Michael Stürmer who, echoing claims of conservative historians during the Imperial and Weimar periods, argues that it was geography that was the key to German history. Stürmer contends that what he regards as Germany's precarious geographical situation in the heart of Central Europe left successive German governments no other choice but to engage in authoritarianism. Stürmer's views have been very controversial; they would become one of the central issues in the notorious (\"Historians' Quarrel\") of the mid-1980s. One of Stürmer's leading critics, Jürgen Kocka, himself a proponent of the view of history, argued that \"Geography is not destiny\", suggesting that the reasons for the were political and cultural instead. Kocka wrote against Stürmer that both Switzerland and Poland were also \"lands in the middle\", and yet neither country went in the same authoritarian direction as Germany.\n\nIn his 1992 book \"Ordinary Men\", Christopher Browning opposed the theory that Germans in the Nazi era were motivated by the especially virulent anti-Semitism that had characterized German culture for centuries. Analyzing the troops of the special police battalion units, who were the ones who directly killed Jews in the mass raids phase of the Holocaust (prior to the death camps), Browning concluded that these typical middle class workers were not ingrained with anti-Semitism, but rather became killers through peer pressure and indoctrination.\n\nThe debate on the was renewed by American scholar Daniel Goldhagen with his 1996 book, \"Hitler's Willing Executioners\". Goldhagen countered that German society, politics, and life up until 1945 were characterized by a unique version of extreme anti-Semitism that held the murder of Jews as the highest possible national value. His critics (e.g., Yehuda Bauer) replied that Goldhagen ignored most recent research and ignored other developments both in Germany and abroad. Ruth Bettina Birn asserts that Goldhagen \"allow[ed] his thesis to dictate his presentation of the evidence\". Nonetheless, Goldhagen is often held to have succeeded in reviving the debate on the question of a German \"collective guilt\", and, in Germany, of bringing many Germans to a modern confrontation with, and a lively and fruitful debate about, the legacy of the Holocaust.\n\nThe leading critics of the thesis have been two British Marxist historians, Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn, who in their 1984 book \"The Peculiarities of German History\" (first published in German in 1980 as ) argued that there is no normal course of social and political change; that the experience of France and Britain in the 19th century was not the norm for Europe; and that even if the liberal German middle class was disempowered at the national political level, it nevertheless dominated the social, economic and cultural life of 19th-century Germany. This embourgeoisement of German social life was greater than in Britain and France, which in the opinion of Eley and Blackbourn was more distinctly marked by aristocratic values than was Germany. Blackbourn and Eley rejected the entire concept of the as a flawed construct supported by \"a curious mixture of idealistic analysis and vulgar materialism\" that led to an \"exaggerated linear continuity between the nineteenth century and the 1930s\". In the view of Blackbourn and Eley, there was no , and it is ahistorical to judge why Germany did not become Britain for the simple reason that Germany is Germany and Britain is Britain. Moreover, Eley and Blackbourn argued that after 1890 there was a tendency towards greater democratization in German society with the growth of civil society as reflected in the growth of trade unions and a more or less free press. From the right, Otto Pflanze claimed that Wehler's use of such terms as \"Bonapartism\", \"social imperialism\", \"negative integration\" and (\"the politics of rallying together\") has gone beyond mere heuristic devices and instead become a form of historical fiction. The German conservative historian Thomas Nipperdey in a 1975 book review of Wehler's , argued that Wehler presented German elites as more united than they were, focused too much on forces from above and not enough on forces from below in 19th-century German society, and presented too stark a contrast between the forces of order and stabilization versus the forces of democracy with no explanation for the relative stability of the Empire. In Nipperdey's opinion, Wehler's work fails to explain how the Weimar Republic occurred, since, according to Wehler, prior to 1918 the forces of authoritarianism were so strong and those of democracy so weak. Nipperdey concluded his review that a proper history of the Imperial period could only be written by placing German history in a comparative European and trans-Atlantic perspective, which might allow for \"our fixation on the struggle with our great-grandfathers\" to end.\n\nMany scholars have disputed Eley's and Blackbourn's conclusions, among them Jürgen Kocka and Wolfgang Mommsen. Kocka in particular has argued that while the thesis may not explain the reasons for the rise of the Nazi movement, it still explains the failure of the democratic Weimar Republic. This seems to entail that the issue of the is limited to an individual development (albeit of a type frequently encountered). Thus, many historians today feel that the theory fails to account for similarities and distinctions with other dictatorships and ethnic cleansings.\n\nDetlev Peukert in his highly influential 1987 (English translation 1992) work \"The Weimar Republic: The Crisis of Classical Modernity\" suggested Germany's experience was a crisis involving socio-political phenomena common to all modernising countries.\n\nSchubert states that the history of the Holy Roman Empire is not to be confused with the , which can only be seen as a result of the concept of German identity, developing in the Romanticism of the late 18th century, reinforced by the Napoleonic Wars in which Germany was under French occupation. Previous events, especially those of the Holy Roman Empire, cannot be related to the evolution of Nazism.\n\n\n\n"}

According to Fraser, it was an event that did happen (and was not fabricated by the existing government, as argued by what she refers to as 'No-Plotters' in subsequent historiography) though its precise nature and significance is open to historical debate. Fraser argues that there was indeed a plot, though it was rather different in type and details from the one described by a contemporary such as Sir Edward Coke.\n\nFraser's opinion is that the plot represented an act of political terrorism, based on her definition of it as being \"the weapon of the weak, pretending to be strong\". An alternative categorisation is that it was in fact an attempted political coup d'état which did not aim to damage the pre-existing political establishment but instead to usurp and replace it.\n\nShe also argues that few of the facts surrounding the case are unambiguous or beyond discussion, drawing in 653 references citing in excess of 276 sources to prove that multiple aspects of the plot are in fact shrouded in mystery and competing claims to authenticity. As one example, she favours the view that Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury was responsible for the authorship of the anonymous Monteagle letter warning the Catholic Lord Monteagle to avoid Parliament on the day of the plot, rather than another figure such as Francis Tresham.\n\nFraser is sympathetic towards the Catholic gentry who practiced their religion in the presence of discriminatory legislation under the rule of Elizabeth I and James I, conditions that were, as one contemporary priest described, a \"ruthless and unloving land\" for those of the Catholic faith.\n"}

The model did not emerge to its end state all at once. The complete overthrow of the post–World War II status quo, known as the Cold War, left two superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) vying for ultimate global supremacy. They created two camps, known as blocs. These blocs formed the basis of the concepts of the First and Second Worlds.\n\nEarly in the Cold War era, NATO and the Warsaw Pact were created by the United States and The Soviet Union, respectively. They were also referred to as the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. The circumstances of these two blocks were so different that they were essentially two worlds, however, they were not numbered first and second. The onset of the Cold War is marked by Winston Churchill's famous \"Iron Curtain\" speech. In this speech, Churchill describes the division of the West and East to be so solid that it could be called an iron curtain.\n\nIn 1952, the French demographer Alfred Sauvy coined the term Third World in reference to the three estates in pre-revolutionary France. The first two estates being the nobility and clergy and everybody else comprising the third estate. He compared the capitalist world (i.e., First World) to the nobility and the communist world (i.e., Second World) to the clergy. Just as the third estate comprised everybody else, Sauvy called the Third World all the countries that were not in this Cold War division, i.e., the unaligned and uninvolved states in the \"East–West Conflict.\" With the coining of the term Third World directly, the first two groups came to be known as the \"First World\" and \"Second World,\" respectively. Here the three-world system emerged.\n\nHowever, Shuswap Chief George Manuel believed the Three Worlds Model to be outdated. In his 1974 book \"The Fourth World: An Indian Reality\", he describes the emergence of the Fourth World while coining the term. The fourth world refers to \"nations,\" e.g., cultural entities and ethnic groups, of indigenous people who do not compose states in the traditional sense. Rather, they live within or across state boundaries (see First Nations).

{"id": "154902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154902", "title": "Totalitarian democracy", "text": "Totalitarian democracy\n\nTotalitarian democracy is a term popularized by Israeli historian J. L. Talmon to refer to a system of government in which lawfully elected representatives maintain the integrity of a nation state whose citizens, while granted the right to vote, have little or no participation in the decision-making process of the government. The phrase had previously been used by Bertrand de Jouvenel and E. H. Carr, and subsequently by F. William Engdahl and Sheldon S. Wolin.\n\nJ. L. Talmon's 1952 book \"The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy\" discusses the transformation of a state in which traditional values and articles of faith shape the role of government into one in which social utility takes absolute precedence. His work is a criticism of the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose political philosophy greatly influenced the French Revolution, the growth of the Enlightenment across Europe, as well the overall development of modern political and educational thought. In \"The Social Contract\", Rousseau contends that the interests of the individual and the state are one and the same, and it is the state's responsibility to implement the \"general will\".\n\nThe political neologism messianic democracy (also political Messianism) also derives from Talmon's introduction to this work:\n\nThe philosophy of totalitarian democracy, according to Talmon, is based on a top-down view of society, which sees an absolute and perfect political truth to which all reasonable humans are driven. It is contended that not only is it beyond the individual to arrive at this truth independently, it is his duty and responsibility to aid his compatriots in realizing it. Moreover, any public or private activities that do not forward this goal have no useful purpose, sap time and energy from those that do, and must be eliminated. Thus economic and social endeavors, which tend to strengthen the collective, are seen as valuable, whereas education and religion, which tend to strengthen the individual, are seen as counterproductive. \"You cannot be a citizen and a Christian at the same time,\" says Talmon, referring to Rousseau's arguments, \"for the loyalties clash.\"\n\nIn his paper \"Advances in Chinese Social Sciences\" (2001), Mao Shoulong, a professor of Public Policy at Renmin University of China, takes a different position. He posits that totalitarian democracy, or what he terms \"equality-oriented democracy,\" is founded on the idea that it is possible, and necessary, that the complete rights and freedoms of people ought not be held hostage to traditions and social arrangements. Mao recognizes that the term \"totalitarian\" has a connotation attached to it, used as it was by Giovanni Gentile to apply to the Italian fascist government led by Benito Mussolini. He sees the proponents of liberal democracy (or \"Western\" democracy) as holding a negative attitude to the word and believing that force is not an appropriate way to achieve a goal no matter the value of that goal. He prefers the term \"freedom-oriented democracy\" to describe such a political entity.\n\nA totalitarian democracy, says Talmon, accepts \"exclusive territorial sovereignty\" as its right. It retains full power of expropriation and full power of imposition, i.e., the right of control over everything and everyone. Maintenance of such power, in the absence of full support of the citizenry, requires the forceful suppression of any dissenting element except what the government purposely permits or organizes. Liberal democrats, who see political strength as growing from the bottom up (cf: \"grass roots\"), reject in principle the idea of coercion in shaping political will, but the totalitarian democratic state holds it as an ongoing imperative.\n\nA totalitarian democratic state is said to maximize its control over the lives of its citizens by using the dual rationale of general will (i.e., \"public good\") and majority rule. An argument can be made that in some circumstances it is actually the political, economic, and military élite who interpret the general will to suit their own interests. Again, however, it is the imperative of achieving the overarching goal of a political nirvana that shapes the vision of the process, and the citizen is expected to contribute to the best of his abilities; the general is not asked to guide the plow, nor is the farmer asked to lead the troops.\n\nIt can approach the condition of totalitarianism; totalitarian states can also approach the condition of democracy, or at least majoritarianism. Citizens of a totalitarian democratic state, even when aware of their true powerlessness, may support their government. When Germany started World War II, the Nazi government had the support of the majority of Germans and it was not until much later, after Germany's losses began to mount, that support for Hitler began to fade. Joseph Stalin was practically worshipped by hundreds of millions of Soviet citizens, many of whom have not changed their opinion even today, and his status ensured his economic and political reforms would be carried out.\n\nThe period of the Cold War following WWII saw great ideological polarization between the so-called \"Free World\" and the Communist states. In the East, religious and intellectual repression was met with increasing resistance, and the Hungarian revolt of 1956 and Alexander Dubček's Prague Spring in 1968 are two well-known acts of defiance where thousands were murdered in cold blood by their governments. The Tienanmen Square Massacre was a similar example of repressive violence leading to hundreds of deaths. In the United States, alleged Communists and Communist sympathizers were investigated by Senator Joseph McCarthy in what later generations would recall as a \"witch hunt\"; many accused Communists were forced out of their jobs or their reputations were scandalized. Shortly after the time of Talmon's book, the Vietnam War brought active hostility between elements in the U.S. government and political factions within the American people. One faction insisted that the U.S. government did not represent them in levying war in Southeast Asia, protesting the war, as well as undemocratic or oligarchical power-structures within U.S. society; this faction occasionally saw repression from the government, such as through \"dirty tricks\" aimed at \"subversives\" by the FBI in COINTELPRO. This conflict within U.S. society rose to violence during the protests and riots at the Democratic National Convention of 1968 in Chicago, Illinois, and in the Kent State Massacre, where 4 anti-war protesters were shot dead by U.S. National Guard forces.\n\nOne concept fundamental to both \"liberal\" and \"totalitarian\" democracy is that of liberty. According to Talmon, totalitarian democracy sees freedom as something achieved only in the long term, and only through collective effort; the political goal of ultimate order and ultimate harmony brings ultimate freedom. In addressing every aspect of the lives of its citizens, the totalitarian democratic state has the power to ensure that all material needs are met from cradle to grave, and all that is required of the citizen is to carry out his role, whatever it may be, to the best of his ability. Liberal democracy, on the other hand, posits freedom as something that can and should be achieved by the individual in the short term, even at the expense of things such as material well-being, and sees as an element of this freedom a \"freedom from government\" wherein the individual is able to exercise \"freedom\" in his own terms to the extent that they do not contravene the law. Proponents of both kinds of democracy argue that their particular approach is the best one for the citizens of their respective countries.\n\nIt is Mao Shoulong's contention that \"equality-oriented democracy recognises the value of freedom but holds that [it] can't be attained by individual efforts,\" but rather, by collective efforts. He argues that while equality-oriented democracy stresses the value of equality over individual freedoms, the reverse is true for freedom-oriented democracy, and in each case, the state will move either to ensure equality by limiting individual freedom, or to ensure individual freedom by giving up equality. Some critics of this view may argue that equality and individual freedoms are inseparable, and that one cannot exist (or be sustained) without the other. Other critics argue that equality can only be ensured by continuous coercion, while ensuring individual freedom only requires force against coercive individuals and external states.\n\nShoulong also holds that a law is not valid if it does not have the approval of the public. Laws passed by the state do not require approval by the citizen on a case-by-case basis, and it can be easily argued that some laws currently in place in some countries purporting to be liberal democracies do not have the approval of the majority of citizens. For one, Rousseau argued in \"The Social Contract\", that in the stereotypical liberal democracy, individuals are politically \"free\" once every Parliamentary term, or every two to four years, when they vote for their representatives, in their General Election or on Election Day. Yet, Rousseau fails to consider that the state is not a total institution within the liberal democracies, and that the freedom of the citizen in between the elections is the freedom of the citizen to live their life in pursuit of their own happiness, subject to the law made by their elected representatives, who are, in turn, subject to popular pressure, public protest, petition, recall, referendum, initiative, and ultimately, electoral defeat if they fail to heed the views of those they represent. This is in contrast to a totalitarian democracy, with the state as a total institution, where the individual is truly not free without constant participation in their \"democratic\" government; and thus, the individual in the totalitarian democracy must be \"forced to be free\" if the totalitarian democracy is not to become a totalitarian oligarchy.\n\nEngdahl and Wolin add some new dimensions to the analysis of totalitarianism. In \"Full Spectrum Dominance: Totalitarian Democracy and the New World Order,\" Engdahl focuses on the American drive to achieve global hegemony through military and economic means. According to him, U.S state objectives have led to internal conditions that resemble totalitarianism: \"[it is] a power establishment that over the course of the Cold War has spun out of control and now threatens not only the fundamental institutions of democracy, but even of life on the planet through the growing risk of nuclear war by miscalculation\"\n\nWolin, too, analyzes the symbiosis of business and public interests that emerged in the Cold War to form the \"tendency\" of what he calls \"inverted totalitarianism:\"\n\nWhile exploiting the authority and resources of the state, [inverted totalitarianism] gains its dynamic by combining with other forms of power, such as evangelical religions, and most notably by encouraging a symbiotic relationship between traditional government and the system of \"private\" governance represented by the modern business corporation. The result is not a system of codetermination by equal partners who retain their respective identities but rather a system that represents the political coming-of-age of corporate power.\n\nElsewhere, in an article entitled \"Inverted Totalitarianism\" Wolin cites phenomena such as the lack of involvement of citizens in a narrow political framework (due to the influence of money), the privatization of social security, and massive increases in military spending and spending on surveillance as examples of the push away from public and towards private-controlled government. Corporate influence is explicit through the media, and implicit through the privatization of the university. Furthermore, many political think-tanks have abetted this process by spreading conservative ideology. Wolin states: \"[With] the elements all in place...what is at stake, then, is nothing less than the attempted transformation of a tolerably free society into a variant of the extreme regimes of the past century\"\n\nSlavoj Žižek comes to similar conclusions in his book \"Welcome to the Desert of the Real.\" Here he argues that the war on terror served as a justification for the suspension of civil liberties in the USA, while the promise of democracy and freedom was spread abroad as the justification for invading Iraq and Afghanistan. Since Western democracies are always justifying states of exception, they are failing as sites of political agency.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5897173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5897173", "title": "Trojan language", "text": "Trojan language\n\nThe language spoken by the Trojans in the \"Iliad\" is Homeric Greek. However, there has been some scholarly debate on what language the historical Trojans would have spoken at the time of the Trojan War, identified with the site Troy VIIa. The language likely to have been prevalent in the historical city is Luwian, although there are no direct records.\n\nThe cultural context in which the lost Trojan language existed was described by Jaan Puhvel, \"Homer and Hittite\" (1991).\n\nThe Trojans in the \"Iliad\" have no difficulty in speaking to their Greek opponents. However, this may merely be evidence that a fictional convention frequently used in narratives in later times had already been adopted by the poet of the \"Iliad\": for example, Jason finds no language barrier with Medea in Colchis, and Trojan Aeneas converses without difficulty both with Punic Dido and with Latin Turnus.\n\nGreek legend gives further indications on the subject of language at Troy. For one thing, the allies of Troy, listed at length in the Trojan Battle Order which closes book 2 of the \"Iliad\", are depicted as speaking various languages and thus needing to have orders translated to them by their commanders (2.802-6). Elsewhere in the poem (4.433–38) they are compared to sheep and lambs bleating in a field as they talk together in their different languages. The inference is that, from the Greek point of view, the languages of Trojans and their allied neighbors were not as unified as those of the Achaeans.\n\nHilary Mackie has detected in the \"Iliad\" a consistent differentiation between representations in Greek of Achaean and Trojan speech; in simplest terms, Trojans speak poetically, with the aim of avoiding conflict, whereas Achaeans repeatedly engage in public, ritualized abuse that linguists term (from another source) flyting: \"Achaeans are proficient at blame, while Trojans perform praise poetry\" (Mackie 1998:83).\n\nThere was not enough evidence to fruitfully speculate upon the language of Troy until 1995, when a late Hittite seal was found in the excavations at Troy, probably dating from about 1275 BC. Not considered a locally made object, this item from the Trojan \"state chancellery\" was inscribed in Luwian and to date provides the \"only\" archaeological evidence for any language at Troy at this period. It indicates that Luwian was known at Troy, which is not surprising since it was a lingua franca of the Hittite empire, of which Troy was probably in some form of dependency.\n\nAnother sphere of research concerns a handful of Trojan personal names mentioned in the \"Iliad\". Among sixteen recorded names of Priam's relatives, at least nine (including \"Anchises\" and \"Aeneas\") are not Greek and may be traced to \"pre-Greek Asia Minor\". On this basis Calvert Watkins in 1986 argued that the Trojans may have been Luwian-speaking. For instance, the name \"Priam\" is connected to the Luwian compound \"Pariya-muwa\", which means \"exceptionally courageous\".\n\nAdditionally, the Alaksandu treaty describes Mira, Haballa, Seha and Wilusa (usually identified with Troy) as the lands of Arzawa, although this \"has no historical or political basis\", suggesting that it was the language that they had in common. Frank Starke of the University of Tübingen concludes that \"the certainty is growing that Wilusa/Troy belonged to the greater Luwian-speaking community\". Joachim Latacz also regards Luwian as the official language of Homeric Troy, but he finds it highly probable that another language was in daily use. Ilya Yakubovich provides a critical evaluation of the arguments by Watkins and Starke in his University of Chicago dissertation and concludes that the ethnicity of the Trojans remains completely unknown.\n\n"}

Graduated and received his commission from M.V. Frunze Higher Naval School in 1926 and graduated from the Naval Academy in 1932. From 1932 to 1936 he served on ships of the Baltic Fleet (the \"Parizhskaya Kommuna\" and the \"Battleship Marat\") and commanded the destroyer \"Yakov Sverdlov\". From February 1938 to April 1939 Tributs served as the Chief of Staff of the Baltic Fleet and from April 1939 to 1947 he commanded it.\n\nAs war approached, Tributs observed the growing evidence of hostile German activity with apprehension; in the summer of 1940, he \"advanced Baltic Fleet headquarters from its historic seat at the Kronstadt fortress in Leningrad to the port of Tallinn, two hundred miles to the west\" despite his worries about security problems and the difficulty of constructing a new base. On June 19 he put the Baltic Fleet up to \"Readiness No. 2\" state, which meant fueling the ships and putting their crews on alert, and late on the evening of June 21 (the eve of the German invasion) he moved to \"Readiness No. 1\" state, which was fully operational. On August 17, the defense of Leningrad was placed in his hands.\n\nA leading navy commander during the Siege of Leningrad, Tributs led the Soviet evacuation of Tallinn, organized military operations in defense of the ports of Kronstadt and Oranienbaum during 1941-1943, and arranged counterattacks by naval aircraft of the Baltic Fleet defending Leningrad from aerial bombing attacks. His active involvement in the defense of Leningrad helped to save the city from still more destruction, but failed to save the suburban palaces of the Tsars, such as the Peterhof Palace, from destruction by the Nazis.\n\nFrom March 1946 until May 1947 he commanded the 8th Fleet (Baltic Fleet). On May 28, 1947 he was made Deputy Chief of the troops of the Far East for the Navy. In June 1948, was recalled to Moscow. In September 1948 - January 1949 - The head of the military and naval schools and senior naval officer in Leningrad. In March, 1949 - December 1951 - Head of the Hydrographic Department of the Navy of the USSR. In June and September 1948 and January–March 1949 remained at the disposal of the Commander in Chief.\n\nTributs retired in February 1961 and, turning to military history after his retirement, he produced over 50 works including military histories of the Baltic Fleet and its operations during the Second World War.\n\nThe Udaloy class destroyer \"Admiral Tributs\" is named after him.\n\n\n"}
