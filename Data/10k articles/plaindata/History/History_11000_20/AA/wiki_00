It consists of a panel of eight drawings of Indigenous Australian activist Ken Colbung speaking to a group of three Indigenous Australian children. The cartoon's content offended many Indigenous Australians, and resulted in a complaint of racism to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The commission eventually ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to Nyungar beliefs but did not breach the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. This ruling was subsequently upheld on appeal to the Federal Court of Australia.\n\n\"Alas Poor Yagan\" was published shortly after the return of Yagan's head from the United Kingdom. Yagan was a Nyungar warrior who resisted the European settlement of Western Australia. He was shot dead by a settler in 1833, and his head was removed and sent to the United Kingdom for display in a museum. In 1964, it was buried in an unmarked grave in a local cemetery. The Nyungar community began efforts to locate and repatriate the head in 1990. Yagan's head was finally exhumed in September 1997, but organisation of the handover \"was accompanied by a degree of sometimes undignified acrimony over who had the appropriate cultural claims, by descent, to bring the remains back\". These conflicts within the Nyungar community were publicly aired, and at one point even involved litigation in the Supreme Court of Western Australia.\n\n\"The West Australian\" provided coverage of the repatriation of Yagan's head, including the conflict within the Nyungar community. \"Alas Poor Yagan\" was published on 6 September 1997. It was critical of the fact that the return of Yagan's head had become a source of conflict between Nyungars instead of fostering unity, and it lampooned the conduct of those involved in the conflict. It could also be interpreted as insulting aspects of Indigenous Australian culture, and casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of Indigenous Australians with mixed racial heritage.\n\nOn 24 September 1997, a complaint about the cartoon was lodged with the Race Discrimination Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The complaint was made by human rights lawyer Hannah McGlade on behalf of a group of people calling themselves \"The Nyungar Circle of Elders\", and comprising Albert Corunna, Richard Wilkes, Violet Newman, Mingli Wanjurri, Leisha Eatts, Robert Bropho and Ken Colbung. The complainants alleged that Alston and \"The West Australian\" had breached \"s18c of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975\".\n\nOn 4 March 1998, the Race Discrimination Commissioner discontinued her inquiry into the case on the grounds that the cartoon was \"an artistic work\" that was published \"reasonably and in good faith\", and was therefore exempt from the s18c conditions under s18d of the Act. The Nyungar Circle of Elders rejected that finding, and asked for the case to be referred to the Commission for public inquiry. A public hearing was held on 29 April 1999, and the findings released on 12 April 2001. The Commission found that the cartoon was in breach of s18c of the Act; specifically, it found that the cartoon:\nThe Commission also found, however, that the cartoon was exempt under s18d of the Act, because it was done reasonably and in good faith. The reasoning was based partly on the overall coverage of the issue by \"The West Australian\", which \"provided a balance report... and an opinion which... encouraged unity in, and support of, the Aboriginal community\". In such a context, the decision by then editor Paul Murray to publish the cartoon was found to be reasonable.\n\nRobert Bropho then sought a judicial review of the Commission's finding, but his application was dismissed on 4 December 2002. Bropho then appealed against that decision in the Federal Court of Australia. On 6 February 2004, the Federal Court dismissed the appeal and ordered Bropho to pay all costs.\n\nAccording to McGlade, a number of academic commentators have expressed concern about the ruling, in particular that the protections offered under s18c were being undermined by a broad interpretation of the s18d exemption. McGlade has argued that \"It is extremely difficult to reconcile the serious finding of breach under section18C with the subsequent finding of reasonableness under section 18D.\" and that \"obviously the adverse findings made of the Commission could have been relied upon to defeat the respondent's claim to have acted reasonably and in good faith. It appears that the complainants were placed under an impossible burden of proving explicit motive and intent... [P]roper remedies are being denied by the responsible bodies.\" A similar point is made by Anna Chapman, who argues that \"the result of the case was a reification of dominant racial values... in prioritising non-indigenous racial narratives over Indigenous perspectives.\"\n"}

The tunic was typically worn under the toga with the right side stripe visible.\n\nThe \"angusticlavia\" was the tunic associated with the rank and office of the \"eques\", or equestrians, one of the two highest legal orders in aristocratic Rome. Order members were military men, often patricians (\"patrici\"), who served as the cavalry units in war. During times of peace they frequently served as personal assistants to Roman senators. Equestrians wore the angusticlavia under the trabea, a short toga of distinctive form and color. They also wore equestrian shoes (\"calcei\"), and a gold ring (anulus aureus). The tunic's stripes were about an inch wide, which contrasted with the senator's laticlavus, which bore three-inch wide stripes.\n\nThe angusticlavia's purple-hued bands distinguished members of the equestrian order from other Roman dignitaries and from regular citizens. In ancient Rome, the color purple became increasingly linked to the higher classes, and eventually to the emperor and the empire's magistrates. Thus, the angusticlavia served to indicate social status above regular citizenry but below senators and magistrates.\n\nOn certain occasions, particularly during times of political or social upheaval, senators in Rome chose to wear the equestrian tunic as a public display of distress. This practice was part of the semi-egalitarian legacy of the Republic. In 58 BCE, when the tribune of the plebs Clodius was pushing Cicero into exile, the senators took on the \"angusticlavia\" in public protest. In 53 BCE, during a period of civic violence, the consuls put aside their senatorial dress (the laticlavus) and summoned the senate in equestrian attire (the \"angusticlavia\"). Over the course of ancient Roman history, the angusticlavia lost its symbolic meaning and class association. Wall paintings and other representations of the Roman past \"show all types of men and boys wearing stripes of similar width -- but there were later attempts to enforce or reintroduce the senatorial and equestrian classes.\"\n\nThe Latin word \"angusticlavia\" is compounded of \"angustus\" (\"narrow; small\") and \"clavus\" (\"nail; stud\"). The word \"clavus,\" or \"nail\", refers to the stripes, for being as long as nails. The term \"angustus\", or \"narrow\", refers to these stripes or ornaments as being slimmer than on the senatorial laticlavus.\n\n"}

It is thought that Asadal was located in Manchuria, northeastern Hwanghae Province (Hangul/ Hanja: 황해/黃海) in North Korea, or Pyongyang Province (Hangul/ Hanja: 평양/平壤) - that is, either the legendary kingdom in situ within the province of Pyongyang, not referring to the modern-day capital of North Korea - Pyongyang. \n\nThe first Korean historical work to mention it is the \"Samguk Yusa\" (Hangul/ Hanja: 삼국유사/三國遺事 - \"Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms\"), which cites the Chinese \"Book of Wei\" (Korean Hangul/ Hanja: 위서/魏書 - \"wi-seo\"). The \"Samguk Yusa\" also cites the lost historical records of \"Go-gi\" (고기/古記 - \"Old Analects/ Records\") to the effect that Dan'gun's capital was located in Pyongyang. But recent studies show that there were more than one city named Pyongyang (which literally means \"flat soil\" in Chinese), situated in the north deep in Manchuria - possibly bordering in between China and Russia. The Pyongyang that is North Korea's capital today is actually the Southern counterpart, as it was common at the time for an emperor to manage two capitals and rule in two palaces. Therefore, it could be that the \"true\" Asadal is located in Manchuria.\n\nIt is often hypothesized that Asadal may be a compound noun composed of two elements, \"asa\" and \"dal\". This hypothesis appears to be motivated by an assumption of equivalence between the Chinese phonetic transcription 阿斯達, which is read in Modern Korean as \"Asadal\" (but in Mandarin Chinese as \"Asīdá\" and in Modern Japanese as \"Ashitatsu\" or \"Ashidachi\"), and the word 朝鮮 (Mandarin \"Cháoxiǎn\" or \"Cháoxiān\", Korean \"Joseon\", Japanese \"Chōsen\") \"Joseon, another name for Korea.\" However, the etymology of Joseon is unknown; it is not even clear whether it has been created as a phonetic transcription of a foreign name or rather as a semantic calque of a foreign name, and the \"Cháo\" reading of the first syllable of the Mandarin Chinese form is identical with the reading of this character when used to mean \"dynasty,\" not with the reading of this character when used to mean \"morning\" (which would be *\"Zhāo\" instead). Despite the weakness of this hypothesis, \"Asa-\" in \"Asadal\" is sometimes claimed to be cognate with a common Korean word for \"morning\" (Middle Korean \"achɔm\", Modern Korean \"achim\"), probably because of obvious phonetic similarity with Japanese 朝 \"asa\" \"morning.\" However, the Chinese character 斯, which is used in the modern Chinese language mainly to represent the phoneme /s/ or /θ/ in word-final and preconsonantal positions when transcribing foreign words, has always had a sibilant (/s/) rather than an affricate like Korean \"ch\", and the Chinese language has plenty of characters that would be better suited to transcribing Korean \"ch\". \"Dal\" may be the result of reading Chinese characters in the Korean way, and the original Chinese pronunciation at the time Asadal was recorded in ancient historical texts could have been \"Da,\" a transcription of the Korean word \"sdah\" or \"ddang\" meaning \"land.\" If such is the case, \"Asadal\" would mean \"Morning Land.\" However, if \"dal\" has been used much like the Goguryeo city name suffix \"-dal\" used for mountains and cities founded on plateaus/mountains, then \"Asadal\" would mean \"Morning Mountain.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He went to Harvard University during WWII, studying across several disciplines but graduating with a B.S. in history in 1944. He returned to study for an M.A. in geography at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1950. At Berkeley his research was on the Guianas, working with Carl Sauer. He earned his PhD in history from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, for a study of the life of George Perkins Marsh, an early geographer and conservationist. \n\nLowenthal was inducted into the U.S. Army Infantry in May 1943 and deployed in September 1944, three months after D-Day. He left active service with trench foot, and it was while recuperating in Somerset that his long association with England, later to become his adopted country, began. In December 1944, he was reassigned to Army Intelligence and embarked on a mission to count toilets in German castles to ascertain how well each might support the occupation forces.

As Z. A. Jordan notes, \"Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of development which reflect basic properties of 'matter in motion as a whole'.\"\n\nThe formulation of the Soviet version of dialectical and historical materialism (such as in Stalin's book \"Dialectical and Historical Materialism\") in the 1930s by Joseph Stalin and his associates, became the \"official\" Soviet interpretation of Marxism. It was codified and popularized in textbooks which were required reading in the Soviet Union as well as in some Eastern European countries. It was exported to China as the \"official\" interpretation of Marxism.\n\nMarx and Engels never used the words \"dialectical materialism\" in their own writings. The term was coined in 1887 by Joseph Dietzgen, a socialist who corresponded with Marx, during and after the failed 1848 German Revolution. Casual mention of the term \"dialectical materialism\" is also found in the biography \"Frederick Engels\", by philosopher Karl Kautsky, written in the same year. Marx himself had talked about the \"materialist conception of history\", which was later referred to as \"historical materialism\" by Engels. Engels further explained the \"materialist dialectic\" in his \"Dialectics of Nature\" in 1883. Georgi Plekhanov, the father of Russian Marxism, later introduced the term \"dialectical materialism\" to Marxist literature. Joseph Stalin further delineated and defined dialectical and historical materialism as the world outlook of Marxism-Leninism, and as a method to study society and its history.\n\nMarx and Engels each began their adulthood as Young Hegelians, one of several groups of intellectuals inspired by the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Marx's doctoral thesis, \"The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature\", was concerned with the atomism of Epicurus and Democritus, which is considered the foundation of materialist philosophy. Marx was also familiar with Lucretius's theory of \"clinamen\". Marx and Engels both concluded that Hegelian philosophy, at least as interpreted by their former colleagues, was too abstract and was being misapplied in attempts to explain the social injustice in recently industrializing countries such as Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, which was a growing concern in the early 1840s.\n\nIn contrast to the conventional Hegelian dialectic of the day, which emphasized the idealist observation that human experience is dependent on the mind's perceptions, Marx developed Marxist dialectics, which emphasized the materialist view that the world of the concrete shapes socioeconomic interactions and that those in turn determine sociopolitical reality. Whereas some Hegelians blamed religious alienation (estrangement from the traditional comforts of religion) for societal ills, Marx and Engels concluded that alienation from economic and political autonomy, coupled with exploitation and poverty, was the real culprit. In keeping with dialectical ideas, Marx and Engels thus created an alternative theory, not only of why the world is the way it is but also of which actions people should take to make it the way it ought to be. In \"Theses on Feuerbach\" (1845), Marx wrote, \"The philosophers have only \"interpreted\" the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to \"change\" it.\" Dialectical materialism is thus closely related to Marx's and Engels's historical materialism (and has sometimes been viewed as synonymous with it). Marx rejected the language of \"thesis, antithesis, synthesis\".\n\nDialectical materialism is an aspect of the broader subject of materialism, which asserts the primacy of the material world: in short, matter precedes thought. Materialism is a realist philosophy of science, which holds that the world is material; that all phenomena in the universe consist of \"matter in motion,\" wherein all things are interdependent and interconnected and develop according to natural law; that the world exists outside us and independently of our perception of it; that thought is a reflection of the material world in the brain, and that the world is \"in principle\" knowable. Marx criticized classical materialism as another idealist philosophy—idealist because of its transhistorical understanding of material contexts. The Young Hegelian Ludwig Feuerbach had rejected Hegel's idealistic philosophy and advocated materialism. Despite being strongly influenced by Feuerbach, Marx rejected Feuerbach's version of materialism as inconsistent. The writings of Engels, especially \"Anti-Dühring\" (1878) and \"Dialectics of Nature\" (1875–82), were the source of the main doctrines of dialectical materialism.\n\nThe concept of dialectical materialism emerges from statements by Marx in the second edition postface to his magnum opus, \"Capital\". There Marx says he intends to use Hegelian dialectics but in revised form. He defends Hegel against those who view him as a \"dead dog\" and then says, \"I openly avowed myself as the pupil of that mighty thinker Hegel.\" Marx credits Hegel with \"being the first to present [dialectic's] form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner\". But he then criticizes Hegel for turning dialectics upside down: \"With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.\"\n\nMarx's criticism of Hegel asserts that Hegel's dialectics go astray by dealing with ideas, with the human mind. Hegel's dialectic, Marx says, inappropriately concerns \"the process of the human brain\"; it focuses on ideas. Hegel's thought is in fact sometimes called dialectical idealism, and Hegel himself is counted among a number of other philosophers known as the German idealists. Marx, on the contrary, believed that dialectics should deal not with the mental world of ideas but with \"the material world\", the world of production and other economic activity.\n\nFor Marx, human history cannot be fitted into any neat \"a priori\" schema. He explicitly rejects the idea of Hegel's followers that history can be understood as \"a person apart, a metaphysical subject of which real human individuals are but the bearers\". To interpret history as though previous social formations have somehow been aiming themselves toward the present state of affairs is \"to misunderstand the historical movement by which the successive generations transformed the results acquired by the generations that preceded them\". Marx's rejection of this sort of teleology was one reason for his enthusiastic (though not entirely uncritical) reception of Darwin's theory of natural selection.\n\nFor Marx, dialectics is not a formula for generating predetermined outcomes but is a method for the empirical study of social processes in terms of interrelations, development, and transformation. In his introduction to the Penguin edition of Marx's \"Capital\", Ernest Mandel writes, \"When the dialectical method is applied to the study of economic problems, economic phenomena are not viewed separately from each other, by bits and pieces, but in their inner connection as an integrated totality, structured around, and by, a basic predominant mode of production.\"\n\nMarx's own writings are almost exclusively concerned with understanding human history in terms of systemic processes, based on modes of production (broadly speaking, the ways in which societies are organized to employ their technological powers to interact with their material surroundings). This is called \"historical materialism\". More narrowly, within the framework of this general theory of history, most of Marx's writing is devoted to an analysis of the specific structure and development of the capitalist economy.\n\nFor his part, Engels applies a \"dialectical\" approach to the natural world in general, arguing that contemporary science is increasingly recognizing the necessity of viewing natural processes in terms of interconnectedness, development, and transformation. Some scholars have doubted that Engels's \"dialectics of nature\" is a legitimate extension of Marx's approach to social processes. Other scholars have argued that despite Marx's insistence that humans are natural beings in an evolving, mutual relationship with the rest of nature, Marx's own writings pay inadequate attention to the ways in which human agency is constrained by such factors as biology, geography, and ecology.\n\nEngels postulated three laws of dialectics from his reading of Hegel's \"Science of Logic\". Engels elucidated these laws as the materialist dialectic in his work \"Dialectics of Nature\":\n\n\nThe first law, which originates with the ancient Ionian philosopher Heraclitus, was seen by both Hegel and Vladimir Lenin as the central feature of a dialectical understanding of things:\n\nThe second law Hegel took from Ancient Greek philosophers, notably the paradox of the heap, and explanation by Aristotle, and it is equated with what scientists call phase transitions. It may be traced to the ancient Ionian philosophers, particularly Anaximenes from whom Aristotle, Hegel, and Engels inherited the concept. For all these authors, one of the main illustrations is the phase transitions of water. There has also been an effort to apply this mechanism to social phenomena, whereby population increases result in changes in social structure. The law of the passage of quantitative changes into qualitative changes can also be applied to the process of social change and class conflict.\n\nThe third law, \"negation of the negation\", originated with Hegel. Although Hegel coined the term \"negation of the negation\", it gained its fame from Marx's using it in \"Capital\". There Marx wrote this: \"The [death] knell of capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators [capitalists] are expropriated. The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of production, produces capitalist private property. This is the first negation [antithesis] of individual private property. [The \"first negation\", or antithesis, negates the thesis, which in this instance is feudalism, the economic system that preceded capitalism.] ... But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It [final communism, the synthesis] is the negation of [the] negation.\"\n\nZ. A. Jordan notes, \"Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of development which reflect basic properties of 'matter in motion as a whole'.\"\n\nAfter reading Hegel's \"Science of Logic\" in 1914, Lenin made some brief notes outlining three \"elements\" of logic. They are:\n\n\nLenin develops these in a further series of notes, and appears to argue that \"the transition of quantity into quality and vice versa\" is an example of the unity and opposition of opposites expressed tentatively as \"not only the unity of opposites but the transitions of every determination, quality, feature, side, property into every other [into its opposite?].\"\n\nAlso, in his essay \"On the Question of Dialectics\", Lenin stated that \"Development is the 'struggle' of opposites.\"\nHe stated that \"The unity (coincidence, identity, equal action) of opposites is conditional, temporary, transitory, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, just as development and motion are absolute.\"\n\nIn \"Materialism and Empiriocriticism\" (1908), Lenin explained \"dialectical materialism\" as three axes: (i) the materialist inversion of Hegelian dialectics, (ii) the historicity of ethical principles ordered to class struggle, and (iii) the convergence of \"laws of evolution\" in physics (Helmholtz), biology (Darwin), and in political economy (Marx). Hence, Lenin was philosophically positioned between historicist Marxism (Labriola) and determinist Marxism—a political position close to \"social Darwinism\" (Kautsky). Moreover, late-century discoveries in physics (x-rays, electrons), and the beginning of quantum mechanics, philosophically challenged previous conceptions of matter and materialism, thus matter seemed to be disappearing. Lenin disagreed:\n'Matter disappears' means that the limit within which we have hitherto known matter disappears, and that our knowledge is penetrating deeper; properties of matter are disappearing that formerly seemed absolute, immutable, and primary, and which are now revealed to be relative and characteristic only of certain states of matter. For the \"sole\" 'property' of matter, with whose recognition philosophical materialism is bound up, is the property of \"being an objective reality\", of existing outside of the mind.\n\nLenin was developing the work of Engels, who said that \"with each epoch-making discovery, even in the sphere of natural science, materialism has to change its form.\" One of Lenin's challenges was distancing materialism, as a viable philosophical outlook, from the \"vulgar materialism\" expressed in the statement \"the brain secretes thought in the same way as the liver secretes bile\" (attributed to 18th-century physician Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis); \"metaphysical materialism\" (matter composed of immutable particles); and 19th-century \"mechanical materialism\" (matter as random molecules interacting per the laws of mechanics). The philosophic solution that Lenin (and Engels) proposed was \"dialectical materialism\", wherein matter is defined as \"objective reality\", theoretically consistent with (new) developments occurring in the sciences.\n\nLenin reassessed Feuerbach's philosophy and concluded that it was in line with dialectical materialism.\n\nGyörgy Lukács, Minister of Culture in the brief Béla Kun government of the Hungarian Soviet Republic (1919), published \"History and Class Consciousness\" (1923), in which he defined \"dialectical materialism\" as the knowledge of society as a whole, knowledge which, in itself, was the class consciousness of the proletariat. In the first chapter \"What is Orthodox Marxism?\", Lukács defined \"orthodoxy\" as fidelity to the \"Marxist method\", not fidelity to \"dogmas\":\nOrthodox Marxism, therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx's investigations. It is not the \"belief\" in this or that thesis, nor the exegesis of a \"sacred\" book. On the contrary, orthodoxy refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction that dialectical materialism is the road to truth and that its methods can be developed, expanded, and deepened, only along the lines laid down by its founders. (§1)\nIn his later works and actions, Lukács became a leader of Democratic Marxism. He modified many of his formulations of his 1923 works and went on to develop a Marxist ontology and played an active role in democratic movements in Hungary in 1956 and the 1960s. He and his associates became sharply critical of the formulation of dialectical materialism in the Soviet Union that was exported to those countries under its control. In the 1960s, his associates became known as the Budapest School.\n\nLukács philosophical criticism of Marxist revisionism proposed an intellectual return to the Marxist method. As did Louis Althusser, who later defined Marxism and psychoanalysis as \"conflictual sciences\"; that political factions and revisionism are inherent to Marxist theory and political praxis, because dialectical materialism is the philosophic product of class struggle:\n\nFor this reason, the task of orthodox Marxism, its victory over Revisionism and utopianism can never mean the defeat, once and for all, of false tendencies. It is an ever-renewed struggle against the insidious effects of bourgeois ideology on the thought of the proletariat. Marxist orthodoxy is no guardian of traditions, it is the eternally vigilant prophet proclaiming the relation between the tasks of the immediate present and the totality of the historical process. (§5)\n...the premise of dialectical materialism is, we recall: 'It is not men's consciousness that determines their existence, but, on the contrary, their social existence that determines their consciousness'... Only when the core of existence stands revealed as a social process can existence be seen as the product, albeit the hitherto unconscious product, of human activity. (§5)\n\nPhilosophically aligned with Marx is the criticism of the individualist, bourgeois philosophy of the subject, which is founded upon the voluntary and conscious subject. Against said ideology is the primacy of social relations. Existence—and thus the world—is the product of human activity, but this can be seen only by accepting the primacy of social process on individual consciousness. This type of consciousness is an effect of ideological mystification.\n\nAt the 5th Congress of the Communist International (July 1924), Grigory Zinoviev formally denounced Lukács's heterodox definition of \"orthodox Marxism\" as exclusively derived from fidelity to the \"Marxist method\", and not to Communist party dogmas; and denounced the Marxism developments of the German theorist Karl Korsch.\n\nIn the 1930s, Joseph Stalin and his associates formulated a version of dialectical and historical materialism that became the \"official\" Soviet interpretation of Marxism. It was codified in Stalin's work, \"Dialectical and Historical Materialism\" (1938), and popularized in textbooks used for compulsory education within the Soviet Union and throughout the Eastern Bloc. It was exported to China as the \"official\" interpretation of Marxism but, in its Soviet formulation, has since then been widely rejected there.\n\nIn \"On Contradiction\" (1937), Mao outlined a version of dialectical materialism that subsumed two of Engels's three principal laws of dialectics, \"the transformation of quantity into quality\" and \"the negation of the negation\" as sub-laws (and not principal laws of their own) of the first law, \"the unity and interpenetration of opposites\".\n\nHistorian of science Loren Graham has detailed at length the role played by dialectical materialism in the Soviet Union in disciplines as diverse as biology, psychology, chemistry, cybernetics, quantum mechanics, and cosmology. He has concluded that, despite the Lysenko period in genetics and constraints on free inquiry imposed by political authorities, dialectical materialism had a positive influence on the work of many Soviet scientists.\n\nSome evolutionary biologists, such as Richard Lewontin and the late Stephen Jay Gould, have tried to employ dialectical materialism in their approach. They view dialectics as playing a precautionary heuristic role in their work. From Lewontin's perspective, we get this idea:\nDialectical materialism is not, and never has been, a programmatic method for solving particular physical problems. Rather, a dialectical analysis provides an overview and a set of warning signs against particular forms of dogmatism and narrowness of thought. It tells us, \"Remember that history may leave an important trace. Remember that being and becoming are dual aspects of nature. Remember that conditions change and that the conditions necessary to the initiation of some process may be destroyed by the process itself. Remember to pay attention to real objects in time and space and not lose them in utterly idealized abstractions. Remember that the qualitative effects of context and interaction may be lost when phenomena are isolated\". And above all else, \"Remember that all the other caveats are only reminders and warning signs whose application to different circumstances of the real world is contingent.\"\nGould shared similar views regarding a heuristic role for dialectical materialism. He wrote that:\n\n...dialectical thinking should be taken more seriously by Western scholars, not discarded because some nations of the second world have constructed a cardboard version as an official political doctrine.\n...when presented as guidelines for a philosophy of change, not as dogmatic precepts true by fiat, the three classical laws of dialectics embody a holistic vision that views change as interaction among components of complete systems and sees the components themselves not as a priori entities, but as both products and inputs to the system. Thus, the law of \"interpenetrating opposites\" records the inextricable interdependence of components: the \"transformation of quantity to quality\" defends a systems-based view of change that translates incremental inputs into alterations of state, and the \"negation of negation\" describes the direction given to history because complex systems cannot revert exactly to previous states.\nThis heuristic was also applied to the theory of punctuated equilibrium proposed by Gould and Niles Eldredge. They wrote that \"history, as Hegel said, moves upward in a spiral of negations\", and that \"punctuated equilibria is a model for discontinuous tempos of change (in) the process of speciation and the deployment of species in geological time.\" They noted that \"the law of transformation of quantity into quality\", \"holds that a new quality emerges in a leap as the slow accumulation of quantitative changes, long resisted by a stable system, finally forces it rapidly from one state into another\", a phenomenon described in some disciplines as a paradigm shift. Apart from the commonly cited example of water turning to steam with increased temperature, Gould and Eldredge noted another analogy in information theory, \"with its jargon of equilibrium, steady state, and homeostasis maintained by negative feedback\", and \"extremely rapid transitions that occur with positive feedback\".\n\nLewontin, Gould, and Eldredge were thus more interested in dialectical materialism as a heuristic than a dogmatic form of 'truth' or a statement of their politics. Nevertheless, they found a readiness for critics to \"seize upon\" key statements and portray punctuated equilibrium, and exercises associated with it, such as public exhibitions, as a \"Marxist plot\".\n\nSome critics argue against dialectical materialism on account of its adherence to a purely materialist worldview, while others have objections to the dialectic method it employs. There are critics, such as the Marxist Alain Badiou, who dispute the way the concept is interpreted. Joseph Needham, an influential historian of science and a Christian who nonetheless was an adherent of dialectical materialism, suggested that a more appropriate term might be \"dialectical organicism\". Leszek Kołakowski, writing in \"Main Currents of Marxism\" (1976), argued that dialectical materialism consists partly of \"truisms with no specific Marxist content\", partly of \"philosophical dogmas\", partly of nonsense, and partly of statements that—depending on how they are interpreted—could be any of these things. Max Eastman argued that dialectical materialism lacks a psychological basis.\n\nPhilosopher Allen Wood argued that, in its form as an official Soviet philosophy, dialectical materialism was doomed to be superficial because \"creativity or critical thinking\" was impossible in an authoritarian environment. Nevertheless, he considered the basic aims and principles of dialectical materialism to be in harmony with rational scientific thought.\n\n"}

{"id": "6761170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6761170", "title": "Dominickers", "text": "Dominickers\n\nThe Dominickers are a small biracial or triracial ethnic group that was once centered in the Florida Panhandle county of Holmes, in a corner of the southern part of the county west of the Choctawhatchee River, near the town of Ponce de Leon. The group was classified in 1950 as one of the \"reputed Indian-White-Negro racial isolates of the Eastern United States\" by the United States Census Bureau.\n\nFew facts are known about their origins, and little has been published about this group.\n\nThe first known mention in print of the Dominickers' existence is an article in \"Florida: A Guide to the Southernmost State\", published by the Federal Writers' Project in 1939. The article \"Ponce de Leon\" identifies the Dominickers as being descendants of the widow of a pre-Civil War plantation owner and one of her black slaves, by whom she had five children. (A separate oral tradition has it that the slave was the mulatto half-brother of the woman's deceased husband, but this has not been verified.)\n\nThe unsigned article said that numerous descendants still lived in the area at the time of writing, and their children attended a segregated school (as required by Florida's Jim Crow laws). Dominickers were not accepted as social equals by the white community, but they did not associate with the black community, either. The Dominickers formed a small middle layer of Holmes County society separate from both whites and blacks (somewhat analogous to the status of Louisiana Creoles before the United States purchase of the Louisiana Territory).\n\nAccording to the article, their appearance varied from very fair (white) to \"Negroid\" (black), even among the siblings of a single family. It also says the pejorative nickname \"Dominickers\" originated when a local man in a divorce case described his estranged wife as \"black and white, like an old Dominicker chicken.\" Another account says the description applied to the man with whom she was living.\n\nTwo unpublished typescripts prepared for the FWP Florida guidebook, but not included in it, are now archived at the University of Florida library in Gainesville. They were likely sources or drafts of the published article.\n\nThese typescripts go into further detail than the published article on the appearance and behavior of the Dominickers, calling them as \"sensitive, treacherous, and vindictive\" and \"pathetically ignorant.\" The men are described as \"big and burly looking,\" known for their skill at breaking horses and making moonshine whiskey. The women, however, are much less kindly described as \"low in stature, fat, and shapeless,\" wearing loose clothing and going barefoot all the time.\n\nOne article notes that Dominickers were \"treated with the same courtesy that a Negro receives—never served at a public fountain nor introduced to a white person.\" A few Dominicker children were allowed to attend the white high school in Westville, but they were \"never allowed to actually graduate.\"\n\nIn contrast to these descriptions, photographs of known Dominickers from the late 19th and early 20th centuries show that their appearance ranged from fair-complected to swarthy, but not \"Negroid,\" as claimed; the women, especially, seem to have had an olive-skinned, wavy-haired \"Mediterranean\" look. One scholarly writer, a native of the area, states, \"Most of these people are Spanish or Cuban in appearance.\"\n\nThe typescripts give five different accounts of the Dominickers' origins, which are said to include Euchee Indian ancestors, suggesting there were originally several distinct mixed-race families in the area in various combinations of white, black, and Indian blood, descendants of whom intermarried, all of them eventually being considered Dominickers. One typescript says, \"they are about three-fourths white and one-eighth Negro and one-eighth Indian.\"\n\nFor example, one story that can be pieced together from the typescripts as well as from some more reliable published sources, says that Jim Crow (no connection with the segregation laws called by that name), an \"Indian prince,\" son of Chief Sam Story of the local Euchee Indians, married Harriet, a beautiful, \"more than two-thirds white\" house servant belonging to a local white family; they produced a daughter, Eliza. When the Euchees migrated to southern Florida in 1832, shortly after Sam Story's death, Harriet (who may have been her owner's daughter) and the baby stayed behind with the white family. When Eliza grew up, she married a \"yellow boy\" (mulatto) named Jim Harris, son of a slave belonging to another white family. Their daughter, Lovey, eventually married another \"yellow boy\" and had a large family of good-looking children, who \"married into another half-breed family.\" It is also said that other Euchees besides Jim Crow left many descendants (presumably mixed-race) in the area.\n\nFederal censuses of Holmes and the adjacent counties of Walton and Washington dating back to 1850 list many Dominicker families and individuals, variously identified as white, mulatto, and black (even among members of the same family). Classifications for a given individual often changed from one census to the next, as they were dependent on the opinion of the census enumerator. The census records show that in the decades following the Civil War many Dominickers married white spouses, and their children had even more white ancestry.\n\nThe 1950 federal census instructed enumerators to make note of local populations of mixed white, black, and Indian ancestry in the eastern United States. In Holmes County, Florida, and nowhere else, 60 Dominickers were so counted although they were designated as white on the census.\n\nIn 1956, a United States Public Health Service worker, who had tabulated the 1950 census findings, made a brief visit to the area and interviewed some white residents. He was unable to make contact with any Dominickers, said to number about 40 at that time. His field notes indicate that at least one Dominicker claimed to be of Spanish and Indian descent. He also noted that \"the term Dominicker is not acceptable to the group and is not used in their presence.\"\n\nAt some point in the 1960s, following the US Supreme Court decision in \"Brown v Board of Education\", the black school in Ponce de Leon was closed, and students of color were integrated into the other local public schools. Some descendants of the Dominicker group still live in the area, but since World War II, many have scattered to other parts of the country. Those remaining in Holmes County and nearby localities have quietly assimilated into the white community, and there is no organized affiliation of Dominicker descendants.\n\nThe Dominickers are sometimes given a brief mention in sources discussing Melungeon people; however, there is no known link between the Dominickers and any other mixed-race group.\n\nOne source says that about 1857, over 100 mixed-race families migrated by wagon train from Holmes County to Rapides and Vernon parishes in Louisiana, where they became part of the people known as Redbones. The Redbones are well known in southwestern Louisiana, though their origins are still debated. A few links by marriage between members of that group and relatives of the Holmes County Dominickers are known, but there is no evidence at this time to suggest a common origin for the two groups. \n\nMany families in the Holmes County area claim Native American descent, especially from the Creek Indians, a nation with whom the Euchee were once affiliated. The local Choctawhatchee Creek are organized and said to be seeking state recognition.\n\n\n\n"}

During his college days a marked facility and grace in composition gave promise of his future literary success. At eighteen he entered the Society of Jesus. During his regular period of Jesuit probation and study his talents for preaching were discovered, and at the completion of his studies in 1690 he began his active career as a preacher, in which office he continued for ten years with remarkable success. In 1701 he founded the \"Journal de Trévoux\", and was an active member of its staff for twelve years. He died in Paris.\n\nWhile engaged in journalistic duties Catrou found time for historical research, and to his productions in this line his fame is chiefly due.\n\nThe \"Histoire generale de l'empire du Mogul\" was published in five duodecimo volumes in 1715. The matter was drawn, in the main, from the memoirs of the Venetian traveller Niccolao Manucci. It was translated into Italian as \"Istoria generale del Imperio del Mogul\" by Domenico Occhi and published in Venice in 1751. An English translation, the \"History of the Mogul Dynasty\" was published in London in 1826 and again, in 1907.\n\nCatrou's \"Histoire du fanatisme dans la religion protestante\" was a controversial work dealing principally with the Anabaptists and the Quakers. The best edition is that published in two duodecimo volumes in Paris in 1740.\n\nThe \"Histoire romaine\", with geographical and critical notes, was published in twenty-one quarto volumes between the years of 1725 and 1737. It was edited a second time in 1737. The notes are from the pen of P. Rouillé, S.J. This gigantic work was translated into Italian by Fra Zannino Marsecco in Venice in 1730-37, and into English by R. Bundy, as \"The Roman History with Notes, done into English from the Original French of the Rev. Fathers Catrou and Rouillé\" in London in 1728-37, in six folio volumes. The French work was highly praised at the time for its deep research and solid reasoning, but its somewhat pompous style soon brought severe censure from the critics. Its appearance in an English dress gave occasion to some very bitter attacks; but, though censured, this work provided inspiration to British historian Nathaniel Hooke, who in his \"Roman History\" drew freely from the text of Catrou and more freely from the critical notes of Rouillé.\n\nCatrou's translation of Virgil contained critical and historical notes. The translation is at all times free and not infrequently inaccurate. The notes and the accompanying life of Virgil manifest a thorough acquaintance with both poem and poet. Catrou's \"Virgil\" was a constant companion of the historian Edward Gibbon during his early studies. \"I always consulted the most learned and ingenious commentators\" he writes in his autobiography; \"Torrentius and Dacier on Horace, and Catrou and Servius on Virgil\".\n"}

{"id": "5139910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5139910", "title": "Homosexuality in ancient Rome", "text": "Homosexuality in ancient Rome\n\nHomosexuality in ancient Rome often differs markedly from the contemporary West. Latin lacks words that would precisely translate \"homosexual\" and \"heterosexual\". The primary dichotomy of ancient Roman sexuality was active/dominant/masculine and passive/submissive/feminine. Roman society was patriarchal, and the freeborn male citizen possessed political liberty (\"libertas\") and the right to rule both himself and his household (\"familia\"). \"Virtue\" (\"virtus\") was seen as an active quality through which a man (\"vir\") defined himself. The conquest mentality and \"cult of virility\" shaped same-sex relations. Roman men were free to enjoy sex with other males without a perceived loss of masculinity or social status, as long as they took the dominant or penetrative role. Acceptable male partners were slaves and former slaves, prostitutes, and entertainers, whose lifestyle placed them in the nebulous social realm of \"infamia\", excluded from the normal protections accorded a citizen even if they were technically free. Although Roman men in general seem to have preferred youths between the ages of 12 and 20 as sexual partners, freeborn male minors were off limits at certain periods of Rome, though professional prostitutes and entertainers might remain sexually available well into adulthood.\n\nSame-sex relations among women are far less documented. Although Roman women of the upper classes were educated and are known to have both written poetry and corresponded with male relatives, very few fragments of anything that might have been written by women survived. Male writers took little interest in how women experienced sexuality in general. During the Republic and early Principate, little is recorded of sexual relations among women, but better and more varied evidence, though scattered, exists for the later Imperial period.\n\nDuring the Republic, a Roman citizen's political liberty (\"libertas\") was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion, including both corporal punishment and sexual abuse. Roman society was patriarchal (see \"paterfamilias\"), and masculinity was premised on a capacity for governing oneself and others of lower status. \"Virtus\", \"valor\" as that which made a man most fully a man, was among the active virtues. Sexual conquest was a common metaphor for imperialism in Roman discourse, and the \"conquest mentality\" was part of a \"cult of virility\" that particularly shaped Roman homosexual practices. Roman ideals of masculinity were thus premised on taking an active role that was also, as Craig A. Williams has noted, \"the prime directive of masculine sexual behavior for Romans\". In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, scholars have tended to view expressions of Roman male sexuality in terms of a \"penetrator-penetrated\" binary model; that is, the proper way for a Roman male to seek sexual gratification was to insert his penis into his partner. Allowing himself to be penetrated threatened his liberty as a free citizen as well as his sexual integrity.\n\nIt was expected and socially acceptable for a freeborn Roman man to want sex with both female and male partners, as long as he took the penetrative role. The morality of the behavior depended on the social standing of the partner, not gender \"per se\". Both women and young men were considered normal objects of desire, but outside marriage a man was supposed to act on his desires with only slaves, prostitutes (who were often slaves), and the \"infames\". Gender did not determine whether a sexual partner was acceptable, as long as a man's enjoyment did not encroach on another man's integrity. It was immoral to have sex with another freeborn man's wife, his marriageable daughter, his underage son, or with the man himself; sexual use of another man's slave was subject to the owner's permission. Lack of self-control, including in managing one's sex life, indicated that a man was incapable of governing others; too much indulgence in \"low sensual pleasure\" threatened to erode the elite male's identity as a cultured person.\n\nHomoerotic themes are introduced to Latin literature during a period of increasing Greek influence on Roman culture in the 2nd century BC.\nGreek cultural attitudes differed from those of the Romans primarily in idealizing \"eros\" between freeborn male citizens of equal status, though usually with a difference of age (see \"Pederasty in ancient Greece\"). An attachment to a male outside the family, seen as a positive influence among the Greeks, within Roman society threatened the authority of the \"paterfamilias\". Since Roman women were active in educating their sons and mingled with men socially, and women of the governing classes often continued to advise and influence their sons and husbands in political life, homosociality was not as pervasive in Rome as it had been in Classical Athens, where it is thought to have contributed to the particulars of pederastic culture.\n\nIn the Imperial era, a perceived increase in passive homosexual behavior among free males was associated with anxieties about the subordination of political liberty to the emperor, and led to an increase in executions and corporal punishment. The sexual license and decadence under the empire was seen as a contributing factor and symptom of the loss of the ideals of physical integrity (\"libertas\") under the Republic.\n\nThe consul Quintus Lutatius Catulus was among a circle of poets who made short, light Hellenistic poems fashionable. One of his few surviving fragments is a poem of desire addressed to a male with a Greek name. The elevation of Greek literature and art as models of expression promoted the celebration of homoeroticism as the mark of an urbane and sophisticated person. No assumptions or generalizations should be made about any effect on sexual orientation or real-life behavior among the Romans.\n\n\"New poetry\" introduced at the end of the 2nd century included that of Gaius Valerius Catullus, whose work include expressing desire for a freeborn youth explicitly named \"Youth\" (\"Iuventius\"). The Latin name and freeborn status of the beloved subvert Roman tradition. Catullus's contemporary Lucretius also recognizes the attraction of \"boys\" (\"pueri\", which can designate an acceptable submissive partner and not specifically age). Homoerotic themes occur throughout the works of poets writing during the reign of Augustus, including elegies by Tibullus and Propertius, the second \"Eclogue\" of Vergil, and several poems by Horace. In the \"Aeneid,\" Vergil draws on the Greek tradition of pederasty in a military setting by portraying the love between Nisus and Euryalus, whose military valor marks them as solidly Roman men (\"viri\"). Vergil describes their love as \"pius\", linking it to the supreme virtue of \"pietas\" as possessed by the hero Aeneas himself, and endorsing it as \"honorable, dignified and connected to central Roman values\".\n\nBy the end of the Augustan period Ovid, Rome's leading literary figure, was alone among Roman figures in proposing a radically new agenda focused on love between men and women: making love with a woman is more enjoyable, he says, because unlike the forms of same-sex behavior permissible within Roman culture, the pleasure is mutual. Even Ovid himself, however, did not claim exclusive heterosexuality and he does include mythological treatments of homoeroticism in the \"Metamorphoses\", but Thomas Habinek has pointed out that the significance of Ovid's rupture of human erotics into categorical preferences has been obscured in the history of sexuality by a later heterosexual bias in Western culture.\n\nSeveral other Roman writers, however, expressed a bias in favor of males when sexual activity with males and females were compared, including Juvenal, Plutarch, Strato, and the poet Martial, who often derided women as sexual partners and celebrated the charms of \"pueri\". In literature of the Imperial period, the \"Satyricon\" of Petronius is so permeated with the culture of male–male sex that in 18th-century European literary circles, his name became \"a byword for homosexuality\".\n\nRepresentations of male–male and female–female sex are less common in art of ancient Rome than are male–female sex acts. A frieze at the Suburban Baths in Pompeii shows a series of sixteen sex scenes, including same-sex couples, and same-sex pairings as a part group sex acts.\nThreesomes in Roman art typically show two men penetrating a woman, but one of the Suburban scenes has one man entering a woman from the rear while he in turn receives anal sex from a man standing behind him. This scenario is described also by Catullus, \"Carmen\" 56, who considers it humorous. The man in the center may be a \"cinaedus\", a male who liked to receive anal sex but who was also considered seductive to women. Foursomes also appear in Roman art, typically with two women and two men, sometimes in same-sex pairings.\n\nRoman attitudes toward male nudity differ from those of the ancient Greeks, who regarded idealized portrayals of the nude male as an expression of masculine excellence. The wearing of the toga marked a Roman man as a free citizen. Negative connotations of nudity include defeat in war, since captives were stripped, and slavery, since slaves for sale were often displayed naked.\nAt the same time, the phallus was displayed ubiquitously in the form of the \"fascinum\", a magic charm thought to ward off malevolent forces; it became a customary decoration, found widely in the ruins of Pompeii, especially in the form of wind chimes (\"tintinnabula\"). The outsized phallus of the god Priapus may originally have served an apotropaic purpose, but in art it is frequently laughter-provoking or grotesque. Hellenization, however, influenced the depiction of male nudity in Roman art, leading to more complex signification of the male body shown nude, partially nude, or costumed in a muscle cuirass.\n\nThe Warren Cup is a piece of convivial silver, usually dated to the time of the Julio-Claudian dynasty (1st century AD), that depicts two scenes of male–male sex. It has been argued that the two sides of this cup represent the duality of pederastic tradition at Rome, the Greek in contrast to the Roman. On the \"Greek\" side, a bearded, mature man is penetrating a young but muscularly developed male in a rear-entry position. The young man, probably meant to be 17 or 18, holds on to a sexual apparatus for maintaining an otherwise awkward or uncomfortable sexual position. A child-slave watches the scene furtively through a door ajar. The \"Roman\" side of the cup shows a \"puer delicatus\", age 12 to 13, held for intercourse in the arms of an older male, clean-shaven and fit. The bearded pederast may be Greek, with a partner who participates more freely and with a look of pleasure. His counterpart, who has a more severe haircut, appears to be Roman, and thus uses a slave boy; the myrtle wreath he wears symbolizes his role as an \"erotic conqueror\". The cup may have been designed as a conversation piece to provoke the kind of dialogue on ideals of love and sex that took place at a Greek symposium. The antiquity of the Warren Cup has been challenged, and it may instead represent perceptions of Greco-Roman homosexuality at the time of its manufacture, possibly the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nA man or boy who took the \"receptive\" role in sex was variously called \"cinaedus\", \"pathicus\", \"exoletus\", \"concubinus\" (male concubine), \"spintria\" (\"analist\"), \"puer\" (\"boy\"), \"pullus\" (\"chick\"), \"pusio\", \"delicatus\" (especially in the phrase \"puer delicatus\", \"exquisite\" or \"dainty boy\"), \"mollis\" (\"soft\", used more generally as an aesthetic quality counter to aggressive masculinity), \"tener\" (\"delicate\"), \"debilis\" (\"weak\" or \"disabled\"), \"effeminatus\", \"discinctus\" (\"loose-belted\"), \"pisciculi,\" \"spinthriae,\" and \"morbosus\" (\"sick\"). As Amy Richlin has noted, \"'gay' is not exact, 'penetrated' is not self-defined, 'passive' misleadingly connotes inaction\" in translating this group of words into English.\n\nSome terms, such as \"exoletus\", specifically refer to an adult; Romans who were socially marked as \"masculine\" did not confine their same-sex penetration of male prostitutes or slaves to those who were \"boys\" under the age of 20. Some older men may have at times preferred the passive role. Martial describes, for example, the case of an older man who played the passive role and let a younger slave occupy the active role. An adult male's desire to be penetrated was considered a sickness (\"morbus\"); the desire to penetrate a handsome youth was thought normal.\n\"Cinaedus\" is a derogatory word denoting a male who was gender-deviant; his choice of sex acts, or preference in sexual partner, was secondary to his perceived deficiencies as a \"man\" (\"vir\"). Catullus directs the slur \"cinaedus\" at his friend Furius in his notoriously obscene \"Carmen\" 16. Although in some contexts \"cinaedus\" may denote an anally passive man and is the most frequent word for a male who allowed himself to be penetrated anally, a man called \"cinaedus\" might also have sex with and be considered highly attractive to women. \"Cinaedus\" is not equivalent to the English vulgarism \"faggot\", except that both words can be used to deride a male considered deficient in manhood or with androgynous characteristics whom women may find sexually alluring.\n\nThe clothing, use of cosmetics, and mannerisms of a \"cinaedus\" marked him as effeminate, but the same effeminacy that Roman men might find alluring in a \"puer\" became unattractive in the physically mature male. The \"cinaedus\" thus represented the absence of what Romans considered true manhood, and the word is virtually untranslatable into English.\n\nOriginally, a \"cinaedus\" (Greek \"kinaidos\") was a professional dancer, characterized as non-Roman or \"Eastern\"; the word itself may come from a language of Asia Minor. His performance featured tambourine-playing and movements of the buttocks that suggested anal intercourse.\n\nSome Roman men kept a male concubine (\"concubinus\", \"one who lies with; a bed-mate\") before they married a woman. Eva Cantarella has described this form of concubinage as \"a stable sexual relationship, not exclusive but privileged\". Within the hierarchy of household slaves, the \"concubinus\" seems to have been regarded as holding a special or elevated status that was threatened by the introduction of a wife. In a wedding hymn, Catullus portrays the groom's \"concubinus\" as anxious about his future and fearful of abandonment. His long hair will be cut, and he will have to resort to the female slaves for sexual gratification—indicating that he is expected to transition from being a receptive sex object to one who performs penetrative sex. The \"concubinus\" might father children with women of the household, not excluding the wife (at least in invective). The feelings and situation of the \"concubinus\" are treated as significant enough to occupy five stanzas of Catullus's wedding poem. He plays an active role in the ceremonies, distributing the traditional nuts that boys threw (rather like rice or birdseed in the modern Western tradition).\n\nThe relationship with a \"concubinus\" might be discreet or more open: male concubines sometimes attended dinner parties with the man whose companion they were. Martial even suggests that a prized \"concubinus\" might pass from father to son as an especially coveted inheritance. A military officer on campaign might be accompanied by a \"concubinus\". Like the catamite or \"puer delicatus\", the role of the concubine was regularly compared to that of Ganymede, the Trojan prince abducted by Jove (Greek Zeus) to serve as his cupbearer.\n\nThe \"concubina\", a female concubine who might be free, held a protected legal status under Roman law, but the \"concubinus\" did not, since he was typically a slave.\n\n\"Pathicus\" was a \"blunt\" word for a male who was penetrated sexually. It derived from the unattested Greek adjective \"pathikos\", from the verb \"paskhein\", equivalent to the Latin deponent \"patior, pati, passus\", \"undergo, submit to, endure, suffer\". The English word \"passive\" derives from the Latin \"passus\".\n\n\"Pathicus\" and \"cinaedus\" are often not distinguished in usage by Latin writers, but \"cinaedus\" may be a more general term for a male not in conformity with the role of \"vir\", a \"real man\", while \"pathicus\" specifically denotes an adult male who takes the sexually receptive role. A \"pathicus\" was not a \"homosexual\" as such. His sexuality was not defined by the gender of the person using him as a receptacle for sex, but rather his desire to be so used. Because in Roman culture a man who penetrates another adult male almost always expresses contempt or revenge, the \"pathicus\" might be seen as more akin to the sexual masochist in his experience of pleasure. He might be penetrated orally or anally by a man or by a woman with a dildo, but showed no desire for penetrating nor having his own penis stimulated. He might also be dominated by a woman who compels him to perform cunnilingus.\n\nIn the discourse of sexuality, \"puer\" (\"boy\") was a role as well as an age group. Both \"puer\" and the feminine equivalent \"puella\", \"girl\", could refer to a man's sexual partner, regardless of age. As an age designation, the freeborn \"puer\" made the transition from childhood at around age 14, when he assumed the \"toga of manhood\", but he was 17 or 18 before he began to take part in public life. A slave would never be considered a \"vir\", a \"real man\"; he would be called \"puer\", \"boy\", throughout his life. \"Pueri\" might be \"functionally interchangeable\" with women as receptacles for sex, but freeborn male minors were strictly off-limits. To accuse a Roman man of being someone's \"boy\" was an insult that impugned his manhood, particularly in the political arena. The aging \"cinaedus\" or an anally passive man might wish to present himself as a \"puer\".\n\nThe \"puer delicatus\" was an \"exquisite\" or \"dainty\" child-slave chosen by his master for his beauty as a \"boy toy\", also referred to as \"deliciae\" (\"sweets\" or \"delights\"). Unlike the freeborn Greek \"eromenos\" (\"beloved\"), who was protected by social custom, the Roman \"delicatus\" was in a physically and morally vulnerable position. The \"coercive and exploitative\" relationship between the Roman master and the \"delicatus\", who might be prepubescent, can be characterized as pedophilic, in contrast to Greek \"paiderasteia\". The boy was sometimes castrated in an effort to preserve his youthful qualities; the emperor Nero had a \"puer delicatus\" named Sporus, whom he castrated and married.\n\n\"Pueri delicati\" might be idealized in poetry. In the erotic elegies of Tibullus, the \"delicatus\" Marathus wears lavish and expensive clothing. The beauty of the \"delicatus\" was measured by Apollonian standards, especially in regard to his long hair, which was supposed to be wavy, fair, and scented with perfume. The mythological type of the \"delicatus\" was represented by Ganymede, the Trojan youth abducted by Jove (Greek Zeus) to be his divine companion and cupbearer. In the \"Satyricon\", the tastelessly wealthy freedman Trimalchio says that as a child-slave he had been a \"puer delicatus\" servicing both the master and the mistress of the household.\n\n\"Pullus\" was a term for a young animal, and particularly a chick. It was an affectionate word traditionally used for a boy (\"puer\") who was loved by someone \"in an obscene sense\".\n\nThe lexicographer Festus provides a definition and illustrates with a comic anecdote. Quintus Fabius Maximus Eburnus, a consul in 116 BC and later a censor known for his moral severity, earned his \"cognomen\" meaning \"Ivory\" (the modern equivalent might be \"Porcelain\") because of his fair good looks (\"candor\"). Eburnus was said to have been struck by lightning on his buttocks, perhaps a reference to a birthmark. It was joked that he was marked as \"Jove's chick\" (\"pullus Iovis\"), since the characteristic instrument of the king of the gods was the lightning bolt (see also the relation of Jove's cupbearer Ganymede to \"catamite\"). Although the sexual inviolability of underage male citizens is usually emphasized, this anecdote is among the evidence that even the most well-born youths might go through a phase in which they could be viewed as \"sex objects\". Perhaps tellingly, this same member of the illustrious Fabius family ended his life in exile, as punishment for killing his own son for \"impudicitia\".\n\nThe 4th-century Gallo-Roman poet Ausonius records the word \"pullipremo\", \"chick-squeezer\", which he says was used by the early satirist Lucilius.\n\n\"Pusio\" is etymologically related to \"puer,\" and means \"boy, lad\". It often had a distinctly sexual or sexually demeaning connotation. Juvenal indicates the \"pusio\" was more desirable than women because he was less quarrelsome and would not demand gifts from his lover. \"Pusio\" was also used as a personal name (\"cognomen\").\n\n\"Scultimidonus\" (\"asshole-bestower\") was rare and \"florid\" slang that appears in a fragment from the early Roman satirist Lucilius. It is glossed as \"Those who bestow for free their \"scultima\", that is, their anal orifice, which is called the \"scultima\" as if from the inner parts of whores\" (\"scortorum intima\").\n\nThe abstract noun \"impudicitia\" (adjective \"impudicus\") was the negation of \"pudicitia\", \"sexual morality, chastity\". As a characteristic of males, it often implies the willingness to be penetrated. Dancing was an expression of male \"impudicitia\".\n\n\"Impudicitia\" might be associated with behaviors in young men who retained a degree of boyish attractiveness but were old enough to be expected to behave according to masculine norms. Julius Caesar was accused of bringing the notoriety of \"infamia\" upon himself, both when he was about 19, for taking the passive role in an affair with King Nicomedes of Bithynia, and later for many adulterous affairs with women. Seneca the Elder noted that \"\"impudicita\" is a crime for the freeborn, a necessity in a slave, a duty for the freedman\": male–male sex in Rome asserted the power of the citizen over slaves, confirming his masculinity.\n\nLatin had such a wealth of words for men outside the masculine norm that some scholars argue for the existence of a homosexual subculture at Rome; that is, although the noun \"homosexual\" has no straightforward equivalent in Latin, literary sources reveal a pattern of behaviors among a minority of free men that indicate same-sex preference or orientation. Plautus mentions a street known for male prostitutes. Public baths are also referred to as a place to find sexual partners. Juvenal states that such men scratched their heads with a finger to identify themselves.\n\nApuleius indicates that \"cinaedi\" might form social alliances for mutual enjoyment, such as hosting dinner parties. In his novel \"The Golden Ass\", he describes one group who jointly purchased and shared a \"concubinus\". On one occasion, they invited a \"well-endowed\" young hick (\"rusticanus iuvenis\") to their party, and took turns performing oral sex on him.\n\nOther scholars, primarily those who argue from the perspective of \"cultural constructionism\", maintain that there is not an identifiable social group of males who would have self-identified as \"homosexual\" as a community.\n\nAlthough in general the Romans regarded marriage as a male–female union for the purpose of producing children, a few scholars believe that in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating traditional marriage rites in the presence of friends. male–male weddings are reported by sources that mock them; the feelings of the participants are not recorded. Both Martial and Juvenal refer to marriage between males as something that occurs not infrequently, although they disapprove of it. Roman law did not recognize marriage between males, but one of the grounds for disapproval expressed in Juvenal's satire is that celebrating the rites would lead to expectations for such marriages to be registered officially. As the empire was becoming Christianized in the 4th century, legal prohibitions against marriage between males began to appear.\n\nVarious ancient sources state that the emperor Nero celebrated two public weddings with men, once taking the role of the bride (with a freedman Pythagoras), and once the groom (with Sporus); there may have been a third in which he was the bride. The ceremonies included traditional elements such as a dowry and the wearing of the Roman bridal veil. In the early 3rd century AD, the emperor Elagabalus is reported to have been the bride in a wedding to his male partner. Other mature men at his court had husbands, or said they had husbands in imitation of the emperor. Although the sources are in general hostile, Dio Cassius implies that Nero's stage performances were regarded as more scandalous than his marriages to men.\n\nThe earliest reference in Latin literature to a marriage between males occurs in the \"Philippics\" of Cicero, who insulted Mark Antony for being a slut in his youth until Curio \"established you in a fixed and stable marriage (\"matrimonium\"), as if he had given you a \"stola\"\", the traditional garment of a married woman. Although Cicero's sexual implications are clear, the point of the passage is to cast Antony in the submissive role in the relationship and to impugn his manhood in various ways; there is no reason to think that actual marriage rites were performed.\n\nRoman law addressed the rape of a male citizen as early as the 2nd century BC, when it was ruled that even a man who was \"disreputable and questionable\" (\"famosus,\" related to \"infamis\", and \"suspiciosus)\" had the same right as other free men not to have his body subjected to forced sex. The \"Lex Julia de vi publica\", recorded in the early 3rd century AD but probably dating from the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, defined rape as forced sex against \"boy, woman, or anyone\"; the rapist was subject to execution, a rare penalty in Roman law. Men who had been raped were exempt from the loss of legal or social standing suffered by those who submitted their bodies to use for the pleasure of others; a male prostitute or entertainer was \"infamis\" and excluded from the legal protections extended to citizens in good standing. As a matter of law, a slave could not be raped; he was considered property and not legally a person. The slave's owner, however, could prosecute the rapist for property damage.\n\nFears of mass rape following a military defeat extended equally to male and female potential victims. According to the jurist Pomponius, \"whatever man has been raped by the force of robbers or the enemy in wartime\" ought to bear no stigma.\n\nThe threat of one man to subject another to anal or oral rape (\"irrumatio\") is a theme of invective poetry, most notably in Catullus's notorious \"Carmen\" 16, and was a form of masculine braggadocio. Rape was one of the traditional punishments inflicted on a male adulterer by the wronged husband, though perhaps more in revenge fantasy than in practice.\n\nIn a collection of twelve anecdotes dealing with assaults on chastity, the historian Valerius Maximus features male victims in equal number to female. In a \"mock trial\" case described by the elder Seneca, an \"adulescens\" (a man young enough not to have begun his formal career) was gang-raped by ten of his peers; although the case is hypothetical, Seneca assumes that the law permitted the successful prosecution of the rapists. Another hypothetical case imagines the extremity to which a rape victim might be driven: the freeborn male (\"ingenuus\") who was raped commits suicide. The Romans considered the rape of an \"ingenuus\" to be among the worst crimes that could be committed, along with parricide, the rape of a female virgin, and robbing a temple.\n\nThe Roman soldier, like any free and respectable Roman male of status, was expected to show self-discipline in matters of sex. Augustus (reigned 27 BC – 14 AD) even prohibited soldiers from marrying, a ban that remained in force for the Imperial army for nearly two centuries. Other forms of sexual gratification available to soldiers were prostitutes of any gender, male slaves, war rape, and same-sex relations. The \"Bellum Hispaniense\", about Caesar's civil war on the front in Roman Spain, mentions an officer who has a male concubine (\"concubinus\") on campaign. Sex among fellow soldiers, however, violated the Roman decorum against intercourse with another freeborn male. A soldier maintained his masculinity by not allowing his body to be used for sexual purposes.\n\nIn warfare, rape symbolized defeat, a motive for the soldier not to make his body sexually vulnerable in general. During the Republic, homosexual behavior among fellow soldiers was subject to harsh penalties, including death, as a violation of military discipline. Polybius (2nd century BC) reports that the punishment for a soldier who willingly submitted to penetration was the \"fustuarium\", clubbing to death.\n\nRoman historians record cautionary tales of officers who abuse their authority to coerce sex from their soldiers, and then suffer dire consequences. The youngest officers, who still might retain some of the adolescent attraction that Romans favored in male–male relations, were advised to beef up their masculine qualities by not wearing perfume, nor trimming nostril and underarm hair. An incident related by Plutarch in his biography of Marius illustrates the soldier's right to maintain his sexual integrity despite pressure from his superiors. A good-looking young recruit named Trebonius had been sexually harassed over a period of time by his superior officer, who happened to be Marius's nephew, Gaius Luscius. One night, after having fended off unwanted advances on numerous occasions, Trebonius was summoned to Luscius's tent. Unable to disobey the command of his superior, he found himself the object of a sexual assault and drew his sword, killing Luscius. A conviction for killing an officer typically resulted in execution. When brought to trial, he was able to produce witnesses to show that he had repeatedly had to fend off Luscius, and \"had never prostituted his body to anyone, despite offers of expensive gifts\". Marius not only acquitted Trebonius in the killing of his kinsman, but gave him a crown for bravery.\n\nIn addition to repeatedly described anal intercourse, oral sex was common. A graffito from Pompeii is unambiguous: \"Secundus is a fellator of rare ability\" (\"Secundus felator rarus\"). In contrast to ancient Greece, a large penis was a major element in attractiveness. Petronius describes a man with a large penis in a public bathroom. Several emperors are reported in a negative light for surrounding themselves with men with large sexual organs.\n\nThe Gallo-Roman poet Ausonius (4th century AD) makes a joke about a male threesome that depends on imagining the configurations of group sex:\n\"Three men in bed together: two are sinning, two are sinned against.\"\"Doesn't that make four men?\"\"You're mistaken: the man on either end is implicated once, but the one in the middle does double duty.\"\n\nIn other words, a 'train' is being alluded to: the first man penetrates the second, who in turn penetrates the third. The first two are \"sinning\", while the last two are being \"sinned against\".\n\nReferences to sex between women are infrequent in the Roman literature of the Republic and early Principate. Ovid finds it \"a desire known to no one, freakish, novel ... among all animals no female is seized by desire for female\". During the Roman Imperial era, sources for same-sex relations among women are more abundant, in the form of love spells, medical writing, texts on astrology and the interpretation of dreams, and other sources. A graffito from Pompeii expresses the desire of one woman for another:\n\nI wish I could hold to my neck and embrace the little arms, and bear kisses on the tender lips. Go on, doll, and trust your joys to the winds; believe me, light is the nature of men.\n\nGreek words for a woman who prefers sex with another woman include \"hetairistria\" (compare \"hetaira\", \"courtesan\" or \"companion\"), \"tribas\" (plural \"tribades\"), and \"Lesbia\"; Latin words include the loanword \"tribas\", \"fricatrix\" (\"she who rubs\"), and \"virago\". An early reference to same-sex relations among women is found in the Roman-era Greek writer Lucian (2nd century CE): \"They say there are women like that in Lesbos, masculine-looking, but they don't want to give it up for men. Instead, they consort with women, just like men.\"\n\nSince Romans thought a sex act required an active or dominant partner who was \"phallic\", male writers imagined that in female–female sex one of the women would use a dildo or have an exceptionally large clitoris for penetration, and that she would be the one experiencing pleasure. Dildos are rarely mentioned in Roman sources, but were a popular comic item in Classical Greek literature and art. There is only one known depiction of a woman penetrating another woman in Roman art, whereas women using dildos is common in Greek vase painting.\n\nMartial describes women acting sexually actively with other women as having outsized sexual appetites and performing penetrative sex on both women and boys. Imperial portrayals of women who sodomize boys, drink and eat like men, and engage in vigorous physical regimens may reflect cultural anxieties about the growing independence of Roman women. Alternatively, it may also simply describe a common behavior that is experienced even in Western culture today.\n\nCross-dressing appears in Roman literature and art in various ways to mark the uncertainties and ambiguities of gender:\n\nA section of the \"Digest\" by Ulpian categorizes Roman clothing on the basis of who may appropriately wear it: \"vestimenta virilia\", \"men's clothing\", is defined as the attire of the \"paterfamilias\", \"head of household\"; \"puerilia\" is clothing that serves no purpose other than to mark its wearer as a \"child\" or minor; \"muliebria\" are the garments that characterize a \"materfamilias\"; \"communia\", those that are \"common\", that is, worn by either sex; and \"familiarica\", clothing for the \"familia\", the subordinates in a household, including the staff and slaves. A man who wore women's clothes, Ulpian notes, would risk making himself the object of scorn. Female prostitutes were the only women in ancient Rome who wore the distinctively masculine toga. The wearing of the toga may signal that prostitutes were outside the normal social and legal category of \"woman\".\n\nA fragment from the playwright Accius (170–86 BC) seems to refer to a father who secretly wore \"virgin's finery\". An instance of transvestism is noted in a legal case, in which \"a certain senator accustomed to wear women's evening clothes\" was disposing of the garments in his will. In the \"mock trial\" exercise presented by the elder Seneca, the young man (\"adulescens\") was gang-raped while wearing women's clothes in public, but his attire is explained as his acting on a dare by his friends, not as a choice based on gender identity or the pursuit of erotic pleasure.\n\nGender ambiguity was a characteristic of the priests of the goddess Cybele known as Galli, whose ritual attire included items of women’s clothing. They are sometimes considered a transgender or transsexual priesthood, since they were required to be castrated in imitation of Attis. The complexities of gender identity in the religion of Cybele and the Attis myth are explored by Catullus in one of his longest poems, \"Carmen\" 63.\n\nMacrobius describes a masculine form of \"Venus\" (Aphrodite) who received cult on Cyprus; she had a beard and male genitals, but wore women's clothing. The deity's worshippers cross-dressed, men wearing women's clothes, and women men's. The Latin poet Laevius wrote of worshipping \"nurturing Venus\" whether female or male (\"sive femina sive mas\"). The figure was sometimes called \"Aphroditos\". In several surviving examples of Greek and Roman sculpture, the love goddess pulls up her garments to reveal her male genitalia, a gesture that traditionally held apotropaic or magical power.\n\nPliny notes that \"there are even those who are born of both sexes, whom we call hermaphrodites, at one time \"androgyni\"\" (\"andr-\", \"man\", and \"gyn-\", \"woman\", from the Greek). Some commentators see hermaphroditism as a \"violation of social boundaries, especially those as fundamental to daily life as male and female\". The era also saw an historical account of a congenital eunuch.\n\nAttitudes toward same-sex behavior changed as Christianity became more prominent in the Empire. The modern perception of Roman sexual decadence can be traced to early Christian polemic. Apart from measures to protect the liberty of citizens, the prosecution of male–male sex as a general crime began in the 3rd century when male prostitution was banned by Philip the Arab. A series of laws regulating male–male sex were promulgated during the social crisis of the 3rd century, from the statutory rape of minors to marriage between males.\n\nBy the end of the 4th century, anally passive men under the Christian Empire were punished by burning. \"Death by sword\" was the punishment for a \"man coupling like a woman\" under the Theodosian Code. It is in the 6th century, under Justinian, that legal and moral discourse on male–male sex becomes distinctly Christian: all male–male sex, passive or active, no matter who the partners, was declared contrary to nature and punishable by death. Male–male sex was pointed to as cause for God's wrath following a series of disasters around 542 and 559.\n\n\n"}

He was executed during the Reign of Terror of Pablo Morillo after the Spanish invasion of New Granada.\n\nCamacho was born on July 17, 1766, in Tunja, which was part of the Viceroyalty of the New Granada, now Colombia. His parents were Francisco Camacho y Solórzano and Rosa Rodríguez de Lago y Castillo. He attended Our Lady of the Rosary University where he studied Jurisprudence. He was admitted as a lawyer by the Royal Audiency of Santafé de Bogotá in the year 1792. He became one of the most important lawyers of the viceroyalty and winning the admiration of his colleagues.\n\nOn June 13, 1793, Camacho married Marcelina Rodríguez de Lago y Castillo, a member of the prominent Sanz de Santamaría family on her mother’s side. Together they had three children.\n\nResponding to a prize competition in 1808 by philanthropist Nicolás Manuel Tanco, Camacho wrote \"Memoria sobre la causa y curación de los cotos\", an account on the cause and treatment for goitre; this remarkable work won the competition. The competition was a response to the situation of Bogotá, which at the time was having a small epidemic of goiter.\n\nCamacho wrote for the \"Seminario del Nuevo Reino de Granada\", a newsletter edited by Francisco José de Caldas, its most important contribution was in 1809, \"Relación territorial de la provincia de Pamplona en el Nuevo Reino de Granada\", an extensive account of the Province of Pamplona at the end of the Colonial Period. In it is described its main cities, the fauna and flora of the region, the provincial limits and borders, and other geographical and botanical information about Pamplona.\n\nCamacho started venturing more into journalism in 1810, when he co-edited the newspaper \"Diario Político\", with Francisco José de Caldas. The Diario Politico first came out on August 27, 1810, and contained political articles related with the events of July 20 then on. It ran three editions per week till February 1811.\n\nOn July 19, 1810, the precursors of the independence - Camilo Torres Tenorio, José Acevedo Gómez, José Miguel Pey and Jorge Tadeo Lozano, among others - held a secret meeting in the Astronomic Observatory of Bogotá, the office of Francisco José de Caldas. They had been informed of a plan by the Spaniards to arrest prominent criollos who had ideas of independence; the precursors were determined to win their independence and they, that night, planned the revolution. They were also convinced that the upcoming visit of the Regency Commissioners, Antonio Villavicencio and Carlos Montúfar, would bring the same results it had in Cartagena de Indias. Camilo Torres proposed that the first strike had to come from the Spaniards, to incite the people for an uprising and to prevent their supporters from doing something about it. Camacho would go to the house of the viceroy and ask him to allow a Junta to take place: they knew that he was going to oppose this, but would use it as the Spaniards' way of undermining the American people. Meanwhile, Luis de Rubio and Antonio Morales would go to the house of José Gonzales Llorente and start a mob uprising with the excuse of borrowing a flower vase, something they knew he would refuse giving Llorente's reputation.\n\nThe next day, Friday July 20, 1810, everything went according to their plan, and by night they had assembled an Open Cabildo. Don Camacho was part of this Cabildo, which wrote the first Declaration of Independence of Colombia, the \"Acta del Cabildo Extraordinario de Santa Fe\", which declared the Viceroyalty of New Granada independent. Camacho was one its signers.\n\nCamacho also participated in the Congress of the United Provinces of the New Granada, which was convened in Villa de Leiva, as a Deputy Representative for the Province of Tunja.\n\nOn October 5, 1814, the Congress of the United Provinces changed the Presidency of the United Provinces and replaced it with a Triumvirate, a three-member executive body. Congress nominated Custodio García Rovira, Manuel Rodríguez Torices and José Manuel Restrepo for the triumvirate, but they were all unable to assume the presidency, so Congress replaced them with José María del Castillo y Rada, José Fernández Madrid, and Camacho. Camacho exercised the executive power till January 2, 1815.\n\nCamacho was sentenced to death by Pablo Morillo and the War Council on August 31, 1816 and was executed by a firing squad on the same day, at the age of fifty. He was sick, blind and paralyzed and had to be carried in his wheelchair up the platform designated for his execution.\n\nWhen Camacho died, his family was oppressed by the Terror Regime until the liberation by Simón Bolívar in 1819. His wife asked the Libertador to grant her a pension for her husband's sacrifice to the Nation. Bolívar personally asked congress for this and in 1820 a pension was given to her in his name. His daughter, Indalecia Camacho, who was also blind, received a pension from Congress on May 26, 1869. His niece, Juana Martínez Camacho, married Antonio Ricaurte.\n\n"}

She later became well known for her work with Indigenous Australian children who were selected according to a criterion of skin colour and sent to her homes to groom the young \"nearly white\" children for absorption into the white community. These children would later be described as part of the \"Stolen Generation\".\n\nClutterbuck was the daughter of well-off parents, Captain Clutterbuck and his wife.\n\nClutterbuck was awarded an Order of the British Empire (Member of the Civil Division), on 1 January 1934, for her services to disadvantaged children.\n\nIn December 2006, the \"West Australian\" newspaper published a list entitled the \"100 Most Influential Western Australians\" which included Clutterbuck. The list was developed by a committee including several eminent Western Australian historians.\n\nIn 1881 Clutterbuck joined the Community of the Sisters of the Church, a Church of England order founded in London in 1870 by Mother Emily Ayckbowm. Now referred to as \"Sister Kate\", Clutterbuck worked with orphans in the London slums for 17 years until 1901 when she and several other sisters were sent to Western Australia to establish a girls' school and orphanage. She arrived in Western Australia in December 1901 with Sister Sarah and 22 orphaned English children aged between 6 and 10 in her care.\n\nWhile the other sisters of her order set about the establishment of founding a church school (now Perth College), Clutterbuck and Sister Sarah set out to establish a home for orphaned babies. Temporary premises in William Street, Perth were used while a permanent children's home in the country was located. The nuns purchased a block at Parkerville in the Darling Range. Clutterbuck took up residence in 1903 with eight children in an old hut and bark roofed barn which she named The League of Charity Homes for Waifs and Stray Babies and which was later expanded to become Parkerville Children's Home. Forty-five children were being fostered by 1905 and, thanks to a benefactor, Walter Padbury, a large stone nursery was built. Other improvements included a 6000-gallon (27,000-litre) water tank and 120 acres (50 ha) of land partially planted with fruit trees as well as a carriage and horse. The state government provided some funding and by 1911, 100 children were living there. Another two sisters were recruited from England and the building were extended to include a dining-room, schoolhouse and kitchen.\n\nFor nearly 30 years Clutterbuck ran the home where over 800 disadvantaged children passed through her care. In 1927 the home was taken over by the Diocese of Perth and in 1930 she retired at the age of 70. She was awarded an MBE the following year.\n\nParkerville continues to be operated today as accommodation for disadvantaged children. A small river in the vicinity of the home is named Clutterbuck Creek.\n\nFriend and associate Ruth Lefroy shared an interest in the welfare of Aboriginal children. In 1932, Lefroy purchased a property in Neville Street, Bayswater called the Children's Cottage Home which was run by Clutterbuck. Another house used as a holiday home was acquired in Beach Street, Mosman Park. The home was funded by government subsidies from the Native Welfare and Child Welfare Departments, as well as fêtes, jumble sales, donations and street collections.\n\nAt this time A. O. Neville, the government Chief Protector of Aboriginals, was the architect of an official scheme which oversaw the care, custody and education of Aboriginal and half-caste children under 16 years in the state. The scheme's purpose was to integrate young and part Aboriginal children into white society by separating them from their families. The process by which the separation was done has been widely condemned since a report entitled \"Bringing Them Home\" was published in 1997 following a federal government inquiry. These people are now known as the Stolen Generations.\n\nAs part of the scheme, Neville directed young Aboriginal children and babies into the Children's Cottage Home run by Clutterbuck.\n\nIn June 1934, Clutterbuck and Ruth Lefroy relocated the home with ten school-aged children to a new site on Railway Street (now Treasure Road), Queens Park. The new six-roomed home was named \"Myola\" and had been purpose built with the help of private sponsorship. Due to a measles epidemic, the cottage was soon extended to create a ward where sick children could be isolated and nursed. In 1935 a kitchen and a second cottage, \"Friendly Cottage\", were built on the site to accommodate younger children. At this time Queens Park was a relatively undeveloped suburb although the cottage was well located with a school and train station nearby. Towards the end of 1936, Neville began negotiations on behalf of Clutterbuck for the purchase of land immediately adjacent to the home. An adjoining 5.25 acres (2 hectares) was acquired at a cost of £85 in January 1937 using funds donated by a benefactor. The same person also donated funds to extend the second cottage and to build a third cottage and a chapel. This third cottage was known as \"Nursery Cottage\" and the chapel was named the \"Chapel of the Guardian Angel\".\n\nNeville supposedly reproached Sister Kate for building the chapel, suggesting that the funds should have been spent on the children.\n\nChurch services, Sunday School and daily prayers were conducted in the new chapel on a regular basis. A morning service conducted by Sister Kate was conducted each morning. The chapel was very important to Sister Kate: according to Vera Whittington\nShe refused to have the building dedicated, believing that its non-denominational status would encourage patronage by the children, and it was not until after her death in February 1948 that Anglican Archbishop Moline dedicated the chapel. In 1937, fund-raising by a group known as the 'Virgillians', led by Mary Durack, enabled further development of the site and in 1938–41 a kindergarten and another cottage were constructed.\n\nWith the onset of World War 2 most of the children were evacuated to the Duke of York Hotel at Greenbushes. Some children required specialised medical attention and attendance at Perth hospitals however, and so Ruth Lefroy purchased a cottage at Roleystone. After the war, the Roleystone property was sold and the proceeds used to pay for the construction of 'Memorial cottage'.\n\nIn 1946, funds from the Lotteries Commission helped build 'Gran's Cottage' (as she was then known) as a private residence for Sister Kate. Soon after however, she died suddenly at Tresillian Hospital in Nedlands at the age of 86.\n\nMost of her foster-children were with her from babyhood to maturity: they called her 'Mum', and in later years 'Gran'. She was not a big woman and was said to have an English complexion, and radiated kindliness with a quiet strength that won respect and confidence from young and old. Always full of sympathy, she had a kindly understanding nature and was always able to offer advice for the children which she treated as her own.\n\nA committee then administered the home, with the position of Superintendent Matron taken over by Ruth Lefroy. The Queens Park complex, which by this time comprised seven cottages as well as the chapel and kindergarten, became known as \"Sister Kate's Children's Cottages\" in recognition of her work. Ruth Lefroy died in 1953 and her will made provision for the ownership of the property to be donated to the Presbyterian Church, now part of the Uniting Church in Australia.\n\nDean Collard was appointed Director of the Cottages in August 1987.\n\nIn 1988, the cottages were renamed as \"Manguri\". The organisation continues today to provide Aboriginal child-care services.\n\n\n\n"}

It is now preserved at the Science Museum, London.\n\nIt is important as both an early example of a beam engine by Boulton and Watt, and also mainly as illustrating an important innovative step in their development for its ability to produce rotary motion.\n\nThe engines name comes from its use in Matthew Boulton's Soho Manufactory, where it was used to drive a line of 43 polishing or lapping machines, used for the production of buttons and buckles.\n\nWatt did not invent the steam engine and there is no single 'Watt steam engine' as such. He developed a number of separate innovations, each of which improved the existing engines of the day, beginning with Newcomen's. The Lap Engine of 1788, also the Whitbread Engine (1785), represent survivors of the first engines to show all of Watt's major improvements in one.\n\nThe rotative beam engine needs a means to convert reciprocating motion of the piston and beam to rotary motion. The crankshaft was well known for centuries before Watt, mostly from its use in mining machinery powered by water wheels. However its use for a steam engine was covered by James Pickard's patent at this time. Watt was unwilling to pay a license fee to use the crank and so sought an alternative. The sun and planet gear was invented by another Scottish engineer, William Murdoch, an employee of Boulton and Watt. Watt patented it in October 1781.\n\nThe sun and planet gear is a simple epicyclic gear. The planet is attached rigidly to the end of the connecting rod, hung from the beam. As it rotates it applies a torque to the sun gear, just as for a crank, and so causes it to rotate. As the two gears also rotate relative to each other, like conventional gearwheels, this has the effect of giving the sun gear a further rotation. The sun, and the output crankshaft, thus rotates twice for every piston cycle of the engine, twice as fast as with a conventional crank. Beam engines were slow-moving and the output shafts driven by the Lap Engine were fast-moving, so this was an advantage.\n\nAccording to the Science Museum, it was the first steam engine to be fitted with a centrifugal governor.\n"}
{"id": "2287895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2287895", "title": "Late Middle Ages", "text": "Late Middle Ages\n\nThe Late Middle Ages or Late Medieval Period was the period of European history lasting from 1250 to 1500 AD. The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern era (and, in much of Europe, the Renaissance).\n\nAround 1300, centuries of prosperity and growth in Europe came to a halt. A series of famines and plagues, including the Great Famine of 1315–1317 and the Black Death, reduced the population to around half of what it was before the calamities. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. France and England experienced serious peasant uprisings, such as the Jacquerie and the Peasants' Revolt, as well as over a century of intermittent conflict, the Hundred Years' War. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was temporarily shattered by the Western Schism. Collectively, those events are sometimes called the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages.\n\nDespite the crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress in the arts and sciences. Following a renewed interest in ancient Greek and Roman texts that took root in the High Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance began. The absorption of Latin texts had started before the Renaissance of the 12th century through contact with Arabs during the Crusades, but the availability of important Greek texts accelerated with the Capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks, when many Byzantine scholars had to seek refuge in the West, particularly Italy.\n\nCombined with this influx of classical ideas was the invention of printing, which facilitated dissemination of the printed word and democratized learning. Those two things would later lead to the Protestant Reformation. Toward the end of the period, the Age of Discovery began. The expansion of the Ottoman Empire cut off trading possibilities with the East. Europeans were forced to seek new trading routes, leading to the Spanish expedition under Christopher Columbus to the Americas in 1492 and Vasco da Gama’s voyage to Africa and India in 1498. Their discoveries strengthened the economy and power of European nations.\n\nThe changes brought about by these developments have led many scholars to view this period as the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of modern history and of early modern Europe. However, the division is somewhat artificial, since ancient learning was never entirely absent from European society. As a result, there was developmental continuity between the ancient age (via classical antiquity) and the modern age. Some historians, particularly in Italy, prefer not to speak of the Late Middle Ages at all but rather see the high period of the Middle Ages transitioning to the Renaissance and the modern era.\n\nThe term \"Late Middle Ages\" refers to one of the three periods of the Middle Ages, along with the Early Middle Ages and the High Middle Ages. Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodization in his \"History of the Florentine People\" (1442). Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in \"Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire\" (1439–1453). Tripartite periodization became standard after the German historian Christoph Cellarius published \"Universal History Divided into an Ancient, Medieval, and New Period\" (1683).\n\nFor 18th-century historians studying the 14th and 15th centuries, the central theme was the Renaissance, with its rediscovery of ancient learning and the emergence of an individual spirit. The heart of this rediscovery lies in Italy, where, in the words of Jacob Burckhardt: \"Man became a spiritual individual and recognized himself as such\". This proposition was later challenged, and it was argued that the 12th century was a period of greater cultural achievement.\n\nAs economic and demographic methods were applied to the study of history, the trend was increasingly to see the late Middle Ages as a period of recession and crisis. Belgian historian Henri Pirenne continued the subdivision of Early, High, and Late Middle Ages in the years around World War I. Yet it was his Dutch colleague, Johan Huizinga, who was primarily responsible for popularising the pessimistic view of the Late Middle Ages, with his book \"The Autumn of the Middle Ages\" (1919). To Huizinga, whose research focused on France and the Low Countries rather than Italy, despair and decline were the main themes, not rebirth.\n\nModern historiography on the period has reached a consensus between the two extremes of innovation and crisis. It is now generally acknowledged that conditions were vastly different north and south of the Alps, and the term \"Late Middle Ages\" is often avoided entirely within Italian historiography. The term \"Renaissance\" is still considered useful for describing certain intellectual, cultural, or artistic developments, but not as the defining feature of an entire European historical epoch. The period from the early 14th century up until – and sometimes including – the 16th century, is rather seen as characterized by other trends: demographic and economic decline followed by recovery, the end of western religious unity and the subsequent emergence of the nation state, and the expansion of European influence onto the rest of the world.\n\nThe limits of Christian Europe were still being defined in the 14th and 15th centuries. While the Grand Duchy of Moscow was beginning to repel the Mongols, and the Iberian kingdoms completed the Reconquista of the peninsula and turned their attention outwards, the Balkans fell under the dominance of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, the remaining nations of the continent were locked in almost constant international or internal conflict.\n\nThe situation gradually led to the consolidation of central authority and the emergence of the nation state. The financial demands of war necessitated higher levels of taxation, resulting in the emergence of representative bodies – most notably the English Parliament. The growth of secular authority was further aided by the decline of the papacy with the Western Schism and the coming of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nAfter the failed union of Sweden and Norway of 1319–1365, the pan-Scandinavian Kalmar Union was instituted in 1397. The Swedes were reluctant members of the Danish-dominated union from the start. In an attempt to subdue the Swedes, King Christian II of Denmark had large numbers of the Swedish aristocracy killed in the Stockholm Bloodbath of 1520. Yet this measure only led to further hostilities, and Sweden broke away for good in 1523. Norway, on the other hand, became an inferior party of the union and remained united with Denmark until 1814.\n\nIceland benefited from its relative isolation and was the last Scandinavian country to be struck by the Black Death. Meanwhile, the Norse colony in Greenland died out, probably under extreme weather conditions in the 15th century. These conditions might have been the effect of the Little Ice Age.\n\nThe death of Alexander III of Scotland in 1286 threw the country into a succession crisis, and the English king, Edward I, was brought in to arbitrate. Edward claimed overlordship over Scotland, leading to the Wars of Scottish Independence. The English were eventually defeated, and the Scots were able to develop a stronger state under the Stuarts.\n\nFrom 1337, England's attention was largely directed towards France in the Hundred Years' War. Henry V’s victory at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 briefly paved the way for a unification of the two kingdoms, but his son Henry VI soon squandered all previous gains. The loss of France led to discontent at home. Soon after the end of the war in 1453, the dynastic struggles of the Wars of the Roses (c. 1455–1485) began, involving the rival dynasties of the House of Lancaster and House of York.\n\nThe war ended in the accession of Henry VII of the Tudor family, who continued the work started by the Yorkist kings of building a strong, centralized monarchy. While England's attention was thus directed elsewhere, the Hiberno-Norman lords in Ireland were becoming gradually more assimilated into Irish society, and the island was allowed to develop virtual independence under English overlordship.\n\nThe French House of Valois, which followed the House of Capet in 1328, was at its outset marginalized in its own country, first by the English invading forces of the Hundred Years' War, and later by the powerful Duchy of Burgundy. The emergence of Joan of Arc as a military leader changed the course of war in favour of the French, and the initiative was carried further by King Louis XI.\n\nMeanwhile, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, met resistance in his attempts to consolidate his possessions, particularly from the Swiss Confederation formed in 1291. When Charles was killed in the Burgundian Wars at the Battle of Nancy in 1477, the Duchy of Burgundy was reclaimed by France. At the same time, the County of Burgundy and the wealthy Burgundian Netherlands came into the Holy Roman Empire under Habsburg control, setting up conflict for centuries to come.\n\nBohemia prospered in the 14th century, and the Golden Bull of 1356 made the king of Bohemia first among the imperial electors, but the Hussite revolution threw the country into crisis. The Holy Roman Empire passed to the Habsburgs in 1438, where it remained until its dissolution in 1806. Yet in spite of the extensive territories held by the Habsburgs, the Empire itself remained fragmented, and much real power and influence lay with the individual principalities. In addition, financial institutions, such as the Hanseatic League and the Fugger family, held great power, on both economic and political levels.\n\nThe kingdom of Hungary experienced a golden age during the 14th century. In particular the reigns of the Angevin kings Charles Robert (1308–42) and his son Louis the Great (1342–82) were marked by success. The country grew wealthy as the main European supplier of gold and silver. Louis the Great led successful campaigns from Lithuania to Southern Italy, and from Poland to Northern Greece.\n\nHe had the greatest military potential of the 14th century with his enormous armies (often over 100,000 men). Meanwhile, Poland's attention was turned eastwards, as the union with Lithuania created an enormous entity in the region. The union, and the conversion of Lithuania, also marked the end of paganism in Europe.\n\nLouis did not leave a son as heir after his death in 1382. Instead, he named as his heir the young prince Sigismund of Luxemburg. The Hungarian nobility did not accept his claim, and the result was an internal war. Sigismund eventually achieved total control of Hungary and established his court in Buda and Visegrád. Both palaces were rebuilt and improved, and were considered the richest of the time in Europe. Inheriting the throne of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire, Sigismund continued conducting his politics from Hungary, but he was kept busy fighting the Hussites and the Ottoman Empire, which was becoming a menace to Europe in the beginning of the 15th century.\n\nThe King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary led the largest army of mercenaries of the time, The Black Army of Hungary, which he used to conquer Bohemia and Austria and to fight the Ottoman Empire. However, the glory of the Kingdom ended in the early 16th century, when the King Louis II of Hungary was killed in the battle of Mohács in 1526 against the Ottoman Empire. Hungary then fell into a serious crisis and was invaded, ending its significance in central Europe during the medieval era.\n\nThe state of Kievan Rus' fell during the 13th century in the Mongol invasion. The Grand Duchy of Moscow rose in power thereafter, winning a great victory against the Golden Horde at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. The victory did not end Tartar rule in the region, however, and its immediate beneficiary was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which extended its influence eastwards.\n\nUnder the reign of Ivan the Great (1462–1505), Moscow became a major regional power, and the annexation of the vast Republic of Novgorod in 1478 laid the foundations for a Russian national state. After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 the Russian princes started to see themselves as the heirs of the Byzantine Empire. They eventually took on the imperial title of Tsar, and Moscow was described as the Third Rome.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire had for a long time dominated the eastern Mediterranean in politics and culture. By the 14th century, however, it had almost entirely collapsed into a tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, centered on the city of Constantinople and a few enclaves in Greece. With the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was permanently extinguished.\n\nThe Bulgarian Empire was in decline by the 14th century, and the ascendancy of Serbia was marked by the Serbian victory over the Bulgarians in the Battle of Velbazhd in 1330. By 1346, the Serbian king Stefan Dušan had been proclaimed emperor. Yet Serbian dominance was short-lived; the Serbian army led by the Lazar Hrebljevanovic was defeated by the Ottomans at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, where most of the Serbian nobility was killed and the south of the country came under Ottoman occupation, as much of southern Bulgaria had become Ottoman territory in 1371. Northern remnants of Bulgaria were finally conquered by 1396, Serbia fell in 1459, Bosnia in 1463, and Albania was finally subordinated in 1479 only a few years after the death of Skanderbeg. Belgrade, an Hungarian domain at the time, was the last large Balkan city to fall under Ottoman rule, in 1521. By the end of the medieval period, the entire Balkan peninsula was annexed by, or became vassal to, the Ottomans.\n\nAvignon was the seat of the papacy from 1309 to 1376. With the return of the Pope to Rome in 1378, the Papal State developed into a major secular power, culminating in the morally corrupt papacy of Alexander VI. Florence grew to prominence amongst the Italian city-states through financial business, and the dominant Medici family became important promoters of the Renaissance through their patronage of the arts. Other city states in northern Italy also expanded their territories and consolidated their power, primarily Milan and Venice. The War of the Sicilian Vespers had by the early 14th century divided southern Italy into an Aragon Kingdom of Sicily and an Anjou Kingdom of Naples. In 1442, the two kingdoms were effectively united under Aragonese control.\n\nThe 1469 marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon and the 1479 death of John II of Aragon led to the creation of modern-day Spain. In 1492, Granada was captured from the Moors, thereby completing the Reconquista. Portugal had during the 15th century – particularly under Henry the Navigator – gradually explored the coast of Africa, and in 1498, Vasco da Gama found the sea route to India. The Spanish monarchs met the Portuguese challenge by financing the expedition of Christopher Columbus to find a western sea route to India, leading to the discovery of the Americas in 1492.\n\nAround 1300–1350 the Medieval Warm Period gave way to the Little Ice Age. The colder climate resulted in agricultural crises, the first of which is known as the Great Famine of 1315-1317. The demographic consequences of this famine, however, were not as severe as the plagues that occurred later in the century, particularly the Black Death. Estimates of the death rate caused by this epidemic range from one third to as much as sixty percent. By around 1420, the accumulated effect of recurring plagues and famines had reduced the population of Europe to perhaps no more than a third of what it was a century earlier. The effects of natural disasters were exacerbated by armed conflicts; this was particularly the case in France during the Hundred Years' War. It took 150 years for the European population to regain similar levels of 1300.\n\nAs the European population was severely reduced, land became more plentiful for the survivors, and labour consequently more expensive. Attempts by landowners to forcibly reduce wages, such as the English 1351 Statute of Laborers, were doomed to fail. These efforts resulted in nothing more than fostering resentment among the peasantry, leading to rebellions such as the French Jacquerie in 1358 and the English Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The long-term effect was the virtual end of serfdom in Western Europe. In Eastern Europe, on the other hand, landowners were able to exploit the situation to force the peasantry into even more repressive bondage.\n\nThe upheavals caused by the Black Death left certain minority groups particularly vulnerable, especially the Jews, who were often blamed for the calamities. Anti-Jewish pogroms were carried out all over Europe; in February 1349, 2,000 Jews were murdered in Strasbourg. States were also guilty of discrimination against the Jews. Monarchs gave in to the demands of the people, and the Jews were expelled from England in 1290, from France in 1306, from Spain in 1492, and from Portugal in 1497.\n\nWhile the Jews were suffering persecution, one group that probably experienced increased empowerment in the Late Middle Ages was women. The great social changes of the period opened up new possibilities for women in the fields of commerce, learning and religion. Yet at the same time, women were also vulnerable to incrimination and persecution, as belief in witchcraft increased.\n\nUp until the mid-14th century, Europe had experienced steadily increasing urbanisation. Cities were also decimated by the Black Death, but the role of urban areas as centres of learning, commerce and government ensured continued growth. By 1500, Venice, Milan, Naples, Paris and Constantinople each probably had more than 100,000 inhabitants. Twenty-two other cities were larger than 40,000; most of these were in Italy and the Iberian peninsula, but there were also some in France, the Empire, the Low Countries, plus London in England.\n\nThrough battles such as Courtrai (1302), Bannockburn (1314), and Morgarten (1315), it became clear to the great territorial princes of Europe that the military advantage of the feudal cavalry was lost, and that a well equipped infantry was preferable. Through the Welsh Wars the English became acquainted with, and adopted, the highly efficient longbow. Once properly managed, this weapon gave them a great advantage over the French in the Hundred Years' War.\n\nThe introduction of gunpowder affected the conduct of war significantly. Though employed by the English as early as the Battle of Crécy in 1346, firearms initially had little effect in the field of battle. It was through the use of cannons as siege weapons that major change was brought about; the new methods would eventually change the architectural structure of fortifications.\n\nChanges also took place within the recruitment and composition of armies. The use of the national or feudal levy was gradually replaced by paid troops of domestic retinues or foreign mercenaries. The practice was associated with Edward III of England and the condottieri of the Italian city-states. All over Europe, Swiss soldiers were in particularly high demand. At the same time, the period also saw the emergence of the first permanent armies. It was in Valois France, under the heavy demands of the Hundred Years' War, that the armed forces gradually assumed a permanent nature.\n\nParallel to the military developments emerged also a constantly more elaborate chivalric code of conduct for the warrior class. This new-found ethos can be seen as a response to the diminishing military role of the aristocracy, and gradually it became almost entirely detached from its military origin. The spirit of chivalry was given expression through the new (secular) type of chivalric orders; the first of these was the Order of St. George, founded by Charles I of Hungary in 1325, while the best known was probably the English Order of the Garter, founded by Edward III in 1348.\n\nThe French crown's increasing dominance over the Papacy culminated in the transference of the Holy See to Avignon in 1309. When the Pope returned to Rome in 1377, this led to the election of different popes in Avignon and Rome, resulting in the Papal Schism (1378–1417). The Schism divided Europe along political lines; while France, her ally Scotland and the Spanish kingdoms supported the Avignon Papacy, France's enemy England stood behind the Pope in Rome, together with Portugal, Scandinavia and most of the German princes.\n\nAt the Council of Constance (1414–1418), the Papacy was once more united in Rome. Even though the unity of the Western Church was to last for another hundred years, and though the Papacy was to experience greater material prosperity than ever before, the Great Schism had done irreparable damage. The internal struggles within the Church had impaired her claim to universal rule, and promoted anti-clericalism among the people and their rulers, paving the way for reform movements.\n\nThough many of the events were outside the traditional time period of the Middle Ages, the end of the unity of the Western Church (the Protestant Reformation), was one of the distinguishing characteristics of the medieval period. The Catholic Church had long fought against heretic movements, but during the Late Middle Ages, it started to experience demands for reform from within. The first of these came from Oxford professor John Wycliffe in England. Wycliffe held that the Bible should be the only authority in religious questions, and he spoke out against transubstantiation, celibacy and indulgences. In spite of influential supporters among the English aristocracy, such as John of Gaunt, the movement was not allowed to survive. Though Wycliffe himself was left unmolested, his supporters, the Lollards, were eventually suppressed in England.\n\nThe marriage of Richard II of England to Anne of Bohemia established contacts between the two nations and brought Lollard ideas to her homeland. The teachings of the Czech priest Jan Hus were based on those of John Wycliffe, yet his followers, the Hussites, were to have a much greater political impact than the Lollards. Hus gained a great following in Bohemia, and in 1414, he was requested to appear at the Council of Constance to defend his cause. When he was burned as a heretic in 1415, it caused a popular uprising in the Czech lands. The subsequent Hussite Wars fell apart due to internal quarrels and did not result in religious or national independence for the Czechs, but both the Catholic Church and the German element within the country were weakened.\n\nMartin Luther, a German monk, started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of Wittenberg on October 31, 1517. The immediate provocation spurring this act was Pope Leo X’s renewal of the indulgence for the building of the new St. Peter's Basilica in 1514. Luther was challenged to recant his heresy at the Diet of Worms in 1521. When he refused, he was placed under the ban of the Empire by Charles V. Receiving the protection of Frederick the Wise, he was then able to translate the Bible into German.\n\nTo many secular rulers the Protestant reformation was a welcome opportunity to expand their wealth and influence. The Catholic Church met the challenges of the reforming movements with what has been called the Catholic Reformation, or Counter-Reformation. Europe became split into northern Protestant and southern Catholic parts, resulting in the Religious Wars of the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nThe increasingly dominant position of the Ottoman Empire in the eastern Mediterranean presented an impediment to trade for the Christian nations of the west, who in turn started looking for alternatives. Portuguese and Spanish explorers found new trade routes – south of Africa to India, and across the Atlantic Ocean to America. As Genoese and Venetian merchants opened up direct sea routes with Flanders, the Champagne fairs lost much of their importance.\n\nAt the same time, English wool export shifted from raw wool to processed cloth, resulting in losses for the cloth manufacturers of the Low Countries. In the Baltic and North Sea, the Hanseatic League reached the peak of their power in the 14th century, but started going into decline in the fifteenth.\n\nIn the late 13th and early 14th centuries, a process took place – primarily in Italy but partly also in the Empire – that historians have termed a 'commercial revolution'. Among the innovations of the period were new forms of partnership and the issuing of insurance, both of which contributed to reducing the risk of commercial ventures; the bill of exchange and other forms of credit that circumvented the canonical laws for gentiles against usury, and eliminated the dangers of carrying bullion; and new forms of accounting, in particular double-entry bookkeeping, which allowed for better oversight and accuracy.\n\nWith the financial expansion, trading rights became more jealously guarded by the commercial elite. Towns saw the growing power of guilds, while on a national level special companies would be granted monopolies on particular trades, like the English wool Staple. The beneficiaries of these developments would accumulate immense wealth. Families like the Fuggers in Germany, the Medicis in Italy, the de la Poles in England, and individuals like Jacques Coeur in France would help finance the wars of kings, and achieve great political influence in the process.\n\nThough there is no doubt that the demographic crisis of the 14th century caused a dramatic fall in production and commerce in \"absolute\" terms, there has been a vigorous historical debate over whether the decline was greater than the fall in population. While the older orthodoxy held that the artistic output of the Renaissance was a result of greater opulence, more recent studies have suggested that there might have been a so-called 'depression of the Renaissance'. In spite of convincing arguments for the case, the statistical evidence is simply too incomplete for a definite conclusion to be made.\n\nIn the 14th century, the predominant academic trend of scholasticism was challenged by the humanist movement. Though primarily an attempt to revitalise the classical languages, the movement also led to innovations within the fields of science, art and literature, helped on by impulses from Byzantine scholars who had to seek refuge in the west after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.\n\nIn science, classical authorities like Aristotle were challenged for the first time since antiquity. Within the arts, humanism took the form of the Renaissance. Though the 15th-century Renaissance was a highly localised phenomenon – limited mostly to the city states of northern Italy – artistic developments were taking place also further north, particularly in the Netherlands.\n\nThe predominant school of thought in the 13th century was the Thomistic reconciliation of the teachings of Aristotle with Christian theology. The Condemnation of 1277, enacted at the University of Paris, placed restrictions on ideas that could be interpreted as heretical; restrictions that had implication for Aristotelian thought. An alternative was presented by William of Ockham, following the manner of the earlier Franciscan John Duns Scotus, who insisted that the world of reason and the world of faith had to be kept apart. Ockham introduced the principle of parsimony – or Occam's razor – whereby a simple theory is preferred to a more complex one, and speculation on unobservable phenomena is avoided. This maxim is, however, often misquoted. Occam was referring to his nominalism in this quotation. Essentially saying the theory of absolutes, or metaphysical realism, was unnecessary to make sense of the world.\n\nThis new approach liberated scientific speculation from the dogmatic restraints of Aristotelian science, and paved the way for new approaches. Particularly within the field of theories of motion great advances were made, when such scholars as Jean Buridan, Nicole Oresme and the Oxford Calculators challenged the work of Aristotle. Buridan developed the theory of \"impetus\" as the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was an important step towards the modern concept of inertia. The works of these scholars anticipated the heliocentric worldview of Nicolaus Copernicus.\n\nCertain technological inventions of the period – whether of Arab or Chinese origin, or unique European innovations – were to have great influence on political and social developments, in particular gunpowder, the printing press and the compass. The introduction of gunpowder to the field of battle affected not only military organisation, but helped advance the nation state. Gutenberg's movable type printing press made possible not only the Reformation, but also a dissemination of knowledge that would lead to a gradually more egalitarian society. The compass, along with other innovations such as the cross-staff, the mariner's astrolabe, and advances in shipbuilding, enabled the navigation of the World Oceans, and the early phases of colonialism. Other inventions had a greater impact on everyday life, such as eyeglasses and the weight-driven clock.\n\nA precursor to Renaissance art can be seen already in the early 14th-century works of Giotto. Giotto was the first painter since antiquity to attempt the representation of a three-dimensional reality, and to endow his characters with true human emotions. The most important developments, however, came in 15th-century Florence. The affluence of the merchant class allowed extensive patronage of the arts, and foremost among the patrons were the Medici.\n\nThe period saw several important technical innovations, like the principle of linear perspective found in the work of Masaccio, and later described by Brunelleschi. Greater realism was also achieved through the scientific study of anatomy, championed by artists like Donatello. This can be seen particularly well in his sculptures, inspired by the study of classical models. As the centre of the movement shifted to Rome, the period culminated in the High Renaissance masters da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael.\n\nThe ideas of the Italian Renaissance were slow to cross the Alps into northern Europe, but important artistic innovations were made also in the Low Countries. Though not – as previously believed – the inventor of oil painting, Jan van Eyck was a champion of the new medium, and used it to create works of great realism and minute detail. The two cultures influenced each other and learned from each other, but painting in the Netherlands remained more focused on textures and surfaces than the idealized compositions of Italy.\n\nIn northern European countries Gothic architecture remained the norm, and the gothic cathedral was further elaborated. In Italy, on the other hand, architecture took a different direction, also here inspired by classical ideals. The crowning work of the period was the Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, with Giotto's clock tower, Ghiberti's baptistery gates, and Brunelleschi's cathedral dome of unprecedented proportions.\n\nThe most important development of late medieval literature was the ascendancy of the vernacular languages. The vernacular had been in use in England since the 8th century and France since the 11th century, where the most popular genres had been the chanson de geste, troubadour lyrics and romantic epics, or the romance. Though Italy was later in evolving a native literature in the vernacular language, it was here that the most important developments of the period were to come.\n\nDante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy\", written in the early 14th century, merged a medieval world view with classical ideals. Another promoter of the Italian language was Boccaccio with his \"Decameron\". The application of the vernacular did not entail a rejection of Latin, and both Dante and Boccaccio wrote prolifically in Latin as well as Italian, as would Petrarch later (whose \"Canzoniere\" also promoted the vernacular and whose contents are considered the first modern lyric poems). Together the three poets established the Tuscan dialect as the norm for the modern Italian language.\n\nThe new literary style spread rapidly, and in France influenced such writers as Eustache Deschamps and Guillaume de Machaut. In England Geoffrey Chaucer helped establish Middle English as a literary language with his \"Canterbury Tales\", which contained a wide variety of narrators and stories (including some translated from Boccaccio). The spread of vernacular literature eventually reached as far as Bohemia, and the Baltic, Slavic and Byzantine worlds.\n\nMusic was an important part of both secular and spiritual culture, and in the universities it made up part of the \"quadrivium\" of the liberal arts. From the early 13th century, the dominant sacred musical form had been the motet; a composition with text in several parts. From the 1330s and onwards, emerged the polyphonic style, which was a more complex fusion of independent voices. Polyphony had been common in the secular music of the Provençal troubadours. Many of these had fallen victim to the 13th-century Albigensian Crusade, but their influence reached the papal court at Avignon.\n\nThe main representatives of the new style, often referred to as \"ars nova\" as opposed to the \"ars antiqua\", were the composers Philippe de Vitry and Guillaume de Machaut. In Italy, where the Provençal troubadours had also found refuge, the corresponding period goes under the name of trecento, and the leading composers were Giovanni da Cascia, Jacopo da Bologna and Francesco Landini. Prominent reformer of Orthodox Church music from the first half of 14th century was John Kukuzelis; he also introduced a system of notation widely used in the Balkans in the following centuries.\n\nIn the British Isles, plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular Mystery plays were written in cycles of a large number of plays: York (48 plays), Chester (24), Wakefield (32) and Unknown (42). A larger number of plays survive from France and Germany in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the Late Middle Ages. Many of these plays contained comedy, devils, villains and clowns.\n\nMorality plays emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550. The most interesting morality play is \"The Castle of Perseverance\" which depicts mankind's progress from birth to death. However, the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is \"Everyman\". Everyman receives Death's summons, struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity. Along the way, he is deserted by Kindred, Goods, and Fellowship – only Good Deeds goes with him to the grave.\n\nAt the end of the Late Middle Ages, professional actors began to appear in England and Europe. Richard III and Henry VII both maintained small companies of professional actors. Their plays were performed in the Great Hall of a nobleman's residence, often with a raised platform at one end for the audience and a \"screen\" at the other for the actors. Also important were Mummers' plays, performed during the Christmas season, and court masques. These masques were especially popular during the reign of Henry VIII who had a House of Revels built and an Office of Revels established in 1545.\n\nThe end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors, including the weakening power of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation and the banning of religious plays in many countries. Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the Netherlands in 1539, the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama. It also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in Greek and Roman theatre provided them with the perfect opportunity.\n\nAfter the end of the late Middle Ages period, the Renaissance spread unevenly over continental Europe from the southern European region. The intellectual transformation of the Renaissance is viewed as a bridge between the Middle Ages and the Modern era. Europeans would later begin an era of world discovery. Combined with the influx of classical ideas was the invention of printing which facilitated dissemination of the printed word and democratized learning. These two things would lead to the Protestant Reformation. Europeans also discovered new trading routes, as was the case with Columbus’ travel to the Americas in 1492, and Vasco da Gama’s circumnavigation of Africa and India in 1498. Their discoveries strengthened the economy and power of European nations.\n\nBy the end of the 15th century the Ottoman Empire had advanced all over Southeastern Europe, eventually conquering the Byzantine Empire and extending control over the Balkan states. Hungary was the last bastion of the Latin Christian world in the East, and fought to keep its rule over a period of two centuries. After the tragic death of the young king Vladislaus I of Hungary during the Battle of Varna in 1444 against the Ottomans, the Kingdom was placed in the hands of count John Hunyadi, who became Hungary's regent-governor (1446–1453). Hunyadi was considered one of the most relevant military figures of the 15th century: Pope Pius II awarded him the title of \"Athleta Christi\" or Champion of Christ for being the only hope of resisting the Ottomans from advancing to Central and Western Europe.\n\nHunyadi succeeded during the Siege of Belgrade in 1456 against the Ottomans, the biggest victory against that empire in decades. This battle became a real Crusade against the Muslims, as the peasants were motivated by the Franciscan monk Saint John of Capistrano, who came from Italy predicating Holy War. The effect that it created in that time was one of the main factors that helped in achieving the victory. However the premature death of the Hungarian Lord left Pannonia defenseless and in chaos. In an extremely unusual event for the Middle Ages, Hunyadi's son, Matthias, was elected as King of Hungary by the nobility. For the first time, a member of an aristocratic family (and not from a royal family) was crowned.\n\nKing Matthias Corvinus of Hungary (1458–1490) was one of the most prominent figures of the period, directing campaigns to the West, conquering Bohemia in answer to the Pope's call for help against the Hussite Protestants. Also, in resolving political hostilities with the German emperor Frederick III of Habsburg, he invaded his western domains. Matthew organized the Black Army of mercenary soldiers; it was considered as the biggest army of its time. Using this powerful tool, the Hungarian king led wars against the Turkish armies and stopped the Ottomans during his reign. After the death of Matthew, and with end of the Black Army, the Ottoman Empire grew in strength and Central Europe was defenseless. At the Battle of Mohács, the forces of the Ottoman Empire annihilated the Hungarian army and Louis II of Hungary drowned in the Csele Creek while trying to escape. The leader of the Hungarian army, Pál Tomori, also died in the battle. This is considered to be one of the final battles of Medieval times.\n\n\"Dates are approximate, consult particular articles for details\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was opened in 1968 by Trinidadian community activist and civil rights campaigner Frank Crichlow. Like the El Rio before it — a coffee bar run by Crichlow at 127 Westbourne Park Road in the early 1960s that attracted attention in the Profumo affair, as one of the places frequented by Christine Keeler and Stephen Ward — the Mangrove was a meeting place for the black community in the area, as well as for white radicals, artists, authors, and musicians. Famous customers included Jimi Hendrix, Nina Simone, Bob Marley, C. L. R. James, Lionel Morrison, Norman Beaton, Vanessa Redgrave, Colin MacInnes, Richard Neville and Tony Gifford. A small newspaper, \"The Hustler\", was published on the premises, underlining the community aspect of the restaurant, which also served as an informal head office for the Notting Hill Carnival.\n\nIn 1969 the Mangrove restaurant became the target of police attention that seemed designed to close it down. Robin Bunce and Paul Field write in \"The Independent\" that it was raided 12 times between January 1969 and July 1970, and in August that year a protest march was organized demanding \"hands off the Mangrove\". The protest ended in violence and the arrests of nine protesters (the \"Mangrove Nine\"), including Crichlow, Althea Jones Lecointe and Darcus Howe, on charges that included conspiracy to incite a riot. Their celebrated trial in 1971 — which featured an unsuccessful demand by Howe for an all-black jury — ended with the acquittal of all nine on the incitement charges, and five of the nine, including Crichlow and Howe, on all charges. Bunce and Field write that the Mangrove Nine \"turned the fight against police racism into a cause célèbre.\" \n\nA documentary film, \"The Mangrove Nine\" (directed by Franco Rosso, produced by Rosso and John La Rose, with Horace Ové as associate producer, and scripted by La Rose), was made in 1973, and includes interviews with the defendants recorded before the final verdicts.\n\nRapid gentrification of the restaurant's neighbourhood in the 1980s once more led to increased police pressure. The restaurant was raided twice in 1988, once by 48 police officers in riot gear, and Crichlow was charged with supplying heroin and cannabis, despite being known locally for his strong anti-drug stance. Crichlow, who was prohibited from going near the restaurant for a year, alleged that the police themselves had planted the drugs. He was acquitted of all charges after the year was over, and in 1992 the Metropolitan Police paid him damages of £50,000 for false imprisonment, battery and malicious prosecution. But both his year-long absence and changes in economic conditions had caused the restaurant to fail. By 1992, it was closed, and the premises boarded up. The Rum Kitchen, one of a chain of Caribbean-themed restaurants, now operates from the Mangrove's former address, outside which a heritage blue plaque to honour Frank Crichlow was unveiled on 4 December 2011 by Jak Beula's Nubian Jak Community Trust.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7986289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7986289", "title": "Mary Anne Everett Green", "text": "Mary Anne Everett Green\n\nMary Anne Everett Green, \"née\" Wood (19 July 1818 – 1 November 1895) was an English historian. After establishing a reputation for scholarship with two multi-volume books on royal ladies and noblewomen, she was invited to assist in preparing calendars (abstracts) of hitherto disorganised historical state papers. In this role of \"calendars editor\", she participated in the mid-19th-century initiative to establish a centralised national archive. She was one of the most respected female historians in Victorian Britain.\n\nMary Anne Everett Wood was born in Sheffield to a Wesleyan Methodist minister, Robert Wood, and his wife Sarah. Her father was responsible for her education, offering an extensive knowledge of history and languages, and she benefited from mixing with her parents' intellectual friends including James Everett, the minister and writer, after whom she was named.\n\nWhen the family moved to London in 1841 she began researching in the British Museum and elsewhere, and during the 1840s she worked on \"Letters of Royal and Illustrious Ladies\" (1846) and \"Lives of the Princesses of England: from the Norman Conquest \" (1849–1855). She had started work on this book in 1843, using private libraries like that of the rich collector Sir Thomas Phillipps, as well as archives like those at Lambeth Palace. After her marriage to the painter George Pycock Green in 1845, they travelled for the sake of his artistic career, and she was able to research her subject further in Paris and Antwerp. \"Lives of the Princesses\" was praised by the antiquary Dawson Turner and by the historian Sir Francis Palgrave among others.\n\nPalgrave, the first Deputy Keeper of the Public Record Office (PRO), had met Green, was impressed with her scholarship, especially her knowledge of languages, and recommended her to his superior John Romilly, the Master of the Rolls. Romilly was continuing Lord Langdale's work of overseeing the establishment of a national archive (the PRO), and publishing some of the documents it held. Numerous state papers which had been assembled from different locations were studied and summarised, and then the abstracts were arranged in chronological order in the form of \"calendars\".\n\nIn 1854 Romilly invited Green to become an external calendars editor. In her first few years doing this work she gave birth to two of her three daughters, one of whom, Evelyn Everett-Green, became a novelist. Mary Anne Everett Green's son had been born in 1847 but died in 1876. Her husband became disabled and it was important for her to earn an income. While supplementing her work at the PRO with journalism, she pursued some private research but had no time to complete a planned book on the Hanoverian queens.\n\nUnlike the full-time employees doing similar work, such as Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, and the three male free-lancers working on the calendars, who all had paid assistance, Green's only helper was her sister Esther, but she became the \"most highly respected\" and \"most efficient compiler of calendars\". She sometimes complained about being paid less than the men, and also disputed editorial questions with her superiors. Romilly did eventually agree to her suggestion of historical prefaces written by herself and the other editors, and these came to be seen as an essential part of the calendars. Green herself wrote 700 pages of prefaces which amount to a history of seventeenth-century England.\n\nOver the next four decades Green edited 41 volumes starting with \"Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, of the Reign of James I\" (4 volumes, 1857–9). By the time she completed \"Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, of the Reign of Elizabeth\" in 1872, reviewers considered she had established a model for such work; with more detailed abstracts than many other calendars, as well as the highest standards of scholarship, her work \"came to be recognized as the standard to be followed by all editors\".\n\nLike other 19th-century women historians, Green tended to concentrate her work in fields seen as suited to \"feminine\" talents: research into queens and ladies, private lives, and the deciphering, translation and compilation of historical documents, for instance. One of her earliest books was prefaced by her asking the reader not to criticise her for having \"ventured upon a field usually occupied only by the learned of the opposite sex.\" Her calendar prefaces, though, were an opportunity to write on broader, more \"masculine\" themes, like the Interregnum, earning respect for the overall quality and \"strict historical accuracy\".\n\nShe was one of only three women to sign a public petition in 1851 asking the PRO to offer free access to its records for serious scholars, a request which was granted in 1852. Alongside 80 men's signatures, including those of Charles Dickens, Macaulay, and Carlyle, were the women historians who depended on detailed study of freshly discovered original sources to claim authority for their work: Agnes Strickland and Lucy Aikin were the other two.\n\nGreen went on working at the PRO until shortly before she died, aged 77, at home in London on 1 November 1895, having passed her research on the Hanoverian queens to her friend A. W. Ward. Her work at the PRO was continued by the niece she had trained: Sophia Crawford Lomas. Both Ward and Lomas helped ensure that her \"Elizabeth, Electress Palatine and Queen of Bohemia\" (1909) appeared posthumously. Other books of hers include \"Diary of John Rous\" (1856) and \"Letters of Queen Henrietta Maria\" (1857). She was also known for her philanthropy.\n\n\n"}

The operation was launched on 15 June 2014 in North Waziristan along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border as a renewed effort against militancy in the wake of the 8 June attack on Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, for which the TTP and the IMU claimed responsibility. As of 14 July 2014, the operation internally displaced about 929,859 people belonging to 80,302 families from North Waziristan.\n\nPart of the war in North-West Pakistan, up to 30,000 Pakistani soldiers were involved in Zarb-e-Azb, described as a \"comprehensive operation\" to flush out all foreign and local militants hiding in North Waziristan. The operation has received widespread support from the Pakistani political, defence and civilian sectors. As a consequence, the overall security situation improved and terrorist attacks in Pakistan dropped to a six-year low since 2008. Zarb-e-Azb was followed by Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad which began in February 2017, following a resurgence in terrorist incidents.\n\n\"Zarb-e-Azb\" ( ) means \"sharp and cutting strike\". \"Azb\" also refers to the sword owned by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, which he used in the battles of Badr and Uhud.\n\nFor the first time, the Pakistani military implemented a military strategy called \"Seek, Destroy, Clear, Hold.\" The Pakistani military will seek the target. Once found, it will be destroyed. When destroyed, the infrastructure, bodies and weapons will be cleared and the area will be held both during this time and after its completion to ensure post-operation security and infrastructure rebuilding and/or area rehabilitation. The Seek and Destroy component is from the Vietnam War whereas the Clear and hold component is from the Iraq War. The Pakistani military combined the two doctrines as a single doctrine for the operation to be successful.\n\nPeace negotiations with the Taliban were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his election, although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed. The first session of talks, between committees appointed by the Pakistani Government and the Taliban, was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. The Taliban did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban religious figures to present their views. The terrorists called for the implementation of Sharia in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities, insisting that talks be held within the framework of the Pakistani constitution. A month-long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014.\n\nBesides the meetings at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, negotiations also involved helicopter travel by government representatives to the areas under militant control near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The government had indicated that stronger military action would be implemented if the talks failed.\n\nNegotiations collapsed after the execution of 23 Pakistani Frontier Corps soldiers by the Taliban on 17 February 2014. The soldiers had been held by the insurgents since 2010, and on 17 April 2014 the TTP formally ended the ceasefire.\nTaliban infighting since March 2014 killed more than 90 militants. The strife, triggered by differences between the Mehsud group (led by Sheheryar Mehsud) and another TTP faction (led by Khan Said Sajna), impeded the negotiations. The negotiations were irreversibly damaged by a terrorist attack on Karachi Airport for which the Taliban claimed responsibility and which killed 28 people (including security personnel). A Pakistani military official was quoted to have said, \"The army is ready for an operation.\"\n\nThe operation began one week after a terrorist attack on Pakistan's busiest airport. On 8 June 2014, 10 militants from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and TTP attacked Jinnah International Airport, Karachi, killing 28 people including security personnel and wounding at least 18.\n\nIn retaliation, the Pakistani military launched a series of air-strikes targeting terrorist hideouts in the areas bordering Afghanistan. At least 25 militants were killed on 10 June. The figure also included foreign militants killed. Two drone attacks on 12 June killed Uzbek, Afghan and local militants. On 15 June the Pakistani military intensified air-strikes and bombed eight foreign militant hideouts, killing as many as 140 militants (most Uzbek, including persons linked to the airport attack and airport attack commander and mastermind Abu Abdur Rehman Almani) in North Waziristan.\n\nThe Pakistani military had prepared for the operation long before, and the government prepared for a three-front operation: isolating targeted militant groups, obtaining support from the political parties and saving civilians from the backlash of the operation.\n\nDefence Minister Khawaja Asif said that the nation stood by its military: \"The decision was taken after the strategy of dialogue failed. The operation will continue until it reaches its logical conclusion. Any group that challenges Pakistan's constitution, attacks civilians, soldiers, and government installations and uses Pakistani territory to plan terrorist attacks will be targeted\". Asif added that internally displaced persons would be assisted by the federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments: \"We will try to ensure that the displaced do not have to stay away from their homes for too long.\"\nThe combat troops encircled militant bases in the towns of Mirali and Miranshah. Pakistani officials said that the Afghan's National Security Forces (ANSF) were requested to seal the border on their side so that militants do not escape. The operation involved the Air Force, Navy artillery, tanks and ground troops. According to a military statement, \"On the directions of the government, armed forces of Pakistan have launched a comprehensive operation against foreign and local terrorists who are hiding in sanctuaries in North Waziristan.\" An official with the military said that between 14,000 and 20,000 soldiers were normally stationed in North Waziristan before the operation, and he expected the offensive to require no more than a total of 30,000 troops.\n\n \n\nOn the 3rd of April, the Pakistani government declared victory and the end of the operation after clearing 640 square kilometers in Shawal, killing some 250 terrorists.\n\nPakistan clears last militant stronghold North Waziristan Agency\n\nPakistan Army major was killed and six soldiers injured in a roadside IED explosion in South Waziristan Agency\n\n\nDrone strikes, which were halted for six months at the request of the Pakistani government, resumed for the operation. The following drone strikes took place during the operation:\n\n\n\nOn 13 June 2015, the Pakistani military reported progress in the operation in the course of a year. DG ISPR Asim Saleem Bajwa reported that 2,763 militants had been killed so far, including 218 terrorist commanders in 9,000 intelligence based operations (IBOs). \"Some 837 hideouts of terrorists have been destroyed and 253 tonnes of explosives recovered so far during the operation\", he said. The Army also recovered 18,087 weapons, including heavy machine guns, light machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and AK-47s . Bajwa said that thousands of terrorists were also arrested, their strongholds cleared and their communication infrastructure destroyed. \"347 officers and soldiers of Pakistan Armed Forces have embraced martyrdom\", he added. The year 2015 was declared to be \"a year of victory\" and the operation itself a \"manifestation of the resolve to root out terrorism in the country\" by the Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif.\n\nOne and a half years after the start of Zarb-e-Azb, phenomenal successes were achieved, with the last pockets close to the Pakistan-Afghan border being cleared. Terrorist backbone broken and structure dismantled. Nexus with sleeper cells largely disrupted. Intelligence based Operations (IBOs) busted remaining sleeper cells. 3,400 terrorists were killed, with 837 hideouts from where they were carrying out terrorist activities destroyed. During the last 18 months over 13,200 IBOs carried out across the country in which 183 terrorists were killed, 2,193 arrested. IBOs continue. 488 officers and men of Pakistan Army, Frontier Corps KPK, Baluchistan, Rangers Sindh were killed and 1,914 injured in Operation Zarb-e-Azb. Total 11 military courts. 142 cases referred to military courts. 55 cases decided, 87 cases in process. 31 terrorists convicted. In July, the Pakistan Army Chief, General Raheel Sharif visited the military's forward-most positions near the Afghan border in North Waziristan He was briefed about the progress and future plans for Operation Zarb-e-Azb. Sharif also visited South Waziristan and Wana agencies. It was reported that the Pakistani military had just completed the preliminary preparations for final phase. In the area around Shawal, peaks were cleared.\n\nAs a result of the operation, 929,859 displaced civilians (from 80,302 families) were registered by Pakistani authorities as of 14 July. Financial support, relief goods and food packages were being distributed and 59 donation points were established across Pakistan by the army.\n\nOn 10 July, the Foreign Office of Pakistan said that the rehabilitation of internally displaced persons was an internal matter and reiterated that Pakistan had not requested international assistance. \"We have very clear instructions from the prime minister [to not seek external assistance], Pakistan has neither made nor intends to make a request for international assistance. It has been made very clear that all expenditure related to temporarily displaced Pakistanis will be met from our own resources\", Pakistani Foreign Office spokesperson Tasnim Aslam said. However, it was reported that the United States allocated $31 million for IDPs and an additional $9.3 million for health, hygiene, water and sanitation for IDPs and livestock. It was also reported that the United Arab Emirates government allocated $20.5 million in IDP humanitarian aid.\nIn February 2014, the Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq Dar told a visiting US Senator Jack Reed that the cost of the operation so far had reached and could go as high as .\n\nOn 8 December 2014, the military approved the phased repatriation of the IDPs. The Pakistani army chief said the early return of the IDPs was his top priority. According to senior military officials, civilian authorities were directed to plan the return of the IDPs to their homes in areas which have been cleared of terrorists. On 31 March 2015, the repatriation started. On the first day, 219 IDPs belonging to 62 families left Bannu for Spinwam and Shahmeri in North Waziristan. In the first phase till 24 April, about 1,200 families were to return to their homes in Sinwam, Shamiri, Mirali and Bubali areas of NWA. Each family was given as cash assistance and as transportation expenses at Mirzail. Food ration for six months and non-food items would also be given to each household. For effective disease control, children under five years of age were administered anti-polio vaccines and under 10 years of age were administered anti-measles vaccines. As of 4 May 2015, only 230 displaced families had returned since the launch of the repatriation programme. \"The civil administration can send entire displaced population back to their homes within a month if the area is de-notified as conflict zone,\" said an official dealing with IDPs repatriation. According to the official sources, the cut-off date for the return of IDPs was December 2016.\n\nThe decision by the Pakistani military to launch a comprehensive operation was widely supported, with journalists, opinion-makers, politicians and other social-media users commending the operation.\n\n - PTI chairman Imran Khan endorsed the military operation in North Waziristan as it became clear that the Taliban were not seriously negotiating. A week before, reiterating his party's stance on peace talks with militants, Imran said that an offensive in North Waziristan would unite militant forces against the Pakistani state. \"Conducting such a military operation when most of the groups in NWA want talks is suicidal,\" Imran said in a statement, adding that most groups in North Waziristan desired peace talks with the government. The PTI position changed as it became clear that negotiations were fruitless.\n\n - Jamat-e-Islami (JI), one of Pakistan's leading religious parties, continued to oppose any operation in North Waziristan. JI leader Siraj-ul-Haq urged the government to keep the option of negotiations with the Taliban. He warned that a military operation in North Waziristan would trigger a massive human tragedy, saying that it was the duty of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to consider the views of the nation and its leadership (inside and outside Parliament) before making a crucial decision affecting national security.\n\n - According to Muttahida Qaumi Movement senator Babar Khan Ghauri, \"This is a commendable decision by the government. We have been repeatedly telling the current government that instead of engaging the terrorists in dialogue, government should act against these elements. Karachi has a number of terrorists and it might suffer from a blow back; this should be tackled so Karachi does not have to suffer on account of this.\" MQM head Altaf Hussain said, \"I welcome this operation and I am glad that government is supporting the armed forces, those who have not backed the operation must realize that it is a matter of national security. I appeal to them to come on same page by setting aside their political compulsions.\" he said.\n\n - Awami National Party (ANP) member Zahid Khan said, \"We also held a dialogue previously (during our government) but that did not produce effective results. We wanted peace and we were okay if that came through dialogue but unfortunately that could not happen. This time, knowing from our experience, we had cautioned the government that [the] dialogue approach would not work. Government should have taken the parliament into confidence before launching the operation but it didn't.\"\n\nNorth Waziristan tribal elders assured their support for Operation Zarb-e-Azb, according to a statement released by ISPR director-general Major General Asim Bajwa. \"Many tribal elders from around Miranshah, Mir Ali, Datta Khel assure support to army operation,\" Bajwa tweeted. \"The tribesmen have assured the army that they would not let the militant to return to the area.\"\n\nOn 22 June 2014, more than 100 Islamic scholars issued a joint fatwa in support of the operation, calling it a jihad: \"Crushing of the attempts to disrupt peaceful atmosphere in a Muslim state is jihad\".\n\n\nOn 2 November 2014, a suicide bombing following the daily parade took place at Wagah border in Pakistan, more than 55 killed and over 200 injured. The attack was claimed by militant groups jamaat-ul-Ahrar and jundallah, sub-groups of TTP.\n\nOn 16 December 2014, seven gunmen belonging to the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) entered an Army Public School in Pakistani city of Peshawar and opened fire on school staff and children, killing 145 people consisting majority of students. The spokesperson of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, Mohammad Omar Khorasani, took the responsibility for the attack and said it was revenge for Operation Zarb-e-Azb.\n\nResponding to TTP's retaliatory attacks, Pakistan has mounted deadliest counter-retaliation on TTP; first removing the moratorium on executions of terrorists by the Presidential Order, and secondly establishing military courts commissions (roughly based on Gitmo). Pakistani authorities have issued \"hang till death\" orders to jail superintendents at the nationwide prisons. In weeks, a number of high-value detainees convicted on a terrorism charges were hanged.\n\nSince December 2014, Pakistan's intelligence community, law enforcement agencies, antiterrorism forces, and inter-provincial police have been engaged in deadly police encounters in all over the country. News media have been televising the live actions on tracking down the militants and targeting the TTP operatives in series of police encounters. In the afternoon of 20 December, the KP Police and the special agents of the FIA raided a safe house in Shabqadar, a town located in north of Peshawar. In an exchange of fire at the safe house, the KPK police and the other law enforcement agencies gunned down the six TTP fighters, including their commander and two other high-value targets who assisted in the attack. At the night of 20 December, the team of Pakistan Rangers personnel raided a safe house in Manghopir area of Karachi and killed five members of the TTP in a deadly shoot out.\n\nOn 22 December 2014, Karachi Police and the CID teams chased down and killed the TTP leader, Abid Muchar, along with his three associates in a police encounter. The same night, another action in took place in Karachi when the CID teams, in a high-speed chase in Hawke's Bay Beach, chased and apprehended five members of al-Qaeda's South Asian chapter who are suspected of planning an attack on a naval dockyard in Karachi in September.\n\nActing on a MI information, the navy's SSGN teams were inserted in secret hideout in Khyber Agency and stalked the six terrorists led by Saddam Jan— the mastermind of the Army Public School attack— at the midnight of 26 December 2014. In a late night operations, the SSGN combat teams reportedly hunted and killed Jan along with his six militants, while trying to seek sanctuary. An unnamed senior Pakistan government official confirmed the report.\n\nOn 9 January 2015, the CID teams gunned down the four al-Qaeda operatives after another high speed chase took place in Qayyumabad in Karachi. In another separate midnight action in Lahore, the teams of FIA's special agents, assisted by the Punjab Police, raided a house located in Burki Road. Lasting almost two-hour gun battle, the FIA teams hunted and gunned down Roohullah (alias: Asadullah)—the mastermind of the Wagah border attack along with three of his associates. Since the attack, the FIA had been on a hunt for Roohullah and was finally killed in a police encounter in Lahore.\n"}
{"id": "4224324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4224324", "title": "Origin of water on Earth", "text": "Origin of water on Earth\n\nThe origin of water on Earth, or the reason that there is clearly more liquid water on Earth than on the other rocky planets of the Solar System, is not completely understood. There exist numerous more or less mutually compatible hypotheses as to how water may have accumulated on Earth's surface over the past 4.5 billion years in sufficient quantity to form oceans.\n\nComets, trans-Neptunian objects, or water-rich meteoroids (protoplanets) from the outer reaches of the asteroid belt colliding with Earth may have brought water to the world's oceans. Asteroids may have been primarily responsible based on several studies, including measurements of the ratio of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and protium, since similar percentage impurities as in carbon-rich chondrites were found in oceanic water, whereas previous measurement of the isotopes' concentrations in comets and trans-Neptunian objects correspond only slightly to water on Earth. In January 2018, researchers reported that two 4.5 billion-year-old meteorites found on Earth contained liquid water alongside a wide diversity of deuterium-poor organic matter.\n\nLarge-enough planetesimals were heated by the decay of aluminium-26. This could cause water to rise to the surface. Recent studies suggest that water with similar deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio was already available at the time of Earth's formation, as evidenced in ancient eucrite meteorites originating from the asteroid Vesta.\n\nThat Earth's water originated purely from comets is implausible, since a result of measurements of the isotope ratios of deuterium to protium (D/H ratio) in the four comets Halley, Hyakutake, Hale–Bopp, and 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, by researchers such as David Jewitt, is approximately double that of oceanic water. What is, however, unclear is whether these comets are representative of those from the Kuiper belt. According to Alessandro Morbidelli, the largest part of today's water comes from protoplanets formed in the outer asteroid belt that plunged towards Earth, as indicated by the D/H proportions in carbon-rich chondrites. The water in carbon-rich chondrites point to a similar D/H ratio as oceanic water. Nevertheless, mechanisms have been proposed to suggest that the D/H-ratio of oceanic water may have increased significantly throughout Earth's history. Such a proposal is consistent with the possibility that a significant amount of the water on Earth was already present during the planet's early evolution.\n\nRecent measurements of the chemical composition of Moon rocks suggest that Earth was born with its water already present. Investigating lunar samples carried to Earth by the Apollo 15 and 17 missions found a deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio that matched the isotopic ratio in carbonaceous chondrites. The ratio is also similar to that found in water on Earth. The findings suggest a common source of water for both objects. This supports a theory that Jupiter temporarily migrated into the inner Solar System, destabilizing the orbits of water-rich carbonaceous chondrites. As a result, some of the bodies could have fallen inwards and become part of the raw material for making Earth and its neighbors. The discovery of water vapor out-gassing from Ceres provides related information on water-ice content of the asteroid belt.\n\nGradual \"dehydration melting\"—leakage of water stored in hydrate minerals of Earth's rocks—could have formed a portion of its water. Water may also have come from volcanism: water vapor in the atmosphere that originated in volcanic eruptions may have condensed to form rain, slowly filling Earth's oceanic basins.\n\nA sizeable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth. Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less massive during its formation. Hydrogen and helium are expected to leak from the atmosphere continually, but the lack of denser noble gases in the modern atmosphere suggests that something disastrous happened to the early atmosphere.\n\nPart of the young planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the impact which created the Moon, which should have caused melting of one or two large areas. Present composition does not match complete melting and it is hard to melt and mix huge rock masses completely. However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact, creating a rock-vapor atmosphere around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy carbon dioxide atmosphere with hydrogen and water vapor. Liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of because of the atmospheric pressure of the heavy CO atmosphere. As cooling continued, subduction and dissolving in ocean water removed most CO from the atmosphere but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and mantle cycles appeared.\n\nStudy of zircons has found that liquid water must have existed as long ago as 4.404 ± 0.008 Ga, very soon after the formation of Earth. This requires the presence of an atmosphere. The Cool early Earth theory covers a range from about 4.4 Ga to 4.0 Ga.\n\nIn fact, recent studies of zircons (in the fall of 2008) found in Australian Hadean rock hold minerals that point to the existence of plate tectonics as early as 4 billion years ago. If this holds true, the previous beliefs about the Hadean period are far from correct. That is, rather than a hot, molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, Earth's surface would be very much like it is today. The action of plate tectonics traps vast amounts of carbon dioxide, thereby reducing greenhouse effects, and leading to a much cooler surface temperature, and the formation of solid rock, and possibly even life.\n\nSome terrestrial water may have had a biochemical origin, during the Great Oxygenation Event, via redox reactions and photosynthesis.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Cornelis van Niel discovered that sulfide-dependent chemoautotrophic bacteria (purple sulfur bacteria) fix carbon and synthesize water as a byproduct of a photosynthetic pathway using hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide:\n\nFew modern organisms use this method of photosynthesis, making their water contribution negligible. But on the hydrogen-sulfide-rich and oxygen-poor early Earth, a small but significant portion of Earth's water may have been synthesized biochemically through this pathway.\n\n"}
{"id": "1678076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1678076", "title": "Patriarchal age", "text": "Patriarchal age\n\nThe patriarchal age is the era of the three biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, according to the narratives of Genesis 12–50. (These chapters also contain the history of Joseph, although Joseph is not one of the patriarchs.) It is preceded in the Bible by the primeval history and followed by The Exodus.\n\nThe Bible contains an intricate pattern of chronologies from the creation of Adam, the first man, to the reigns of the later kings of ancient Israel and Judah. Based on this chronology and the Rabbinic tradition, ancient Jewish sources such as Seder Olam Rabbah date the birth of Abraham to 1948 AM (c. 1813 BCE) and place the death of Jacob in 2255 AM (c. 1506 BCE).\n\nHistory known and dateable independently from the Bible first makes contact with the Scriptures during the era of the first Jewish kings. As such, the events before this period came to be disputed with the advent of biblical criticism in the 19th century. Little interest in questioning the biblical chronology existed before then, but with the development of the documentary hypothesis – the theory that the Pentateuch, including the Book of Genesis, was composed not by Moses but by unknown authors living at various times between 950 and 450 BC.\n\nOut of this heated debate between the various theories of biblical criticism and traditional, religious interpretations was born biblical archaeology, a form of archaeology different from others in that it sought not to discover and interpret mute evidence, but to validate or invalidate the historicity of the patriarchs and the events surrounding their lives, as described within the Bible.\n\nThe most eminent of early biblical archaeologists was William F. Albright, who believed that he had identified the patriarchal age in the period 2100–1800 BC, the Intermediate Bronze Age, the interval between two periods of highly developed urban culture in ancient Canaan. Albright argued that he had found evidence of the sudden collapse of the previous Early Bronze Age culture, and ascribed this to the invasion of migratory pastoral nomads from the northeast whom he identified with the Amorites mentioned in Mesopotamian texts. According to Albright, Abraham was a wandering Amorite who migrated from the north into the central highlands of Canaan and the Negev with his flocks and followers as the Canaanite city-states collapsed. Albright, E. A. Speiser and Cyrus Gordon argued that although the texts described by the documentary hypothesis were written centuries after the patriarchal age, archaeology had shown that they were nevertheless an accurate reflection of the conditions of the 2nd millennium BC: \"We can assert with full confidence that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were actual historical individuals.\"\n\nAlbright's interpretation came under fierce criticism as archaeology unearthed apparent anachronisms in the biblical accounts of the patriarchal age, in some cases suggesting that some of the texts were written later than the traditional dates. For example, in Genesis 21:32, Abraham apparently encounters Philistines, who (according to archaeology) actually did not settle in the Middle East until the 12th century BCE. However, usage of future place names had been a known Scriptural phenomenon to Jewish scholars for centuries prior to the biblical criticism movement.\n\nExcavations in the Timna Valley from 2014 discovered what may be the earliest domesticated camel bones found in Israel or even anywhere outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This has been described as evidence that the stories of Abraham, Joseph, Jacob and Esau were written after this time. Albright himself saw camels in the Bible as an anachronism. However, earlier excavations from elsewhere in the Middle East have uncovered domesticated camel bones in a house dating from ca. 2400 BCE, and that there exist written records and pictorial depictions of camels as pack animals much before 930 BCE, even from prior to ca. 1700 BCE, and again on a cylinder seal dating stylistically from ca. 1400 BCE or earlier. Although these older findings were not in Israel itself, they remain suggestive, coming from Bahrain, Minoa, Babylonia and even as close as Syria.\n\n"}
{"id": "27816236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27816236", "title": "Poet shirt", "text": "Poet shirt\n\nA poet shirt (also known as a poet blouse or pirate shirt) is a type of shirt made as a loose-fitting blouse with full bishop sleeves, usually decorated with large frills on the front and on the cuffs. Typically, it has a laced-up V-neck opening, designed to pull over the head, but can have a full-length opening fastened by buttons. The collar may be standing or folded over with points. Fabrics commonly used in its manufacture include linen, cotton, velvet and satin, while frills may be of the same fabric or of lace. Originally intended as a male garment, it is also worn by women today (though still interchangeably referred to as both a \"shirt\" and a \"blouse\" regardless of which gender is wearing it).\n\nAlthough descended from the shirts worn by men in the 17th and 18th centuries, the modern poet blouse combines two aspects: the fineness of ruffled shirts worn as an undergarment by aristocrats and the informality of plain shirts worn (normally open-necked) as a standalone garment by workmen. Inspired by Romanticism, it was a popular style for boys during the 19th century and for the pseudo-historical costumes worn by Hollywood actors portraying characters such as swordsmen or pirates during the 20th century. \n\nOne example of this is professional musician/actor Meat Loaf, who has been known for his eccentric on-stage attire since the late 1970s, which typically consists of either sequined black vests, or a tuxedo consisting of a black blazer, matching pants & shoes, and a white poet blouse with a red handkerchief, which he holds in his hand or ties to the microphone stand. Many fans & music reviewers such as inthestudio.net would come to refer to this look as his \"prom tux\" in popular culture, as this type of suit is most commonly associated with high school proms.\n\nA tailored version of the poet shirt became highly fashionable for young men during the 1960s, particularly in London. Jane Ormsby Gore described her discussions at that time with her then husband, Michael Rainey, who owned a men's clothing shop in Chelsea: \"We were very influenced by Byron … those Byron shirts with frilly fronts and big sleeves\". Epitomised by bands such as Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, the vogue for androgynous frilly blouses played a significant part in the New Romantic male fashion of the 1980s. Today, the style remains popular in some modern movements such as the Goth subculture, where it may be valued simply for its romantic or swashbuckling image, intended as part of a themed costume (e.g. vampire) or worn in defiance of mainstream conventions as a deliberate expression of gender ambiguity (in the same tradition as glam rock).\n\nA ruffled poet shirt, often worn with a wide belt or other item of clothing traditionally associated with pirates, has been the central theme of a spate of fashion trends stimulated by the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" series of adventure films, the first of which was released in 2003.\n"}

In 1823 Alexander secretly removed his brother Constantine from the order of succession, after Constantine informed Alexander he had no intention of ruling the Empire, and appointed Nicholas heir presumptive. Unprecedented secrecy backfired with a dynastic crisis that placed the whole House of Romanov at peril. Only three men, apart from Alexander himself, were fully aware of his decision, and none of them was present in the Winter Palace when the news of Alexander's death reached Saint Petersburg on 1825.\n\nMilitary governor Mikhail Miloradovich persuaded hesitant Nicholas to pledge allegiance to Constantine, who then lived in Warsaw as the viceroy of Poland. The State Council, faced with a legal Gordian Knot, concurred with Miloradovich; the civil government and the troops stationed in Saint Petersburg recognized Constantine as their sovereign – a sovereign who did not intend to reign. As \"The Times of London\" observed, the Russian Empire had \"two self-denying Emperors and no active ruler\". Correspondence between Saint Petersburg and Warsaw, carried by mounted messengers, took two weeks. Constantine repeated his renunciation of the crown and blessed Nicholas as his sovereign but refused to come to Saint Petersburg, leaving the dangerous task of resolving the crisis to Nicholas alone.\n\nEvidence of the brewing Decembrist revolt compelled Nicholas to act. In the first hour of he proclaimed himself Emperor of All the Russias. By noon the civil government and most of the troops of Saint Petersburg pledged allegiance to Nicholas but the Decembrists incited three thousand soldiers in support of Constantine and took a stand on Senate Square. Nicholas crushed the revolt at a cost of 1,271 lives and became an undisputed sovereign. He ruled the empire in an authoritative reactionary manner for 29 years.\n\nThe first historic study of the interregnum, Modest von Korff's \"Accession of Nicholas I\", was commissioned by Nicholas himself. Memoirists, historians and fiction authors sought alternative explanations of the apparently irrational behaviour of the Romanovs. Conspiracy theorists named Alexander, Nicholas, Miloradovich and Dowager Empress Maria, alone or in various alliances, as the driving forces behind the events of November–December 1825.\n\nAlexander I of Russia, the elder of four sons of Paul I, had no male issue; his legitimate daughters died in infancy. According to the 1797 Pauline Laws his childless brother Constantine had been heir presumptive since Alexander's accession. The third brother, Nicholas, followed him in the order of succession. Constantine and his legitimate wife Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld separated in 1799. Juliane returned to Germany and resisted any proposals to restore the family. Constantine, engaged in the action of the Napoleonic Wars, did not attempt a formal divorce until meeting Joanna Grudzińska. Their love affair that began in 1815 compelled Constantine to divorce Juliane and marry Joanna.\n\nConstantine divorced Juliane \"in absentia\" on , 1820. On the same day Alexander appended the Pauline Laws with a principle that a marriage between a member of the House of Romanov and a person of lesser standing could not confer on the latter the rights of the House, and that their offspring were barred from the order of succession. On of the same year, Constantine married Joanna, who was created Duchess of Łowicz. Constantine had no intention of ruling the Empire and retired to Warsaw as the viceroy of Congress Poland. According to Nicholas, Alexander told him of Constantine's decision to abdicate in 1819. According to Michael, the youngest of four brothers, he learned about it from Constantine in the summer of 1821. In both cases the speakers emphasized extreme secrecy of the matter.\n\nKorff wrote that Constantine's renunciation \"was completed or, at all events, received its final arrangement\" in the very end of 1821 when all four brothers reunited in Saint Petersburg. On , 1822 Constantine sent \"a humble petition\" to Alexander, expressing his \"wish\" to pass the rights to the throne to the next in line, Nicholas. Two weeks later Alexander wrote to Constantine that the matter was still not resolved. The closing paragraph was especially ambiguous and could have been interpreted as leaving the final outcome in Constantine's hands: \"It therefore remains to herself [Empress Maria] as well as to me ... to leave you \"fully at liberty\" to execute your \"irrevocable\" determination...\".\n\nIn the summer of 1823 minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs Alexander Golitsyn, acting on behalf of Alexander, asked Archbishop of Moscow Filaret to draft a formal manifest that would seal the \"final arrangement\" made a year and a half earlier. Alexander's usual speechwriter Mikhail Speransky was cut out the loop. Golitsyn instructed Filaret to lock the signed manifest, in utmost secrecy, in the sanctuary of the Assumption Cathedral in Moscow. Filaret feared that a document locked in Moscow could not influence the transfer of power to the successor, which would normally take place in Saint Petersburg, and objected to Alexander. The tsar reluctantly agreed and ordered Golitsyn to make three copies and deposit them in sealed envelopes in the Synod, the Senate and the State Council in Saint Petersburg. Although Filaret insisted that at least the existence of these envelopes must be made known to reliable witnesses, the whole affair \"has been preserved as in a tomb, the Imperial secret involving the existence of the empire\".\n\nAlexander signed the manifest in Tsarskoye Selo on , 1823 and brought it to Moscow himself on . According to Alexander's handwriting on the envelope it was \"to be opened by the Diocesan of the See of Moscow and the General-Governor of Moscow in the cathedral of Assumption, \"before taking any other steps\".\" Four days later Filaret took the envelope inside the cathedral, showed Alexander's seal to three priests and locked the Manifest in the altar. Governor of Moscow Dmitry Golitsyn remained unaware of the affair altogether.\n\nThe \"Saint Petersburg copies\", handwritten by Alexander Golitsyn and bearing Alexander's own handwriting on the envelopes, were filed three months later, raising short-lived speculations among the \"completely ignorant dignitaries\". Apart from Alexander, only Aleksey Arakcheyev, Alexander Golitsyn and Filaret were certainly aware of the existence, contents and location of the manifest and its copies. According to Korff, Empress Maria was actively engaged in the events of 1821–1822 and knew of the \"final arrangement\" but not its implementation. Constantine, Nicholas, Michael and Alexander's wife Elisabeth knew even less. The reasons for unprecedented secrecy are unknown. Nicholas's bad reputation among the troops is a common explanation. Anatole Mazour wrote that Nicholas was \"unacceptable to political circles and most unpleasant to military men\"; as the inspector of the Guards he \"aroused both the displeasures of higher officers and the hatred of the privates\"; but Mazour also admitted that Constantine was \"scarcely more agreeable to the military men\". Riasanovsky suggested that Alexander wanted to retain freedom to change the 1823 manifest at will.\n\nAfter the end of the Napoleonic Wars the Russian economy, ravaged by the Continental System and Napoleon's invasion, slid into a continuous economic crisis. Grain exports were high in 1816–1817, but in 1818–1819 Western European crops recovered and Russian exports plummeted. Landed gentry tried to restore lost income through enclosures and driving away redundant serf peasants, but Alexander outlawed \"emancipation\" of serfs without land. Economic downfall fuelled radical opposition inside Russian nobility: \"it was Alexander's failures to live up to their hopes that led them to take on the task to themselves\".\n\nThe imperial treasury was bankrupted by rising state debt and falling revenues. Alexander was aware of the crisis but never tackled its root cause, the oversized peacetime army of 800,000 men. Alexander expected future wars in Southern Europe and the Middle East, and feared that mass dismissal of veteran soldiers would cause insurrection. He could not let them go: they were not needed in their native villages, and there were no jobs in the cities. Instead of reducing the army to an affordable peacetime size, Alexander tried to cut spending through the establishment of self-sustaining military settlements, which failed \"from start to finish\". He replaced expensive field maneuvers with drill exercise and parades, alienating experienced commanders and contributing to dissatisfaction of the nobility.\n\nThe first secret organization aspiring to change the system was formed by the veterans of Napoleonic Wars in February 1816. Their aims varied from establishing a constitutional monarchy to \"getting rid of foreigners and alien influence\". Some even considered murdering Alexander I after Sergey Trubetskoy reported a rumour that Alexander was planning to incorporate western provinces into Congress Poland. In 1818 the organization was reformed into the Union of Prosperity. In the same year Pavel Pestel, the most radical conspirator, relocated to Ukraine and began actively recruiting Army officers, the core of the future Southern Society.\n\nIn January 1821 internal conflicts between the radical South and the aristocratic North led to the dissolution of the Union of Prosperity. Members of the Northern Society indulged in writing elaborate aristocratic constitutions while Pestel and his ring settled on changing the regime by military force. Pestel's own political program, influenced by Antoine Destutt de Tracy, Adam Smith, Baron d'Holbach and Jeremy Bentham envisioned \"one nation, one government, one language\" for the whole country, a uniform Russian-speaking entity with no concessions to ethnic or religious minorities, even the Finns or the Mongols. Contrary to the aspirations of the Northern Society, Pestel planned to reduce the influence of landed and financial aristocracy, \"the main obstacle to national welfare that could be eliminated only under a republican form of government.\"\n\nPestel's influence gradually radicalized the Northern Society and helped in bringing the two groups together. Twice, in 1823 and 1824, the North and the South planned joint strikes against Alexander. The Southern terrorists subscribed to kidnap or kill Alexander during military maneuvers, the North was tasked with inciting revolt in Saint Petersburg. In both cases Alexander changed his itinerary and evaded the rebels. His informers reported a fragmented picture of the conspiracy; Alexander had no secret police and managed the investigation personally on \"ad hoc\" basis. Pestel's third plan shifted the center of insurgence to Saint Petersburg but the death of Alexander caught the conspirators unprepared.\n\nOn , 1825 Alexander left Saint Petersburg to accompany the ailing Empress Elizabeth to spa treatment in Taganrog, then a \"rather agreeable town\" on the coast of Sea of Azov. Golitsyn pleaded with Alexander to publish the secret manifest of 1823 but the emperor refused: \"Let us rely on God. He will know how to order things better than us mortals.\" The statesmen who accompanied Alexander – Pyotr Volkonsky, Hans Karl von Diebitsch and Alexander Chernyshyov – were not aware of the manifest.\n\nAlexander and Elizabeth traveled to the south separately; he reached Taganrog , she ten days later. Their relations had considerably improved since the death of Alexander's illegitimate daughter Sophie Naryshkina in June 1824. The reunion in Taganrog, according to Volkonsky, became the couple's second honeymoon (Wortman noted that this and similar sentimental opinions, influenced by Nicholas's propaganda, should not be taken literally).\n\nAfter a stay with Elizabeth, Alexander left Taganrog on a tour of Crimea that was cut short by a bout of \"bilious remittent fever\" that struck Alexander on in Alupka. Return to Taganrog brought no improvement; on November 10 Alexander lost consciousness for the first time. He \"strenuously refused all medical assistance\" of his Scottish physician James Wylie. Diebitsch reported the state of Alexander's health to Constantine in Warsaw. The disease consumed Alexander and on it seemed that he was in terminal agony. Only then did Diebitsch and Volkonsky notify the court in Saint Petersburg of the inevitable.\n\nAlexander struggled for two more days and died at 10:50 on . At the moment of Alexander's demise, Constantine and Michael stayed in Warsaw, Nicholas and Empress Maria in Saint Petersburg. Of the three men entrusted with full knowledge of Alexander's manifest, only Golitsyn was present in Saint Petersburg.\n\nDiebitsch promptly dispatched a courier to \"His Majesty Emperor Constantine\" in Warsaw; a second courier left for Saint Petersburg with a letter for Empress Maria. The courier to Warsaw, owing to shorter distance and better roads, arrived at Constantine's palace two days ahead of the courier sent to Saint Petersburg. Constantine and Michael received the news in the evening of . Constantine immediately assembled his court and publicly renounced any claims to the throne. He spent all night drafting the responses to Diebitsch and to \"His Majesty Emperor Nicholas\" and Empress Maria in Saint Petersburg. The messenger, Grand Duke Michael, left Warsaw after dinner on .\n\nIn the evening of Governor-General of Saint Petersburg Mikhail Miloradovich brought the news of Alexander's terminal illness to Nicholas. News of Alexander's death arrived in Saint Petersburg on . After a brief meeting with his mother Nicholas publicly pledged his oath to \"Emperor Constantine\". While the public took the decision for granted, Maria was startled: \"Nicholas, what have you done? Didn't you know that \"you\" are heir presumptive?\" The oath sparked an unprecedented dynastic crisis: two principal contenders forfeited their rights in favor of each other in \"a hitherto unheard-of struggle — a struggle not for the acquisition of power, but for its renunciation!\". The throne remained vacant.\n\nNicholas took the secret of his decision to his grave. According to Korff, Nicholas did not know the provisions of the 1823 manifest and merely executed his legal and moral obligations. According to Sergey Trubetskoy, Nicholas was well aware of his rights but Miloradovich and general Alexander Voinov compelled him to step back. They met with Nicholas late in the evening of December 7. Miloradovich argued that Nicholas can not reign unless Constantine abdicates in public \"as a reigning Emperor\". Independent action by Nicholas, said Miloradovich, will provoke a civil war because the troops will stand for Constantine. Nicholas reluctantly submitted to the military opposition. Schilder, Hugh Seton-Watson, Gordin, Andreeva accepted Trubetskoy's account as genuine. Safonov dismissed it as disinformation planted by Nicholas to justify his moment of weakness.\n\nMiloradovich temporarily assumed dictatorial power. From this moment and until the outbreak of the Decembrist revolt Miloradovich maintained a confident demeanor and persuaded Nicholas that \"the city is quiet and tranquil\" despite mounting evidence to the contrary. Immediately after Nicholas's oath to Constantine Miloradovich instructed military commanders to administer the oath in their units. Miloradovich broke the law twice: by initiating the oath without Constantine's own accession manifest, and by initiating the oath in the troops before the civil government was sworn in.\n\nMiloradovich also took care of the original Manifest. His messenger arrived in Moscow on , and informed governor Dmitry Golitsyn that Constantine was now Emperor, that the city administration must be sworn immediately and that \"a certain packet which has been deposited in 1823 in the Cathedral\" must remain sealed. Filaret objected but was compelled to accept the facts. Moscow was sworn to Constantine , the 1st Army in Mogilev on .\n\nAlexander Golitsyn rushed to Nicholas as soon as learned of the \"fait accompli\". Their meeting revealed the depth of the legal crisis that Nicholas had just made worse. Nicholas refused to act contrary to his oath to Constantine; both parties \"separated with evident coolness\". At 2 p.m. Golitsyn opened the extraordinary session of the State Council. He explained that a copy of Alexander's manifest, written by his own hand, was waiting for the occasion right there, in State Council files, and \"bitterly deprecated the unnecessary precipitation in taking the oath\". Minister of Justice Lobanov-Rostovsky and admiral Shishkov opposed, insisting on the legality of oath to Constantine, but the majority temporarily leaned towards Golitsyn's stance.\n\nMiloradovich, again, interfered in favor of Constantine. According to Trubetskoy, who attended at the Council meeting, the Manifest was presented as Alexander's will, rather than a law. Miloradovich argued that the Emperor may not appoint a successor through a \"will\" that contradicts pre-existing \"laws\" of succession; the Council can examine the will but may not \"act\" upon it. According to Korff, the Council opened the secret envelope and read the manifest, but Miloradovich barred further talks with an argument that the manifest was already void: \"Nicholas has solemnly renounced the right conferred upon him by the said Manifest.\"\n\nCouncil members suddenly found themselves in an inconvenient position of \"a state authority rather than His Majesty's chancery\". Instead of acting on their own they herded into Nicholas' waiting room. Nicholas once again repeated his refusal of the throne and personally administered the council members' oath to Constantine. By the end of the day the case appeared to be closed and couriers rushed the news of Constantine's accession to all corners of the empire.\n\nOn Grand Duke Michael brought Constantine's letters to Saint Petersburg. Michael and Empress Maria persuaded Nicholas in the grave error he had made. Nicholas, now confident in his right to take the throne, realised that simply declaring himself emperor would, most likely, cause an insurrection. The only choice left, it seemed, was to invite Constantine to Saint Petersburg and have him formally abdicate in public. On the same day a courier rushed the invitation to Warsaw. On , Nicholas received a brief letter from Constantine, who firmly refused to travel to the capital, thus denying Nicholas any help in the succession crisis. \"If everything is not arranged in accordance with our late Emperor's will\", warned Constantine, \"I shall remove into a still more distant retirement.\"\n\nGovernment officials of all ranks expected the new tsar just as eagerly. On , Minister of Finance Georg von Cancrin ordered minting of a new coin bearing the profile of \"Emperor and Autocrat Constantine\". Cancrin attended the meeting of the State Council and was fully aware of the unfolding controversy, yet acted in confidence that Constantine was \"the\" emperor. This confidence persisted despite the suspicious silence of Grand Duke Michael and his retinue. Michael did not pledge allegiance to Constantine and evaded all inquiries about \"His Majesty\". Rumours and speculations made Michael's presence in the palace intolerable and the family council dominated by Empress Maria decided that he must return to Warsaw and personally persuade Constantine to come to Saint Petersburg.\n\nMaria gave Michael a mandate to intercept and read all letters that Constantine could send to her. Michael met with Constantine's courier at Nennal on . He understood that his mission could not change Constantine's will and decided that he might be more useful to the House in Saint Petersburg rather than Warsaw. He was not mistaken; his arrival in Saint Petersburg on the day of Decembrist revolt became a vital factor in persuading the troops in favor of Nicholas.\n\nAt 6 a.m. Saturday, , Colonel Frederics brought Nicholas the \"most urgent\" report of the mounting conspiracy. The report, authored by Diebitsch and handwritten by Chernyshyov, was addressed to \"His Majesty Emperor Constantine\" – one copy to Saint Petersburg, another one to Warsaw. Hesitating, Nicholas opened the package and \"was overwhelmed with unspeakable horror\" of the conspiracy among his own Guards. Diebitsch was confident in containing mutiny in his troops but, as for the rebels in Saint Peterburg and Moscow, he could only provide names.\n\nNicholas, still hoping to \"conceal the whole affair in the closest secrecy\" particularly from his mother, summoned Miloradovich and Alexander Golitsyn – the men who already earned his displeasure but whose offices were vital in maintaining order. A quick search for the people named by Diebitsch brought no result: all were away on furlough, said Miloradovich, and again assured Nicholas that \"the city is tranquil\". In fact, one person named in the report, cornet Svistunov, was present in Saint Peterburg and actively coordinated the rebels.\n\nAt 9 p.m. of the same day Nicholas received a cryptic and threatening message from Yakov Rostovtsev. Rostovtsev's report did not specify any names but threatened Nicholas with a multitude of disasters. Surprisingly well informed about the correspondence between Saint Petersburg and Warsaw, Rostovtsev advised Nicholas to go to Warsaw himself rather than wait for Constantine. His report, \"a candle to the Lord and to Satan\", sounded like an ultimatum: \"You have seriously irritated a great number against you. In the name of your own glory I entreat you not to hasten to reign.\" Nicholas did not heed Rostovtsev's proposals which ran completely contrary to his plans. In another irrational twist, he treated Rostovtsev with respect and affection, and shielded him from prosecution.\n\nIn the afternoon of Nicholas received a letter from Constantine. Once again, Constantine refused to come to Saint Peterburg and blessed Nicholas onto the throne. The letter \"terminated all indecision\" and started the countdown of \"a virtual coup d'etat\". Nicholas sent a courier for Michael and summoned Nikolay Karamzin to prepare the draft of his accession manifest. He then summoned three key officials representing the Church, the Guards and the civil government, and ordered them to convene a State Council meeting at 8 p.m. of the next day. The timing, thought Nicholas, allowed just enough time to bring in Michael, the living proof of his good faith. The rest of the government, and most importantly the troops, were to be sworn on the following morning. Nicholas wrote: \"On the 14th I will be Emperor or dead.\"\n\nTwenty-three members of the State Council arrived in due time but Nicholas delayed the announcement for hours, waiting for Michael. Soon after midnight, in the very beginning of , Nicholas realized that no more delays were possible, and walked into the Council hall alone. He \"seated himself in the place of the President\" and read his accession manifest. This, according to Korff, was the first ever precedent when the State Council convened at night. Nicholas went at lengths in explaining how the legal uncertainty set by Alexander lured him into pledging allegiance to Constantine. He specifically required \"that the time of Our accession to the Throne be counted from the 19th day of November 1825\", the day of Alexander's death, sealing the fact that Constantine had never reigned and that the oath to Constantine was merely a misunderstanding rectified by Nicholas. The State Council accepted the fact without further discussion and was dismissed at about 1 a.m.\n\n, \"the longest day\" of Nicholas I, coincided with the winter solstice: the sun rose at 9:04 and set at 2:58. Nicholas assembled military commanders before sunrise. He again explained the background and motives for his decision. There were no objections, and the officers left to administer the oath to Nicholas in their units.\n\nMiloradovich did not attend this meeting. He arrived at the palace later and again assured Nicholas of \"calm and tranquility\", dismissing available intelligence. His police spectacularly failed in \"a concurrence of other strange blunders, which it is difficult to explain at present\". Nicholas made a blunder of his own, by not printing and distributing copies of the Manifest and thus contributing to the rising agitation among civilians. Decembrists were disorganized: their \"dictator\" Sergey Trubetskoy did not show up at all, \"the bravest men among the leaders developed an apathy and unwonted lack of nerve.\" Like the tsar, they did not attempt to recruit civilian masses.\n\nOath in the troops proceeded smoothly until the men of Horse Artillery Regiment demanded personal assurance from Grand Duke Michael. Michael had just arrived in Saint Petersburg and Nicholas immediately sent him to speak to the troops. At about noon Nicholas learned of the greater threat, the insurrection of the Moscow Regiment. Shouting \"Hurrah for Constantine\", the rebels took a stand in formation on the Senate Square, encouraged by the masses of civilians. By noon the rebel forces on the square counted three thousand men, against already present nine thousand loyalists. Nicholas was there, \"pale, weary, and eager to settle the whole affair as soon as possible.\"\n\nAt around 12:30 Miloradovich tried to speak to the rebel troops and was fatally shot by Pyotr Kakhovsky and stabbed by Yevgeny Obolensky. Wilhelm Küchelbecker attempted shooting Grand Duke Michael. Another negotiator, Metropolitan Serafim, was forced away from the square. Nicholas, still hoping to avoid bloodshed, ordered an intimidating cavalry charge against the rebels. It miserably failed as horses lost balance and fell on icy pavement. As time passed by, civilians flooded the square, forming a dense circle around the loyalists troops. Nicholas feared that the mob may overwhelm his troops after sunset. Worse, he saw his own soldiers defecting to the rebels.\n\nGenerals pressed Nicholas for action, Karl Wilhelm von Toll reproached him: \"Let me clear the square with gunfire or abdicate!\". At around 4 p.m. Nicholas ordered artillery fire against the rebels who did not dare to attack the batteries or otherwise change the outcome in their favour. Canister shots killed more civilians than rebel soldiers. Their flight from the square was checked by loyalist battalions blocking escape routes. Tsarist propaganda reported 80 dead, later studies counted at least 1,271 dead, 903 of them civilians of low birth.\n\nThe Southern Society attempted their own revolt: one thousand men of the Chernigov Regiment led by Sergey Muravyov-Apostol and Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin ravaged Ukrainian towns and evaded government troops until a defeat at Kovalivka on , 1826. Hugh Seton-Watson wrote that it was \"the first and the last political revolt by army officers\"; Nicholas and his successors eradicated liberalism in the troops and secured their unconditional loyalty. Immediately after suppressing the revolt in Saint Petersburg Nicholas took control of the investigation. Of six hundred suspects 121 were put on trial. Five leaders were hanged, others exiled to Siberia; Nicholas commuted most sentences in a demonstration of good will, sending the least offenders to fight as soldiers in the Caucasian War. Soldiers of the mutinous regiments were run through the gauntlet. Some died, others ended up fighting in the Caucasus or exiled in Siberia. According to Anatole Mazour, the sentence was unusually harsh and revengeful; according to Seton-Watson, it was in line with European practice of the time, but nevertheless contributed to public perception of Nicholas as \"a dark and sinister figure\" and of the Decembrists as selfless martyrs.\n\n\"Challenge to Nicholas rule created an atmosphere of hostility, bitterness and fear ... it remained imprinted in Nicholas's mind as a traumatic moment that justified intensified surveillance and police persecution.\" Contrary to Alexander's public image of a liberal conqueror, Nicholas chose to present himself as the defender of order, a distinctively Russian nationalist leader protecting the nation from foreign evils. Lack of public support encouraged Nicholas to stage grand ceremonial events; the whole reign was marked by sentimental \"demonstrations of attachments and love\" to the tsar \"who had evoked only antipathy\". He celebrated the day of his victory over the revolt with for the rest of his life, but the facts and analysis of 1825 events remained censored, contributing to the \"Decembrist myth\".\n\nNicholas studied the grievances exposed in the 1826 investigation and incorporated them in his own reform program. Despite his good intentions, his administration evolved into an overcentralized, oversized and incompetent system. Instead of managing the country for Nicholas, the system \"loaded him with an innumerable magnitude of trivial affairs\". It was infested with laziness, indifference and corruption on all levels, although Seton-Watson wrote that the degree of bureaucratic vice has been exaggerated by contemporary critics.\n\nConstantine remained Viceroy of Poland until the November uprising and died in 1831 of cholera. He was \"the only person treated by Nicholas as his equal and associate rather than a servant.\" Nicholas and Michael remained close until Michael's death of a stroke in 1849, although Michael's militarism and tyranny over subordinates regularly annoyed Nicholas.\n\nIn 1847 Nicholas commissioned historian Modest von Korff to write the first history of the interregnum and the Decembrist revolt. Korff received limited but then unprecedented access to private records of the Romanovs and personally interviewed surviving high-ranking witnesses. The first edition, approved by Nicholas, was published in 1848 in mere twenty-five copies. The third, and the first \"public\" edition, was published in 1857 simultaneously in Russian, English, French and German languages. Korff's account, despite constraints of censorship, remains \"the\" mainstream version of the interregnum, but not the revolt. It was accepted in Imperial Russian (Schilder) and Soviet historiography (Militsa Nechkina) and in Western academia (Anatole Mazour, Vladimir Nabokov, Hugh Seton-Watson).\n\nMemoirs of the Decembrists contradicted official history and each other. Sergey Trubetskoy, referring to the first report of Alexander's terminal illness received in Saint Petersburg , wrote that \"the thought of the successor frightened everybody because the successor \"was unknown\".\" Andrey Rosen (1799–1884) wrote on the subject of Nicholas's oath to Constantine that \"Count Miloradowitsch and Prince A. N. Galitzine, who knew the tenor of Alexander's will, exerted themselves in vain to prevent so doing, but Nicholas would not hear of any objection ... it was nevertheless \"everywhere known\" that Constantine has abdicated and that a will of Alexander's was in existence transferring the government to Nicholas... The members of the Senate knew that, since 1823, a will of Alexander's lay among their archives.\" Rosen also speculated that because Nicholas \"knew all along of the existence of secret societies\" he voluntarily stepped aside \"to avoid in this way any occasion of disturbance and discontent.\"\n\nSoviet historians concentrated on studies of the Decembrist movement and treated the interregnum as an insignificant episode in the grand picture of class struggle. Interregnum resurfaced as an independent research topic in the 1970s. Historians, biographers and fiction authors sought alternative explanations of irrational events and named Alexander, Nicholas, Miloradovich and Empress Maria, alone or in various combinations, as the secret driving forces of the interregnum. None of these alternatives received wide support in academia.\n\n\n"}

Other ships bearing the name have included of the 1875–1876 British Arctic Expedition to the North Pole and , which led the 1901–1904 \"Discovery Expedition\" to Antarctica.\n\n\"Discovery\" launched the Hubble Space Telescope and conducted the second and third Hubble service missions. It also launched the \"Ulysses\" probe and three TDRS satellites. Twice \"Discovery\" was chosen as the \"Return To Flight\" Orbiter, first in 1988 after the loss of \"Challenger\" in 1986, and then again for the twin \"Return To Flight\" missions in July 2005 and July 2006 after the \"Columbia\" disaster in 2003. Project Mercury astronaut John Glenn, who was 77 at the time, flew with \"Discovery\" on STS-95 in 1998, making him the oldest person to go into space.\n\nHad plans to launch United States Department of Defense payloads from Vandenberg Air Force Base gone ahead, \"Discovery\" would have become the dedicated US Air Force shuttle. Its first West Coast mission, STS-62-A, was scheduled for 1986, but canceled in the aftermath of \"Challenger\".\n\n\"Discovery\" was retired after completing its final mission, STS 133 on March 9, 2011. The spacecraft is now on display in Virginia at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum.\n\n\"Discovery\" weighed roughly 3600 kg (3.6t) less than \"Columbia\" when it was brought into service due to optimizations determined during the construction and testing of \"Enterprise\", \"Columbia\" and \"Challenger\". \"Discovery\" weighs heavier than \"Atlantis\" and heavier than \"Endeavour\".\n\nPart of the \"Discovery\" weight optimizations included the greater use of quilted AFRSI blankets rather than the white LRSI tiles on the fuselage, and the use of graphite epoxy instead of aluminum for the payload bay doors and some of the wing spars and beams.\n\nUpon its delivery to the Kennedy Space Center in 1983, \"Discovery\" was modified alongside \"Challenger\" to accommodate the liquid-fueled Centaur-G booster, which had been planned for use beginning in 1986 but was cancelled in the wake of the \"Challenger\" disaster.\n\nBeginning in late 1995, the orbiter underwent a nine-month Orbiter Maintenance Down Period (OMDP) in Palmdale, California. This included outfitting the vehicle with a 5th set of cryogenic tanks and an external airlock to support missions to the International Space Station. As with all the orbiters, it could be attached to the top of specialized aircraft and did so in June 1996 when it returned to the Kennedy Space Center, and later in April 2012 when sent to the Udvar-Hazy Center, riding piggy-back on a modified Boeing 747.\n\nAfter STS-105, \"Discovery\" became the first of the orbiter fleet to undergo Orbiter Major Modification (OMM) period at the Kennedy Space Center. Work began in September 2002 to prepare the vehicle for Return to Flight. The work included scheduled upgrades and additional safety modifications.\n\n\"Discovery\" was decommissioned on March 9, 2011.\n\nNASA offered \"Discovery\" to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum for public display and preservation, after a month-long decontamination process, as part of the national collection. \"Discovery\" replaced in the Smithsonian's display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia. \"Discovery\" was transported to Washington Dulles International Airport on April 17, 2012, and was transferred to the Udvar-Hazy on April 19 where a welcome ceremony was held. Afterwards, at around 5: 30 pm, \"Discovery\" was rolled to its \"final wheels stop\" in the Udvar Hazy Center.\n\nBy its last mission, \"Discovery\" had flown 149 million miles (238 million km) in 39 missions, completed 5,830 orbits, and spent 365 days in orbit over 27 years. \"Discovery\" flew more flights than any other Orbiter Shuttle, including four in 1985 alone. \"Discovery\" flew all three \"return to flight\" missions after the \"Challenger\" and \"Columbia\" disasters: STS-26 in 1988, STS-114 in 2005, and STS-121 in 2006. \"Discovery\" flew the ante-penultimate mission of the Space Shuttle program, STS-133, having launched on February 24, 2011. \"Endeavour\" flew STS-134 and \"Atlantis\" performed STS-135, NASA's last Space Shuttle mission. On February 24, 2011, Space Shuttle \"Discovery\" launched from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39-A to begin its final orbital flight.\n\nThe Flow Director was responsible for the overall preparation of the shuttle for launch and processing it after landing, and remained permanently assigned to head the spacecraft's ground crew while the astronaut flight crews changed for every mission. Each shuttle's Flow Director was supported by a Vehicle Manager for the same spacecraft. Space Shuttle \"Discovery\"'s Flow Directors were:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30636", "title": "Terrorism", "text": "Terrorism\n\nTerrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror among masses of people; or fear to achieve a religious or political aim. It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence against peacetime targets or in war against non-combatants. The terms \"terrorist\" and \"terrorism\" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity during the U.S. presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–89) after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and again after the 2001 September 11 attacks and the 2002 Bali bombings.\n\nThere is no commonly accepted definition of \"terrorism\". Being a charged term, with the connotation of something \"morally wrong\", it is often used, both by governments and non-state groups, to abuse or denounce opposing groups. Broad categories of political organisations have been claimed to have been involved in terrorism to further their objectives, including right-wing and left-wing political organisations, nationalist groups, religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. Terrorism-related legislation has been adopted in various states, regarding \"terrorism\" as a crime. There is no universal agreement as to whether or not \"terrorism\", in some definition, should be regarded as a war crime.\n\nAccording to the Global Terrorism Database maintained by the University of Maryland, College Park, more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, have been recorded from 2000 to 2014.\n\nEtmologically, the word terror is derived from the Latin verb \"Tersere\", which later becomes \"Terrere\". The latter form appears in European languages as early as the 12th century; its first known use in French is the word \"terrible\" in 1160. By 1356 the word \"terreur\" is in use. \"Terreur\" is the origin of the Middle English term \"terrour\", which later becomes the modern word \"terror\".\n\nThe term \"terroriste\", meaning \"terrorist\", is first used in 1794 by the French philosopher François-Noël Babeuf, who denounces Maximilien Robespierres Jacobin regime as a dictatorship. In the years leading up to the Reign of Terror, the Brunswick Manifesto threatened Paris with an \"exemplary, never to be forgotten vengeance: the city would be subjected to military punishment and total destruction\" if the royal family was harmed, but this only increased the Revolution's will to abolish the monarchy. Some writers attitudes about French Revolution grew less favorable after the French monarchy was abolished in 1792. During the Reign of Terror, which began in July 1793 and lasted thirteen months, Paris was governed by the Committee of Public safety who oversaw a regime of mass executions and public purges.\n\nPrior to the French Revolution, ancient philosophers wrote about tyrannicide, as tyranny was seen as the greatest political threat to Greco-Roman civilization. Medieval philosophers were similarly occupied with the concept of tyranny, though the analysis of some theologians like Thomas Aquinas drew a distinction between usurpers, who could be killed by anyone, and legitimate rulers who abused their power — the latter, in Aquinas' view, could only be punished by a public authority. John of Salisbury was the first medieval Christian scholar to defend tyrannicide.\nMost scholars today trace the origins of the modern tactic of terrorism to the Jewish Sicarii Zealots who attacked Romans and Jews in 1st century Palestine. They follow its development from the Persian Order of Assassins through to 19th-century anarchists. The \"Reign of Terror\" is usually regarded as an issue of etymology. The term terrorism has generally been used to describe violence by non-state actors rather than government violence since the 19th-century Anarchist Movement.\n\nIn December 1795, Edmund Burke used the word \"Terrorists\" in a description of the new French government called 'Directory':\n\nAt length, after a terrible struggle, the [Directory] Troops prevailed over the Citizens (…) To secure them further, they have a strong corps of irregulars, ready armed. Thousands of those Hell-hounds called Terrorists, whom they had shut up in Prison on their last Revolution, as the Satellites of Tyranny, are let loose on the people.(emphasis added)\n\nThere are over 109 different definitions of terrorism. American political philosopher Michael Walzer in 2002 wrote: \"Terrorism is the deliberate killing of innocent people, at random, to spread fear through a whole population and force the hand of its political leaders\". Bruce Hoffman, an American scholar, has noted that\n\nIt is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus.\n\nC.A.J. Coady has written that the question of how to define terrorism is \"irresolvable\" because \"its natural home is in polemical, ideological and propagandist contexts\".\n\nFrench historian distinguishes between the revolutionary terror of the French Revolution and the terrorists of the September 11 attacks:\n\nRevolutionary terror is not terrorism. To make a moral equivalence between the Revolution's year II and September 2001 is historical and philosophical nonsense . . . The violence exercised on 11 September 2001 aimed neither at equality nor liberty. Nor did the preventive war announced by the president of the United States. \n\nExperts disagree about \"whether terrorism is wrong by definition or just wrong as a matter of fact; they disagree about whether terrorism should be defined in terms of its aims, or its methods, or both, or neither; they disagree about whether or not states can perpetrate terrorism; they even disagree about the importance or otherwise of \"terror\" for a definition of \"terrorism\".\"\n\nAlternatively, responding to developments in modern warfare, Paul James and Jonathan Friedman distinguish between state terrorism against non-combatants and state terrorism against combatants, including 'Shock and Awe' tactics:\n\nShock and Awe\" as a subcategory of \"rapid dominance\" is the name given to massive intervention designed to strike terror into the minds of the enemy. It is a form of state-terrorism. The concept was however developed long before the Second Gulf War by Harlan Ullman as chair of a forum of retired military personnel.\n\nIn November 2004, a Secretary-General of the United Nations report described terrorism as any act \"intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act\". The international community has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime. These difficulties arise from the fact that the term \"terrorism\" is politically and emotionally charged. In this regard, Angus Martyn, briefing the Australian parliament, stated,\nThe international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination.\n\nThese divergences have made it impossible for the United Nations to conclude a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism. The international community has adopted a series of sectoral conventions that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities.\n\nSince 1994, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism:\nCriminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.\n\nVarious legal systems and government agencies use different definitions of terrorism in their national legislation.\n\nU.S. Code Title 22 Chapter 38, Section 2656f(d) defines terrorism as:\n\"Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience\".\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2331 defines \"international terrorism\" and \"domestic terrorism\" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the Code, entitled \"Terrorism\":\n\n\"International terrorism\" means activities with the following three characteristics:\n\nInvolve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;\nAppear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and\noccur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.\n\nA definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:\n\nTerrorists also attack national symbols, which may negatively affect a government, while increasing the prestige of the given terrorist group or its ideology.\n\nTerrorist acts frequently have a political purpose. Some official, governmental definitions of terrorism use the criterion of the illegitimacy or unlawfulness of the act. to distinguish between actions authorized by a government (and thus \"lawful\") and those of other actors, including individuals and small groups. For example, carrying out a strategic bombing on an enemy city, which is designed to affect civilian support for a cause, would not be considered terrorism if it were authorized by a government. This criterion is inherently problematic and is not universally accepted, because: it denies the existence of state terrorism. An associated term is violent non-state actor.\n\nAccording to Ali Khan, the distinction lies ultimately in a political judgment.\n\nHaving the moral charge in our vocabulary of 'something morally wrong', the term 'terrorism' is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties, either governments or non-state-groups.\n\nThose labeled \"terrorists\" by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such, and typically use other terms or terms specific to their situation, such as separatist, freedom fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, paramilitary, guerrilla, rebel, patriot, or any similar-meaning word in other languages and cultures. Jihadi, mujaheddin, and fedayeen are similar Arabic words that have entered the English lexicon. It is common for both parties in a conflict to describe each other as terrorists.\n\nOn whether particular terrorist acts, such as killing non-combatants, can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance, philosophers have expressed different views: while, according to David Rodin, utilitarian philosophers can (in theory) conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good that could not be achieved in a less morally costly way, in practice the \"harmful effects of undermining the convention of non-combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism\". Among the non-utilitarian philosophers, Michael Walzer argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case: when \"a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants, then it is morally entitled to do so\".\n\nIn his book \"Inside Terrorism\" Bruce Hoffman offered an explanation of why the term \"terrorism\" becomes distorted:\n\nThe pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the aphorism, \"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\". This is exemplified when a group using irregular military methods is an ally of a state against a mutual enemy, but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally. During World War II, the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army was allied with the British, but during the Malayan Emergency, members of its successor (the Malayan Races Liberation Army), were branded \"terrorists\" by the British. More recently, Ronald Reagan and others in the American administration frequently called the mujaheddin \"freedom fighters\" during the Soviet–Afghan War yet twenty years later, when a new generation of Afghan men were fighting against what they perceive to be a regime installed by foreign powers, their attacks were labelled \"terrorism\" by George W. Bush. Groups accused of terrorism understandably prefer terms reflecting legitimate military or ideological action. Leading terrorism researcher Professor Martin Rudner, director of the Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies at Ottawa's Carleton University, defines \"terrorist acts\" as unlawful attacks for political or other ideological goals, and said:\nSome groups, when involved in a \"liberation\" struggle, have been called \"terrorists\" by the Western governments or media. Later, these same persons, as leaders of the liberated nations, are called \"statesmen\" by similar organizations. Two examples of this phenomenon are the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Menachem Begin and Nelson Mandela. WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange has been called a \"terrorist\" by Sarah Palin and Joe Biden.\n\nSometimes, states that are close allies, for reasons of history, culture and politics, can disagree over whether or not members of a certain organization are terrorists. For instance, for many years, some branches of the United States government refused to label members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) as terrorists while the IRA was using methods against one of the United States' closest allies (the United Kingdom) that the UK branded as terrorism. This was highlighted by the \"Quinn v. Robinson\" case.\n\nMedia outlets who wish to convey impartiality may limit their usage of \"terrorist\" and \"terrorism\" because they are loosely defined, potentially controversial in nature, and subjective terms.\n\nDepending on how broadly the term is defined, the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st-century AD. Sicarii Zealots, though some dispute whether the group, a radical offshoot of the Zealots which was active in Judaea Province at the beginning of the 1st century AD, was in fact terrorist. According to the contemporary Jewish-Roman historian Josephus, after the Zealotry rebellion against Roman rule in Judea, when some prominent Jewish collaborators with Roman rule were killed, Judas of Galilee formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots, the Sicarii, in 6 AD. Their terror was also directed against Jewish \"collaborators\", including temple priests, Sadducees, Herodians, and other wealthy elites.\n\nThe term \"terrorism\" itself was originally used to describe the actions of the Jacobin Club during the \"Reign of Terror\" in the French Revolution. \"Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible\", said Jacobin leader Maximilien Robespierre. In 1795, Edmund Burke denounced the Jacobins for letting \"thousands of those hell-hounds called Terrorists ... loose on the people\" of France.\n\nIn January 1858, Italian patriot Felice Orsini threw three bombs in an attempt to assassinate French Emperor Napoleon III. Eight bystanders were killed and 142 injured. The incident played a crucial role as an inspiration for the development of the early terrorist groups.\n\nArguably the first organization to utilize modern terrorist techniques was the Irish Republican Brotherhood, founded in 1858 as a revolutionary Irish nationalist group that carried out attacks in England. The group initiated the Fenian dynamite campaign in 1881, one of the first modern terror campaigns. Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination, this campaign used modern, timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain, in order to achieve political gains.\n\nAnother early terrorist group was Narodnaya Volya, founded in Russia in 1878 as a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by Sergei Nechayev and \"propaganda by the deed\" theorist Carlo Pisacane. The group developed ideas—such as targeted killing of the 'leaders of oppression'—that were to become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the age—such as the invention of dynamite, which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of—enabled them to strike directly and with discrimination.\n\nScholars of terrorism refer to four major waves of global terrorism: \"the Anarchist, the Anti-Colonial, the New Left, and the Religious. The first three have been completed and lasted around 40 years; the fourth is now in its third decade.\"\n\nDepending on the country, the political system, and the time in history, the types of terrorism are varying.\n\nIn early 1975, the Law Enforcement Assistant Administration in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was titled \"Disorders and Terrorism\", produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H. H. A. Cooper, Director of the Task Force staff.\n\nThe Task Force defines terrorism as \"a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes\". It classified disorders and terrorism into six categories:\n\nOther sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways, for example, broadly classifying it into domestic terrorism and international terrorism, or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism. One way the typology of terrorism may be defined:\n\nAs well as there being no one agreed definition of terrorism, there is a similar lack of consensus regarding the causes - or motivations behind - terrorism. Numerous studies have identified certain behavioural and situational characteristics that are common, and perhaps causal, to the consequence of terrorism, specific analysis of case studies have lead to suggested motivations to individual historical acts.\n\nA report conducted by Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert on behalf of The Department of security of UK highlights the vast discrepencies between individual cases of terrorism recorded. To begin with, 43% of lone wolf terrorism is motivated by religious beliefs. The same report indicates that just less than a third (31.9%) have pre-existing mental health disorders, while many more are found to have these problems upon arrest. At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26.1% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases. 40.2% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event. 19.3% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others, while 14.3% experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault. \nAttacks on 'collaborators' are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control. This strategy was used in Ireland, in Kenya, in Algeria and in Cyprus during their independence struggles. \n\nThis strategy was used by Al-Qaeda in its attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States on September 11, 2001. These attacks are also used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported, such as the Palestinian airplane hijackings in 1970 and the 1975 Dutch train hostage crisis.\n\nAbrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness. Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives, which are often murky and undefined.\n\nAdditionally, Michael Mousseau shows possible relationships between the type of economy within a country and ideology associated with terrorism. Many terrorists have a history of domestic violence.\n\nSome terrorists like Timothy McVeigh were motivated by revenge against a state for its actions against its citizens.\n\nAccording to Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert on behalf of The Department of security of UK, 43% of lone wolf terrorism is motivated by religious beliefs. The same report indicates that Just less than a third (31.9%) have pre-existing mental health disorders, while many are found to have these problems upon arrest. At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26.1% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases. 40.2% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event. Many were chronically unemployed and consistently struggled to hold any form of employment for a significant amount of time. 19.3% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others, while 14.3% experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault. \nAriel Merari, a psychologist who has studied the psychological profiles of suicide terrorists since 1983 through media reports that contained biographical details, interviews with the suicides’ families, and interviews with jailed would-be suicide attackers, concluded that they were unlikely to be psychologically abnormal.\n\nIn comparison to economic theories of criminal behaviour, Scott Atran found that suicide terrorists exhibit none of the socially dysfunctional attributes - such as fatherless, friendless, jobless situations - or suicidal symptoms. By which he means, they do not kill themselves simply out of hopelessness or a sense of 'having nothing to lose'.\n\nAlthough a common factor in terrorism is a strong religious belief there are other factors such as cultural, social and \npolitical that wholly preclude religion. For example, the drive behind these Chechen terrorists are quite distinct and unique from others. Many of the Chechens considered themselves secular freedom fighters, nationalist insurgents seeking to establish an independent secular state of Chechnya. Although a distinction should be made between national Chechen terrorists and non-Chechen fighters who have adopted the idea from abroad. Few Chechen fighters fought for the jihads whereas most of the non-Chechen fighters did (Janeczko, 2014)\nAnother factor are perceived assurances of financial stability for the actor's families, that they are given when they join a terrorist organization or complete an attempt of terror. An extra grant is provided for the families of suicide bombers.\n\nTerrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom, and it is least common in the most democratic nations.\nHowever, one study suggests that suicide attacks may be an exception to this general rule. Evidence regarding this particular method of terrorism reveals that every modern suicide campaign has targeted a democracy–a state with a considerable degree of political freedom. The study suggests that concessions awarded to terrorists during the 1980s and 1990s for suicide attacks increased their frequency. There is a connection between the existence of civil liberties, democratic participation and terrorism. According to Young and Dugan, these things encourage terrorist groups to organize and generate terror.\n\nSome examples of \"terrorism\" in non-democratic nations include ETA in Spain under Francisco Franco (although the group's terrorist activities increased sharply after Franco's death), the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in pre-war Poland, the Shining Path in Peru under Alberto Fujimori, the Kurdistan Workers Party when Turkey was ruled by military leaders and the ANC in South Africa. Democracies, such as Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Israel, Indonesia, India, Spain, Germany, Italy and the Philippines, have also experienced domestic terrorism.\n\nWhile a democratic nation espousing civil liberties may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes, an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma: whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem; or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties. For this reason, homegrown terrorism has started to be seen as a greater threat, as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden. This dilemma, some social theorists would conclude, may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist(s); namely, to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system.\n\nTerrorist acts throughout history have been performed on religious grounds with the goal to either spread or enforce a system of belief, viewpoint or opinion. The validity and scope of religious terrorism is limited to an individual's view or a group's view or interpretation of that belief system's teachings.\n\nAccording to the Global Terrorism Index by the University of Maryland, College Park, religious extremism has overtaken national separatism and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world. Since 9/11 there has been a five-fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks. The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda. Before 2000, it was nationalist separatist terrorist organizations such as the IRA and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks. The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown. The prevalence of Islamist groups in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria is the main driver behind these trends.\n\nFour of the terrorist groups that have been most active since 2001 are Boko Haram, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and ISIL. These groups have been most active in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. 80% of all deaths from terrorism occurred in one of these five countries.\n\nTerrorism in Pakistan has become a great problem. From the summer of 2007 until late 2009, more than 1,500 people were killed in suicide and other attacks on civilians for reasons attributed to a number of causes – sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims; easy availability of guns and explosives; the existence of a \"Kalashnikov culture\"; an influx of ideologically driven Muslims based in or near Pakistan, who originated from various nations around the world and the subsequent war against the pro-Soviet Afghans in the 1980s which blew back into Pakistan; the presence of Islamist insurgent groups and forces such as the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba. Pakistan is the 10th most dangerous country by criminality index. On July 2, 2013 in Lahore, 50 Muslim scholars of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) issued a collective fatwa against suicide bombings, the killing of innocent people, bomb attacks, and targeted killings declaring them as Haraam or forbidden.\n\nIn 2015, the Southern Poverty Law Center released a report on terrorism in the United States. The report (titled \"The Age of the Wolf\") found that during that period, \"more people have been killed in America by non-Islamic domestic terrorists than jihadists.\" The \"virulent racist and anti-semitic\" ideology of the ultra-right wing Christian Identity movement is usually accompanied by anti-government sentiments. Adherents of Christian Identity believe that whites of European descent can be traced back to the \"Lost Tribes of Israel\" and many consider Jews to be the Satanic offspring of Eve and the Serpent. This group has committed hate crimes, bombings and other acts of terrorism. Its influence ranges from the Ku Klux Klan and neo-nazi groups to the anti-government militia and sovereign citizen movements. Christian Identity's origins can be traced back to Anglo-Israelism. Anglo-Israelism held the view that Jews were descendants of ancient Israelites who had never been lost. By the 1930s, the movement had been infected with anti-Semitism, and eventually Christian Identity theology diverged from traditional Anglo-Israelism, and developed what is known as the \"two seed\" theory. According to the two-seed theory, the Jewish people are descended from Cain and the serpent (not from Shem). The white European seedline is descended from the \"lost tribes\" of Israel. They hold themselves to \"God's laws\", not to \"man's laws\", and they do not feel bound to a government that they consider run by Jews and the New World Order.\nIsrael has also had problems with Jewish religious terrorism. Yigal Amir assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. For Amir, killing Rabin was an exemplary act that symbolized the fight against an illegitimate government that was prepared to cede Jewish Holy Land to the Palestinians. \n\nThe perpetrators of acts of terrorism can be individuals, groups, or states. According to some definitions, clandestine or semi-clandestine state actors may also carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war. However, the most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive cells, highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times, such as the September 11 attacks, the London underground bombing, 2008 Mumbai attacks and the 2002 Bali bombing were planned and carried out by a close clique, composed of close friends, family members and other strong social networks. These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient telecommunications to succeed where others had failed.\n\nOver the years, much research has been conducted to distill a terrorist profile to explain these individuals' actions through their psychology and socio-economic circumstances. Others, like Roderick Hindery, have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists. Some security organizations designate these groups as \"violent non-state actors\". A 2007 study by economist Alan B. Krueger found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background (28% vs. 33%) and more likely to have at least a high-school education (47% vs. 38%). Another analysis found only 16% of terrorists came from impoverished families, vs. 30% of male Palestinians, and over 60% had gone beyond high school, vs. 15% of the populace.A study into the poverty-stricken conditions and whether or not,terrorists are more likely to come from here,show that people who grew up in these situations tend to show aggression and frustration towards others. This theory is largely debated for the simple fact that just because one is frustrated,does not make them a potential terrorist.\n\nTo avoid detection, a terrorist will look, dress, and behave normally until executing the assigned mission. Some claim that attempts to profile terrorists based on personality, physical, or sociological traits are not useful. The physical and behavioral description of the terrorist could describe almost any normal person. However, the majority of terrorist attacks are carried out by military age men, aged 16–40.\n\nGroups not part of the state apparatus of in opposition to the state are most commonly referred to as a \"terrorist\" in the media.\n\nAccording to the Global Terrorism Database, the most active terrorist group in the period 1970 to 2010 was Shining Path (with 4,517 attacks), followed by Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), Irish Republican Army (IRA), Basque Fatherland and Freedom (ETA), Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Taliban, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, New People's Army, National Liberation Army of Colombia (ELN), and Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).\n\nA state can sponsor terrorism by funding or harboring a terrorist group. Opinions as to which acts of violence by states consist of state-sponsored terrorism vary widely. When states provide funding for groups considered by some to be terrorist, they rarely acknowledge them as such.\n\nAs with \"terrorism\" the concept of \"state terrorism\" is controversial. The Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the Committee was conscious of 12 international Conventions on the subject, and none of them referred to State terrorism, which was not an international legal concept. If States abused their power, they should be judged against international conventions dealing with war crimes, international human rights law, and international humanitarian law. Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that it is \"time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'. The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law\". However, he also made clear that, \"regardless of the differences between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is that any deliberate attack on innocent civilians [or non-combatants], regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism.\"\nState terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts committed by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of Political Science Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German bombing of London, the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, the British and American firebombing of Dresden, and the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. He argues that \"the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents.\" He also cites the first strike option as an example of the \"terror of coercive diplomacy\" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using nuclear weapons in \"crisis management\" and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II. In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction, and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state .\n\nThe connection between terrorism and tourism has been widely studied since the Luxor massacre in Egypt. In the 1970s, the targets of terrorists were politicians and chiefs of police while now, international tourists and visitors are selected as the main targets of attacks. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, were the symbolic epicenter, which marked a new epoch in the use of civil transport against the main power of the planet. From this event onwards, the spaces of leisure that characterized the pride of West, were conceived as dangerous and frightful.\n\nState sponsors have constituted a major form of funding; for example, Palestine Liberation Organization, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and other groups considered to be terrorist organizations, were funded by the Soviet Union. The Stern Gang received funding from Italian Fascist officers in Beirut to undermine the British Mandate for Palestine. Pakistan has created and nurtured terrorist groups as policy for achieving tactical objectives against its neighbours, especially India.\n\n\"Revolutionary tax\" is another major form of funding, and essentially a euphemism for \"protection money\". Revolutionary taxes \"play a secondary role as one other means of intimidating the target population\".\n\nOther major sources of funding include kidnapping for ransoms, smuggling (including wildlife smuggling), fraud, and robbery. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant has reportedly received funding \"via private donations from the Gulf states\".\n\nThe Financial Action Task Force is an inter-governmental body whose mandate, since October 2001, has included combating terrorist financing.\n\nTerrorist attacks are often targeted to maximize fear and publicity, usually using explosives or poison.\nTerrorist groups usually methodically plan attacks in advance, and may train participants, plant undercover agents, and raise money from supporters or through organized crime. Communications occur through modern telecommunications, or through old-fashioned methods such as couriers. There is also concern about terrorist attacks employing weapons of mass destruction.\n\nTerrorism is a form of asymmetric warfare, and is more common when direct conventional warfare will not be effective because forces vary greatly in power.\n\nThe context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale, unresolved political conflict. The type of conflict varies widely; historical examples include:\n\nResponses to terrorism are broad in scope. They can include re-alignments of the political spectrum and reassessments of fundamental values.\n\nSpecific types of responses include:\n\nThe term \"counter-terrorism\" has a narrower connotation, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors.\n\nAccording to a report by Dana Priest and William M. Arkin in The Washington Post, \"Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States.\"\n\nAmerica's thinking on how to defeat radical Islamists is split along two very different schools of thought. Republicans, typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine, advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East. Democrats, by contrast, generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home. In the introduction of the \"U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual\", Sarah Sewall states the need for \"U.S. forces to make securing the civilian, rather than destroying the enemy, their top priority. The civilian population is the center of gravity—the deciding factor in the struggle... Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemies—new insurgent recruits or informants––and erode support of the host nation.\" Sewall sums up the book's key points on how to win this battle: \"Sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be... Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is... The more successful the counterinsurgency is, the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted... Sometimes, doing nothing is the best reaction.\" This strategy, often termed \"courageous restraint\", has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield, yet it fails to address the central truth: the terrorists we face are mostly homegrown.\n\nTerrorism research, also called terrorism and counter-terrorism research, is an interdisciplinary academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism, how to prevent it as well as its impact in the broadest sense. Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts, for example by research centres such as the British Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, and the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT). There are several academic journals devoted to the field.\n\nOne of the agreements that promote the international legal anti-terror framework is the Code of Conduct Towards Achieving a World Free of Terrorism that was adopted at the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2018. The Code of Conduct was initiated by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Its main goal is to implement a wide range of international commitments to counter terrorism and establish a broad global coalition towards achieving a world free of terrorism by 2045. The Code was signed by more than 70 countries.\n\nMass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media. Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media.\n\nThe Internet has created a new channel for groups to spread their messages. This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements. The United Nations has created its own online counter-terrorism resource.\n\nThe mass media will, on occasion, censor organizations involved in terrorism (through self-restraint or regulation) to discourage further terrorism. However, this may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media. Conversely James F. Pastor explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media, and the underlying benefit each receives from the other.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher also famously spoke of the close connection between terrorism and the media, calling publicity 'the oxygen of terrorism'.\n\nJones and Libicki (2008) created a list of all the terrorist groups they could find that were active between 1968 and 2006. They found 648. of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006. Of the ones that ended, 43 percent converted to nonviolent political actions, like the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland. Law enforcement took out 40 percent. Ten percent won. Only 20 groups, 7 percent, were taken out by military force.\n\nForty-two groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency; 38 of those had ended by 2006. Of those, 47 percent converted to nonviolent political actors. Only 5 percent were taken out by law enforcement. 26 percent won. 21 percent succumbed to military force. Jones and Libicki concluded that military force may be necessary to deal with large insurgencies but are only occasionally decisive, because the military is too often seen as a bigger threat to civilians than the terrorists. To avoid that, the rules of engagement must be conscious of collateral damage and work to minimize it.\n\nAnother researcher, Audrey Cronin, lists six primary ways that terrorist groups end:\n\nThe following terrorism databases are or were made publicly available for research purposes, and track specific acts of terrorism:\nThe following public report and index provides a summary of key global trends and patterns in terrorism around the world\nThe following publicly available resources index electronic and bibliographic resources on the subject of terrorism\n\nThe following terrorism databases are maintained in secrecy by the United States Government for intelligence and counter-terrorism purposes:\n\nJones and Libicki (2008) includes a table of 268 terrorist groups active between 1968 and 2006 with their status as of 2006: still active, splintered, converted to nonviolence, removed by law enforcement or military, or won. (These data are not in a convenient machine-readable format but are available.)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21689407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21689407", "title": "War over Water (Jordan river)", "text": "War over Water (Jordan river)\n\nThe \"War over Water\", also the Battle over Water, refers to a series of confrontations between Israel and its Arab neighbors from November 1964 to May 1967 over control of water sources in the Jordan River drainage basin.\n\nThe 1949 Armistice Agreements which followed the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, created three demilitarized zones on the Israel-Syria border. The southernmost, and also the largest, stretched from the south-eastern part of the Sea of Galilee eastwards to the Yarmuk River where the borders of Israel, Jordan and Syria converge. The issue of water sharing from the Jordan–Yarmuk system turned out to be a major problem between Israel, Syria and Jordan.\n\nSmall scale water-related skirmishes had occurred following the 1949 agreements. In July 1953, Israel began construction of an intake for its National Water Carrier at the Daughters of Jacob Jordan Bridge in the demilitarized zone north of the Sea of Galilee. Syrian artillery units opened fire on the construction site. The United Nations security council majority (excepting the USSR) voted for the resumption of work by Israel. The Israelis then moved the intake to an economically inferior site at the Sea of Galilee.\n\nIn 1955 the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan (Johnston Plan) was accepted by the technical committees of both Israel and the Arab League, but the Arab League Council decided not to ratify the plan on 11 October 1955. According to most observers, including Johnston himself, the Arab non-adoption of the plan was not total rejection. While they failed to approve it politically, they nevertheless seemed determined to adhere to the technical details of the agreement. Moreover, it continued to be taken seriously by Arab leaders. Though the Unified Plan failed to be ratified, both Jordan and Israel undertook to operate within their allocation limits.\n\nIsrael completed its National Water Carrier project, which siphoned water from the Sea of Galilee in 1964. The initial diversion capacity of the National Water Carrier, without supplementary booster pumps, was 320 million m, well within the limits of the Johnston Plan. \nNevertheless, the Arab states were not prepared to coexist with a project which seemed likely to make a major contribution to Israel's economic growth. In January 1964 an Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo and decided:\n\nThe Arab states decided to deprive Israel of 35% of the National Water Carrier capacity, by a diversion of the Jordan River headwaters (both the Hasbani and the Banias) to the Yarmouk River. The scheme was only marginally feasible, as it was technically difficult and expensive.\n\nA major escalation took place in 1964 when Israel declared it would regard the Diversion Project as an infringement on its sovereign rights.\nIn 1965, there were three notable border clashes, starting with Syrian shootings of Israeli farmers and army patrols, followed by Israeli tanks and artillery destroying the Arab heavy earth moving machines that were used for the diversion plan. The Arab countries eventually abandoned their project. Control of water resources and Israeli military attacks against the diversion effort are considered among the factors which led to the Six-Day War in June 1967.\n\nThe war is referenced in the famous US antiwar 1965 song \"Eve of Destruction\" by Barry McGuire with the line \"And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'\".\n\n\n"}

When he was six years old an accident to his foot incapacitated him for ten years, and he developed habits of continuous and concentrated study. His parents were ardent partisans of the House of Orange-Nassau, and Bilderdijk grew up with strong monarchical and Calvinistic convictions.\n\nAfter studying at Leiden University, Bilderdijk obtained his doctorate in law in 1782, and began to practise as an advocate at The Hague. Three years later he contracted an unhappy marriage with Rebecca Woesthoven. He refused in 1795 to take the oath to the administration of the new Batavian Republic, and was consequently obliged to leave the Netherlands. He went to Hamburg, and then to London, where his great learning procured him consideration.\n\nThere he had as a pupil (1776-1830), the daughter of the Dutch painter Heinrich Wilhelm Schweickhardt and herself a poet. When he left London in June 1797 for Braunschweig, this lady followed him, and after he had formally divorced his first wife (1802) they were married.\n\nIn 1806 he was persuaded by his friends to return to the Netherlands, where the Batavian Republic had been replaced by a monarchy, the first king being Louis Bonaparte, a brother of the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Louis Napoleon kindly received Bilderdijk and made him his librarian, and a member and eventually president (1809–1811) of the Royal Institute. \nBilderdijk also taught the king Dutch, although -on one occasion- he told his people that he was the \"Konijn van 'Olland\" (\"rabbit of 'Olland\"), rather than \"Koning van Holland\" (\"King of Holland\"), because he had difficulty mastering the pronunciation.\n\nAfter the abdication of Louis Napoleon Bilderdijk suffered great poverty; on the accession of William I of the Netherlands in 1813 he hoped to be made a professor, but was disappointed and became a history tutor at Leiden. He continued his vigorous campaign against liberal ideas to his death, which took place at Haarlem on 18 December 1831.\n\nBilderdijk was the founder of the spiritual movement that is called \"Het Réveil\", which tried to give a Christian answer to the ideals of the French Revolution. Among his disciples were Abraham Capadose, Willem de Clercq, Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer, and especially Isaac da Costa, who called his teacher \"anti-revolutionary, anti-Barneveldtian, anti-Loevesteinish, anti-liberal\".\n\nAccording to Godfried Bomans, who named a club after his pseudonym \"Teisterbant\", the bed Bilderdijk died in was kept until 1950 as a curiosity for people to look at. A commemorative gable stone was placed on the top gable of his old house in 1885, and a commemorative stone is also in the St. Bavochurch.\nThere is a Bilderdijk Museum in Amsterdam.\n\n\n"}
