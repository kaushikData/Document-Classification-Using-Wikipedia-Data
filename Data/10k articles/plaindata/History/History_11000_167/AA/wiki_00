This period of time corresponds to the Early to Middle Bronze Age, characterized by the early empires in the Ancient Near East. In Ancient Egypt, the Early Dynastic Period is followed by the Old Kingdom. In Mesopotamia, the Early Dynastic Period is followed by the Akkadian Empire.\n\nWorld population growth relaxes after the burst due to the Neolithic Revolution. \nWorld population is largely stable, at roughly 60 million, with a slow overall growth rate at roughly 0.03% p.a.\n\nThe Bronze Age occurred roughly between 3000 BC and 2500 BC. The previous millennium had seen the emergence of advanced, urbanized civilizations, new bronze metallurgy extending the productivity of agricultural work, and highly developed ways of communication in the form of writing. In the 3rd millennium BC, the growth of these riches, both intellectually and physically, became a source of contention on a political stage, and rulers sought the accumulation of more wealth and more power. Along with this came the first appearances of mega architecture, imperialism, organized absolutism and internal revolution.\n\nThe civilizations of Sumer and Akkad in Mesopotamia became a collection of volatile city-states in which warfare was common. Uninterrupted conflicts drained all available resources, energies and populations. In this millennium, larger empires succeeded the last, and conquerors grew in stature until the great Sargon of Akkad pushed his empire to the whole of Mesopotamia and beyond. It would not be surpassed in size until Assyrian times 1,500 years later.\n\nIn the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the Egyptian pyramids were constructed and would remain the tallest and largest human constructions for thousands of years. Also in Egypt, pharaohs began to posture themselves as living gods made of an essence different from that of other human beings. Even in Europe, which was still largely neolithic during the same period, the builders of megaliths were constructing giant monuments of their own. In the Near East and the Occident during the 3rd millennium BC, limits were being pushed by architects and rulers.\n\nTowards the close of the millennium, Egypt became the stage of the first popular revolution recorded in history. After lengthy wars, the Sumerians recognized the benefits of unification into a stable form of national government and became a relatively peaceful, well-organized, complex technocratic state called the 3rd dynasty of Ur. This dynasty was later to become involved with a wave of nomadic invaders known as the Amorites, who were to play a major role in the region during the following centuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain 4th millennium BC events were precursors to the 3rd millennium BC:\nThe 3rd millennium BC included the following key events:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "493609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=493609", "title": "Chasuble", "text": "Chasuble\n\nThe chasuble () is the outermost liturgical vestment worn by clergy for the celebration of the Eucharist in Western-tradition Christian churches that use full vestments, primarily in Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches. In the Eastern Orthodox Churches and in the Eastern Catholic Churches, the equivalent vestment is the phelonion.\n\n\"The vestment proper to the priest celebrant at Mass and other sacred actions directly connected with Mass is, unless otherwise indicated, the chasuble, worn over the alb and stole\" (\"General Instruction of the Roman Missal\", 337). Like the stole, it is normally of the liturgical colour of the Mass being celebrated.\n\nThe chasuble originated as a sort of conical poncho, called in Latin a or \"little house\", that was the common outer traveling garment in the late Roman Empire. It was simply a roughly oval piece of cloth, with a round hole in the middle through which to pass the head, that fell below the knees on all sides. It had to be gathered up on the arms to allow the arms to be used freely.\n\nIn its liturgical use in the West, this garment was folded up from the sides to leave the hands free. Strings were sometimes used to assist in this task, and the deacon could help the priest in folding up the sides of the vestment. Beginning in the 13th century, there was a tendency to shorten the sides a little. In the course of the 15th and the following century, the chasuble took something like its modern form, in which the sides of the vestment no longer reach to the ankle but only, at most, to the wrist, making folding unnecessary.\n\nAt the end of the sixteenth century the chasuble, though still quite ample and covering part of the arms, had become less similar to its traditional shape than to that which prevailed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the chasuble was reduced to a broad scapular, leaving the whole of the arms quite free, and was shortened also in front and back. Additionally, to make it easier for the priest to join his hands when wearing a chasuble of stiff (lined and heavily embroidered) material, in these later centuries the front was often cut away further, giving it the distinctive shape often called \"fiddleback\". Complex decoration schemes were often used on chasubles of scapular form, especially the back, incorporating the image of the Christian cross or of a saint; and rich materials such as silk, cloth of gold or brocade were employed, especially in chasubles reserved for major celebrations.\n\nIn the 20th century, there began to be a return to an earlier, more ample, form of the chasuble, sometimes called \"Gothic\", as distinguished from the \"Roman\" scapular form. This aroused some opposition, as a result of which the Sacred Congregation of Rites issued on 9 December 1925 a decree against it,\"De forma paramentorum\" which it explicitly revoked with the declaration \"Circa dubium de forma paramentorum\" of 20 August 1957, leaving the matter to the prudent judgement of local Ordinaries. There exists a photograph of Pope Pius XI wearing the more ample chasuble while celebrating Mass in Saint Peter's Basilica as early as 19 March 1930.\n\nAfter the Second Vatican Council, the more ample form became the most usually seen form of the chasuble, and the directions of the GIRM quoted above indicate that \"it is fitting\" that the beauty should come \"not from abundance of overly lavish ornamentation, but rather from the material that is used and from the design. Ornamentation on vestments should, moreover, consist of figures, that is, of images or symbols, that evoke sacred use, avoiding thereby anything unbecoming\" (n. 344). Hence, the prevalence today of chasubles that reach almost to the ankles, and to the wrists, and decorated with relatively simple symbols or bands and orphreys. By comparison, \"fiddleback\" vestments were often extremely heavily embroidered or painted with detailed decorations or whole scenes depicted.\n\nUse of scapular \"Roman\" chasubles, whether with straight edges or in \"fiddleback\" form, is sometimes associated with traditionalism. However, some priests prefer them simply on grounds of taste and comfort, while for similar reasons some traditionalist priests prefer ampler chasubles of less stiff material.\n\nPope Benedict XVI sometimes used chasubles of the transitional style common at the end of the 16th century.\n\nIn the Slavic tradition, though not in the Greek, the phelonion, the Byzantine Rite vestment that corresponds to the chasuble, is cut away from the front and not from the sides, making it look somewhat like the western cope.\n\nMany, but not all, Lutheran and Anglican churches make use of the chasuble. \n\nThe chasuble has always been used by the Lutheran denominations of Scandinavia, which also practise weekly Communion. German Lutherans, who also practise weekly Communion, used it for the first two hundred years after the Reformation but later replaced it with the Geneva Gown. A variety of practices emerged in North America but by the mid-20th century, the alb and stole became widely customary. More recently, the chasuble has been readopted for Communion services in both Germany and North America.\n\nIt is the stole, not the chasuble, that is the priestly vestment. \nThe chasuble was never used by low-church Anglicans and rarely used by high-church Anglicans until the Oxford Movement in the 19th century, and even then not until the second generation of the Oxford Movement.\n\nIt is not customary and rarely seen in Protestantism outside of the liturgical churches.\n\nIn Oscar Wilde's 1895 play \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", Dr. Chasuble is a clergyman who, in the 2002 film adaptation, is seen wearing his namesake vestment.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30871305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30871305", "title": "Clement of Ohrid", "text": "Clement of Ohrid\n\nSaint Clement of Ohrid (Bulgarian, Macedonian: Свети Климент Охридски, , , Slovak: svätý Kliment Ochridský / Sloviensky) (ca. 840 – 916) was a medieval Bulgarian saint, scholar, writer and enlightener of the Slavs. He was one of the most prominent disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius and is often associated with the creation of the Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts, especially their popularisation among Christianised Slavs. He was the founder of the Ohrid Literary School and is regarded as a patron of education and language by some Slavic people. He is considered to be the first bishop of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, one of the seven Apostles of the Bulgarian Empire and one of the premier saints of modern Bulgaria. Saint Clement is also the patron saint of the Republic of Macedonia, the city of Ohrid and the Macedonian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe exact date of his birth is unknown. Most probably, he joined Methodius as a young man following him later to the monastery on Mysian Olympus. According to his hagiography by Theophylact of Ohrid, Clement knew the life of Methodius like no other. That is why most scholars think he was born in the Byzantine Empire in the territory where Methodius served during his political career, i.e. that he was a Slav from Southern Macedonia. According to others, the area of Southern Macedonia, where he was born, was then part of Bulgaria. Most of Macedonia became part of Bulgaria in 830s and in 840s, i.e when Clement was born. The \"Short Life of St. Clement\" by Theophylact of Ohrid testifies to his Slavic origin, calling him \"the first bishop in the Bulgarian language,\" while \"The Ohrid Legend\" written by Demetrios Chomatenos calls him a Bulgarian, who was born somewhere in Macedonia. Because of that, some scholars label him a Bulgarian Slav, while Dimitri Obolensky calls Clement a Slav inhabitant of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. A fringe view on his origin postulates that Clement was born in Great Moravia. This view is based on the lexicographical analysis of Clement's works.\n\nClement participated in the mission of Cyril and Methodius to Great Moravia. In 867 or 868 he became a priest in Rome, ordained along with two other disciples of Cyril and Methodius, Saint Gorazd and Saint Naum, by bishops Formosus and Gauderic. After the death of Cyril, Clement accompanied Methodius on his journey from Rome to Pannonia and Great Moravia. After the death of Methodius himself in 885, Clement headed the struggle against the German clergy in Great Moravia along with Gorazd. After spending some time in jail, he was expelled from Great Moravia and in 885 or 886 reached Belgrade, then in the borders of Bulgaria together with Naum of Preslav, Angelarius and possibly Gorazd (according to other sources, Gorazd was already dead by that time). Thereafter, the four of them were sent to the Bulgarian capital of Pliska where they were commissioned by Boris I of Bulgaria to instruct the future clergy of the state in the Slavonic language.\n\nAfter the adoption of Christianity in 865, religious ceremonies in Bulgaria were conducted in Greek by clergy sent from the Byzantine Empire. Fearing growing Byzantine influence and weakening of the state, Boris viewed the adoption of the Old Slavonic language as a way to preserve the political independence and stability of Bulgaria. With a view thereto, Boris made arrangements for the establishment of two literary academies where theology was to be taught in the Slavonic language. The first of the schools was to be founded in the capital, Pliska, and the second in the region of Kutmichevitsa.\n\nAccording to his hagiography by Theophylact of Ohrid, while Naum stayed in Pliska working on the foundation of the Pliska Literary School, Clement was commissioned by Boris I to organise the teaching of theology to future clergymen in Old Church Slavonic in the southwestern part of the Bulgarian Empire, in the region then known as Kutmichevitsa. For a period of seven years (between 886 and 893) Clement taught some 3,500 disciples in the Slavonic language and the Glagolitic alphabet. At that time, Clement translated Christian literature into Old Church Slavonic, and in this way, he and his co-workers laid the foundations of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. In 893 he was ordained archbishop of Drembica, Velika (bishopric). Upon his death in 916 he was buried in his monastery, Saint Panteleimon, in Ohrid. Soon after he was canonized as a saint by the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. \n\nThe development of Old Church Slavonic literacy had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the South Slavs into neighbouring Byzantine culture, which promoted the formation of a distinct Bulgarian identity in the Empire. During the first quarter of the 10th century, the ethnonym “Bulgarians” was adopted by the Slavic tribes in most of Macedonia, while their names were abandoned. Clement's life's work played a significant role in this transformation.\n\nSaint Clement of Ohrid was one of the most prolific and important writers in Old Church Slavonic. He is credited with the \"Panonic Hagiography of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius\". Clement also translated the \"Flower Triode\" containing church songs sung from Easter to Pentecost and is believed to be the author of the \"Holy Service\" and the \"Life of St. Clement of Rome\", as well as of the oldest service dedicated to St. Cyril and St. Methodius. The invention of the Cyrillic alphabet is also usually ascribed to him although the alphabet is most likely to have been developed at the Preslav Literary School at the beginning of the 10th century (see Cyrillic script).\n\nThe first modern Bulgarian university, Sofia University, was named after Clement upon its foundation in 1888. The Macedonian National and University Library, founded on November 23, 1944, also bears his name. The University in Bitola (Republic of Macedonia), established in 1979, is named after Clement, as well as the Bulgarian scientific base, St. Kliment Ohridski on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica.\n\nIn November 2008, the Macedonian Orthodox Church donated part of Clement's relics to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as a sign of good will.\n\nIn May 2018 was announced that in the ruins of a medieval monastery near the village of Ravna in Provadiya Municipality, the signature of Saint Clement was identified on a stone plate with a large amount of graffiti on it. The signature is dated as of April 24, 889. The finding gives reason to assume that the disciples of Saint Cyril and Methodius were settled here, initially after their reception in Bulgaria.\n\n"}
{"id": "14049180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14049180", "title": "Duke's Company", "text": "Duke's Company\n\nThe Duke's Company was a theatre company chartered by King Charles II at the start of the Restoration era, 1660. Sir William Davenant was manager of the company under Prince James, Duke of York's patronage. During this period, theatres began to flourish again after being closed due to restrictions throughout the Interregnum and English Civil War.\n\nThe Duke's Company was one of the two theatre companies (the other being the King's Company) that were chartered by King Charles II at the start of the English Restoration era, when the London theatres re-opened after their eighteen-year closure (1642–60) during the English Civil War and the Interregnum.\n\nThe Duke's Company had the patronage of the King's younger brother Prince James, Duke of York and of Albany (later King James II & VII). It was managed by Sir William Davenant. The company started at the old Salisbury Court Theatre, and occasionally used the Cockpit in Drury Lane. After a year, the actors moved to a new theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, a building on Portugal Street that had previously been Lisle's Tennis Court (it opened on 18 June 1661). There they were joined by Thomas Betterton, who quickly became their star. In December 1660, the King granted the Duke's Company the exclusive rights to ten of Shakespeare's plays: \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\", \"King Lear\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"The Tempest\", \"Twelfth Night\", \"Much Ado About Nothing\", \"Measure for Measure\", \"Henry VIII\", and \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\". In 1661, their first year at Lincoln's Inn Fields, the company revived \"Hamlet\", in a production that employed the innovation of stage scenery. Samuel Pepys saw their production on 24 August; he described it as \"done with scenes very well, but above all, Betterton did the Prince's part beyond imagination\".\n\nDavenant tried to make the most of the limited Shakespearean materials available to him. In 1662 he staged \"The Law Against Lovers\", a heavily adapted version of \"Measure for Measure\" that blended in characters from \"Much Ado About Nothing\". It was the earliest of the many Shakespearean adaptations produced during the Restoration era and the eighteenth century.\n\nThe company also acted some of the plays in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. Yet the rival King's Company under Thomas Killigrew controlled more of the \"Old Stock Plays\", the traditional repertory of English Renaissance drama (Davenant even had to petition for the right to perform his own pre-1642 plays). The Duke's Company was driven to seek out new work by a new generation of writers, and to experiment with new forms and styles. The company performed the plays of Davenant, John Dryden, Thomas Otway, George Etheredge, Thomas Shadwell and others; it produced Aphra Behn's plays from 1670 to 1682. The company also acted many translations and adaptations of French and other foreign plays; their 1662 production of Sir Samuel Tuke's \"The Adventures of Five Hours\", a version of Calderón's comedy \"Los Empeños de Seis Horas\", ran for thirteen straight performances and was the first great hit of Restoration drama.\n\nLike the King's Company, the Duke's pioneered the use of the first English actresses in the early 1660s. Their standout performer was Mary Saunderson, later Mrs. Betterton, who acted many of the lead female roles in Shakespeare's plays. Anne Gibbs (later married to Thomas Shadwell) and Mary Lee also had noteworthy careers.\n\nSamuel Pepys saw many of their productions, and recorded them in his Diary. King Charles witnessed many of their productions too; in a break with past practice, the King sometimes came to the theatre to see the plays, which in previous reigns had never happened. (Instead, the acting companies had always gone to Court to perform.) In its busiest seasons, the company staged fifty different plays in a year, ten of them new works.\n\nAfter Davenant's death in April 1668, Betterton took command of the company, in collaboration with Davenant's widow Lady Mary Davenant. Their management team expanded its strategies to ensure success: the company engaged in three consecutive (and profitable) summer seasons in Oxford starting in 1669. On 9 November 1671 the company moved into a new theatre in Dorset Garden, sometimes called the Queen's Theatre, \"the most elegant of all the Restoration playhouses...\". The Duke's Company exploited the scenic capacities of the Dorset Garden Theatre to produce many of the Restoration spectaculars and the early operas and semi-operas that characterized the Restoration era. The most successful of the company's semi-operas was the Dryden/ Davenant adaptation of \"The Tempest\", which premiered on 7 November 1667. From 1675 on, Elizabeth Barry acted with the Duke's Company and became recognized as one of the stars of the era.\n\nBoth the Duke's and King's Companies suffered poor attendance during the turmoil of the Popish Plot period, 1678–81. When the King's Company fell into difficulties due to mismanagement, the Duke's Company joined with them to form the United Company in 1682, under the Duke's Company's management. The United Company began performances in November of that year. The King's Company theatre, the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, was used mainly for plays, while the Duke's Dorset Garden theatre was devoted to operas and spectaculars.\n\nJohn Downes was the prompter of the Duke's Company from 1662 to 1706. In 1708 he published his \"Roscius Anglicanus\", the \"main source of information about the Restoration theatre\" for later generations.\n\nSir William Davenant was the first manager for the Duke's Company. Moreover, he was the patent holder and fundamentally the creator of the theatre group. After Killigrew had been granted his patent for the King's Company, Davenant drafted a document to give him and Killigrew duel monopoly over the theatre companies. Davenant could do this because he was rewarded with a warrant from Charles I during 1639 to build his own theatre, which whilst defunct still added gravitas to his claims. Furthermore, his masque work with Charles I, also being the writer for the two operas performed during the Puritan regime certainly cemented him as an accomplished and reliable manager to the second company. Thus the Duke's company was created.\n\nDavenant, with a background in masque, grew to believe that spectacle was the way forward for British theatre. Mary Edmond comments that he \"realised very early on that play goers would soon be demanding scenic theatres\". Thus he went forward with creating theatre spaces that used changeable scenes, as well as always updating these scenes to make performances feel fresh and new for the audiences. During his time as manager he set the standard for the Duke's company. After being lumbered with only 23 plays in comparison to the King's 108, Davenant turned his company in the direction of new writing and adaptations of pre-restoration work that he did have. He worked with writers such as George Etheredge, John Dryden and Roger Boyle.\n\nNot only did he attempt to keep the work performed for the Duke's men modern, he also had plans to keep the theatres as functional and of the highest quality. This new and exciting theatre manifested as Dorset Garden. Whilst this was not created until after his death, he managed to fund the project. He did this by selling 7 7/10ths of his shares to people at a price range of £600 - £800. Then sharers then managed to raise the rest of the substantial sum of £9000 which it is roughly considered to have cost.\n\nThe theatre house was built under the next set of managers for the Duke's company. This was the collaboration of Thomas Betterton and Henry Harris under the watch of Davenant's wife. Both Betterton and Harris were star players of Davenant. They continued the legacy of the Duke's company well. The theatre house that was erected during their time as managers was state of the art, boasting machinery, something that was no doubt inspired by European theatres. Furthermore, they continued to boast new writers including Aphra Behn, Thomas Otway and once again John Dryden. Unlike Davenant, neither wrote their own work. However, unlike the King's Company, the second managers wanted to make the transition as smooth as possible. Their decisions had \"been reviewed by the board of sharing actors as well as by representatives of the Davenant family\". Thus we see that despite having recognizable influence within the company, the duo didn't want to alienate or anyone involved in the company.\n\nAs for who own the company, it doesn’t appear that there was one owner. Instead the companies were owned by shareholders who all had some say in the running of the company, and who helped with raising funds. Indeed, the main shareholder and patent holder should be considered the principal owner, which would therefore mean William Davenant would be the owner for the period of 1660 – 1668. Thereafter Lady Davenant would be considered the owner, with Betterton and Harris as the managers. William Van Lennep supports this assumption writing \"The formal structure, then, of this type of arrangement consisted of a proprietor (the largest shareholder), who was the master of the company in both theatrical and financial affairs; a small number of sharing actors, who received a proportion of the profits after the gross receipts had provided for the major expenses; and a large number of actors on salary.\"\n\nPeople joined the company by buying shares within the company, as \"the companies were a business, and shares in them were sold to raise money needed to furnish theatres, hire personnel, and produce plays\". Therefore, it is assumed that only those of a certain class could join the company.\n\nIn 1660, for the first time women were allowed to perform on the commercial stage. However, the significance of this at the time was evidently not as apparent. One can assume this because the records of this precise actress that performed is yet to be found; therefore suggesting that it was not recorded, undermining the influence of women performing in the theatre. \nAn example of one of the women that was first to perform was Mrs. Eastland. Although her name appears on the prompter of Killigrew's original actresses, \"her name appears on no dramatis personae until 1669 and she only ever played minor parts\". In addition, she only appears on the cast list in 1669; nine years after the start of the company. \nIn spite of the allowance of women in the theatre, it is evident that the patriarchal nature of the theatre was still very apparent. For men, the acting profession was a respected and successful career, however, \"no woman with serious pretentions to respectability would countenance a stage career\". But due to the nature and demands of being an actress; learning lines quickly, and needing to have a civilised etiquette meant that the company had to find women of a middle ground; this suggests the class differences, and the overall significance of men compared to women within the company.\n\nThe new theatre the Duke's Playhouse opened on 28 June 1661 in Dorset Gardens, with the spectacular The Siege of Rhodes. The new theatre encompassed new possibilities for the company to create rich and dramatic theatre. \"A small stage and proscenium arch; the scenery consisted of wings fronting pairs of large painted flats which could be moved along grooves set in the floor and flies of the stage\". This was the first public playhouse in England to use such innovation and so impacted the choice of play. The plays became spectacles; the Siege of Rhodes being a \"magnificent production\". Other productions such as Hamlet (1661), Love and Honour (1661) and The Tempest (1667) characterise the Company's restoration spectaculars and operas. Downes remarked that the adaptation of Love and Honour, originally from 1643, in 1661 was \"Richly Cloth'd\" with Bretterton robed in fine garments and the set extraordinary.\n\nThe Duke's Company were granted exclusive rights to ten Shakespearean plays; Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear, Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, Twelfth Night, Much Ado About Nothing, Measure for Measure, Henry VII and Pericles, Prince of Tyre. This, combined with the talented actors, such as Betterton, allowed the company to create adaptations of the Shakespeare's within the playhouse.\n\nWilliam Davenant, as a manager and on good terms with the King, was able to use his patency and Betterton's talents to produce performances of his own plays. Killigrew and Davenant planned to put on tragedies, comedies, plays, operas, and all other similar entertainments, setting reasonable admission charges to meet \"the great expences of scenes, musick and new decorations as have not bin formerly used\".\n\nThe King's theatre monopoly was controlled by the legislative power the Lord Chamberlain. Chamberlain had the power to censor dramatic and printed work, having patents submit work 14 days before the performance.\nThe Duke's Company found themselves subject to Chamberlain's legislation, due to the comic performer and renowned improvisor, Edward Angel. During the run of Dryden and Davenant's The Tempest, 1667-8, Lord Chamberlain issued a warrant for the arrest of the comedian Edward Angel a member of the Dukes Company. Although the reasons behind the order remain unclear, one possible explanation is that Angel had caused offence with his talent for improvisation and unscripted political satire.\n\nThe licensing act even controlled the schedule and permitted attendees. For example, on 6 February 1720 he ordered Gay's new pastoral tragedy be acted \"immediately after Hughes\" The Siege of Damascus.\n\nThomas Patrick Betterton (ca. 1635 – 28 April 1710), English Actor in Dukes Theatre Company, son of an undercook for Charles I, born in London.\n\nAs a young boy, Betterton's education is unclear, however he is described to have had a \"great propensity\" for reading, which may explain why he was bound to Sir William Davenant's publisher, John Holden, in an apprenticeship. He may have performed in Davenant's early-unlicensed plays, however unable to sustain acting as a full career due to the plays infrequency due to the uncertain status of theatre during the Interregnum (1649 - 1660). Documents link Betterton's name to working with John Rhodes, a bookseller, during this time. John Downes, a theatre prompter for Davenant's acting troupe, first documents Betterton's participation in theatre in 1659, Drury Lane. Downes accredited Betterton's talents saying; \"His voice being audible strong, full and Articulate, as in the Prime of his Acting\".\n\nOn 6 October 1660, Betterton was a part of the Kings Company led by Thomas Killigrew. However, by 5 November, he had moved to a formal sharing agreement with Davenant to constitute the Dukes Company, as he may have felt his talent was overshadowed in the Kings Company. Betterton, in the Dukes Company became one of the most famous actors of the Restoration period. He was Samuel and Elizabeth Pepys's favourite actor; \"He is called by us both, the best actor in the world.\"\n\nThe Dukes theatre, with the help of Betterton's acting, were recognized for passing on a \"traditional\" and \"correct\" way to perform older plays, such as Shakespeare. The actors in the company owned some of the repeat roles as long as they remained in the company, which meant the actors could create and sustain their interpretations of the characters. Betterton is noted today as being \"the first classical actor\".\n\nCharles Gildon quotes Betterton as saying the company were \"obliged to make [their] Study [their] business\", and even learning the parts before rehearsals to \"enter thoroughly into the Nature of the Part\". We can see here an early Stanislavskian approach to acting, where Betterton even \"kept his mind in the same temperament as his character required\".\n\nBetterton undertook the responsibility of many lead roles in both Shakespeare, such as Hamlet, and in newer plays, such as Solyman the Magnificent. He is described as versatile actor, being able to play both villainous and comedic roles, however he did not play farce. In Milhous's \"Census\" there are 180 documented appearances of Betterton in the Dukes company however the real figure is most likely higher as 128 plays are left undocumented.\n\nBetterton's most successful role in the Dukes Company was Hamlet, which he first played in the aftermath of Charles II's coronation in 1661. John Downes writes that Davenant had seen Joseph Taylor act the part before the interregnum and then taught Betterton \"in every particle of it\". The Dukes Companies reparatory system was commercially influenced to catch and shape the social mood of the time. As the Dukes Company had royal monopoly, he created a king in Hamlet to reflect the positive influence of the return of the monarchy; his Hamlet was valiant.\n\nOn 7 April 1608 Sir Davenant died, and Betterton and Augustus Harris, being elected by all parties involved in the theatre, took over as administrators until 1677 whilst the heir to the company, Charles Davenant was too inexperienced. They successfully took control and led the construction of the Dorset Garden Theatre in 1671.\n\nBetterton throughout his career travelled to France regularly to learn about the Spectaculars and foreign Operas in order to increase the Dukes repertoire. However, Bettertons role in the spectaculars remained as chief consultant as he could neither sing nor dance, but he continued performing in traditional plays.\nBetterton as a writer is never recorded to have created any original texts, however he took a key role in production adaptation and revamping old texts, which meant combining plot lines. He worked very closely with contemporary playwrights of the time such as Aphra Behn and John Dryden, and very much encouraged the development of their new works.\n\nMuch of Betterton's private life and character remains a mystery, as he did not leave behind any personal journals or records. His shadowy reputation is encouraged by Pepys description of him as \"a very sober, serious man, and studious and humble\".\nBetterton married Mary Saunderson, an actress in the Dukes theatre, on 24 December 1662. Together, they accumulated shares within the Dukes Theatre Company by re-investing their money in part-shares. They never had children of their own, however had two adopted daughters who were both trained for the theatre. There is suggestion that Betterton may have fallen ill from 16 October 1667 to 6 July 1668, as Pepys notes in his diary; \"Betterton, ill of fever- did not return for several months\".\n\n\n"}

He described his political awakening as a realization of social injustices: \"It was my vague dissatisfaction with social hierarchy, the subjection of servants and peasants, the diffuse violence of everyday life in relatively peaceful country amongst apparently gentle folk\".\n\nWeber's books and articles have been translated into several languages. He earned many accolades for his scholarship, including membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Guggenheim Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies and the Fulbright Program. His 1,300-page \"Modern History of Europe: Men, Cultures, and Societies from the Renaissance to the Present\" (1971) was described \"a phenomenal job of synthesis and interpretation that reflects Eugen's wide and deep learning,\" by his UCLA history colleague Hans Rogger. In addition to his distinguished American Awards and honors, he was awarded the Ordre des Palmes Académiques in 1977 for his contribution to French culture.\n\nHe was born the son of Sonia and Emmanuel Weber, a well-to-do industrialist. When he was ten, his parents hired a private tutor. But the tutor did not stay long. From the age of 10 Weber was already reading The Three Musketeers by Alexander Dumas, adventure novels by Karl May, poetry by Victor Hugo and Homer. He was also reading George Sand, Jules Verne and \"every cheap paperback I could afford\". At age 12, he was sent to boarding school in Herne Bay, in south-eastern England, and later to Ashville College, Harrogate.\n\nDuring World War II, he served with the British Army in Belgium, Germany and India between 1943 and 1947 rising to the rank of captain. Afterward, Weber studied history at the Sorbonne and \"Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris\" (Sciences Po) in Paris.\n\nIn 1950, Weber married Jacqueline Brument-Roth. He graduated with a BA in 1950 and an MA from the University of Cambridge in 1954. He then taught at Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1953–1954) and the University of Alberta (1954–1955) before settling in the United States, where he taught first at the University of Iowa (1955–1956) and then, until 1993 on his retirement, at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\n\nAt Cambridge University, Eugen Weber studied with the historian David Thomson. He studied for his PhD but the dissertation was refused because the outside examiner, Alfred Cobban, of the University of London, gave a negative review of his dissertation, saying it lacked sufficient archival sources.\n\nEugen Weber wrote a column titled \"LA Confidential\" for the \"Los Angeles Times\". He also wrote for several French popular newspapers and, in 1989, presented an American public television series, \"The Western Tradition\", which consisted of fifty-two lectures of 30 minutes each.\n\nWeber took a pragmatic approach to history. He once observed: \"Nothing is more concrete than history, nothing less interested in theories or in abstract ideas. The great historians have fewer ideas about history than amateurs do; they merely have a way of ordering their facts to tell their story. It isn’t theories they look for, but information, documents, and ideas about how to find and handle them.\"\n\nWeber is associated with several important academic arguments. His book: \"Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France 1870-1914\" is a classic presentation of modernization theory. Although other historians such as Henri Mendras had put forward similar theories about the modernization of the French countryside, Weber's book was amongst the first to focus on changes in the period between 1870 and 1914. Weber emphasizes that well into the 19th century few French citizens regularly spoke French, but rather regional languages or dialects such as Breton, Gascon, Basque, Catalan, Flemish, Alsatian, and Corsican. Even in French-speaking areas provincial loyalties often transcended the putative bond of the nation. Between 1870 and 1914, Weber argued, a number of new forces penetrated the previously isolated countryside. These included the judicial and school systems, the army, the church, railways, roads, and a market economy. The result was the wholesale transformation of the population from \"peasants,\" basically ignorant of the wider nation, to Frenchmen.\n\nHis book \"Apocalypses: Prophecies, Cults, and Millennial Beliefs through the Ages\" chronicles \"apocalyptic visions and prophecies from Zarathustra to yesterday . . . . beginning with the ancients of the West and the Orient and, especially . . . the Jews and earliest Christians,\" finding that \"an absolute belief in the end of time, when good would do final battle with evil, was omnipresent,\" inspiring \"Crusades, scientific discoveries, works of art, voyages such as those of Columbus, rebellions\" and reforms including American abolitionism.\n\nWeber proclaimed in \"The Western Tradition\" lectures of 1989:\n\n\"... here we are at the end of the 20th century with a lot of people lonely in a Godless world—and now they are denied not only God but the solid substance of judgment and perception\". \"The world has always been disgracefully managed but now you no longer know to whom to complain.\" \nAfter he traversed the whole spectrum of western thought, tradition, civilization, and progress in The Western Tradition, Weber pointed at some of the profound ancient lessons from the Bible and laments the fact that many people today do not read it themselves. As an agnostic, Weber viewed the Bible primarily as an important piece of historical literature, calling it: \"the epitome of wisdom, violence, high aspiration, and the hurtful achievements of mankind\". He concluded his final lecture in the Western Tradition series by praising Western man as Promethean and then with Wordsworth's poetic phrase, \"we feel that we are greater than we know.\"\n\nA 2010 biography by Stanford Franklin, \"Eugen Weber The Greatest Historian of our Times: Lessons of Greatness to the Future\" presents Weber's life and works in grandiose terms as the greatest modern historian.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26276259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26276259", "title": "HMT Empire Windrush", "text": "HMT Empire Windrush\n\nHMT \"Empire Windrush, originally MV \"Monte Rosa, was a passenger liner and cruise ship launched in Germany in 1930. She was operated as a German cruise ship under the name \"Monte Rosa\" in the 1930s, and as a German navy troopship during World War II. At the end of the war, she was acquired by the United Kingdom Government as a prize of war and renamed the \"Empire Windrush\". In British service, she continued to be used as a troopship until March 1954, when the vessel caught fire and sank in the Mediterranean Sea with the loss of four crew.\n\n\"Empire Windrush\" is best remembered today for bringing one of the first large groups of post-war West Indian immigrants to the United Kingdom, carrying 1027 passengers and two stowaways on a voyage from Jamaica to London in 1948. Of these, 802 passengers gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean of whom 693 intended to settle in the United Kingdom. British Caribbean people who came to the United Kingdom in the period after World War II are sometimes referred to as the Windrush generation.\n\n\"Empire Windrush\", under the name MV \"Monte Rosa\", was the last of five almost-identical\n\nDuring the 1920s, Hamburg Süd believed there would be a lucrative business in carrying German immigrants to South America and the first two ships (MV \"Monte Sarmiento\" and MV \"Monte Olivia\") were built for that purpose. Passenger accommodation was single-class, with space for 1150 in cabins and 1350 in dormitories. In the event, the immigrant trade never materialized and the two ships were re-purposed as cruise ships, operating in Northern European waters, the Mediterranean and around South America.\n\nThis proved to be a great success. Until then, cruise holidays had been the preserve of the rich. But by providing modestly-priced cruises, Hamburg Süd was able to profitably cater to a large new clientèle. Another ship was commissioned to cater for the demand – the MV \"Monte Cervantes\". However, she struck an uncharted rock and sank after only two years in service. Despite this, Hamburg Süd remained confident in the design and quickly ordered two more ships, the MV \"Monte Pascoal\" and the MV \"Monte Rosa\"; \"Monte Rosa\" was launched on 4 December 1930.\n\nThe five Monte-class vessels were diesel-powered motor ships, with four 1,436 nhp four-stroke diesel engines driving two propellers. At the time, the use of diesel engines was highly unusual in ships of this size, which would have been typically steam-powered. The first two to be launched \"Monte Sarmiento\" and \"Monte Olivia\" were in fact the first large diesel-powered passenger ships to see service with a German operator. The use of diesel engines reflected the experience Blohm & Voss had gained by building Diesel-powered U-boats during World War 1. The ships' top speed was (around half the speed of the large trans-Atlantic Ocean liners of the era) but this was considered adequate for both the immigrant and cruise business.\n\n\"Monte Rosa\" was long, with a beam of . She had a depth of . The ship was assessed at , .\n\n\"Monte Rosa\", was delivered to Hamburg Süd in 1931, which operated her as a cruise ship, traveling to Norway, the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean. After the Nazi regime came to power in Germany in 1933, she was operated as part of the state-owned \"Kraft durch Freude\" (Strength Through Joy) programme, which provided leisure activities and cheap holidays. She ran aground off Thorshavn, Faroe Islands, on 23 July 1934, but was refloated the next day.\n\nAt the start of World War 2, \"Monte Rosa\" was allocated for military use. She was used as a barracks ship at Stettin, then as a troopship for the invasion of Norway in April 1940. She was later used as an accommodation and recreational ship attached to the battleship \"Tirpitz\", stationed in the north of Norway, from where \"Tirpitz\" and her flotilla attacked the Allied convoys en route to Russia. In 1942, she was one of several ships used for the deportation of Norwegian Jewish people, carrying a total of 46 people from Norway to Denmark, including the Polish-Norwegian businessman and humanitarian Moritz Rabinowitz. Of the 46 deportees carried on \"Monte Rosa\", all but two died in Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nOn 30 March 1944, \"Monte Rosa\" was attacked by British and Canadian Bristol Beaufighters. The strike was mounted for the explicit purpose of sinking her after British Intelligence had obtained details of the ship's movements. The ship was traveling south, escorted by two flak ships, a destroyer and by German fighters. The attacking force consisted of nine aircraft from Royal Air Force 144 Squadron, five of which carried torpedoes, and nine aircraft from Royal Canadian Air Force 404 Squadron, all armed with armour-piercing RP-3 rockets.\n\nThe attack took place close to the Norwegian island of Utsira. The RAF crews claimed two torpedo hits on Monte Rosa; the ship was also struck by eight rockets and by canon-fire. One German Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter was claimed shot down and two Beaufighters were lost, with the two crew of one survived to become prisoners of war. Despite her damage, \"Monte Rosa\" was able to reach Aarhus in Denmark on 3 April. \n\nIn June 1944, Max Manus and Gregers Gram, members of Norwegian Independent Company 1 (a British Army sabotage and resistance unit composed of Norwegians), attached Limpet mines to \"Monte Rosa's\" hull while the ship was in Oslo harbour. They had learned the ship was to carry 3000 German troops back to Germany and their purpose was to sink her during the trip. The pair had twice bluffed their way into the dock area by posing as electricians, then hid for three days as they waited for the ship to arrive. After it docked, they paddled out to her from their hiding place on an inflatable rubber boat and attached their mines. The mines detonated when the ship was near Øresund, damaging the ship, she remained afloat and returned to harbour under her own power.\n\nIn January 1945, the ship was converted into a Hospital ship but was damaged by a mine explosion in February. She received temporary repairs at the German-occupied Polish port of Gdynia then traveled to Copenhagen, carrying 5000 German refugees, fleeing from the advancing Red Army. In May 1945, she was captured by British forces at Kiel and taken as a prize of war.\n\nIn 1946, \"Monte Rosa\" was assigned to the British Ministry of Transport and converted into a troopship. By this time, she was the only survivor of the five Monte-class ships. \"Monte Cervantes\" sank near Tierra del Fuego in 1930, one ship was sunk by an air-raid in 1942; one was badly damaged by bombs and scrapped after the war. \"Monte Pascoal\" was scuttled by the British in 1946.\n\n\"Monte Rosa\" was renamed HMT \"Empire Windrush\" on 21 January 1947, for use on the Southampton-Gibraltar-Suez-Aden-Colombo-Singapore-Hong Kong route, with voyages extended to Kure in Japan after the start of the Korean War. The vessel was operated for the British Government by the New Zealand Shipping Company, and made one voyage only to the Caribbean before resuming normal trooping voyages.\n\nThe new name was one of a series of ship names used by the British government for the vessels that were acquired or chartered for the carriage of troops. Many of these ships were second-hand (like \"Empire Windrush\"), and were renamed when bought. The names were \"Empire\" followed by the name of a British river; in this case the River Windrush, a minor tributary of the Thames, flowing from the Cotswold Hills towards Oxford.\n\nIn 1948, \"Empire Windrush\", which was en route from Australia to England via the Atlantic, docked in Kingston, Jamaica, to pick up servicemen who were on leave. The British Nationality Act 1948 had just been passed, giving the status of citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC status) to all British subjects connected with the United Kingdom or a British colony. Prior to 1962, the UK had no immigration control for CUKCs, who could settle indefinitely in the UK without restrictions. The ship was far from full, and so an opportunistic advertisement was placed in a Jamaican newspaper offering cheap transport on the ship for anybody who wanted to come and work in the UK. Many former servicemen took this opportunity to return to Britain with the hopes of finding better employment including in some cases rejoining the RAF; others decided to make the journey just to see what the 'mother country' was like. One passenger later recalled that demand for tickets far exceeded the supply and there was a long queue to obtain one.\n\nThe ship docked at the Port of Tilbury, near London, on 21 June 1948, and the 1027 passengers began disembarking the next day. A commonly given figure for the number of West Indian immigrants on board is 492 based understandably on news reports in the media at the time, which variously announced that \"more than 400\", \"430\" or \"500\" Jamaican men had arrived in Britain. However, the ship's records, kept in the United Kingdom National Archives indicate conclusively that 802 passengers gave their last place of residence as a country in the Caribbean.\n\nThe ship also carried 66 people whose last country of residence was Mexico - they were a group of Polish people who had travelled from Siberia via India and the Pacific, and who had been granted permission to settle in the United Kingdom under the terms of the Polish Resettlement Act 1947. They had been among a group of Polish people who had been living in Mexico since 1943 and \"Empire Windrush\" had called at Tampico, Mexico in order to pick them up.\n\nOf the other passengers, 119 were from England and 40 from other parts of the world.\n\nThe disembarkation of \"Empire Windrush\"'s passengers was a notable news event, and was covered by newspaper reporters and by Pathé News newsreel cameras. The name Windrush as a result come to be used as shorthand for West Indian migration, and by extension for the beginning of modern British multiracial society.\n\nThe arrival of the ship immediately prompted complaints from some members of parliament, but the first legislation controlling immigration was not passed until 1962. Among the passengers was Sam Beaver King who helped found the Notting Hill Carnival and went on to become the first black Mayor of Southwark. There were also the calypso musicians Lord Kitchener, Lord Beginner, Lord Woodbine and Mona Baptiste. One of the stowaways was Evelyn Wauchope, a 39-year-old dressmaker. She was discovered seven days out of Kingston. A whip-round was organised on board ship, raising £50 – enough for the fare and £4 pocket money for her. Nancy Cunard, heiress to the Cunard shipping fortune, who was on her way back from Trinidad, \"took a fancy to her\" and \"intended looking after her\".\n\nThose who had not already arranged accommodation were temporarily housed in the Clapham South deep shelter in south-west London, less than a mile away from the Coldharbour Lane Employment Exchange in Brixton, where some of the arrivals sought work. The stowaways served brief prison sentences, but were eligible to remain in the United Kingdom on their release.\n\nMany of \"Empire Windrush\"'s passengers only intended to stay for a few years, although a number did return the majority remained to settle permanently. Those born in the West Indies who settled in the UK in this migration movement over the following years are now typically referred to as the \"Windrush Generation\".\n\nIn May 1949, \"Empire Windrush\" was on a voyage from Gibraltar to Port Said when a fire broke out on board. Four ships were put on standby to assist if the ship had to be abandoned. Although the passengers were placed in the lifeboats, they were not launched and the ship was subsequently towed back to Gibraltar.\n\nOn 7 February 1953, around south of the Nicobar Islands, \"Windrush\" sighted a small cargo-ship, the \"Holchu\", adrift and sent out a general warning. The \"Holchu\" was later boarded by the crew of a British cargo ship, alerted by \"Windrush's\" warning. They found no trace of the crew and the \"Holchu\" was towed to Colombo. She was carrying a cargo of rice and was in good condition aside from a broken mast. Adequate supplies of food, water and fuel were found, and a meal had been prepared in the ship's galley. The fate of \"Holchu's\" crew remains unknown and the incident is cited in several works on Ufology and the Bermuda Triangle.\n\nIn June 1953, \"Windrush\" was one of the ships that took part in the Fleet review that marked the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\"Empire Windrush\" set off from Yokohama, Japan, in February 1954 on what proved to be her final voyage. She called at Kure and was to sail to the United Kingdom, calling at Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Aden and Port Said. Her passengers included recovering wounded United Nations veterans of the Korean War, some soldiers from the Duke of Wellington's Regiment wounded at the Third Battle of the Hook in May 1953.\n\nHowever, the voyage was plagued with engine breakdowns and other defects, including a fire after the departure from Hong Kong. It took 10 weeks to reach Port Said, from where the ship sailed for the last time. On board were 222 crew and 1276 passengers, including military personnel and some women and children, dependents of some of the military personnel.\n\nAt around 6:15am on Sunday March 28, there was a sudden explosion and fierce fire in the engine-room that killed the Third Engineer, two other members of the engine-room crew and the First Electrician; a fifth crew-member in the engine room and one in the boiler-room, both Greasers, managed to escape. The ship quickly lost all electrical power as the four main electrical generators were located in the burning engine room; the back-up generator was started, but problems with the main circuit-breaker made its power unusable.\n\nThe ship did not have a sprinkler system. The Chief officer heard the explosion from the ship's bridge and assembled the ship's fire-fighting squad, who happened to be on deck at the time doing routine work. However they were only able to fight the fire for a few minutes before the loss of electrical power stopped the water pumps that fed their fire-hoses. The Second Engineer was able to enter the engine room by wearing a smoke hood, but was unable to close a water-tight door that might have contained the fire, due to a lack of electrical power. Attempts to close all water-tight doors using the controls on the bridge had also failed.\nAt 6:23am, the first distress calls were transmitted; further SOS calls used the emergency radio transmitter as electrical power had been lost. The order was given to wake the passengers and crew and assemble them at their emergency stations, but the ship's public address system was not working, nor were its air and steam whistles, so the order had to be transmitted by word-of-mouth. At 6:45am, all attempts to fight the fire were halted and the order was given to launch the lifeboats, with the first ones away carrying the women and children on-board.\n\nWhile the ship's 22 lifeboats could accommodate all on board, thick smoke and the lack of electrical power prevented many of them from being launched. Each set of lifeboat davits accommodated two lifeboats and without electrical power, raising the wire ropes to lower the second boat was an arduous and slow task. With fire spreading rapidly, the order was given to drop the remaining boats into the sea.\n\nMany of the crew and troops on board abandoned the ship by climbing down ladders or ropes and jumping into the sea. However, they were quickly picked up by Windrush's lifeboats and also by a boat from the first rescue ship, which reached the scene at 7.00am. The ships responding to Windrush's distress call were the Dutch ship , the British P&O Cargo liner , the Norwegian ship and the Italian ships and . A Royal Air Force Avro Shackleton from 224 Squadron assisted in the rescue. The last person to leave \"Windrush\" was the Chief officer at 7:30am. All the passengers were saved and the only fatalities were the four crew killed in the engine room.\nThe rescue vessels took the passengers and crew to Algiers, where they were cared for by the French Red Cross and the French Army. They were taken to Gibraltar by the aircraft carrier , and from there returned to the United Kingdom by air.\n\nAround 26 hours after \"Empire Windrush\" had been abandoned, she was reached by of the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet at a position . The fire was still burning fiercely more than a day after it started, but a party from \"Saintes\" managed to get on board \"Empire Windrush\" and attach a tow-cable. At about midday, \"Saintes\" began to tow the ship to Gibraltar, at a speed of around , but \"Empire Windrush\" sank in the early hours of the following morning, Tuesday, 30 March 1954 at a position . after having been towed a distance of only around . The wreck lies at a depth of around .\n\nAn inquiry into the sinking of \"Empire Windrush\" was held between the 21 June and 7 July 1954. No firm cause for the fire was established, but it was thought the most likely cause was corrosion in one of the ships funnels, or \"uptakes\", may have led to a panel failing, causing incandescently hot soot to fall into the engine room, where it damaged a fuel oil supply pipe and ignited the leaking oil. An alternative theory was that a fractured oil pipe deposited oil onto a hot exhaust pipe. As the ship was government property, she was not insured.\n\nIn 1954, several of the military personnel on board \"Empire Windrush\" during her final voyage received decorations for their role in the evacuation of the burning ship. A military nurse was awarded the Royal Red Cross for her role in evacuating the patients under her care.\n\nIn 1998, an area of public open space in Brixton, London, was renamed Windrush Square to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the arrival of \"Empire Windrush\"'s West Indian passengers. To commemorate the \"Windrush Generation\", in 2008, a Thurrock Heritage plaque was unveiled at the London Cruise Terminal at Tilbury. This chapter in the boat's history was also commemorated, although fleetingly only, in the Pandemonium sequence of the in London, 27 July 2012. A small replica of the ship plastered with newsprint was the facsimile representation in the ceremony.\n\nHamburg Süd commemorates \"Empire Windrush\" by operating a modern container ship with her original name, \"Monte Rosa\".\n\nWindrush carried four, oil-burning, four-stroke single-acting MAN Diesel engines of total, They were single reduction geared in pairs to two propellers. The ship's maximum speed was .\n\nElectrical power was initially provided by three, 350 kW DC generators, powered by internal combustion engines and installed in the engine room; a fourth generator was installed in 1949. There was also an emergency generator. The ship also carried two Scotch marine boilers to produce high-pressure steam for some auxiliary machinery. These could be heated either by burning oil, or by using the hot, exhaust gases from the main engines.\n\nOfficial Numbers are ship identifier numbers assigned to merchant ships by their country of registration. Each country developed its own official numbering system, some on a national and some on a port-by-port basis, and the formats have sometimes changed over time. National Official Numbers shouldn't be confused with IMO Numbers. Flag states still use national systems, which also cover those vessels not subject to the IMO regulations. \"Monte Rosa\" had the German Official Number 1640. She used the Maritime call sign RHWF until 1933 and then DIDU until 1945. When the ship sank in 1954 she had the British Official Number 181561.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7643744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7643744", "title": "History of printing in East Asia", "text": "History of printing in East Asia\n\nPrinting in East Asia evolved from ink rubbings made on paper or cloth from texts on stone tables in China during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 CE). Mechanical woodblock printing on paper started in China during the Tang dynasty before the 8th century CE. Use of woodblock printing quickly spread to other East Asian countries. While the Chinese used only clay and wood movable type at first, use of metal movable type was pioneered in Korea by the 13th century. The Western-style printing press became known in East Asia by the 16th century but was not fully adopted until centuries later.\n\nTraditionally, there have been two main printing techniques in Asia: woodblock printing (xylography) and moveable type printing. In the woodblock technique, ink is applied to letters carved upon a wooden board, which is then pressed onto paper. With moveable type, the board is assembled using different lettertypes, according to the page being printed. Wooden printing was used in the East from the 8th century onwards, and moveable metal type came into use during the 12th century.\n\nThe earliest specimen of woodblock printing on paper, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them, was discovered in 1974 in an excavation of Xi'an (then called Chang'an, the capital of Tang China), Shaanxi, China. It is a \"dharani\" sutra printed on hemp paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the Tang dynasty (618–907). Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang dynasty has also been found, the Saddharmapunṇḍarīka sutra or Lotus Sutra printed from 690 to 699.\n\nIn Korea, an example of woodblock printing from the eighth century was discovered in 1966. A copy of the Buddhist Dharani Sutra called the Pure Light Dharani Sutra (), discovered in Gyeongju, South Korea in a Silla dynasty pagoda that was repaired in 751 AD, was undated but must have been created sometime before the reconstruction of the Shakyamuni Pagoda of Bulguk Temple, Kyongju Province in 751 AD. The document is estimated to have been created no later than 704 AD.\n\nThe manuscript is transcribed onto thin slightly waxed sheets of paper by a professional calligrapher. The paper is placed face down on a block on which a thin layer of rice paste has been thinly spread and the back rubbed with a flat palm-fibre brush so that a clear impression of the inked area is left on the block. The engraving uses a set of sharp-edged tools to cut the characters with a double edged tool used to cut away any extra surfaces. The knife is held like a dagger in the right hand and guided by the middle finger of the left hand, drawing towards the cutter. The vertical lines are cut first, then the block is rotated 90 degrees and the horizontal lines cut.\n\nFour proof-readings are normally required – the transcript, the corrected transcript, first sample print from block and after any corrections have been made. A small correction to a block can be made by cutting a small notch and hammering in a wedge-shaped piece of wood. Larger errors require an inlay. After this the block is washed to remove any refuse.\n\nTo print, the block is fixed firmly on a table. The printer takes a round horsehair inking brush and applies ink with a vertical motion. The paper is then laid on the block and rubbed with a long narrow pad to transfer the impression to the paper. The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done on one side of the paper, and the paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.\n\nSample copies were sometimes made in red or blue, but black ink was always used for production. It is said that a skilled printer could produce as many as 1500 or 2000 double sheets in a day. Blocks can be stored and reused when extra copies are needed. 15,000 prints can be taken from a block with a further 10,000 after touching up.\n\nPrinting started in China in 593 AD. Printing was promoted by the spread of Buddhism.\nThe Buddhist scroll known as the \"Great Dharani Sutra of Immaculate and Pure Light\" or \"Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra\" () is currently the oldest surviving woodblock print. It was published in Korea before the year 751 A.D. during the Silla Kingdom. This Darani Sutra was found inside the Seokga Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju, Korea. Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju in October 1966 within the seokgatap (释迦塔) while dismantling the tower to repair much of the sari was found with the prints. One row of the darani gyeongmun 8-9 are printed in the form of a roll. Tripitaka Koreana was printed between 1011 and 1082. It is the world's most comprehensive and oldest intact version of Buddhist canon. A reprint in 1237–51 used 81,258 blocks of magnolia wood, carved on both sides, which are still kept almost intact at Haeinsa. A printing office was established in the National Academy in 1101 and the Goryeo government collection numbered several tens of thousands.\n\nIn Japan, one thousand copies of the Lotus sutra were printed in 1009 as a pious work, not intended to be read and therefore legibility was not so important. The spread of printing outside Buddhist circles didn't develop until the end of the 16th century.\n\nThe westward movement of printing started from eastern Turkestan where printing in the Uyghur language appeared in about 1300, though the page numbers and descriptions are in Chinese. Both blocks and moveable type printing has been discovered at Turfan as well as several hundred wooden type for Uighur. After the Mongols conquered Turfan, a great number of Uighurs were recruited into the Mongol army and after the Mongols incorporated Persia in the middle of the 13th century, paper money was printed in Tabriz in 1294, following the Chinese system. The was made by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in 1301–11 in his history of the world.\n\nSome fifty pieces of printed matter have been found in Egypt printed between 900 and 1300 in black ink on paper by the rubbing method in the Chinese style. Although there is no transmission evidence, experts believe there is a connection.\n\nAccording to the print scholar A. Hyatt Mayor, \"it was the Chinese who really discovered the means of communication that was to dominate until our age.\" Both woodblock and movable type printing were replaced in the second half of the 19th century by western-style printing, initially lithography.\n\nBi Sheng (毕昇) (990–1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the Northern Song dynasty, using ceramic materials. As described by the Chinese scholar Shen Kuo (沈括) (1031–1095):\n\nIn 1193, Zhou Bida, an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his \"Dream Pool Essays\", and printed his book \"Notes of The Jade Hall\" (《玉堂杂记》).\n\nClay type printing was practiced in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty. As late as 1844 there were still books printed in China with ceramic movable types.\n\nWooden movable type was also first developed around 1040 AD by Bi Sheng (990–1051), as described by the Chinese scholar Shen Kuo (1031–1095), but was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.\nIn 1298, Wang Zhen (王祯/王禎), a Yuan dynasty governmental official of Jingde County, Anhui Province, China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of \"Records of Jingde County\" (《旌德县志》), a book of more than 60,000 Chinese characters. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book \"A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books\". This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored. The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper. In 1322，a Fenghua county officer Ma Chengde (马称德) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed 43 volume \"Daxue Yanyi\" (《大学衍义》). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume \"Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition\" (《武英殿聚珍版丛书》) was printed with 253500 wooden movable type on order of the Yongzheng Emperor, and completed in one year.\n\nA number of books printed in Tangut script during the Western Xia (1038–1227) period are known, of which the \"Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union\" that was discovered in the ruins of Baisigou Square Pagoda in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Western Xia (1139–1193). It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.\n\nA particular difficulty posed the logistical problems of handling the several thousand logographs whose command is required for full literacy in Chinese language. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one was to use movable type for multitudes of the same document, the speed of printing would be relatively quicker.\n\nAlthough the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces.\n\nBronze movable type printing was invented in China no later than the 12th century, according to at least 13 material finds in China, in large scale bronze plate printing of paper money and formal official documents issued by Jin (1115–1234) and Southern Song (1127–1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti counterfeit markers. Such paper money printing might date back to the 11th-century \"jiaozi\" of Northern Song (960–1127).\nThe typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed \"check\" of Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money has different combination of markers. A copper block printed paper money dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of Luo Zhenyu's \"Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties\", 1914, shows two special characters one called \"Ziliao\", the other called \"Zihao\" for the purpose of preventing counterfeit; over the \"Ziliao\" there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the \"Zihao\" there is an empty square hole, apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of Song dynasty money of the same period in the collection of Shanghai Museum has two empty square holes above \"Ziliao\" as well as \"Zihou\", due to the loss of two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued in large scale and in circulation for a long time.\n\nIn the 1298 book \"Zao Huozi Yinshufa\" (《造活字印书法》/《造活字印書法》) by the early Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) official Wang Zhen, there is mention of tin movable type, used probably since the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279), but this was largely experimental. It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the inking process.\n\nDuring the Mongol Empire (1206–1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia. The Uyghurs of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages, a strong evidence that the books were printed in China.\nDuring the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Hua Sui in 1490 used bronze type in printing books. In 1574 the massive 1000 volume encyclopedia Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era (《太平御览》/《太平御覧》) were printed with bronze movable type.\n\nIn 1725, the Qing dynasty government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic \"Gujin Tushu Jicheng\" (《古今图书集成》/《古今圖書集成》, \"Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times\"). Each set consisted of 5040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.\n\nThe transition from wood type to movable metal type occurred in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty, some time in the 13th century, to meet the heavy demand for both religious and secular books. A set of ritual books, \"Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun\" were printed with movable metal type in 1234. The credit for the first metal movable type may go to Choe Yun-ui of the Goryeo Dynasty in 1234.\n\nThe techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. Unlike the metal punch system thought to be used by Gutenberg, the Koreans used a sand-casting method. The following description of the Korean font casting process was recorded by the Joseon dynasty scholar Song Hyon (15th century):\n\nWhile metal movable type printing was developed in Korea and the oldest extant metal print book had been printed in Korea, Korea never witnessed a printing revolution comparable to Europe's:\n\nA potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for two hundred years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable type invention in Europe—when King Sejong devised a simplified alphabet of 24 characters called Hangul for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible.\n\nThough the Jesuits operated a Western movable type printing-press in Nagasaki, Japan, printing equipment brought back by Toyotomi Hideyoshi's army in 1593 from Korea had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, Tokugawa Ieyasu, even before becoming \"shōgun\", effected the creation of the first native movable type, using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.\n\nAn edition of the Confucian \"Analects\" was printed in 1598 using metal moveable type printing equipment at the order of Emperor Go-Yōzei. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the running script style of Japanese writings would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.\n\nDespite the introduction of movable type from the 11th century, printing using woodblocks remained dominant in East Asia until the introduction of lithography and photolithography in the 19th century. To understand this it is necessary to consider both the nature of the language and the economics of printing.\n\nGiven that the Chinese language does not use an alphabet it was usually necessary for a set of type to contain 100,000 or more blocks, which was a substantial investment. Common characters need 20 or more copies, and rarer characters only a single copy. In the case of wood, the characters were either produced in a large block and cut up, or the blocks were cut first and the characters cut afterwards. In either case the size and height of the type had to be carefully controlled to produce pleasing results. To handle the typesetting, Wang Zhen used revolving tables about 2m in diameter in which the characters were divided according to the five tones and the rhyme sections according to the official book of rhymes. The characters were all numbered and one man holding the list called out the number to another who would fetch the type.\n\nThis system worked well when the run was large. Wang Zhen's initial project to produce 100 copies of a 60,000 character gazetteer of the local district was produced in less than a month. But for the smaller runs typical of the time it was not such an improvement. A reprint required resetting and re-proofreading, unlike the wooden block system where it was feasible to store the blocks and reuse them. Individual wooden characters didn't last as long as complete blocks. When metal type was introduced it was harder to produce aesthetically pleasing type by the direct carving method.\n\nIt is unknown whether metal movable types used from the late 15th century in China were cast from moulds or carved individually. Even if they were cast, there were not the economies of scale available with the small number of different characters used in an alphabetic system. The wage for engraving on bronze was many times that for carving characters on wood and a set of metal type might contain 200,000–400,000 characters. Additionally, the ink traditionally used in Chinese printing, typically composed of pine soot bound with glue, didn't work well with the tin originally used for type.\n\nAs a result of all this, movable type was initially used by government offices which needed to produce large number of copies and by itinerant printers producing family registers who would carry perhaps 20,000 pieces of wooden type with them and cut any other characters needed locally. But small local printers often found that wooden blocks suited their needs better.\n\nMechanical presses as used in European printing remained unknown in East Asia. Instead, printing remained an unmechanized, laborious process with pressing the back of the paper onto the inked block by manual \"rubbing\" with a hand tool. In Korea, the first printing presses were introduced as late as 1881–83, while in Japan, after an early but brief interlude in the 1590s, Gutenberg's printing press arrived in Nagasaki in 1848 on a Dutch ship.\n\nContrary to Gutenberg printing, which allowed printing on both sides of the paper from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until very recent times), East Asian printing was done only on one side of the paper, because the need to rub the back of the paper when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed. Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable oil-based ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.\n\n\n\n"}

Rabindranath Tagore suggested to study Vivekananda's works to learn about India. Indian independence activist Subhas Chandra Bose regarded Vivekananda as his spiritual teacher. Mahatma Gandhi said that after reading the works of Vivekananda his love for his nation became a thousand-fold.\n\nBarack Obama, the President of the United States quoted Vivekananda's words in his speech delivered in India in November 2010. Jayalalitha, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu said that Vivekananda inspired her to enter politics. \n\nVivekananda's birthday, on 12 January is celebrated as the National Youth Day in India. In 2012, a three-day world conference was organised by the Institute of World Religions to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda to mark the days Vivekananda delivered his historic lectures in 1893. In 2013, Indian railways started Vivek Express, four pairs of express trains as a tribute to Vivekananda on his 150th birth anniversary.\n\nVivekananda, after he became a \"sannyasin of high intellect, action, and devotion\" in 1886, had a deep desire to spread the message of “divine unity of existence and unity in diversity’ throughout the country. Vivekananda then as a \"Parivrajaka\", meaning: \"a wandering monk\", travelled the length and breadth of the country. For nearly two years, he travelled all over India from north to west, and befriended many notable people and influenced them with his Vedanta philosophy and many of them even encouraged and supported him to travel to the US to attend the Parliament of World Religions in Chicago; some of the prominent names are Ajit Singh of Khetri of Rajasthan, Dewan of Porbandar and Junagadh in Gujarat, Raja of Ramnad of Madras, K. Seshadri Iyer, Dewan of Mysore and Chamaraja Wodeyar, the Maharaja of Mysore.\nBal Gangadhar Tilak, the Indian nationalist, journalist, teacher, social reformer, lawyer and an independence activist who was the first popular leader of the Indian Independence Movement observed :”Twelve centuries ago Sankaracharya was the only great personality, who not only spoke of the purity of our religion, not only uttered in words that this religion was our strength and wealth, not only said that it was our sacred duty to preach this religion in the length and breadth of the world – but also brought all this into action. Swami Vivekananda is a person of that stature—who appeared towards the last half of the 19th century.\"\nRabindranath Tagore suggested \"If you want to know India, study Vivekananda. In him everything is positive and nothing negative.\" Sri Aurobindo has said: \"Vivekananda was a soul of puissance if ever there was one, a very lion among men, but the definite work he has left behind is quite incommensurate with our impression of his creative might and energy. Brahmabandhav Upadhyay told, Vivekananda and his mission encouraged him to go to England and propagate Hinduism and Vedanta there. Bal Gangadhar Tilak praised Vivekananda for taking the responsibility to re-establish the glory of Hinduism. Bipin Chandra Pal felt, Vivekananda's message was \"the message of modern humanity\".\n\nOn 6 February 1921, Mahatma Gandhi came to Belur Math and paid homage to Vivekananda. On this occasion he said: \nI have come here to pay my homage and respect to the revered memory of Swami Vivekananda, whose birthday is being celebrated today. I have gone through his works very thoroughly, and after having gone through them, the love that I had for my country became a thousand-fold. I ask you, young men, not to go away empty-handed without imbibing something of the spirit of the place where Swami Vivekananda lived and died.\n\nHe also told that Vivekananda's writings needed no introduction.\n\nIn 1893, during the journey from Yokohama to Canada on the ship \"Empress\", Vivekananda accidentally met Jamsetji Tata who was also going to Chicago. During the conversation Vivekananda told Tata about the necessity of establishing a world class scientific Institution in India and this encouraged Tata to establish the Indian Institute of Science, which gradually became one of India's best-known research university of India. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of Independent India, praised Vivekananda's personality and dignity and said that his heart carried fire: \"it was no empty talk he was indulging in. He was putting his heart and soul into the words he uttered.\" Nehru also recounted that \"his generation\" was widely influenced by Vivekananda.\nIndian independence activist Subhas Chandra Bose considered Vivekananda as his spiritual teacher. He called Vivekananda a \"full-blooded masculine personality – and a fighter to the core of being\". Bose told, under the \"sacred influence\" of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda his own life got awakened.\n\nVinoba Bhave praised Vivekananda's contribution to make Indians' conscious of their strength and said that he showed them their shortcomings and defects and taught them to overcome these. He further mentioned that at the time of Vivekananda people of India were shrouded in \"tamas\", ignorance and unwisdom, and failed to distinguish between weakness and non-attachment and peace. In such a situation Vivekananda brought new light and he taught \"The same Soul resides in each and all\" and suggested to serve mankind considering them manifestations of God \"daridranarayan\" (meaning: \"poverty stricken god\").\n\nAccording to Indian independence activist and social worker C. Rajagopalachari who became the first Indian Governor General of India, Vivekananda saved Hinduism and India. He stated that we owe everything to Vivekananda. The first Vice-President and the second President of independent India Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan said that Vivekananda's was born in a \"critical period\" when the nation and her people were collapsing in \"despair, frustration and hopelessness\" and in such circumstances Vivekananda's teachings gave them new hope and taught them to rely on spiritual resources. Indian historian Ramesh Chandra Majumdar told, Vivekananda preached the best parts of Hinduism and Indian spirituality to the world. According to Majumdar's studies, Vivekananda's ideals added spiritual basis in the Indian nationalism. Majumdar also noted, though Vivekananda was an ascetic, his patriotism was remarkable. He said:\n\nThough an ascetic, Vivekananda was a patriot of patriots. The thought of restoring the prehistoric glory of India by resuscitating among her people the spiritual vitality which was dormant, but not dead, was always the uppermost though in his mind...\n\nPranab Mukherjee, the President of India, suggested in a speech delivered on 31 May 2013 at the Convocation Hall, University of Mumbai, Mumbai, to remember the call of Vivekananda to reconstruct India's national character. He also told :—\n\nNarendra Modi, the Prime minister of India, is an ardent admirer of Vivekananda. In April 2013, he visited Belur Math and meditated at the room of Vivekananda. Jayalalithaa, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu told, Vivekananda inspired her to enter politics. She said:\n\nMamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal was inspired by Vivekananda's writings which she said helped her in the difficult times of her political career. Banerjee stated:\n\nIn the course of the several movements that I led, there would be moments of doubt. There were some who were critical of me and even I wondered that there were so many people who had pinned their hopes on me. What if I were to fail them? I would read books written by Swami Vivekananda to gather my strength.\n\nIn 2013, Yoga guru Ramdev told he feels Vivekananda spread \"India's cultural message\" to the world.\n\nSocial activist Anna Hazare was motivated by the works of Swami Vivekananda and took inspiration for all the social work he did from Swami Vivekananda only.\n\nArvind Kejriwal read about Swami Vivekananda during his IIT days and was very much inspired from him.\n\nKangana Ranaut considers Swami Vivekananda as her Spiritual Guru and is an ardent follower of his teachings.\n\nVivekananda, during and after his tour of western countries in Europe and the United States had profound influence on notable personalities, who either became his ardent devotees or friends and some even his ardent disciples and many of whom even became ascetics. Right at the beginning of his visit to Chicago to address the Parliament of World Religions Professor John Henry Wright of Harvard University, invited him to speak at Harvard. He pointed out to Vivekananda the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions, which he thought would give an introduction to the nation. Wright's reasoning was \"To ask for your credentials is like asking the sun to state its right to shine in the heavens\". Some of such well-known luminaries are: Max Müller (Indologist), J. J. Goodwin, John Henry Barrows, Mark Twain, Sturdy, Romain Rolland,\nSara Chapman Bull, his American mother and benefactor, Mary Hale, Josephine MacLeod, Christine Greenstidel (who later came to be known as Sister Christine), Maragaret Noble (Sister Nivedita in later years), William James, Josiah Royce, Robert G. Ingersoll, Nikola Tesla, Lord Kelvin, Harriet Monroe, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Sarah Bernhardt, Emma Calvé and Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz He initiated several followers : Marie Louise (a French woman) became Swami Abhayananda, and Leon Landsberg became Swami Kripananda,\n\nAmerican industrialist John D. Rockefeller reportedly made his first large donation for public welfare and later became a notable philanthropist after a meeting with Vivekananda. Vivekananda succinctly explained to Rockfeller that his philanthropy would only be a channel to help the poor and distressed people.\n\nVivekananda influenced French Opera singer Emma Calvé, who wrote in her autobiography:\n\nIt has been my good fortune and my joy to know a man who truly \"walked with God,\" a noble being, a saint, a philosopher, and a true friend. His influence upon my spiritual life was profound. He opened up new horizons before me, enlarging and vivifying my religious ideas and ideals, teaching me a broader understanding of truth. My soul will bear him an eternal gratitude.\n\nVivekananda's life and works have influenced many scholars, writers, politicians worldwide. French writer Romain Rolland wrote that Vivekananda was \"energy personified\". Rolland felt \"kingliness\" was Vivekananda's characteristics, \"He was a born king and nobody ever came near him in India or America without paying homage to his majesty.\" American writer, historian, philosopher Will Durant told, the speeches of Vivekananda were more \"virile\" than the ones delivered in the Vedic times.\n\nThe nationalist leader and the first president of independent Indonesia Sukarno said that it was Swami Vivekananda who inspired him to become strong and to serve God and mankind. Historian and Indologist Arthur Llewellyn Basham compared Vivekananda with other eminent religious figures of India such as Kabir, Adi Shankara, Chaitanya. Russian academician and public figure Eugene Chelyshev was an ardent admirer of Swami Vivekananda. He said:\nReading and re-reading the works of Vivekananda each time I find in them something new that helps deeper to understand India, its philosophy, the way of the life and customs of the people in the past and the present, their dreams of the future...\nChelyshev also predicted that the memory of Vivekananda will never fade away. Chinese scholar Huan Xin Chuan stated that Vivekananda was the most renowned social figure of modern China and Chinese socialists carefully study the works of Vivekananda.\n\nBarack Obama, the President of the United States, quoted Vivekananda's words in his speech delivered in India in November 2010. He said:\n\nInstead of succumbing to division, you have shown that the strength of India—the very idea of India—is its embrace of all colors, castes and creeds. It's the diversity represented in this chamber today. It's the richness of faiths celebrated by a visitor to my hometown of Chicago more than a century ago—the renowned Swami Vivekananda. He said that, \"holiness, purity and charity are not the exclusive possessions of any church in the world, and that every system has produced men and women of the most exalted character.\"\n\nSwami Vivekananda's birthday, i.e. 12 January, is celebrated as the National Youth Day in India. On 17 October 1984, the Indian Government officially declared the birth date of Vivekananda as the National Youth Day, which was to be celebrated 1985 onwards. The circular stated: \"it was felt that the philosophy of Swamiji and the ideals for which he lived and worked could be a great source of inspiration for the Indian Youth.\"\n\nThe \"World Brotherhood Day\" is observed on 11 September, on the day when Vivekananda delivered his first speech at the Parliament of the World's Religions Chicago in 1893 and addressed the American people and his audience as \"Sisters and brothers of America\".\n\nThe 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated in India and abroad during 2013. The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in India officially made an official declaration in this regard. Year-long events and programs have been organised by branches of the Ramakrishna Math, the Ramakrishna Mission, the central and state governments in India, educational institutions and youth groups. Bengali film director Tutu (Utpal) Sinha made a film, \"\", and Indian American Bengali animator and laserist Manick Sorcar created a laser show, \"Swamiji\", as a tribute for his 150th birth anniversary.\n\nSwami Vivekananda delivered his famous lectures at the Parliament of the World's Religions, Chicago in 1893. In 2012, a 3-day World conference was organised by the Institute of World Religions (of the Washington Kali Temple), Burtonsville, Maryland, in association with the Council for Parliament of World Religions, Chicago, Illinois to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.\n\nIn 2011—2013 Railway Budget, Indian railways announced four pairs of new express trains on the Indian Railways network. These new trains were started as a tribute to Vivekananda on his 140th birth anniversary.\n\nTo mark the anniversary of Swami Vivekananda's landmark address at the Chicago Art Institute, and in remembrance of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon 108 years later on that very date, September 11, Indian artist Jitish Kallat created Public Notice 3, a site-specific installation on the Art Institute's Woman's Board Grand Staircase.\n\nOn January 28, 2012, the Art Institute of Chicago, in conjunction with the Republic of India, reinstalled a plaque commemorating Vivekananda's landmark speech outside Fullerton Hall.\n\nBengali\nSwami Vivekananda has been the primary topic of many films, dramas ad folk-plays. Bengali film director Amar Mullick made two different movies: Swamiji (1949) and its adaptation in Hindi, \"Swami Vivekananda\" (1955). The film \"Swami Vivekananda\" (1955) is considered a \"faithful and memorable documentation feature\" on Vivekananda.\n\nThe \"Swami Vivekananda\" was released on 12 June 1998. The film was premiered on India's public service broadcaster Doordarshan on 15 August 1998 as a part of Doordarshan's celebration of 50th year of India's Independence. The film has been appreciated for blending the role of \"eccentric middle-aged mystic, nominally a Brahmin priest, claiming nothing short of godhood role “ of Paramahmsa very well with that of the “ young non-Brahmin agnostic modernist role\" of Vivekananda.\n\nIn 2013, Utpal (Tutu) Sinha directed \"\" which was a tribute to Vivekananda on his 150th anniversary of his birth. Indian American Bengali animator and laserist Manick Sorcar created a laser show, \"Swamiji\", in honor of the anniversary.\n\nBengali theatre group \"Lokkrishti\" staged a drama \"Biley\" to commemorate the birth anniversary. Bengali theatre actor Debshankar Haldar played the role of Swami Vivekananda in this drama. In 2013 \"Belgharia Shankhamala theatre group\" staged the drama \"Bireswar\". The drama was written by Basab Dasgupta and directed by Debesh Chattopadhyay.\n\n"}

Harrison is one of the founders, with Karl Kerenyi and Walter Burkert, of modern studies in Ancient Greek religion and mythology. She applied 19th century archaeological discoveries to the interpretation of ancient Greek religion in ways that have become standard. She has also been credited with being the first woman to obtain a post in England as a ‘career academic’. Harrison argued for women's suffrage but thought she would never want to vote herself. Ellen Wordsworth Crofts, later second wife of Sir Francis Darwin, was Jane Harrison's best friend from her student days at Newnham, and during the period from 1898 to her death in 1903.\n\nHarrison was born in Cottingham, Yorkshire on 9 September 1850. Her mother died shortly after she was born and she was educated by a series of governesses. Her governesses taught her German, Latin, Ancient Greek and Hebrew, but she later expanded her knowledge to about sixteen languages, including Russian.\n\nHarrison spent most of her professional life at Newnham College, the progressive, recently established college for women at Cambridge. At Newnham, one of her students was Eugenie Sellers, the writer and poet, with whom she lived in England and later in Paris and possibly even had a relationship with in the late 1880s.\nBetween 1880 and 1897 Harrison studied Greek art and archaeology at the British Museum under Sir Charles Newton. Harrison then supported herself lecturing at the museum and at schools (mostly private boy's schools). Her lectures became widely popular and 1600 people ended up attending her Glasgow lecture on Athenian gravestones. She travelled to Italy and Germany, where she met the scholar from Prague, Wilhelm Klein. Klein introduced her to Wilhelm Dörpfeld who invited her to participate in his archaeological tours in Greece. Her early book \"The Odyssey in Art and Literature\" then appeared in 1882. Harrison met the scholar D. S. MacColl, who supposedly asked her to marry him and she declined. Harrison then suffered a severe depression and started to study the more primitive areas of Greek art in an attempt to cure herself.\n\nIn 1888 Harrison began to publish in the periodical that Oscar Wilde was editing called \"The Woman's World\" on \"The Pictures of Sappho.\" Harrison also ended up translating \"Mythologie figurée de la Grèce\" (1883) by Maxime Collignon as well as providing personal commentary to selections of \"Pausanias, Mythology & Monuments of Ancient Athens\" by Margaret Verrall in the same year. These two major works caused Harrison to be awarded honorary degrees from the universities of Durham (1897) and Aberdeen (1895).\n\nHarrison was then engaged to marry the scholar R. A. Neil, but he died suddenly of appendicitis in 1901 before they could marry.\n\nShe became the central figure of the group known as the Cambridge Ritualists. In 1903 her book \"Prolegomena on the Study of Greek Religion\" appeared. Harrison became close to Francis MacDonald Cornford (1874–1943), and when he married in 1909 she became extremely upset. She then made a new friendship with Hope Mirrlees whom she referred to as her \"spiritual daughter\".\n\nHarrison retired from Newnham in 1922 and then moved to Paris to live with Mirrlees. She and Mirrlees returned to London in 1925 where she was able to publish her memoirs through Leonard and Virginia Woolf's press, The Hogarth Press. She lived three more years, to the age of 77, and passed away at her house in Bloomsbury. She is now buried in St Marylebone Cemetery, East Finchley.\n\nHarrison was an atheist.\n\nHarrison was, at least ideologically, a moderate suffragist. Rather than support women's suffrage by protesting, Harrison applied her scholarship in anthropology to defend women's right to vote. In responding to an anti-suffragist critic, Harrison demonstrates this moderate ideology:\n[The Women's Movement] is not an attempt to arrogate man's prerogative of manhood; it is not even an attempt to assert and emphasize women's privilege of womanhood; it is simply the demand that in the life of woman, as in the life of man, space and liberty shall be found for a thing bigger than either manhood or womanhood – for humanity. (84–85, \"Alpha and Omega\") \nTo this end, Harrison's motto was Terence's \"homo sum; humani nihil mihi alienum est\" (\"I am a human being; nothing that is human do I account alien.\")\n\nHarrison began formal study at Cheltenham Ladies' College, where she gained a Certificate, and, in 1874, continued her studies in the classics at Cambridge University's Newnham College. Her early work earned Harrison two honorary doctorates, an LLD from University of Aberdeen in 1895 and DLitt from the University of Durham in 1897. This recognition afforded Harrison the opportunity to return to Newnham College as a lecturer in 1898, and her position was renewed continuously until Harrison retired in 1922.\n\nHarrison's first monograph, in 1882, drew on the thesis that both Homer's \"Odyssey\" and motifs of the Greek vase-painters were drawing upon similar deep sources for mythology, the opinion that had not been common in earlier classical archaeology, that the repertory of vase-painters offered some unusual commentaries on myth and ritual.\n\nHer approach in her great work, \"Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion\" (1903), was to proceed from the ritual to the myth it inspired.: \"In theology facts are harder to seek, truth more difficult to formulate than in ritual.\" Thus she began her book with analyses of the best-known of the Athenian festivals: Anthesteria, harvest festivals Thargelia, Kallynteria, Plynteria, and the women's festivals, in which she detected many primitive survivals, Thesmophoria, Arrophoria, Skirophoria, Stenia and Haloa.\n\nHarrison alluded to and commented on the cultural applications of Charles Darwin's work. Harrison and her generation depended upon anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor (who was himself influenced by Darwin and evolutionary ideas) for some new themes of cultural evolution, especially his 1871 work, \"Primitive Culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, language, art, and custom\". After a socially Darwinian analysis of the origins of religion, Harrison argues that religiosity is anti-intellectual and dogmatic, yet she defended the cultural necessity of religion and mysticism. In her essay \"The Influence of Darwinism on the Study of Religion\" (1909), Harrison concluded:\nEvery dogma religion has hitherto produced is probably false, but for all that the religious or mystical spirit may be the only way of apprehending some things, and these of enormous importance. It may also be that the contents of this mystical apprehension cannot be put into language without being falsified and misstated, that they have rather to be felt and lived than uttered and intellectually analyzed; yet they are somehow true and necessary to life. (176, \"Alpha and Omega\")\n\nWorld War I marked a deep break in Harrison's life. Harrison never visited Italy or Greece after the war: she mostly wrote revisions or synopses of previous publications, and pacifist leanings isolated her. Upon retiring (in 1922), Harrison briefly lived in Paris, but she returned to London when her health began to fail.\n\nThe critic Camille Paglia has written of Harrison's influence on her own work. Paglia argues that Harrison's career has been ignored by second-wave feminists, who Paglia thinks object to Harrison's findings and efface the careers of prominent pre-WWII female scholars to bolster their claims of male domination in academe. Mary Beard's numerous essays and book on Harrison's life, as well as several other biographies of Harrison, have moved the needle however toward much more appreciation of Harrison's achievements, as well as further understanding of the context in which she worked. She remains a controversial figure, with several biographies giving rival accounts of her life and loves.\n\nBooks on the anthropological search for the origins of Greek religion and mythology, include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22220817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22220817", "title": "Jessie Webb", "text": "Jessie Webb\n\nJessie Stobo Watson Webb (31 July 1880 – 17 February 1944) was an Australian academic and historian, one of the first female teachers at the University of Melbourne. The only monograph of Webb's life is by R. T. Ridley, published by the History Department of Melbourne University.\n\nWebb was born in 1880 on Ellerslie Station, near Tumut, at the foot of the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales. Webb was the only child of grazier Charles Webb, originally from New Zealand, and his wife Jessie Webb, née Watson, of Scotland, who died shortly after childbirth. Webb was orphaned at age nine when her father died after an accident, and Webb was sent to live with her mother's family in Melbourne.\n\nWebb attended Balaclava College, in Melbourne's inner south-eastern suburbs, and passed her matriculation exams in October 1896 at the age of sixteen. She enrolled at the University of Melbourne on Valentine's Day 1898. During her undergraduate study she won the Cobden Club medal, and a share of the J. D. Wyselaskie scholarship in English constitutional history, before graduating a Bachelor of Arts in April 1902, attaining first-class honours in both history and political economy, as well as logic and philosophy. In 1904 Webb would add to this a Masters of Arts.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1912 Webb tutored history and political economy at Trinity College at the University of Melbourne; during this time she also tutored at Ormond College and at several girls' secondary schools. Webb also operated an independent coaching college, staffed with other female university graduates, who ran tutoring programs catering for students from matriculation level through the whole duration of undergraduate courses. In May 1906 she registered with the government as a teacher.\n\nIn December 1908, after her third application to the University, Webb was employed as a night lecturer with the history department – the first woman to be appointed to such a position in Australia – teaching ancient and British history. At her appointment, Webb was the only other teacher in the department, aside from Professor John Simeon Elkington.\n\nOn Elkington's retirement in 1913, she was elevated to a full-time lecturer, after Ernest Scott, the new professor, successfully lobbied the University to provide for a full-time assistant. Under Scott, and later under Scott's successor, Max Crawford, Webb served as acting professor whenever the professor himself was on leave, taking over their classes and their administrative duties too. Webb had extensive teaching responsibilities of her own; in 1914, for example, she gave two lectures each week in Ancient History, and two further evening lectures in both Ancient History and British History Part I weekly, in addition to a tutorial class with the honours students and consultations on the students' work. Webb was primarily responsible for communicating with the correspondence students, and she even \"sent her own books out on rotation to these students as the university provided no funding to buy books for circulation.\" Webb did not underestimate the importance of those students, comprising as they did about a quarter of the faculty's enrolment in 1913, \"and she knew that many of them were teachers trying to improve their qualifications.\"\nWebb was promoted to become a senior lecturer within the history department in 1923; in 1925 she was an acting professor. Webb was an acting professor again in 1933–34 and in 1942–44. However, despite Max Crawford recommending Webb for an associate professorship in his 1937 report to the University, Webb was never permanently promoted beyond the position of lecturer, only ever acting as a fill-in. Her friend Dr Sweet had been appointed to an associate professorship in 1919, the first female to hold such a position at the University, though only after being passed over in the search for a full professor to succeed Baldwin Spencer, despite extensive support and recommendation from within the local and international academic community. Discrimination against women in academia was not uncommon at the time. In a speech to the University's Historical Society in 1928, reported in \"Farrago\", Webb spoke sardonically of the systematic exclusion of women from the archaeological profession. Webb's friend Ella Latham could no longer continue in her own teaching career after her marriage. Indeed, Webb herself was only employed by the University on her third application, having been beaten twice prior by male candidates with, on paper, lesser qualifications than she. Webb remained the only female employee in the history department until the appointment of Kathleen Fitzpatrick in 1938.\n\nBeginning in 1924, Webb organised regular purchases on behalf of the University of ancient coins and statuary casts, for the purposes of study and to decorate the Arts faculty building. The Jessie Webb Collection now forms part of the Classics and Archaeology Collection at the Ian Potter Museum of Art. Elsewhere in university life, Webb contributed to the founding of the University Women's College – since 1975 known as University College – which was established in 1933.\n\nWebb joined in 1909 with her friend Ella Latham – fellow 1902 Melbourne Arts graduate, fellow tutor at her coaching academy, and wife of John Latham, future Chief Justice of Australia – in editing a literary anthology designed for school students, \"Phases of Literature: From Pope to Browning\". The book was small, but included substantial notes on the selected texts which, evincing Webb's influence, were peppered with classical and historical references. It was to be the only work that Webb ever published.\n\nAside from her academic employment, Webb was involved in a variety of community activities during this time. When the Royal Historical Society of Victoria was founded in 1909, it met in Webb's rooms in the Block Arcade. Webb was a founding member of the Lyceum Club in 1912, and from 1920 to 1922 was the Club's president. In 1922 Webb was a founding member of the Victorian Women Graduates' Association (now the Australian Federation of University Women, Victoria); she was president of this body also, from 1924 to 1925. During the First World War, Webb campaigned for conscription along with a group of other university staff; she and Harrison Moore produced a pro-conscription pamphlet.\n\nIn late 1922 and early 1923 Webb joined Dr Georgina Sweet, fellow lecturer and also a founding Lyceum Club and Women Graduates' Association member, on a journey through Africa, crossing the continent from Cape Town, Cape Colony to Cairo, Egypt. Webb had a strong interest in Greek history, and following her trip to Africa, she spent eight months at the British School at Athens. During this time she visited archaeological sites in Mycenae and Knossos (where she was taken on a tour by Arthur Evans), and toured Crete on the back of a mule. Later in 1923, Webb was an alternate delegate for Australia to the League of Nations.\n\nIn August 1926, Webb and her friend and fellow Lyceum member Alice Anderson travelled to central Australia, driving to Alice Springs and back in an Austin 7. Anderson, a pioneering female mechanic and motor garage owner-operator, died shortly after returning from the six-week trip, after accidentally shooting herself while cleaning some guns borrowed for the journey.\n\nWebb returned to Europe again in 1936 – sailing out on a Norwegian cargo ship – beginning in England, North Africa (where she visited Greek and Roman settlements) and France, then travelling to Athens by train, and onwards to Turkey's Aegean coast and then inland to Cappadocia. She returned via Germany, Syria and Mesopotamian sites in Iraq such as Ur and Babylon. For most of the journey Webb travelled alone, by bus and by train. Webb did not neglect her teaching duties during this time, however, composing nine exam papers for her subjects and posting them back to Australia ready to be sat by her students.\n\nDuring her last stint as acting professor, Webb continued to exercise her administrative duties in running the history department despite being hospitalised with cancer. Webb died at the Linden Private Hospital in St Kilda in 1944. Following her death, the library in the history department at the University was named after her. Webb bequeathed £7128 to the University in her will, which is used to fund the Jessie Webb Scholarship, which provides funding for a student to emulate Webb's own experience at the British School, to study and research for a season in Greece.\n\nWebb's contribution to history and the teaching of history in Melbourne has been little noticed by subsequent generations. That Webb did not publish any historical work has contributed to this, though Kathleen Fitzpatrick has said that Webb \"underestimated her ability and scholarship, and probably felt handicapped by distance from ancient sites, great libraries and professional colleagues which could not be bridged by rare periods of overseas leave.\" Susan Janson has posited that the strong focus on the publication of research is an aspect of later generations, and that Webb \"was trained in an older tradition that stressed the pedagogical imperative for history\".\n\nThough Webb did not publish, she was for the most part well regarded for the quality of her teaching and the scholarship that went into her lectures. To the practice of history as taught at Melbourne, Webb brought an emphasis on historiography, and critical investigation of secondary material, alongside an associated emphasis on the use of primary sources. Richard Selleck argues that for the quality of her teaching, Webb \"was respected in her time and honoured after her career finished,\" distinguishing herself particularly in delivering an excellent standard of education to the night students and the correspondence students, two groups not favoured by the central administration of the University. Ronald Ridley has praised the scope of her teaching, encompassing not just political but economic, social and cultural history, and covering not merely Greek and Roman civilisation but their antecedents in the region also, the introduction of which into the curriculum Ridley regards as her \"most fundamental contribution to the students' awareness\". Though Manning Clark was disappointed at the lack of \"wisdom and understanding\" he had sought but failed to find in Webb's lectures, A. A. Phillips praised her knack for human observation, which he compared to that of Jane Austen, and Keith Hancock rated her among the best three teachers he had at Melbourne.\n\nWhile Webb's speciality was Ancient Greek history, she was well read in all classical history; she had a strong interest in Roman history, and followed the rapidly developing fields of Egyptian and Mesopotamian history and archaeology throughout her career. Former students noted the breadth of Webb's interests and reading, and her frequent inclusion of the best contemporary research in her lectures. Susan Janson has praised the sustained quality and variety of the large number of exam papers Webb set over the course of her career, and argued that \"[i]f we take [them] as our evidence of Jessie Webb's productivity, we can revalue her work as a historian.\"\n\nThe Jessie Webb Award is presented annually by the Numismatic Association of Victoria for the best article by a female author in the Victorian Numismatic Journal.\n\n"}

He was invited to pursue the Maître Agrégé of the École Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin at the Université catholique de Louvain, where he later studied and completed his degree in 1981 on the metaphysical thought of Godfrey of Fontaines.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18576", "title": "La Malinche", "text": "La Malinche\n\nLa Malinche (; c. 1496 or c. 1501 – c. 1529), known also as Malinalli , Malintzin or Doña Marina , was a Nahua woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast, who played a key role in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, acting as an interpreter, advisor, and intermediary for the Spanish conquistador, Hernán Cortés. She was one of 20 women slaves given to the Spaniards by the natives of Tabasco in 1519. Later, she gave birth to Cortés's first son, Martín, who is considered one of the first Mestizos (people of mixed European and indigenous American ancestry).\n\nThe historical figure of Marina has been intermixed with Aztec legends (such as \"La Llorona\", a ghost woman who weeps for her lost children). Her reputation has been altered over the years according to changing social and political perspectives, especially after the Mexican Revolution, when she was portrayed in dramas, novels, and paintings as an evil or scheming temptress. In Mexico today, La Malinche remains iconically potent. She is understood in various and often conflicting aspects as the embodiment of treachery, the quintessential victim, or simply as symbolic mother of the new Mexican people. In a recent book, ethnohistorian Matthew Restall views Malinche as representative of one of the darkest aspects of the Conquest in which Spaniards routinely trafficked in young women by acquiring slaves and capturing and selling young women into slavery, including sex slavery. The term \"malinchista\" refers to a disloyal compatriot, especially in Mexico. \n\nBecause of her controversial symbolization, a statue of La Malinche, Cortés, and their son Martín was removed soon after it was erected in Coyoacan, in the outskirts of Mexico City, in 1982. The statue was intended to be respectful of her trials and to emphasize the mestizo (or mixed-blood) character of the nation. However, student protests erupted: the protesters wanted no monument that presented Malinche in a positive light, for in their minds she was too closely associated with domination by outsiders and with betrayal.\n\nLa Malinche (also known as Malinalli, Malintzin or doña Marina) was born sometime between 1496 and 1501, in the region between the Aztec-ruled Valley of Mexico and the Maya states of the Yucatán Peninsula. She had come into a world that existed on the fringes of the political influence exerted by the particular group of Nahuas known today as the Aztecs (they called themselves \"mexicas\"). Malintzin was named after the Goddess of Grass, and later Tenepal meaning \"one who speaks with liveliness.\"\n\nIn her youth, her father Cacique of Paynala died, and her mother remarried another Cacique and bore a son. Now a stepchild, the girl was given to some people from Xicalango. Bernal Díaz del Castillo claims Malintzin's family faked her death by telling the townspeople that a recently deceased child of a slave was Malintzin. The Xicalango gave the child to the Tabascans.Before she was 20, she was renamed Marina by Spanish newcomers and called Malintzin by other indigenous people.\n\nMalintzin was introduced to the Spanish in April 1519, when she was among 20 slave women given by the Chontal Maya of Potonchán (in the present-day state of Tabasco) after the Spaniards defeated them in battle. At this time, she was probably in her late teens or early 20s. It isn't clear how Malintzin was treated or how she felt about her captors at the time. Bernal Díaz del Castillo remarked on her beauty and graciousness; she was the only one of the slaves whose name he remembered. (He called her Marina, the Christian name she took upon being baptized in 1519.) Cortés singled her out as a gift for Alonso Hernandez Puertocarrero, perhaps the most well-born member of the expedition. Soon, however, Puertocarrero was on his way to Spain as Cortés' emissary to Charles V, and Cortés kept her by his side for her value as an interpreter who spoke two native languages: Mayan and Nahuatl.\n\nAccording to Díaz, she spoke to emissaries from Moctezuma in their native tongue Nahuatl and pointed to Cortés as the chief Spaniard to speak for them. Cortés had located a Spanish priest, Gerónimo de Aguilar, who had spent several years in captivity among the Maya peoples in Yucatán following a shipwreck. Thus, he had learned some Mayan, but he did not speak Nahuatl. Cortés used Marina for translating between the Nahuatl language (the common language of central Mexico of that time) and the Chontal Maya language. Then Aguilar could interpret from Mayan to Spanish until Marina learned Spanish and could be the sole interpreter.\n\nCortés kept her by his side so much so that Aztec codices always show her picture drawn alongside of Cortés. The natives of Tlaxcala, who formed an alliance with Cortés against Moctezuma, called both Marina and Cortés by the same name: Malintzin. (The -tzin suffix was the Nahuatl equivalent of \"sir\" or \"lady\" bestowed on them by the Tlaxcalans.)\n\nAccording to surviving records, Marina learned of a plan by natives of Cholula to cooperate with the Aztecs to destroy the small Spanish army. She alerted Cortés to the danger and even pretended to be cooperating with her native informants while Cortés foiled their plot to trap his men. Cortés turned the tables on them and slaughtered many Cholulans. In this manner, she is often considered as a traitor by many and her name is not revered among many locals. \n\nFollowing the fall of Tenochtitlán in late 1521 and the birth of her son Martín Cortés in 1522, Marina stayed in a house Cortés built for her in the town of Coyoacán, eight miles south of Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital city, while it was being rebuilt as Mexico City. Cortés took Marina to quell a rebellion in Honduras in 1524–1526 when she is seen serving again as interpreter (suggestive of a knowledge of Maya dialects beyond Chontal and Yucatán.) While in the mountain town of Orizaba in central Mexico, she married Juan Jaramillo, a Spanish hidalgo. Historians such as Prescott generally lost track of Marina after her journey to Central America. Some contemporary scholars have estimated that she died less than a decade after the conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlan at some point in 1529. Historian Sir Hugh Thomas in his book \"Conquest\" reports the probable date of her death as 1551, deduced from letters he discovered in Spain alluding to her as alive in 1550 and deceased after 1551. She was survived by her son Don Martín, who would be raised primarily by his father's family, and a daughter Doña María who would be raised by Jaramillo and his second wife Doña Beatriz de Andrada.\n\nFor the conquistadores, having a reliable interpreter was important enough, but there is evidence that Marina's role and influence were larger still. Bernal Díaz del Castillo, a soldier who, as an old man, produced the most comprehensive of the eye-witness accounts, the \"Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España\" (\"True Story of the Conquest of New Spain\"), speaks repeatedly and reverentially of the \"great lady\" Doña Marina (always using the honorific title Doña). \"Without the help of Doña Marina,\" he writes, \"we would not have understood the language of New Spain and Mexico.\" Rodríguez de Ocaña, another conquistador, relates Cortés' assertion that after God, Marina was the main reason for his success.\n\nThe evidence from indigenous sources is even more interesting, both in the commentaries about her role, and in her prominence in the codex drawings made of conquest events. Although to some Marina may be known as a traitor, she was not viewed as such by all the Tlaxcalan. In some depictions they portrayed her as \"larger than life\", sometimes larger than Cortés, in rich clothing, and an alliance is shown between her and the Tlaxcalan instead of them and the Spaniards. They respected and trusted her and portrayed her in this light generations after the Spanish conquest. \n\nIn the \"Lienzo de Tlaxcala (History of Tlaxcala)\", for example, not only is Cortés rarely portrayed without Marina poised by his side, but she is shown at times on her own, seemingly directing events as an independent authority. If she had been trained for court life, as in Díaz's account, her relationship to Cortés may have followed the familiar pattern of marriage among native elite classes. The role of the Nahua wife acquired through an alliance would have been to assist her husband achieve his military and diplomatic objectives. \n\nToday's historians give great credit to Marina's diplomatic skills, with some \"almost tempted to think of her as the real conqueror of Mexico.\" In fact, old conquistadors on various occasions would remember that one of her greatest skills had been her ability to convince other Indians of what she herself could see clearly, which was that it was useless in the long run to stand against Spanish metal and Spanish ships. In contrast with earlier parts of Díaz del Castillo's account, after Marina's diplomacy began assisting Cortés, the Spanish were forced into combat on one more occasion.\n\nHad La Malinche not been part of the Conquest of Mexico for her linguistic gift, communication between the Spanish and the Indigenous would have been much harder. La Malinche knew to speak in different registers and tones between certain Indigenous tribes and people. For the Nahua audiences, she spoke rhetorically, formally, and high-handedly. This shift into formality give the Nahua the impression that she was a noblewoman who knew what she was talking about.\n\nThe many uncertainties which surround Malinche's role in the Spanish conquest begin with her name and its several variants. At birth she was named Malinalli or Malinal after the Goddess of Grass, on whose name-day she was born. Later, her family added the name Tenepal which means “one who speaks much and with liveliness”.\n\nAfter being baptized, the 20 slave girls were distributed by Cortes among his Spanish captains. Malinalli then took the Christian name of Marina, to which the soldiers of Cortés added the Doña, meaning lady.\n\nIt is not known whether Marina was chosen because of a phonetic resemblance to her actual name, or chosen randomly from among common Spanish names of the time. A Nahuatl mispronunciation of Marina as Malin plus the reverential \"-tzin\" suffix, formed the compounded title of Malintzin, which the natives used for both Marina and Cortes, because he spoke through her.\n\nToday in Mexican Spanish the word malinchismo and malinchista is used to denounce Mexicans who are perceived as denying their own cultural heritage by preferring foreign cultural expressions.\n\nSome historians believe that La Malinche saved her people from the Aztecs, who held a hegemony throughout the territory and demanded tribute from its inhabitants. Some Mexicans also credit her with having brought Christianity to the New World from Europe, and for having influenced Cortes to be more humane than he would otherwise have been. It is argued, however, that without her help, Cortes would not have been successful in conquering the Aztecs as quickly, giving the Aztec people enough time to adapt to new technology and methods of warfare. From that viewpoint, she is seen as one who betrayed the indigenous people by siding with the Spaniards. Recently a number of feminist Latinas have decried such a categorization as scapegoating.\n\nMalinche’s image has become a mythical archetype that Hispanic American artists have represented in various forms of art. Her figure permeates historical, cultural, and social dimensions of Hispanic American cultures. In modern times and in several genres, she is compared with the La Llorona (folklore story of the woman weeping for lost children), and the Mexican soldaderas (women who fought beside men during the Mexican Revolution) for their brave actions.\n\nLa Malinche's legacy is one of myth mixed with legend, and the opposing opinions of the Mexican people about the legendary woman. Some see her as a founding figure of the Mexican nation. While others, however, continue to find the legends more memorable than the history, seeing her as a traitor, as may be assumed from a legend that she had a twin sister who went North and the pejorative nickname La Chingada associated with her twin.\n\nFeminist interventions into the figure of Malinche began in 1960s. The work of Rosario Castellanos was particularly significant. Her subsequent poem La Mallinche recast her not as a traitor but as a victim. Mexican feminists defended Malinche as a woman caught between cultures, forced to make complex decisions, who ultimately served as a mother of a new race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}
{"id": "7843173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7843173", "title": "Lumières", "text": "Lumières\n\nThe Lumières (literally in English: \"Enlighteners\") was a cultural, philosophical, literary and intellectual movement of the second half of the 18th century, originating in France and spreading throughout Europe. It included philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, Pierre Bayle and Isaac Newton. Over time it came to mean the , in English the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nMembers of the movement saw themselves as a progressive élite, and battled against religious and political persecution, fighting against what they saw as the irrationality, arbitrariness, obscurantism and superstition of the previous centuries. They redefined the study of knowledge to fit the ethics and aesthetics of their time. Their works had great influence at the end of the 18th century, in the American Declaration of Independence and the French Revolution.\n\nThis intellectual and cultural renewal by the Lumières movement was, in its strictest sense, limited to Europe, and was almost exclusively a development of the ideas of Renaissance humanism. These ideas were well understood in Europe, but beyond France the idea of \"enlightenment\" had generally meant a light from outside, whereas in France it meant a light coming from within oneself.\n\nIn the most general terms, in science and philosophy, the Enlightenment aimed for the triumph of reason over faith and belief; in politics and economics, the triumph of the bourgeois over nobility and clergy.\n\nThe Lumières movement was in large part an extension of the discoveries of Nicolas Copernicus in the 16th century, which were not well known during his lifetime, and more so of the theories of Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642). Inquiries to establish certain axioms and mathematical proofs continued as Cartesianism throughout the 17th century.\n\nGottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646 – 1716) and Isaac Newton (1642 – 1727) had independently and almost simultaneously developed the calculus, and René Descartes (1596 – 1650) the idea of monads. British philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes and David Hume adopted an approach, later called empiricism, which preferred the use of the senses and experience over that of pure reason.\n\nBaruch Spinoza took Descartes' side, most of all in his \"Ethics\". But he demurred from Descartes in (\"On the Improvement of the Understanding\"), where he argued that the process of perception is not one of pure reason, but also the senses and intuition. Spinoza's thought was based on a model of the universe where God and Nature are one and the same. This became an anchor in the Age of Enlightenment, held across the ages from Newton's time to that of Thomas Jefferson's (1743–1826).\n\nA notable change was the emergence of a naturalist philosophy, spreading across Europe, embodied by Newton. The scientific method – exploring experimental evidence and constructing consistent theories and axiom systems from observed phenomena – was undeniably useful. The predictive ability of its resulting theories set the tone for his masterwork \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" (1687). As an example of scientific progress in the Age of Reason and the Lumières movement, Newton's example remains unsurpassed, in taking observed facts and constructing a theory which explains them a priori, for example taking the motions of the planets observed by Johannes Kepler to confirm his law of universal gravitation. Naturalism saw the unification of pure empiricism as practiced by the likes of Francis Bacon with the axiomatic, \"pure reason\" approach of Descartes.\n\nBelief in an intelligible world ordered by a Christian God became the crux of philosophical investigations of knowledge. On one side, religious philosophy concentrated on piety, and the omniscience and ultimately mysterious nature of God; on the other were ideas such as deism, underpinned by the impression that the world was comprehensible by human reason and that it was governed by universal physical laws. God was imagined as a \"Great Watchmaker\"; experimental natural philosophers found the world to be more and more ordered, even as machines and measuring instruments became ever more sophisticated and precise.\n\nThe most famous French natural philosopher of the 18th Century, Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon, was critical of this natural theology in his masterwork \"Histoire Naturelle\". Buffon rejected the idea of ascribing to divine intervention and the \"supernatural\" that which science could now explain. This criticism brought him up against the Sorbonne which, dominated by the Roman Catholic Church, never stopped trying to censor him. In 1751, he was ordered to redact some propositions contrary to the teaching of the Church; having proposed 74,000 years for the age of the Earth, this was contrary to the Bible which, using the scientific method on data found in biblical concordances, dated it to around 6,000 years. The Church was also hostile to his no less illustrious contemporary Carl von Linné, and some have concluded that the Church simply refused to believe that order existed in nature.\n\nThis effort to research and elucidate universal laws, and to determine their component parts, also became an important element in the construction of a philosophy of individualism, where everyone had rights based only on fundamental human rights. There developed the philosophical notion of the thoughtful subject, an individual who could make decisions based on pure reason and no longer in the yoke of custom. In \"Two Treatises of Government\", John Locke argued that property rights are not held in common but are totally personal, and made legitimate by the work required to obtain the property, as well as its protection (recognition) by others. Once the idea of natural law is accepted, it becomes possible to form the modern view of what we would now call political economy.\n\nIn his famous essay \"\" (, ), Emmanuel Kant defined the Lumières thus:\nThe Lumières' philosophy was thus based on the realities of a systematic, ordered and understandable world, which required Man also to think in an ordered and systematic way. As well as physical laws, this included ideas on the laws governing human affairs and the divine right of kings, leading to the idea that the monarch acts with the consent of the people, and not the other way around. This legal concept informed Jean-Jacques Rousseau's theory of the social contract as a reciprocal relationship between men, and more so between families and other groups, which would become increasingly stronger, accompanied by a concept of individual inalienable rights. The powers of God were moot amongst atheist Lumières.\n\nThe Lumières movement redefined the ideas of liberty, property and rationalism, which took on meanings that we still understand today, and introduced into political philosophy the idea of the free individual, liberty for all guaranteed by the State (and not the whim of the government) backed by a strong rule of law.\n\nTo understand the interaction between the Age of Reason and the Lumières, one approach is to compare Thomas Hobbes with John Locke. Hobbes, who lived for three quarters of the 17th century, had worked to create an ontology of human emotions, ultimately trying to make order out of an inherently chaotic universe. In the alternate, Locke saw in Nature a source of unity and universal rights, with the State's assurance of protection. This \"culture revolution\" over the 17th and 18th centuries was a battle between these two viewpoints of the relationship between Man and Nature.\n\nThis resulted, in France, in the spread of the notion of human rights, finding expression in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which greatly influenced similar declarations of rights in the following centuries, and left in its wake global political upheaval. Especially in France and the United States, freedom of expression, freedom of religion and freedom of thought were held to be fundamental rights.\n\nThe core values supported by the Lumières were religious tolerance, liberty and social equality.\nIn England, America and France, the application of these values resulted in a new definition of natural law and a separation of political power. To these values may be added a love of nature and the cult of reason.\n\nThe ideal figure of the Lumières was a philosopher, a man of letters with a social function of exercising his reason in all domains to guide his and others' conscience, to advocate a value system and use it in discussing the problems of the time. He is a committed individual, involved in society, an (\"Encyclopédie\"; \"Honest man who approaches everything with reason\"), (Diderot, \"Who concerns himself with revealing error\").\n\nThe rationalism of the Lumières was not to the exclusion of aesthetics. Reason and sentiment went hand-in-hand in their philosophy. The thoughts of the Lumières were equally capable of intellectual rigour and sentimentality.\n\nDespite controversy about the limits of their philosophy, especially when they denounced black slavery, many Lumières criticised slavery, or colonialism, or both, including Montesquieu in \"De l'Esprit des Lois\" (while keeping a \"personal\" slave), Denis Diderot in \"Supplément au voyage de Bougainville\", Voltaire in \"Candide\" and Guillaume-Thomas Raynal in his encyclopaedic \"Histoire des deux Indes\", the very model of 18th-century anticolonialism to which, among others, Diderot and d’Holbach contributed. It was stated without any proof that one of their number, Voltaire, had shares in the slave trade.\n\nAt the time, there was a particular taste for compendia of \"all knowledge\". This ideal found an instance in Diderot and d'Alembert's (\"Encyclopaedia, or Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts\"), usually known simply as the \"Encyclopédie\". Published between 1750 and 1770 it aimed to lead people out of ignorance through the widest dissemination of knowledge.\n\nThe Lumières movement was, for all its existence, pulled in two directions by opposing social forces: on one side, a strong spiritualism accompanied by a traditional faith in the religion of the Church; on the other, the rise of an anticlerical movement, critical of the differences between religious theory and practice, which was most manifest in France.\n\nAnticlericism was not the only source of tension in France: some noblemen contested monarchical power and the upper classes wanted to see greater fruit from their labours. A relaxing of morals fomented opinion against absolutism and the Ancient Order. According to Dale K. Van Kley, Jansenism in France also became a source of division.\n\nThe French judicial system showed itself to be outdated. Even though commercial law had become codified during the 17th century, there was no uniform, or codified, civil law.\n\nThis social and legal background was criticised in works by the likes of Voltaire. Exiled in England between 1726 and 1729, he studied the works of John Locke and Isaac Newton, and the English monarchy. He became well known for his denunciation of injustices such as those against Jean Calas, Pierre-Paul Sirven, François-Jean de la Barre and Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally.\n\nThe Lumières philosophy saw its climax in the middle of the 18th century.\n\nFor Voltaire, it was obvious that if the monarch can get the people to believe unreasonable things, then he can get them to \"do\" unreasonable things. This axiom became the basis for his criticism of the Lumières, and led to the basis of romanticism: that constructions from pure reason created as many problems as they solved.\n\nAccording to the Lumières philosophers, the crucial point of intellectual progress consisted of the synthesis of knowledge, enlightened by human reason, with the creation of a sovereign moral authority. A contrary point of view that developed, arguing that such a process would be swayed by social conventions, leading to a \"New Truth\" based on reason that was but a poor imitation of the ideal and unassailable truth.\n\nThe Lumières movement thus tried to find a balance between the idea of a \"natural\" liberty (or autonomy) and the freedom \"from\" that liberty, that is to say, the recognition that the autonomy found in nature was at odds with the discipline required for pure reason. At the same time, with various monarchs' reforms, there was a piecemeal attempt to redefine the order of society, and the relationship between monarch and subjects. The idea of a natural order was equally prevalent in scientific thought, for example, in the works of the biologist Carl von Linné.\n\nIn Germany, Emmanuel Kant (like Rousseau, defining himself among the Lumières) heavily criticised the limitations of pure reason in his work \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (), but also that of English empiricism in \"Critique of Practical Reason\" (). Compared with the rather subjective metaphysics of Descartes, Kant developed a more objective viewpoint in this branch of philosophy.\n\nGreat thinkers at the end of the Lumières movement (Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson and even the young Goethe) adopted into their philosophy the ideas of self-organising and evolutionary forces. The Lumières' stance was then presented with reference to what was seen as a universal truth: that Good is fundamental in nature, but it is not self-evident. On the contrary, it is the advance of human reason that reveals this constant structure. Romanticism is the exact opposite of this stance.\n\nThis resulted in reflections about urbanism. The Lumières' model town would be a joint effort between public provision and sympathetic architects, to create administrative or utilitarian buildings (town halls, hospitals, theatres, commisariats) all provided with views, squares, fountains, promenades, and so on.\nThe French Académie royale d'architecture was of the opinion that (\"The beautiful is the pleasant\"). For Abbé Laugier, on the contrary, the beautiful was that which was in line with rationality. The natural model for all architecture was the log cabin supported by four tree trunks, with four horizontal parts and a roof, respectively columns, entablature, and pediments. The model of a Greek temple was thus extended into the décor and the structure. This paradigm resulted in a change of style in the middle of the 18th century: Rococo was dismissed, Ancient Greece and Palladian architecture became the principal references for neoclassical architecture.\nThe University of Virginia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was founded by Thomas Jefferson. He drew up plans for parts of the campus based on the values of the Lumières.\n\nThe Place Stanislas at Nancy, France is the focus of an array of neoclassical urban buildings, and has been on the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites in France since 1983, as well as several other sites in the town, such as the Place de la Carrière and the Place d’Alliance, the administrative centre of the time.\n\nClaude Nicolas Ledoux (1736 – 1806) was a member of the Académie d'Architecture was without doubt the architect whose projects best represented the utopian, purely rational environment. (That which is rational, and thus based in the understanding of nature, cannot be at the same time utopian.) Starting in 1775 he built the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, a very industrial city in Doubs.\n\nThe bourgeosie had learned nothing from the Lumières, even though they saw Rousseau, Montesquieu and Kant as honest men who approved of the \"élite\": a vague concept, and one of which the Lumières amongst others disapproved.\n\nThere was considerable coverage in the English and French Press, but less so in Germany and Italy; in Spain and Russia very few knew about it save a few intellectuals, senior officials and grand families participated in the movement. The mass of the people could not care less: the vast majority of the common people, even in France, had never heard of Voltaire or Rousseau.\n\nNevertheless, the Lumières had disrupted the old certainties. This did not stop at social and political upheaval: the Enlightenment inspired a revolutionary generation, which is not to say they explicitly encouraged the French Revolution of 1789.\n\nAs Renaissance humanists, the philosophers of the Lumières movement came with many different talents: Thomas Jefferson had had a legal education but was equally at home with archaeology and architecture; Benjamin Franklin had been a career diplomat and was a physicist. Condorcet wrote on subjects as wide-ranging as commerce, finance, education and science.\n\nThe social origins of the philosophers were also diverse: many were from middle-class families (Voltaire, Jefferson), others from more modest beginnings (Emmanuel Kant, Franklin, Diderot) or from the nobility (Montesquieu, Condorcet). Some had had a religious education (Diderot, Louis de Jaucourt) or one in the law (Montesquieu, Jefferson).\n\nThe philosophers formed networks and communicated in letters; the vitriolic correspondence between Rousseau and Voltaire is well known. The great figures of the 18th century met and debated in the salons, cafés or academies. These thinkers and formed an international community. Franklin, Jefferson, Adam Smith, David Hume and Ferdinando Galiani all spent many years in France.\n\nBecause they criticised the established order, the philosophers were chased by the authorities and had to resort to subterfuge to escape prison. François-Marie Arouet took on the pseudonym Voltaire. In 1774, Thomas Jefferson wrote a report on behalf of the Virginia delegates to the First Continental Congress, which was convened to discuss the grievances of Great Britain's American colonies. Because its content, he could only publish it anonymously. Diderot's (\"Letter on the Blind for the Use of those who can See\") landed him in prison at the Château de Vincennes. Voltaire was accused of writing pamphlets criticising Philippe II, Duke of Orléans (1674–1723), and imprisoned in the Bastille. in 1721, Montesquieu published (\"Persian Letters\") anonymously in Holland. From 1728 to 1734, he went to many European countries.\n\nFaced with censorship and in financial difficulty, the philosophers often resorted to the protection of aristocrats and patrons: Chrétien Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes and Madame de Pompadour, chief mistress of Louis XV, supported Diderot. Marie-Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin (1699 – 1777) paid part of the publishing costs of the \"Encyclopédie\". From 1749 to 1777 she held a fortnightly , inviting artists, intellectuals, men of letters and philosophers. The other great \"salon\" of the time was that of Claudine Guérin de Tencin. In the 1720s, Voltaire exiled himself in England, where he absorbed Locke's ideas.\n\nThe philosophers were, in general, less hostile to monarchical rule than they were to that of the clergy and the nobility. In his defence of Jean Calas, Voltaire defended Royal justice against the excesses of fantastical provincial courts. Many European monarchs – Charles III of Spain, Maria Theresa of the House of Habsburg, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, Catherine II of Russia, Gustave III of Sweden – met with philosophers such as Voltaire, who was presented to the Court of Frederick the Great, and Diderot, who was presented to the Court of Catherine the Great. Philosophers such as d'Holbach were advocates of \"enlightened absolutism\" in the hope that their ideas would spread more quickly if they had the approval of the Head of State. Subsequent events would show the philosophers the limits of such an approach with sovereigns who were , \"more absolutist than enlightened\". Only Rousseau stuck rigidly to the revolutionary ideal of political equality.\n\n\n\nThe spread of literacy and reading allowed the development of what may be called an , \"public space\"; intellectual and political debate was no longer confined to the inner circle of the administrative class and the élite, encompassing larger parts of society. This process of dissemination of new ideas was increased by new methods of communication. Parts of the \"Encyclopédie\", were read by the nobility and the upper class in literary salons, with those present giving their opinions on the writings of philosophers. Newspapers and the postal service allowed a more rapid exchange of ideas throughout Europe, resulting in a new form of cultural unity.\n\nA second important change by the Lumières movement, looking back to the previous century, had its origin in France with the \"Encyclopédistes\". This intellectual movement supported the idea that there was a structural model of both scientific and moral knowledge, that this model was innate and that its expression was a form of human liberation. Starting 1751, Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert published the (\"Systematic Encyclopaedia or Dictionary of Science, Arts and Crafts\"). This raised questions on who should have the liberty to get hold of such information; the Press played an important role in the dissemination of ideas during the French Revolution.\n\nAt first, literary cafés such as the Café Procope in Paris, were the favoured night-time haunt of young poets and critics, who could read and debate, and bragg about their latest success in the theatre or bookshops. But these were eclipsed by (Literary cafés), open to all who had some talent, at least for public speaking. Their defining characteristic was their intellectual mix; men would gather to express their views and satisfy their thirst for knowledge and to establish their world-view. But it was necessary to be \"introduced\" into these salons: received artists, thinkers and philosophers. Each hostess had her day, her speciality and her special guests. The model example is the hotel of Madame de Lambert (Anne-Thérèse de Marguenat de Courcelles) at the turn of the century.\n\nTalented men regularly decamped there to expound their ideas and test their latest work on a privileged public. Worldly and cultured, the \"grandes dames\" who set up these salons enlivened the \"soirées\", encouraging the timid and cutting short arguments. Having strong, relatively liberated personalities, they were often writers and diarists themselves.\n\nThis social mixing was particularly prominent in 18th-century France, in the \"\" (\"General States of Human Spirit\") where the Lumières philosophy flourished. Some cultured women were treated as equal to the men on questions of religion, politics and science, and could bring a certain stylishness to debate, for example the contributions of Anne Dacier to the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, and the works of Émilie du Châtelet.\n\nThe were learned societies which were formed to collate and disseminate works of literature and science. In France, several Royal institutions were set up in the 17th century (the Académie française in 1634; the Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres in 1663; the Académie royale des sciences in 1666; the Académie royale d'architecture in 1671),; other societies were set up in Paris, such as the Académie nationale de médecine in 1731 and the Académie nationale de médecine in 1776. Clergy and, to a lesser extent, nobility formed the majority of the membership.\n\nProvincial societies acted to bond together the intellectual élite of French towns. Their social composition shows that privileged men were less prominent than in Paris: 37% from the nobility, 20% from the Church. Commoners represented the other 43%. Merchants and manufacturers were a small minority (4%).\n\nNeighbouring academies, public libraries and lecture halls flourished, often involving the same enthusiastic men of learning. They were often supported by individual rich men, or funded by public subscription. They collected scientific works, the great dictionaries, had a lecture hall and, nearby, a discussion room.\n\nAll learned societies functioned as open \"salons\" and formed provincial, national and Europe-wide networks, exchanging books and letters, welcoming visiting members, and launching research and teaching programmes in subjects such as physics, chemistry, mineralogy, agronomy, and demography.\n\nIn the British Thirteen Colonies of North America, James Bowdoin (1726–1790), John Adams (1735–1826) and John Hancock (1737–1793) founded the American Academy of Arts and Sciences at Boston during the American War of Independence. In 1743, Benjamin Franklin founded the American Philosophical Society. At the start of the 19th century, Thomas Jefferson had one of the largest private libraries in the country.\n\nOf all the learned societies, the most advanced was that of the Freemasons, although restricted to the upper classes. Having its origin in Great Britain, freemasonry embraced all the characteristics of the Lumières: God-fearing, tolerant, liberal, humanist, aesthetic. It took Europe by storm, where it had thousands of lodged by 1789. In civil, military and even religious walks of life, it did particularly well in becoming part of the State apparatus. Neither anticlerical (which they became in the 19th century) nor revolutionary, masonic lodges helped to expand on philosophical ideas and the spirit of reform in their political strategies. Intellectual discussion took on an esoteric, or sectarian, nature. Masonic lodges, even more than the Academies, emphasised the importance of equality according to ability rather than privilege by birth.\n\nThe spread of ideas of the Lumières relied just as heavily on the actions of travelling traders. As they moved from town to town, they took their ideas and news with them, and could spread it by word of mouth to the illiterate.\n\nThe Press had helped to spread philosophical tracts (notably Diderot and d'Álembert's \"Encyclopédie\"), and encouraged the habit of reflective thought in the populace. In the end, the Press helped form public opinion, in spite of the ever-present censorship. Periodicals included the \"Journal des savants\", also known as the \"Journal des Sçavans\", the \"Mercure de France\", and economic periodicals such as the \"Éphémérides du citoyen\" under Nicolas Baudeau of the \"Économistes\" party and François Quesnay of the \"Physiocrates\". By cataloguing books and with subscriptions to learned societies, a public far from the centre of political activity could keep up with new ideas, discoveries and debates every month, if not every day.\n\nBy the end of the 17th century, John Locke had defined the separation of powers of government as between the executive branch and legislative branch. In \"De l'esprit des lois\" (1748) Montesquieu resurrected the idea of the separation of powers and extended it to include a third power, the judicial branch.\n\nIn the 1750s attempts were made in England, Austria, Prussia and France to \"rationalise\" their monarchs and their laws.\n\nThe \"enlightened\"' () idea of a \"rational\" (or \"systematic\"; ) government was cast into the American Declaration of Independence and, to a lesser extent, in the manifesto of Jacobinism during the French Revolution. It propagated to the United States Constitution of 1787.\n\nThomas Jefferson, a cultured and learned man and one of the original planters of the State of Virginia, was well known to the English philosopher John Locke, and the Genevan Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He presided over the drafting of the Constitution of Virginia in 1776, from which he took certain parts when drafting the American Declaration of Independence, proclaimed on 4 July 1776 at the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. In the summer of 1784, he travelled to Europe to take over the duties of Benjamin Franklin as Ambassador of the United States to France, and during this time he met many of the Lumières, becoming a frequent visitor to literary salons and bookshops in Paris.\n\nThe influence of the Lumières'philosophy is apparent in the Declaration of Independence, with the proclamations that all men are created equal and its opposition to tyranny. The 1787 United States Constitution restates Montesquieu's principle of the separation of powers into legislative, executive and judicial branches, which together form the foundations of modern democracy.\n\nAs the philosophy took hold in the salons, the cafés and the clubs, the absolute rule of the monarch disintegrated, in part because of opposition by the French nobility who saw no future for themselves in reform.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, philosophical ideas informed political debate. The majority of deputies to the National Assembly were from the cultured bourgeois class, who aspired to ideas of liberty and equality. For example, Maximilien de Robespierre was an enthusiastic follower of Rousseau. But most of the French philosophers died before seeing their seedlings planted during the Revolution bear fruit, with the exception of Nicolas de Condorcet, Louis Sébastien Mercier and Abbé Raynal. The first two of these three Girondists fell out of favour; only the third came out with honour, even, after his death in 1796, having a bust made in honour of his essays on the abolition of black slavery, on 4 February 1794 (in the Gregorian calendar; 16 pluviôse of year II in the French Republican Calendar). He was also the uncle of a , Simon Camboulas.\n\nThe French Revolution in particular represents a violent application of the Lumières' philosophy, especially during the Reign of Terror, the interregnum of the Jacobins. Descartes characterised the desire for a \"rational\" and \"spiritual\" revolution as one that aimed to eradicate the Church, and Christianity, entirely.\n\nThe National Convention revoked the French Republican Calendar, the system of measurement of time, and the system of currency, while making the goal of equality, both social and economic, the highest priority of the State.\n\n\n"}

(Mary) Louise Baker (1872 – 1962) was an American archaeological illustrator, resident artist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (1908-1936), and an art teacher at the George School. \n\nMary Louise Baker was born on August 4, 1872, in Alliance, Ohio. In 1892, at the age of 19, she struck out on her own, first to Chester County, Pennsylvania, where she completed her education and taught primary school, and then on to Philadelphia, where in 1900 she enrolled in the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art. She won several awards for her designs and illustrations and was awarded a scholarship. In 1902, M. Louise Baker secured a job from C.B. Moore, restoring pottery and drawing illustrations for his popular \"oversized, well-illustrated volumes\" published by the Academy of Natural Sciences. In 1903, she obtained a teaching position at the George School, a Quaker boarding school near Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. In 1908, she was hired as a part-time illustrator by the archaeologist George Byron Gordon, then the General Curator of American Archaeology, at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, where she worked as the Museum Artist until 1936. She worked as an archaeological illustrator, did illustrations for Museum publications and exhibits, restoration work, and also made models and replicas. \n\nBaker wrote and illustrated stories and poems for children throughout her career, and published illustrations in the \"Children's Page\" of the \"Youth's Companion Magazine\" and other magazines for children. Baker also led groups of women on summer tours of European museums. \n\nDuring the First World War, between 1919 and 1920, Baker served with the American Friends Service Committee in France, where she ran an Embroidery Depot for refugees at Verdun and Clermont-en-Argonne, in northeast France near the Belgian border. In August, 1920, she returned to Philadelphia with E. Constance Allen, of Dublin, Ireland. The two had a life-long relationship and worked together at the George School.\n\nM. Louise Baker undertook her first work for the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in 1908 on the Museum's Nubian pottery collection. This work was at the request of David Randall-MacIver, who was then the director of the Museum’s Nubian expedition. She earned $80 a month. These illustrations were subsequently published in Leonard Woolley and David Randall-MacIver's reports on \"Karanôg: the Romano-Nubian cemetery\" (1910) and \"Buhen\" (1911). \n\nBaker's work at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology attracted wider notice, leading many \"other ... archaeologists, who had only seen examples of her published work, [to] request... her participation in future efforts.\" Baker worked in pen and ink, charcoal and watercolor. Her three-dimensional and trompe-l'œil water colors and 'roll out' illustrations of ceramic vessels were particularly admired as \"both scientifically valuable and also exquisite art.\"\n\nIn 1931, M. Louise Baker traveled to New Orleans, where she painted Maya material at Tulane University’s Middle American Research Institute. Next she traveled to Mérida, Yucatán, in Mexico, and painted and drew Maya pottery in the State Museum and private collections. Next she traveled to Guatemala City, Guatemala, to make ink and watercolor illustrations of pots from the Carnegie Institution of Washington expedition to Uaxactun and from Cobán, held in the private collection of Erwin Paul Dieseldorff. Her paintings and illustrations of Maya pottery were subsequently published by the University of Pennsylvania Museum between 1925 and 1943 in several volumes of \"Examples of Maya Pottery in the Museum and Other Collections\"; several others appeared in the second volume of E.P. Dieseldorff’s \"Kunst und Religion der Mayavölker\" (1931). Still others have been more recently reproduced.\n\nIn 1932, Baker traveled to the British Museum in London, England, and then on to Baghdad, Iraq, to paint materials held there from the Joint Expedition of the Penn Museum and British Museumto Mesopotamia. Leonard Woolley served as the excavation director for the Expedition, which uncovered the Royal Tombs of Ur. \n\nDuring her return from Iraq, Baker visited museums and private collections in Germany, Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and England to add to her illustrations of Maya ceramics.\n\nM. Louise Baker left the Penn Museum in 1936 when, owing to her failing eyesight, she had difficultly producing illustrations. She retired from the George School two years later, in 1939, together with E. Constance Allen, who was dean there from 1925 to 1938. Baker and Allen purchased a home together in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. For the next ten years, Baker taught classes on writing and illustration, carpentry, furniture making, metal working, and ceramics. She also gave talks on local and Quaker history and her archaeological adventures, acted in amateur theater productions in Chester County, and led tours to European museums. \n\nBaker suffered eye problems ranging from cataracts to glaucoma throughout her life. Doctors hit upon the idea of applying leeches to her temples to alleviate her symptoms.\n\nShe was completely blind by 1949. Baker and E. Constance Allen spent their final years together at The Hickman, a Quaker retirement home in West Chester, Pennsylvania. M. Louise Baker died in her ninetieth year on July 15th, 1962.\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n"}

In 1571, he was forced to flee his homeland for Naples when he became involved in a plot for an uprising against the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of the Battle of Lepanto.\n\nAt Naples, he changed his name to Melissenos, echoing the Byzantine aristocratic family, and produced several works. Among them was a list of the bishops of Monemvasia, a history and description of the city, and a list of members of the Melissenos family. He also collaborated with Andreas Darmarios to produce the \"Chronicon Majus\" (1573–75), an expanded revision of George Sphrantzes' \"Chronicon Minus\" with additional material from George Akropolites, Nikephoros Gregoras, and other writers (whence he is also called Pseudo-Sphrantzes). Covering the period 1258 to 1477, it is an important historical source, particularly for his eyewitness account of the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, although doubts regarding the authenticity of his material remain. Earlier scholarship believed that Melissenos was also responsible for forging a chrysobull ascribed to Emperor Andronikos II with the intention of legitimizing increased powers for himself as metropolitan. However, this position has more recently been challenged by Haris Kalligas, who has reevaluated the evidence and dates the bull as authentic to 1314. Makarios Melissenos died at Naples in 1585.\n"}

In the Mbombo creation myth, Mbombo was a giant in form and white in color. The myth describes the creation of the universe from nothing.\nThe story of Mbombo's creation tells that in the beginning, Mbombo was alone, darkness and primordial water covered all the earth. It would happen that Mbombo came to feel an intense pain in his stomach, and then Mbombo vomited the sun, the moon, and stars. The heat and light from the sun evaporated the water covering the earth, creating clouds, and after time, the dry hills emerged from the water. Then Mbombo vomited once more, bringing forth nine animals: the leopard, called Koy Bumba; the eagle, Ponga Bumba; the crocodile, Ganda Bumba; the fish, Yo Bumba; the tortoise, Kono Bumba; a black leopard-like animal, Tsetse Bumba; a white heron, Nyanyi Bumba; a scarab; and a goat named Budi. Mbombo also vomited many men, one of them was called Loko Yima and was white like Bumba. \n\nThese nine animals went on to create all the world's creatures. The heron created all flying birds but one, the kite, and the crocodile created snakes and the iguana. The goat, Budi, brought forth all the horned animals, the scarab all insects, and Yo Bumba, all fish.\n\nThree of Mbombo's sons then said they would finish creating the world. The first to try, Nyonye Ngana, vomited white ants, but died after. To honor him, the ants went deep in the earth for dark soil to bury him and transformed the barren sands at the earth's surface. The second, Chonganda, created the first plant, which in turn gave rise to all trees, grasses and flowers. And Chedi Bumba, the third son, made the last bird, the kite. \n\nTsetse Bumba caused trouble on the earth so Mbombo chased her into the sky where she became the thunderbolt. This left people without fire, so Mbombo showed them how to make it from trees. Once the creation was complete and peaceful, Mbombo delivered it to mankind and retreated into the heavens, leaving Loko Yima to serve as \"god upon the earth\". The woman of the waters, Nchienge, lived in the East, and her son, Woto, became the first king of the Kuba.\n\n\n"}

In 1950, the \"Japhetic theory\" fell from official favour, with Joseph Stalin denouncing it as anti-Marxist.\n\nMarr was born in Kutaisi, Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire), in the family of the Scot James Murray (phonetically adapted: Marr) (aged 71) who founded the botanical garden of the city, and a young Georgian woman (Agrafina Magularia).

Although the languages undergo certain stages of development, his method of \"linguistic paleontology\" claims to make it possible to discern elements of primordial exclamations in any given language.

She was the first child of Segundo Astorga, a lumber exporter and rancher with connections to the powerful ruling Somoza familyand his wife, Mierrel Gadea. In her youth she was a devout Roman Catholic, often doing charitable work in the poor neighborhoods of Managua.\n\nIn 1967, Astorga announced to her family's dismay that she supported Fernando Agüero, not his opponent Anastasio Somoza Debayle, in the presidential election. For her personal safety and to \"straighten her out,\" her family sent her to study medicine in the United States, where she remained from 1967 to 1969. However, the animal dissections disturbed her and she had to abandon her studies. She said of the years she spent in Washington, D.C., \"What impressed me most about the United States were the social contrasts and above all the racism. I had never seen racism like that in Nicaragua ... [m]y political consciousness was born then.\"\n\nAstorga married Jorge Jenkins when she was 22. Astorga had four children, two with her husband, two with Jose Maria Alvarado, a member of the Sandinistas.\n\nAstorga later returned to Nicaragua and studied law at the Universidad Centroamericana in Managua. Her association with Nicaragua's Sandinista revolutionaries began during her years as a university student. From 1969 to 1973, she was responsible for finding safe houses and transportation for the revolutionary leader Oscar Turcios.\n\nAt age 22, she married Jorge Jenkins, a student activist. The young couple spent the following year in Italy, where he studied anthropology, and she studied banking law and computer programming. They had two children and separated after five years of marriage. During this time, Astorga led a double life as a mother of two and a corporate lawyer for one of Nicaragua's largest construction companies, while clandestinely aiding the Sandinistas.\n\nAfter the assassination of newspaper editor Pedro Chamorro in 1978, Astorga decided to take up arms against the Somoza regime. \"I finally understood that armed struggle was the only solution, that a rifle cannot be met with a flower, that we were in the streets, but if that force didn't get organized we wouldn't achieve much\", she said. \"For me, it was the moment of conviction: either I took up arms and made a total commitment or I wasn't going to change anything.\"\n\nShe gained national attention for her participation in the botched kidnapping and murder of General Reynaldo Pérez Vega (nicknamed \"El Perro,\" or \"the dog\"). Pérez Vega was deputy commander of Anastasio Somoza’s National Guard. On March 8, 1978, Astorga invited the general to her apartment in Managua, hinting to him that the sexual favors he had long sought would be granted. When he arrived, however, three members of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) — Hilario Sánchez, Raúl Venerio and Walter Ferreti — burst out of her bedroom closet and seized the general. The plan was to ransom him for jailed Sandinista revolutionaries, but Pérez Vega put up a struggle and was murdered. Later, with his throat slit, he was found wrapped in a Sandinista flag. Astorga said of his murder, \"It was not murder. He was too much of a monster.\"\n\nIn an interview shortly before her death, she described her feelings about her role in the Pérez Vega murder this way:\n\nShe became the subject of a national manhunt and next appeared to the Nicaraguan public on the pages of \"La Prensa\", the nation's opposition newspaper. She was wearing jungle fatigues and carrying an AK-47 assault rifle. Astorga had escaped to the jungle and joined the Sandinista revolutionaries. There, she became pregnant with her third child by José María Alvarado, a leading Sandinista.\n\nAfter the Sandinistas took power in July 1979, Astorga was appointed Vice Minister of Justice. In that position she oversaw the trials of some 7,500 members of Somoza's National Guard.\n\nIn 1984, her appointment as ambassador to the United States was refused by the Reagan administration because of her involvement in the killing of General Reynaldo Pérez Vega. Vega had been a CIA operative.\n\nAstorga became a deputy representative to the United Nations in 1984, and in March 1986, became the Nicaraguan ambassador to that body, a position she held until her death in 1988. She was instrumental in getting the United Nations to recognize a ruling by the International Court of Justice, \"Nicaragua v. United States\", that declared the United States' support for the Contras illegal.\n\nOn February 14, 1988, \"La Norita\" died of cervical cancer in Managua, aged 39. She was awarded the title \"Hero of the Fatherland and Revolution\" and the Order of Carlos Fonseca on July 1987, which was the highest order of Nicaragua at the time.\n\nShe appears as one of the twelve apostles in the mural of the Visitación at Casa Ave Maria in Managua. A barrio, or neighborhood, in Managua was named for her.\n\nThe 1986 song \"Mariel\" by the KBC Band was inspired by Nora Astorga.

Heidegger agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously. It was published five days after his death, on 31 May 1976. It is translated by William J. Richardson into English.\n\nIn the interview, Heidegger defended his entanglement with National Socialism in two ways: first, he argued that there was no alternative, saying that he was trying to save the university (and science in general) from being politicized and thus had to compromise with the Nazi administration. Second, he admitted that he saw an \"awakening\" (\"Aufbruch\") which might help to find a \"new national and social approach,\" but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, largely prompted by the violence of the Night of the Long Knives.\n\nIn his interview Heidegger defended as double-speak his 1935 lecture describing the \"inner truth and greatness of this movement.\" He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by \"movement\" he meant National Socialism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was no eulogy for the NSDAP. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthesis that he did not read out yet claimed in the interview was present from the beginning (and included in his \"Introduction to Metaphysics\" (1953)), namely, \"the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity.\"\n\nThe Löwith account from 1936 has been cited to contradict the account given in the \"Der Spiegel\" interview in two ways: that he did not make any decisive break with National Socialism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement. The \"Der Spiegel\" interviewers did not bring up Heidegger's 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps. In fact, the interviewers were not in possession of much of the evidence now known for Heidegger's Nazi sympathies.\n\n\n"}

The real name is Islam. That means peace,\" as well as \"I believe in Allah and in peace\"\n\nIn 1996, the Organisation of The Islamic Conference agreed to call for \"pragmatic and constructive steps to counter the negative propaganda against Islam; to remove and rectify misunderstandings; and to present the true image of Islam: the religion of peace and tolerance.\"\n\nIn September 2001, in the wake of the September 11 attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush said: \"The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war.\" Some have pointed out that the word \"Islam\" is etymologically related to the Arabic word \"salām\" meaning \"peace\". This prompted criticism from some quarters and a poll of United States Evangelical Protestant leaders taken in 2002 revealed that only 10% agreed with Bush that Islam was synonymous with peace.\n\nMahathir bin Mohamad, the former Prime Minister of Malaysia said in 2002, \"Islam, as I said, is a religion of peace. However through the centuries, deviations from the true teachings of Islam take place. And so [people who call themselves] \"Muslims\" kill despite the injunction of their religion against killing especially of innocent people.\n\nDalil Boubakeur, \"mufti\" of the Paris Mosque, said in 2006, \"The prophet did not found a terrorist religion, but a religion of peace.\"\n\nFollowing the 2015 San Bernardino attack, US President Barack Obama used the term, as part of his efforts to counter a perceived anti-Muslim bias, in an address following the attack, and in his first visit to a US mosque.\n\nOn March 18th, 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Islam a religion of peace and called terrorism a dividing force, lauding the peaceful message of Sufism, at World Sufi Conference.\n\nSherman Jackson says that the expression does not imply a rejection of the laws of Jihad, but rather the idea that Islam desires a \"a state of permanent, peaceful coexistence with other nations and peoples who are not Muslims\".\n\nThe term \"The Religion of Peace\" is used mockingly by critics of Islam, such as right-wing commentator Ann Coulter. Philosopher and New Atheist writer Sam Harris wrote, \"The position of the Muslim community in the face of all provocations seems to be: Islam is a religion of peace, and if you say that it isn't, we will kill you.\"\n\nWhen asked by reporters in 2005 if Islam was a religion of peace, Pope Benedict XVI stated that some elements of Islam can favor peace, but it also has other elements. \nIslamist Sayyid Qutb wrote that Islam is the religion of peace in the sense of submitting all of mankind to Allah.\n\nOn May 13, 2015, ISIL released an audio message by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who asserted that Islam is not a religion of peace, but rather the religion of fighting.\nFollowing the 2017 Barcelona attacks, the cover of \"Charlie Hebdo\" ran with an image of a van driving away from bloodied victims with the caption \"Islam, religion of peace...

{"id": "52024946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52024946", "title": "Seventh World Congress of the Comintern", "text": "Seventh World Congress of the Comintern\n\nThe 7th World Congress of the Communist International (Comintern) was a multinational conference held in Moscow from July 25 through August 20, 1935 by delegated representatives of ruling and non-ruling communist parties from around the world and invited guests representing other political and organized labor organizations. The gathering was attended by 513 delegates, of whom 371 were accorded full voting rights, representing 65 Comintern member parties as well as 19 sympathizing parties.\n\nThe gathering is best remembered for its endorsement of a Popular Front of communist and non-communist forces against the growing menace of fascism in Europe, paving the way for advocacy of collective security between the Soviet Union and the various capitalist states of Europe. This marked a dramatic reversal of the Comintern's previous orientation towards class warfare endorsed by the 6th World Congress of 1928, the aggressive line of the so-called \"Third Period.\"\n\nThroughout the early 1930s the Soviet Union's People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, headed by Maxim Litvinov, had pursued a policy of attempting to win a broad international agreement to bring about military disarmament. This initiative had clearly reached a terminal impasse from the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, however, with the new political reality writ large by the October 1933 departure of Nazi Germany from the Geneva disarmament negotiations.\n\nStill, there was little motion among the world communist movement towards construction of a broader united front with the socialist movement and their affiliated trade unions, with the Comintern continuing to train its rhetorical guns on the social democratic movement, which was held to have sabotaged the effort of the Communist Party of Germany to wage battle against fascism by propagating what the communists characterized as its \"anti-Marxist theory of a 'peaceful,' 'democratic' road to socialism\" among the German workers' movement.\n\nThere were some within the communist movement who began feeling their way to a new more collaborative orientation, however. The February 1934 Uprising of Socialists against right wing forces in Austria and movement towards cooperation between Socialists and Communists in France in fighting a nascent fascist movement there convinced Bulgarian Communist Georgi Dimitrov, a leading figure in the Communist International that the Comintern's hostility towards joint action between Communists and Socialists was ill considered. Dimitrov made his triumphant return to Moscow in April 1934 following acquittal in the Reichstag Fire trial determined to change the Comintern's fundamental strategy from one of antagonistic opposition to social democracy to one of cooperation in a joint struggle.\n\nPreparations for a 7th World Congress of the Comintern began in Moscow late in 1934, with the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) establishing a commission to draft programmatic resolutions for that body. This body was divided between Dimitrov and others advocating a move towards a \"general democratic, anti-Fascist\" orientation and hardliners who continued to argue that the battle against fascism was inseparable from the task of overthrowing the bourgeoisie, implying a simultaneous fight against the fascist right and the reformist constitutionalist and socialist movements. With no rapid agreement forthcoming, on March 8, 1935 the scheduled opening of the 7th Congress was moved back to the end of July.\n\nIt would be the exigencies of Soviet foreign policy which ultimately shaped the Comintern's orientation, when on May 2, 1935, the two countries most concerned about the implications of growing German militarism — France and the Soviet Union — concluded the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance, a mutual aid pact in which each promised to come to the other's defense in the event that aggression violating the Covenant of the League of Nations was suffered. Shortly thereafter, two days of consultations in Moscow between French Foreign Minister Pierre Laval and Soviet chiefs Joseph Stalin, Viacheslav Molotov, and Maxim Litvinov helped to solemnify the agreement through a joint communique in which the parties agreed \"not to allow their means of national defense to weaken in any respect\" and which recognized France's right to \"maintain her armed forces at a level consonant with her security.\"\n\nThe May 1935 treaty and formal communique between France and the USSR tilted the scale decisively towards a new Comintern policy for the Communist Parties of the world, casting aside the old Third Period line of \"class against class\" for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie in favor of a new policy of \"realpolitik,\" defending the Russian revolution by supporting mutual defense agreements between the USSR and various capitalist states. Further marking this shift in the international political line of the Comintern was the appointment of Popular Front adherent Georgi Dimitrov as new head of the Communist International. The stage was therefore set for the belated convocation of the Comintern's 7th World Congress.\n\nThe 7th World Congress of the Communist International opened ion the evening of July 25, 1935 in the Hall of Pillars of the House of the Unions in Moscow. The gathering, which was convened almost exactly seven years since the conclusion of the last Comintern World Congress, was attended by 513 delegates, of whom 371 were accorded full voting rights, representing 65 Comintern member parties as well as 19 sympathizing parties. In keeping with his personal tradition and relative lack of interest in Comintern affairs, the proceedings were not attended by All-Union Communist Party General Secretary Joseph Stalin, who had by this time risen to a position of unquestioned supremacy in the Soviet firmament.\n\nDespite his absence, Stalin was lauded in a cult-like manner, with every mention of the Soviet leader's name being met by \"tumultuous applause\" from the gathered delegates.\n\nSetting the stage for the 7th World Congress was the keynote report on the Activities of ECCI, delivered on the second day by Wilhelm Pieck of the Communist Party of Germany. While lauding the 1928 tactic of \"class against class\" which was \"directed against the bloc of the Social Democrats with the bourgeoisie and aimed at destroying the bloc of the Social Democratic leaders with the bourgeoisie,\" Pieck nevertheless acknowledged that \"a certain number of sectarian mistakes were committed.\" This push for ideologically pure leadership divided the workers' movement during the strike movement of the late 1920s, gaining the support of some workers while alienating others and ultimately failing owing to \"clumsy and sectarian tactics.\"\n\nPieck argued that with the coming of the Great Depression the bourgeoisie sought to solve its problem of a collapsing internal market and declining profits with a move towards seizure and plunder of foreign territory under the banner of fascism, with the aggression of militarist Japan in Manchuria and the rise of Nazi Germany said to epitomize the new trend. \"These preparations are simultaneously and primarily designed for the destruction of the Soviet Union, the home, the basis, and the bulwark of the proletarian revolution,\" Pieck declared.\n\nPieck identified the \"defeat of the German proletariat\" and the rise of Nazism as the \"greatest event that marked the first years of the crisis in the capitalist countries,\" stating that from the spring of 1932 it had \"already become evident that the fascists had a considerable advantage over the Communists in the matter of mobilizing the masses. The communists had attempted to change the situation by proposing a united front with the Social Democratic Party of Germany and its associated trade union federation, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund (ADGB). This effort had been rebuffed, Pieck said, with the failure of the Social Democratic political and labor movement to join general strikes following the expulsion of socialist ministers from the government of Prussia in July 1932 and the coming to power of the Hitler government in January 1933 singled out for specific criticism.\n\nOmitting the fact that the Comintern's \"class against class\" line had been targeted directly at the Social Democrats, who had been castigated as \"social fascists\" in no way better than the actual fascist movement, Pieck declared that the Communists had done \"everything in their power to mobilize the laboring masses for a revolutionary struggle to prevent the fascist dictatorship,\" only to be stymied when the Social Democrats \"did not abandon their hostile attitude to the united front and the struggle.\" Only now, Pieck declared, had a new era been ushered in with a \"turn of the Socialist workers towards a united front with the Communists.\"\n\nA variety of factors had contributed to the new attitude of the Socialists towards the Communists, according to Pieck, including the \"final and irrevocable victory of socialism in the Soviet Union\" on the one hand and the brutal reality of fascist dictatorship in Germany on the other. The defense of Communism made by Dimitrov at the Leipzig trial, a general strike in France in February 1934, and armed battles against the fascists in Austria in February 1934 and in Spain in October 1934 had further consolidated this trend towards interparty cooperation, Pieck declared. Consequently, Pieck noted, \"United Front agreements have been reached between the Communists and Socialists in Austria, Spain, and Italy\" with additional mass actions taking place between rank-and-file party members without the blessing of Socialist leaders in Great Britain, the United States, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.\n\nAfter Pieck's keynote report and the extended discussion which ensued came on August 2 a second watershed report, this by Georgi Dimitrov on the task of building unity of the working class in opposition to fascism. The appearance of Dimitrov on the platform, a great hero of the communist movement since his victory at the Leipzig trial, was met by a resounding ovation of the gathered delegates and a rousing singing of \"The Internationale.\"\n\nDimitrov began with an analysis of fascism, which he characterized as \"the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, most chauvinistic, and most imperialist elements of finance capital,\" intent upon wreaking organized \"terrorist vengeance against the working class and the revolutionary section of the peasantry and intelligentsia.\" With respect to its foreign policy, Dimitrov condemned fascism as \"jingoism in its most brutal form, fomenting bestial hatred of other nations.\"\n\nIn marked juxtaposition to the previous international communist line, which intentionally muddied the difference between \"fascism\" and \"social fascism\" in an effort to break common workers away from their social democratic political and trade union leadership, Dimitrov depicted the establishment of fascism as a definite break in the fundamental form of governance from \"one state form of class domination of the bourgeoisie — bourgeois democracy — by another form — open terrorist dictatorship.\" Fascism's victory would suppression of the \"democratic liberties of the working people,\" curtail \"the rights of parliament,\" and intensify repression of the revolutionary movement, Dimitrov warned.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46849992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46849992", "title": "Shelburne riots", "text": "Shelburne riots\n\nThe Shelburne riots were a series of mob attacks in July 1784 by landless British Loyalist veterans of the American Revolution against Black Loyalists and government officials in the town of Shelburne, Nova Scotia, Canada and the nearby village of Birchtown. They are considered the first race riots in Canada and one of the first recorded race riots in North America.\n\nThe town of Shelburne was created in 1783 as a settlement for United Empire Loyalists, British soldiers, supporters and families who fought for the British in the American Revolution. Briefly the fourth largest city in North America and the largest British city in the continent, the city of 10,000 people included over 1,500 African Americans known as Black Loyalists who had escaped slavery during the American Revolution and joined the British side. Black Loyalists were given land in Birchtown six miles outside town but many also worked and lived in Shelburne. Tensions rose in Shelburne in the spring of 1784. Delays in awarding land grants created anger and frustration among many disbanded soldiers who sought jobs while they waited for grants promised for their military service. They found many Black Loyalists, who received even fewer land grants and smaller rations, were willing to work for smaller wages.\n\nA popular Black clergyman David George became a lightning rod for racist anger. He founded a Baptist church in Shelburne and attracted many followers, both black and white. In the spring of 1784, as David George prepared to baptize a white couple, William and Deborah Holmes, a small mob of Deborah Holmes's relatives disrupted the service to stop her baptism. Shelburne magistrates were called and ruled that the couple were free to be baptised in a church of their choosing. The baptism went ahead but racial tension grew among landless white Loyalists.\n\nOn the night of July 25, the riot began as a large group of men attacked David George and the Black Loyalists in Shelburne.\n\nDavid George's home and 20 other homes of free Blacks in Shelburne were destroyed in the first night of rioting. Many of the free Blacks fled to Birchtown for safety. George stayed and continued to preach in Shelburne but at his next service a number of white rioters stormed into the church and threatened him. The next day they attacked him, beating him with sticks until he escaped into swampy area outside of Shelburne. He returned at night to rescue his wife and children and they sought shelter in Birchtown along with most of the free Blacks who had formerly lived and worked in Shelburne.\n\nThe Loyalist land agent in Shelburne Benjamin Marston wrote after the first day of rioting, \"Great Riot today. The disbanded soldiers have risen against the free negroes to drive them out of town because they labour more cheaply.\" The next day the rioters attacked Marston's house. He escaped to the military barracks across the harbour and that afternoon was able to board a coastal schooner headed for Halifax shortly before rioters arrived at the barracks reportedly planning to hang him. Attacks by rioters continued in town for ten days targeting some white Loyalists, such as Thomas and James Courtney who had received large land grants on the Roseway River to set up a sawmill. The Courtneys were wealthy enough to hire armed guards to protect their homes.\n\nAttacks continued for another month against Black Loyalists as rioters made incursions against the Black settlement at Birchtown. Black Loyalists, many of whom were army veterans organized into militia companies, were able to defend themselves in Birchtown initially, but as the riots continued the militias were no longer able to quell the violence. Attacks on Blacks traveling along the road between Birchtown and Shelburne for work and supplies continued for a month. Reports of the attacks spread around Nova Scotia with Simeon Perkins in the town of Liverpool to the east writing, \"An extraordinary mob or riot has happened at Shelburne. Some thousands of people assembled Clubs and Drove the Negroes out of the Town.\" The mob was stopped by the arrival of troops from the 17th Regiment of Foot, later assisted by a frigate.\n\nDozens of homes, mostly of Black Loyalists, had been destroyed in the riots while others were looted. An unknown number of people were injured. No deaths were recorded. Most rioters limited themselves to injuring and terrifying their victims and few rioters had access to firearms. Free Blacks had essentially been driven out of the town of Shelburne, firmly establishing the two as a segregated white community aside from Blacks slaves and indentured servants. Black Loyalists were forced to seek a livelihood in the poor lands and overcrowded settlement of Birchtown.\n\nThe Governor of Nova Scotia, John Parr also traveled to Shelburne on August 23 to attempt to settle the disputes and delays in land grants. Parr blamed the riot on delays in awarding land. He blamed Martson, calling him \"a shark trying to prey on helpless settlers\". Marston was dismissed from his post. None of the rioters who attacked the Black Loyalists or Marston were identified or brought to justice. However, when a fresh round of attacks led to assaults against some Mi'kmaq people at Shelburne in November, the ringleader Edward Cavan was put in the stocks and sentenced to six months in prison.\n\nDespite the eventual settlement of Loyalist land grants in 1785, the economy of Shelburne collapsed in the late 1780s as a lack of agricultural land, a collapse of the whale fishery and poor inland trade routes led four fifths of the population to leave. This included David George and many of the Black Loyalists who fled the racism and poverty of Shelburne in 1792 to settle in Freetown, Sierra Leone where they became known as The Nova Scotian Settlers.\n\nScholars such as James Walker have interpreted the riots as caused by the economic predicaments of the Loyalists which aggravated racial hostility. Marston is regarded by many scholars as a scapegoat for the larger problems of Loyalist land settlements and racism.\n\nThe Shelburne riots were dramatized in the BBC docudrama series \"Rough Crossings\" based on the book by Simon Schama. The riots are also depicted in fiction in the novel \"The Book of Negroes\" by Lawrence Hill and the television miniseries of the same name, although the date of the riot is changed in both works to fit the fictional narrative and the riots are depicted as a mass lynching with hangings, multiple murders and a church burning.\n\n"}

Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.\n\nGenerally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: \"Kameny zmizelých\", stones of the disappeared.\n\nThe Jewish community of Lomnice u Tišnova existed since the beginning of the 18th century. But already in 1571 a ″certain Jew″ from Lomnice was mentioned, the first written evidence of the existence of Jewish population in the city. While in the 16th and 17th century there were only few Jews coming to Lomnice, this changed at the beginning of the 18th century. 708 Jews from Lysice were resettled in Lomnice. A first Jewish community with a prayer hall was established. Around 1800 about 80 Jewish families lived in Lomnice with about 611 persons, that was then at least half the inhabitants. In the first half of the 19th century there was also a Yeshiva, a Jewish university in the city. In 1830, the community consisted of 606 persons, more than a third of the population. Thereafter the Jewish portion of the population decreased continuously: in 1848 only 306 (20%), in 1900 merely 88 people (5%), 1930 only 30 persons (2%). A rabbi was active here until 1919. In 1929, der Jewish community was finally dissolved. After the destruction of Czechoslovakia and the German occupation, about 35 Jews from other municipalities in the region sought refuge in Lomnice. Already in autumn of 1941, however, their property was confiscated, their freedom of movement was restricted. Deportations were carried out between December 1941 and April 1942. The first transport took place on 5 December 1941 (Transport K), the last and largest from Brno on 4 April 1942 (transport Ah). The oldest person on this train was Mrs. Schiller, 86 years old, the youngest was Libuška Tuliss, not even three years old. After the war, only one Jew, Jan Líbezný, returned to Lomnice. He had lost all his relatives in Nazi concentration camps. On the occasion of the reopening of the Lomnic Synagogue in 1997, a memorial plaque for 58 victims of the Shoah was unveiled. On 17 September 2011, the first collocation of Stolpersteine took place. They were dedicated to the Liebesny family.\n\nThe Stolpersteine in Lomnice were collocated by the artist himself on the following dates:\n\nThe Czech Stolperstein project was initiated in 2008 by the \"Česká unie židovské mládeže\" (Czech Union of Jewish Youth) and was realized with the patronage of the Mayor of Prague.\n\n\n"}

The division on ancient and medieval periods is less sharp or absent in the Arabic and Asian historiographies. A synoptic view of universal history led some scholars, beginning with Karl Jaspers, to distinguish the Axial Age synchronous to \"classical antiquity\" of the Western tradition. Jaspers also proposed a more universal periodization—prehistory, history and planetary history. All distinguished earlier periods belong to the second period (history) which is a relatively brief transitory phase between two much longer periods.\n\nThe roots of historiography in the 19th century are bound up with the concept that history written with a strong connection to the primary sources could be integrated with \"the big picture\", i.e. to a general, universal history. For example, Leopold von Ranke, probably the pre-eminent historian of the 19th century, founder of Rankean historical positivism, the classic mode of historiography that now stands against postmodernism, attempted to write a Universal History at the close of his career. The works of world historians Oswald Spengler and Arnold J. Toynbee are examples of attempts to integrate primary source-based history and Universal History. Spengler's work is more general; Toynbee created a theory that would allow the study of \"civilizations\" to proceed with integration of source-based history writing and Universal History writing. Both writers attempted to incorporate teleological theories into general presentations of the history. Toynbee found as the \"telos\" (\"goal\") of universal history the emergence of a single World State.\n\nA project of Universal history may be seen in the Hebrew Bible, \nwhich from the point of view of its redactors in the 5th century BC presents a history of humankind from creation to the Flood, \nand from there a history of the Israelites down to the present. The Seder Olam is a 2nd-century CE rabbinic interpretation of this chronology.\n\nIn Greco-Roman antiquity, the first universal history was written by Ephorus (fl. 4th century BC). This work has been lost, but its influence can be seen in the ambitions of Polybius (203–120 BC) and Diodorus (fl. 1st century BC) to give comprehensive accounts of their worlds. Herodotus' \"History\" is the earliest surviving member of the Greco-Roman world-historical tradition, although under some definitions of universal history it does not qualify as universal because it reflects no attempt to describe an overall direction of history or a principle or set of principles governing or underlying it. Polybius was the first to attempt a universal history in this stricter sense of the term:\n\n\"Metamorphoses\" by Ovid has been considered as a universal history because of its comprehensive chronology—from the creation of mankind to the death of Julius Caesar a year before the poet's birth. In Leipzig are preserved five fragments dating to the 2nd century AD and coming from a world chronicle. Its author is unknown, but was perhaps a Christian. Later, universal history provided an influential lens on the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire in such works as Eusebius's \"Ecclesiastical History\", Augustine's \"City of God\", and Orosius' \"History Against the Pagans\".\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE) of China, Sima Qian (145–86 BC) was the first Chinese historian to attempt a universal history—from the earliest mythological origins of his civilization to his present day—in his \"Records of the Grand Historian\". Although his generation was the first in China to discover the existence of kingdoms in Central Asia and India, his work did not attempt to cover the history of these regions.\n\nThe \"universal chronicle\" traces history from the beginning of the world up to the present and was an especially popular genre of historiography in medieval Western Europe. The universal chronicle differs from the ordinary chronicle in its much broader chronological and geographical scope, giving, in principle, a continuous account of the progress of world history from the creation of the world up to the author's own times, but in practice often narrowing down to a more limited geographical range as it approaches those times.\n\nThe \"Chronica\" of Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 275–339) is considered to be the starting point of this tradition. The second book of this work consisted of a set of concordance tables (\"Chronici canones\") that for the first time synchronized the several concurrent chronologies in use with different peoples. Eusebius' chronicle became known to the Latin West through the translation by Jerome (c. 347–420).\n\nUniversal chronicles are sometimes organized around a central ideological theme, such as the Augustinian idea of the tension between the heavenly and the earthly state, as depicted in the City of God, which plays a major role in Otto von Freising's \"Historia de duabus civitatibus\". Agustine’s thesis depicts the history of the world as universal warfare between God and the Devil. This metaphysical war is not limited by time but only by geography as it takes place on planet Earth. In this war God moves (by divine intervention/ Providence) those governments, political /ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Catholic Church (the City of God) in order to oppose by all means—including military—those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Devil (the City of Devil).\n\nIn other cases, any obvious theme may be lacking. Some universal chronicles bear a more or less encyclopedic character, with many digressions on non-historical subjects, as is the case with the \"Chronicon\" of Helinand of Froidmont.\n\nOther notable universal chroniclers of the Medieval West include Bede (c. 672 or 673–735), the Christherre-Chronik, Helinand of Froidmont (c. 1160—after 1229), Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636), Jans der Enikel, Matthew Paris (c. 1200-1259), Ranulf Higdon (c. 1280-1363), Rudolf von Ems, Sigebert of Gembloux (c. 1030–1112), Otto von Freising (c. 1114–1158), and Vincent of Beauvais (c. 1190-1264?).\n\nThe tradition of universal history can even be seen in the works of medieval historians whose purpose may not have been to chronicle the ancient past, but nonetheless included it in a local history of more recent times. One such example is the \"Decem Libri Historiarum\" of Gregory of Tours (d. 594), where only the first of his ten books describes creation and ancient history, while the last six books focus on events in his own lifetime and region. While this reading of Gregory is currently a widely accepted hypothesis in historical circles, the central purpose of Gregory's writing is still a topic of hot debate.\n\nIn the medieval Islamic world (13th century), universal history in this vein was taken up by Muslim historians such as Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i Juvaini (\"The History of The World Conqueror\") by Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni, Jami al-Tawarikh (\"Compendium of Chronicles\") by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani (now held at the University of Edinburgh) and the \"Muqaddimah\" by Ibn Khaldun.\n\nAn early European project was the \"Universal History\" of George Sale and others, written in the mid-18th century.\n\nChristian writers as late as Bossuet in his \"Discours sur l'histoire universelle\" (Speech of Universal History) are still reflecting on and continuing the Medieval tradition of universal history.\nSpeech of Universal History is considered by many Catholics as an actual second edition or continuation of the City of God. In this work Bossuet continues to provide an update of universal history according to Augustine’s thesis of universal war between those humans that follow God and those who follow the Devil. This concept of world history guided by Divine Providence in a universal war between God and Devil is part of the official doctrine of the Catholic Church as most recently stated in the Second Vatican Council' s Gaudium et Spes document: \"The Church . . . holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the goal of man, as well as of all human history...all of human life, whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness...The Lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, universal histories proliferated.\n\nPhilosophers such as Kant, Herder, Schiller and Hegel, and political philosophers such as Marx and Herbert Spencer, presented general theories of history that shared essential characteristics with the Biblical account: they conceived of history as a coherent whole, governed by certain basic characteristics or immutable principles. Kant who was one of the earliest thinkers to use the term \"Universal History\" described its meaning in \"Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose\":\nAncient history is the study of the past from the beginning of recorded human history to the Early Middle Ages. In India, the period includes the early period of the Middle Kingdoms, and, in China, the time up to the Qin Dynasty is included.\n\nThe Bronze Age forms part of the three-age system. In this system, it follows the Neolithic Age in some areas of the world. In the 24th century BC, the Akkadian Empire was founded. The First Intermediate Period of Egypt (c. 22nd century BC) was followed by the Middle Kingdom of Egypt between the 21st to 17th centuries BC. The Sumerian Renaissance also developed c. 21st century BC. Around the 18th century BC, the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt began. By 1600 BC, Mycenaean Greece developed, the beginning of the Shang Dynasty in China emerged and there was evidence of a fully developed Chinese writing system. Also around 1600 BC, the beginning of Hittite dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean region is seen. From the 16th to 11th centuries BC the New Kingdom of Egypt dominated the Nile Valley. Between 1550 BC and 1292 BC, the Amarna Period developed.\n\nThe Iron Age is the last principal period in the three-age system, preceded by the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region.\nDuring the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the Ramesside Period occurred in Egypt. Around c. 1200 BC, the Trojan War was thought to have taken place. By c. 1180 BC, the disintegration of the Hittite Empire was underway.\n\nIn 1046 BC, the Zhou force, led by King Wu of Zhou, overthrows the last king of the Shang Dynasty. The Zhou Dynasty is established in China shortly thereafter. In 1000 BC, the Mannaeans Kingdom begins in Western Asia. Around the 10th to 7th centuries BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire forms in Mesopotamia. In 800 BC, the rise of Greek city-states begins. In 776 BC, the first recorded Olympic Games are held.\n\nThe post-classical era, also known as the Middle Ages, is a historical period following the Iron Age, fully underway by the 5th century and lasting to the 15th century, and preceding the early Modern Era. The medieval history is the middle period, or the middle age, in a three-period division of history: Classic, Medieval, and Modern. The precise dates of the beginning, culmination, and end of the medieval history are more or less arbitrarily assumed according to the point of view adopted. Any hard and fast line drawn to designate either the beginning or close of the period in question is arbitrary. The widest limits given, viz., the irruption of the Visigoths over the boundaries of the Roman Empire, for the beginning, and the Middle Ages of the 16th century, for the close, may be taken as inclusively sufficient, and embrace, beyond dispute, every movement or phase of history that can be claimed as properly belonging to the medieval history.\n\nIn Europe, the period saw the large-scale European Migration and fall of the Western Roman Empire. In South Asia, the middle kingdoms of India were the classical period of the region. The \"Medieval\" period on the Indian subcontinent lasts for some 1,500 years, and ends in the 13th century. During the late medieval history, several Islamic empires were established in the Indian subcontinent. In East Asia, the Mid-Imperial China age begins with the reunification of China and ends with China was conquered by the Mongol Empire. The Golden Horde invaded North and West Asia and parts of eastern Europe in the 13th century and established and maintained their khanate until the end of the medieval history.\n\nThe Early medieval history saw the continuation of trends set up in ancient history (and, for Europe, late Antiquity). The period is usually considered to open with those migrations of the German Tribes which led to the destruction of the Roman Empire in the West in 375, when the Huns fell upon the Gothic tribes north of the Black Sea and forced the Visigoths over the boundaries of the Roman Empire on the lower Danube. A later date, however, is sometimes assumed, viz., when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus, the last of the Roman Emperors of the West, in 476. Depopulation, deurbanization, and increased barbarian invasion were seen across the Old World. North Africa and the Middle East, once part of the Eastern Roman Empire, became Islamic. Later in European history, the establishment of the feudal system allowed a return to systemic agriculture. There was sustained urbanization in northern and western Europe.\n\nDuring the High medieval history in Europe, Christian-oriented art and architecture flourished and Crusades were mounted to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim control. The influence of the emerging states in Europe was tempered by the ideal of an international Christendom. The codes of chivalry and courtly love set rules for proper European behavior, while the European Scholastic philosophers attempted to reconcile Christian faith and reason.\n\nDuring the Late medieval history in Europe, the centuries of prosperity and growth came to a halt.\nThe close of the medieval history is also variously fixed; some make it coincide with the rise of Humanism and the Renaissance in Italy, in the 14th century; with the Fall of Constantinople, in 1453; with the discovery of America by Columbus in 1492; or, again, with the great religious schism of the 16th century. A series of famines and plagues, such as the medieval Great Famine and the Black Death, reduced the population around half before the calamities in the late medieval history. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. Western Europe experienced serious peasant risings: the Jacquerie, the Peasants' Revolt, and the Hundred Years' War. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the Western Schism. Collectively the events are a crisis of the Late medieval history.\n\nModern history describes the historical period after the Middle history. Modern history can be further broken down into the \"early modern period\" and the \"late modern period\" after the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. \"Contemporary history\" describes the span of historic events that are immediately relevant to the present time. The Great Divergence refers to the period of time in which the process by which the Western Europe and the parts of the New World overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the powerful and wealthy world civilization of the time, eclipsing Qing China, Mughal India, Tokugawa Japan, and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe modern era began approximately in the 16th century. Many major events caused Europe to change around the start of the 16th century, starting with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the fall of Muslim Spain and the discovery of the Americas in 1492, and Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation in 1517. In England the modern period is often dated to the start of the Tudor period with the victory of Henry VII over Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Early modern European history is usually seen to span from around the start of the 15th century, through the Age of Reason and the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries, until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century.\n\nThe modern era includes the early period, called the early modern period, which lasted from c. 1500 to around c. 1800 (most often 1815). Particular facets of early modernity include:\n\nThe early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a result of mechanization in society, the American Revolution, the first French Revolution; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the of the Congress of Vienna and the peace established by Second Treaty of Paris which ended the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nAs a result of the Industrial Revolutions and the earlier political revolutions, the worldviews of Modernism emerged. The industrialization of many nations was initiated with the industrialization of Britain. Particular facets of the late modernity period include:\n\nOther important events in the development of the Late modern period include:\n\nThe contemporary \"Great Divergence\" is a term given to a period starting in late 1970s when inequality grew substantially in the United States and to a lesser extent in other countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom. The term originated with Nobel laureate, Princeton economist and \"New York Times\" columnist Paul Krugman, and is a reference to the \"Great Compression\", an earlier era in the 1930s and 40s when income became dramatically more equal in the United States and elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n"}
