Acrylic glass can be molded into a variety of forms, and corporations will often create custom promotional items shaped like their products. They are manufactured by pouring acrylic casting resin into a mold. Embedments are acrylic trophies that have an item embedded into the resin. Many materials can be placed in an embedment – paper, metal, acetate sheets, etc. This creates the effect of an item floating within the acrylic statue.\n\nThese trophies are commonly made from Lucite, a branded form of acrylic developed by DuPont. One of the earliest uses of Lucite was in windshields for fighter planes during World War II. Following the war, DuPont promoted various consumer applications of Lucite, including its use in lamps, beer taps, hairbrushes, and jewelry. By virtue of its versatility, Lucite opened up a range of possible design options for deal toys and trophies, often resulting in keen competition among investment banks for the most creative and sophisticated pieces.\n\nAcrylic trophies can be manufactured in a variety of shapes, colors and sizes. The most common styles are clear rectangular “Billboards”, star shapes, circles, and pyramids. These are often engraved with corporate logos and personalized with the name of the recipient. They are also used in awards ceremonies for many organizations.\n\nDeal toys are acrylic trophies used in the financial industry in recognition of sales achievements. Deal toys are most commonly used within the financial community, especially among investment banks, as a means of celebrating successful transactions. Since their beginnings in the 1970s, deal toys have become a fixture in the investment banking community, and as multi-national and cross-border transactions have become increasingly common, they have done much to popularize the use of acrylic in gifts and trophies internationally. \n\nRosato, Dominick V. \"Plastic Encyclopedia and Dictionary\".

Fernández de Palencia became acquainted with Paul of Burgos’ son, Alfonso de Cartagena.\n\nFernández de Palencia went to Italy where he entered the service of Cardinal Bessarion, with whom he remained in Florence until 1453. He became acquainted there with Vespasiano da Bisticci, and studied the humanities with George of Trebizond at Rome.\n\nWhen he returned to Spain, Fernández de Palencia stayed for a time at the home of the Archbishop of Seville, Alonso I de Fonseca. Fernández de Palencia succeeded Juan de Mena as royal chronicler and secretary to Henry IV of Castile. In 1468, he became a supporter of Prince Alfonso (who proclaimed himself \"Alfonso XII\") and intervened in the negotiations for the matrimony between Ferdinand and Isabella, which occurred in 1469. On Isabella’s accession to the throne in 1475, Fernández de Palencia lost his post as royal chronicler.\n\nDuring the War of the Castilian Succession, he served as a diplomat for Castile, assisting in the establishment of the Santa Hermandad in 1476 and the organization of naval reinforcements for the defense of Gran Canaria, a Castilian possession, in 1479. According to Fernández de Palencia, he lost favor with the queen in 1480.\n\nHe died in 1492.\n\nHis main work is the \"Gesta Hispaniensia ex annalibus suorum diebus colligentis\", called, for short, his Décadas, because it was divided into decades in the style of Livy's work. This chronicle, written in Latin, covers the time from the end of the reign of John II of Castile to the year 1481, including the reign of Henry IV of Castile; Henry IV’s war with Prince Alfonso; the War of the Castilian Succession; the consolidation of Castile and Aragon under Ferdinand and Isabella; and the signing of the Treaty of Alcáçovas.\n\nThe work is divided into four decades, each one consisting of 10 books except the fourth, which was left incomplete at Fernández de Palencia’s death, and consists of 6 books. The first three decades were translated into Spanish by Paz y Meliá and published under the title of \"Crónica de Enrique IV\" between 1904 y 1908. Most historians remained unaware of the fourth decade, which was published in 1971 by José López del Toro.\n\nThe other important work by Fernández de Palencia is his \"Anales de la Guerra de Granada\", which concerns the Granada War from its beginnings until the taking of Baza in 1489. It was translated into Spanish by Paz y Meliá in 1909.\n\nFernández de Palencia also wrote \"Batalla campal entre los perros y los lobos\" (\"Pitched Battle Between the Dogs and the Wolves\") (1457, which is a Castilian translation of his own Latin poem. It may be an allegory for the government of Henry IV of Castile. A wolf, Harpaleo, is killed by dogs after he is weakened by his neglect of military discipline. Fernández de Palencia also translated into Castilian his Latin work, the allegory \"Tratado de la perfección del triunfo militar\" (1459. A character named “Exercise” (\"el Ejercicio\"), accompanied by the wise Discretion (\"Discreción\"), tries to find the character named Triumph (\"el Triunfo\"). Triumph refers Exercise to a Roman captain named Gloridoneo, who may represent Alfonso V of Aragon. Gloridoneo is victorious in battle and Triumph grants victory to Order, Exercise, and Obedience –virtues which will help a king emerge victorious, advice that may have been directed to Henry IV.\n\nThe work \"Coplas del provincial\" (The Provincial’s Couplets) is attributed to him. \nHe also wrote lexicographical and linguistic works:\n\n\nHis work as a translator was also very important: he translated in Spanish Plutarch's \"Parallel Lives\" (Seville, 1491) and also Flavius Josephus' \"The Wars of the Jews\" (1492).\n\n\n"}

Moravia emerged after the fall of the Avar Khaganate in the early .

A debate about the location of its core territory began in the second half of the . Imre Boba proposed that the center of Moravia was located near the southern Morava River (in present-day Serbia). Most specialists (including Herwig Wolfram and Florin Curta) rejected Boba's theory, but it was further developed by other historians, including Charles Bowlus and Martin Eggers. In addition to the theory of a \"southern Moravia\", new theories were proposed, arguing for the existence of two Moravias, called \"Greater and Lesser Moravia\", or arguing that the center of Moravia was at the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Mureș. Archaeological evidence does not support the alternative theories, because the existence of 9th-century power centers can only be documented along the northern Morava River, in accordance with the traditional view. However, scholars who accept the traditional view of a \"northern Moravia\" have not fully explained some of the contradictions between the written sources and archaeological evidence. For instance, written sources suggest a southward movement of the armies when mentioning the invasion of Moravia from the Duchy of Bavaria.\n\nThe Moravians emerged as an individual Slavic tribe after the fall of the Avar Khaganate in the early . The first reference to them was recorded in the year in the \"Royal Frankish Annals\". More than a century later, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus mentioned their realm as \"Megale Moravia\", or \"Great Moravia\". The name, which is not mentioned in other primary sources, has been interpreted in various way. \"Megale\" may refer either to a territory which was located \"further away\" from Constantinople or to a former polity that had disappeared by the middle of the .\n\nThe first known Moravian ruler, Mojmir I, assisted the rebellious subjects of Louis the German, the King of East Francia, several times. During his reign, priests came from the Bishopric of Passau (a suffragan of the Archbishopric of Salzburg) to proselytize among the Moravians. Louis the German expelled Mojmir from Moravia in 846. In an attempt to diminish the influence of the German clerics, Mojmir's nephew and successor, Rastislav, requested priests from the Byzantine Empire in the early 860s. Emperor Michael III and Patriarch Photius sent two brothers, Saints Cyril and Methodius, to Moravia. The brothers started to translate liturgical texts into Old Church Slavonic in Moravia. Methodius, who survived his brother, was consecrated as archbishop by Pope Hadrian II in Rome in 869. Under the pope's decision, Moravia, the realm of Rastislav's nephew, Svatopluk, and the Pannonian domains of Koceľ fell within Methodius's jurisdiction, which caused conflicts with the archbishops of Salzburg.\n\nLouis the German occupied Moravia and dethroned Rastislav, and the Bavarian prelates imprisoned Methodius in 870. Svatopluk united his realm with Moravia around 871 and expanded the territory under his rule during the next decades. Methodius was set free on Pope John VIII's demand in 873. However, after his death in 885, his disciples were expelled from Moravia. Svatopluk died in 894. His realm disintegrated because internal conflicts emerged after his death. The Magyars who settled in the Carpathian Basin around 895 destroyed Moravia in the first decade of .\n\nThe systematic study of the history of Moravia began in the , influenced by the ideas of Romanticism and Pan-Slavism. Scholarly discussions have also been colored by political debates for centuries. After the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, \"Great Moravia\" was regarded as an archetype of the common state of the Czechs and Slovaks. The Czechoslovak delegates referred to it when arguing for the recognition of the new state. In 1963, official celebrations of the eleventh centenary of the mission of Constantine and Methodius in Czechoslovakia emphasized the continuity between the early medieval state and its modern successor. A reference to \"Great Moravia\" can be found in the preamble to both the 1948 Constitution of the Czechoslovak Republic and the 1992 Constitution of Slovakia.\n\nSeveral aspects of the history of Moravia are subjects of scholarly debate. Most modern scholars question earlier historians' descriptions of a \"Great Moravian empire\" with huge territories permanently integrated within it. Studies published from the 1990s also dispute the argument that Moravia reached the level of an early medieval state (a lasting and stable polity) during its history.\n\nAccording to the traditional view, Moravia's core territory was located along the northern Morava River, a tributary of the Danube in present-day Czech Republic. Juraj Sklenár, an 18th-century Slovak historian, was the first to propose an alternative location; he argued that Moravia had originally been centered around Sirmium (now Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia), from where it expanded to the north to the lands that now form the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Imre Boba was the first historian in the to challenge the traditional view. After studying the primary sources, he concluded that Moravia's core territory lay near the southern Morava River, around Sirmium. He published his theory in a monograph (\"Moravia's History Reconsidered: A Reinterpretation of Medieval Sources\") in 1971. Most Central European historians (including Herwig Wolfram, Josef Poulík and István Bóna) rejected his argument, but other scholars, including Charles Bowlus and Martin Eggers, developed them further in the 1990s. According to Florin Curta, who does not support the alternative theories, Bowlus has written the \"most elegant presentation\" of their argumentation. Scholars who support the traditional boundaries argue that no archaeological evidence substantiates the existence of a 9th-century power center in the lands where the alternative theories suggest Moravia's core region would have been. On the other hand, excavations proved that important centers of power existed at Mikulčice, Pohansko and other settlements north of the Middle Danube in the as it was predicted by the traditional view.\n\nMichael McCornick says that Boba and his followers generated a \"healthy debate\". Curta emphasizes that the location of Moravia \"may be understandably viewed as a matter of nationalist concern\", because of \"a quite recent history of shifting political frontiers\" in Central Europe. He also writes that \"a hostile, rather than critical, attitude towards Boba's ideas became the norm among Slovak historians\" in the early 1990s. Vincent Sedlák, a Slovak historian, argues that Boba developed his theory \"to deny the historical validity of Slovak territory\"; Curta writes that this is not a baseless statement. Most arguments of Boba and his followers have been \"effectively countered\", but the \"interpretation of the written evidence provided by the Frankish sources continues to be debated\", according to Nora Berend, Przemyslaw Urbańczyk and Przemyslaw Wiszewski. Jiří Macháček, also an opponent to the alternative theories, argues that \"the serious problems of geographical orientation raised by analysis of the written sources, which ultimately led Imre Boba and his followers to question the traditional location of Great Moravia, will have to be explained in some other way.\" However, he also says, the alternative theories have been demonstrated to be a non-perspective branch of research and they are not accepted by the international scientific community. According to Roger Collins, the dispute about Moravia's location \"remains to be resolved\"; he also argues that archaeological evidence should not be overemphasized against written sources.\n\nIn 1784, Juraj Sklenár, a Slovak historian and teacher of rhetoric in Pressburg (today's Bratislava), published \"Vetustissumus magnae Moravie situs et primus in eam Hungarorum ingressus et incursus\" (). His work had a political purpose and character. He argued that the Magyars never conquered the territory inhabited by the Slovaks and the latter voluntarily joined the Kingdom of Hungary during the rule of Ladislaus I of Hungary.\n\nSklenár associated (Great) Moravians with the Slavs who settled near the Morava River in Moesia and adopted the name Moravians. Sklenár supported his claim by the work of the Russian chronicler Nestor. Sklenár argued that Old Moravia was located not only in Moesia but also in Pannonia. He supported this argument with the writings of Constantine VII and especially his work \"De administrando imperio\", which placed Great Moravia in the territory between Trajan's Bridge, Sirmium (today's Sremska Mitrovica) and Belgrade. Sklenár also used Frankish sources and cited Methodius's appointment as bishop of Pannonia. Sklenár argued that the original territory of Mojmír I was in the south, on the border of Moesia and Pannonia, and that Pribina's Nitrava (a different city from modern-day Nitra) was also on this border. He suggests that Mojmír expelled Pribina from Nitrava and that Pribina then crossed the Sava river and settled in lower Pannonia. Old Moravia then expanded to include Dacia. He suggested that the location of Great Moravia in the territories of modern-day Moravia and Slovakia was to be explained by further expansion to the west and that the territory between the Morava and Hron rivers (western and central Slovakia) would have been ruled by Czechs and Bohemians and that it should be called Bohemia or Magna Chroatia (Great Croatia). He used a letter from Bavarian bishops – who mentioned Pagan tribes subjugated by Svatopluk and forced to adopt Christianity – to argue that the region was conquered by Svatopluk and that \"Czech Moravia\" was joined to Great Moravia only in 890 (along with Bohemia) after the agreement between Svatopluk and Arnulf of Carinthia. Similar opinions were sustained by Gheorghe Şincai a Romanian historian of the 18th century \n\nSklenár's theory was questioned by István Katona, a prominent Hungarian historian. This led to intensive scientific dispute, not least because Sklenár questioned the reliability of an anonymous chronicle that was one of the key sources for contemporary historiography. The dispute was followed with interest both in Moravia and Bohemia. Sklenár's arguments and the dispute were well known to prominent Slavists like Josef Dobrovský or Pavel Jozef Šafárik, but his theory did not find support among Slovak, Czech, Moravian or Hungarian historians.\n\nAccording to Boba's theory, Moravia was not an independent state north of the Middle Danube, but a principality, located in Pannonia, within a larger state, \"Sclavonia\". Sclavonia, he argued, developed between the Adriatic Sea and the Drava River after the fall of the Avar Khaganate. Most Latin and Slavic names of the Principality of Moravia and its inhabitants show that it was named after a town, called \"Margus\" or \"Marava\". Priscus a late-Roman scholar, mentioned a city named \"Margus\" on the southern Morava river (also called \"Margus\" in antiquity).\n\nBoba says that the realm of Liudewit, a rebellious Slavic prince in Pannonia, obviously included Moravia. The first reference to the Moravians (their homage to Louis the German in Frankfurt) was recorded for the year of Liudewit's expulsion from his seat by the Franks (822). The rulers of the Sclavonian principalities made several attempts to achieve an independent position. Svatopluk closely cooperated with the Holy See to increase his autonomy. He conquered the region of the northern Morava river and expanded his authority over Bohemia in 890.\n\nAccording to Boba, geographical references in the \"Annals of Fulda\" also show that Moravia was located to the south of the Danube. For instance, the annals recorded that Louis the German's army moved \"ultra Danuvium\" (\"across the Danube\" or \"over the Danube\") when he invaded Moravia in 864, suggesting a southward movement across the Danube towards Moravia from the perspective of the Fulda Abbey (which stood in a land to the north of the river). The same source also mentioned that the retainers of Arn, Bishop of Würzburg, ambushed a group of Moravian Slavs on their way back to Moravia from Bohemia, implying that the Moravians moved to the south or southeast (instead of moving towards the northern Morava River) when returning from Bohemia. Florin Curta, who does not accept Boba's analysis, says that the \"Annals of Fulda\", written in a distant monastery, can hardly be regarded as a reliable source of information about the geography of Central Europe.\n\nBoba also says that the comparison of different records of the same historical event concerning Moravia also suggest that Moravia was located in Pannonia. For instance, the Magyars destroyed Pannonia (according to the \"Annals of Fulda\") or Moravia (according to Regino of Prüm) in 894, implying that Pannonia and Moravia were one and the same territory.\n\nEmperor Constantine VII mentioned \"great Moravia\" four times in his \"De administrando imperio\". According to his catalogue of the peoples that were the neighbors of the Hungarians, \"great Moravia, the country of Sphendoplokos\" was located to the south of the Principality of Hungary. When listing the \"landmarks and names along the Danube river\", Constantine stated that \"great Moravia, the over which in former days Sphendoplokus used to rule.\" lay beyond Trajan's Bridge, Sirmium and Belgrade. According to Boba, all descriptions show that Constantine thought that Moravia had been situated in the wider region of Trajan's Bridge (in present-day Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania), Belgrade and Sirmium. The Hungarian historian Sándor László Tóth says that Constantine, who knew that the Hungarians had occupied Moravia, most probably described Moravia based on his information of the Hungarians' land around 950, instead of using earlier sources.\n\nFlorin Curta says that primary sources show that Moravia could not be located in the region of Sirmium. The \"Life of Methodius\" recorded that the \"\"koroljъ ugrъrъsk\" came to the lands of the Danube\" and Methodius went to see him. According to Curta, the episode refers to a meeting between a \"Magyar king\" and Methodius during Methodius's journey to or from the Byzantine Empire in 881 or 882. This would make the southern location of Moravia impossible, because Methodius would not have approached the region of the Lower Danube (dominated by the Magyars in the 880s) if he had travelled between Sirmium and Constantinople. Many scholars (including Marvin Kantor, the translator of the \"Life of Methodius\") say that the \"koroljъ ugrъrъsk\" was actually Emperor Charles the Fat; if their interpretation is valid, Methodius met the emperor in East Francia. According to Curta, the \"Life of St. Clement of Ohrid\", a hagiography attributed to Theophylact of Ohrid who died in 1126, suggests that Methodius's three disciples, Clement, Naum and Angelarius, approached the Danube from the north before crossing the river at Belgrade during their flight from Moravia to the Byzantine Empire after Methodius's death.\n\nPope John VIII's letters identify Methodius's ecclesiastic province as \"diocesis Pannonica\". The \"Life of Methodius\" also state that Methodius was \"consecrated to the bishopric of Pannonia, to the seat of Saint Andronicus, an Apostle of the seventy\". If Methodius was ordained bishop in accordance with the canons adopted at previous synods, he must have been consecrated to a cathedral in a town and could not be moved from his episcopal see, according to Boba. For instance, the Council of Chalcedon decreed in 451 that \"No one ... who belongs to the ecclesiastical order, is to be ordained without title, unless the one ordained is specially assigned to a city or village church or to a martyr's shrine or a monastery\".\n\nMaddalena Betti says that Boba's argumentation, which is based on canons from the 4th and , is \"problematic\". Methodius's career followed the pattern set up for earlier medieval missionaries, including Willibrord-Clement and Wynfrith-Boniface. Wynfrith-Boniface started his missions as a simple priest; he was then ordained a missionary bishop for the \"people of Germany and to those east of the river Rhine\", but his see was not specified; finally, he received a \"pallium\" in token of his right to organize a new ecclesiastical province. She argues that, in a similar fashion, Methodius returned from Rome to the domains of Koceľ as a simple monk, that he was subsequently consecrated as a missionary bishop and that, finally, he received a \"pallium\".\n\nAccording to Boba, Latin and Old Church Slavonic records of Methodius's title show that he was ordained archbishop of the see in a town called Maraba or Morava. Boba associated Maraba or Morava with Sirmium, because Sirmium was the capital of the Roman province of Pannonia Secunda. To prove that Methodius had a fixed see, Boba suggested that a medieval church, excavated in Mačvanska Mitrovica in 1966, was identical with Methodius's cathedral. V. Popović, an archaeologist, soon refuted the identification, demonstrating that the church was built in the .\n\nThe \"Forgeries of Lorch\" (a collection of papal documents forged for Piligrim, who was Bishop of Passau between 971 and 991) also contain references to Moravia. The documents show that late-10th-century clerics in Passau thought that Moravia had been located in Upper Pannonia and Moesia a century earlier. According to Alexandru Madgearu, a Romanian historian, Piligrim's forgeries prove that, by the time they were completed, the location of the former Roman province of Moesia had been forgotten and the clerics who completed the forgeries applied its name to Moravia.\n\nAccording to Maddalena Betti, Alfred the Great's translation of Orosius's \"History of the World\", which was completed in the late , prove that Moravia was located to the north of the Danube. Alfred the Great listed the \"Thyringas\", \"Behemas\", the \"half of the Begware\" and the \"land of the Vistula\" among the neighbors of the \"Maroara\". Betti also notes that Constantine and Methodius crossed the Pannonian domains of Koceľ while travelling from Moravia to Venice, according to the \"Life of Constantine\", which also shows that Moravia most plausibly lay north of Koceľ's domains.\n\nThe \"Supetar Cartulary\", which was compiled in the , contains a list of the predecessors of Zvonimir, King of Croatia, which begins with \"Sventopolk\". The late 12th-century \"Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja\" wrote of Sventopelk, the son of a certain Svetimir, who was descended from one Ratimir. According to the same source, \"Constantine the Philosopher\" crossed Sventopelk's realm when travelling from Bulgaria to Rome. The source also recorded that Sventopelk was crowned king \"on the field of Dalma\". The \"Chronica Ragusina Junii Restii\" (a chronicle written in the Republic of Ragusa) stated that Svetopelek's father, Svetimir had been the King of Bosnia. Two later annals from Ragusa (now Dubrovnik in Croatia) referred to a king from a Moravian-Croatian dynasty. Boba and Bowlus associated Ratimir with Ratimir, Duke of Lower Pannonia and Sventopelk with Svatopluk I of Moravia. According to Boba and Bowlus, these sources clearly associate Moravia with Dalmatia and Bosnia. Markus Osterrieder describes Boba as \"shockingly uncritical\" in accepting the \"Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja\" as a reliable source. Betti argues that the later sources did not describe the political situation of the 9th-century Balkan Peninsula, because they were written to \"support the political needs of subsequent centuries\".\n\nPéter Püspöki-Nagy proposed the existence of two Moravias: a \"Great\" Moravia at the southern Morava river in present-day Serbia, and another Moravia on the northern Morava river in present-day Czech Republic. Toru Senga, a Japanese historian living in Hungary, likewise concludes that two polities named Moravia co-existed in the 9th century and were united under Svatopluk I. Before unification, the first (Rastislav's) Moravia was located in present-day Czech Republic. The second (Svatopluk's) Moravia was in present-day Hungary between Danube and Tisa and neighboured with Bulgars not only in the east but also in the north (present-day Slovakia). Again, none of these theories achieved wider acceptance in the academic community, particularly among European historians. Critical reactions came also from the Hungarian scholars (György Györffy, Csanád Bálint).\n\nIn 1995, German historian Martin Eggers published his dissertation \"\"Das Großmährische Reich\" Realität oder Fiktion?\" (\"Great Moraviam Empire\" - reality or fiction?). According to Eggers, the Avars played an important role in the territories north of the Danube also after the fall of the Avar Khaganate. Similarly to Toru's and Püspöki Nagy's view, Eggers also backs up the hypothesis of two Moravias, however he places both entities in the Southeast.\n\nEggers says that the Moravian tribe (Moravljane) came to the east of the Carpathian Basin after the fall of the khaganate. Present-day Slovakia should be inhabited by \"remnant Avar groups\" (Vulgarii - Bulgars) up to territories settled by the Vistulans in present-day Poland and the archaeological findings in Moravia were attributed by him to some \"ethnic group with the Avar tradition\". Egger's Moravians helped to defend the Frankish Empire against attacks from the east and they later founded their own domain around center near the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Mureș at present-day Cenad in Romania. These Moravians were closely connected to other southern Slavs and shared a common material culture (Bijelo Brdo culture). They were connected also personally, because Mojmir, Rastislav and Svatopluk had origin in the same Bosnian-Slavonian dynasty. Also in this theory, the author questioned the location of the Pribina's Nitrava which might not be the same place as Slovak Nitra. While Rastislav ruled this southern Moravia, Svatopluk was a Bosnian-Slavonian ruler. In 871, Svatopluk came to power in Cenad and both principalities were unified under his leadership. This become a basis for a large but short-lived empire which lasted only for one generation. Svatopuk expanded his influence to Croatia (879), took control over present-day Slovakia (874–880), joined Panonia (884) and received his crown during a formal ceremony (885). In 890, Arnulf donated him Bohemia, which had already close ties to (Czech) Moravia. Only after the fall of the Great Moravia, the name was transferred to the north and a false awareness about its history began to spread.\n\nEggers' work was published by prestigious publisher and thus raised also larger critical reactions of central European historians and archaeologists. Herwig Wolfram, Director of the Austrian Institute for Historical Research, who had an early access to his dissertation work not available yet to other experts, immediately pointed to some problems related to Egger's interpretation of written sources. According to his opinion, historians should rely mainly on such sources which are close to events in time and space (which was not fulfilled in Eggers's work) and he confirmed traditional localization. Several critics noticed that Eggers references to unpublished part of his work or studies which only have to be published in the future. Like Boba and others, Eggers again depends to a large extent on Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, a source known for numerous fictions and inaccuracies. Bijelo Brdo culture is dated to more than one hundred years later than it was assumed by him. A theory about remnant Avar groups in Slovakia in the second half of the 9th century is not based on any archeological research and earlier Avar settlements are documented only in the southernmost part of Slovakia. Marsina criticizes Eggers' approach as unreliable and unscientific, stating that his theory contradicted not only the state of research in the 1990s, but research of the Avar settlements in Slovakia since the 1950s. In this regard, Třeštík notices also incompatibility with written sources, the trial to locate Vulgarii who \"had only 5 castles\" (see Bavarian Geographer), they were numerous people and had not a custom to build castles clearly describes (according to him) situation in the Bulgar Khaganate and not present-day Slovakia. In the case of Bohemia, Eggers conceals mention about an occupation of Bohemia by Svatopluk by force which could pose several problems for his theory, according to Třeštík. Eggers' view on early relationship between Bohemia and Moravia is unusual, especially for a German historian. Bohemia should control Moravia, but none comparable power centers have been found in Bohemia at the time. The archaeological research suggests that the earliest Bohemian hillforts were inspired by Moravian and not the other way around.\n\nOn the other hand, Eggers's work received some support from Horace Lunt who was not a historian, but a linguist and philologist. He writes that \"Close and open minded study of the remarkably limited primary sources inevitably reveals that crucial structural elements of the intricate traditional construct are pure guesswork. What held it all together was the dogmatic authority of generations of scholars; to accept the dogma is to demonstrate \"right\" thinking\". Likewise, John B. Freed says that he is inclined to accept Egger's (and Bowlus's) \"arguments for a southern Moravia because such a location provides a better explanation for the East Frankish military structure and the Cyrillo-Methodian mission\". However, he also admits that he is not a specialist of the history of the late Carolingian period.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5453295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5453295", "title": "Altstadt", "text": "Altstadt\n\nAltstadt is the German language word for \"old town\", and generally refers to the historical town or city centre within the old town or city wall, in contrast to younger suburbs outside. \"Neustadt\" (new town), the logical opposite of \"Altstadt\", mostly stands for a part of the \"Altstadt\" in modern sense, sometimes only a few years younger than the oldest part, sometimes a late medieval enlargement.\n\nMost German towns have an \"Altstadt\", even though the ravages of war have destroyed many of them, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). In the \"War of the Palatinian Succession\" of 1688, the order to \"Brûlez le Palatinat!\" was executed by Mélac, devastating many cities and large parts of South Western Germany, like the Heidelberg Castle.\n\nAllied Strategic bombing during World War II destroyed nearly all large cities, with Dresden being the most prominent victim.

Its contents are consequently regarded as being of little value to Egyptology, although a classic of pseudepigraphy.\n\nWhile the unknown author is considered to have displayed a thorough knowledge of Manethon, the best indication of forgery is the introductory dedication to Ptolemy II Philadelphus, referring to him as \"σεβαστῷ\" (\"sebastōi\") — i.e. \"august\" or \"Augustus\", a Roman title that was not used until centuries after Manethon's death.\n\nSyncellus states that Manethon included information from monuments in \"the Siriadic land\" (variously conjectured to be Assyria, Arabia or Egypt), that had been engraved before the Deluge, but afterward had been translated and stored in hieroglyphic books in Egyptian temples.\n"}

She was married to Prince Achille Murat, an exiled Napoleonic prince living in America, from 1826 to 1847. She was born near Fredericksburg, Virginia and died in Tallahassee, Florida, United States.\n\nMurat was the great-grandniece of George Washington. She was a daughter of Colonel Byrd C. Willis (August 29, 1781 – 1846) and his wife Mary Lewis. Mary Lewis was the granddaughter of Fielding Lewis, George Washington's brother-in-law. Through the Lewis family, she was also a relative of explorer Meriwether Lewis.\n\nHer parents made their first home in Orange near the Court House. Later they came to Willis Hill. Col. Willis paid little attention to the management of the plantation and instead spent his time fox hunting, racing, and attending parties. Income was derived from the race profits and the sale of fire wood.\n\nCatherine married Atchison Gray, son of John Gray of Traveller's Rest (Kearneysville, West Virginia). Atchison died less than 12 months after their marriage and their child, born after his death, died also.\n\nAbout 1825, Catherine Murat came to Tallahassee with her parents, three brothers and two sisters. In 1826 she met and married her second husband, Prince Achille Murat. He was a son of Joachim Murat, former King of Naples and Caroline Bonaparte.\n\nHis maternal uncles included Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon I of France, Lucien Bonaparte, Louis Bonaparte and Jérôme Bonaparte. His maternal aunts included Elisa Bonaparte and Pauline Bonaparte.\n\nCatherine (Willis Gray) Murat, was entertained when abroad. On 8 September 1831, Catherine was present at the coronation of William IV of the United Kingdom and was given a seat in Westminster Abbey. \n\nIn 1847, she inherited the Lipona Plantation in Jefferson County, Florida upon the death of her husband. In 1854 she bought Bellevue, in Leon County, which became her primary residence. \n\nCatherine became involved in the nation’s first successful preservation effort, the work to preserve George Washington’s home. In 1858, Murat was appointed the first Vice Regent for Florida for the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, the title given the central person in each state organizing the association’s work. Working closely with Ellen Call Long, she led the efforts as the state raised $3,791 toward the restoration of Mount Vernon, the largest per capita amount raised by any of the 30 contributing states. Murat served in that post until her death. Despite her staunch Unionism, she was named master of ceremonies during the celebrations of the Florida Secession Convention in 1861. Later, during the American Civil War, Murat participated in the local \"Soldiers Aid Societies,\" who met as sewing circles to clothe the southern troops.\nEarly in 1866, Napoleon III of France, a maternal first cousin of her husband, granted Murat an annuity from the French government in consideration of her losses during the Civil War. Catherine Murat died August 6, 1867 at Bellevue.\nCatherine's marker in the old Tallahassee Episcopal Cemetery reads: \"SACRED to the Memory of PRINCESS C. A. MURAT, Widow of COL. CHARLES LOUIS NAPOLEON ACHILLES MURAT, and Daughter of the late COL. BIRD C. WILLIS, of Virginia. Who departed this life on 6 August 1867, in the 64th year of her age. A kind and affectionate wife and sister, a sincere and devoted friend. None knew her but to love her. None named her but to praise.

Similar coins of the same family may have been struck later, although there is no firm evidence of this. \nThey circulated in parallel and openly with the Roman denarii of the same weight. Furthermore, some isolated exemplar come from stratigraphic contexts much more recent than the insurrection against Rome.\n\nOne coin that circulated during the Social Wars was a silver denarius coin that on the front side depicted Bacchus with a wreath and on the back depicted the Italian bull goring the Roman wolf. There is an inscription in Oscan on both sides.\n\nAnother example of a silver denarius personifies Italia on one side, and on the other shows eight warriors swearing an oath.\n\nThere is also in the Paris Collection a well-preserved single gold stater of Attic weight of 8.47 gr. (a picture of this coin can be seen here. A drawing is in ) and its first appearance dates back to 1827, although Julius Friedländer reported 1830: \n\nThe authenticity of this coin is disputed. The genuineness of the piece was supported by Julius Friedländer in his fundamental work about Oscan coinage with an argument based on the perfect accuracy of the legend when compared with the poor knowledge of the Oscan alphabet and language at the time the coin first appeared before the pioneering works of Klenze (1839), Mommsen (1845) and Lepsius (1841). The coin, in particular, shows a perfect distinction between \"i\" and stressed \"í\" (the difference, in Oscan script, is the addiction of a little line), a distinction that none were aware of before the work of Klenze.\n\nArguments against the coin's authenticity come from Secondina Lorenza Cesano and Alberto Campana, who very closely follows Cesano reasoning.\n\nSome of the iconographic themes were original, while others were borrowed from the Roman coinage.\n\nWhen borrowed, the themes acquired new meanings or resonances. For example, the heads on the obverse was usually a personification of Italia depicted as a goddess with a helmet, which replaced the head of Rome, accompanied by a legend reproducing his name, , in the Latin alphabet or (víteliú = Italia) in Oscan alphabet (there is a unique copy, actually in the \"de Blacas\" collection, known to report the double \"\" [vítelliú]).\n\nThe inscriptions were partly in Oscan and partly in Latin characters. The pieces were struck by a central mint with two different and simultaneous issues, one for the Oscan-speaking and one for the Latin-speaking citizens.\n\nLegends often record the names of the chief leaders of the Revolt: Quintus Poppaedius Silo, Gaius Papius Mutilus, with his title \"Imperator\", an unknown Numerius Lucius (?), and others.\n\n\n\n"}

Active during the years c.1640 to 1671, he was one of the last traditionally trained Irish Gaelic scholars, and was a member of the Clan MacFhirbhisigh, a leading family of northern Connacht. His best-known work is the \"Leabhar na nGenealach\", which was published in 2004 as \"The Great Book of Irish Genealogies\", more than 300 years after it had been written.\n\nMacFhirbhisigh was most likely born at the family castle, in the parish of Lackan, Tireragh, County Sligo, sometime in the first quarter of the 17th century. He was originally known as \"Dubhaltach Og\" (\"young Dubhaltach\") to distinguish him from his grandfather, \"Dubhaltach Mór\" (\"big Dubhaltach\"). He was the eldest of four sons born to Giolla Iosa Mor Mac Fhirbhisigh and an unnamed daughter of Eoghan Gruamadha Mac Diarmada of the Sliocht Cormaic Oig Mac Diarmada of Tireragh. It is unknown whether he himself was married or had children. On page nine of his Introduction to \"The Great Book of Irish Genealogies\", Nollaig Ó Muraíle writes:\n\nIt's possible that he had received some sort of formal education in Galway, studying English, Latin and some Greek. This is implied from his use of all three languages in his works. There is also the possibility that he received additional training at the Mac Aodhagáin bardic school located at Ballymacegan, Lough Derg, County Tipperary, which was run by noted scholar, Flann Mac Aodhagáin.\n\nMac Fhirbhisigh's friends and acquaintances included Flann Mac Aodhagain, John Lynch, Patrick D'Arcy, Mary Bonaventure Browne, Dathi Og O Dubhda, Sir James Ware, Sir Diarmuid Ó Seachnasaigh, Eoin Ó Gnímh and Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh. His contemporaries include Peregrine O'Duignan, Mícheál Ó Cléirigh, Richard Martyn, Daibhidh Ó Duibhgheannáin, Fr. Pádraig Ó Fiannachta, and Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim.\n\nMac Fhirbhisigh's career as a scholar overlapped with a devastating period of war, famine, and plague in Ireland (the Irish Confederate Wars of 1641–1653) but, curiously, he never mentions contemporary politics or events in his works.\n\nThe first certain date that can be associated with Dubhaltach is 5 May 1643, when he was situated at Ballymacegan translating the ancient glossary \"Duil Laithne\" (\"the book of Latin\"). In that year he transcribed from an old Mac Aodhagan manuscript what is now known as the \"Fragmentary Annals of Ireland\". According to a Latin note prefixed to the manuscript, it was made for \"Rev. Dr. John Lynch\", then Archdeacon of Tuam. It may also have been in 1643 that he transcribed \"Beatha Neimheadh Deidheanach\" (a legal tract) and the \"Chronicon Scotorum\". Both of these may have been further copies made by Mac Fhirbhisigh at the behest of John Lynch.\n\nAt some point between 1643 and early 1645, Dubhaltach moved to the town of Galway, where in April 1645 he completed a transcription of the seventy-page historical-genealogical compilation called \"Seanchas Síl Ír\". His source can be shown to be the late 14th-century manuscript called \"The Book of Uí Mhaine\" (also known as the \"Book of Ó Dubhagáin\"). Dubhaltach's very faithful transcript is especially valuable as four of the original fourteen folios have since been lost.\n\nOn 8 December 1647 Dubhaltach noted that he had completed the translation – from English into Irish – of part of one book and all of a second concerning the Rule of St. Clare, and related matters. This translation was commissioned by Mother Mary Bonaventure Browne, Abbess of the Order of the Poor Clares in Galway. The initial section had been copied by Brother Mícheál Ó Cléirigh in 1636, and it was left to Mac Fhirbhisigh to complete it. He states in a note that his place of writing was the \"College of Galway\", most probably the college-house of the Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas, Galway. The college house was demolished in 1836, though the church itself is still in regular use. The Poor Clares are now based on Nun's Island in Galway city centre.\n\nIn April 1649 Mac Fhirbhisigh was working on what would come to be considered his \"magnum opus\", \"Leabhar na nGenealach\", or the \"Book of Genealogies\". Nollaig Ó Muraíle describes it as \"a compilation of Irish genealogical lore relating to the principal Gaelic and Anglo-Norman families of Ireland and covering the period from pre-Christian times to the mid-17th century and collected from a variety of sources.\" The fact that many of these sources no longer exist adds considerably to the value of Mac Fhirbhisigh's work. This is particularly true of items held at Lackan by the Mac Fhirbhisigh's.\n\nIt is not known how long Dubhaltach spent collecting the necessary materials and planning the book's layout. Nor is it known when he commenced writing; he does note that on the \"13 April, in Galway, 1649,\" he had completed a fifty-page tract on the genealogies of the Ui Bhruin down to \"\"do shlioch Brian mc Eathach Muighmheadhoin\"/the lineage of Brian son of Eochaidh Muighmheadhoin.\" That August saw him complete a catalogue of the Kings of Ireland, from Partholón to Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, entitled \"Réim Ríoghraidhe Éireann\". He names the source of this material as \"Leabhar Airisean Fhearghail Uí Ghadhra\", an alternative name for the \"Annals of the Four Masters\". Exactly how this work reached Galway has never been explained.\n\n\"Réim Ríoghraidhe Éireann\" was completed on 8 August 1649, just as the bubonic plague entered Galway on a Spanish ship. Over the next nine months it killed some 3,700 of the town's inhabitants. Of Dubhaltach's whereabouts and activities in this period, Ó Muraíle has the following to say:\n\nIn fact Dubhaltach's only remark thought to be connected with this time is what Ó Muraíle calles a \"breathtaking understatement\" that Dubhaltach writes in the \"Díonbhrollach\" (preface):\n\nWith most of the text compiled, Dubhaltach added an index of just under three thousand entries, an index being rare in a Gaelic manuscript. This was completed on the Feast of the Holy Innocents (28 December 1650) just as English parliamentary forces, completing the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, crossed the Shannon. In July, these forces, under Sir Charles Coote, began a nine-month siege of Galway which ended in the town's surrender in April 1652. As in earlier periods of his life, Dubhaltach's activities in this period are unknown.\n\nIn July 1653 at an unknown location, perhaps still in County Galway, he added further material, along with a separate index to the book's list of Saint's pedigrees. Ó Muraíle identifies one of his probable sources for this material as \"one of two early-12th-century manuscript-recensions of the work known as the \"Irish Liber Hynorum\", while another was the great early-15th-century manuscript now known as the \"Leabhar Breac\" (formerly \"Leabhar More Duna Daighre\").\" As the latter seems to have been held during the length of the 17th century at the Franciscan convent of Ceineal Fheichin, Abby, County Galway, it may hold a clue to Mac Fhirbhisigh's location at some point after the fall of Galway.\n\nIn April 1656, Dubhaltach acted as a witness to his hereditary lord, Dathi Og O Dubhda (David O Dowd) upon his marriage to Dorothy O Down. He may have drafted the \"Articles of Agreement\" or marriage articles, in English. Two other Mac Fhirbihisgh's, his brother Seamus and cousin Myles, are also listed as witnesses. In the same year he compiled a work on legendary Irish authors. It is now lost apart from a partial copy begun in May 1657. The final part of it, comprising about a third of the total, was only completed in the spring of 1666.\n\nIn October 1657 – on a Sunday – Dubhaltach was writing in Sligo town, beside the ruined Dominican Abbey. His presence there was in direct contravention of a Cromwellian edict that forbade Catholics to approach or enter towns such as Sligo. Added to that, his working on a Sunday would have further aroused Puritan ire. His labour was adding further material to \"Leabhar na nGenealach\" from manuscripts no longer extant. The tracts included \"Séanadh Saighre\" and \"Do Fhorshloinntibh Éireann\". After this he disappears until around 1662 when he is named in an official report as liable to pay hearth-tax for a dwelling in Castletown, just a few miles north of his native Lackan. Also around this time, he is mentioned in print for the only time in his life, in \"Cambrensis Eversus\", by John Lynch.\n\nDuring 1665 and 1666, Dubhaltach was employed in Dublin by Sir James Ware, providing him with English translations of parts of certain Irish tracts. These included extracts from the \"Annals of Inisfallen\" and the \"Annals of Tigernach\" for the years 1174–1281 and 1172–1178, respectively. From the archives of the Clan MacFhirbhisigh he drew upon documents and sources to write a tract, in English, on early and medieval Irish bishops. Few of his sources are now in existence. Much of this was used for Ware's final work, \"De Praesulibus Hiberniae\", a history of Irish bishops published in 1665.\n\nThe following spring Mac Fhirbhisigh had returned home to Tireragh. On St. Patrick's Day he began compiling a catalogue, in Irish, of early bishops and extinct Irish bishoprics. On Monday 2 April 1666 he began work on the \"Cuimre na nGenealach\", an ambitious, revised abridgement (or in Irish, \"cumire\") of \"Leabhar na nGenealach\". He continued work on the project into the summer but it is not known if he ever completed it as the original was lost and two surviving copies appear incomplete.\n\nMac Fhirbhisigh had returned to work for Ware in Dublin by early November. On 6 November 1666 he commenced a translation, into English, of part of the \"Annals of Lackan\". This work too is lost, and his translation of the years 1443–68 is almost all that survives of a work compiled by members of his own family since before 1397. With the death of Sir James on 1 December, Dubhaltach's employment and time in Dublin came to an end.\n\nAfter the death of Sir James, Mac Fhirbhisigh may have travelled to Gort, seeking patronage from Diarmuid Ó Seachnasaigh (Sir Dermot O Shaughnessey), as indicated by a poem he apparently composed in 1667. It is thought that also in this year or shortly after he obtained a copy of the important early Irish law tract, Senchas Már. It seems he also travelled to Larne in County Antrim, seeking patronage from Randall MacDonnell, Marquess of Antrim. Here it seems he left or sold about twelve or more manuscripts to a local bard, Eoin Ó Gnímh.\n\nNothing more is known of Mac Fhirbhisigh until January 1671, when his friend, Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh, noted in a manuscript: \"1670/1 mense Janu: Dualdus Firbisius obiit, a Thoma Croftono occisus.\" Mac Fhirbhisigh was stabbed to death by local man Thomas Crofton, at a shebeen near the village of Skreen, County Sligo. The circumstances of Mac Fhirbhisigh's death were related by Eugene O'Curry as follows:\nHe appears to have been buried at his local church, Kilglass (\"Cill Molaise\").\n\nAccording to Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh – as noted by Edward Lhuyd – Dubhaltach's manuscripts passed on his death to his lord, David O Dowd. Ó Flaithbheartaigh himself obtained Dubhaltach's transcript of \"Chronicum Scotorum\". William O Sullivan believed that his law manuscripts were passed on to John Conry via the library of Tadhg O'Roddy.\n\nIn 1702 Dubhaltach's genealogical works were in the possession of merchant and part-time scribe, Henry MacCarrick of Sligo. \"Leabhar na nGenealach\" was in this possession till 1705, while the \"Cuimre\" disappears after 1706, fate unknown (there exists a possibility that it was in the possession of Richard Tipper of Dublin, scribe, in the years 1710–30, as he made a copy of it).\n\n\"Leabhar na nGenealach\" next came into the hands of Seamus Bacach Mag Uidhir of \"An Leargaidh\" (Dowra-Blacklion area) who made a copy in 1715 – July 1716 at Stranamart, north-west County Cavan. It is of poor value overall. A transcript of \"Réim Ríoghraidhe Éireann\" was made by him at Doobally in 1713. It next appeared in Dublin, held by John Conry, who penned extracts from it on 24 July 1723. He may have obtained it from the library of Tadhg O Rodaighe (Thady Roddy of Crossfield, County Leitrim). It was sold in 1731 to Dr. John Fergus (\"Eoin O Fearghusa\") of Jervis Street, Dublin, though originally from County Mayo. Dr. Fergus also acquired the anonymous copy of the Cuimre. Following his death and that of his son, Dr. Fergus's daughter put his extensive library up for auction at their home in Abbey Street, Dublin, on 3 February 1766. \"Leabhar na nGenealach\" was purchased by Robert Jocelyn ( who became 1st Earl of Roden in 1771) for £7.1.0. For much of the next hundred and fifty years it was placed at the Jocelyn family home of Tollymore House, Newcastle, County Down, who were in part descended through a female line from the local Magennis clan.\n\nDuring this time extensive use of \"Leabhar na nGenealach\" was made by Charles O'Conor (1770s), Thady Connellan (1830s), John O'Donovan (MacCarrick's version) and Eugene O'Curry, who transcribed in between March 1836 and February 1837. Upon the death of the 6th Earl of Roden in 1911, it was included in a list of items sold to cover his death duties. The auction was held at Sotheby's of London on 10 November 1911, and the manuscript was purchased by Dublin physician Michael F. Cox, for £79.00. Dr. Cox died on 20 February 1926 and his son, Dublin solicitor Arthur Cox, oversaw his father's bequest of the manuscript to University College Dublin on 23 March 1926, \"to be perpetually preserved in its library.\" During the 20th century it was consulted by several scholars such as Eoin MacNeill, Eleanor Knott, Michael V. Duignan, Toirdehealbhach O Raithbhearthaigh, Margaret Emmeline Dobbs and most especially by Father Paul Walsh. In 1971 study of it commenced by Mayoman Nollaig Ó Muraíle, a process that ended with its publication in five volumes by De Burca books in 2004.\n\nThere are no substantial surviving details of Dubhaltach's personal life. It is unknown whether he married or ever had children. His brothers were Padraig (fl. 1663), Diarmaid, and Seamus (fl. 1656) but no sisters are mentioned. Nor does he record the year his father died, or even his mother's name. During the 1690s, one \"Dudley Forbissy, Ardneere, clerk, commonly called Prior of the Abbey of Ardnaree\" appears on a list of persons \"Outlawed for Foreign Treason\". However, the precise identity of this Father Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh of the Order of St. Augustine is not known.\n\nIn 1842, a letter (dated 15 August 1842, Dublin) was received by the Royal Irish Academy from one John Mac Firbis, a farmer, \"in a humble state of poverty,\" from the parish of Lackan, County Sligo. He stated that he was \"fifth in descent from the younger and only brother [sic] of Duald Mac Firbis,\" that, \"the sisters of the said Duald ... retired into Spain, where they ended their lives in a convent.\" Having been informed that works by Dubhaltach and his family were in the possession of the R.I.A., Mac Firbis stated that he \"humbly hopes, from the honor and humanity of the Noblemen and Gentlemen composing the Royal Irish Academy, that he will be allowed some consideration for those works of his ancestors.\" Mac Firbis is listed as John Forbes in the 1834 Tithe Allotments but there is no trace of him or his family in the 1856 Griffith's Valuation. O Muralie suggests that as the letter was written in Dublin, Mac Firbis and his family may have been seeking financial aid while emigrating from Ireland.\n\nUnder the Anglicised surname Forbes, descendants of the Clan MacFhirbhisigh are still to be found in small numbers in north Mayo, mainly in and about the town of Ballina.\n\nMacFhirbhisigh's endeavours ensured the survival of several invaluably important sources of medieval and early Irish history. These include three annals, an early Irish law tract, material on ecclesiastical matters, and translations. His supreme achievement however remains \"Leabhar na nGenealach\", which together with the \"Cuimre\", is comparable in size and scope to the \"Annals of the Four Masters\". Yet it is especially astonishing as it was written by just one man, without any known patron, while the \"Four Masters\" was written by a team funded by Feargal O'Gara.\n\nYet even beyond this, his importance as a collector and transmitter as been noted by the likes of William O Sullivan and Tomas O Concheannain. Nollaig Ó Muraíle sums up his career as follows:\n\nThe following list appears in Appendix B, pages 370–71 of \"The Learned Antiquary.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kleinberg’s wide-ranging scholarly work spans across the fields of history, philosophy, comparative literature and religion. \nHe is the author of \"Haunting History: for a deconstructive approach to the past\" and \"Generation Existential: Martin Heidegger’s Philosophy in France, 1927-61\", which was awarded the 2006 Morris D. Forkosch prize for the best book in intellectual history, by the \"Journal of the History of Ideas\" and co-editor of the volume \"Presence: Philosophy, History, and Cultural Theory for the Twenty-First Century.\" He is completing a book length project titled \"The Myth of Emmanuel Levinas\", on the Talmudic Lectures the French-Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas presented in Paris between 1960 and 1990.\n\nHis research interests include European intellectual history with special interest in France and Germany, critical theory, educational structures, and the philosophy of history.\n\nHe received his B.A from UC. Berkeley and his Ph.D. from UCLA. For high school he attended Windward School in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1998 he was a Fulbright scholar in France. In 2003 he was the recipient of Wesleyan University’s Carol A. Baker ’81 Memorial Prize for excellence in teaching and research. In 2006 his book \"Generation Existential: Heidegger’s Philosophy in France, 1927-1961\" was awarded the Morris D. Forkosch prize for the best book in intellectual history by the Journal of the History of Ideas. In 2011 he was Directeur d’études invité at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, Paris.\n\n\"Haunting History: for a deconstructive approach to the past\"\n\nThis book argues for a deconstructive approach to the practice and writing of history at a moment when available forms for writing and publishing history are undergoing radical transformation. To do so, it explores the legacy and impact of [(deconstruction)] on American historical work; the current fetishization of lived experience, materialism, and the \"real;\" new trends in philosophy of history; and the persistence of ontological realism as the dominant mode of thought for conventional historians.\n\nArguing that this ontological realist mode of thinking is reinforced by current analog publishing practices, Ethan Kleinberg advocates for a hauntological approach to history that follows the work of Jacques Derrida and embraces a past that is at once present and absent, available and restricted, rather than a fixed and static snapshot of a moment in time. This polysemic understanding of the past as multiple and conflicting, he maintains, is what makes the deconstructive approach to the past particularly well suited to new digital forms of historical writing and presentation.\n\n\"Generation Existential:Heidegger<nowiki></nowiki>’s Philosophy in France, 1927-1961\"\n\nWhen we think of Heidegger's influence in France, we tend to focus on such contemporary thinkers as Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Jean-François Lyotard. In Generation Existential, Ethan Kleinberg shifts the focus to the initial reception of Heidegger's philosophy in France by those who first encountered it. Kleinberg explains the appeal of Heidegger's philosophy to French thinkers, as well as the ways they incorporated and expanded on it in their own work through the interwar, Second World War, and early postwar periods. In so doing, Kleinberg offers new insights into intellectual figures whose influence on modern French philosophy has been enormous, including some whose thought remains under-explored outside France.\nAmong Kleinberg's \"generation existential\" are Jean Beaufret, the only member of the group whom one could characterize as \"a Heideggerian\"; Maurice Blanchot; Alexandre Kojéve; Emmanuel Levinas; and Jean-Paul Sartre. In showing how each of these figures engaged with Heidegger, Kleinberg helps us to understand how the philosophy of this right-wing thinker had such a profound influence on intellectuals of the left. Furthermore, Kleinberg maintains that our view of Heidegger's influence on contemporary thought is contingent on our comprehension of the ways in which his philosophy was initially understood, translated, and incorporated into the French philosophical canon by this earlier generation.\n\n\"Presence: Philosophy, History and Cultural Theory for the 21st Century\", a volume co-edited with Ranjan Ghosh\n\nThe philosophy of “presence” seeks to challenge current understandings of meaning and understanding. One can trace its origins back to Vico, Dilthey, and Heidegger, though its more immediate exponents include Jean-Luc Nancy, Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, and such contemporary philosophers of history as Frank Ankersmit and Eelco Runia. The theoretical paradigm of presence conveys how the past is literally with us in the present in significant and material ways: Things we cannot touch nonetheless touch us. This makes presence a post-linguistic or post-discursive theory that challenges current understandings of “meaning” and “interpretation.” Presence provides an overview of the concept and surveys both its weaknesses and its possible uses.\nIn this book, Ethan Kleinberg and Ranjan Ghosh bring together an interdisciplinary group of contributors to explore the possibilities and limitations of presence from a variety of perspectives—history, sociology, literature, cultural theory, media studies, photography, memory, and political theory. The book features critical engagements with the presence paradigm within intellectual history, literary criticism, and the philosophy of history. In three original case studies, presence illuminates the relationships among photography, the past, memory, and the Other. What these diverse but overlapping essays have in common is a shared commitment to investigate the attempt to reconnect meaning with something “real” and to push the paradigm of presence beyond its current uses. The volume is thus an important intervention in the most fundamental debates within the humanities today.\n\n\"Generation Existential: Heidegger’s Philosophy in France, 1927-1961\", 2005 Cornell University Press.

{"id": "19283877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19283877", "title": "Fabian Society", "text": "Fabian Society\n\nThe Fabian Society is a British socialist organisation whose purpose is to advance the principles of democratic socialism via gradualist and reformist effort in democracies, rather than by revolutionary overthrow. \n\nAs one of the founding organisations of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900, and as an important influence upon the Labour Party which grew from it, the Fabian Society has had a powerful influence on British politics. Other members of the Fabian Society have included political leaders from countries formerly part of the British Empire, such as Jawaharlal Nehru, who adopted Fabian principles as part of their own political ideologies. The Fabian Society founded the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1895.\n\nToday, the society functions primarily as a think tank and is one of 15 socialist societies affiliated with the Labour Party. Similar societies exist in Australia (the Australian Fabian Society), in Canada (the Douglas–Coldwell Foundation and the now disbanded League for Social Reconstruction), in Sicily (Sicilian Fabian Society) and in New Zealand (The NZ Fabian Society).\n\nThe Fabian Society was founded on 4 January 1884 in London as an offshoot of a society founded a year earlier called The Fellowship of the New Life. Early Fellowship members included the visionary Victorian elite, among them poets Edward Carpenter and John Davidson, sexologist Havelock Ellis, and early socialist Edward R. Pease. They wanted to transform society by setting an example of clean simplified living for others to follow. Some members also wanted to become politically involved to aid society's transformation; they set up a separate society, the Fabian Society. All members were free to attend both societies. The Fabian Society additionally advocated renewal of Western European Renaissance ideas and their promulgation throughout the world.\n\nThe Fellowship of the New Life was dissolved in 1899, but the Fabian Society grew to become the pre-eminent academic society in the United Kingdom in the Edwardian era. It was typified by the members of its vanguard Coefficients club. Public meetings of the Society were for many years held at Essex Hall, a popular location just off the Strand in central London.\n\nThe Fabian Society was named — at the suggestion of Frank Podmore — in honour of the Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (nicknamed \"Cunctator\", meaning the \"Delayer\"). His Fabian strategy sought gradual victory against the superior Carthaginian army under the renowned general Hannibal through persistence, harassment, and wearing the enemy down by attrition rather than pitched, climactic battles.\n\nAn explanatory note appearing on the title page of the group's first pamphlet declared:For the right moment you must wait, as Fabius did most patiently, when warring against Hannibal, though many censured his delays; but when the time comes you must strike hard, as Fabius did, or your waiting will be in vain, and fruitless.\n\nAccording to author Jon Perdue, \"The logo of the Fabian Society, a tortoise, represented the group’s predilection for a slow, imperceptible transition to socialism, while its coat of arms, a 'wolf in sheep’s clothing', represented its preferred methodology for achieving its goal.\" The wolf in sheep's clothing symbolism was later abandoned, due to its obvious negative connotations.\n\nIts nine founding members were Frank Podmore, Edward R. Pease, William Clarke, Hubert Bland, Percival Chubb, Frederick Keddell, H. H. Champion, Edith Nesbit, and Rosamund Dale Owen. Havelock Ellis is sometimes also mentioned as a tenth founding member, though there is some question about this.\n\nImmediately upon its inception, the Fabian Society began attracting many prominent contemporary figures drawn to its socialist cause, including George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Annie Besant, Graham Wallas, Charles Marson, Sydney Olivier, Oliver Lodge, Ramsay MacDonald and Emmeline Pankhurst. Even Bertrand Russell briefly became a member, but resigned after he expressed his belief that the Society's principle of entente (in this case, between countries allying themselves against Germany) could lead to war.\n\nAt the core of the Fabian Society were Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Together, they wrote numerous studies of industrial Britain, including alternative co-operative economics that applied to ownership of capital as well as land.\n\nMany Fabians participated in the formation of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900 and the group's constitution, written by Sidney Webb, borrowed heavily from the founding documents of the Fabian Society. At the meeting that founded the Labour Representation Committee in 1900, the Fabian Society claimed 861 members and sent one delegate.\n\nThe years 1903 to 1908 saw a growth in popular interest in the socialist idea in Great Britain and the Fabian Society grew accordingly, tripling its membership to nearly 2500 by the end of the period, half of whom were located in London. In 1912, a student section was organised called the University Socialist Federation (USF) and by the outbreak of World War I this contingent counted its own membership of more than 500.\n\nThe first Fabian Society pamphlets advocating tenets of social justice coincided with the zeitgeist of Liberal reforms during the early 1900s, including eugenics. The Fabian proposals however were considerably more progressive than those that were enacted in the Liberal reform legislation. The Fabians lobbied for the introduction of a minimum wage in 1906, for the creation of a universal health care system in 1911 and for the abolition of hereditary peerages in 1917.\n\nFabian socialists were in favour of reforming Britain's imperialist foreign policy as a conduit for internationalist reform, and were in favour of a capitalist welfare state modelled on the Bismarckian German model; they criticised Gladstonian liberalism both for its individualism at home and its internationalism abroad. They favoured a national minimum wage in order to stop British industries compensating for their inefficiency by lowering wages instead of investing in capital equipment; slum clearances and a health service in order for \"the breeding of even a moderately Imperial race\" which would be more productive and better militarily than the \"stunted, anaemic, demoralised denizens ... of our great cities\"; and a national education system because \"it is in the classrooms ... that the future battles of the Empire for commercial prosperity are already being lost\".\n\nIn 1900 the Society produced \"Fabianism and the Empire\", the first statement of its views on foreign affairs, drafted by Bernard Shaw and incorporating the suggestions of 150 Fabian members. It was directed against the liberal individualism of those such as John Morley and Sir William Harcourt. It claimed that the classical liberal political economy was outdated, and that imperialism was the new stage of the international polity. The question was whether Britain would be the centre of a world empire or whether it would lose its colonies and end up as just two islands in the North Atlantic. It expressed support for Britain in the Boer War because small nations, such as the Boers, were anachronisms in the age of empires. \n\nIn order to hold onto the Empire, the British needed to fully exploit the trade opportunities secured by war; maintain the British armed forces in a high state of readiness to defend the Empire; the creation of a citizen army to replace the professional army; the Factory Acts would be amended to extend to 21 the age for half-time employment, so that the thirty hours gained would be used in \"a combination of physical exercises, technical education, education in civil citizenship ... and field training in the use of modern weapons\".\n\nThe Fabians also favoured the nationalisation of land rent, believing that rents collected by landowners in respect of their land's value were unearned, an idea which drew heavily from the work of American economist Henry George.\n\nIn the period between the two World Wars, the \"Second Generation\" Fabians, including the writers R. H. Tawney, G. D. H. Cole and Harold Laski, continued to be a major influence on socialist thought.\nIt was at this time that many of the future leaders of the Third World were exposed to Fabian thought, most notably India's Jawaharlal Nehru, who subsequently framed economic policy for India on Fabian socialism lines. After independence from Britain, Nehru's Fabian ideas committed India to an economy in which the state owned, operated and controlled means of production, in particular key heavy industrial sectors such as steel, telecommunications, transportation, electricity generation, mining and real estate development. Private activity, property rights and entrepreneurship were discouraged or regulated through permits, nationalisation of economic activity and high taxes were encouraged, rationing, control of individual choices and Mahalanobis model considered by Nehru as a means to implement the Fabian Society version of socialism. In addition to Nehru, several pre-independence leaders in colonial India such as Annie Besant—Nehru's mentor and later a president of Indian National Congress – were members of the Fabian Society.\n\nObafemi Awolowo, who later became the premier of Nigeria's now defunct Western Region, was also a Fabian member in the late 1940s. It was the Fabian ideology that Awolowo used to run the Western Region during his premiership with great success, although he was prevented from using it in a similar fashion on the national level in Nigeria. It is less known that the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was an avid member of the Fabian Society in the early 1930s. Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore, stated in his memoirs that his initial political philosophy was strongly influenced by the Fabian Society. However, he later altered his views, considering the Fabian ideal of socialism as impractical. In 1993, Lee said:\n\nIn the Middle East, the theories of Fabian Society intellectual movement of early-20th-century Britain inspired the Ba'athist vision. The Middle East adaptation of Fabian socialism led the state to control big industry, transport, banks, internal and external trade. The state would direct the course of economic development, with the ultimate aim to provide a guaranteed minimum standard of living for all. Michel Aflaq, widely considered as the founder of the Ba'athist movement, was a Fabian socialist. Aflaq's ideas, with those of Salah al-Din al-Bitar and Zaki al-Arsuzi, came to fruition in the Arab world in the form of dictatorial regimes in Iraq and Syria. Salāmah Mūsā of Egypt, another prominent champion of Arab Socialism, was a keen adherent of Fabian Society, and a member since 1909.\n\nFabian academics of the late 20th-century included the political scientist Bernard Crick, the economists Thomas Balogh and Nicholas Kaldor and the sociologist Peter Townsend.\n\nThrough the course of the 20th century, the group has always been influential in Labour Party circles, with members including Ramsay MacDonald, Clement Attlee, Anthony Crosland, Roy Jenkins, Hugh Dalton, Richard Crossman, Ian Mikardo, Tony Benn, Harold Wilson and more recently Shirley Williams, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Gordon Marsden and Ed Balls. 229 Society members were elected to Parliament in the 1945 General Election. Ben Pimlott served as its chairman in the 1990s. (A Pimlott Prize for Political Writing was organised in his memory by the Fabian Society and \"The Guardian\" in 2005 and continues annually.) The Society is affiliated to the Party as a socialist society. In recent years the Young Fabian group, founded in 1960, has become an important networking and discussion organisation for younger (under 31) Labour Party activists and played a role in the 1994 election of Tony Blair as Labour Leader. Today there is also an active Fabian Women's Network and Scottish and Welsh Fabian groups.\n\nOn 21 April 2009 the Society's website stated that it had 6,286 members: \"Fabian national membership now stands at a 35 year high: it is over 20% higher than when the Labour Party came to office in May 1997. It is now double what it was when Clement Attlee left office in 1951\".\n\nThe latest edition of the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" (a reference work listing details of famous or significant Britons throughout history) includes 174 Fabians. Four Fabians, Beatrice and Sidney Webb, Graham Wallas, and George Bernard Shaw, founded the London School of Economics with the money left to the Fabian Society by Henry Hutchinson. Supposedly the decision was made at a breakfast party on 4 August 1894. The founders are depicted in the Fabian Window designed by George Bernard Shaw. The window was stolen in 1978 and reappeared at Sotheby's in 2005. It was restored to display in the Shaw Library at the London School of Economics in 2006 at a ceremony over which Tony Blair presided.\n\nAs of 2016, the Fabian Society had about 7,000 members.\n\nWith the advent of a Labour Party government in 1997, the Fabian Society was a forum for New Labour ideas and for critical approaches from across the party. The most significant Fabian contribution to Labour's policy agenda in government was Ed Balls's 1992 pamphlet, advocating Bank of England independence. Balls had been a \"Financial Times\" journalist when he wrote this Fabian pamphlet, before going to work for Gordon Brown. BBC Business Editor Robert Peston, in his book \"Brown's Britain\", calls this an \"essential tract\" and concludes that Balls \"deserves as much credit – probably more – than anyone else for the creation of the modern Bank of England\"; William Keegan offered a similar analysis of Balls's Fabian pamphlet in his book on Labour's economic policy, which traces in detail the path leading up to this dramatic policy change after Labour's first week in office.\n\nThe Fabian Society Tax Commission of 2000 was widely credited with influencing the Labour government's policy and political strategy for its one significant public tax increase: the National Insurance rise to raise £8 billion for National Health Service spending. (The Fabian Commission had in fact called for a directly hypothecated \"NHS tax\" to cover the full cost of NHS spending, arguing that linking taxation more directly to spending was essential to make tax rise publicly acceptable. The 2001 National Insurance rise was not formally hypothecated, but the government committed itself to using the additional funds for health spending.) Several other recommendations, including a new top rate of income tax, were to the left of government policy and not accepted, though this comprehensive review of UK taxation was influential in economic policy and political circles, and a new top rate of income tax of 50% was introduced in 2010.\n\nIn early 2017 Fabian general secretary, Andrew Harrop, produced a report arguing the only feasible route for Labour to return to government would be to work with the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party. Based on then-current polling, it predicted Labour would win fewer than 200 seats in the next general election, the lowest since 1935, due to Brexit, lack of support in Scotland, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s purported unpopularity. This prediction was proven false in the general election later in 2017 in which Labour won 262 seats.\n\nThe major influence on the Labour Party and on the English-speaking socialist movement worldwide, has meant that Fabianism became one of the main inspirations of international social democracy. An American Fabian Society was established in Boston in February 1895 by the Reverend W. D. P. Bliss, a prominent Christian socialist. The group published a periodical, \"The American Fabian\", and issued a small series of pamphlets. Around the same time a parallel organization emerged on the Pacific coast, centred in California, under the influence of socialist activist Laurence Gronlund.\n\nDirect or indirect Fabian influence may also be seen in the liberal socialism of Carlo Rosselli (founder, with his brother Nello Rosselli, of the anti-fascist group's Giustizia e Libertà) and all its derivatives such as the Action Party in Italy.\nThe Community Movement, created by the socialist entrepreneur Adriano Olivetti, was then the only Italian party which referred explicitly to Fabianism, among his main inspirations along with federalism, social liberalism, fighting partitocracy and social democracy.\n\nDuring 2000 the Sicilian Fabian Society was founded in Messina.\n\nIt is written into the rules of the society that it has no policies. All the publications carry a disclaimer saying that they do not represent the collective views of the society but only the views of the authors. \"No resolution of a political character expressing an opinion or calling for action, other than in relation to the running of the Society itself, shall be put forward in the name of the Society.\"\n\nThe Fabian Society is governed by an elected executive committee. The committee consists of 10 ordinary members elected from a national list, three members nationally elected from a list nominated by local groups, representatives from the Young Fabians, Fabians Women's Network and Scottish and Welsh Fabians. There is also one staff representative and a directly elected honorary treasurer from the membership. Elections are held every other year, with the exception of the Young Fabians and staff representation which are elected annually. The committee meet quarterly and elect a chair and at least one vice-chair annually to conduct its business. The current chair of the Fabian Society is Kate Green.\n\nThe Fabian Society have a number of employees based in their headquarters in London. The secretariat is led by a general secretary, who is the organisation's CEO. The staff are arranged into departments including Research, Editorial, Events and Operations.\n\nSince 1960 members aged under 31 years of age are also members of the Young Fabians. This group has its own elected Chair, executive committee and sub-groups. The Young Fabians are a voluntary organisation that serves as an incubator for member-led activities such as policy and social events, pamphlets and delegations. Within the group are five special interest communities called Networks that are run by voluntary steering groups and elect their own Chair and officers. The current Networks are Finance, Health, International Affairs, Education and Communications (Industry). It also publishes the quarterly magazine \"Anticipations\".\n\nAll female members of the Fabian Society are also members of the Fabian Women's Network. This group has its own elected Chair and Executive Committee which organises conferences and events and works with the wider political movement to secure increased representation for women in politics and public life. It has a flagship mentoring programme that recruits on an annual basis and its president is Seema Malhotra, a Labour Party and Co-operative MP. The Network also publishes the quarterly magazine, \"Fabiana\", runs a range of public speaking events, works closely in partnership with a range of women's campaigning organisations and regularly hosts a fringe at the Labour Party conference.\n\nThere are 45 local Fabian societies across the UK, bringing Fabian debates to communities around the country. Many of these are affiliated to their local constituency Labour party and have their own executive bodies. These local branches are affiliated to the national Fabians and local members have same voting rights as their national counterparts.\n\nIn the early 1900s Fabian Society members advocated the ideal of a scientifically planned society and supported eugenics by way of sterilisation. In an article published in \"The Guardian\" on 14 February 2008 (following the apology offered by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to the \"stolen generations\"), Geoffrey Robertson criticised Fabian socialists for providing the intellectual justification for the eugenics policy that led to the stolen generations scandal. Similar claims have been repeated in \"The Spectator\". However, these views on eugenics were not limited to one group of people and were widely shared throughout the political spectrum.\n\nAlthough H. G. Wells was a member of the Fabian Society from 1903 to 1908, he was a critic of its operations, particularly in his 1905 paper \"The Faults of the Fabian\" and parodied the society in his 1910 novel \"The New Machiavelli\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54011782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54011782", "title": "Georg Arnold Heise", "text": "Georg Arnold Heise\n\nGeorg Arnold Heise (2 August 1778 - 6 February 1851) was an influential German legal scholar. He served as president of the (Lübeck based) for more than three decades and is identified in certain academic circles as a leading representative of the 19th century German Historical School of Jurisprudence. \n\nGeorg Arnold Heise was born in Hamburg. He was the eldest of his parents' nine recorded children: after his mother died in 1801 his father remarried and a further three children appeared. His father; Johann Ludwig Barthold Heise (1749-1812), was a Hamburg merchant who lost his wealth thanks to the ruinous economic impact of the world war (as it was frequently known at the time). The father had to abandon his business in 1799 and take employment as a legally authorized agent (\"Bevollmächtigter\") with an asset management company. Heise's mother, born Maria Anna Behrmann, came from a major Hamburg mercantile family. \n\nInitially Heise was schooled at home, alongside his younger brothers. An early tutor was Paul Lorenz Cropp, a Lutheran pastor and the father of who subsequently became Heise's colleague and a personal friend. Later he attended the commercially oriented secondary school run by Johann Georg Büsch, concluding his schooling at a Hamburg Gymnasium (secondary school). Sources suggest that early on he aspired to a career as an engineer, but because of his diminutive stature this was felt to be impractical. Instead, encouraged by his uncle, the Hamburg Senator (and later city mayor) , he decided to study Jurisprudence (as his uncle had done) at university. In 1798 he enrolled at the University of Jena where he became part of a network of students who would continue as friends throughout their - in several instances notable - careers. A couple of years after this he transferred to Göttingen which is where, early in 1802, he received his doctorate for a dissertation on laws governing inheritance, entitled \"de successoribus necessariis\". \n\nDirectly after receiving his doctorate, in March 1802 he took teaching work at Göttingen's \"Spruchcollegium\" where, starting after Easter 1803, he worked as a lecturer on contract and civil law. As matters turned out he did not stay at Göttingen for long. The lecture topics were chosen more as a result of academic necessity than as any reflection of his own particular inclinations, but his lectures were nevertheless well received, so that early in 1804 he found himself with a professorship at Jena. In the summer of the same year, through the intervention of Friedrich Carl von Savigny, one of his university friends, Heise received and accepted an invitation to become a visiting professor in church law at Heidelberg University in the summer of 1804. \n\nDuring the ten years that he now spent at Heidelberg, Heise established for himself a reputation for academic brilliance, both through his teaching and through specialist articles and other written work. He also played a central role in building up the law department at the university in the face of widespread economic challenges resulting from the war. Directly before settling in Heidelberg, however, he married Sophia Georgina Elisabeth \"Betty\" Isenbart, the daughter of a colonel from Hanover whom he had met in the house of his friend . \n\nIn 1814 he returned from Heidelberg to Göttingen, taking a post as Professor of Roman Law. He enjoyed great success as a teacher of Pandectic and Commercial law. At the same time, following moves towards standardisation of laws under Napoleon, the future of the legal underpinnings and structures were subjects of intense and at times polarised discussion, reflecting the rapid political, economic and social changes of the period: Heise's published contributions were increasingly acknowledged by supporters and opponents alike in academic and legal circles. \n\nNevertheless, he stayed at Göttingen only for four years before moving again, towards the end of 1818, this time to his wife's home city of Hanover. He now gave up teaching and embarked on a new career in public service, taking a job as a senior advocate (\"Vortragender Rat\") in the regional justice department. Göttingen University had recently been granted the right to nominate member of parliament. In 1819 Heise was nominated by the university as a member of the lower chamber of the of the kingdom. However, he had already let it be known that were the opportunity to arise he would welcome the chance to move back to his own home city, Hamburg, where following the ending of the French occupation, was also very much on the agenda. \n\nArticle 12 (Section 3) of the 1815 constitution had provided for the right of the \"four free cities to establish a joint high court\". The \"free cities\" in question were Bremen, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg and Lübeck. After a certain amount of jostling between the politicians involved, the was established in Lübeck in 1820. With effect from its inauguration on 12 November 1820, Georg Arnold Heise accepted the invitation to become the court's first president. The court endured for nearly sixty years, replaced only in 1879 under the provisions of the of 1877, enacted in the aftermath of unification. Heise was in charge of it for slightly more than half of the period covered by its existence. Under his leadership its reputation grew within and beyond the \"four free cities\", as it was appointed to arbitrate in cases involving intergovernmental disputes between other component states of the German Confederation.\n\nThe distinguished jurist Bernhard Windscheid wrote later than for an ambitious [German] jurist of Heise's generation there were really only two jobs to covet. One was to succeed Savigny, who was central to the establishment of a modern legal system in Prussia, and the other, in Windscheid's opinion, would be to take on Heise's job. Many of the court decisions under Heise's presidency developed commercial law decisively, and in some cases achieved lasting influence as precedents. Heise's influence as an academic lawyer reached far beyond his own students thanks, in large measure, to the influence of his written work. This is particularly the case with his much re-printed Pandectist lectures.\n"}

He was a professor at the University of Belgrade.\n\nOstrogorsky was born at Saint Petersburg, Imperial Russia, the son of a secondary school principal and a writer on pedagogical subjects.\n\nHe completed his secondary education in a St. Petersburg classical gymnasium and thus acquired knowledge of Greek early in life. He began his university studies in Heidelberg, Germany (1921), where he devoted himself initially to philosophy, economics, and sociology, though he also took classes in classical archeology. His teachers included Karl Jaspers, Heinrich Rickert, Alfred Weber and Ludwig Curtius. His interest in history, especially Byzantine history, was awakened by a young Dozent by the name of Percy Ernst Schramm. After studying various aspects of Byzantinology in Paris (1924–25), Ostrogorsky received his doctorate from the University of Heidelberg (1927) with a dissertation in which he combined his interests in economics and Byzantine history. He then taught as Privatdozent in Breslau from 1928 and moved to Belgrade in 1933.\n\nOstrogorsky taught at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, where he was the Chair for Byzantinology.\n\nOstrogorsky made the Kingdom of Yugoslavia his permanent home and taught at Belgrade for 40 years until his retirement in 1973, leaving the Chair for Byzantinology to Božidar Ferjančić. He was made a corresponding Member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1946 and a Regular Member two years later. An Institute of Byzantinology was created within the Academy in 1948 with himself as director, a post he held until his death. He was chief editor of the Institute's house organ, the Zbornik radova Vizantološkog instituta, through its 16th volume which appeared in 1975. He also supervised the monograph series of the Institute of which the choice items were his own study \"Pronija\" (1951) and the multivolume collection of Byzantine Sources for the History of the Nations of Yugoslavia.\n\nOstrogorsky repaid in more than one way the hospitality he met with in his new country; he created a new generation of Yugoslav Byzantinists, broadened the horizons of Yugoslav historians by the example of his personal research, and provided for them closer contacts with the world scholarly community. Under his guidance the Belgrade Institute became, along with Munich, Paris, and Dumbarton Oaks, a leading center of research in the field of Byzantinology. Ostrogorsky remained faithful to Belgrade to the very end, although over the years suggestions were made that he take up residence in an American or Soviet center of Byzantine studies.\n\nHis best-known work was the standard \"History of the Byzantine State\" (), a work which saw three German editions (1940, 1952, 1963) and two editions in English language (1st ed. 1956 (UK) and 1957 (USA), 2nd ed. 1968 (UK) and 1969 (USA)), and translations into more than 10 other languages.\n\nOstrogorsky died at Belgrade in 1976.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "966049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=966049", "title": "Germanic verb", "text": "Germanic verb\n\nThe Germanic language family is one of the language groups that resulted from the breakup of Proto-Indo-European (PIE). It in turn divided into North, West and East Germanic groups, and ultimately produced a large group of mediaeval and modern languages, most importantly: Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish (North); English, Frisian, Dutch and German (West); and Gothic (East, extinct).\n\nThe Germanic verb system lends itself to both descriptive (synchronic) and historical (diachronic) comparative analysis. This overview article is intended to lead into a series of specialist articles discussing historical aspects of these verbs, showing how they developed out of PIE, and how they came to have their present diversity.\n\nThe Germanic verb system carried two innovations over the previous Proto-Indo-European verb system:\nLater Germanic languages developed further tenses periphrastically, that is, using auxiliary verbs, but the constituent parts of even the most elaborate periphrastic constructions are still only either in present or preterite tenses (or non-finite forms: cf \"I would have been doing\", an English conditional perfect progressive with \"would\" in the preterite, the other three parts being non-finite).\n\nGermanic verbs fall into two broad types, strong and weak. Elements of both are present in the preterite-present verbs. Despite various irregularities, most verbs fall into one of these categories. Suppletive verbs are completely irregular, being composed of parts of more than one Indo-European verb. There is one verb (*\"dōną\" 'to do') that is in a category of its own, based on an Indo-European \"athematic\" form, and having a \"weak\" preterite but a \"strong\" passive participle.\n\nStrong (or vocalic) verbs display vowel gradation or ablaut, and may also be reduplicating. These are the direct descendants of the verb in Proto-Indo-European, and are paralleled in other Indo-European languages such as Greek: \"leipo\" \"leloipa\" \"elipon\" ('to leave'). All Indo-European verbs that passed into Germanic as functioning verbs were strong, apart from the small group of irregular verbs discussed below.\n\nExamples in Old English:\n\n\nOr Old High German:\n\n\nIn Proto-Germanic consonant alternations known as \"grammatischer Wechsel\" developed, as a result of Verner's law. An example in modern Dutch:\n\n\nThe preterite of strong verbs are the reflex of the Indo-European perfect. Because the perfect in late Indo-European was no longer simply stative, but began to be used especially of stative actions whose source was a completed action in the past (e.g. Greek), this anterior aspect of it was emphasized in a couple of Indo-European daughter languages (e.g. Latin), and so it was with Germanic that the perfect came to be used as a simple past tense. The semantic justification for this change is that actions of stative verbs generally have an implied prior inception. An example of this is the typical and widespread PIE stative \"*woida\" 'I know': one who \"knows\" something at some point in the past \"came to know\" it, much as the natural inference from noting someone in a sitting state is that a prior action of becoming seated occurred. The classical/Koine Greek perfect is essentially an early step in the development of the stative aspect to a past tense, being a hybrid of the two that emphasizes the ongoing (present/stative) effects of a past action (e.g. \"leloipa\" 'I have left\"). Apparently it was this latter anterior respect that is responsible for the Indo-European perfect showing up as a past tense in Germanic, Italic, and Celtic.\n\nThe Indo-European perfect took o-grade in the singular and zero grade in the dual and plural. The Germanic strong preterite shows the expected Germanic development of short \"o\" to short \"a\" in the singular and zero grade in the plural; these make up the second and third principal parts of the strong verb. The Indo-European perfect originally carried its own set of personal endings, the remnants of which are seen in the Germanic strong preterite. The reduplication characteristic of the Indo-European perfect remains in a number of verbs (seen most clearly in Gothic), a distinction by which they are grouped together as the seventh class of Germanic strong verbs.\n\nWeak (or consonantal) verbs are those that use a dental suffix in the past or \"preterite\" tense, either \"-t-\" or \"-d-\". In Proto-Germanic such verbs had no ablaut—that is, all forms of all tenses were formed from the same stem, with no vowel alternations within the stem. This meant that weak verbs were \"simpler\" to form, and as a result strong verbs gradually ceased to be productive. Already in the earliest attested Germanic languages strong verbs had become essentially closed classes, and almost all new verbs were formed using one of the weak conjugations. This pattern later repeated itself—further sound changes meant that stem alternations appeared in some weak classes in some daughter languages, and these classes generally became unproductive. This happened, for example, in all of the West Germanic languages besides Old High Germanic, where umlaut produced stem alternations in Class III weak verbs, and as a result the class became unproductive and most of its verbs were transferred to other classes. Later, in Middle English, stem alternations between long and short vowels appeared in Class I weak verbs (examples are \"meet\" vs. \"met\" and \"hear\" vs. \"heard\"), and the class in its turn became unproductive, leaving the original Class II as the only productive verb class in Modern English.\n\nIn Proto-Germanic, there were five main classes of weak verbs:\n\nThe so-called preterite-present verbs are a small group of anomalous verbs in the Germanic languages in which the present tense shows the form of the strong preterite. The preterite of the preterite-present verbs is weak. As an example, take the third-person forms of modern German \"können\" \"to be able to\". \"Kann\" \"can, is able to\" (present tense) displays the vowel change and lack of a personal ending that would otherwise mark a strong preterite. \"Konn-te\" \"could, was able to\" (preterite) displays the dental suffix of the weak preterites.\n\nAccording to one \"widely-held view\", the preterite-present verbs are derived from the Proto-Indo-European perfect. The PIE perfect usually developed into a Germanic past tense; in the case of the preterite-presents, however, it evolved into a present-tense verb. Hence, the preterite-presents have a present-tense meaning on the one hand and a form that resembles that of a preterite or past-tense verb on the other.\n\nReconstructions of this process differ depending on how they interpret the PIE perfect. An example is the PIE perfect *\"\". It is the ancestor of the Germanic preterite-presents meaning \"(s/he) knows\", represented here by Gothic \"wait\":\n\nOne response to these and other problems has been to argue that the preterite-presents are instead the descendents of a separate PIE stative category, from which the stative-resultative PIE perfect was also derived. This approach allows the preterite-presents to be treated as purely stative in origin without depriving the PIE perfect of a temporal element. \n\nThe known verbs in Proto-Germanic (PGmc):\n\nThe present tense has the form of a vocalic (strong) preterite, with vowel-alternation between singular and plural. A new weak preterite is formed with a dental suffix. The root shape of the preterite (in zero-grade) serves as the basis for the infinitive and past passive participle, thus Gothic inf. \"witan\" and past participle \"witans\"; this contrasts with all other Germanic verb types, in which the basis for those forms is the present stem.\n\nFor the most part, the personal endings of the strong preterite are used for the present tense. In fact, in West Germanic the endings of the present tense of preterite-present verbs represent the original IE perfect endings better than that subgroup's strong preterite verbs do: the expected PGmc strong preterite 2 sg. form ending in \"-t\" was retained rather than replaced by the endings \"-e\" or \"-i\" elsewhere adopted for strong preterites in West Germanic.\n\nThe endings of the preterite (except for *\"kunnana\") are the same as the endings of the first weak class.\n\nIn modern English, preterite-present verbs are identifiable by the absence of an -s suffix on the 3rd person singular present tense form. Compare, for instance, \"he can\" with \"he sings\" (pret. \"he sang\"); the present paradigm of \"can\" is thus parallel with the past tense of a strong verb. (See English modal verb.) In modern German there is also an ablaut shift between singular \"ich kann\" (I can) and plural \"wir können\" (we can). In the older stages of the Germanic languages (Old English, Middle High German) the past tense of strong verbs also showed different ablaut grades in singular and plural.\n\nMany of the preterite-present verbs function as modal verbs (auxiliaries which are followed by a bare infinitive, without \"to\" in English, and which convey modality) and indeed most of the traditional modal verbs are preterite-presents. Examples are English \"must\" and \"shall/should\", German \"dürfen\" (may), \"sollen\" (ought), \"mögen\" (like), and \"müssen\" (must). The early history of \"will\" (German \"wollen\") is more complicated, as it goes back to an Indo-European optative mood, but the result in the modern languages is likewise a preterite-present paradigm.\n\nA small number of Germanic verbs show the phenomenon of suppletion, that is, they are made up from more than one stem. In English, there are two of these: \"to be\" and \"to go\".\n\nThe copula (the verb \"to be\" and its equivalents in the other languages) has its forms from four IE roots (\"*es-\", \"*er-\", \"*bʰu-\" and \"*wes-\").\n\nThe phenomenon of verb paradigms being composites of parts of different earlier verbs can best be observed in an example from recorded language history. The English verb \"to go\" was always suppletive, having the past tense \"ēode\" in Old English (this is believed to represent the original Proto-Germanic situation \"*gāną\" \"to go\" ~ \"*ijjǭ\" \"I went\", \"*ijjēdum\" \"we went\"). In the 15th century, however, this was replaced by a new irregular past tense \"went\". In fact \"went\" is originally the past tense of the verb \"to wend\" (compare \"wend\"~\"went\" with \"send\"~\"sent\"); today \"wend\" has the regular past tense \"wended\". In most other modern Germanic languages the verb \"go\" takes its preterite from the Proto-Germanic verb \"*ganganą\" \"to walk\" (e.g. German \"gehen\", \"ging\"; Dutch \"gaan\", \"ging\"; Swedish \"gå\", \"gick\").\n\nA special case is *\"wiljaną\" (to want, will), which has its present forms from an IE optative. Today, only Faroese retains the optative, though it is confined to the present tense and used only as a conjunctive.\n\nWhen teaching modern languages, it is usually most useful to have a narrow definition of a \"regular verb\" and treat all other groups as irregular. See the article irregular verb. Thus for example, most text books for learning English or German treat all strong verbs as irregular, and only the most straightforward weak verb counts as regular. In historical linguistics, however, regular patterns are examined diachronically, and verbs tend only to be described as \"irregular\" when such patterns cannot be found. Most of the supposedly \"irregular\" Germanic verbs belong to historical categories that are regular within their own terms. However, the suppletive verbs are irregular by any standard, and for most purposes the preterite-presents can also count as irregular. Beyond this, isolated irregularities occur in all Germanic languages in both the strong and the weak verb system.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "356253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=356253", "title": "J. Eric S. Thompson", "text": "J. Eric S. Thompson\n\nSir John Eric Sidney Thompson, KBE (31 December 1898 – 9 September 1975) was a leading English Mesoamerican archaeologist, ethnohistorian, and epigrapher. While working in the United States, he dominated Maya studies and particularly the study of the Maya script until well into the sixties of the 20th century.\n\nThompson was born on 31 December 1898 to father George Thompson, a distinguished surgeon and fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Thompson was raised in the family home on Harley Street in London. At the age of 14 he was sent to Winchester College to receive an independent education.\n\nIn 1915, at the beginning of World War I, Thompson used the assumed name Neil Winslow to join the British Army while underage. A year into service he was wounded and sent home to recover, first in Huddersfield then Seaford. He continued to serve in the Coldstream Guards until the end of the war, ending his service at the rank of officer.\nAfter the war Thompson left for Argentina to work as a gaucho on a family cattle farm. When he returned to England in the early 1920s Thompson published his first article on his experience in Argentina, titled \"A Cowboy's Experience: Cattle Branding in the Argentine\" in the Southwark Diocesan Gazette.\n\nThompson first considered a medical or political career. However, he later decided to study anthropology at Fitzwilliam House, Cambridge under A.C. Haddon. With the completion of his degree in 1925 Thompson wrote to Sylvanus G Morley, the head of the Carnegie Institution's project at Chichen Itza, to ask for a job, inquiring about a field position. Morley accepted Thompson, most likely due to the fact that Thompson had previously taught himself to read Maya hieroglyphic dates, an accomplishment that was highly valued by Morley who also had a passion for Maya hieroglyphics.\n\nIn 1926 Thompson arrived in the Yucatan of Mexico under the direction of Morley to work at Chichen Itza. Here he started working on the friezes of the Temple of the Warriors. In his autobiography, Maya Archaeologist (1936), Thompson referred to the friezes as \"a sort of giant jigsaw puzzle made worse by the fact the stones had been carved before being placed in position\" accurately describing his first field experience.\n\nLater that year Morley sent Thompson to report on the site of Coba, located to the east of Chichen Itza. During the first field season at Coba, Thompson deciphered the dates on the Macanxoc stela. Morley, the foremost epigrapher, did not originally agree with the readings of the dates. It was not until a return trip to Coba that Morley was persuaded by Thompson's readings, marking his emergence as a prominent scholar in the field of Maya epigraphy. Within the next year, Thompson took post as the Assistant Curator at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. He would work there until 1935 when he left for a position at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C.\nIn 1926, while employed by the Field Museum, Thompson, under the supervision of Thomas A. Joyce and the British Museum, took part in an expedition to Lubaantun in British Honduras. It was the fieldwork at Lubaantun that lead Thompson to disagree with Joyce's argument for the early \"megalith\" and \"in-and-out\" style of architectural stratigraphy. Thompson argued that the \"in-and-out\" constructions were due to root action. This root action disturbed the construction by pushing the rocks out in the fashion of the \"in-and out\" construction that invalidated Joyce's argument.\n\nToward the end of the first season at Lubaantun, the site of Pusilha was discovered and Thompson was sent to investigate with his guide, Faustino Bol. Thompson's subsequent interactions with his guide, who was a Mopan Maya, would later shed light on how Thompson viewed the ancient Maya and their culture. As a result of their long conversations, Thompson concluded that is \"was clear that archaeological excavations were not the only means of learning about the ancient ways.\" This led to his first monograph, \"Ethnology of the Mayas of Southern and Central British Honduras\"(1930) which gave insight into the problems of Maya archaeological and epigraphic through the use of ethnographic and ethno-historic data.\nIn 1931, Thompson and Gann teamed up to publish \"The History of the Maya from the Earliest Times to the Present Day\". Additionally, Thompson started on a new field project at the site of San Jose in Belize. Here his research was focused at an \"average\" Maya center in which the stratigraphy produced a ceramic sequence from the Preclassic Period to the Terminal Classic Period. The field report, published in 1939, contained Anna O. Shepard's appendix on the temporal changes in ceramic material, which was the first use of \"archaeological sciences\". \nThompson was able to produce ceramic sequences at the sites of Tzimin Kax, San Jose, and Xunantunich. These sequences allowed for sites which lacked inscribed monuments traditionally used for dating, to produce a tentative date. The patterns presented by the data from the Petén region and Uaxactun allowed for these sites to fit within the cultural development of the Maya lowlands. In 1938, Thompson added to ceramic sequence, the discovery of the site of La Milpa. This sequence would hold strong until Gordon Willey's research at Barton Ramie, which would lead to a sequence. The field season at La Milpa would be one of the last ones for Thompson, though he was not aware of this at the time of his publication of \"Maya Archaeologist\".\n\nWhile Thompson continued to publish on chronology, during the 1940s his main goal was to decipher the non-calendric hieroglyphs which composed the majority of the unread texts. Of the eight papers he published in 1943, half were on epigraphic research. Thompson's particular epigraphic focus was on the fish symbol and directional glyphs. Additionally, outside of epigraphy, Thompson investigated tattooing and tobacco use by the ancient Maya.\n\nIn \"The Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization,\" Arthur Demerast characterizes Thompson as engendering a traditional view of Maya society or essentially one of \"gentlemen scholars\" of the earlier part of the 20th century. This perspective stems from an elitist tradition is biased since it presents the Maya myopically. Additionally Thompson presented the Maya as practicing slash and burn agriculture since it fit well into models which presented the Maya as dispersed people. Thompson depicted the Maya public life as being solely centered on \"theocratic\" ceremonial centers dedicated to worship of great cycles of time and celestial bodies; a view that is now considered an oversimplification. With the help of Dr. A.V. Kidder, Thompson (1943) wrote, \"A Trial Survey of the Southern Maya Area\", describing sites, such as; Kaminaljuyui, Miraflores, and Copan. The article by Thompson assumes that the Maya were ultimately \"peaceful\" people since they lacked apparent defenses. He again stresses the widespread abandonment of ceremonial centers. He refers to the decline in arts and architecture as \"Balkanization,\" a period which he views as experiencing political disintegration. He is also responsible for the long-held belief that the Aztecs, a \"highly war-like\" society according to the text, were directly involved in overthrowing what he thought were priest-rulers.\n\nThompson was an accomplished author, publishing text books and findings in academic journals all over the United States. In his article, \"A Survey of the North Maya Area\", Thompson (1945) describes how researchers ought to employ a historical framework in archaeological studies. Additionally he details his finds in the Northern Maya region whilst making suggestions as to which types of ceramics were adopted. He identified phases: the formative period, the Initial Series, transition period, Mexican period, and Mexican absorption period, in Maya development which set a precedent for the field in a number of ways.\n\nHe theorized that the formative period began prior to A.D. 325 and was characterized by monochrome pottery in Chicanel style as well as giant pyramids. However he believed that the Maya did not have any carved stelae during this point in history. Currently, it is believed that the Preclassic period actually occurred earlier than Thompson originally surmised. The Initial Series period is prostrated as the Classic phase in Maya ceramic styles. He grouped them into two halves. The first half 325 A.D. to 625 is characterized by basal flange bowls, and hieroglyphic stelae and lintels in mostly centralized areas. The second half 625 A.D. to 900 is indicative of Z fine orange ware, and slate wares. In addition, Puuc, Chenes, and Rio Bec\nbegan to develop distinct styles.The Transition period 900 A.D. to 987 the Mayanist felt that there were no identifiable pottery types, he remarked on the fall of Chichen Itza, the abandonment of Puuc/Chenes/Rio Bec, and how Mexican influences were becoming stronger. According to Thompson, the Mexican period marked a decline in Maya civilization and ceramic styles due to conflict between Mesoamerican polities. He postulated that this era saw an end to hieroglyphic texts and increased worship of Mexican cosmology in place of Maya deities. The architectural styles were a mix of Tula and Maya features. He also claimed that the Mexican Absorption Period 1204 A.D. to 1540 was characterized by the abandonment of most major cities, and that artistic innovation only were produced at low levels.\n\nAlthough Thompson has contributed a considerable amount of research to Mesoamerican studies his interpretations have been proven to be flawed or inconsistent with new investigations. He maintained a venerable air of dissent in the archaeological community. Archaeologist Jeremiah Epstein posed that Thompson was wrong in his characterization of the Maya water transportation. He may have based his analysis of misinterpreted Spanish translations of the Motul Maya word for sail. \"Bub\" is a 16th-century Spanish interpretation, but may characterize Spanish vessels as opposed to Maya. Sails are not represented in prehistoric Mesoamerican iconography or texts, instead, it is theorized that canoes were used as a primary mode of water transportation for the ancient Maya. In fact, the only place where sails allegedly appear to be represented in prehistoric contexts are in graffiti at Tikal, however, further research poses that the illustration does not depicts sails since there is no supplemental evidence of marine life or water sources (191). In addition, Maya numerous texts make no historical references to sails; they may not have been very utilitarian for the Maya, instead, the overwhelming majority of sources refer to canoes. It appears that Thompson did not consider a Post Conquest context for sails.\n\nAnother author Matthew Watson portrays Thompson as a significant figure in Mesoamerican studies, however, in conjunction with Bruno Latour, the author believes that the famous Mayanist, along with Merle Green Robertson, and Linda Schele used specific techniques known as \"mechanical objectivity\" and \"trained judgement\" which essentially reduces the diversity of Maya artistic traditions to that of modernist texts. This approach ignores a context-driven archaeological empiricism, adding to Thompson's many biased assumptions about how the ancient Maya lived.\n\nMoreover, archaeologist Traci Ardren feels that Thompson appeared to have made the mistake of conflating, or merging several cosmological entities into one. He famously misinterpreted the Maya Moon Goddess Ix Chel, basing his research again on mistranslated Spanish texts. He believed as modern Maya do now that the Moon Goddess is the wife of the Sun God. Ardren's article claims, \"Thompson interpreted the different glyphic phrases or names associated with the younger set as various tides for the same goddess, a deity he had already assumed to represent the moon\". Ardren recognizes that the concept an all-encompassing, unifying female entity is directly influenced by western philosophical movements and androcentric bias.\n\nIn tandem with other critics, Becker (1979) reviews Thompson's assumptions about Classic Maya settlement patterns and social structure and how his influence affected later theories regarding complexity in Mesoamerican culture. His article describes scholars; such as Gaan, who critiqued Thompson's work. Gann and Thompson would later coauthor a text in which \"Thompson stated...his popularized idea that the Maya lived in small agricultural settlements while the religious centers were uninhabited, while Gann suggested just the opposite. This divergence from the complex model, however, only appeared in Thompson's popular work.\" Furthermore, Becker characterizes more modern research as integrative, enabling studies to connect emerging insights about Maya urbanization/complexity with supportive archaeological evidence. Becker concludes that Thompson's research was both incomplete and incorrect, however, contemporary research is fighting to correct false claims in conjunction with other disciplines. The article distinguishes between two major theoretical concepts that dominated Maya archaeology for decades; Thompson's \"priest-peasant\" hypothesis and Borgheyi's concept of ranked social classes. Becker deconstructs Thompson's biased narratives, considering them to be a product of Thompson's English heritage and socio-political orientation which he later projected on to his research. Borgheyi's hypothesis is considered as more indicative of what Maya society might actually be like as opposed to Thompson whose claims were generally viewed as unfounded. Additionally, Becker mentions how defining \"limits\" often creates interpretive issues for scholars, it is an important observation in a whole range of archaeological settings; still affecting research today.\n\nUnfortunately, Thompson's assumptions about Maya elites were misguided. Husband and wife archaeologist team Chase and Chase discusses the significance of the Caracol Archaeological Project which recently celebrated its 30th consecutive year of field research. Their research reveals the inconsistent interpretations of past Mayanists like Thompson. Thomspon proposed that the Maya socially organized themselves around a two-tiered class system; a view prostrated by Harvard academic traditions. As of current, Caracol is recognized as being essential to evaluating urbanization and large-scale organization of Maya cities. Representing the Penn State academic tradition, Chase and Chase specifically describe how, upon their initial arrival at the site, two theoretical framework purported by Thompson and Borgheyi dominated Caracol, but were later rejected because of evidence stemming from long-term research. The authors found that divisions between elites and lower classes were not as stark or simply as previously suggested, moreover, there is evidence for a prominent middle-class which Thompson did not consider. Ultimately, Thompson did not have access to accurate population estimates or entire maps of settlement patterns, making it difficult for him to assess realistic organizational principles of the Maya.\n\nNonetheless, the Mayanist knew the limitations of archaeological research. One of Thompson's later articles \"Estimates of Maya Population: Deranging Factors\" is an attempt to identify deranging factors for population estimates of the ancient Maya. Determining population sizes is still an issue that plagues archaeologists (214). He draws attention to the ancient Maya tendency to \"abandon\" a hut after the death of its owner which may invariably skew population estimates. Additionally, Thompson writes about the mobilizing capabilities of the ancient Maya and their long-standing tradition of moving from site to site in order to exploit local resources. Using the modern Maya as an example, he urged other archaeologists to consider hut-abandonment, and movement as major issues. In fact, determining whether or not a site is continuously occupied is still a huge part of archaeological limits today. Moreover, Thompson contends that house-moving was not a major issues for the Maya since building materials were abundant (215). In his conclusion he feels that mounds also may be an indication of decreased population sizes and a time of \"growing unrest.\"\n\nThompson's focus on the non-calendric hieroglyphs produced the monumental Carnegie monograph \"Maya Hieroglyphic Writing: Introduction\". Thompson did groundbreaking work in the deciphering of Maya hieroglyphics. Notably, his contributions to the field of Maya epigraphic studies included advancements in our understanding of the calendar and astronomy, the identification of new nouns, and the development of a numerical cataloguing system for the glyphs (the T-number system), which are still used today. His attempted decipherments were based on ideographic rather than linguistic principles, and he was a staunch critic of all attempts to propose phonetic readings. In his later years, he resisted the notion that the glyphs have a phonetic component, as put forward by Russian linguist Yuri Knorozov. Thompson forcefully criticised Knorozov's research, which discouraged the majority of the field from taking the latter's work seriously.\n\nThompson wrote about hieroglyphic writing in great detail. \"In Systems of Hieroglyphic Writing in Middle America and Methods of Deciphering Them\", the famed Mayanist critiqued some of the historical inconsistencies associated with Landa's informants. He warned other archaeologists that the translation may be inaccurate since the informant through personal agency may have intentionally deceived the Spaniards or the informant did not supply material for reading Maya texts using syllabic systems because \"none existed\" at the time. He also scathingly claimed that Knorozov overwhelmingly misidentified Landa's hieroglyphs, adding to confusion. However it was later proven that many of Knorozov's speculations that the Maya language was phonetic and ideographic were accurate. Further discussed are Nahuatl language and writing where he again reasserted that the Maya did not have a phonetic language system, instead, he thought they only identified specific places and people (352). He thought that their writing had strong implications between good and bad. Furthermore, he characterized the preconquest Mexican codices as having a form of \"rebus\" writing (352-353). Thompson also expressed interest in the \"divinatory\" significance of the Dresden and Madrid codices (357).\n\nThompson supported Morley's contention that the inscriptions were purely esoteric and religious texts, with no elements of history or politics, until the early 1960s, when the work of Tatiana Proskouriakoff on the inscriptions of Piedras Negras made him realise that his view had been \"completely mistaken.\"\n\nThompson continued to work with epigraphic and ethnohistoric problems until the end of his career. As he himself noted, he belonged to the last generation of \"generalists\", engaging in activities ranging from finding and mapping new sites and excavation to the study of Maya ceramics, art, iconography, epigraphy, and ethnology (on the side). Thompson sought to present the Maya to the general public with publications such as the \"Rise and fall of the Maya Civilization\" (1954) and \"Maya Hieroglyphs without Tears\" (1972).\n\nThompson was awarded four honorary doctorates in three different countries, along with being awarded the Order of Isabel la Catolica by Spain, the Aztec Eagle by Mexico in 1965 and the Order of the Quetzal by Guatemala during his last trip to the Maya lands with the Queen of England in 1975. Thompson was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975 a few days after his 76th birthday, becoming the first New World archaeologist to receive this honoured distinction. He died nine months later on 9 September 1975 in Cambridge, and was laid to rest in Ashdon, Essex, England. Although parts of his legacy are now outdated, Thompson undoubtedly is one of the greatest Mayanists of the 20th century.\n\n\n"}

It is often used by civil law jurists to refer to those aspects of the civil law system's invariant legal principles, sometimes called \"the law of the land\" in English law. While the \"ius commune\" was a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all. (\"Ius commune\" is distinct from the term \"common law\" meaning the Anglo-American family of law as opposed to the civil law family.)\n\nThe phrase \"the common law of the civil law systems\" means those underlying laws that create a distinct legal system and are common to all its elements.\n\nThe \"\", in its historical meaning, is commonly thought of as a combination of canon law and Roman law which formed the basis of a common system of legal thought in Western Europe from the rediscovery and reception of Justinian's Digest in the 12th and 13th centuries. In addition to this definition, the term also possibly had a narrower meaning depending upon the context in which it was used. Some scholars believe that the term, when used in the context of the ecclesiastical courts of England in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, also \"meant the law that is common to the universal church, as opposed to the constitutions or special customs or privileges of any provincial church.\"\n\nThe ' was an actual part of the law in most areas, although in any one jurisdiction local laws (statutes and customs) could take precedence over the '. This was the case up until the codification movement in the late 18th and 19th centuries, which explicitly removed the direct applicability of Roman and canon law in most countries, although there continued to be argument about whether the \" was banished completely or survived where the national codes were silent.\n\nThe latter view prevailed, so it can still be said that there is, in theory at least, a common basis in substantive law throughout Western Europe (except England, which never had a reception as such) although it has of course fragmented greatly from its heyday in the 15th and 16th centuries. More important, however, is the civilian tradition of ways of thinking that the \" encouraged and the procedures it used, which have been more persistent than the actual substance.\n\nIn England, the law developed its own tradition separate from the rest of Europe based on its own common law. Scotland has a mixed civil and common law system. Scotland had a reception of Roman law and partial codification through the works of the Institutional Writers, such as Viscount Stair and Baron Hume, among others. Influence from England has meant that Scotland's current system is more common law than civilian, but there are areas which are still heavily based on Roman law, such as Scots property law.\n\n"}

It first appeared in print in 1961 in the \"Los Angeles Times\" in an article written by Henry J. Taylor. Outside the United States of America, analysts and commentators may refer to a similar phenomenon as political theatre.\n\nIn common English usage, a kabuki dance, also kabuki play, is an activity or drama carried out in real life in a predictable or stylized fashion, reminiscent of the Kabuki style of Japanese stage play. It refers to an event that is designed to create the appearance of conflict or of an uncertain outcome, when in fact the actors have worked together to determine the outcome beforehand. For example, Tom Brokaw used the term to describe U.S. Democratic party and U.S. Republican party political conventions, which purport to be competitive contests to nominate presidential candidates, yet in reality the nominees are known well beforehand.\n\nA more recent example of the use of this phrase by popular media is a \"Wall Street Journal\" article on the Supreme Court nomination hearing of Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

{"id": "49968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49968", "title": "Lviv", "text": "Lviv\n\nLviv ( ; \"\" ; ; ; ; see also other names) is the largest city in western Ukraine and the seventh-largest city in the country overall, with a population of around 728,350 as of 2016. Lviv is one of the main cultural centres of Ukraine.\n\nNamed in honor of Leo, the eldest son of Daniel, King of Ruthenia, it was the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia (also called the Kingdom of Ruthenia) from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King Casimir III the Great who then became known as the King of Poland and Ruthenia. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the Ruthenian Voivodeship in the Kingdom of Poland. In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland, the city became the capital of the Habsburg Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the West Ukrainian People's Republic. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the Lwów Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic.\n\nAfter the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Lviv became part of the Soviet Union, and in 1944–46 there was a population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine. In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.\n\nAdministratively, Lviv serves as the administrative center of Lviv Oblast and has the status of city of oblast significance.\n\nLviv was the centre of the historical regions of Red Ruthenia and Galicia. The historical heart of the city, with its old buildings and cobblestone streets, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The city has many industries and institutions of higher education such as Lviv University and Lviv Polytechnic. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet. The historic city centre is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\nBesides its Ukrainian name, the city is also known by several other names in different languages: ; , , ', or , '; , \"\"; ; ; ; ; ; see also .\n\nLviv is located on the edge of the Roztochia Upland, approximately 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the Polish border and 160 kilometers (99 miles) from the eastern Carpathian Mountains. The average altitude of Lviv is 296 meters (971 feet) above sea level. Its highest point is the \"Vysokyi Zamok\" (High Castle), 409 meters (1342 feet) above sea level. This castle has a commanding view of the historic city centre with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.\n\nThe old walled city was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the River Poltva. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, the Poltva was covered over in areas where it flows through the city; the river flows directly beneath the central street of Lviv, Freedom Avenue (\"Prospect Svobody\") and the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet.\n\nLviv's climate is humid continental (Köppen climate classification \"Dfb\") with cold winters and mild summers. The average temperatures are in January and in July. The average annual rainfall is with the maximum being in summer. Mean sunshine duration per year at Lviv is about 1,804 hours.\n\nArchaeologists have demonstrated that the Lviv area was settled by the 5th century. The area between the Castle Hill and the river Poltva was continuously settled since the 9th century. In 1977 it was discovered that the Orthodox church of St. Nicholas had been built on a previously functioning cemetery. The city of Lviv was founded by King Daniel of Galicia (1201—1264) in the Principality of Halych of Kingdom of Rus` and named in honour of his son Lev as Lwihorod which is consistent with name of other Ukrainian cities such as Myrhorod, Sharhorod, Novhorod, Bilhorod, Horodyshche, Horodok and many others.\nLviv was invaded by the Tatars in 1261. Various sources relate the events which range from destruction of the castle through to a complete razing of the town. All the sources agree that it was on the orders of the Mongol general Burundai. The Shevchenko Scientific Society (\"Naukove tovarystvo im. Shevchenka\") informs that the order to raze the city was reduced by Burundai. The Galician-Volhynian chronicle states that in 1261 \"Said Buronda to Vasylko: 'Since you are at peace with me then raze all your castles'\". Basil Dmytryshyn states that the order was implied to be the fortifications as a whole \"If you wish to have peace with me, then destroy [all fortifications of] your towns\". According to the \"Universal-Lexicon der Gegenwart und Vergangenheit\" the town's founder was ordered to destroy the town himself.\n\nAfter King Daniel's death, King Lev rebuilt the town around the year 1270 at its present location, choosing Lviv as his residence, and made Lviv the capital of Galicia-Volhynia. The city is first mentioned in the Halych-Volhynian Chronicle regarding the events that were dated 1256. The town grew quickly due to an influx of Polish people from Kraków, Poland, after they had suffered a widespread famine there. Around 1280 Armenians lived in Galicia and were mainly based in Lviv where they had their own Archbishop. In the 13th and early 14th centuries, Lviv was largely a wooden city, except for its several stone churches. Some of them, like the Church of Saint Nicholas, have survived to this day, although in a thoroughly rebuilt form. The town was inherited by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1340 and ruled by voivode Dmytro Dedko, the favourite of the Lithuanian prince Lubart, until 1349.\n\nDuring the wars over the succession of Galicia-Volhynia Principality in 1339 King Casimir III of Poland undertook an expedition and conquered Lviv in 1340, burning down the old princely castle. Poland ultimately gained control over Lviv and the adjacent region in 1349. From then on the population was subjected to attempts to both Polonize and Catholicize the population. The Lithuanians ravaged Lviv land in 1351 during the Halych-Volhyn Wars with Lviv being plundered and destroyed by prince Liubartas in 1353. Casimir built a new city center (or founded a new town) in a basin, surrounded it by walls, and replaced the wooden palace by masonry castle – one of the two built by him. The old (Ruthenian) settlement, after it had been rebuilt, became known as the Krakovian Suburb.\n\nIn 1356 Casimir brought in more Germans and within seven years granted the Magdeburg rights which implied that all city matters were to be resolved by a council elected by the wealthy citizens. The city council seal of the 14th century stated: S(igillum): \"Civitatis Lembvrgensis\". In 1358 the city became a seat of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv, which initiated spread of Latin Church onto the Ruthenian lands.\n\nAfter Casimir had died in 1370, he was succeeded as king of Poland by his nephew, King Louis I of Hungary, who in 1372 put Lviv together with the region of Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia under the administration of his relative Vladislaus II of Opole, Duke of Opole. When in 1387 Władysław retreated from the post of its governor, Galicia-Volhynia became occupied by the Hungarians, but soon Jadwiga, the youngest daughter of Louis, but also ruler of Poland and wife of King of Poland Władysław II Jagiełło, unified it directly with the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland.\n\nIn 1349, the Kingdom of Ruthenia with its capital Lviv was annexed by the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The kingdom was transformed into the Ruthenian domain of the Crown with capital in Lwów. On 17 June 1356 King Casimir III the Great granted it Magdeburg rights. In 1362, the High Castle was completely rebuilt with stone replacing the previous made out of wood. The city's prosperity during the following centuries is owed to the trade privileges granted to it by Casimir, Queen Jadwiga and the subsequent Polish monarchs. Germans, Poles and Czechs formed the largest groups of newcomers. Most of the settlers were polonised by the end of the 15th century, and the city became a Polish island surrounded by Orthodox Ruthenian population.\nIn 1412, the local archdiocese has developed into the Roman Catholic Metropolis, which since 1375 as diocese had been in Halych. The new metropolis included regional diocese in Lwow, Przemysl, Chelm, Wlodzimierz, Luck, Kamieniec, as well as Siret and Kijow (see Old Cathedral of St. Sophia, Kiev). First Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lwów was Jan Rzeszowski. \n\nIn 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the Ruthenian Voivodeship. In 1444, the city was granted the staple right, which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of major trading centres on the merchant routes between Central Europe and Black Sea region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom, and was a royal city, like Kraków or Gdańsk. During the 17th century, Lwów was the second largest city of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, with the population of about 30,000.\n\nIn 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, Ivan Fedorov, a graduate of the University of Kraków, settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for Eastern Orthodoxy with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in Church Slavonic in 1580. A Jesuit Collegium was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King John II Casimir of Poland issued a decree granting it \"the honour of the academy and the title of the university\".\n\nThe 17th century brought invading armies of Swedes, Hungarians, Turks, Russians and Cossacks to its gates. In 1648 an army of Cossacks and Crimean Tatars besieged the town. They captured the High Castle, murdering its defenders, but the city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution Bohdan Khmelnytsky accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards Zamość. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called \"Deluge\": the other one was Gdańsk (Danzig). At that time, Lwów witnessed a historic scene, as here King John II Casimir made his famous Lwów Oath. Two years later, John Casimir, in honour of bravery of its residents, declared Lwów to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Kraków and Wilno. In the same year, 1658, Pope Alexander VII declared the city to be Semper fidelis, in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman-Catholicism from Muslim invasion.\n\nIn 1672 it was surrounded by the Ottomans who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the Battle of Lwów (1675) took place near the city. Lwów was captured for the first time since Middle Ages by a foreign army in 1704 when Swedish troops under King Charles XII entered the city after a short siege. The plague of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city's population).\n\nIn 1772, following the First Partition of Poland, the region was annexed by the Habsburg Monarchy to the Austrian Partition. Known in German as \"Lemberg\", the city became the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Lemberg grew dramatically during 19th century, increasing in population from approximately 30,000 at the time of the Austrian annexation in 1772, to 196,000 by 1910 and to 212,000 three years later; while the poverty in Austrian Galicia was raging. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries a large influx of Austrians and German-speaking Czech bureaucrats gave the city a character that by the 1840s were quite Austrian, in its orderliness and in the appearance and popularity of Austrian coffeehouses.\n\nIn 1773, the first newspaper in Lemberg, \"Gazette de Leopoli\", began to be published. In 1784, a latin language university was opened with lectures in German, Polish and even Ruthenian; after closing again in 1805, it was reopened in 1817. By 1825 German became the sole language of instruction.\nDuring the 19th century, the Austrian administration attempted to Germanise the city's educational and governmental institutions. Many cultural organisations which did not have a pro-German orientation were closed. After the revolutions of 1848, the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain sociolect developed in the city known as the Lwów dialect. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, it was the first European city to have street lights due to innovations discovered by Lviv inhabitants Ignacy Łukasiewicz and Jan Zeh. In that year kerosene lamps were introduced as street lights. Then in 1858, these were updated to gas lamps, and in 1900 to electric ones.\n\nAfter the so-called \"Ausgleich\" of February 1867, the Austrian Empire was reformed into a dualist Austria-Hungary and a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. From 1873, Galicia was 'de facto' an autonomous province of Austria-Hungary with Polish and Ruthenian, as official languages. Germanisation was halted and the censorship lifted as well. Galicia was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the Galician Sejm and provincial administration, both established in Lviv, had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. The city started to grow rapidly, becoming the 4th largest in Austria-Hungary, according to the census of 1910. Many \"Belle Époque\" public edifices and tenement houses were erected, the buildings from the Austrian period, such as the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet built in the Viennese neo-Renaissance style, still dominate and characterise much of the centre of the city.\nDuring Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city's population were Roman Catholics, 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Linguistically, 86% of the city's population used the Polish language and 11% preferred the Ruthenian. At that time, Lviv was home to a number of renowned Polish-language institutions, such as Ossolineum, with the second largest collection of Polish books in the world, Polish Academy of Arts, National Museum (since 1908), Historical Museum of the City of Lwów (since 1891), Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists, Polish Historical Society, Lwów University, with Polish as official language since 1882, Lwów Scientific Society, Lwów Art Gallery, Polish Theatre, Polish Archdiocese.\n\nFurthermore, Lviv was the centre of a number of Polish independence organisations. In June 1908, Józef Piłsudski, Władysław Sikorski and Kazimierz Sosnkowski founded here the Union of Active Struggle. Two years later, the paramilitary organisation, called Riflemen's Association, was also founded in the city by Polish activists.\n\nAt the same time, Lviv became the city where famous Ukrainian writers (such as Ivan Franko, Panteleimon Kulish and Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky) published their work. It was a centre of Ukrainian cultural revival. The city also housed the largest and most influential Ukrainian institutions in the world, including the Prosvita society dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language, the Shevchenko Scientific Society, the Dniester Insurance Company and base of the Ukrainian cooperative movement, and it served as the seat of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. Lviv was also a major centre of Jewish culture, in particular as a centre of the Yiddish language, and was the home of the world's first Yiddish-language daily newspaper, the \"Lemberger Togblat\", established in 1904.\n\nIn the Battle of Galicia at the early stages of the First World War, Lviv was captured by the Russian army in September 1914 following the Battle of Gnila Lipa. The Lemberg Fortress fell on 3 September. The historian Pál Kelemen provided a first-hand account of the chaotic evacuation of the city by the Austro-Hungarian Army and civilians alike. The town was retaken by Austria–Hungary in June the following year. Lviv and its population, therefore, suffered greatly during the First World War as many of the offensives were fought across its local geography causing significant collateral damage and disruption.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the First World War Lviv became an arena of battle between the local Polish population and the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen. Both nations perceived the city as an integral part of their new statehoods which at that time were forming in the former Austrian territories. On the night of 31 October–1 November 1918 the Western Ukrainian National Republic was proclaimed with Lviv as its capital. 2,300 Ukrainian soldiers from the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (Sichovi Striltsi), which had previously been a corps in the Austrian Army, took control over Lviv. The city's Polish majority opposed the Ukrainian declaration and began to fight against the Ukrainian troops. During this combat an important role was taken by young Polish city defenders called Lwów Eaglets.\n\nThe Ukrainian forces withdrew outside Lwów's confines by 21 November 1918, after which elements of Polish soldiers began to loot and burn much of the Jewish and Ukrainian quarters of the city, killing approximately 340 civilians (see: Lwów pogrom). The retreating Ukrainian forces besieged the city. The Sich riflemen reformed into the Ukrainian Galician Army (UHA). The Polish forces aided from central Poland, including General Haller's \"Blue Army\", equipped by the French, relieved the besieged city in May 1919 forcing the UHA to the east.\n\nDespite Entente mediation attempts to cease hostilities and reach a compromise between belligerents the Polish–Ukrainian War continued until July 1919 when the last UHA forces withdrew east of the River Zbruch. The border on the River Zbruch was confirmed at the Treaty of Warsaw, when in April 1920 Field Marshal Pilsudski signed an agreement with Symon Petlura where it was agreed that for military support against the Bolsheviks the Ukrainian People's Republic renounced its claims to the territories of Eastern Galicia.\n\nIn August 1920 Lviv was attacked by the Red Army under the command of Aleksandr Yegorov and Stalin during the Polish–Soviet War but the city repelled the attack. For the courage of its inhabitants Lviv was awarded the Virtuti Militari cross by Józef Piłsudski on 22 November 1920. \n\nOn 23 February 1921, the council of the League of Nations declared that Galicia (including the city) lay outside the territory of Poland and that Poland did not have the mandate to establish administrative control in that country, and that Poland was merely the occupying military power of Galicia (as a whole), whose sovereign remained the Allied Powers and fate would be determined by the Council of Ambassadors at the League of Nations. On 14 March 1923, the Council of Ambassadors decided that Galicia would be incorporated into Poland \"whereas it is recognised by Poland that ethnographical conditions necessitate an autonomous regime in the Eastern part of Galicia.\" \"This proviso was never honored by the interwar Polish government.\" After 1923, Galicia was internationally recognized as part of the Polish state.\n\nDuring the interwar period, Lwów held the rank of the Second Polish Republic's third most populous city (following Warsaw and Łódź), and it became the seat of the Lwów Voivodeship. Following Warsaw, Lwów was the second most important cultural and academic centre of interwar Poland. For example, in 1920 professor Rudolf Weigl of the Lwów University developed a vaccine against typhus fever. Furthermore, the geographic location of Lwów gave it an important role in stimulating international trade and fostering the city's and Poland's economic development. A major trade fair called \"Targi Wschodnie\" was established in 1921. In the academic year 1937–1938, there were 9,100 students attending five institutions of higher education, including the Lwów University as well as the Polytechnic.\n\nWhile about two-thirds of the city's inhabitants were Poles, some of whom speak the characteristic Lwów dialect, the eastern part of the Lwów Voivodeship had a relative Ukrainian majority in most of its rural areas. Although Polish authorities obliged themselves internationally to provide Eastern Galicia with an autonomy (including a creation of a separate Ukrainian university in Lwów) and even though in September 1922 adequate Polish Sejm's Bill was enacted, it was not fulfilled. The Polish government discontinued many Ukrainian schools which functioned during the Austrian rule, and closed down Ukrainian departments at the University of Lwów with the exception of one. Prewar Lwów also had a large and thriving Jewish community, which constituted about a quarter of the population.\n\nUnlike in Austrian times, when the size and amount of public parades or other cultural expressions corresponded to each cultural group's relative population, the Polish government emphasised the Polish nature of the city and limited public displays of Jewish and Ukrainian culture. Military parades and commemorations of battles at particular streets within the city, all celebrating the Polish forces who fought against the Ukrainians in 1918, became frequent, and in the 1930s a vast memorial monument and burial ground of Polish soldiers from that conflict was built in the city's Lychakiv Cemetery.\n\nGermany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 and by 14 September Lviv was completely encircled by German units. Subsequently, the Soviets invaded Poland on 17 September. On 22 September 1939 Lwów capitulated to the Red Army. The USSR annexed the eastern half of the Second Polish Republic with Ukrainian and Belorussian population. The city became the capital of the newly formed Lviv Oblast. The Soviets reopened uni-lingual Ukrainian schools, which were discontinued by the Polish government. The only change over imposed by the Soviets was the language of instruction, with the actual net loss of about 1,000 schools in short order. Ukrainian was made compulsory in the University of Lviv with almost all its books in Polish. It became thoroughly Ukrainized and renamed after Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko. The Polish academics were laid off. \"Soviet rule – wrote Tarik Cyril Amar (\"The Paradox of Ukrainian Lviv\") – turned out to be much more oppressive than Polish rule. The rich world of Ukrainian publications in Polish Lwów, for instance, was gone in Soviet Ukrainian Lviv, and with it, many journalism jobs.\n\nOn 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany and several of its allies invaded the USSR. In the initial stage of Operation Barbarossa (30 June 1941) Lviv was taken by the Germans. The evacuating Soviets killed most of the prison population, with arriving Wehrmacht forces easily discovering evidence of the Soviet mass murders in the city committed by the NKVD and NKGB. Ukrainian nationalists, organised as a militia, and the civilian population were allowed to take revenge on the \"Jews and the Bolsheviks\" and indulged in several mass killings in Lviv and the surrounding region, which resulted in the deaths estimated at between 4,000 and 10,000 Jews. On 30 June 1941 Yaroslav Stetsko proclaimed in Lviv the Government of an independent Ukrainian state allied with Nazi Germany. This was done without preapproval from the Germans and after 15 September 1941 the organisers were arrested.\n\nThe Sikorski–Mayski Agreement signed in London on 30 July 1941 between Polish government-in-exile and USSR's government invalidated the September 1939 Soviet-German partition of Poland, as the Soviets declared it null and void. Meanwhile, German-occupied Eastern Galicia at the beginning of August 1941 was incorporated into the General Government as \"Distrikt Galizien\" with Lviv as district's capital. German policy towards the Polish population in this area was as harsh as in the rest of the General Government. Germans during the occupation of the city committed numerous atrocities including the killing of Polish university professors in 1941. German Nazis viewed the Ukrainian Galicians, former inhabitants of Austrian Crown Land, as to some point more aryanised and civilised than the Ukrainian population living in the territories belonging to the USSR before 1939. As a result, they escaped the full extent of German acts in comparison to Ukrainians who lived to the east, in the German-occupied Soviet Ukraine turned into the \"Reichskommissariat Ukraine\".\n\nAccording to the Third Reich's racial policies, local Jews then became the main target of German repressions in the region. Following German occupation, the Jewish population was concentrated in the Lwów Ghetto established in the city's Zamarstynów (today \"Zamarstyniv\") district, and the Janowska concentration camp was also set up. In 1931 there were 75,316 Yiddish-speaking inhabitants, but by 1941 approximately 100,000 Jews were present in Lviv. The majority of these Jews were either killed within the city or deported to Belzec extermination camp. In the summer of 1943, on the orders of Heinrich Himmler, SS-Standartenführer Paul Blobel was tasked with the destruction of any evidence of Nazi mass murders in the Lviv area. On 15 June Blobel, using forced labourers from Janowska, dug up a number of mass graves and incinerated the remains. Later, on 19 November 1943, inmates at Janowska staged an uprising and attempted a mass escape. A few succeeded, but most were recaptured and killed. The SS staff and their local auxiliaries then, at the time of the Janowska camp's liquidation, murdered at least 6,000 more inmates, as well as the Jews in other forced labour camps in Galicia. By the end of the war, the Jewish population of the city was virtually eliminated, with only around 200 to 800 survivors remaining.\n\nAfter the successful Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive of July 1944, the Soviet 3rd Guards Tank Army captured Lviv on 27 July 1944, with a significant cooperation from the local Polish resistance (see: Lwów Uprising). Soon thereafter, the local commanders of Polish \"Armia Krajowa\" were invited to a meeting with the commanders of the Red Army. During the meeting, they were arrested, as it turned out to be a trap set by the Soviet NKVD. Later, in the winter and spring of 1945, the local NKVD kept arresting and harassing Poles in Lviv (which according to Soviet sources on 1 October 1944 still had a clear Polish majority of 66.7%) in an attempt to encourage their emigration from the city. Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were to be shifted westwards in accordance with the Yalta conference settlements. In Yalta, despite Polish objections, the Allied leaders, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill decided that Lviv should remain within the borders of the Soviet Union. On 16 August 1945, a border agreement was signed in Moscow between the government of the Soviet Union and the Provisional Government of National Unity installed by the Soviets in Poland. In the treaty, Polish authorities formally ceded prewar eastern part of the country to the Soviet Union, agreeing to the Polish-Soviet border to be drawn according to the so-called \"Curzon Line\". Consequently, the agreement was ratified on 5 February 1946.\n\nIn February 1946, Lviv became a part of the Soviet Union. It is estimated that from 100,000 to 140,000 Poles were resettled from the city into the so-called Recovered Territories as a part of postwar population transfers, many of them to the area of newly acquired Wrocław, formerly the German city of Breslau. Little remains of Polish culture in Lviv. But Polish history and heritage is still visible. Many buildings in the old part of the city are great examples of Polish architecture, which flourished in Lviv after opening Technical School (later Polytechnic), the first higher education technical academy on Polish lands. Polytechnic educated generations of architects which were influential in the entire country. In Lviv the best examples of their work are: the main buildings of Lviv Polytechnic, University of Lviv, Lviv Opera, Lviv railway station, former building of Galicyjska Kasa Oszczędności, Potocki Palace. During interwar period Lviv was striving to become a modern metropolis, so architects were experimenting with modernism. It was the period of the most rapid growth of the city, so one can find many examples of architecture from this time in the city. Great examples are main building of Lviv Academy of Commerce, the second Sprecher's building or building of City Electrical Facilities. The most visible monument of the Polish past is the Adam Mickiewicz Monument at the square of his name. Many Polish pieces of arts, sculptures and paintings can be found in Lviv galleries, among them works of Jan Piotr Norblin, Marceleo Bacciarelli, Kazimierz Wojniakowski, Antoni Brodowski, Henryk Rodakowski, Artur Grottger, Jan Matejko, Aleksander Gierymski, Jan Stanisławski, Leon Wyczółkowski, Józef Chełmoński, Józef Mehoffer, Stanisław Wyspiański, Olga Boznańska, Władysław Słowiński, Jacek Malczewski. The Polish history of Lviv is still well remembered in Poland and those Poles who stayed in Lviv have formed their own organisation the Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land.\n\nAccording to various estimates, Lviv lost between 80% and 90% of its pre-war population. Expulsion of the Polish population and the Holocaust together with migration from Ukrainian-speaking surrounding areas (including forcibly resettled from the territories which, after the war, became part of the Polish People's Republic), from other parts of the Soviet Union, altered the ethnic composition of the city. Immigration from Russia and Russian-speaking regions of Eastern Ukraine was encouraged. The prevalence of the Ukrainian-speaking population has led to the fact that under the conditions of Soviet Russification, Lviv became the main a major centre of dissident movement in Ukraine and played a key role in Ukraine's independence in 1991.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the city significantly expanded both in population and size mostly due to the city's rapidly growing industrial base. Due to the fight of SMERSH with the guerrilla formations of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army the city obtained a nickname with a negative connotation of \"Banderstadt\" as the City of Stepan Bandera. The German suffix for city \"stadt\" was added instead of the Russian \"grad\" to imply alienation. Over the years the residents of the city found this so ridiculous that even people not familiar with Bandera accepted it as a sarcasm in reference to the Soviet perception of western Ukraine. In the period of liberalisation from the Soviet system in the 1980s, the city became the centre of political movements advocating Ukrainian independence from the USSR. By the time of the fall of the Soviet Union the name became a proud mark for the Lviv natives culminating in the creation of a local rock band under the name \"Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu\" (Boys from Banderstadt).\n\nCitizens of Lviv strongly supported Viktor Yushchenko during the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election and played a key role in the Orange Revolution. Hundreds of thousands of people would gather in freezing temperatures to demonstrate for the Orange camp. Acts of civil disobedience forced the head of the local police to resign and the local assembly issued a resolution refusing to accept the fraudulent first official results. Lviv remains today one of the main centres of Ukrainian culture and the origin of much of the nation's political class.\n\nIn support of the Euromaidan movement, Lviv's executive committee declared itself independent of the rule of President Viktor Yanukovych on 19 February 2014.\n\nLviv is divided into six raions (districts), each with its own administrative bodies:\n\n\nNotable suburbs include Vynnyky (), Briukhovychi (), and Rudne ().\n\nLviv residents live 75 years on average, and this age is 7 years longer than the average age in Ukraine and 8 years more than the world average (68 years). In 2010 the average life expectancy was 71 among men and 79.5 years among women. The fertility rates have been steadily increasing between 2001 and 2010; however, the effects of low fertility in the previous years remained noticeable even though the birth rates grew. There is an acute shortage of young people under the age of 25. In 2011, 13.7% of Lviv's population consisted of young people under 15 years and 17.6% of persons aged 60 years and over.\n\n\nEthnic Poles and the Polish Jews began to settle in Lwów in considerable numbers already in 1349 after the city was conquered by King Casimir of the Piast dynasty. Lwów served as Poland's major cultural and economic centre for several centuries, during the Polish Golden Age, and until the partitions of Poland perpetrated by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. In reborn Poland, the Lwów Voivodeship (inhabited by 2,789,000 people in 1921) grew to 3,126,300 inhabitants in mere ten years.\n\nAs a result of World War II, Lviv was depolonised, mainly through Soviet-arranged population exchange in 1944–1946 but also by early deportations to Siberia. Those who remained on their own volition after the border shift became a small ethnic minority in Lviv. By 1959 Poles made up only 4% of the local population. Many families were mixed. During the Soviet decades only two Polish schools continued to function: № 10 (with 8 grades) and № 24 (with 10 grades).\n\nIn the 1980s the process of uniting groups into ethnic associations was allowed. In 1988 a Polish-language newspaper was permitted (\"Gazeta Lwowska\"). The Polish population of the city continues to use the dialect of the Polish language known as \"Lwów dialect\" ().\n\nThe first known Jews in Lviv date back to the 10th century. The oldest remaining Jewish tombstone dates back to 1348. Apart from the Rabbanite Jews there were many Karaites who had settled in the city after coming from the East and from Byzantium. After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate Jewish quarters, one within the city walls and one outside on the outskirts of the city. Each had its separate synagogue, although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the Crimean Karaite community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.\n\nBefore the Holocaust about one-third of the city's population was made up of Jews (more than 140,000 on the eve of World War II). This number swelled to about 240,000 by the end of 1940 as tens of thousands of Jews fled from the Nazi-occupied parts of Poland into the relative (and temporary) sanctuary of Soviet-occupied Poland (including Lviv) following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact that divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet zones in 1939. Almost all these Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, the Nazis also destroyed the Jewish cemetery, which was subsequently \"paved over by the Soviets\".\n\nAfter the war, a new Jewish population was formed from among the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians that migrated to the city. The post-war Jewish population peaked at 30,000 in the 1970s. Currently, the Jewish population has shrunk considerably as a result of emigration (mainly to Israel and the United States) and, to a lesser degree, assimilation, and is estimated at 1,100. A number of organisations continue to be active.\n\nThe Sholem Aleichem Jewish Culture Society in Lviv initiated the construction of a monument to the victims of the ghetto in 1988. On 23 August 1992, the memorial complex to the victims of the Lwów ghetto (1941–1943) was officially opened. During 2011–2012, some anti-Semitic acts against the memorial took place. On 20 March 2011, it was reported that the slogan \"death to the Jews\" with a Swastika was sprayed on the monument. On 21 March 2012, the memorial was vandalized by unknown individuals, in what seemed to be an anti-Semitic act.\n\nLviv is the most important business centre of Western Ukraine . As of 1 January 2011 until the economy the city has invested 837.1 million US dollars , accounting for almost two-thirds of the total investments in the Lviv region . In 2015, the company of Lviv was involved $ 14.3 million. U.S. foreign direct investment, which, however, is two times less than a year earlier ($ 30.9 million in 2014). During January-September 2017 the general amount of direct foreign investment received by the local government in Lviv is $ 52.4 million. U.S. According to the statistics administration, foreign capital was invested by 31 countries (here are some of the main investors: Poland – 47,7%; Australia - 11,3%; Cyprus — 10,7% and the Netherlands — 6%)..\n\nThe total revenue of the city budget of Lviv for 2015 is set at about UAH 3.81 billion, which is 23% more than a year earlier (UAH 2.91 billion in 2014). As of 10 November 2017, the deputies of the Lviv City Council approved a budget in amount of UAH 5.4 billion. The large part of which (UAH 5.12 billion) was the revenue of the fund of the Lviv..\n\nThe average wage in Lviv in 2015 in the business sector amounted to 7,041 UAH, in the budget sphere - 4,175 UAH. On 1 February 2014, registered unemployment was 0.6%.Lviv is one of the largest cities in Ukraine and is growing rapidly. According to the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine the monthly average salary in the Lviv is a little less than the average for Ukraine which in February 2013 was 2765 UAH ($345). According to the World Bank classification Lviv is a middle-income city. In September 2017, the average wage was amounted to 6,784 UAH, which is in 41,0% more than in a previous year..\n\nLviv has 218 large industrial enterprises, more than 40 commercial banks, 4 exchanges, 13 investment companies, 80 insurance and 24 leasing companies, 77 audit firms and almost 9,000 small ventures. For many years machinery-building and electronics were leading industries in Lviv. The city-based public company Electron, trademark of national TV sets manufacturing, produces the 32 and 37 inches liquid-crystal TV-sets. The «Electrontrans» specializes in design and production of modern electric transport including trams, trolleybuses, electric buses, and spare parts. In 2013 Elektrotrans JV started producing low-floor trams, the first Ukrainian 100% low-floor tramways. LAZ is a bus manufacturing company in Lviv with its own rich history. Founded in 1945, LAZ started bus production in the early 1950s. Innovative design ideas of Lviv engineers have become the world standard in bus manufacturing.\n\nThe total volume of industrial production sold in 2015 amounted to UAH 24.2 billion, which is 39% more than a year earlier (UAH 14.6 billion in 2014).\n\nThere are several banks based in Lviv, such as Kredobank, Idea Bank, VS Bank, Oksi Bank and Lviv Bank. None of these banks have bankrupted during the political and economic crisis of 2014-2016. It can be explained by the presence of the foreign capital in most of them. \n\nLviv is a major business center between Warsaw and Kiev. According to the Lviv Economic Development Strategy, the main branches of the city's economy till 2025 should become tourism and information technologies (IT), the business services and logistics are also a priority. In addition, The Nestlé service center has located in Lviv. This center guides the company's divisions in 20 countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Also during 2016 the Global Service Center VimpelCom in Lviv was launched, which serves finance, procurement and HR operations in eight foreign branches of this company. \n\nLviv is also one of the leaders of software export in Eastern Europe with expected sector growth of 20% by 2020. Over 25% of all IT specialists in Ukraine work in Lviv, with over 1500 new IT graduates coming from local universities each year. In 2009, [KPMG], one of the famous international auditing companies, included Lviv in top 30 cities with the greatest potential of information technology development. As of December 2015, there were 192 IT-companies operating in the city, of which 4 large (with more than 400 employees), 16 average (150-300 employees), 97 small (10-110 employees) and 70 micro companies (3-7 employees). The turnover of the Lviv's IT industry in 2015 amounted to $ 300 million U.S. About 50% of IT services are exported to the US, 37% to Europe, and the rest - to other countries. As of 2015, about 15 thousand specialists were employed in this industry with the average salary of 28 thousand UAH. According to a study of the Economic Effect of the Lviv IT-Market, which was conducted by Lviv IT Cluster and sociological agency \"The Farm\", there are 257 IT companies operating in Lviv in 2017, that employing about 17 thousand specialists. The economic impact of the IT industry in Lviv is $ 734 million U.S.. \n\nThere are many restaurants and shops as well as street vendors of food, books, clothes, traditional cultural items and tourist gifts. Banking and money trading are an important part of the economy of Lviv with many banks and exchange offices throughout the city.\n\nLviv Airlines has its head office on the grounds of Lviv Airport, but no longer operates any flights.\n\nLviv is one of the most important cultural centres of Ukraine. The city is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre. Nowadays, the indisputable evidence of the city cultural richness is a big number of theatres, concert halls, creative unions, and also the high number of many artistic activities (more than 100 festivals annually, 60 museums, 10 theatres).\n\nLviv's historic centre has been on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage list since 1998. UNESCO gave the following reasons for its selection:\n\nLviv's historic churches, buildings and relics date from the 13th century – 18th century (Polish rule). In recent centuries it was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other Ukrainian cities. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. \nAfter the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its gothic-style buildings but it retains many buildings in renaissance, baroque and the classic styles. There are works by artists of the Vienna Secession, Art Nouveau and Art Deco.\n\nThe buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the Lychakivskiy Cemetery where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the architectural style changes radically as Soviet-era high-rise blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the Soviet era is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.\n\nOutdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex history of Lviv. There are monuments to Adam Mickiewicz, Ivan Franko, King Danylo, Taras Shevchenko, Ivan Fedorov, Solomiya Krushelnytska, Ivan Pidkova, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, Pope John Paul II, Jan Kiliński, Ivan Trush, Saint George, Bartosz Głowacki, the monument to the Virgin Mary, to Nikifor, The Good Soldier Švejk, Stepan Bandera, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, and many others.\n\nDuring the interwar period there were monuments commemorating important figures of the history of Poland. Some of them were moved to the Polish \"Recovered Territories\" after World War II, like the monument to Aleksander Fredro which now is in Wrocław, the monument of King John III Sobieski which after 1945 was moved to Gdańsk, and the monument of Kornel Ujejski which is now in Szczecin. A book market takes place around the monument to Ivan Fеdorovych, a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.\n\nNew ideas came to Lviv during the Austro–Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many publishing houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the Ossolineum which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local Jesuit church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the Ukrainian government to return these documents to Poland. Subsequently, in 2003 Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006 an office of the Ossolineum (which now is located in Wrocław) was opened in Lviv and began a process to scan all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, Ukrainian, Yiddish, and Polish literature, with a multitude of translations.\n\nLviv is a city of religious variety. Religion (2012): Catholic: 57% (Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church 56% and Roman Catholic Church 1%) Orthodox: 32%, Protestantism: 2% Judaism : 0.1% Other religion: 3% Indifferent to religious matters: 4% Atheism: 1.9%\n\nAt one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. The largest Christian Churches have existed in the city since the 13th century. There are three major Christian groups: The Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv, the Roman Catholics, and the Armenian Church. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the Orthodox community in Ukraine transferred their allegiance to the Pope in Rome and became the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival.\n\nLviv is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv, the centre of the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine and until 21 August 2005 was the centre of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, 9 per cent to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kiev Patriarchate and 6 per cent to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nUntil 2005, Lviv was the only city with two Catholic Cardinals: Lubomyr Husar (Byzantine Rite) and Marian Jaworski (Latin Rite).\n\nIn June 2001, Pope John Paul II visited the Latin Cathedral, St. George's Cathedral and the Armenian Cathedral.\n\nLviv historically had a large and active Jewish community and until 1941 at least 45 synagogues and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the Krakowskie Przedmieście. The Golden Rose Synagogue was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more cultural assimilation and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, Orthodox and Hasidic Jews tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered.\n\nUnder the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. Only since the fall of the Iron Curtain, has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.\n\nCurrently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue.\n\nThe range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, Johann Georg Pinzel, whose works can be seen on the façade of the St. George's Cathedral in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of Solomiya Krushelnytska, who began her career as a singer of Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of La Scala Opera in Milan.\n\nThe \"Group Artes\" was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: Futurism, Cubism, New Objectivity and Surrealism. Co–operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by \"Artes\" took place in Warsaw, Kraków, Łódz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943. Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the Holocaust (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900–1980) and Roman Sielski (1903–1990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as Aleksander Fredro, Gabriela Zapolska, Leopold Staff, Maria Konopnicka and Jan Kasprowicz living in Lviv.\n\nToday Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries (The \"Dzyga\" Gallery, Аrt-Gallery \"Primus\", Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art \"Zelena Kanapa\" and others). Lviv National Art Gallery is the largest museum of arts in Ukraine, with approximately 50,000 artworks, including paintings, sculptures and works of graphic art of Western and Eastern Europe, from the Middle Ages to modern days.\n\nIn 1842 the Skarbek Theatre was opened making it the third largest theatre in Central Europe. In 1903 the Lviv National Opera house, which at that time was called the City-Theatre, was opened emulating the Vienna State Opera house. The house initially offered a changing repertoire such as classical dramas in German and Polish language, opera, operetta, comedy and theatre.\nThe opera house is named after the Ukrainian opera diva Salomea Krushelnytska who worked here.\n\nNowadays Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet has a large creative group of performers who strive to maintain traditions of Ukrainian opera and classical ballet. The Theatre is a well-organized creative body where over 500 people work towards a common goal. The repertoire includes 10 Ukrainian music compositions. It should be emphasised that no other similar theatre in Ukraine has such a large number of Ukrainian productions. There are also many operas written by foreign composers, and most of these operas are performed in the original language: \"Othello\", \"Aida\", \"La Traviata\", \"Nabucco\", and \"A Masked Ball\" by G. Verdi, \"Tosca\", \"La Bohème\" and \"Madame Butterfly\" by G. Puccini, \"Cavalleria Rusticana\" by P. Mascagni, and \"Pagliacci\" by R. Leoncavallo (in Italian); \"Carmen\" by G. Bizet (in French), \"The Haunted Manor\" by S. Moniuszko (in Polish)\n\nMuseum Pharmacy \"Pid Chornym Orlom\" (Beneath the Black Eagle) was founded in 1735; it is the oldest pharmacy in Lviv. A museum related to pharmaceutical history was opened on the premises of the old pharmacy in 1966. The idea of creating such a museum had already come up in the 19th century. The Galician Association of Pharmacists was created in 1868; members managed to assemble a small collection of exhibits, thus making the first step towards creating a new museum. Nowadays, the exhibition has expanded considerably, with 16 exhibit rooms and a general exhibition surface totalling 700 sq. m. There are more than 3,000 exhibits in the museum. This is the only operating Museum Pharmacy in Ukraine and Europe.\nThe most notable of the museums are Lviv National Museum which houses the National Gallery. Its collection includes more than 140,000 unique items. The museum takes special pride in presenting the largest and most complete collection of medieval sacral art of the 12th to 18th centuries: icons, manuscripts, rare ancient books, decoratively carved pieces of art, metal and plastic artworks, and fabrics embroidered with gold and silver. The museum also boasts a unique monument of Ukrainian Baroque style: the Bohorodchansky Iconostasis. Exhibits include: Ancient Ukrainian art from the 12th to 15th centuries; Ukrainian art from the 16th to 18th centuries; and Ukrainian art from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 20th centuries.\n\nLviv has an active musical and cultural life. Apart from the Lviv Opera, it has symphony orchestras, chamber orchestras and the Trembita Chorus. Lviv has one of the most prominent music academies and music colleges in Ukraine, the Lviv Conservatory, and also has a factory for the manufacture of stringed musical instruments. Lviv has been the home of numerous composers such as Mozart's son Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart, Stanislav Liudkevych, Wojciech Kilar and Mykola Kolessa.\n\nFlute virtuoso and composer Albert Franz Doppler (1821–1883) was born and spent his formative years here, including flute lessons from his father. The classical pianist Mieczysław Horszowski (1892–1993) was born here. The opera diva Salomea Kruszelnicka called Lviv her home in the 1920s to 1930s. The classical violinist Adam Han Gorski was born here in 1940. \"\"Polish Radio Lwów\" was a Polish radio station that went on-air on 15 January 1930. The programme proved very popular in Poland. Classical music and entertainment was aired as well as lectures, readings, youth-programmes, news and liturgical services on Sunday.\n\nPopular throughout Poland was the Comic Lwów Wave a cabaret-revue with musical pieces. Jewish artists contributed a great part to this artistic activity. Composers such as Henryk Wars, songwriters Emanuel Szlechter and Wiktor Budzyński, the actor Mieczysław Monderer and Adolf Fleischer (\"Aprikosenkranz und Untenbaum\"\") worked in Lviv. The most notable stars of the shows were Henryk Vogelfänger and Kazimierz Wajda who appeared together as the comic duo \"Szczepko and Tońko\" and were similar to Laurel and Hardy.\n\nThe Lviv Philharmonic is a major cultural centre with its long history and traditions that complement the entire culture of Ukraine. Exactly from the stage of Lviv Philharmonic began their way to the great art world-famous Ukrainian musicians – Oleh Krysa, Oleksandr Slobodyanik, Yuriy Lysychenko, Maria Chaikovska, also the musicians of new generation – E. Chupryk, Y. Ermin, Oksana Rapita, Olexandr Kozarenko. Lviv Philharmonic is one of the leading concert institutions in Ukraine, which activities include various forms of promotion of the best examples of the music art – international festivals, cycles of concerts-monographs, concerts with participation of young musicians, etc.\n\nThe Chamber Orchestra \"Lviv virtuosos\" was organised of the best Lviv musicians in 1994. The orchestra consists of 16–40 persons / it depends on programmes/ and in the repertoire are included the musical compositions from Bach, Corelli to modern Ukrainian and European composers. During the short time of its operation, the orchestra acquired the professional level of the best European standards. It is mentioned in more than 100 positive articles of the Ukrainian and foreign musical critics.\n\nLviv is the hometown of the Vocal formation \"Pikkardiyska Tertsiya\" and Eurovision Song Contest 2004 winner Ruslana who has since become well known in Europe and the rest of the world. PikkardiyskaTertsia was created on 24 September 1992 in Lviv, and has won many musical awards. It all began with a quartet performing ancient Ukrainian music from the 15th century, along with adaptations of traditional Ukrainian folk songs.\n\nLviv is also the hometown to one of the most successful and popular Ukrainian rock bands, Okean Elzy.\n\nLviv University is one of the oldest in Central Europe and was founded as a Society of Jesus (Jesuit) school in 1608. Its prestige greatly increased through the work of philosopher Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938) who was one of the founders of the Lwów-Warsaw School of Logic. This school of thought set benchmarks for academic research and education in Poland. The Polish politician of the interbellum period Stanisław Głąbiński had served as dean of the law department (1889–1890) and as the University rector (1908–1909). In 1901 the city was the seat of the Lwów Scientific Society among whose members were major scientific figures. The most well-known were the mathematicians Stefan Banach, Juliusz Schauder and Stanisław Ulam who were founders of the Lwów School of Mathematics turning Lviv in the 1930s into the \"World Centre of Functional Analysis\" and whose share in Lviv academia was substantial.\n\nIn 1852 in Dublany ( from the outskirts of Lviv) the Agricultural Academy was opened and was one of the first Polish agricultural colleges. The Academy was merged with the Lviv Polytechnic in 1919. Another important college of the interbellum period was the Academy of Foreign Trade in Lwów.\n\nIn 1873 in Lviv was founded Shevchenko Scientific Society from the beginning it attracted the financial and intellectual support of writers and patrons of Ukrainian background.\n\nIn 1893 due to the change in its statute, the Shevchenko Scientific Society was transformed into a real scholarly multidisciplinary academy of sciences. Under the presidency of the historian, Mykhailo Hrushevsky, it greatly expanded its activities, contributing to both the humanities and the physical sciences, law and medicine, but most specifically once again it was concentrated onto the Ukrainian studies.\nThe Soviet Union annexed the eastern half of the Second Polish Republic including the city of Lwów which capitulated to the Red Army on 22 September 1939. Upon their occupation of Lviv, the Soviets dissolved the Shevchenko society. Many of its members were arrested and either imprisoned or executed.\n\nLviv was the home of the Scottish Café, where in the 1930s and the early 1940s, Polish mathematicians from the Lwów School of Mathematics met and spent their afternoons discussing mathematical problems. Stanisław Ulam who was later a participant in the Manhattan Project and the proposer of the Teller-Ulam design of thermonuclear weapons, Stefan Banach one of the founders of functional analysis, Hugo Steinhaus, Karol Borsuk, Kazimierz Kuratowski, Mark Kac and many other notable mathematicians would gather there. The café building now houses the Atlas Deluxe Hotel at 27 Taras Shevchenko Prospekt (prewar Polish street name: \"ulica Akademicka\"). Mathematician Zygmunt Janiszewski died in Lviv on 3 January 1920.\nEver since the early 1990s, Lviv has been the spiritual home of the post-independence Ukrainian-language publishing industry.\nLviv Book Forum (International Publishers' Forum) is the biggest book fair in Ukraine. Lviv is the centre of promotion of the Ukrainian Latin alphabet (Latynka).\nThe most popular newspapers in Lviv are \"Vysoky Zamok\", \"Ekspres\", \"Lvivska hazeta\", \"Ratusha\", Subotna poshta\", \"Hazeta po-lvivsky\", \"Postup\" and others. Popular magazines include \"Lviv Today\", \"Chetver\", \"RIA\" and \"Ї\". \"Lviv Today\" is a Ukrainian English-speaking magazine, content includes information about business, advertisement and entertainment spheres in Lviv, and the country in general.\n\nThe Lviv oblast television company transmits on channel 12. There are 3 private television channels operating from Lviv: \"LUKS\", \"NTA\" and \"ZIK\".\n\nThere are 17 regional and all-Ukrainian radio stations operating in the city.\n\nA number of information agencies exist in the city such as \"ZIK\", \"Zaxid.net\", \"Гал-info\", \"Львівський портал\" and others.\n\nLviv is home to one of the oldest Polish-language newspapers \"Gazeta Lwowska\" which was first published in 1811 and still exists in a bi–weekly form.\nAmong other publications were such titles as\nStarting in the 20th century a new movement started with authors from Central Europe. In Lviv a small neo-romantic group of authors formed around the lyricist Schmuel Jankev Imber. Small print offices produced collections of modern poems and short stories and through emigration a large networkwas established. A second smaller group in the 1930s tried to create a connection between avantgarde art and Yiddish culture. Members of this group were Debora Vogel, Rachel Auerbach and Rachel Korn. The Holocaust destroyed this movement with Debora Vogel amongst many other Yiddish authors murdered by the Germans in the 1940s.\n\n\nLviv architectural face is complemented and enriched with numerous parks, and public gardens. There are over 20 basic recreation park zones, 3 botanical gardens and 16 natural monuments. They offer a splendid chance to escape from city life or simply sit for a while among the trees, at a nice fountain or a lake. Each park has its individual character which reflects through various monuments and their individual history.\n\n\nLviv was an important centre for sport in Central Europe and is regarded as the birth–place of Polish football. Lviv is the Polish birthplace of other sports. In January 1905 the first Polish ice-hockey match took place there and two years later the first ski-jumping competition was organised in nearby Sławsko. In the same year, the first Polish basketball games were organised in Lviv's gymnasiums. In autumn 1887 a gymnasium by Lychakiv Street (pol. \"ulica Łyczakowska\") held the first Polish track and field competition with such sports as the long jump and high jump. Lviv's athlete Władysław Ponurski represented Austria in the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm. On 9 July 1922 the first official rugby game in Poland took place at the stadium of Pogoń Lwów in which the rugby team of Orzeł Biały Lwów divided itself into two teams – \"The Reds\" and \"The Blacks\". The referee of this game was a Frenchman by the name of Robineau.\nThe first known official goal in a Polish football match was scored there on 14 July 1894 during the Lwów-Kraków game. The goal was scored by Włodzimierz Chomicki who represented the team of Lviv. In 1904 Kazimierz Hemerling from Lviv published the first translation of the rules of football into Polish and another native of Lviv, Stanisław Polakiewicz, became the first officially recognised Polish referee in 1911 the year in which the first Polish Football Federation was founded in Lviv. The first Polish professional football club, Czarni Lwów opened here in 1903 and the first stadium, which belonged to Pogoń, in 1913. Another club, Pogoń Lwów, was four times football champion of Poland (1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926). In the late 1920s as many as four teams from the city played in the Polish Football League (Pogoń, Czarni, Hasmonea and Lechia). Hasmonea was the first Jewish football club in Poland. Several notable figures of Polish football came from the city including Kazimierz Górski, Ryszard Koncewicz, Michał Matyas and Wacław Kuchar.\n\nIn the period 1900–1911 opened most famous football clubs in Lviv.\nProfessor Ivan Bobersky has based in the Academic grammar school the first Ukrainian sports circle where schoolboys were engaged in track and field athletics, football, boxing, hockey, skiing, tourism and sledge sports in 1906.\nHe has organised the \"Ukrainian Sports circle\" in 1908.\nMuch its pupils in due course in 1911 have formed a sports society with the loud name \"Ukraine\" – first Ukrainian football club of Lviv.\n\nLviv now has several major professional football clubs and some smaller clubs. FC Karpaty Lviv, founded in 1963, plays in the first division of the Ukrainian Premier League. Sometimes citizens of Lviv assemble on the central street (Freedom Avenue) to watch and cheer during outdoor broadcasts of games.\n\nThere are three major stadiums in Lviv. One of them is the Ukraina Stadium which is leased to FC Karpaty Lviv until 2018.\nArena Lviv is a brand-new football stadium that was an official venue for Euro 2012 Championship games in Lviv. Construction work began on 20 November 2008 and was completed by October 2011. The opening ceremony took place on 29 October, with a vast theatrical production dedicated to the history of Lviv. Arena Lviv is currently playing host to Shakhtar Donetsk and Metalurh Donetsk due to the ongoing war in Donbass.\n\nLviv's chess school enjoys a good reputation; such notable grandmasters as Vassily Ivanchuk, Leonid Stein, Alexander Beliavsky, Andrei Volokitin used to live in Lviv.\n\nLviv was originally bidding to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, but has withdrawn and will now most likely bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics.\nDue to a comprehensive cultural programme and tourism infrastructure (having more than 8,000 hotel rooms, over 700 cafes and restaurants, free WI-Fi zones in the city centre, and good connection with many countries of the world), Lviv is considered one of Ukraine's major tourist destinations. The city had a 40% increase in tourist visits in the early 2010s; the highest rate in Europe.\n\nThe most popular tourist attractions include the Old Town, and the Market Square () which is an square in the city centre where the City Hall is situated, as well as the Black House (), Armenian Cathedral, the complex of the Dormition Church which is the main Orthodox church in the city; the St. Peter and Paul Church of the Jesuit Order (one of the largest churches in Lviv); along with the Korniakt Palace, now part of the Lviv History Museum; the Latin Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary; St. George's Cathedral of the Greek-Catholic Church; the Dominican Church of Corpus Christi; Chapel of the Boim family; the Lviv High Castle () on a hill overlooking the centre of the city; the Union of Lublin Mound; the Lychakivskiy Cemetery where the notable people were buried; and the Svobody Prospekt which is Lviv's central street. Other popular places include Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet, the Potocki Palace, and the Bernardine Church.\n\nThe native residents of the city are jokingly known as the Lvivian batiary (someone who's mischievous). Lvivians are also well known for their way of speaking that was greatly influenced by the Lvivian gwara (talk). \n\n\"Wesoła Lwowska Fala\" (Polish for \"Lwów's Merry Wave\") was a weekly radio program of the Polish Radio Lwow with \"Szczepko\" and \"Tonko\", later starring in \"Będzie lepiej\" and \"The Vagabonds\". \"The Shoes of the Fisherman\", both Morris L. West's novel and its 1968 film adaptation, had the titular pope as having been its former archbishop.\n\nLviv has established many city-feasts, such as coffee and chocolate feasts, cheese & wine holiday, the feast of pampukh, the Day of Batyar, Annual Bread Day and others. Over 50 festivals happen in Lviv, such as Alfa Jazz Fest, an international jazz festival; the Leopolis Grand Prix, an international festival of vintage cars; international festival of academic music Virtuosi; Stare Misto Rock Fest; medieval festival Lviv Legend; international Etnovyr folklore festival, initiated by UNESCO; international festival of visual art Wiz-Art; international theatrical festival Golden Lion; Lviv Lumines Fluorescent Art Festival; Festival of Contemporary Dramaturgy; international contemporary music festival Contrasts; Lviv international literary festival, Krayina Mriy; gastronomic festival Lviv on a Plate; organ music festival Diapason; international independent film festival KinoLev; international festival LvivKlezFest; and international media festival MediaDepo.\n\nHistorically, the first horse-drawn tramway lines in Lviv were inaugurated on 5 May 1880. An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are narrow-gauge, unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town. The Lviv tramway system now runs about 220 cars on of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2011 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 1.50 UAH (reduced fare ticket was 0.60 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.\n\nAfter World War II the city grew rapidly due to evacuees returning from Russia, and the Soviet Government's vigorous development of heavy industry. This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly \"liberated\" territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with trolleybuses on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the blocks of flats at the city outskirts. The network now runs about 100 trolleybuses – mostly of the 1980s Skoda 14Tr and . In 2006–2008 11 modern low-floor trolleybuses (LAZ E183) built by the Lviv Bus Factory were purchased. The public bus network is represented by mini-buses (so-called \"marshrutka\") and large buses mainly LAZ and MAN. On 1 January 2013 the city had 52 public bus routes. The price is 4.00 UAH regardless of the distance traveled. No tickets are provided – and the money is paid to the driver. The price of a tram/trolleybus ticket is 3.00 UAH (reduced fare ticket is 1.00 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.\n\nModern Lviv remains a hub on which nine railways converge providing local and international services. Lviv railway is one of the oldest in Ukraine. The first train arrived in Lviv on 4 November 1861. The main Lviv Railway Station, designed by Władysław Sadłowski, was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and the technical aspects.\n\nIn the interbellum period, Lviv (known then as Lwów) was one of the most important hubs of the Polish State Railways. The Lwów junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 – main station \"Lwów Główny\" (now ), Lwów Kleparów (now \"Lviv Klepariv\"), \"Lwów Łyczaków\" (now \"Lviv Lychakiv\"), and \"Lwów Podzamcze\" (now \"Lviv Pidzamche\"). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lwów was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, Bucharest, and Budapest.\n\nCurrently, several trains cross the nearby Polish–Ukrainian border (mostly via Przemyśl in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia (Košice) and Hungary (Budapest). Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the \"Schengen\" countries.\n\nLviv used to have a Railbus, which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the rail bus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.\n\nBeginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine \"Astronauta\" but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the Lviv Polytechnic, including Stefan Drzewiecki and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the \"First Aviation Exhibition\" which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.\n\nIn 1913–1914 brothers Tadeusz and Władysław Floriańscy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floriański brothers' plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of Stefan Bastyr and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first ever flight under the Polish flag taking off from Lviv's Lewandówka (now ) airport. In the interbellum period Lwów was a major centre of gliding with a notable \"Gliding School\" in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lwów and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the \"First Polish Aircraft Exhibition\" took place in the city.\n\nThe interwar Lwów was also a major centre of the Polish Air Force with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lwów airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skniłów (today ). The airport is located from the city centre. In 2012, after renovation, Lviv Airport got a new official name Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport (LWO). A new terminal and other improvements worth under a $200 million has been done in preparation for the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship. The connection from Airport to the city centre is maintained by bus No. 48 and No. 9.\n\nCycling is a new but growing mode of transport in Lviv. In 2011 the City of Lviv ratified an ambitious 9-year program for the set-up of cycling infrastructure – until the year 2019 an overall length of cycle lanes and tracks shall be realized. A working group formally organised within the City Council, bringing together representatives of the city administration, members of planning and design institutes, local NGOs and other stakeholders. Events like the All-Ukrainian Bikeday or the European Mobility Week show the popularity of cycling among Lviv's citizens.\n\nBy September 2011, of new cycling infrastructure had been built. It can be expected that until the end of the 2011 will be ready for use. The cycling advisor in Lviv – the first such position in Ukraine – is supervising and pushing forward the execution of the cycling plan and coordinates with various people in the city. The development of cycling in Ukraine is currently hampered by outdated planning norms and the fact, that most planners didn't yet plan and experience cycling infrastructure. The update of national legislation and training for planners is therefore necessary.\n\nIn 2015, the first stations have been set up for a new bike-sharing system Nextbike – the first of its kind in Ukraine. New bike lanes are also under construction, making Lviv the most bike-friendly city in the country. The City Council plans to build an entire cycling infrastructure by 2020, with cycle lanes () and street bike hire services.\n\nLviv is an important education centre of Ukraine. The city contains a total of 12 universities, 8 academies and a number of smaller schools of higher education. In addition, within Lviv, there is a total of eight institutes of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine and more than forty research institutes. These research institutes include the Centre of Institute for Space Research; the Institute for Condensed Matter Physics; the Institute of Cell Biology; the National Institute of Strategic Studies; the Institute of Neuro-mathematical Simulation in Power Engineering; and the Institute of Ecology of the Carpathians.\n\nIn Soviet times, the city of Lviv was the location where the software for the Lunokhod programme was developed. The technology for the Venera series probes and the first orbital shuttle Buran were also developed in Lviv.\n\nA considerable scientific potential is concentrated in the city: by the number of doctors of sciences, candidates of sciences, scientific organisations Lviv is the fourth city in Ukraine. Lviv is also known for ancient academic traditions, founded by the Assumption Brotherhood School and the Jesuit Collegium. Over 100,000 students annually study in more than 50 higher educational establishments.\n\nEducational level of residents:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1463660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1463660", "title": "Margaret Dongo", "text": "Margaret Dongo\n\nMargaret Dongo (born 14 March 1960) is a Zimbabwean politician known for speaking in favor of women's rights and out against corruption. She was an ex-combatant of the 1970s liberation war, served in parliament, and helped establish the Zimbabwe Union of Democrats (ZUD).\n\nIn 1975, at age 15, Dongo left secondary school to cross into Mozambique and join the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), adopting the moniker \"Tichaona Muhondo\" (\"The Battle will Decide\"). She described then-ZANLA commander Josiah Tongogara as \"principled. He was unwavering in knowing what he was fighting for and could not easily be driven into corruption. I believed in him.\" In December 1979 Dongo was one of the last people to see him alive, explaining later that \"We were 18 girls who were having a function and he came to say a few words to bless the occasion.\"\n\nWith the ceasefire, Dongo took a typing course and obtained a telex diploma. In 1980 she worked for the ruling ZANU-PF party in a variety of roles, and then in Mugabe's Prime Ministerial office. She married and had three children.\n\nIn 1989 she co-founded the National Liberation War Veterans Association to secure the rights of marginalised war veterans. In 1990, sponsored by the NLWVA, Dongo became an MP for Harare East. In Parliament she was an advocate of democracy, human rights, and marginalised groups in Zimbabwe. Her willingness to challenge the ZANU-PF leadership when she felt they had not helped on these issues led to her deselection, and at the 1995 election the boundaries of her constituency were altered in a way unfavourable to her chances of holding the seat.\n\nShe stood again for Harare South as an Independent against ZANU-PF's Vivian Mwashita in 1995. After her defeat by 1,000 votes was announced, Dongo was convinced that the election had been rigged, and challenged the result in court. The subsequent case revealed serious defects in the electoral roll, including the registration of many non-resident voters, suggesting that at least 41% of the names on the roll were inaccurate, and the court judgment in August 1995 invalidated the election. She went back to Harare South as an independent candidate in the re-run. On 25 November 1995 she won the rerun with 3,075 votes to 1,630 for Mwashita, and continued her fight in parliament as a strong advocate for human rights and democracy. She was one of only three opposition MPs.\n\nDongo hoped to oppose Robert Mugabe in the 1996 Presidential elections but did not meet the minimum age requirement of 40 years. She called on Bishop Abel Muzorewa and Ndabaningi Sithole to withdraw from the election because their participation lent it legitimacy, remarking that \"the presidential elections are only for the consumption of the international and donor community, and not for oppressed Zimbabweans\". Both did eventually withdraw. The Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation was said to have banned its reporters from covering her activities.\n\nOn 19 December 1998 Dongo formed the Zimbabwe Union of Democrats in preparation for the 2000 elections. However, she did not get on with Morgan Tsvangirai and the Movement for Democratic Change when that party was created to challenge ZANU-PF control, and the ZUD remained small. Dongo regarded the MDC as being comparable to the Movement for Multiparty Democracy in Zambia which had failed, in her analysis, to live up to its name despite defeating Kenneth Kaunda.\n\nAfter the 2000 land redistribution, she requested and received a parliamentary written answer in January 2001 detailing beneficiaries. Including land rented out under the tenant farm scheme since 1990, only a handful of these, which range from very large farms to smallholdings, had been given to genuine farmers. According to her, the majority of state-owned commercial farms leased out under Zimbabwe's land resettlement programme had been given to well-connected individuals, most of whom are absentee landlords with no farming experience. Many of the new owners had been given leases for 98 years at advantageous prices, while others have yet to have their lease rates assessed.\n\nShe said: \"I appeal to my fellow war veterans not to let your suffering be used by selfish and greedy politicians who caused your suffering. This will not benefit you at the end of the day. Comrades, you should stand up and be a watchdog of the government.

He is also a noted New Zealand historian, and has published a number of books on New Zealand politics, including biographies of Prime Ministers Peter Fraser, Gordon Coates and Joseph Ward.\n\nBassett was born in 1938 in Auckland and educated at Owairaka School, Dilworth School, Mt Albert Grammar, and the University of Auckland. He completed BA and MA degrees in history at the University of Auckland before winning a fellowship to Duke University in the United States in 1961. He completed a PhD in American history there, completing a dissertation entitled \"The Socialist Party of America, 1912–1919: Years of Decline.\"\n\nIn 1964, Bassett returned to New Zealand and became a senior lecturer in history at the University of Auckland. During this time he was a member of the Princes Street Labour branch.\n\nBassett stood unsuccessfully for the Labour Party in the for and in the for .\n\nIn 1971 Bassett was elected to the Auckland City Council. In the following year, he was elected as a Labour MP for Waitemata in the 1972 election, and the Labour Party became the government for the first time since 1960. Following the death of Prime Minister Norman Kirk the party (and Bassett) were defeated in the following (1975) election. In his account on the Third Labour Government, Bassett described it as one of \"the most active and socially responsible governments of the twentieth century.\"\n\nBassett was elected to the Te Atatu electorate in the 1978 election, and held it to 1990.\n\nIn 1984, a landslide to Labour resulted in New Zealand's fourth Labour government. Bassett was appointed as Minister of Health and Local Government (1984–1987), and Minister of Internal Affairs, Local Government, Civil Defence and Arts and Culture (1987–1990). He was chairman of the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board and of the 1990 Commission, tasked with the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. In his capacity as Minister of Internal Affairs he also helped reorganise Waitangi Day celebrations and encourage them around New Zealand.\n\nThe Fourth Labour government enacted a major programme of economic and social reform, the economic arm of which is known as Rogernomics. Major social reforms included the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986. Bassett was a wholehearted supporter of the reforms, and when the government and party schismed over issues of economic reform, Bassett took the side of finance minister Roger Douglas, the main architect of the reforms. In 1990, Labour was defeated in another landslide election. Bassett did not contest the 1990 election, and retired from active politics.\n\nHe continued occasionally to be involved at an advisory level, for example unofficially advising Don Brash during his term as National Party leader. Bassett's switch of sides reflects the present-day Labour Party's semi-repudiation of Rogernomics.\n\nBassett resumed his academic career, publishing several books on New Zealand political history, and contributing to the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography and the British Dictionary of National Biography. He was a Professor of History at the University of Western Ontario on and off from 1992 to 1996, taught at the Auckland University Medical School from 1997 to 2000, and was a Fulbright Professor of New Zealand Studies at Georgetown University, Washington DC.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2004 Bassett was a member of the Waitangi Tribunal, which investigates breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nHe was a columnist for \"The Dominion Post\" in Wellington (until late 2006) and \"The Press\" in Christchurch.\n\nIn his article \"The Essentials of Successful Political Leadership in Twentieth Century New Zealand Politics\", Bassett outlined the factors he thought were required for a Prime Minister to be successful. These factors include robust health, high energy levels, a good temperament, intelligence, a willingness to take the right, as opposed to the politically expedient, decision, a modicum of luck, a supportive spouse and charisma.\n\nBassett is married to Judith Bassett, a historian at the University of Auckland and a member of the Auckland Regional Council. They have two children and one grandchild.\n\nBassett is a third cousin of late Prime Minister David Lange. Bassett had suggested that Lange should stand on the Labour ticket for the Auckland City Council in 1974. The Council was dominated by conservative interests and the only Labour candidates elected were Jim Anderton and Catherine Tizard; Lange was \"halfway down the field ... which was better than I expected\". Lange's father, who was a doctor, had delivered Bassett. Lange wrote (presumably jokingly referring to Bassett's appointment to Cabinet and their later disagreements): \"My father had delivered him, and it became plain in later days that he must have dropped him ...\"\n\nIn the 1992 Queen's Birthday Honours, Bassett was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. He was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as an historian, in the 2018 New Year Honours.\n\n\n\n"}

In other words, these Protestant churches dissent from the established church. Examples include the Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Unitarian denominations, and the Quakers (formally, the Society of Friends).\n\nFollowing Hardwick's Marriage Act of 1753, all English and Welsh marriages (except those of Quakers and Jews) had to take place in a Church of England parish church. However, any baptisms and burials (or equivalent ceremonies) from other denominations might take place within their own churches and chapels, and these were often recorded in their own nonconformist registers. Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that there was no legal obligation for them to record any such events. A significant number of early nonconformist chapels never maintained any such registers, or they maintained them only sporadically. In earlier centuries such omissions might sometimes be partly due to fear of persecution. Occasionally marriages in places of worship elsewhere might also be recorded (sometimes involving more than one ceremony), although such entries originally had no strict legal status.\n\nRegisters of baptisms, marriages and burials of many nonconformist churches were collected and validated by the British government in 1837. These may be viewed at the Public Record Office in series \"RG 4\". This followed long pressure for such unofficial registers to be given a measure of legal recognition. It had already resulted in an earlier system of limited registration for dissenters being established at Dr Williams's Library in London. Some local chapels promptly abandoned keeping their own registers, at least for a while, after this date (which coincided with the start of civil registration in England & Wales). However a second tranche of nonconformist registers was transferred to London after 1857, following a further report by a government commission.\n\nAfter 1837 marriages could take place in many other licensed nonconformist chapels, provided that the local Superintendent Registrar was in attendance. Eventually the Marriage Act of 1898 enabled some of these chapels to dispense with this requirement, provided that they designated an Appointed Person (usually the minister or priest), who would be responsible for maintaining an official marriage register.\n\nMany nonconformist registers have now been deposited in approved repositories, such as the local county record office. However different churches operate different policies, and it will often be found that rates of creation and survival for such records are less good than for other types of parish register. A number of such registers have also started to appear online.\n"}

One who writes scholia is a scholiast. The earliest attested use of the word dates to the 1st century BC.\n\nAncient scholia are important sources of information about many aspects of the ancient world, especially ancient literary history. The earliest scholia, usually anonymous, date to the 5th or 4th century BC (such as the \"a\" scholia on the \"Iliad\"). The practice of compiling scholia continued to late Byzantine times, outstanding examples being Archbishop Eustathius' massive commentaries to Homer in the 12th century and the \"scholia recentiora\" of Thomas Magister and Demetrius Triclinius in the 14th.\n\nScholia were altered by successive copyists and owners of the manuscript, and in some cases, increased to such an extent that there was no longer room for them in the margin, and it became necessary to make them into a separate work. At first, they were taken from one commentary only, subsequently from several. This is indicated by the repetition of the lemma (\"headword\"), or by the use of such phrases as \"or thus\", \"alternatively\", \"according to some\", to introduce different explanations, or by the explicit quotation of different sources.\n\nThe most important are those on the Homeric \"Iliad\", especially those found in the 10th-century manuscripts discovered by Villoison in 1781 in the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice (see further Venetus A, Homeric scholarship). The scholia on Hesiod, Pindar, Sophocles, Aristophanes and Apollonius Rhodius are also extremely important. In Latin, the most important are those of Servius on Virgil, of Acro and Porphyrio on Horace, and of Donatus on Terence.\n\nSome ancient scholia are of sufficient quality and importance to be labelled \"commentaries\" instead. The existence of a commercial translation is often used to distinguish between \"scholia\" and \"commentaries\".

She is best known for her play \"Machinal\" which is often included in drama anthologies as an example of an expressionist or modernist play. Treadwell wrote dozens of plays, several novels, as well as serial stories and countless articles that appeared in newspapers. In addition to writing plays for the theatre, Treadwell also produced, directed and acted in some of her productions. The styles and subjects of Treadwell's writings are vast, but many present women's issues of her time, subjects of current media coverage, or aspects of Treadwell's Mexican heritage.\n\nSophie Anita Treadwell was born in 1885 in Stockton, California. Between 1890 and 1891, Treadwell's father, Alfred Treadwell, deserted her and her mother, Nettie Fairchild Treadwell, and moved to San Francisco. Although Treadwell originally excelled at school, after her father left she struggled, which others have attributed to the frequency with which she and her mother relocated. While Treadwell primarily lived with her mother, occasionally Treadwell would spend summers in San Francisco with her father. During these visits, Treadwell was first exposed to theatre; she witnessed famous actresses Helena Modjeska and Sarah Bernhardt in \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"Phèdre\", respectively. In 1902, Treadwell and her mother moved to San Francisco.\n\nAlthough Treadwell's father was also born in Stockton, CA, he spent most of his formative years in Mexico with his native-born mother. Both Treadwell's paternal grandmother and great-grandmother were Mexican women of Spanish descent. Treadwell's father had a Catholic education and was fluent in five languages. Treadwell's strong female role model was her grandmother Anna Gray Fairchild, a Scottish immigrant, who managed the family's large ranch in Stockton after the death of her husband. Traces of Treadwell's heritage—both Mexican and European can be gleaned from her works, as can references to her parents' troubled marriage and her time spent at the ranch in Stockton.\n\nTreadwell received her Bachelor of Letters in French from the University of California at Berkeley, where she studied from 1902–1906. At Berkeley, Treadwell became very involved with the school's extracurricular drama and journalism activities, serving as the college's correspondent for The San Francisco Examiner. Due to financial pressure, Treadwell had to work several jobs during her studies; receiving additional training in shorthand and typing, teaching English as a second language in the evenings, as well as working in the circulation department of the San Francisco Call. It was also during this time that she first began to write; early drafts of shorter plays, songs, and short fictional stories. During college, Treadwell had her first brushes with mental illness, a variety of nervous conditions that would plague her and lead to several extended hospitalizations throughout her life.\n\nAfter college, Treadwell moved to Los Angeles where she worked for a brief time as a vaudeville singer. She then studied acting and was mentored by renowned Polish actress Helena Modjeska, whose memoirs she was hired to write in 1908. In 1910, Treadwell married William O. McGeehan, better known as 'Mac', a beloved sports writer for the \"San Francisco Bulletin\".\n\nIn 1915, Treadwell moved to New York, following her husband who had already made the cross-country move for his career. In New York, Treadwell joined the Lucy Stone League of suffragettes. Treadwell participated in a 150-mile march with the League, which delivered a petition on women's suffrage to the legislature of New York. Treadwell maintained a separate residence from her husband, an idea encouraged by the League. Her marriage was said to be one of mutual independence and acceptance of differing interests.\n\nIn New York, Treadwell befriended and became associated with many well known modernist personalities and modern artists of the time, notably Louise and Walter Arensberg who ran a New York Salon, and painter Marcel Duchamp. Congruous with Treadwell's advocacy for sexual independence, birth control rights, and increased sexual freedom for women, Treadwell had a brief affair with the artist Maynard Dixon between 1916–1919.\n\nTreadwell reached the peak of her professional career in journalism and in theatre in New York in the 1920s. Treadwell attended lectures and completed an extensive study with Richard Boleslavsky of the Moscow Art Theatre which proved to be both influential and motivational for Treadwell's varied theatrical pursuits. Treadwell underwent media controversy in the mid-20s for a drawn out dispute with the famous John Barrymore; Barrymore attempted to produce a play about Edgar Allan Poe supposedly written by his wife Michael Strange, which borrowed heavily from a manuscript that Treadwell had written and shared with him years prior. Treadwell brought a lawsuit against Barrymore for stoppage of the play and won, although she was criticized heavily in the media.\n\nTreadwell lectured and advocated openly for authors rights and was the first American playwright to win royalty payments for a play production from the Soviet Union. In addition to her accomplishments, Treadwell traveled often with 'Mac' across the United States, Europe, and Northern Africa. Treadwell's husband died in 1933 due to heart complications, while they were on vacation in the state of Georgia.\n\nTreadwell set herself apart from many female writers of her day, by pursuing commercial productions of her works on Broadway. Seven of Treadwell's plays, listed below, appeared on the Great White Way between 1922–1941. \"Gringo\" was Treadwell's first play to be produced on Broadway. Most of these plays were only written by Treadwell, but she also produced \"Lone Valley\" and \"O, Nightingale\", the later of which she even staged. New York became the setting for the majority of Treadwell's plays.\nCritics often negatively judged Treadwell's plays as having poorly developed plots, unsympathetic characters, or objectionable themes. Treadwell was also known for having tense relationships with producers because she was reluctant to accept their feedback and edit her work.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60's Treadwell turned to writing mostly fiction in the form of short stories and novels, which may be influenced by the lack of success from her Broadway ventures. Treadwell lived for a time as an expatriate in Vienna, Austria as well as in Torremolinos in Southern Spain. When Sophie returned to the U.S. she lived in Newton, Connecticut, but also spent time in Mexico and Stockton. In 1949, Treadwell adopted a young German boy, whom she named William. Sophie retired in the mid-60s to Tucson, Arizona where she spent her final years. After a brief hospital stay, Treadwell died on February 20, 1970.\n\nTreadwell is credited with writing at least 39 plays, numerous serials and journalistic articles, short stories, and several novels. The subjects of her writings are as diverse as the mediums she was writing in. Many of Treadwell's works are difficult to obtain and the majority of her plays have not previously been produced.\n\nMany of Treadwell's plays follow the traditional late nineteenth century well-made play structure, but some share the more modern style and feminist concerns Treadwell is known for, including her often anthologized \"Machinal\". Although Treadwell's plays primarily feature lead female characters, the women presented vary greatly in their behavior, beliefs, and social status. Some of Treadwell's plays contain hints of autobiography from Treadwell's heritage to her extra-marital affair. Below is a chronological chart of her known works.\n\nTreadwell's first job as a journalist was with the San Francisco Bulletin, where she was hired in 1908 as a feature writer and theatre critic. She interviewed celebrities, such as Jack London, and covered several high-profile murder trials. Later, when living in New York, Treadwell covered the murder trials of Ruth Snyder and Judd Gray whose stories influenced subsequent plays. Treadwell also wrote two popular serial stories for the Bulletin, one based on Treadwell's under cover research about charity available to women in need for which Treadwell disguised herself as a homeless prostitute, the other was a fiction titled \"How I Got My Husband and How I Lost Him\" which provided the source material for her later play \"Sympathy\".\n\nTreadwell traveled to France to cover the First World War; she was only female foreign correspondent writing from overseas at that time, accredited by the State Department. Because Treadwell was not permitted access to the front lines, she volunteered as a nurse and focused her writing on the effect the war was having on the women in Europe. In 1915, Harper's Weekly published her feature \"Women in Black\".\n\nWhen Sophie returned to New York, she was hired by the \"New York American\", later renamed \"New York Herald Tribune\" where she wrote as a journalist and served as an expert on Mexican-American relations and Mexico. In 1920, Sophie covered the end of the Mexican revolution and wrote a front page piece on the flight of Mexican President Don Venustiano Carranza. In 1921, she was the only foreign journalist permitted to interview Pancho Villa. That two-day interview gained Treadwell notoriety in the journalism field as well as provided a basis for Sophie's first Broadway play \"Gringo\" and her later novel \"Lusita\". In 1941, Sophie spent ten months in Mexico City as a correspondent for the Tribune. Years later, Treadwell wrote for the Tribune about her visit to post-war Germany.\n\nAlthough Treadwell was writing during the height of the Little Theatre Movement in the United States, her desire to produce her works on Broadway for mainstream audiences set her apart from her contemporaries. Treadwell was only peripherally involved in the movement through her work at the Provincetown Players during their early existence.\n\nNoteworthy women playwrights writing in the same era as Treadwell are:\n\nThrough the use of various 'isms' these playwrights explored new and alternative ways of presenting women's lives in their plays.\n\nTreadwell remained widely unknown and un-talked about in the world of theatre scholarship until select feminist scholars resuscitated interest in her works following revivals of \"Machinal\" in 1990 by the New York Shakespeare Festival and in 1993 by the Royal National Theatre in London.\n\nThe majority of Treadwell's works are stored at the University of Arizona Library Special Collections and the rest at The Billy Rose Theatre Collection at the New York Public Library. The rights to Treadwell's works were passed on in her will to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson: A Corporation Sole. One who wishes to obtain the rights to Treadwell's plays can address an enquiry to: Fiscal and Administrative Services, Diocese of Tucson, PO Box 31, Tucson, AZ 85702.

{"id": "72243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72243", "title": "Surname", "text": "Surname\n\nA surname, family name, or last name is the portion (in some cultures) of a personal name that indicates a person's family (or tribe or community, depending on the culture). Depending on the culture, all members of a family unit may have identical surnames or there may be variations based on the cultural rules.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, a surname is commonly referred to as a last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's full name, after any given names. In many parts of Asia, as well as some parts of Europe and Africa, the family name is placed before a person's given name. In most Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking countries, two surnames are commonly used and in some families that claim a connection to nobility even three are used.\n\nSurnames have not always existed and today are not universal in all cultures. This tradition has arisen separately in different cultures around the world. In Europe, the concept of surnames became popular in the Roman Empire and expanded throughout the Mediterranean and Western Europe as a result. During the Middle Ages this practice died out as Germanic, Persian, and other influences took hold. During the late Middle Ages surnames gradually re-emerged, first in the form of bynames (typically indicating individual's occupation or area of residence), which gradually evolved into modern surnames. In China surnames have been the norm since at least the 2nd century BC.\n\nA family name is typically a part of a person's personal name which, according to law or custom, is passed or given to children from one or both of their parents' family names. The use of family names is common in most cultures around the world, with each culture having its own rules as to how these names are formed, passed and used. However, the style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (forename) is far from universal. In many cultures, it is common for people to have one name or mononym, with some cultures not using family names. In most Slavic countries, as well as other countries including Greece and Iceland, for example, there are different family name forms for male and female members of the family. Issues of family name arise especially on the passing of a name to a new-born child, on the adoption of a common family name on marriage, on renouncing of a family name and on changing of a family name.\n\nSurname laws vary around the world. Traditionally in many European countries for the past few hundred years, it was the custom or law that a woman would on marriage use the surname of her husband and that children of a man would have the father's surname. If a child's paternity was not known, or if the putative father denied paternity, the new-born child would have the surname of the mother. That is still the custom or law in many countries. The surname for children of married parents is usually inherited from the father. In recent years there has been a trend towards equality of treatment in relation to family names, with women being not automatically required or expected, or in some places even forbidden, to take the husband's surname on marriage, and children not automatically being given the father's surname. In this article, family name and surname both mean the patrilineal surname, handed down from or inherited from the father's, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, the term \"maternal surname\" means the \"patrilineal\" surname which one's mother inherited from either or both of her parents. For a discussion of \"matrilineal\" ('mother-line') surnames, passing from mothers to daughters, see matrilineal surname.\n\nIn English-speaking cultures, family names are often used by children when referring to adults, but are also used to refer to someone in authority, the elderly, or in a formal setting, and are often used with a title or honorific such as Mr., Mrs., Ms., Miss, Doctor, and so on. It is also common in English-speaking cultures for individuals to be referred to by their surname instead of their given name by their friends. Generally the given name, first name, forename, or personal name is the one used by friends, family, and other intimates to address an individual. It may also be used by someone who is in some way senior to the person being addressed. This practice also differs between cultures; see T–V distinction.\n\nThe study of proper names (in family names, personal names, or places) is called onomastics. A one-name study is a collection of vital and other biographical data about all persons worldwide sharing a particular surname.\n\nIn many cultures (particularly in European and European-influenced cultures in the Americas, Oceania, etc., as well as the Middle East, South Asia, and most African cultures), the surname or family name (\"last name\") is placed after the personal, forename (in Europe) or given name (\"first name\"). In other cultures the surname is placed first, followed by the given name or names. The latter is often called the Eastern order because Europeans are most familiar with the examples from the East Asian cultural sphere, specifically Japan, China (mainland and Taiwan), Korea (Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and Vietnam. This is also the case in Hungary, Romania, Bavaria, Austria, Albania and Kosovo, parts of South India, Sri Lanka, and Madagascar.\n\nSince family names are normally written last in European societies, the terms last name or surname are commonly used for the family name, while in Japan (with vertical writing) the family name may be referred to as upper name ().\n\nWhen those from Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong write their personal name in the Latin alphabet, it is common to reverse the order of the given and family names for the convenience of Westerners, so that they know which name is the family name for official/formal purposes. Reversing the order of names for the same reason is also customary for the Baltic Fennic peoples and the Hungarians, but other Uralic peoples traditionally did not have surnames, perhaps because of the clan structure of their societies. The Samis saw no change or a transformation of their name. For example: some Sire became Siri, Hætta Jáhkoš Ásslat became Aslak Jacobsen Hætta — as was the norm. Recently, integration into the EU and increased communications with foreigners prompted many Samis to reverse the order of their full name to given name followed by surname, to avoid their given name being mistaken for and used as a surname.\n\nIndian surnames may often denote caste, profession, and village and are invariably mentioned along with the personal names. However, hereditary last names are not universal. In Indian passports the surname is shown first. In telephone directories the surname is used for collation. In North Indian states the surname is placed after given names where it exists. In parts of south India, surname is placed before personal name and in most cases it is only shown as an initial (for example 'S.' for Suryapeth).\n\nIn English and other languages like Spanish—although the usual order of names is \"first middle last\"—for the purpose of cataloging in libraries and in citing the names of authors in scholarly papers, the order is changed to \"last, first middle,\" with the last and first names separated by a comma, and items are alphabetized by the last name. In France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Latin America, administrative usage is to put the surname before the first on official documents.\n\nWhile given names have been used from the most distant times to identify individuals, the advent of surnames is a relatively recent phenomenon. A four-year study led by the University of the West of England, which concluded in 2016, analysed sources dating from the 11th to the 19th century to explain the origins of the surnames in the British isles. The study found that over 90% of the 45,602 surnames in the dictionary are native to Britain and Ireland, with the most common in the UK being Smith, Jones, Williams, Brown, Taylor, Johnson, and Lee. The findings have been published in the \"Oxford English Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland\", with project leader, Professor Richard Coates calling the study \"more detailed and accurate\" than those before. He elaborated on the origins; \"Some surnames have origins that are occupational – obvious examples are Smith and Baker. Other names can be linked to a place, for example Hill or Green, which relates to a village green. Surnames which are 'patronymic' are those which originally enshrined the father's name – such as Jackson, or Jenkinson. There are also names where the origin describes the original bearer such as Brown, Short, or Thin – though Short may in fact be an ironic 'nickname' surname for a tall person.\"\n\nBy 1400, most English and some Scottish people used surnames, but many Scottish and Welsh people did not adopt surnames until the 17th century, or later. Henry VIII (ruled 1509–1547) ordered that marital births be recorded under the surname of the father. In England and cultures derived from there, there has long been a tradition for a woman to change her surname upon marriage from her birth name to her husband's family name. (See Maiden and married names.) The first known instance in the United States of a woman insisting on the use of her birth name was that of Lucy Stone in 1855; and there has been a general increase in the rate of women using their birth name. This has gone through periods of flux, however, and the 1990s saw a decline in the percentage of name retention among women. As of 2006, more than 80% of American women adopted the husband's family name after marriage.\n\nMany cultures have used and continue to use additional descriptive terms in identifying individuals. These terms may indicate personal attributes, location of origin, occupation, parentage, patronage, adoption, or clan affiliation. These descriptors often developed into fixed clan identifications that in turn became family names as we know them today.\n\nIn China, according to legend, family names started with Emperor Fu Xi in 2852 BC. His administration standardised the naming system in order to facilitate census-taking, and the use of census information. Originally, Chinese surnames were derived matrilineally, although by the time of the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 BCE) they had become patrilineal. Chinese women do not change their names upon marriage. They can be referred to either as their full birth names or as their husband's surname plus the word for wife. In the past, women's given name were often not publicly known and women were referred in official documents by their family name plus the character \"Shi\" and when married by their husband's surname, their birth surname, and the character \"Shi.\"\n\nIn Japan, family names were uncommon except among the aristocracy until the 19th century.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, during some periods, formal identification commonly included place of origin. At other times clan names and patronymics (\"son of\") were also common, as in Aristides Lysimachu. For example, Alexander the Great was known as \"Heracleides\", as a supposed descendant of Heracles, and by the dynastic name \"Karanos\"/\"Caranus\", which referred to the founder of the dynasty to which he belonged. In none of these cases, though, were these names considered essential parts of the person's name, nor were they explicitly inherited in the manner that is common in many cultures today.\n\nIn the Roman Empire, the bestowal and use of clan and family names waxed and waned with changes in the various subcultures of the realm. (\"See Roman naming conventions.\") The nomen, which was the gens name, was inherited much like last names are, but their purposes were quite different. In later Europe, last names were developed to distinguish between individuals. The nomen were to identify group kinship. The praenomen was the \"forename\" and was originally used like a first name today. In later times, praenomen became less useful for distinguishing individuals as it was often passed down for males along with the nomen (like an entire culture where \"John Smith, Jr.\" was the norm), and females, were often given no praenomen at all or functional names like Major and Minor (\"Older\" and \"Younger\") or Maxima, Maio, and Mino (\"Biggest,\" \"Middle,\" \"Littlest\") or ordinal numbers rather than what we might think of as names: Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, etc. Around this time, the nomen became followed by one or more additional names called cognomen. It became usual that one of these cognomen was inherited, but as the praenomen and nomen became more rigidly used and less useful for identifying individuals, additional personal cognomen were more often used, to the point that the first the praenomen and then the nomen fell out of use entirely. With the gradual influence of Greek and Christian culture throughout the Empire, Christian religious names were sometimes put in front of traditional cognomen, but eventually, people reverted to single names. By the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, family names were uncommon in the Eastern Roman Empire. In Western Europe, where Germanic culture dominated the aristocracy, family names were almost non-existent. They would not significantly reappear again in Eastern Roman society until the 10th century, apparently influenced by the familial affiliations of the Armenian military aristocracy. The practice of using family names spread through the Eastern Roman Empire and gradually into Western Europe, although it was not until the modern era that family names came to be explicitly inherited as they are today.\n\nIn Ireland, the use of surnames has a very old history. Ireland was the first country in Europe to use fixed surnames. As noted in the Annals, the first recorded fixed surname was Ó Cleirigh, which recorded the death of Tigherneach Ua Cleirigh, lord of Aidhne in Galway in the year 916.\n\nIn England, the introduction of family names is generally attributed to the preparation of the Domesday Book in 1086, following the Norman conquest. Evidence indicates that surnames were first adopted among the feudal nobility and gentry, and slowly spread to other parts of society. Some of the early Norman nobility who arrived in England during the Norman conquest differentiated themselves by affixing 'de' (of) before the name of their village in France. This is what is known as a territorial surname, a consequence of feudal landownership. In medieval times in France, such a name indicated lordship, or ownership, of the village. Some early Norman nobles in England chose to drop the French derivations and call themselves instead after their new English holdings.\n\nSurnames were uncommon prior to the 12th century, and still somewhat rare into the 13th; most European surnames were originally occupational or locational, and served to distinguish one person from another if they happened to live near one another (e.g., two different people named John could conceivably be identified as 'John Butcher' and 'John Chandler'). This still happens, in some communities where a surname is particularly common.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, when a man from a lower-status family married an only daughter from a higher-status family, he would often adopt the wife's family name. In the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, bequests were sometimes made contingent upon a man's changing (or hyphenating) his family name, so that the name of the testator continued. It is rare but not unknown for an English-speaking man to take his wife's family name, whether for personal reasons or as a matter of tradition (such as among matrilineal Canadian aboriginal groups, such as the Haida and Gitxsan); it is exceedingly rare but does occur in the United States, where a married couple may choose an entirely new last name by going through a legal change of name. As an alternative, both spouses may adopt a double-barrelled name. For instance, when John Smith and Mary Jones marry each other, they may become known as \"John Smith-Jones\" and \"Mary Smith-Jones\". A spouse may also opt to use their birth name as a middle name. An additional option, although rarely practiced, is the adoption of a last name derived from a blend of the prior names, such as \"Simones\", which also requires a legal name change. Some couples keep their own last names but give their children hyphenated or combined surnames.\n\nIn medieval Spain, a patronymic system was used. For example, Álvaro, the son of Rodrigo would be named Álvaro Rodríguez. His son, Juan, would not be named Juan Rodríguez, but Juan Álvarez. Over time, many of these patronymics became family names and are some of the most common names in the Spanish-speaking world. Other sources of surnames are personal appearance or habit, e.g. Delgado (\"thin\") and Moreno (\"dark\"); occupations, e.g. Molinero (\"miller\"), Zapatero (\"shoe-maker\") and Guerrero (\"warrior\"); and geographic location or ethnicity, e.g. Alemán (\"German\").\n\nDuring the modern era, many cultures around the world adopted family names, particularly for administrative reasons, especially during the age of European expansion and particularly since 1600. Notable examples include the Netherlands (1795–1811), Japan (1870s), Thailand (1920), and Turkey (1934). Nonetheless, their use is not universal: Icelanders, Tibetans, Burmese, Javanese, and many people groups in East Africa do not use family names.\n\nFamily names sometimes change or are replaced by non-family-name surnames under political pressure to avoid persecution. Examples are the cases with Chinese Indonesians and Chinese Thais after migration there during the 20th century, or the Jews who fled to different European countries to avoid persecution from the Nazis during World War II.\n\nThe United States followed the naming customs and practices of English common law and traditions until recent times. Beginning in the latter half of the 20th century, traditional naming practices, writes one commentator, were recognized as \"com[ing] into conflict with current sensitivities about children's and women's rights.\" Those changes accelerated a shift away from the interests of the parents to a focus on the best interests of the child. The law in this area continues to evolve today mainly in the context of paternity and custody actions.\n\nUpon marriage to a woman, men in the United States can easily change their surnames to that of their wives, or adopt a combination of both names with the federal government, through the Social Security Administration. Men may face difficulty doing so on the state level in some states. In some places, civil rights lawsuits or constitutional amendments changed the law so that men could also easily change their married names (e.g., in British Columbia and California). Québec law permits neither spouse to change surnames.\n\nIn 1979, the United Nations adopted the \"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women\" (\"CEDAW\"), which declared in effect that women and men, and specifically wife and husband, shall have the same rights to choose a \"family name\", as well as a profession and an occupation. For a further description of and treatment of this Convention, see Matriname.\n\nIn France, until 1 January 2005, children were required by law to take the surname of their father. Article 311-21 of the French Civil code now permits parents to give their children the family name of either their father, mother, or a hyphenation of both – although no more than two names can be hyphenated. In cases of disagreement, the father's name applies. This brought France into line with a 1978 declaration by the Council of Europe requiring member governments to take measures to adopt equality of rights in the transmission of family names, a measure that was echoed by the United Nations in 1979. Similar measures were adopted by West Germany (1976), Sweden (1982), Denmark (1983) and Spain (1999). The European Community has been active in eliminating gender discrimination. Several cases concerning discrimination in family names have reached the courts. \"Burghartz v. Switzerland\" challenged the lack of an option for husbands to add the wife's surname to his surname, which they had chosen as the family name, when this option was available for women. \"Losonci Rose and Rose v. Switzerland\" challenged a prohibition on foreign men married to Swiss women keeping their surname if this option was provided in their national law, an option available to women. \"Ünal Tekeli v. Turkey\" challenged prohibitions on women using their surname as the family name, an option only available to men. The Court found all these laws to be in violation of the Convention.\n\nOnly a fraction of surnames in English-speaking countries around the world come from Britain. English speakers' surnames come from all parts of Europe, as well as other continents, with varying anglicization. With a few exceptions, Europe's languages are cognate, so most European surnames have a common etymological origin. Some surnames are monogenetic (derived from one family at a specific place and time); others are polygenetic (coined independently at different places and times).\n\nBasil Cottle classifies European surnames under four broad categories, depending on their origin: given name (patronymics), occupational name, local name (toponymics), and nickname. This classification can be extended to surnames originating elsewhere. Other name etymologists use a fuller classification, but these four types underlie them.\n\nThese are the oldest and most common type of surname. They may be a first name such as \"Wilhelm\", a patronymic such as \"Andersen\", a matronymic such as \"Beaton\", or a clan name such as \"O'Brien\". Multiple surnames may be derived from a single given name: e.g. there are thought to be over 90 Italian surnames based on the given name \"Giovanni\".\nThe Icelandic system, formerly used in much of Scandinavia, does not use family names. A person's last name indicates the first name of their father (patronymic) or in some cases mother (matronymic). Many common family names in other Scandinavian countries are a result of this naming practice, such as Hansen (son of Hans), Johansen (son of Johan) and Olsen (son of Ole/Ola), the three most common surnames in Norway. This also occurs in other cultures: Spanish and Portuguese (López or Lopes, son of Lope; Álvarez or Álvares, son of Álvaro; Domínguez or Domingues, son of Domingo or Domingos; etc.); in English (Johnson, son of John; Richardson, son of Richard), etc.\n\nPatronymic name conventions are similar in some other nations, including Malaysia (see Malaysian name) and other Muslim countries, among most people of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala (unlike another Indian state Andhra Pradesh, where ancestral origin village names have become surnames for the people), in Mongolia and in the Scottish Gaelic personal naming system. In Russia and Bulgaria, both patronymic and family name are obligatory parts of one's full name: e.g. if a Russian is called Ivan Andreyevich Sergeyev, that means that his father's name is Andrey and his family name is Sergeyev. A similar system is used in Greece.\n\nIn Ethiopia and Eritrea, a child adopts the given name of one of their parents, usually the father, as a pseudo-surname. For example, Abraham Mesfin's father's first name would have been Mesfin, while Abraham Mesfin's child might be called \"Netsanet Abraham\". Just as in Iceland, referring to Abraham Mesfin as \"Mr Mesfin\" would be erroneous: the correct term would be \"Mr Abraham\". Very rarely do children adopt their mother's given name, who in any case would retain their \"pseudo-surname\".\n\nAs part of Hebrew patronymic names, Ben is followed by the father's name, e.g. Ben Adam () or Abraham ben Abraham. Bar-, \"son of\" in Aramaic, is used likewise, e.g. Meir Bar-Ilan. Ben (, \"son of\") also forms part of Hebrew names, e.g. Benjamin.\n\nThere is a wide range of family name affixes with a patronymic function. Some are prefixes (e.g., Gaelic \"mac\") but more are suffixes.\n\nOccupational names include such simple examples as \"Smith\" (for a smith), \"Miller\" (for a miller), \"Farmer\" (for tax farmers or sometimes farmers), \"Thatcher\" (for a thatcher), \"Shepherd\" (for a shepherd), \"Potter\" (for a potter), and so on, as well as non-English ones, such as the German \"Eisenhauer\" (iron hewer, later Anglicized in America as \"Eisenhower\") or \"Schneider\" (tailor) – or, as in English, \"Schmidt\" (smith). There are also more complicated names based on occupational titles. In England it was common for servants to take a modified version of their employer's occupation or first name as their last name, adding the letter \"s\" to the word, although this formation could also be a patronymic. For instance, the surname \"Vickers\" is thought to have arisen as an occupational name adopted by the servant of a vicar, while \"Roberts\" could have been adopted by either the son or the servant of a man named Robert. A subset of occupational names in English are names thought to be derived from the medieval mystery plays. The participants would often play the same roles for life, passing the part down to their oldest sons. Names derived from this may include \"King\", \"Lord\" and \"Virgin\". The original meaning of names based on medieval occupations may no longer be obvious in modern English (so the surnames \"Cooper\", \"Chandler\", and \"Cutler\" come from the occupations of making barrels, candles, and cutlery, respectively).\n\n\"Archer\", \"Bailey\", \"Bailhache\", \"Baker\", \"Brewer\", \"Butcher\", \"Carpenter\", \"Carter\", \"Chandler\", \"Clark\" or \"Clarke\", \"Collier\", \"Cooper\", \"Cook\", \"Dempster\", \"Dyer\", \"Farmer\", \"Faulkner\", \"Fisher\", \"Fletcher\", \"Fowler\", \"Fuller\", \"Gardener\", \"Glover\", \"Hayward\", \"Hawkins\", \"Head\", \"Hunt\" or \"Hunter\", \"Judge\", \"Knight\", \"Mason\", \"Miller\", \"Mower\", \"Page\", \"Palmer\", \"Parker\", \"Porter\", \"Potter\", \"Reeve\" or \"Reeves\", \"Sawyer\", \"Slater\", \"Smith\", \"Stringer\", \"Taylor\", \"Thatcher\", \"Turner\", \"Walker\", \"Weaver\", \"Woodman\" and \"Wright\" (or variations such as \"Cartwright\" and \"Wainwright\").\n\nLocation (toponymic, habitation) names derive from the inhabited location associated with the person given that name. Such locations can be any type of settlement, such as: homesteads, farms, enclosures, villages, hamlets, strongholds or cottages. One element of a habitation name may describe the type of settlement. Examples of Old English elements are frequently found in the second element of habitational names. The habitative elements in such names can differ in meaning, according to different periods, different locations, or with being used with certain other elements. For example, the Old English element \"tūn\" may have originally meant \"enclosure\" in one name, but can have meant \"farmstead\", \"village\", \"manor\", or \"estate\" in other names.\n\nLocation names, or habitation names, may be as generic as \"Monte\" (Portuguese for \"mountain\"), \"Górski\" (Polish for \"hill\") or \"Pitt\" (variant of \"pit\"), but may also refer to specific locations. \"Washington,\" for instance, is thought to mean \"the homestead of the family of Wassa\", while \"Lucci\" means \"resident of Lucca\". Although some surnames, such as \"London\", \"Lisboa\" or \"Białystok\" are derived from large cities, more people reflect the names of smaller communities, as in Ó Creachmhaoil, derived from a village in County Galway. This is thought to be due to the tendency in Europe during the Middle Ages for migration to chiefly be from smaller communities to the cities and the need for new arrivals to choose a defining surname.\n\nIn Portuguese-speaking countries, it is uncommon, but not unprecedented, to find surnames derived from names of countries, such as Portugal, França, Brasil, Holanda.\n\nMany Japanese surnames derive from geographical features; for example, Ishikawa (石川) means \"stone river\", Yamamoto (山本) means \"the base of the mountain\", and Inoue (井上) means \"above the well.\"\n\nArabic names sometimes contain surnames that denote the city of origin. For example, in cases of Saddam Hussein al Tikriti, meaning Saddam Hussein originated from Tikrit, a city in Iraq. This component of the name is called a \"nisbah\".\n\nThis is the broadest class of surnames, encompassing many types of origin. These include names, also known as eke-names, based on appearance such as \"Schwartzkopf\", \"Short\", and possibly \"Caesar\", and names based on temperament and personality such as \"Daft\", \"Gutman\", and \"Maiden\", which, according to a number of sources, was an English nickname meaning \"effeminate\".\n\nOrnamental names used as surnames are more common in communities which adopted (or were forced to adopt) surnames in the 18th and 19th centuries. They occur commonly among Jewish families in Germany and in Scandinavia. Examples include \"Morgenstern\" (\"morning star\"), \"Safire\" (\"sapphire\"), and \"Reis\" (\"branch\"). In some cases, such as Chinese Indonesians and Chinese Thais, certain ethnic groups are subject to political pressure to change their surnames, in which case surnames can lose their family-name meaning. For instance, Indonesian business tycoon Liem Swie Liong (林绍良) \"indonesianised\" his name to Sudono Salim. In this case \"Liem\" (林) was rendered by \"Salim\", a name of Arabic origin, while \"Sudono\", a Javanese name with the honorific prefix \"su-\" (of Sanskrit origin), was supposed to be a rendering of \"Swie Liong\".\n\nDuring the era of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade many Africans lost their native names and were forced by their owners to take the owners' surnames and any given name the \"owner\" or slave master desired. In the Americas, the family names of many African-Americans have their origins in slavery (\"i.e.\" slave name). Many of them came to bear the surnames of their former owners. Many freed slaves either created family names themselves or adopted the name of their former master.\n\nIn some cultures, such as Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Slovak, Czech, etc. surnames change form depending on the gender of the bearer. For example, in Greece, if a man called Papadopoulos has a daughter, she will likely be named Papadopoulou (if the couple have decided their offspring will take his surname), since that name has a female version. In Poland, if the husband is named Podwiński, and his wife takes his surname, her last name, and those of their unmarried daughters, would be Podwińska. The sons would be known as Podwiński. In Lithuania, if the husband is named Vilkas, his wife will be named Vilkienė and his daughter will be named Vilkaitė. In Slovakia and Czech Republic alike, if a man is called Novák, the wife adds a feminine suffix \"-ová\" to his surname after the marriage, hence Nováková. The same is true for daughters, who almost always inherit the father's surname with the feminine suffix.\n\nThe meanings of some names are unknown or unclear. The most common European name in this category may be the Irish name Ryan, which means 'little king' in Irish Gaelic. Also, Celtic origin of the name Arthur, meaning 'bear'. Other surnames may have arisen from more than one source: the name De Luca, for instance, likely arose either in or near Lucania or in the family of someone named Lucas or Lucius; in some instances, however, the name may have arisen from Lucca, with the spelling and pronunciation changing over time and with emigration. The same name may appear in different cultures by coincidence or romanization; the surname Lee is used in English culture, but is also a romanization of the Chinese surname \"Li\". Surname origins have been the subject of much folk etymology.\n\nIn French Canada until the 19th century, several families adopted surnames that followed the family name in order to distinguish the various branches of a large family. Such a surname was preceded by the word \"dit\" ('said') and was known as a \"nom-dit\" ('said-name'). (Compare with some Roman naming conventions.) While this tradition is no longer in use, in many cases the \"nom-dit\" has come to replace the original family name. Thus the Bourbeau family has split into Bourbeau dit Verville, Bourbeau dit Lacourse, and Bourbeau dit Beauchesne. In many cases Verville, Lacourse, or Beauchesne has become the new family name. Likewise, the Rivard family has split into the Rivard dit Lavigne, Rivard dit Loranger and Rivard dit Lanoie. The origin of the \"nom-dit\" can vary. Often it denoted a geographical trait of the area where that branch of the family lived: Verville lived towards the city, Beauchesne lived near an oak tree, Larivière near a river, etc. Some of the oldest \"noms-dits\" are derived from the war name of a settler who served in the army or militia: Tranchemontagne ('mountain slasher'), Jolicœur ('braveheart'). Others denote a personal trait: Lacourse might have been a fast runner, Legrand was probably tall, etc.\n\nWhile surnames are usually one word, in some cases a surname comprises more than one word.\n\nIn traditional Spanish culture, and as is still the case in many Spanish-speaking countries, an individual does not have only a single surname. Instead an individual inherits the surnames of all of their ancestors, in particular their father and mother. In practice individuals mostly use only the two surnames of their parents. For instance, Spanish ex-premier José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has José Luis as his given name, Rodríguez, as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and Zapatero as his second (i.e. maternal) surname. But in reality an individual can be referred to by any number of his or her surnames as the occasion may require. For example, Rodríguez Zapatero could also be referred to as\n\nAdditional surnames refer to grandmothers, great-grandmothers, and so forth. The number of surnames a person has is theoretically unlimited though it is rare to use more than a few (and indeed an individual may not know more than a few of his or her ancestors' names).\n\nThis custom is not seen in the Hispanic world as being a true compound surname system \"per se\", since it is widely understood that the first surname denotes one's father's family, and the second surname denotes one's mother's family. So \"Rodríguez Zapatero\" is not considered one surname; it is two distinct surnames. Given that it is not a true compound surname, his children do not inherit the \"compound\" surname \"Rodríguez Zapatero.\" Only the paternal surname of both father and mother are passed on. The father's paternal surname becomes the child's own paternal surname, while the mother's paternal surname becomes the child's second surname (as the child's own maternal surname). Thus, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero would pass on only Rodríguez to his children as their first (i.e. paternal) surname.\n\nAn additional complication is introduced by marriage. Rodríguez Zapatero's wife was born Sonsoles Espinosa Díaz. Under Spanish tradition she is still known by that name, even after marriage. But she may also be known as\n\nThese other forms, particularly the last, are becoming less common as they are increasingly seen as sexist (i.e. that a wife is expected to take her husband's name but not the other way around). Additionally, in Spain and some other countries it is becoming more common, in law and in practice, to allow placing the mother's name before the father's in a child's surname rather than insisting that the privilege belongs exclusively to the father.\n\nBeyond this seemingly \"compound\" surname system in the Hispanic world, there are also true compound surnames in the Spanish-speaking countries. These true compound surnames are passed on and inherited as compounds. For instance, former Chairman of the Supreme Military Junta of Ecuador, General Luis Telmo Paz y Miño Estrella, has Luis as his first given name, Telmo as his middle name, the true compound surname Paz y Miño as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and Estrella as his second (i.e. maternal) surname.\n\nLuis Telmo Paz y Miño Estrella is also known more casually as Luis Paz y Miño, Telmo Paz y Miño, or Luis Telmo Paz y Miño. He would never be regarded as Luis Estrella, Telmo Estrella, or Luis Telmo Estrella, nor as Luis Paz, Telmo Paz, or Luis Telmo Paz. This is because \"Paz\" alone is not his surname (although other people use the \"Paz\" surname on its own).\n\nIn this case, Paz y Miño is in fact the paternal surname, being a true compound surname. His children, therefore, would inherit the compound surname \"Paz y Miño\" as their paternal surname, while Estrella would be lost, since the mother's paternal surname becomes the children's second surname (as their own maternal surname). \"Paz\" alone would not be passed on, nor would \"Miño\" alone.\n\nTo avoid ambiguity, one might often informally see these true compound surnames hyphenated, for instance, as Paz-y-Miño. This is true especially in the English-speaking world, but also sometimes even in the Hispanic world, since to many Hispanics unfamiliar with this and other compound surnames, \"Paz y Miño\" might be inadvertently mistaken as \"Paz\" for the paternal surname and \"Miño\" for the maternal surname. Although Miño did start off as the maternal surname in this compound surname, it was many generations ago, around five centuries, that it became compounded, and henceforth inherited and passed on as a compound.\n\nOther surnames which started off as compounds of two or more surnames, but which merged into one single word, also exist. An example would be the surname Pazmiño, whose members are related to the Paz y Miño, as both descend from the \"Paz Miño\" family of five centuries ago.\n\nÁlava, Spain is known for its incidence of true compound surnames, characterized for having the first portion of the surname as a patronymic, normally a Spanish patronymic (i.e. from the Castilian language) or more unusually a Basque language patronymic, followed by the preposition \"de\", with the second part of the surname being a local toponymic surname from Álava.\n\nCompound surnames in English and several other European cultures feature two (or occasionally more) words, often joined by a hyphen or hyphens. However, it is not unusual for compound surnames to be composed of separate words not linked by a hyphen, for example Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the British Conservative Party, whose surname is \"Duncan Smith\". A surname with the prefix \"Fitz\" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, as in \"Fitz William\", as well as \"FitzWilliam\" or \"Fitzwilliam\".\n\nIrish surnames are the oldest surnames in Europe. The common prefixes \"Ó\" and \"Mac\" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, yielding \"Ó Briain\" or \"Mac Millan\" as well as the anglicized \"O'Brien\" and \"MacMillan\" or \"Macmillan.\"\n\nIn the United States, 1,712 surnames cover 50% of the population, and about 1% of the population has the surname Smith, which is also the most frequent English name and an occupational name (\"metal worker\"), a contraction, for instance, of blacksmith or other metalsmiths. Several American surnames are a result of corruptions or phonetic misappropriations of European surnames, perhaps as a result of the registration process at the immigration entry points. Spellings and pronunciations of names remained fluid in the United States until the Social Security System enforced standardization.\n\nApproximately 70% of Canadians have surnames that are of English, Irish, French, or Scottish derivation.\n\nAccording to some estimates, 85% of China's population shares just 100 surnames. The names Wang (王), Zhang (张) and Li (李) are the most frequent.\n\nIn Spain and in most Spanish-speaking countries, the custom is for people to have two surnames. Usually the first surname comes from the father and the second from the mother, but it could be the other way round. When speaking or in informal situations only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purpose. A child's first surname will usually be their father's first surname, while the child's second surname will usually be the mother's first surname. For example, if José García Torres and María Acosta Gómez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo García Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames.\n\nIn some instances, when an individual's given name and first family name are too common (such as in José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and Mario Vargas Llosa), both family names are used (though not necessarily both given names). A person could even take the maternal name for informal situations instead of the paternal name, for personal preferences or if the maternal name is somehow \"special\" (José Luís Rodríguez Zapatero is known in Spanish as \"José Luis Zapatero\" or just as \"Zapatero\"). In Spain, a new law approved in 1999 allows an adult to change the order of his/her family names, and parents can also change the order of their children's family names if they (and the child, if over 12) agree.\n\nIn Spain, especially Catalonia, the paternal and maternal surnames are often combined using the conjunction \"y\" (\"and\" in Spanish) or \"i\" (\"and\" in Catalan), see for example the economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin or painter Salvador Dalí i Domènech.\n\nIn Spain, a woman does not change her legal surnames when she marries. In some Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, a woman may, on her marriage, drop her mother's surname and add her husband's surname to her father's surname using the preposition \"de\" (\"of\"), \"del\" (\"of the\", when the following word is masculine) or \"de la\" (\"of the\", when the following word is feminine). For example, if \"Clara Reyes Alba\" were to marry \"Alberto Gómez Rodríguez\", the wife could use \"Clara Reyes \"de\" Gómez\" as her name (or \"Clara Reyes Gómez\", or, rarely, \"Clara Gómez Reyes\". She can be addressed as \"Sra. de Gómez\" corresponding to \"Mrs Gómez\"). In some countries, this form may be mainly social and not an official name change, i.e. her name would still legally be her birth name. This custom of adding the husband's surname is slowly fading.\n\nSometimes a father transmits his combined family names, thus creating a new one e.g., the paternal surname of the son of \"Javier\" (given name) \"Reyes\" (paternal family name) \"de la Barrera\" (maternal surname) may become the new paternal surname \"Reyes de la Barrera\". \"De\" is also the nobiliary particle used with Spanish surnames. This can not be chosen by the person, as it is part of the surname, for example \"Puente\" and \"Del Puente\" are not the same surname.\n\nChildren take the surnames of both parents, so if the couple above had two children named \"Andrés\" and \"Ana\", then their names would be \"Andrés Gómez Reyes\" and \"Ana Gómez Reyes\". In Spain, a 1995 reform in the law allows the parents to choose whether the father's or the mother's surname goes first, although this order must be the same for all their children. For instance, the name of the son of the couple in the example above could be either \"Andrés Gómez Reyes\" or \"Andrés Reyes Gómez\". Sometimes, for single mothers or when the father would or could not recognize the child, the mother's surname has been used twice: for example, \"Ana Reyes Reyes\". In Spain, however, children with just one parent receive both surnames of that parent, although the order may also be changed. In 1973 in Chile, the law was changed to avoid stigmatizing illegitimate children with the maternal surname repeated.\n\nSome Hispanic people, after leaving their country, drop their maternal surname, even if not formally, so as to better fit into the non-Hispanic society they live or work in. Dropping the paternal surname is not unusual when it is a very common one. For instance, painter Pablo Ruiz Picasso and Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero are known by their maternal surnames as \"Picasso\" and \"Zapatero\". Similarly, Anglophones with just one surname may be asked to provide a second surname on official documents in Spanish-speaking countries. When none (such as the mother's maiden name) is provided, the last name may simply be repeated.\n\nTraditionally in most countries, and currently in some Spanish-speaking countries, women, upon marrying, keep their own family names. It is considered impolite towards her family for a woman to change her name. The higher class women of Cuba and Spain traditionally never change their names. In certain rare situations, a woman may be addressed with her paternal surname followed by her husband's paternal surname linked with \"de\". For example, a woman named \"Ana García Díaz\", upon marrying \"Juan Guerrero Macías\", could be called \"Ana García de Guerrero\". This custom, begun in medieval times, is decaying and only has legal validity in Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru, Panama, and to a certain extent in Mexico (where it is optional but becoming obsolete), but is frowned upon by people in Spain, Cuba, and elsewhere. In Peru and the Dominican Republic, women normally conserve all family names after getting married. For example, if \"Rosa María Pérez Martínez\" marries \"Juan Martín De la Cruz Gómez\", she will be called \"Rosa María Pérez Martínez de De la Cruz\", and if the husband dies, she will be called \"Rosa María Pérez Martínez Vda. de De la Cruz\" (Vda. being the abbreviation for \"viuda\", \"widow\" in Spanish). The law in Peru changed some years ago, and all married women can keep their maiden last name if they wish with no alteration.\n\nIn some churches, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where the family structure is emphasized, as well as legal marriage, the wife is referred to as \"hermana\" [sister] plus the surname of her husband. And most records of the church follow that structure as well.\n\nA new trend in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names. This is done because American born English-speakers are not aware of the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the individual for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban Álvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban Álvarez Cobos, would become Esteban Álvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names.\n\nIn Spanish villages in Catalonia, Galicia, and Asturias and in Cuba, people are often known by the name of their dwelling or collective family nickname rather than by their surnames. For example, Remei Pujol i Serra who lives at Ca l'Elvira would be referred to as \"Remei de Ca l'Elvira\"; and Adela Barreira López who is part of the \"Provisores\" family would be known as \"Adela dos Provisores\". In the case of Cantabria the family's nickname is used instead of the surname: if one family is known as \"Ñecos\" because of an ancestor who was known as \"Ñecu\", they would be \"José el de Ñecu\" or \"Ana la de Ñecu\" (collective: the Ñeco's). Some common nicknames are \"Rubiu\" (blonde or ginger hair), \"Roju\" (reddish, as referred to ginger hair), \"Chiqui\" (small), \"Jinchu\" (big), and a bunch of names about certain characteristics, family relationship or geographical origin (pasiegu, masoniegu, sobanu, llebaniegu, tresmeranu, pejinu, naveru, merachu, tresneru, troule, mallavia, marotias, llamoso, lipa, ñecu, tarugu, trapajeru, lichón, andarível).\n\nIn the case of Portuguese naming customs, the main surname (the one used in alphasorting, indexing, abbreviations, and greetings), appears last.\n\nEach person usually has two family names: though the law specifies no order, the first one is usually the maternal family name, whereas the last one is commonly the paternal family name. In Portugal, a person's full name has a minimum legal length of two names (one given name and one family name from either parent) and a maximum of six names (two first names and four surnames — he or she may have up to four surnames in any order desired picked up from the total of his/her parents and grandparents' surnames). The use of any surname outside this lot, or of more than six names, is legally possible, but it requires dealing with bureaucracy. Parents or the person him/herself must explain the claims they have to bearing that surname (a family nickname, a rare surname lost in past generations, or any other reason one may find suitable). In Brazil there is no limit of surnames used.\n\nIn general, the traditions followed in countries like Brazil, Portugal and Angola are somewhat different from the ones in Spain. In the Spanish tradition, usually the father's surname comes first, followed by the mother's surname, whereas in Portuguese-speaking countries the father's name is the last, mother's coming first. A woman may adopt her husband's surname(s), but nevertheless she usually keeps her birth names, or at least the last one. Since 1977, a husband can also adopt his wife's surname. When this happens, usually both spouses change their name after marriage.\n\nThe custom of a woman changing her name upon marriage is recent. It spread in the late 19th century in the upper classes, under French influence, and in the 20th century, particularly during the 1930s and 1940, it became socially almost obligatory. Nowadays, fewer women adopt, even officially, their husbands' names, and among those who do so officially, it is quite common not to use it either in their professional or informal life.\n\nFor the children, some bear only the last surnames of the parents. For example, \"Carlos da Silva Gonçalves\" and \"Ana Luísa de Albuquerque Pereira (Gonçalves)\" (in case she adopted her husband's name after marriage) would have a child named \"Lucas Pereira Gonçalves\". However, the child may have any other combination of the parents' surnames, according to euphony, social significance or other reasons.\n\nIn ancient times a patronymic was commonly used — surnames like \"Gonçalves\" (\"son of \"Gonçalo\"\"), \"Fernandes\" (\"son of \"Fernando\"\"), \"Nunes\" (\"son of \"Nuno\"\"), \"Soares\" (\"son of \"Soeiro\"\"), \"Sanches\" (\"son of \"Sancho\"\"), \"Henriques\" (\"son of \"Henrique\"\"), \"Rodrigues\" (\"son of \"Rodrigo\"\") which along with many others are still in regular use as very prevalent family names.\n\nIn Medieval times, Portuguese nobility started to use one of their estates' names or the name of the town or village they ruled as their surname, just after their patronymic. Soeiro Mendes da Maia bore a name \"Soeiro\", a patronymic \"Mendes\" (\"son of Hermenegildo – shortened to Mendo\") and the name of the town he ruled \"Maia\". He was often referred to in 12th-century documents as \"Soeiro Mendes, senhor da Maia\", Soeiro Mendes, lord of Maia. Noblewomen also bore patronymics and surnames in the same manner and never bore their husband's surname. First-born males bore their father's surname, other children bore either both or only one of them at their will.\n\nOnly during the Early Modern Age, lower-class males started to use at least one surname; married lower-class women usually took up their spouse's surname, since they rarely ever used one beforehand. After the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, Portuguese authorities realized the benefits of enforcing the use and registry of surnames. Henceforth, they became mandatory, although the rules for their use were very liberal.\n\nUntil the end of the 19th century it was common for women, especially those from a very poor background, not to have a surname and so to be known only by their first names. A woman would then adopt her husband's full surname after marriage. With the advent of republicanism in Brazil and Portugal, along with the institution of civil registries, all children now have surnames.\nDuring the mid-20th century, under French influence and among upper classes, women started to take up their husbands' surname(s). From the 1960s onwards, this usage spread to the common people, again under French influence, this time, however, due to the forceful legal adoption of their husbands' surname which was imposed onto Portuguese immigrant women in France.\n\nFrom the 1974 Carnation Revolution onwards the adoption of their husbands' surname(s) receded again, and today both the adoption and non-adoption occur, with non-adoption being chosen in the majority of cases in recent years (60%). Also, it is legally possible for the husband to adopt his wife's surname(s), but this practice is rare.\n\nBrazilians usually call people only by their given names, omitting family names, even in many formal situations, as in the press referring to authorities, e.g. \"Former President Fernando Henrique\", never Former President Cardoso, or even \"Former President Lula\" (\"Lula\" is actually his nickname). When formality or a prefix requires a family name, the given name usually precedes the surname, e.g. \"João Santos\", or \"Sr. João Santos\".\n\nThe Assyrian people are a distinct ethnic group, descendant largely from the population of ancient Assyria, indigenous to Mesopotamia with roots in the Middle East, mainly present-day Iraq, northwest Iran, northeast Syria and southeast Turkey.\n\nSurnames come from the Akkadian influenced Eastern Aramaic dialects of the Assyrian (Chaldo-Assyrian) people. Some surnames are connected to East Syriac Rite Christianity, the religion Assyrians currently follow and have followed since the 1st century AD, with others being of distinctly ancient Assyrian/Mesopotamian origin.\n\nCommon surnames include: \"Aboona\", \"Abraham\", \"Abro\", \"Agajan\", \"Agassi\", \"Aghase\", \"Akkad\", \"Akbalit/Akbalut\", \"Alamasha\", \"Alawerdy\", \"Aldawid\", \"Amo Baba\", \"Amu\", \"Antar\", \"Aprim\", \"Apshu\", \"Afarcan\", \"Arad\", \"Ashai\", \"Ashouri\", \"Ashurian\", \"Ashur\", \"Awdishu\", \"Awikam\", \"Awishalim\", \"Awitor\", \"Awia\", \"Awrohum\", \"Aziz\", \"Azzo\", \"Baba\", \"Bacchus\", \"Badel\", \"Barkha/Barkho\", \"Brikha\", \"Bronit\", \"Balou\", \"Barkoo\", \"Benassi\", \"Benyamin\", \"Bidavid\", \"Bidawid\", \"Bishu\", \"Cabani\", \"Dadashu/Dadasho\", \"Darmu\", \"Dinkha\", \"Daoud\", \"Dayan/Daian\", \"Disho\", \"Duman\", \"Elia\", \"Elias\", \"Enwia\", \"Eshai\", \"Farhad\", \"Gorges/Georgis\", \"Gewargis\", \"Hadad/Adad\", \"Hamsho\", \"Hasso\", \"Harshu\", \"Hormis\", \"Hosanna\", \"Hurmis\", \"Ilshu\", \"Ilishu\", \"Ishmael\", \"Ishai\", \"Isaac\", \"Ishaq\", \"Iskhaq\", \"Iwassi\", \"Jabri\", \"Jelu\", \"Jendo\", \"Juna\", \"Kambar\", \"Karam\", \"Karoukian\", \"Kasri\", \"Khamo\", \"Khanbaba\", \"Khanisho/Khnanisu\", \"Khnaninia\", \"Khedroo\", \"Khoshanu\", \"Khoshaba\", \"Malech\", \"Malek\", \"Malka\", \"Malkai\", \"Malick\", \"Mamendo\", \"Matti\", \"Merza\", \"Mikhael/Mikhail\", \"Mnashi\", \"Nisan\", \"Nimrod\", \"Narsai\", \"Ninweh\", \"Nineveh\", \"Nessar\", \"Odah\", \"Odisha\", \"Odisho\", \"Oraham\", \"Oshana\", \"Qateneh\", \"Raaba\", \"Rabi\", \"Rafael\", \"Ramsin/Rumsin\", \"Rassam\", \"Rifkha\", \"Ronay\", \"Samo\", \"Sargis\", \"Sargon\", \"Sarkis\", \"Sarmas\", \"Sayad\", \"Semma\", \"Shabad\", \"Shamash/Shamasha\", \"Shamshi\", \"Sinharib\", \"Sharrukin\", \"Shimun\", \"Shamoon\", \"Shimon\", \"Shimonaya\", \"Shinu\", \"Shinai\", \"Sleman\", \"Shulman\", \"Sliwoo/Sliwa\", \"Tematheus\", \"Thoma\", \"Thomaya\", \"Tamraz\", \"Tiras\", \"Tiyareh/Tyareh\", \"Urshan\", \"Warda\", \"Warad\", \"Yacoub\", \"Yawalaha\", \"Yalda\", \"Yatrin\", \"Yetron\", \"Yelu\", \"Yoel\", \"Yohannan\", \"Yonan\", \"Yonadam\" \"Yoseph\", \"Yoshu\", \"Youkhana\", \"Younan\", \"Yousif\", \"Yukhannan\", \"Zakharia\", \"Zilkha\", \"Zimri\".\n\nIn the case of Circassians, especially Adyges and Kabardians, hereditary surnames have been borne by people for many years.\n\nMost surnames of Adyge origin fall into six types:\n\n\"Shogen\" comes from the Christian era, and \"Yefendi\" and \"Mole\" come from the Muslim era.\n\nCircassian women, even when they marry, do not change their surnames. By keeping their surnames and passing it on to the next generation, children come to distinguish relatives from the maternal side and respect her family as well as those from their father's side.\n\nOn the other hand, children cannot marry someone who bears the same surname as they do, no matter how distantly related.\n\nIn the Circassian tradition, the formula for surnames is patterned to mean \"daughter of ...\"\n\nAbkhaz families follow similar naming patterns reflecting the common roots of the Abkhazian, Adygean and Wubikh peoples.\n\nCircassian family names cannot be derived from women's names or from the name of female ancestors.\n\nJewish names have historically varied, encompassing throughout the centuries several different traditions. The most usual last name for those of the priest tribe is \"Cohen\"/\"Kahen\"/\"Kogan\"/\"Kohen\"/\"Katz\" (a Hebrew acronym of Kohen Tzedek, or righteous Kohen) and for those of the Levites, \"Levi\"/\"Levine\". Those who came from Central or Eastern Europe usually have \"Rosen\"(\"rose\"), \"Spiel\", \"Gold\", and other German words as their names' prefixes, and \"man\", \"wyn\"/\"wein\"(\"wine\"), \"berg\"(\"mountain\"), and other German words as their names' suffixes. Many Sephardic Jews adopted Spanish or Arabic names, like “Toledo”, “Bejarano”, \"Azizi\" (\"you're [someones] love\"), \"Hassan\" or added words to their original names, like Beizaee( \"Iza\", God is perfection), \"Kohenzadeh\" (\"[she] bore a Kohen\"). Names like \"Johnson\" and \"Peterson\" may be used in Jewish tradition as they too used the father's name as identification. So \"Johnson\" in Hebrew is \"Ben Yochanon\", meaning \"Yochanon (John)'s son\".\nAnother common group of Jewish surnames is toponymics, for example \"San'ani\" (from Sana'a in Yemen), \"Varshavski\" (from Warsaw in Poland), \"Yerushalmi\" (from Jerusalem).\n\nJews who immigrated to Israel or Palestine often changed their surnames to Hebrew ones, a process described under Hebraization of surnames.\n\nThe majority of Kurds do not hold Kurdish names because the names have been banned in the countries they primarily live in (namely Iran, Turkey and Syria). Kurds in these respective countries tend to hold Turkish, Persian or Arabic names, in the majority of cases, forcefully appointed by the ruling governments. Others hold Arabic names as a result of the influence of Islam and Arab culture.\n\nKurds holding authentic Kurdish names are generally found in Diaspora or in Iraqi Kurdistan where Kurds are relatively free. Traditionally, Kurdish family names are inherited from the tribes of which the individual or families are members. However, some families inherit the names of the regions they are from.\n\nCommon affixes of authentic Kurdish names are \"-î\" and \"-za\" also \"-a\" and \"-ê\" by two surnames.\ne.g.:\nName+1Surname+2Surname\n\"Male:\"\nBaran of Mem of Alan\n\n\"Female:\"\nBerfin of Sarah of Evin\n\nthere are also names with the word \"Mal(a)\" [House (of)]\ne.g.:\nBaran of House of Alan\nBerfin of House of Evin\n\nSome common Kurdish last names, which are also the names of their respective tribes, include Baradost, Barzani, Berwari, Berzinji, Chelki, Diri, Doski, Jaf, Mutki, Rami, Rekani, Rozaki, Sindi, and Tovi. Other names include Akreyi, Alan, Amedi, Botani, Hewrami, Mukri, and Serhati.\n\nTraditionally, Kurdish women did not inherit a man's last name. Although still not in practice by many Kurds, this can be more commonly found today.\n\nTibetan people are often named at birth by the local Buddhist Lama or they may request a name from the Dalai Lama. The majority do not have family names. They may change their name throughout life if advised by a Buddhist Lama, for example if a different name removes obstacles. Tibetans who enter monastic life take a name from their ordination Lama, which will be a combination of the Lama's name and a new name for them.\nRajputs are an ethnic group in India, spread all over the country and have a rich cultural identity.\n\nThe common surnames include: \"Singh\", \"Chauhan\", \"Rajput\", \"Sinha (or Singha)\", \"Rathore\", \"Roy\" etc.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40626873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40626873", "title": "Technological determinism", "text": "Technological determinism\n\nTechnological determinism is a reductionist theory that assumes that a society's technology determines the development of its social structure and cultural values. Technological determinism tries to understand how technology has had an impact on human action and thought. Changes in technology are the primary source for changes in society. The term is believed to have originated from Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), an American sociologist and economist. The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century was most likely Clarence Ayres who was a follower of Thorstein Veblen and John Dewey. William Ogburn was also known for his radical technological determinism.\n\nThe first major elaboration of a technological determinist view of socioeconomic development came from the German philosopher and economist Karl Marx, whose theoretical framework was grounded in the perspective that changes in technology, and specifically productive technology, are the primary influence on human social relations and organizational structure, and that social relations and cultural practices ultimately revolve around the technological and economic base of a given society. Marx's position has become embedded in contemporary society, where the idea that fast-changing technologies alter human lives is all-pervasive. \nAlthough many authors attribute a technologically determined view of human history to Marx's insights, not all Marxists are technological determinists, and some authors question the extent to which Marx himself was a determinist. Furthermore, there are multiple forms of technological determinism.\n\nThe term is believed to have been coined by Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), an American social scientist. Veblen's contemporary, popular historian Charles A. Beard, provided this apt determinist image, \"Technology marches in seven-league boots from one ruthless, revolutionary conquest to another, tearing down old factories and industries, flinging up new processes with terrifying rapidity.\" As to the meaning, it is described as the ascription to machines of \"powers\" that they do not have. Veblen, for instance, asserted that \"the machine throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought.\" There is also the case of Karl Marx who expected that the construction of the railway in India would dissolve the caste system. The general idea, according to Robert Heilbroner, is that technology, by way of its machines, can cause historical change by changing the material conditions of human existence.\n\nOne of the most radical technological determinists was a man named Clarence Ayres, who was a follower of Veblen's theory in the 20th century. Ayers is best known for developing economic philosophies, but he also worked closely with Veblen who coined the technological determinism theory. He often times talked about the struggle between technology and ceremonial structure. One of his most notable theories involved the concept of \"technological drag\" where he explains technology as a self-generating process and institutions as ceremonial and this notion creates a technological over-determinism in the process. \n\nTechnological determinism seeks to show technical developments, media, or technology as a whole, as the key mover in history and social change. It is a theory subscribed by \"hyperglobalist\" who claims that as a consequence of the wide availability of technology, accelerated globalization is inevitable. Therefore, technological development and innovation become the principal motor of social, economic or political change.\n\nStrict adherents to technological determinism do not believe the influence of technology differs based on how much a technology is or can be used. Instead of considering technology as part of a larger spectrum of human activity, technological determinism sees technology as the basis for all human activity.\n\nTechnological determinism has been summarized as 'The belief in technology as a key governing force in society ...' (Merritt Roe Smith). 'The idea that technological development determines social change ...' (Bruce Bimber). It changes the way people think and how they interact with others and can be described as '...a three-word logical proposition: \"Technology determines history\"' (Rosalind Williams) . It is, '... the belief that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an \"inevitable\" course.' (Michael L. Smith). This 'idea of progress' or 'doctrine of progress' is centralised around the idea that social problems can be solved by technological advancement, and this is the way that society moves forward. Technological determinists believe that \"'You can't stop progress', implying that we are unable to control technology\" (Lelia Green). This suggests that we are somewhat powerless and society allows technology to drive social changes because, \"societies fail to be aware of the alternatives to the values embedded in it [technology]\" (Merritt Roe Smith).\n\nTechnological determinism has been defined as an approach that identifies technology, or technological advances, as the central causal element in processes of social change (Croteau and Hoynes). As a technology is stabilized, its design tends to dictate users' behaviors, consequently diminishing human agency. This stance however ignores the social and cultural circumstances in which the technology was developed. Sociologist Claude Fischer (1992) characterized the most prominent forms of technological determinism as \"billiard ball\" approaches, in which technology is seen as an external force introduced into a social situation, producing a series of ricochet effects.\n\nRather than acknowledging that a society or culture interacts with and even shapes the technologies that are used, a technological determinist view holds that \"the uses made of technology are largely determined by the structure of the technology itself, that is, that its functions follow from its form\" (Neil Postman). However, this is not to be confused with Daniel Chandler's \"inevitability thesis\", which states that once a technology is introduced into a culture that what follows is the inevitable development of that technology.\n\nFor example, we could examine why Romance Novels have become so dominant in our society compared to other forms of novels like the Detective or Western novel. We might say that it was because of the invention of the perfect binding system developed by publishers. This was where glue was used instead of the time-consuming and very costly process of binding books by sewing in separate signatures. This meant that these books could be mass-produced for the wider public. We would not be able to have mass literacy without mass production. This example is closely related to Marshall McLuhan's belief that print helped produce the nation state. This moved society on from an oral culture to a literate culture but also introduced a capitalist society where there was clear class distinction and individualism. As Postman maintains \n\nThe printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information.\n\nIn examining determinism, hard determinism can be contrasted with soft determinism. A compatibilist says that it is possible for free will and determinism to exist in the world together, while an incompatibilist would say that they can not and there must be one or the other. Those who support determinism can be further divided.\n\nHard determinists would view technology as developing independent from social concerns. They would say that technology creates a set of powerful forces acting to regulate our social activity and its meaning. According to this view of determinism we organize ourselves to meet the needs of technology and the outcome of this organization is beyond our control or we do not have the freedom to make a choice regarding the outcome (autonomous technology). The 20th century French philosopher and social theorist Jacques Ellul could be said to be a hard determinist and proponent of autonomous technique (technology). In his 1954 work \"\", Ellul essentially posits that technology, by virtue of its power through efficiency, determines which social aspects are best suited for its own development through a process of natural selection. A social system's values, morals, philosophy etc. that are most conducive to the advancement of technology allow that social system to enhance its power and spread at the expense of those social systems whose values, morals, philosophy etc. are less promoting of technology. Theodore J. Kaczynski (the Unabomber) can be essentially thought of as a hard determinist. According to Kaczynski, \"objective\" material factors in the human environment are the principal determining factors in the evolution of social systems. While geography, climate, and other \"natural\" factors largely determined the parameters of social conditions for most of human history, technology has recently become the dominant objective factor (largely due to forces unleashed by the industrial revolution) and it has been the principal objective and determining factor.\n\nSoft determinism, as the name suggests, is a more passive view of the way technology interacts with socio-political situations. Soft determinists still subscribe to the fact that technology is the guiding force in our evolution, but would maintain that we have a \"chance\" to make decisions regarding the outcomes of a situation. This is not to say that free will exists, but that the possibility for us to \"roll the dice\" and see what the outcome is exists. A slightly different variant of soft determinism is the 1922 technology-driven theory of social change proposed by William Fielding Ogburn, in which society must adjust to the consequences of major inventions, but often does so only after a period of cultural lag.\n\nIndividuals who consider technology as neutral see technology as neither good nor bad and what matters are the ways in which we use technology. An example of a neutral viewpoint is, \"guns are neutral and its up to how we use them whether it would be 'good or bad'\" (Green, 2001). Mackenzie and Wajcman believe that technology is neutral only if it's never been used before, or if no one knows what it is going to be used for (Green, 2001). In effect, guns would be classified as neutral if and only if society were none the wiser of their existence and functionality (Green, 2001). Obviously, such a society is non-existent and once becoming knowledgeable about technology, the society is drawn into a social progression where nothing is 'neutral about society' (Green). According to Lelia Green, if one believes technology is neutral, one would disregard the cultural and social conditions that technology has produced (Green, 2001). This view is also referred to as technological instrumentalism.\n\nIn what is often considered a definitive reflection on the topic, the historian Melvin Kranzberg famously wrote in the first of his six laws of technology: \"Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\"\n\nScepticism about technological determinism emerged alongside increased pessimism about techno-science in the mid-20th century, in particular around the use of nuclear energy in the production of nuclear weapons, Nazi human experimentation during World War II, and the problems of economic development in the Third World. As a direct consequence, desire for greater control of the course of development of technology gave rise to disenchantment with the model of technological determinism in academia.\n\nModern theorists of technology and society no longer consider technological determinism to be a very accurate view of the way in which we interact with technology, even though determinist assumptions and language fairly saturate the writings of many boosters of technology, the business pages of many popular magazines, and much reporting on technology . Instead, research in science and technology studies, social construction of technology and related fields have emphasised more nuanced views that resist easy causal formulations. They emphasise that \"The relationship between technology and society cannot be reduced to a simplistic cause-and-effect formula. It is, rather, an 'intertwining'\", whereby technology does not determine but \"operates, and are operated upon in a complex social field\" (Murphie and Potts).\n\nIn his article \"Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with Technology,\" Andrew Feenberg argues that technological determinism is not a very well founded concept by illustrating that two of the founding theses of determinism are easily questionable and in doing so calls for what he calls democratic rationalization (Feenberg 210–212).\n\nProminent opposition to technologically determinist thinking has emerged within work on the social construction of technology (SCOT). SCOT research, such as that of Mackenzie and Wajcman (1997) argues that the path of innovation and its social consequences are strongly, if not entirely shaped by society itself through the influence of culture, politics, economic arrangements, regulatory mechanisms and the like. In its strongest form, verging on social determinism, \"What matters is not the technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is embedded\" (Langdon Winner).\n\nIn his influential but contested (see Woolgar and Cooper, 1999) article \"Do Artifacts Have Politics?\", Langdon Winner illustrates not a form of determinism but the various sources of the politics of technologies. Those politics can stem from the intentions of the designer and the culture of the society in which a technology emerges or can stem from the technology itself, a \"practical necessity\" for it to function. For instance, New York City urban planner Robert Moses is purported to have built Long Island's parkway tunnels too low for buses to pass in order to keep minorities away from the island's beaches, an example of externally inscribed politics. On the other hand, an authoritarian command-and-control structure is a practical necessity of a nuclear power plant if radioactive waste is not to fall into the wrong hands. As such, Winner neither succumbs to technological determinism nor social determinism. The source of a technology's politics is determined only by carefully examining its features and history.\n\nAlthough \"The deterministic model of technology is widely propagated in society\" (Sarah Miller), it has also been widely questioned by scholars. Lelia Green explains that, \"When technology was perceived as being outside society, it made sense to talk about technology as neutral\". Yet, this idea fails to take into account that culture is not fixed and society is dynamic. When \"Technology is implicated in social processes, there is nothing neutral about society\" (Lelia Green). This confirms one of the major problems with \"technological determinism and the resulting denial of human responsibility for change. There is a loss of human involvement that shape technology and society\" (Sarah Miller).\n\nAnother conflicting idea is that of technological somnambulism, a term coined by Winner in his essay \"Technology as Forms of Life\". Winner wonders whether or not we are simply \"sleepwalking\" through our existence with little concern or knowledge as to how we truly interact with technology. In this view, it is still possible for us to wake up and once again take control of the direction in which we are traveling (Winner 104). However, it requires society to adopt Ralph Schroeder's claim that, \"users don't just passively consume technology, but actively transform it\".\n\nIn opposition to technological determinism are those who subscribe to the belief of social determinism and postmodernism. Social determinists believe that social circumstances alone select which technologies are adopted, with the result that no technology can be considered \"inevitable\" solely on its own merits. Technology and culture are not neutral and when knowledge comes into the equation, technology becomes implicated in social processes. The knowledge of how to create and enhance technology, and of how to use technology is socially bound knowledge. Postmodernists take another view, suggesting that what is right or wrong is dependent on circumstance. They believe technological change can have implications on the past, present and future. While they believe technological change is influenced by changes in government policy, society and culture, they consider the notion of change to be a paradox, since change is constant.\n\nMedia and cultural studies theorist Brian Winston, in response to technological determinism, developed a model for the emergence of new technologies which is centered on the Law of the suppression of radical potential. In two of his books – \"Technologies of Seeing: Photography, Cinematography and Television\" (1997) and \"Media Technology and Society\" (1998) – Winston applied this model to show how technologies evolve over time, and how their 'invention' is mediated and controlled by society and societal factors which suppress the radical potential of a given technology.\n\nOne continued argument for technological determinism is centered on the stirrup and its impact on the creation of feudalism in Europe in the late 8th century/early 9th century. Lynn White is credited with first drawing this parallel between feudalism and the stirrup in his book \"Medieval Technology and Social Change\", stating that as \"it made possible mounted shock combat\", the new form of war made the soldier that much more efficient in supporting feudal townships (White, 2). According to White, the superiority of the stirrup in combat was found in the mechanics of the lance charge: \"The stirrup made possible- though it did not demand- a vastly more effective mode of attack: now the rider could law his lance at rest, held between the upper arm and the body, and make at his foe, delivering the blow not with his muscles but with the combined weight of himself and his charging stallion (White, 2).\" White draws from a large research base, particularly Heinrich Brunner's \"Der Reiterdienst und die Anfänge des Lehnwesens\" in substantiating his claim of the emergence of feudalism. In focusing on the evolution of warfare, particularly that of cavalry in connection with Charles Martel's \"diversion of a considerable part of the Church's vast military riches...from infantry to cavalry\", White draws from Brunner's research and identifies the stirrup as the underlying cause for such a shift in military division and the subsequent emergence of feudalism (White, 4). Under the new brand of warfare garnered from the stirrup, White implicitly argues in favor of technological determinism as the vehicle by which feudalism was created.\n\nThough an accomplished work, White's \"Medieval Technology and Social Change\" has since come under heavy scrutiny and condemnation. The most volatile critics of White's argument at the time of its publication, P.H. Sawyer and R.H. Hilton, call the work as a whole \"a misleading adventurist cast to old-fashioned platitudes with a chain of obscure and dubious deductions from scanty evidence about the progress of technology (Sawyer and Hilton, 90).\" They further condemn his methods and, by association, the validity of technological determinism: \"Had Mr. White been prepared to accept the view that the English and Norman methods of fighting were not so very different in the eleventh century, he would have made the weakness of his argument less obvious, but the fundamental failure would remain: the stirrup cannot alone explain the changes it made possible (Sawyer and Hilton, 91).\" For Sawyer and Hilton, though the stirrup may be useful in the implementation of feudalism, it cannot be credited for the creation of feudalism alone.\n\nDespite the scathing review of White's claims, the technological determinist aspect of the stirrup is still in debate. Alex Roland, author of \"Once More into the Stirrups; Lynne White Jr, Medieval Technology and Social Change\", provides an intermediary stance: not necessarily lauding White's claims, but providing a little defense against Sawyer and Hilton's allegations of gross intellectual negligence. Roland views White's focus on technology to be the most relevant and important aspect of \"Medieval Technology and Social Change\" rather than the particulars of its execution: \"But can these many virtues, can this utility for historians of technology, outweigh the most fundamental standards of the profession? Can historians of technology continue to read and assign a book that is, in the words of a recent critic, \"shot through with over-simplification, with a progression of false connexions between cause and effect, and with evidence presented selectively to fit with [White's] own pre-conceived ideas\"? The answer, I think, is yes, at least a qualified yes (Roland, 574-575).\" Objectively, Roland claims \"Medieval Technology and Social Change\" a variable success, at least as \"Most of White's argument stands... the rest has sparked useful lines of research (Roland, 584).\" This acceptance of technological determinism is ambiguous at best, neither fully supporting the theory at large nor denouncing it, rather placing the construct firmly in the realm of the theoretical. Roland neither views technological determinism as completely dominant over history nor completely absent as well; in accordance with the above criterion of technological determinist structure, would Roland be classified as a \"soft determinist\".\n\nThomas L. Friedman, American journalist, columnist and author, admits to being a technological determinist in his book \"The World is Flat\".\n\nFuturist Raymond Kurzweil's theories about a technological singularity follow a technologically deterministic view of history.\n\nSome interpret Karl Marx as advocating technological determinism, with such statements as \"The Handmill gives you society with the feudal lord: the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist\" (\"The Poverty of Philosophy,\" 1847), but others argue that Marx was not a determinist.\n\nTechnological determinist Walter Ong reviews the societal transition from an oral culture to a written culture in his work \"Orality and Literacy.\" He asserts that this particular development is attributable to the use of new technologies of literacy (particularly print and writing,) to communicate thoughts which could previously only be verbalized. He furthers this argument by claiming that writing is purely context dependent as it is a \"secondary modelling system\" (8). Reliant upon the earlier primary system of spoken language, writing manipulates the potential of language as it depends purely upon the visual sense to communicate the intended information. Furthermore, the rather stagnant technology of literacy distinctly limits the usage and influence of knowledge, it unquestionably effects the evolution of society. In fact, Ong asserts that \"more than any other single invention, writing has transformed human consciousness\" (Ong 1982: 78).\n\nMedia determinism is a form of technological determinism, a philosophical and sociological position which posits the power of the media to impact society. Two foundational media determinists are the Canadian scholars Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan. One of the best examples of technological determinism in media theory is Marshall McLuhan's theory \"the medium is the message\" and the ideas of his mentor Harold Adams Innis. Both these Canadian theorists saw media as the essence of civilization. The association of different media with particular mental consequences by McLuhan and others can be seen as related to technological determinism. It is this variety of determinism that is referred to as media determinism. According to McLuhan, there is an association between communications media/technology and language; similarly, Benjamin Lee Whorf argues that language shapes our perception of thinking (linguistic determinism). For McLuhan, media is a more powerful and explicit determinant than is the more general concept of language. McLuhan was not necessarily a hard determinist. As a more moderate version of media determinism, he proposed that our use of particular media may have subtle influences on us, but more importantly, it is the social context of use that is crucial. See also Media ecology.\nMedia determinism is a form of the popular dominant theory of the relationship between technology and society. In a determinist view, technology takes on an active life of its own and is seen be as a driver of social phenomena. Innis believed that the social, cultural, political, and economic developments of each historical period can be related directly to the technology of the means of mass communication of that period. In this sense, like Dr. Frankenstein's monster, technology itself appears to be alive, or at least capable of shaping human behavior. However, it has been increasingly subject to critical review by scholars. For example, scholar Raymond Williams, criticizes media determinism and rather believes social movements define technological and media processes. With regard to communications media, audience determinism is a viewpoint opposed to media determinism. This is described as instead of media being presented as doing things to people; the stress is on the way people do things with media. Individuals need to be aware that the term \"deterministic\" is a negative one for many social scientists and modern sociologists; in particular they often use the word as a term of abuse.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15340084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15340084", "title": "Time formatting and storage bugs", "text": "Time formatting and storage bugs\n\nIn computer science, time formatting and storage bugs are a class of software bugs which may cause time and date calculation or display to be improperly handled. These are most commonly manifestations of arithmetic overflow, but can also be the result of other issues. The most well-known consequence of bugs of this type is the Y2K problem, but many other milestone dates or times exist that have caused or will cause problems depending on various programming deficiencies.\n\nDuring the 1960s, some computer programs were written using just a single digit for the year, so that 0–9 represented the years 1960–1969. It was especially easy to write programs in the COBOL language with this limitation. The problem was identified and corrected before 1970. No consequences due to this problem are known to have occurred. The fix generally was to expand the year to just two digits, owing to limitations of the storage media common in that era, tab cards and magnetic tape.\n\nOn 4 January 1975, the 12-bit field that had been used for dates in the Decsystem 10 operating systems overflowed. There were numerous problems and crashes related to this bug while an alternative format was developed.\n\nSome mainframe programs were written to encode dates as the number of days since a 'zero date' of 1 January 1900, storing them as signed 16-bit binary integers. On 18 September 1989, these programs began to fail, the date being exactly 32,768 (2) days since the zero date. Values on and after this day do not fit into a signed 16-bit integer, but overflow and return negative values.\n\nThe Domain/OS clock, which is based on the number of 4-microsecond units that has occurred since 1 January 1980, rolled past 47 bits on 2 November 1997, rendering unpatched systems unusable.\n\nIn the last few months before the year 2000, two other date-related milestones occurred that received less publicity than the then-impending Y2K problem.\n\nIn many programs or data sets, \"9/9/99\" was used as a rogue value to indicate either an unresolved date or as a terminator to indicate no further data was in the set. This raised issues upon the arrival of the actual date this represents, 9 September 1999.\nThe other problem was related to GPS devices: GPS dates are expressed as a week number and a day-of-week number, with the week number transmitted as a ten-bit value. This means that every 1024 weeks (about 19.6 years) after Sunday 6 January 1980 (the GPS epoch), the date resets again to that date; this happened for the first time on Sunday 22 August 1999 and will happen again on 7 April 2019 and 21 November 2038. To address this concern, modernised GPS navigation messages use a 13-bit field, which only repeats every 8,192 weeks (157 years), and will not return to zero until near the year 2137.\n\nFollow-on problems caused by certain temporary fixes to the Y2K problem will crop up at various points in the 21st century. Some programs were made Y2K-compliant by continuing to use two digit years, but picking an arbitrary year prior to which those years are interpreted as 20\"xx\", and after which are interpreted as 19\"xx\".\n\nFor example, a program may have been changed so that it treats two-digit year values 00–68 as referring to 2000 through 2068, and values 69–99 as referring to 1969 through 1999. Such a program will not be able to correctly deal with years beyond 2068.\n\nFor applications required to calculate the birth year (or another past year), such an algorithm has long been used to overcome the Year 1900 problem, but it has failed to recognise people over 100 years old.\n\nThe SPD EEPROM on modern computer memory modules contains a single-byte binary-coded decimal (two digit) year-of-manufacture code at offset +93 (0x5D). Due to the 18–24 month generational cycle in computer technology this should not be a problem.\n\nSome systems had problems once the year rolled over to 2010. This was dubbed by some in the media as the \"Y2K+10\" or \"Y2.01k\" problem.\n\nThe main source of problems was confusion between hexadecimal number encoding and BCD encodings of numbers. The numbers 0 through 9 are encoded in both hexadecimal and BCD as 00 through 09. But the decimal number 10 is encoded in hexadecimal as 0A and in BCD as 10. Thus a BCD 10 interpreted as a hexadecimal encoding erroneously represents the decimal number 16.\n\nFor example, the SMS protocol uses BCD encoding for dates, so some mobile phone software incorrectly reported dates of messages as 2016 instead of 2010. Windows Mobile was the first software reported to have been affected by this glitch; in some cases WM6 changed the date of any incoming SMS message sent after 1 January 2010 from the year 2010 to 2016.\n\nOther systems affected include EFTPOS terminals, and the PlayStation 3 (except the Slim model).\n\nThe most important such glitch occurred in Germany, where upwards of 20 million bank cards became unusable, and with Citibank Belgium, whose digipass customer identification chips stopped working.\n\nTaiwan officially uses the Minguo calendar, which considers the Gregorian year 1912 to be its year 1. Thus, the Gregorian year 2011 is the ROC year 100, its first 3-digit year.\n\nThe unmanned Deep Impact spaceprobe lost communication with Earth on 11 August 2013, after a clock counted 2 deciseconds (tenths of seconds) since 1 January 2000.\n\nMany Apple iOS devices with the Clock application running crashed at 00:00:00 on 1 January 2014.\n\nSeveral older Samsung mobile phones with Agere chipsets (such as Samsung SGH-C170) would refuse to change dates beyond 31 December 2014; the date would automatically change to 2015, but would revert to the base date in the event of a power cycle (loss of battery power). The workaround is to use the year 1987 in lieu of 2015 as compatible with the leap year cycle to display the correct day of the week, date and month on the main screen.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, on Data General Nova and Eclipse systems, World Computer Corporation (doing credit union applications) created this date format;\n\n16 bit date field:\n\n\n\n\nDates were directly comparable using unsigned functions.\n\nNo known instances of this format are in use today.\n\nThe Network Time Protocol has an overflow issue related to the Year 2038 problem, which manifests itself in 2036, rather than 2038. The 64-bit timestamps used by NTP consist of a 32-bit part for seconds and a 32-bit part for fractional second, giving NTP a time scale that rolls over every 2 seconds (136 years) and a theoretical resolution of 2 second (233 picoseconds). NTP uses an epoch of 1 January 1900. The first rollover occurs in 2036, prior to the UNIX year 2038 problem.\n\nThe original implementation of the Unix operating system stored system time as a 32-bit signed integer representing the number of seconds past the Unix epoch: midnight UTC, 1 January 1970. This value will roll over on 19 January 2038. This problem has been addressed in most modern Unix and Unix-like operating systems by storing system time as a 64-bit signed integer, although individual applications, protocols, and file formats will still need to be changed as well.\n\nThe Digital Video Broadcast system has an issue on 22 April 2038, when the 16 bits used to transmit Modified Julian Days used for electronic guide scheduling will restart from zero. The ETSI EN 300 368 specification mentions in Annex C that the provided MJD formulas are valid until 28 February 2100, but makes no mention of the limits imposed by the 16 bits used to transmit the resulting value.\n\nEarly Apple Macintosh computers store time in their real-time clocks (RTCs) and HFS filesystems as an unsigned 32-bit number of seconds since 00:00:00 on 1 January 1904. After 06:28:15 on 6 February 2040, this will wrap around to 1904. HFS+, the default format for all of Apple's recent Macintosh computers, is also affected. The replacement Apple File System resolves this issue.\n\nCurrently a widely used Apple Quicktime MOV media container has atoms with creation and modification time stored in the same format.\n\nOn 17 September 2042, at 23:53:57.370496 TAI, the Time of Day Clock (TODC) on the S/370 IBM mainframe and its successors, including the current zSeries, will roll over. The UTC time will be a few seconds earlier, due to leap seconds.\n\nThe TODC is implemented as a 64-bit count of 2 microsecond (0.244 ns) units, and the standard base is 1 January 1900. The actual resolution depends on the model, but the format is consistent, and will, therefore, roll over after 2 microseconds. Note that IBM time base is exactly 10 seconds off TAI (it was originally defined in UTC, when that was the offset from TAI).\n\nThe TODC value is accessible to user mode programs and is often used for timing and for generating unique IDs for events.\n\nWhile IBM has defined and implemented a longer (128-bit) hardware format on recent machines, which extends the timer on both ends by at least 8 additional bits, many programs continue to rely on the 64-bit format which remains as an accessible subset of the longer timer.\n\nThe ATSC system will have an issue similar to the DVB issue described above after 2048 due to its use of signed 32-bit GPS seconds that begin from 6 January 1980.\n\nThe capacity planning logic in the ERP system SAP S/4HANA supports only finish dates up to 19 January 2048 (24855 days from 1 January 1980). This concerns e.g. the production, maintenance and inspection planning.\n\nVarious Texas Instruments calculators of the TI BA II Plus, TI BA II Plus Professional, TI-83, TI-84 and NSpire families support a function named dbd to calculate the number of days between dates. This function accepts dates between 1950-01-01 and 2049-12-31 only. One potential area where this will start causing problems in 2020 is in the calculation of 30-year mortgages.\n\nPrograms that store dates as the number of days since an arbitrary date (or \"epoch\") are vulnerable to roll-over or wrap-around effects if the values are not wide enough to allow the date values to span a large enough time range expected for the application. Signed 16-bit binary values roll over after 32,768 (2) days from the epoch date, producing negative values. Some mainframe systems experienced software failures because they had encoded dates as the number of days since 1 January 1900, which produced unexpected negative day numbers on the roll-over date of 18 September 1989. Similarly, unsigned 16-bit binary days counts overflow after 65,536 (2) days, which are truncated to zero values. For software using an epoch of 1 January 1900, this will occur on 6 June 2079.\n\nSome (if not all) Nokia phones that run Series 40 (such as the Nokia X2-00) only supports dates up to 2079-12-31 and will refuse to change dates further than 2079-12-31. The workaround is to use the year 1996 in lieu of 2080 as a compatible leap year to display the correct day of the week, date and month on the main screen.\n\nSystems storing the year as a two-digit value 00..99 internally only (like many RTCs) may rollover from 2079-12-31 to the IBM PC and DOS epoch of 1980-01-01.\n\nDOS and Windows file date API and conversion functions (such as INT 21h/AH=2Ah) officially support dates up to 2099-12-31 only (even though the underlying FAT filesystem would theoretically support dates up to 2107). Hence, DOS-based operating systems as well as applications that convert other formats to the FAT/DOS format, may show unexpected behavior starting 2100-01-01.\n\nAnother problem will emerge at the end of 2100-02-28, since 2100 is not a leap year, whereas many common implementations of the leap year algorithm are incomplete or simplified, and thus will erroneously assume it to be a leap year. This would cause the date to incorrectly roll over from 2100-02-28 to 2100-02-29, instead of directly to 2100-03-01.\n\nMany existing file formats, communications protocols, and application interfaces employ a variant of the Unix date format, storing the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (midnight UTC, 1 January 1970) as an \"unsigned\" 32-bit binary integer. This value will roll over on 7 February 2106. (This storage representation problem is independent of programs that internally store and operate on system times as 64-bit signed integer values.)\n\nThe date timestamps stored in FAT filesystems, originally introduced with 86-DOS 0.42 in 1981 and carried over into MS-DOS, PC DOS, DR-DOS etc., will overflow at the end of 2107-12-31. The last modification date stamp (and with DELWATCH 2.0+ also the file deletion date stamp, and since DOS 7.0+ optionally also the last access date stamp and creation date stamp), are stored in the directory entry with the year represented as an unsigned seven bit number (0–127), relative to 1980, and thereby unable to indicate any dates in the year 2108 and beyond. The API functions defined to retrieve these dates officially only support dates up to 2099-12-31.\n\nThe Go programming language has a API that counts nanoseconds since 1970 as a 64-bit signed integer. This value will overflow on 2262-04-11.\n\nThe year 10,000 will be the first Gregorian year with five digits. Although many people at first consider this year to be so far distant that a problem of this type will never actually occur, certain classes of calculations in disciplines such as astronomy and physics already need to work with years of this magnitude and greater. These applications also have to deal with the Year zero problem. All future powers of 10 years have the potential for similar problems.\n\nPrograms that process years as 16-bit values may encounter problems dealing with either the year 32,768 or 65,536, depending on whether the value is treated as a signed or unsigned integer.\n\nIn the case of the year 32,768 problem, years after 32,767 may be interpreted as negative numbers, beginning with −32,768. The year 65,536 problem is more likely to manifest itself by representing the year 65,536 as the year 0.\n\nCertain problematic years occur so far in the future, well beyond the likely lifespan of the Earth, the Sun, humanity, and even past some predictions of the lifetime of the universe, that they are mainly referenced as matters of theoretical interest, jokes, or indications that a related problem is not truly solved for any reasonable definition of \"solved\".\n\n\nNote: these year values are based on an average year of exactly 365.2425 days, which matches the 4/100/400 leap year rules of the commonly used Gregorian calendar. Additional adjustments to the calendar over intervals this long are unavoidable, as the actual year is currently slightly shorter (about 365.242374 days) than assumed, the length of Earth's orbit around the Sun changes over time (tropical years are currently becoming shorter at a rate of about 0.53 seconds per century), and in any case, all of these times far exceed the likely existence of the Earth. So the year numbers should be considered approximate.\n\nTime zones and Daylight saving time can cause trouble in computer applications. For example:\n\n"}

The original appointed commanding officer was Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones. Funding for the original expedition was requested by President John Quincy Adams in 1828, however, Congress would not implement funding until eight years later. In May 1836, the oceanic exploration voyage was finally authorized by Congress and created by President Andrew Jackson.\n\nThe expedition is sometimes called the \"U.S. Ex. Ex.\" for short, or the \"Wilkes Expedition\" in honor of its next appointed commanding officer, United States Navy Lieutenant Charles Wilkes. The expedition was of major importance to the growth of science in the United States, in particular the then-young field of oceanography. During the event, armed conflict between Pacific islanders and the expedition was common and dozens of natives were killed in action, as well as a few Americans.\n\nThrough the lobbying efforts of Jeremiah N. Reynolds, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution on May 21, 1828, requesting President John Quincy Adams to send a ship to explore the Pacific. Adams was keen on the resolution and ordered his Secretary of the Navy to ready a ship, the \"Peacock\", while the House voted an appropriation in December Yet, the bill stalled in the US Senate in February 1829. However, under President Andrew Jackson, Congress passed legislation in 1836 approving the exploration mission. Yet again, the effort stalled under Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson until President Van Buren assumed office and pushed the effort forward.\n\nOriginally, the expedition was under the command Commodore Jones, but he resigned in November 1837, frustrated with all of the procrastination. Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett, in April 1838, then assigned command to Wilkes, after more senior officers refused the command. Wilkes had a reputation for hydrography, geodesy, and magnetism. Additionally, Wilkes had received mathematics training from Nathaniel Bowditch, triangulation methods from Ferdinand Hassler, and geomagnetism from James Renwick.\n\nPersonnel included naturalists, botanists, a mineralogist, a taxidermist, and a philologist. They were carried aboard the sloops-of-war (780 tons), and (650 tons), the brig (230 tons), the full-rigged ship \"Relief\", which served as a store-ship, and two schooners, \"Sea Gull\" (110 tons) and (96 tons), which served as tenders.\n\nOn the afternoon of August 18, 1838, the vessels weighed anchor and set to sea under full sail. By 0730 the next morning, they had passed the lightship off Willoughby Spit and discharged the pilot. The fleet then headed to Madeira, taking advantage of the prevailing winds.\n\nCoincidentally, Commodore George C. Read in command of the East India Squadron aboard the flagship frigate USS \"Columbia\", together with the frigate USS \"John Adams\", were at the time in the process of circumnavigating the globe when the ships paused for the second Sumatran punitive expedition, which required no detour.\n\nThe expedition consisted of a great many people, a lot of whom were not assigned to any specific vessel. Others served on more than one vessel.\n\nShips\n\nCommand\n\nNaval officers\n\nScientific corps\n\nWilkes was to search for vigias, or shoals, as reported by John Purdy, but failed to corroborate those claims for the locations given. The squadron arrived in the Madeira Islands on September 16, 1838, and Porto Praya on October 6. The \"Peacock\" arrived at Rio de Janeiro on November 21, and the \"Vincennes\" with brigs and schooners on November 24. However, the \"Relief\" did not arrive until the November 27, setting a record for slowness, 100 days. While there, they used Enxados Island in Guanabara Bay for an observatory and naval yard for repair and refitting.\nThe Squadron did not leave Rio de Janeiro until January 6, 1839, arriving at the mouth of the Río Negro on January 25. On February 19, the squadron joined the \"Relief\", \"Flying Fish\", and \"Sea Gull\" in Orange Harbor, Hoste Island, after passing through Le Maire Strait. While there, the expedition came in contact with the Fuegians. Wilkes sent an expedition south in an attempt to exceed Captain Cook's farthest point south, 71°10'.\n\nThe \"Flying Fish\" reached 70° on March 22, in the area about 100 miles north of Thurston Island, and what is now called Cape Flying Fish, and the Walker Mountains. The squadron joined the \"Peacock\" in Valparaiso on May 10, but the \"Sea Gull\" was reported missing. On June 6, the squadron arrived San Lorenzo, off Callao for repair and provisioning, while Wilkes dispatched the \"Relief\" homewards on June 21. Leaving South America on July 12, the expedition reached Reao of the Tuamotu Group on August 13, and Tahiti on September 11. They departed Tahiti on October 10.\n\nThe expedition then visited Samoa and New South Wales, Australia. In December 1839, the expedition sailed from Sydney into the Antarctic Ocean and reported the discovery of the Antarctic continent on January 16, 1840, when Henry Eld and William Reynolds aboard the \"Peacock\" sighted Eld Peak and Reynolds Peak along the George V Coast. On the January 19, Reynolds spotted Cape Hudson. On January 25, the \"Vincennes\" sighted the mountains behind the Cook Ice Shelf, similar peaks at Piner Bay on January 30, and had covered 800 miles of coastline by February 12, from 140° 30' E. to 112° 16' 12\"E., when Wilkes acknowledged they had \"discovered the Antarctic Continent.\" Named Wilkes Land, it includes Claire Land, Banzare Land, Sabrina Land, Budd Land, and Knox Land. They reached a westward goal of 105° E., the edge of Queen Mary Land, before departing to the north again on February 21.\n\nThe \"Porpoise\" came across the French expedition of Jules Dumont d'Urville on January 30. However, due to a misunderstanding of each other's intentions, the Porpoise and Astrolabe were unable to communicate. In February 1840, some of the expedition were present at the initial signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand. Some of the squadron then proceeded back to Sydney for repairs, while the rest visited the Bay of Islands, before arriving in Tonga in April. At Nuku'alofa the met King Josiah (Aleamotu'a), and the George (Taufa'ahau), chief of Ha'apai, before proceeding onwards to Fiji on May 4. The \"Porpoise\" surveyed the Low Archipelago, while the \"Vincennes\" and \"Peacock\" proceeded onwards to Ovalau, where they signed a commercial treaty with Tanoa Visawaqa in Levuka. Edward Belcher's \"HMS Starling\" visited Ovalau at the same time. Hudson was able to capture Vendovi, after holding his brothers Cocanauto, Qaraniqio, and Tui Dreketi (Roko Tui Dreketi or King of Rewa Province) hostage. Vendovi was deemed responsible for the attack against US sailors on Ono Island in 1836. Vendovi was to be taken back to the US after a brief trial on board.\n\nIn July 1840, two members of the party, Lieutenant Underwood and Wilkes' nephew, Midshipman Wilkes Henry, were killed while bartering for food in western Fiji's Malolo Island. The cause of this event remains equivocal. Immediately prior to their deaths, the son of the local chief, who was being held as a hostage by the Americans, escaped by jumping out of the boat and running through the shallow water for shore. The Americans fired over his head. According to members of the expedition party on the boat, his escape was intended as a prearranged signal by the Fijians to attack. According to those on shore, the shooting actually precipitated the attack on the ground. The Americans landed sixty sailors to attack the hostile natives. Close to eighty Fijians were killed in the resulting American reprisal and two villages were burned to the ground.\n\nOn August 9, after three months of surveying, the squadron met off Macuata. The \"Vincennes\" and \"Peacock\" proceeded onwards to the Sandwich Islands, with the \"Flying Fish\" and \"Porpoise\" to meet them in Oahu by October. Along the way, Wilkes named the Phoenix Group and made a stop at the Palmyra Atoll, making their group the first scientific expedition in history to visit Palmyra. While in Hawaii, the officers were welcomed by Governor Kekuanaoa, King Kamehameha III, his aide William Richards, and the journalist James Jackson Jarves. The expedition surveyed Kauai, Oahu, Hawaii, and the peak of Mauna Loa. The \"Porpoise\" was dispatched in November to survey several of the Tuamotus, including Aratika, Kauehi, Raraka, and Katiu, before proceeding onwards to Penrhyn and returning to Oahu on 24 March.\n\nOn April 5, 1841, the squadron departed Honolulu, the \"Porpoise\" and \"Vincennes\" for the Pacific Northwest, the \"Peacock\" and \"Flying Fish\" to resurvey Samoa, before rejoining the squadron. Along the way, the \"Peacock\" and \"Flying Fish\" surveyed Jarvis Island, Enderbury Island, the Tokelau Islands, and Fakaofo. The \"Peacock\" followed this with surveys of the Tuvalu islands of Nukufetau, Vaitupu, and Nanumanga in March, followed by Tabiteuea in April. Also in April, the \"Peacock\" surveyed the Gilbert Islands of Nonouti, Aranuka, Maiana, Abemama, Kuria, Tarawa, Marakei, Butaritari, and Makin, before returning to Ohau on June 13. The \"Peacock\" and \"Flying Fish\" then left for the Columbia River on June 21.\n\nIn April 1841, USS \"Peacock\", under Lieutenant William L. Hudson, and USS \"Flying Fish\", surveyed Drummond's Island, which was named for an American of the expedition. Lieutenant Hudson heard from a member of his crew that a ship had wrecked off the island and her crew massacred by the Gilbertese. A woman and her child were said to be the only survivors, so Hudson decided to land a small force of marines and sailors, under William M. Walker, to search the island. Initially, the natives were peaceful and the Americans were able to explore the island, without results. It was when the party was returning to their ship that Hudson noticed a member of his crew was missing.\nAfter making another search, the man was not found and the natives began arming themselves. Lieutenant Walker returned his force to the ship, to converse with Hudson, who ordered Walker to return to shore and demand the return of the sailor. Walker then reboarded his boats with his landing party and headed to shore. Walker shouted his demand and the natives charged for him, forcing the boats to turn back to the ships. It was decided on the next day that the Americans would bombard the hostiles and land again. While doing this, a force of around 700 Gilbertese warriors opposed the American assault, but were defeated after a long battle. No Americans were hurt, but twelve natives were killed and others were wounded, and two villages were also destroyed. A similar episode occurred two months before in February when the \"Peacock\" and the \"Flying Fish\" briefly bombarded the island of Upolu, Samoa following the death of an American merchant sailor on the island.\n\nThe \"Vincennes\" and \"Porpoise\" reached Cape Disappointment on April 28, 1841, but then headed north to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Port Discovery, and Fort Nisqually, where they were welcomed by William Henry McNeill and Alexander Caulfield Anderson. The \"Porpoise\" surveyed the Admiralty Inlet, while boats from the \"Vincennes\" surveyed Hood Canal, and the coast northwards to the Fraser River. Wilkes visited Fort Clatsop, John McLoughlin at Fort Vancouver, and William Cannon on the Willamette River, while he sent Lt. Johnson on an expedition to Fort Okanogan, Fort Colvile and Fort Nez Perces, where they met Marcus Whitman. Like his predecessor, British explorer George Vancouver, Wilkes spent a good deal of time near Bainbridge Island. He noted the bird-like shape of the harbor at Winslow and named it Eagle Harbor. Continuing his fascination with bird names, he named Bill Point and Wing Point. Port Madison, Washington and Points Monroe and Jefferson were named in honor of former United States presidents. Port Ludlow was assigned to honor Lieutenant Augustus Ludlow, who lost his life during the War of 1812.\n\nThe \"Peacock\" and \"Flying Fish\" arrived off Cape Disappointment on July 17. However, the \"Peacock\" went aground while attempting to enter the Columbia River and was soon lost, though with no loss of life. The crew was able to lower six boats and get everyone into Baker's Bay, along with their journals, surveys, the chronometers, and some of Agate's sketches. A one-eyed Indian named George then guided the \"Flying Fish\" into the same bay.\nThere, the crew set up \"Peacockville\", assisted by James Birnie of the Hudson's Bay Company, and the American Methodist Mission at Point Adams. They also traded with the local Clatsop and Chinookan Indians over the next three weeks, while surveying the channel, before journeying to Fort George and a reunion with the rest of the squadron. This prompted Wilkes to send the \"Vincennes\" to San Francisco Bay, while he continued to survey Grays Harbor.\n\nFrom the area of modern-day Portland, Wilkes sent an overland party of 39 southwards, led by Emmons, but guided by Joseph Meek. The group included Agate, Eld, Colvocoresses, Brackenridge, Rich, Peale, Stearns, and Dana, and proceeded along an inland route to Fort Umpqua, Mount Shasta, the Sacramento River, John Sutter's New Helvetia, and then onwards to San Francisco Bay. They departed September 7, and arrived aboard the \"Vincennes\" in Sausalito on October 23, having traveled along the Siskiyou Trail.\n\nWilkes arrived with the \"Porpoise\" and \"Oregon\", while the \"Flying Fish\" was to rendezvous with the squadron in Honolulu. The squadron surveyed San Francisco and its tributaries, and later produced a map of \"Upper California\". The expedition then headed back out on October 31, arriving Honolulu on November 17, and departing on November 28. They included a visit to Wake Island, and returned by way of the Philippines, Borneo, Singapore, Polynesia, and the Cape of Good Hope, reaching New York on June 10, 1842.\n\nThe expedition was plagued by poor relationships between Wilkes and his subordinate officers throughout. Wilkes' self-proclaimed status as captain and commodore, accompanied by the flying of the requisite pennant and the wearing of a captain's uniform while being commissioned only as a Lieutenant, rankled heavily with other members of the expedition of similar real rank. His apparent mistreatment of many of his subordinates, and indulgence in punishments such as \"flogging round the fleet\" resulted in a major controversy on his return to America. Wilkes was court-martialled on his return, but was acquitted on all charges except that of illegally punishing men in his squadron.\n\nThe Wilkes Expedition played a major role in the development of 19th-century science, particularly in the growth of the American scientific establishment. Many of the species and other items found by the expedition helped form the basis of collections at the new Smithsonian Institution.\nWith the help of the expedition's scientists, derisively called \"\"clam digger\"s\" and \"bug catchers\" by navy crew members, 280 islands, mostly in the Pacific, were explored, and over 800 miles of Oregon were mapped. Of no less importance, over 60,000 plant and bird specimens were collected. A staggering amount of data and specimens were collected during the expedition, including the seeds of 648 species, which were later traded, planted, and sent throughout the country. Dried specimens were sent to the National Herbarium, now a part of the Smithsonian Institution. There were also 254 live plants, which mostly came from the home stretch of the journey, that were placed in a newly constructed greenhouse in 1850, which later became the United States Botanic Garden.\n\nAlfred Thomas Agate, engraver and illustrator, created an enduring record of traditional cultures such as the illustrations made of the dress and tattoo patterns of natives of the Ellice Islands (now Tuvalu).\n\nA collection of artifacts from the expedition also went to the National Institute for the Promotion of Science, a precursor of the Smithsonian Institution. These joined artifacts from American history as the first artifacts in the Smithsonian collection.\n\nFor a short time Wilkes was attached to the Office of Coast Survey, but from 1844 to 1861 he was chiefly engaged in preparing the expedition report. Twenty-eight volumes were planned, but only nineteen were published. Of these, Wilkes wrote the multi-volume \"Narrative of the United States exploring expedition, during 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, 1842\", \"Hydrography\", and \"Meteorology\". \n\nThe \"Narrative\" concerns the customs, political and economic conditions of many places then little-known. Other contributions were three reports by James Dwight Dana on \"Zoophytes\", \"Geology\", and \"Crustacea\". In addition to shorter articles and reports, Wilkes published \"Western America, including California and Oregon\", and \"Theory of the Winds\". The Smithsonian Institution digitized the five volume narrative and the accompanying scientific volumes. The mismanagement that plagued the expedition prior to its departure continued after its completion. By June 1848, many of the specimens had been lost or damaged and many remained unidentified. Asa Gray was hired to work on the botanical specimens.\n\n\n"}
