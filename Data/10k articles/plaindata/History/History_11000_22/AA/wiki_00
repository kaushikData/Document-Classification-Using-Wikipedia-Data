Its final two centuries coincide with Modern history, characterized by industrialization, the rise of nation states, the rapid development of science, widespread education, and universal health care and vaccinations in the Western world. The 20th century saw increasing globalization, most notably the two World Wars and the subsequent formation of the United Nations. 20th-century technology includes powered flight, television and semiconductor technology, including integrated circuits. The term \"Great Divergence\" was coined to refer the unprecedented cultural and political ascent of the Western world in the second half of the millennium, emerging by the 18th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization, having eclipsed Qing China and the Islamic World.\n\nWorld population has grown without precedent over the millennium, from 310 million in AD 1000 to about 6,000 million in AD 2000.\nDoubling time was at first seven centuries (reaching 600 million in 1700), and during the final three centuries population growth accelerated extremely, growth rate peaking at 1.8% p.a. in the second half of the 20th century.

Rotundus was vogt of Vilnius, general secretary to the Grand Duke and King Sigismund Augustus and elder of Stakliškės. After his nobilitation to the szlachta, Rotundus adopted surname Mieleski, or Milewski.\n\nRotundus was born in Wieluń around year 1520. His surname is supposed to be \"Mieleski\", although some researchers suggest that it was adopted later. \"Rotundus\" is translated nickname, probably inherited from his father – Mikołaj () \"Okrągły\" (), who was a rich furrier in the city of Wieluń.\n\nRotundus studied in University of Wittenberg and Lubrański Academy in Poznań, where he was suspected of writing a nasty lampoon about Poznań catholic chapter. Undoubtedly Rotundus was a passionate catholic after graduation and supported Hereditary monarchy and Execution movement. \n\nHe arrived in Vilnius, capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on August 20, 1551. He was invited by Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund Augustus as a legal advisor, and one who knew both Grand Duchy and Crown's law. Assigned as vogt of Vilnius in 1552 (most probably suggested by city inhabitants), he became loyal citizen of Lithuania, and wrote several works on Lithuania's history and political polemic works defending Lithuania's rights. In 1558 he was appointed as elder of Stakliškės. \n\nHe was married to Sofia Montanówna, Italian by origin (she died after March 10, 1604). They had a son, Nickolas, who died in his infancy and two daughters: Regina and Elizabeth. For his work and achievements Rotundus was ennobled in 1568 by Sejm held in Grodno. He was awarded Rola coat of arms. \n\nAugustinus Rotundus died on March 20, 1582 and was buried in the church of Saint John's - the Baptist and Evangelist, in Vilnius.\n\nRotundus supported Lithuanian statehood against claims of the Polish Crown. He was progenitor of mythical deductions and his passion were noble families. Rotundus contributed to the second and the third Statutes of Lithuania. He collaborated on these acts together with Peter Roisius, Ostafi Wołłowicz and Mikołaj \"the Black\" Radziwiłł. He personally translated the Second Statute into Latin and added his own study \"Epitome principum Lituaniae\" (Lithuanian Dukes Epitome) as a foreword. In this study Rotundus promoted the idea, that Lithuanians together with their Dukes have roots in the ancient Roman Empire, from the mythical house of Palemonids. Similar theories were raised by Jan Długosz, but both were lacking evidences to support this theory. \n\nRotundus was probably contributing to the second edition of the Lithuanian Chronicles. He claimed that Publius Libonus, Roman commander who fled from Julius Caesar and supposedly settled down in Lithuania, was ancestor of Lithuanian and Ruthenian rulers. Supposedly the name of \"Livonia\" comes from \"Libonus\". In his opinion, this explained why Latin language was common in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and also served to support sarmatism ideals. Rotundus was a close friend to other Vilnius renaissance scholars like physician Jan Antonin () and a poet Klemens Janicki (), after the latter died, both published Ianicius artworks. \n\nIn 1564 on personal request by Mikołaj \"the Black\" Radziwiłł Rotundus wrote \"Rozmowy Polaka z Litwinem\" (\"Conversations of Pole with Lithuanian\") – a polemic work, where he defended Lithuania's dignity against insults by Polish author Stanisław Orzechowski in \"Quincunx\" (1554), \"...against disgraceful and mistaken Stanisławs Orzechowski writing, which innocent famous Lithuanian Duchy insulted...\". Although it is recognized as Rotundus personal work, after thorough analysis of the work Lithuanian historian Ingė Lukšaitė suggested that it was a collective work by several authors.\n\n\n"}

Although pigs were small enough that a smoked pork carcass could be consumed by a single farming family before the meat spoiled, the same was not true of cattle, and smoked or salted beef was not popular in any case.\n\nAfter obtaining the slaughtered steer, the meat would be distributed among the members of the cooperative, providing them with a steak, a roast, and a boiling joint each week. By slaughtering each animal in sequence, the cooperative ensured that all members received fresh meat throughout the summer. Distributions were weighed, so that each member received a fair share of the meat.\n\nBeef rings died out for several reasons, including technological advances in refrigeration, greater economic prosperity for farmers, greater independence, and the ability of farmers to buy meat at butchers' shops rather than slaughter and store it themselves.\n"}
{"id": "299464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299464", "title": "Byzantine coinage", "text": "Byzantine coinage\n\nByzantine currency, money used in the Eastern Roman Empire after the fall of the West, consisted of mainly two types of coins: the gold solidus and a variety of clearly valued bronze coins. By the end of the empire the currency was issued only in silver stavrata and minor copper coins with no gold issue.\n\nEarly Byzantine coins continue the late Roman conventions: on the obverse the head of the Emperor, now full face rather than in profile, and on the reverse, usually a Christian symbol such as the cross, or a Victory or an angel (the two tending to merge into one another). The gold coins of Justinian II departed from these stable conventions by putting a bust of Christ on the obverse, and a half or full-length portrait of the Emperor on the reverse. These innovations incidentally had the effect of leading the Islamic Caliph Abd al-Malik, who had previously copied Byzantine styles but replacing Christian symbols with Islamic equivalents, finally to develop a distinctive Islamic style, with only lettering on both sides. This was then used on nearly all Islamic coinage until the modern period.\n\nThe type of Justinian II was revived after the end of Iconoclasm, and with variations remained the norm until the end of the Empire.\n\nIn the 10th century, so-called \"anonymous folles\" were struck instead of the earlier coins depicting the emperor. The anonymous folles featured the bust of Jesus on the obverse and the inscription \"XRISTUS/bASILEU/bASILE\", which translates to \"Christ, Emperor of Emperors\"\n\nByzantine coins followed, and took to the furthest extreme, the tendency of precious metal coinage to get thinner and wider as time goes on. Late Byzantine gold coins became thin wafers that could be bent by hand.\n\nThe Byzantine coinage had a prestige that lasted until near the end of the Empire. European rulers, once they again started issuing their own coins, tended to follow a simplified version of Byzantine patterns, with full face ruler portraits on the obverse.\n\nThe start of what is viewed as Byzantine currency by numismatics began with the monetary reform of Anastasius in 498, who reformed the late Roman Empire coinage system which consisted of the gold \"solidus\" and the bronze \"nummi\". The \"nummus\" was an extremely small bronze coin, at about 8–10 mm, weight of 0.56 g making it at 576 to the Roman pound which was inconvenient because a large number of them were required even for small transactions.\n\nNew bronze coins, multiples of the \"nummus\" were introduced, such as the 40 \"nummi\" (also known as the \"follis\"), 20 \"nummi\", 10 \"nummi\", and 5 \"nummi\" coins (other denominations were occasionally produced). The obverse (front) of these coins featured a highly stylized portrait of the emperor while the reverse (back) featured the value of the denomination represented according to the Greek numbering system (M=40, K=20, I=10, E=5). Silver coins were rarely produced.\n\nThe only regularly issued silver coin was the Hexagram first issued by Heraclius in 615 which lasted until the end of the 7th century, minted in varying fineness with a weight generally between 7.5 and 8.5 grams. It was succeeded by the initially ceremonial \"miliaresion\" established by Leo III the Isaurian in ca. 720, which became standard issue from ca. 830 on and until the late 11th century, when it was discontinued after being severely debased. Small transactions were conducted with bronze coinage throughout this period.\n\nThe gold \"solidus\" or \"nomisma\" remained a standard of international commerce until the 11th century, when it began to be debased under successive emperors beginning in the 1030s under the emperor Romanos Argyros (1028–1034). Until that time, the fineness of the gold remained consistent at about 0.955–0.980.\n\nThe Byzantine monetary system changed during the 7th century when the 40 \"nummi\" (also known as the \"follis\"), now significantly smaller, became the only bronze coin to be regularly issued. Although Justinian II (685–695 and 705–711) attempted a restoration of the \"follis\" size of Justinian I, the \"follis\" continued to slowly decrease in size.\n\nIn the early 9th century, a three-fourths-weight solidus was issued in parallel with a full-weight solidus, both preserving the standard of fineness, under a failed plan to force the market to accept the underweight coins at the value of the full weight coins. The ⁄ weight coin was called a \"tetarteron\" (a Greek comparative adjective, literally \"fourth-er\"), and the full weight solidus was called the \"histamenon\". The \"tetarteron\" was unpopular and was only sporadically reissued during the 10th century. The full weight solidus was struck at 72 to the Roman pound, roughly 4.48 grams in weight. There were also solidi of weight reduced by one \"siliqua\" issued for trade with the Near East. These reduced solidi, with a star both on obverse and reverse, weighed about 4.25 g.\n\nThe Byzantine solidus was valued in Western Europe, where it became known as the \"bezant\", a corruption of \"Byzantium\". The term bezant then became the name for the heraldic symbol of a roundel, tincture or - i.e. a gold disc.\n\nFormer money changer Michael IV the Paphlagonian (1034–41) assumed the throne of Byzantium in 1034 and began the slow process of debasing both the \"tetarteron nomisma\" and the \"histamenon nomisma\". The debasement was gradual at first, but then accelerated rapidly. about 21 carats (87.5% pure) during the reign of Constantine IX (1042–1055), 18 carats (75%) under Constantine X (1059–1067), 16 carats (66.7%) under Romanus IV (1068–1071), 14 carats (58%) under Michael VII (1071–1078), 8 carats (33%) under Nicephorus III (1078–1081) and 0 to 8 carats during the first eleven years of the reign of Alexius I (1081–1118). Under Alexius I Comnenus (1081–1118) the debased solidus (\"tetarteron\" and \"histamenon\") was discontinued and a gold coinage of higher fineness (generally .900-.950) was established, commonly called the \"hyperpyron\" at 4.45 grs. The \"hyperpyron\" was slightly smaller than the solidus. \n\nIt was introduced along with the electrum \"aspron trachy\" worth a third of a \"hyperpyron\" and about 25% gold and 75% silver, the billon \"aspron trachy\" or \"stamenon\" valued at 48 to the hyperpyron and with 7% silver wash and the copper \"tetarteron\" and \"noummion\" worth 18 and 36 to the billon \"aspron trachy\".\n\nDuring Andronicus II's reign he instituted a some new coinage based on the hyperpyron. They were the silver miliaresion or basilika at 12 to the hyperpyron and the billon politika at 96 per hyperpyron.\nalong with the copper assaria, tournesia and follara\nThe \"basilikon\" was a copy of the Venetian ducat and circulated since 1304 for fifty years.\n\nThe \"hyperpyron\" remained in regular issue and circulation until the 1350s, remaining in use thereafter only as a money of account. After 1400, Byzantine coinage became insignificant, as Italian money became the predominant circulating coinage.\n\nThese \"scyphate\" (cup-shaped) coins known as \"trachy\" were issued in both electrum (debased gold) and billon (debased silver). The exact reason for such coins is not known, although it is usually theorized that they were shaped for easier stacking.\n\nDuring this last phase of Byzantine coinage gold issues were discontinued and a regular silver issue was commenced. The denomination was the Stavraton issued in 1, a half, an eighth and a 16th of its value. Also issued were the copper follaro and tornesse.\n\nIt is possible to get some small snapshots in time, specific to region, culture and local inflation. The literary world is littered with references to prices from different time frames. A good portion of them may be inaccurate or tainted by translation. \n\nAt Jerusalem in the sixth century a building worker received 1/20 of a solidus per day, that is 9 folles. 1/23 of a solidus was earned by a casual labourer at Alexandria in the early seventh century. A family’s vegetable allowance for one day cost 5 folles. A pound of fish 6 folles, a loaf of bread was 3 folles worth at a time of shortage. The cheapest blanket was worth ¼ of a solidus, a second-hand cloak 1 solidus, and a donkey 3-4 solidi.\n\n\n\n"}

The Centre – previously known as the Division of History and Philosophy of Science, which was founded in 1956 – is one of the oldest institutions of its kind in the world. Throughout its history, the Centre has been home to many of the leading historians and philosophers of science who have shaped our understanding of scientific activity and how it shapes and is shaped by wider society.\n\nThe key figure in establishing history and philosophy of science (HPS) as a discipline at Leeds was the philosopher of science Stephen Toulmin, who was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Leeds in 1954 and head of department in 1956. Whilst Thomas Kuhn is often seen as the founder of the modern field of history and philosophy of science, Toulmin had argued for an integration of philosophy of science and history of science some nine years before Kuhn published his famous work, \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\".\nAfter becoming head of the department of philosophy, Toulmin hired two young scholars who would subsequently become amongst the most important thinkers in history and philosophy of science: Jerry Ravetz and June Goodfield. Furthermore, physicist-turned-historian Donald Cardwell become a research fellow in HPS and then a lecturer. However, Cardwell left Leeds in 1963 to start a similar department at UMIST. When Toulmin, followed by Goodfield, left Leeds for the USA in 1959, Ravetz led the Leeds HPS group into a period of expansion during the 1960s, which is described by many as a ‘golden age’ of HPS at Leeds. A number of scholars were hired, including Piyo Rattansi, Charles Webster, Ted McGuire, Maurice Crosland, and Charles Schmitt, and a number of postgraduate students who would go to become leading HPS thinkers, such as Margaret Jacob and Robert Fox, studied at Leeds with them. \n\nIn the 1970s, after the departures of – amongst others – Webster and Crosland, historian of genetics Robert Olby became a leading figure in the Division through his book \"Path to the Double Helix\", which showed how the 1953 discoveries of Crick and Watson were rooted in the work of two University of Leeds scientists: the creator of molecular biology, William Astbury, and the Nobel prizewinning inventor of X-ray crystallography, William Henry Bragg. During this period, a number of scholars who would shape HPS at Leeds during the 1980s and 1990s were appointed. These scholars included John Christie Jonathan Hodge and Geoffrey Cantor, whose groundbreaking research on the history of physics – in particular Isaac Newton and Michael Faraday – would earn him the first professorship in the HPS division at Leeds. Jonathan Hodge collaborated with Geoffrey Cantor on the classic co-edited study \"Conceptions of Ether: Studies in the History of Ether Theories, 1740–1900\" (1981). However, Dr Hodge’s main research interest lies in the history of theories of creation and, in this context, he has written historical articles on the theories of Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and Ronald Fisher, as well as philosophical pieces on evolutionary biology. In chronological terms, Hodge’s historical focus has been on the period 1770–1850, especially in France and Britain, working on Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles Darwin. Monographs are under preparation on the last two, following on from the \"Cambridge Companion to Darwin\" (2003), which was co-edited with recently arrived colleague Gregory Radick, and recently issued in a second edition to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the publication of \"On the Origin of Species\".\n\nJohn Christie has a broad range of expertise in enlightenment science, especially th history of chemistry. A significant proportion of his articles focus on the characters of William Cullen and Joseph Black in Edinburgh and on Joseph Priestley in Leeds. Christie, too, has collaborated with Geoffrey Cantor, their shared interests in linguistic aspects of science leading to the co-edited volume \"The Figural and the Literal: Problems of Language in the History of Science and Philosophy, 1630–1800\" (1987).\n\nNotable research students supervised by Cantor, Hodge, and Christie include:\n\n\nFurthermore, the collective endeavours of life in the Division of HPS at Leeds were epitomized in the much-cited multi-authored \"Companion to the History of Modern Science\" (1990), co-edited by Olby, Cantor, Christie and Hodge. Although there are now competitor volumes, articles from the Leeds Companion still reside on many a reading list for history of science courses throughout the world.\n\nFrom 1993 onwards, Leeds HPS took a new direction as several new specialist appointments were made in the philosophy of science, the history of medicine and the history of technology. Professor Steven French came to Leeds in 1993, having previously worked in Brazil and the USA. He teaches the philosophy of science, especially the philosophy of physics, and he has supervised numerous PhD students in both areas. His research covers several areas in the history and philosophy of physics. Primarily, Professor French is known for a structuralist approach to models and theories, which can be extended to cover issues of explanation and representation in science and also provides the formal basis for a form of structural realism. \n\nIn the same year that Steven French was appointed, Adrian Wilson, Lecturer in History of Medicine, came to the Division under a Wellcome University Award. Dr Wilson’s main research focus is seventeenth- and eighteenth-century midwifery/childbirth, particularly with reference to male and female roles in delivery – a subject he explored in his book \"The Making of Man-Midwifery\" (1995). However, Dr. Wilson also studies English provincial voluntary hospitals in the eighteenth century and the history of pathology. With help from colleagues, Dr. Wilson built up History of Medicine teaching both as part of the HPS degree programmes (BA and MA) and within the medical curriculum; and Leeds now offers an Intercalated Degree in History of Medicine (only the fourth such degree in Britain). \n\nIn 1994, Graeme Gooday was appointed to teach courses on the history and philosophy (especially the ethics) of technology. Gooday’s main research interests are in the history of late nineteenth-century physics, technology, instrumentation, and gender. In particular, as demonstrated by his first book, \"The Morals of Measurement: Accuracy, Irony and Trust in Late Victorian Electrical Practice\" (2004), Gooday focuses on the history of laboratories, the multifaceted roles of measurement and on the spatial issues of scientific practice.\n\nJonathan Tophamarrived in Leeds in 1999 as an AHRB Institutional Fellow for the Science in the Nineteenth-Century Periodical (SciPer) Project, having previously worked on the Darwin Correspondence Project and at the University of Cambridge. The work of the SciPer Project reflects Dr Topham’s wide interest in the production and reading of scientific publications in nineteenth-century Britain, a subject on which he has published a number of widely cited articles. Topham’s other main research focus is on science and religion, and he has published valuable articles on natural theology and theologies of nature in nineteenth-century Britain. As a lecturer in history and philosophy of science since January 2005, Topham has helped develop a new Masters programme in science communication in collaboration with the University of Leeds’s Institute of Communication Studies.\n\nAfter completing his postgraduate studies at Cambridge, Dr Gregory Radick was appointed as lecturer in the HPS Division in 2000 during Professor Cantor’s sabbatical, becoming a permanent member of staff in 2003. His research and teaching specialties are in the history of the life sciences and the human sciences, with special emphasis on questions of Darwinism and genetics. He has published and contributed to two co-edited volumes, including, with colleague Jonathan Hodge, \"The Cambridge Companion to Darwin\" (2003), which was recently issued as a second edition. Radick’s research work has concentrated on three themes in particular: scientific studies of animal mind and animal language; the role of social context and historical contingency in the development of modern biology; and the new genetic technologies in historical and philosophical perspective, concentrating especially on patenting and genetic testing. An interest in the relations between changing technology and changing knowledge runs throughout his work and was demonstrated in his first book, \"The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate About Animal Language\" (2008).\n\nNotable postgraduate students at Leeds during and since the 1990s include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "806560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=806560", "title": "Contemporary philosophy", "text": "Contemporary philosophy\n\nContemporary philosophy is the present period in the history of Western philosophy beginning at the early 20th century with the increasing professionalization of the discipline and the rise of analytic and continental philosophy.\n\nThe phrase \"contemporary philosophy\" is a piece of technical terminology in philosophy that refers to a specific period in the history of Western philosophy (namely the philosophy of the 20th and 21st centuries). However, the phrase is often confused with modern philosophy (which refers to an earlier period in Western philosophy), postmodern philosophy (which refers to continental philosophers' criticisms of modern philosophy), and with a non-technical use of the phrase referring to any recent philosophic work.\n\nProfessionalization is the social process by which any trade or occupation establishes the group norms of conduct, acceptable qualifications for membership of the profession, a professional body or association to oversee the conduct of members of the profession, and some degree of demarcation of the qualified from unqualified amateurs. The transformation into a profession brings about many subtle changes to a field of inquiry, but one more readily identifiable component of professionalization is the increasing irrelevance of \"the book\" to the field: \"research communiqués will begin to change in ways [...] whose modern end products are obvious to all and oppressive to many. No longer will [a member's] researches usually be embodied in books addressed [...] to anyone who might be interested in the subject matter of the field. Instead they will usually appear as brief articles addressed only to professional colleagues, the men whose knowledge of a shared paradigm can be assumed and who prove to be the only one able to read the papers addressed to them.\" Philosophy underwent this process toward the end of the 19th century, and it is one of the key distinguishing features of the contemporary philosophy era in Western philosophy.\n\nGermany was the first country to professionalize philosophy. At the end of 1817, Hegel was the first philosopher to be appointed professor by the State, namely by the Prussian Minister of Education, as an effect of Napoleonic reform in Prussia. In the United States, the professionalisation grew out of reforms to the American higher-education system largely based on the German model. James Campbell describes the professionalisation of philosophy in America as follows:\n\nProfessionalization in England was similarly tied to developments in higher-education. In his work on T.H. Green, Denys Leighton discusses these changes in British philosophy and Green's claim to the title of Britain's first professional academic philosopher:\n\nThe end result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical, peer-reviewed journals. While it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious, political or philosophical views that they consider their \"philosophy\", these views are rarely informed or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today. Furthermore, unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books, magazines, and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace, works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare. Philosopher Michael Sandel's book \"Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?\" and Harry Frankfurt's \"On Bullshit\" are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of non-philosophers. Both works became New York Times best sellers.\n\nNot long after their formation, the Western Philosophical Association and portions of the American Psychological Association merged with the American Philosophical Association to create what is today the main professional organization for philosophers in the United States: the American Philosophical Association. The association has three divisions: Pacific, Central and Eastern. Each division organises a large annual conference. The biggest of these is the Eastern Division Meeting, which usually attracts around 2,000 philosophers and takes place in a different east coast city each December. The Eastern Division Meeting is also the USA's largest recruitment event for philosophy jobs, with numerous universities sending teams to interview candidates for academic posts. Among its many other tasks, the association is responsible for administering many of the profession's top honors. For example, the Presidency of a Division of the American Philosophical Association is considered to be a professional honor and the American Philosophical Association Book Prize is one of the oldest prizes in philosophy. The largest academic organization devoted to specifically furthering the study of continental philosophy is the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy.\n\nConcerning professional journals today, a 2009 survey of mostly professional philosophers asked them to rank the highest quality \"general\" philosophy journals in English. The top 19 results were:\nConcerning continental philosophy specifically, a 2012 survey of mostly professional philosophers asked them to rank the highest quality \"continental tradition\" philosophy journals in English. Listing the survey's top 6 results:\n\nThe Philosophy Documentation Center publishes a well-known \"Directory of American Philosophers\" which is the standard reference work for information about philosophical activity in the United States and Canada. The directory is published every two years, alternating with its companion volume, the \"International Directory of Philosophy and Philosophers\" (the only edited source for extensive information on philosophical activity in Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, and Latin America).\n\nSince the start of the 21st century, philosophers have also seen the growing utilization of blogs as a means of professional exchange. A few notable milestones in this development include an informal listing of philosophy blogs begun by philosopher David Chalmers which has since become a widely used resource by the profession, the establishment of a partnership between ethics blog PEA Soup and the prominent journal Ethics to post featured articles for online discussion on the blog, and the role of blogs like What is it Like to be a Woman in Philosophy? in bringing attention to the experience of women in the profession.\n\nAyn Rand is perhaps the foremost example of an intellectual working contemporaneously with contemporary philosophy but whose contributions were not made within the professional discipline of \"philosophy\": \"For all her [Ayn Rand's] popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact.\"\n\nAlso working from outside the profession were philosophers such as Gerd B. Achenbach (\"Die reine und die praktische Philosophie. Drei Vorträge zur philosophischen Praxis\", 1983) and Michel Weber (see his \"Épreuve de la philosophie\", 2008) who have proposed since the 1980s various forms of philosophical counseling claiming to bring Socratic dialogues back to life in a quasi-psychotherapeutic framework.\n\nContemporary continental philosophy began with the work of Franz Brentano, Edmund Husserl, Adolf Reinach, and Martin Heidegger and the development of the philosophical method of phenomenology. This development was roughly contemporaneous with work by Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell inaugurating a new philosophical method based on the analysis of language via modern logic (hence the term \"analytic philosophy\").\n\nSome philosophers, such as Richard Rorty and Simon Glendinning, argue that this \"analytic–continental\" divide is inimical to the discipline as a whole. Others, such as John Searle, claim that continental philosophy, especially post-structuralist continental philosophy, should be expunged, on grounds that it is obscurantist and nebulous.\n\nAnalytic and continental philosophy share a common Western philosophical tradition up to Immanuel Kant. Afterwards, analytic and continental philosophers differ on the importance and influence of subsequent philosophers on their respective traditions. For instance, the German idealism school developed out of the work of Kant in the 1780s and 1790s and culminated in Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who is viewed highly by many continental philosophers. Conversely, Hegel is viewed as a relatively minor figure for the work of analytic philosophers.\n\nThe analytic program in philosophy is ordinarily dated to the work of English philosophers Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore in the early 20th century, building on the work of the German philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege. They turned away from then-dominant forms of Hegelianism (objecting in particular to its idealism and purported obscurity) and began to develop a new sort of conceptual analysis based on recent developments in logic. The most prominent example of this new method of conceptual analysis is Russell's 1905 paper \"On Denoting\", a paper that is widely seen to be the exemplar of the analytic program in philosophy.\n\nAlthough contemporary philosophers who self-identify as \"analytic\" have widely divergent interests, assumptions, and methods—and have often rejected the fundamental premises that defined the analytic movement between 1900 and 1960—analytic philosophy, in its contemporary state, is usually taken to be defined by a particular style characterized by precision and thoroughness about a narrow topic, and resistance to \"imprecise or cavalier discussions of broad topics.\"\n\nSome analytic philosophers at the end of the 20th century, such as Richard Rorty, have called for a major overhaul of the analytic philosophic tradition. In particular, Rorty has argued that analytic philosophers must learn important lessons from the work of continental philosophers. Some authors, such as Paul M. Livingston and Shaun Gallagher contend that there exist valuable insights common to both traditions while others, such as Timothy Williamson, have called for even stricter adherence to the methodological ideals of analytic philosophy:\n\nThe \"crude stereotypes\" that Williamson refers to in the above passage are these: that analytic philosophers produce carefully argued and rigorous analyses of trivially small philosophic puzzles, while continental philosophers produce profound and substantial results but only by deducing them from broad philosophical systems which themselves lack supporting arguments or clarity in their expression. Williamson himself seems to here distance himself from these stereotypes, but does accuse analytic philosophers of too often fitting the critical stereotype of continental philosophers by moving \"too fast\" to reach substantial results via poor arguments.\n\nThe history of continental philosophy is taken to begin in the early 1900s because its institutional roots descend directly from those of phenomenology. As a result, Edmund Husserl has often been credited as the founding figure in continental philosophy. Although, since analytic and continental philosophy have such starkly different views of philosophy after Kant, continental philosophy is also often understood in an extended sense to include any post-Kant philosophers or movements important to continental philosophy but not analytic philosophy.\n\nThe term \"continental philosophy\", like \"analytic philosophy\", marks a broad range of philosophical views and approaches not easily captured in a definition. It has even been suggested that the term may be more pejorative than descriptive, functioning as a label for types of western philosophy rejected or disliked by analytic philosophers. Indeed, continental philosophy is often characterized by its critics as philosophy that lacks the rigor of analytic philosophy. Nonetheless, certain descriptive rather than merely pejorative features have been seen to typically characterize continental philosophy:\n\n\nAnother approach to approximating a definition of continental philosophy is by listing some of the philosophical movements that are or have been central in continental philosophy: German idealism, phenomenology, existentialism (and its antecedents, such as the thought of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche), hermeneutics, structuralism, post-structuralism, French feminism, and the critical theory of the Frankfurt School and some other branches of Western Marxism.\n\n\n\nThe professionalization of philosophy\n\nThe Analytic / Continental divide\n\nAnalytic Philosophy\n\nContinental Philosophy\n\n"}
{"id": "24513157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24513157", "title": "Criticism of the Book of Mormon", "text": "Criticism of the Book of Mormon\n\nThe Book of Mormon is a sacred text of the Latter Day Saint movement, which adherents believe contains writings of ancient prophets who lived on the American continent from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421. It was first published in March 1830 by Joseph Smith as \"The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi\", who claimed that it had been written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as \"reformed Egyptian\" engraved on golden plates. Contemporary followers of the Latter Day Saint movement typically regard the text primarily as scripture, but also as a historical record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas.\n\nThe accuracy of Smith's story has been questioned, however. Most scholars reject Smith's claims of ancient origin and many believe that it was fabricated by Smith, drawing on material and ideas from contemporary 19th-century works rather than translating an ancient record, noting that no evidence of a supposed Reformed Egyptian language has ever been discovered. The content found within the book has also been questioned. Scholars have pointed out a number of anachronisms within the text, and no archaeological or genetic evidence has supported the book's claims about the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The text has also undergone many significant revisions, which critics see as a rebuttal of its supposedly divine origins.\n\nAdherents have defended the book against these scholarly claims. The oldest, and most significant, defense of the Smith's story comes from the testimonies of the Three Witnesses and the Eight Witnesses, which are published in every copy of the book. More contemporary adherents have also sought to rebut scholarly claims. For instance, an identification of Reformed Egyptian with a known ancient Egyptian dialect has been proposed. Some adherents have also claimed that various archaeological findings give evidence for the book's claims, but, as previously mentioned, there is no evidence for this.\n\nScholars reject Smith's explanation of the origin of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith said that the Book of Mormon was originally an ancient native-American record written on golden plates, and that God gave him the power to translate it into English. Critics note that there is no physical proof of the existence of golden plates; Smith said that the angel Moroni reclaimed the plates once he had completed the translation. To provide support towards the existence of the plates, Smith included two statements in the Book of Mormon saying that the Book of Mormon witnesses had been shown the plates, and their testimony is typically published at the beginning of the Book of Mormon. While none of these men ever retracted their statement, critics nevertheless discount these testimonies for varying reasons, one of which is because most of these men were closely interrelated. In later years Martin Harris, one of the witnesses, is recorded to have confessed that none of the witnesses saw the plates with their natural eyes but only through a vision.\n\nMost linguists, archeologists, and historians do not regard the Book of Mormon to be of ancient origin. In 1834 a publication by Eber D. Howe claimed that Smith had plagiarized an unpublished manuscript written by Solomon Spalding. Scholars today have varying theories about the true authorship of the Book of Mormon, but most conclude that Smith composed the book himself, possibly with the help of Oliver Cowdery and Sidney Rigdon, drawing from information and publications available in his time, including the King James Bible, \"The Wonders of Nature\", and \"View of the Hebrews\".\n\nTwo separate sets of witnesses, a set of three and a set of eight, testified as having seen the golden plates, the record from which the Book of Mormon was translated. Critics, including Jerald and Sandra Tanner, and the Institute for Religious Research note several pieces of evidence that they argue call into question the authenticity of the experience, including letters and affidavits in which Martin Harris stated that the Eight Witnesses never saw the plates, and that his own witness was more spiritual than physical. Additionally, each of the Three Witnesses (Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer) left the church during Joseph Smith's lifetime and considered Smith to have been a fallen prophet. Harris and Cowdery later returned to the church. However, the Institute for Religious Research disputes the sincerity of their conversion and return.\n\nApologists note that the witnesses in most cases affirmed their witness until their death, and claim that the aforementioned affidavits and letters are either fraudulent, or otherwise not reliable. In 1881 Whitmer, the one witness who never returned to the church, issued an affidavit reaffirming his testimony of the experience.\n\nHistorians view the language patterns, phrases, and names in the Book of Mormon as evidence that it is not authentic.\n\nJoseph Smith claimed to have translated the Book of Mormon from a language called Reformed Egyptian. Archaeologists and Egyptologists have found no evidence that this language ever existed. However, Hugh Nibley, a Mormon apologist, argues that Reformed Egyptian is actually Meroitic Egyptian.\nFurthermore, official LDS church commentary on the Book of Mormon says that at least some ancestors of Native Americans came from the Jerusalem area; however, Native American linguistic specialists have not found any Native American language that appears to be related to languages of the ancient Near East.\n\nSupporters point out the interesting elements of the creation drama that turn up in temple, tomb, or coffin texts from ancient Egypt that is described in detail in the Book of Mormon as the coronation of King Mosiah long before these ancient texts were understood by Egyptologists.\n\nSupporters of the Book of Mormon claim it uses chiasmus—a figure of speech utilizing inverted parallelism—and claim it is evidence to support the book's ancient origin. Critics such as Jerald and Sandra Tanner argue that chiasmus in the Book of Mormon are a characteristic of Joseph Smith's speech pattern and not evidence of antiquity. They cite chiasmus in the Doctrine and Covenants and the Book of Moses which were not translated from an ancient text as evidence.\n\nCritics claim that language patterns in the Book of Mormon indicate that it is merely a repetition of rhetorical patterns found in the Old Testament. They point out that the Book of Mormon contains many words and phrases that are not consistent with the time frame or location of the stories included in the book.\n\nSome critics theorize that Smith derived the account of the golden plates from treasure-hunting stories of William Kidd. Critics base this theory on the similarity of the names from Smith's account—Moroni and Cumorah—to the location Moroni, Comoros, related to Kidd's hunt for treasure. Apologists argue that it was unlikely that Smith had access to this material since at the time of the writing and publishing of the Book of Mormon his family were living in backwoods America, were very poor and there was no public library available to read such a book.\n\nThe only thing Joseph Smith ever said about the translation process was \"through the medium of the urim and thummim I translated the record, by the gift and power of God.\" Martin Harris, Joseph's second scribe, and David Whitmer, a witness of Joseph translating the plates to Oliver Cowdery, both describe the process as an exact word-for-word translation.\n\nModern LDS scholars tend to fall into two schools: tight control and loose control. Those who believe in tight control interpretation believe Joseph had very little leeway in the words used in dictating the Book of Mormon (but without being restricted to exact word-for-word). Those who believed in loose control interpretation believe that \"'ideas were revealed to Joseph Smith' and he put them 'into his own language.'\"\n\nThe Book of Mormon claims to be the original writings of Nephite leaders in ancient America, but it contains extensive quotation of the 17th century edition of the King James Bible (KJV) and the deuterocanonical books, which Joseph Smith's bible had as well. Furthermore, the language of the Book of Mormon mimics the Elizabethan English used in the KJV with 19th century English mixed into it.\n\nThe Book of Mormon quotes 25,000 words from the KJV Old Testament and over 2,000 words from the KJV New Testament.\n\nIndeed, there are numerous cases where the Nephite writers mimic wording from the New Testament—a document to which they had no access. Below are five examples out of a list of 400 examples created by Jerald and Sandra Tanner:\n\nHere are some parallels with the Deuterocanonical Books and the Book of Mormon. In particular, 2 Maccabees includes the name \"Nephi\". Examples of purported parallels include:\n\nCritics believe Joseph Smith came up with all the names in the Book of Mormon, noting that Joseph owned a King James Bible with a table listing all the names used in the Bible. Many Book of Mormon names are either biblical, formed from a rhyming pattern, changed by a prefix or suffix, or Greek in etymology. Furthermore, Jaredites and Nephites shared names despite the Jaradites being of a different time, place, and language than the Nephites. Lastly, some people would occasionally name their sons after their fathers, something not practiced in antiquity.\n\nMost, but not all, Mormons hold the book's connection to ancient American history as an article of their faith. However, this view finds little acceptance outside of Mormonism. The theory that the Book of Mormon is an ancient American history is considered to fall outside academic credibility. Mormon apologetics have proposed multiple theories tying Book of Mormon places to modern locations.\n\nThere are a number of words and phrases in the Book of Mormon that are anachronistic—their existence in the text of the Book of Mormon is at odds with known linguistic patterns, archaeological findings, or known historical events.\n\nEach of the anachronisms is a word, phrase, artifact, or other concept that critics, historians, archaeologists, or linguists believe did not exist in the Americas during the time period in which the Book of Mormon claims to have been written.\n\nApologists offer varying views on these anachronisms, typically countering them in one of two ways. One claim is that archaeological evidence may exist that has not yet been found. Another is that Joseph Smith used English words in a generic way, sometimes referring to an item other than that which the direct English word would imply.\nSince the publication of the Book of Mormon in 1830, both Mormon and non-Mormon archaeologists have attempted to find archaeological evidence to support or criticize it. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement generally believe that the Book of Mormon describes ancient historical events in the Americas, but historians and archaeologists do not regard it as a work of ancient American history.\n\nSome early 20th century researchers claimed various archaeological findings such as place names, and ruins of the Inca, Maya, Olmec, and other ancient American and Old World civilizations as giving credence to the Book of Mormon record. Others disagree with these conclusions, arguing that the Book of Mormon mentions several animals, plants, and technologies that are not substantiated by the archaeological record between 3100 BC to 400 AD in America.\n\nSince the late 1990s pioneering work of Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and others, scientists have developed techniques that attempt to use genetic markers to indicate the ethnic background and history of individual people. The data developed by these mainstream scientists tell us that the Native Americans have very distinctive DNA markers, and that some of them are most similar, among old world populations, to the DNA of people anciently associated with the Altay Mountains area of central Asia. This conclusion from a genetic perspective supports a large amount of archaeological, anthropological, and linguistic evidence that Native American peoples' ancestors migrated from Asia at the latest 16,500–13,000 years ago. (See Settlement of the Americas and Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas).\n\nThe mainstream scientific consensus about the origin of the ancient Americans and peoples is apparently at odds with the claims put forth in the Book of Mormon, although Mormon apologists have made efforts to reconcile these apparent contradictions.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints released an essay on their website titled \"Book of Mormon and DNA Studies\". The conclusion states, \"Much as critics and defenders of the Book of Mormon would like to use DNA studies to support their views, the evidence is simply inconclusive.\"\n\nCritics challenge the viability of the population size and growth of the Book of Mormon people. M. T. Lamb may have been the very first critic to suggest that the Book of Mormon has an unrealistic population growth rate. Modern studies on population size and growth have been done by John Kunich and FARMS writer James Smith. Kunich's analysis agrees with Lamb's that the Book of Mormon presents an unrealistic growth rate for the population, but Smith disagrees, and says that the growth rate is realistic.\n\nCritics point out that Joseph Smith also translated the Book of Abraham. Unlike the Book of Mormon, fragments of the documents from which Smith translated the Book of Abraham are available for inspection; Egyptologists find no resemblance between the original text and Smith's translation.\n\nSupporters point out that the Church has never claimed that the fragments of papyri which include facsimile 1, 2, and 3 are where Joseph Smith obtained his material for the Book of Abraham. These fragments are from the Egyptian Book of the Dead which was just one of the scrolls from Egypt that Joseph Smith had in his possession. When these fragments were discovered in the Metropolitan Museum many years ago, Hugh Nibley wrote a book called \"The Message of the Joseph Smith Papyri, An Ancient Egyptian Endowment\" showing how the fragments that had been discovered had nothing to do with the Book of Abraham but everything to do with Egyptian funeral texts from the \"Book of the Dead\".\n\nThe translation of the papyri by both Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists does not match the text of the Book of Abraham as purportedly translated by Joseph Smith. Indeed, the transliterated text from the recovered papyri and facsimiles published in the Book of Abraham contain no direct references, either historical or textual, to Abraham, and Abraham's name does not appear anywhere in the papyri or the facsimiles. Edward Ashment notes, \"The sign that Smith identified with Abraham ... is nothing more than the hieratic version of ... a 'w' in Egyptian. It has no phonetic or semantic relationship to [Smith's] 'Ah-broam.'\" University of Chicago Egyptologist Robert K. Ritner concluded in 2014 that the source of the Book of Abraham \"is the 'Breathing Permit of Hôr,' misunderstood and mistranslated by Joseph Smith\", and that the other papyri are common Egyptian funerary documents like the Book of the Dead.\n\nOriginal manuscripts of the Book of Abraham, microfilmed in 1966 by Jerald Tanner, show portions of the Joseph Smith Papyri and their purported translations into the Book of Abraham. Ritner concludes, contrary to the LDS position, due to the microfilms being published prior to the rediscovery of the Joseph Smith Papyri, that \"it is not true that 'no eyewitness account of the translation survives'\", that the Book of Abraham is \"confirmed as a perhaps well-meaning, but erroneous invention by Joseph Smith\", and \"despite its inauthenticity as a genuine historical narrative, the Book of Abraham remains a valuable witness to early American religious history and to the recourse to ancient texts as sources of modern religious faith and speculation\".\n\nCritics also challenge the divine origin of the Book of Mormon by noting the numerous revisions that have been made to the text. Though most changes are small spelling and grammar corrections, critics claim that even these are significant in light of Smith's claims of divine inspiration. Critics assert that some of these changes were systematic attempts to hide the book's flaws.\n\n\n\n"}

She then completed a Master of Arts degree (MA) at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1970. From 1973 to 1990, she was a Research Historian at the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia in Mexico; in 1990, she was awarded her doctorate (PhD) in history from the University of California, San Diego. She then joined the University of Missouri–St. Louis as an Assistant Professor and in 1995 moved to an equivalent post at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign; she became an Associate Professor there in 1999 and served as Acting Director of the University's Centre of Latin American and Caribbean Studies for the year 1999–2000. From 2004 to 2008, she was Professor of History at the University of New Mexico, where she was also Director of its Latin American and Iberian Institute (2004–07). She joined the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2008 as Gussenhoven Distinguished Professor of Latin American Studies and Professor of History, where she remains as of 2018.\n\nAccording to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's research profile, Radding's research on \"Latin American colonial history focus on the intersections between environmental and ethnographic history\"; she is particular interested in the imperial borderlands of the Spanish and Portuguese American empires and the way that indigenous people shaped society there. Her published works include \"Borderlands in World History, 1700-1914\" (London and New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2014), which she co-edited with Paul Readman and Chad Bryant, and \"Landscapes of Power and Identity: Comparative Histories in the Sonoran Desert and the Forests of Amazonia from Colony to Republic\" (Duke University Press, 2005).\n\nIn his review of \"Landscapes of Power and Identity\" for \"The Hispanic American Historical Review\", David Block argues that \"By narrating the interrelationship between humans and their natural surroundings, [Radding] challenges her readers to examine our understanding of the different ways that new societies formed on American frontiers and of the nature of boundaries themselves\" and states that her \"most important contribution ... is her thoughtful commentary on the nature of boundaries\". In \"Ethnography\", Barbara A. Sommer wrote that the book offered a \"sweeping, conceptually driven analysis of Sonora and Chiquitos\" which \"extend[s] ethnohistory to the Ibero-American periphery and reconfigure[s] the concept of frontier\", while her \"bold comparative approach\" is her \"most salient contribution to the historiography\". In \"The International Review of History\", Stuart McCook reiterated this point, arguing that Radding \"weaves the stories of these borderlands together to develop an innovative comparative study\". He goes on to state that the book is \"a superb example of how to incorporate the natural world into more traditional historical themes. It moves beyond the now-standard historical narratives of environmental decline in colonial Latin America to offer a more complex and nuanced picture of the interplay between nature and society in the late colonial and early national periods\".\n"}

(1889–1975) was an English entomologist and forest conservator who worked in India. Beeson was an expert on forest entomology who wrote numerous papers on insects, and whose book on Indian forest insects remains a standard work on the subject. After his retirement and return to England he became an antiquarian horologist.\n\nBeeson was born in Oxford on 10 February 1889 to Walter Thomas Beeson and Rose Eliza Beeson, \"née\" Clacey. Walter Beeson was Surveyor to St John's College, Oxford.\n\nCyril Beeson got married to Marion Cossentine in 1922 and they had a daughter, Barbara Rose, who was born \"circa\" 1925. Beeson's first wife died in 1946 after a long period of ill-health. In 1971, aged 82, Beeson got married to his second wife, Margaret Carbury.\n\nBeeson died on 3 November 1975.\n\nBeeson attended City of Oxford High School for Boys, where his best friend was T. E. Lawrence (better remembered today as Lawrence of Arabia). Lawrence called him by his nickname of \"Scroggs\".\n\nAt the age of 15 Beeson and Lawrence bicycled around Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, visited almost every village's parish church, studied their monuments and antiquities and made rubbings of their monumental brasses. The two schoolboys monitored building sites in Oxford and presented their finds to the Ashmolean Museum. The Ashmolean's \"Annual Report\" for 1906 said that the pair \"by incessant watchfulness secured everything of antiquarian value which has been found\". In the summers of 1906 and 1907 Beeson and Lawrence toured France by bicycle, collecting photographs, drawings and measurements of medieval castles. Beeson made many of the drawings that Lawrence used in his thesis \"The influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture – to the end of the 12th century\", which was published in 1936 as \"Crusader Castles\".\n\nBeeson entered the University of Oxford in 1907 to read geology. He was a non-collegiate student until 1908, when he won an exhibition that enabled him to enter St John's College. He graduated in 1910 but then changed disciplines to forestry, in which he obtained a diploma. He received his MA in 1917 and an Oxford D.Sc. in 1923.\n\nBeeson was a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps in the First World War.\n\nFrom 1911 until 1941 Beeson worked for the Imperial Forest Service (IFS) as a research officer, forest conservator and forest entomologist. The IFS seconded him to study tropical and forest entomology in London and Germany, after which he first served in the Punjab. In 1913 he was appointed Forest Zoologist of India. Beeson was closely involved with the development of the Forest Research Institute at Dehradun. In 1922 his post was renamed Forest Entomologist. He served in the same position until his retirement in 1941, when he was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire.\n\nBeeson's first book, \"The Ecology and Control of the Forest Insects of India and the Neighbouring Countries\" was published in 1941. It remained the standard work in its field, being republished in 1961 and 1993.\n\nBeeson returned to Oxford, where he became Director of the Imperial Forestry Bureau from 1945 to 1947. While he was Director of the IFB, Beeson and his wife moved to Adderbury in North Oxfordshire.\n\nWhen the couple moved to Adderbury, Beeson began to collect antique clocks, many of which originated from Oxfordshire. Beeson turned his scholarly and scientific approach to antiquarian horology, and in 1953 became a founder member of the Antiquarian Horological Society. He contributed many articles to the AHS's quarterly academic journal \"Antiquarian Horology\", and edited it for the year 1959–60.\n\nBeeson became a published authority on the prominent clockmakers Joseph Knibb (1640–1711) and John Knibb (1650–1722). Beeson's own collection included five clocks and three watches by John Knibb. He also developed a special interest in turret clocks and made an influential study of the clock installed in 1669 at Wadham College, Oxford, which he proposed was made by Joseph Knibb.\n\nBeeson joined the Banbury Historical Society soon after its foundation in 1958. He was Chairman of the BHS 1959–60 and founding editor of its journal \"Cake and Cockhorse\" 1959–62. In 1962 the AHS and BHS jointly published the first edition of Beeson's monograph, \"Clockmaking in Oxfordshire 1400–1850\".\n\nThe Museum of the History of Science, Oxford had started a small collection of historic clocks and watches in 1924. In 1966 Beeson greatly expanded this by presenting the Museum with his own historic collection, which included 42 longcase clocks, 24 other clocks and 13 watches. In 1967 the Museum published a second, enlarged edition of his book \"Clockmaking in Oxfordshire 1400–1850\". In 1971 the Museum published a broader study by Beeson, \"English Church Clocks 1280–1850: History and Classification\". This led the AHS in 1973 to form its turret clock section, of which Beeson became chairman. In 1972 Lord Bullock, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford opened the Museum of the History of Science's Beeson Room to house its horological collection.\n\nFor his final book Beeson returned to one of the castles in France that had interested him and T.E. Lawrence as teenagers. \"Perpignan 1356: The Making of a Tower Clock and Bell for the King's Castle\" is a substantial account of the tower clock and bell made in 1356 for the Palace of the Kings of Majorca at Perpignan.\n\nOver a period of more than 30 years Beeson published more than 60 scientific articles on tropical forest insects. He also edited the Indian forestry journal. Listed below are only the books that Beeson wrote, including journal articles that were republished as books.\n"}

The film had no budget, and at the outset Scahill and Rowley traveled to Afghanistan using money from a grant Scahill had received to support his reporting.\n\nInitially the film was not intended to have Scahill as a narrator or protagonist, instead acting as a \"tour guide\" as the film traveled between the sites of covert U.S. military action. David Riker was brought on board to assist with writing after an initial four-hour rough cut of the film was put together, and he convinced Scahill and Rowley to make the film more personal.\n\nDuring filming, Scahill and Rowley traveled to Somalia to meet warlords in different territories of the country. As no American insurance companies would cover them to travel there, they had to get kidnap and ransom insurance from another country.\n\nInvestigative journalist Jeremy Scahill travels to Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other countries where the United States has taken military action in the War on Terror. In Afghanistan, he investigates the United States military and government cover-up of the deaths of five civilians, including two pregnant women killed by US soldiers from the Joint Special Operations Command. After investigating the attack, Scahill travels to other sites of JSOC intervention, interviewing both proponents and opponents, and the survivors, of such raids, including U.S. Senator Ron Wyden.\n\nScahill also investigates the assassinations of American citizens Anwar al-Awlaki and his son Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, meeting with their family at their home in Yemen. Scahill suggests that the War on Terror is in fact a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" and causes the radicalization of Muslims. He also discusses the case of Yemeni investigative journalist Abdulelah Haider Shaye who was detained, tried and sentenced on terrorism-related charges after reporting on American drone strikes.\n\n\"Dirty Wars\" premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on , 2013. The film competed in the U.S. documentary section, and it won the Cinematography award.\n\nThe film was released in four theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC on , 2013. Over the opening weekend, it grossed an estimated $66,000, a theater average of $16,500. The film opened in British cinemas on , 2013 with showings in nine cities around the country.\n\n\"Dirty Wars\" received critical acclaim. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes certified the film as \"fresh\" with a score of 85% based on 67 reviews. Metacritic rated the film 76 based on 18 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The film obtained a high score of 7.5 out of 10 from the aggregation of more than 6000 votes at the Internet Movie Database.\n\nTrevor Johnston found the film to be a \"\"gripping investigative doc, which plays out like a classic conspiracy thriller as it follows a trail of clues to the heart of darkness behind President Obama’s good-guy facade. Scahill may not have the screen charisma of a Hollywood leading man, but he has the integrity to keep on pushing at closed doors even after threats are made to his personal security. He also widens his focus to include Yemen and Somalia and draws a pattern of state-sanctioned assassination by unchecked US special forces and their mercenary hirelings.\"\n\nHowever, Douglas Valentine wrote \"...the film is so devoid of historical context, and so contrived, as to render it a work of art, rather than political commentary. And as art, it is pure self-indulgence.\"\"\nSome reviewers criticized the film's focus on Scahill rather than on the issues he covers. Ella Taylor said that \"as a journalist Scahill is surely the messenger, not the subject, and the attention he receives in Dirty Wars distracts us from the bigger picture he paints.\"\n\n\"Dirty Wars\" was nominated for a 2013 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Christopher Barnett (Sound Designer at Skywalker Sound) won the 2014 Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing: Sound Effects, Foley, Dialogue, ADR and Music in a Feature Documentary, given by the Motion Picture Sound Editors society.\n\n\n"}

They emerged in western Germany out of the German Youth Movement of the late 1930s in response to the strict regimentation of the Hitler Youth. Similar in many ways to the \"Leipzig Meuten\", they consisted of young people, mainly between the ages of 14 and 17, who had evaded the Hitler Youth by leaving school (which was allowed at 14) and were also young enough to avoid military conscription, which was only compulsory from the age of 17 onward. The roots and background of the Edelweiss Pirates movement were detailed in the 2004 film \"Edelweiss Pirates\", directed by Niko von Glasow.\n\nThe origins of the \"Edelweißpiraten\" can be traced to the period immediately prior to World War II, as the state-controlled Hitler Youth was mobilized to indoctrinate young people, at the expense of the leisure activities previously offered to them. This tension was exacerbated once the war began and youth leaders were conscripted. In contrast, the \"Edelweißpiraten\" offered young people considerable freedom to express themselves and to mingle with members of the opposite sex, whereas Nazi youth movements were strictly segregated by gender, the Hitler Youth (\"Hitler-Jugend\") for boys and the \"League of German Girls\" (\"Bund Deutscher Mädel\") for girls. Although predominantly male, the casual meetings of the \"Edelweißpiraten\" even offered German adolescents an opportunity for sexual experimentation with the opposite sex. The \"Edelweißpiraten\" used many symbols of the outlawed German Youth Movement, including their tent (the \"Kohte\"), their style of clothing (the \"Jungenschaftsjacke\"), and their songs.\n\nThe first \"Edelweißpiraten\" appeared in the late 1930s in western Germany, comprising mostly young people between 14 and 18. Individual groups were closely associated with different regions but identifiable by a common style of dress with their own edelweiss badge and by their opposition to what they saw as the paramilitary nature of the Hitler Youth. Subgroups of the \"Edelweißpiraten\" included the \"Navajos\", centred on Cologne, the \"Kittelbach Pirates\" of Oberhausen and Düsseldorf, and the \"Roving Dudes\" of Essen. According to one Nazi official in 1941, \"Every child knows who the Kittelbach Pirates are. They are everywhere; there are more of them than there are Hitler Youth... They beat up the patrols... They never take no for an answer.\"\n\nAlthough they rejected the Nazis' authoritarianism, the \"Edelweißpiraten\"s nonconformist behaviour tended to be restricted to petty provocations. Despite this, they represented a group of youth who rebelled against the government's regimentation of leisure and were unimpressed by the propaganda touting \"Volksgemeinschaft\" (\"people's community\").\n\nDuring the war, many \"Edelweißpiraten\" supported the Allies and assisted deserters from the German Army. Some groups also collected propaganda leaflets dropped by Allied aircraft and pushed them through letterboxes.\n\nApart from gatherings on street corners, the \"Edelweißpiraten\" engaged in hiking and camping trips, defying the restrictions on free movement, which kept them away from the prying eyes of the totalitarian regime. They were highly antagonistic to the Hitler Youth, ambushing their patrols and taking great pride in beating them up. One of their slogans was \"Eternal War on the Hitler Youth\". As one subgroup, the Navajos, sang:\nThe Nazi response to the \"Edelweißpiraten\" was relatively minor before the war, because they were viewed as a minor irritant and it didn't fit in with the policy of selective terror. As the war went on, and some 'Pirates' activities got more extreme, the punishments did too. Individuals identified by the Gestapo as belonging to the various gangs were often rounded up and released with their heads shaved to shame them. In some cases, young people were sent to concentration camps for youth or temporarily detained in prison. On October 25, 1944, Heinrich Himmler ordered a crackdown on the group and in November of that year, a group of thirteen people, the heads of the \"Ehrenfelder Gruppe\", were publicly hanged in Cologne. Some of these were former \"Edelweißpiraten\". The \"Edelweißpiraten\" hanged included six teenagers, amongst them Bartholomäus Schink, called Barthel, former member of the local Navajos. Fritz Theilen survived.\n\nNevertheless, government repression never managed to break the spirit of most groups, which constituted a subculture that rejected the norms of Nazi society. While the \"Edelweißpiraten\" assisted army deserters and others hiding from the Third Reich, they have yet to receive recognition as a resistance movement (partly because they were viewed with contempt by many of their former Youth Movement comrades, because of their 'proletarian' background and 'criminal' activities), and the families of members killed by the Nazis have as yet received no reparations.\n\nContrary to what the Allies had hoped, the \"Edelweißpiraten\" were neither pro-British nor pro-American. In the early days of the Allied Occupation, they sought contact with the Occupying Authority to intervene on behalf of friends, and even to propose that they might go on patrol, as did the Wuppertal \"Edelweißpiraten\". They were taken seriously and courted by various factions; the first known pamphlets of the KPD (\"Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands\") in July 1945 were directed at them.\n\nWhile a small number of \"Edelweißpiraten\" remained in the Antifascist Youth and the Free German Youth organizations, the majority turned their back on these bodies as soon as they realized that, in the words of one member, \"politics were taking centre stage again\". For example, a group in Bergisch Gladbach disbanded when young people of Communist orientation tried to form a majority in the group.\n\nThe \"Edelweißpiraten's\" turning away from the re-authorized political youth groups forced them into the role of social outcasts and brought them into conflict with the Allies. The headquarters of the American Counter-Intelligence Corps in Frankfurt reported in May 1946 that Edelweiss activities were known throughout the British and American Zones.\nGroups identifying themselves as \"Edelweißpiraten\" conducted many violent attacks against Soviet Russian and Polish Displaced Persons. Author Peter Schult witnessed such an attack against a Polish black marketeer. There were also attacks against German women who were known to have been friends or been intimate with British soldiers.\n\nIn a trial held by a military court at Uelzen in April 1946, a juvenile named as Heinz D. was initially sentenced to death, for his \"...very active part in carrying out the nefarious schemes of the E. Piraten. An organization such as this might well threaten the peace of Europe.\" The sentence was commuted the following month to a prison term. In the Soviet Zone, young people suspected of being \"Edelweißpiraten\" were sentenced to a virtually obligatory 25 years in prison.\n\nControversy surrounded the claims that the group was Widerstandskämpfer [resistance fighters] after one member Fritz Theilen published his memoirs in 1984, leading to several legal battles that Theilen won. In April 2011, Colognes Mayor Jürgen Roters presented Theilen and four other survivors the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12223", "title": "Great man theory", "text": "Great man theory\n\nThe great man theory is a 19th-century idea according to which history can be largely explained by the impact of great men, or heroes; highly influential individuals who, due to either their personal charisma, intelligence, wisdom, or political skill used their power in a way that had a decisive historical impact. The theory was popularized in the 1840s by Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle, but in 1860 Herbert Spencer formulated a counter-argument that has remained influential throughout the 20th century to the present: Spencer said that such great men are the products of their societies, and that their actions would be impossible without the social conditions built before their lifetimes.\n\nCarlyle stated that \"The history of the world is but the biography of great men\", reflecting his belief that heroes shape history through both their personal attributes and divine inspiration. In his book \"On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History\", Carlyle saw history as having turned on the decisions of \"heroes\", giving detailed analysis of the influence of several such men (including Muhammad, Shakespeare, Martin Luther, Rousseau, Pericles, Napoleon, and Richard Wagner). Carlyle also felt that the study of great men was \"profitable\" to one's own heroic side; that by examining the lives led by such heroes, one could not help but uncover something about one's true nature.\n\nAmerican scholar Frederick Adams Woods supported the great man theory in his work \"The Influence of Monarchs: Steps in a New Science of History\". Woods investigated 386 rulers in Western Europe from the 12th century until the French revolution in the late 18th century and their influence on the course of historical events.\n\nThis theory is usually contrasted with \"history from below\", which emphasizes the life of the masses over the leader. An overwhelming wave of smaller events causes certain developments to occur. The Great Man approach to history was most fashionable with professional historians in the 19th century; a popular work of this school is the \"Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition\" (1911) which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history, but very few general or social histories. For example, all information on the post-Roman \"Migrations Period\" of European History is compiled under the biography of Attila the Hun. This heroic view of history was also strongly endorsed by some philosophers, such as Leon Bloy, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Spengler and Max Weber, but it fell out of favor after World War II.\n\nIn \"Untimely Meditations\", Nietzsche writes that \"the goal of humanity lies in its highest specimens\".\n\nIn \"Fear and Trembling\", Kierkegaard writes that \"to be able to fall down in such a way that the same second it looks as if one were standing and walking, to transform the leap of life into a walk, absolutely to express the sublime and the pedestrian—that only these knights of faith can do—this is the one and only prodigy.\"\n\nHegel, proceeding from providentialist theory, argued that \"what is real is reasonable\" and World-Historical individuals are World-Spirit's agents. Hegel wrote: \"Such are great historical men—whose own particular aims involve those large issues which are the will of the World-Spirit.\" Thus, according to Hegel, a great man does not create historical reality himself but only uncovers the inevitable future.\n\nOne of the most forceful critics of Carlyle's formulation of the great man theory was Herbert Spencer, who believed that attributing historical events to the decisions of individuals was a hopelessly primitive, childish, and unscientific position. He believed that the men Carlyle called \"great men\" were merely products of their social environment:\n\nTolstoy's \"War and Peace\" features criticism of Great Man Theories as a recurring theme in the philosophical digressions. According to Tolstoy, the significance of great individuals is imaginary; as a matter of fact they are only \"history's slaves\" realizing the decree of Providence.\n\nWilliam James in his lecture \"Great Men and Their Environment\" underlined the importance of the Great Man's congruence with the surroundings (in the broad sense), though his ultimate point was that environments and individuals shape each other reciprocally, just as environments and individual members of animal species do according to Darwinian theory.\n\nAmong modern critics of the theory, one, Sidney Hook, is supportive of the idea; he gives credit to those who shape events through their actions, and his book \"The Hero in History\" is devoted to the role of the hero and in history and influence of the outstanding persons.\n\nLeonid Grinin defines a historical figure (a great man) thus:\n\n"}

Moses Isserles, died in 1833, aged forty-four. On Jun 11, 1841 he married Doba Deutscher. While diligently occupied with his Talmudical studies, he came across the \"Tzemach Dawid,\" a chronological work by David Gans, which aroused his interest in Jewish biography and history. He received his ordination as rabbi from Solomon Kluger, Zvi Hirsch Chajes, and Dob Berush Meisels, the last named of whom was rabbi of Cracow until 1854. Dembitzer sided nevertheless with Meisel's rival, Saul Landau, in the quarrel about the rabbinate of Cracow. In 1856 Dembitzer became a dayyan in his native city, and was, like his older brother Jacob, advanced to the position of rosh Beth din, which he held till his death. In 1874 he visited Germany and made the acquaintance of Leopold Zunz and other Jewish scholars, with whom he corresponded on historical subjects.\n\nDembitzer's earlier works were all on halakic subjects, on which he was a recognized authority. His \"Maginne Eretz Yisrael\" (responsa, Lemberg, 1852); \"Dibre Hen,\" which appeared as a supplement to Solomon Kluger's \"Abodat ha-Kodesh\" (Zolkiev, 1863); and \"Liwyat Hen\" (Cracow, 1882) belong to that class. But the last-named, a critical commentary on the work \"RABYH\" of Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi, which Dembitzer published from a manuscript, contains much valuable material for the history of the Tosafists, which is interspersed among the pilpulistic arguments of the main subject. His chief historical work, \"Kelilat Yofi,\" of which the first part, containing biographies of the rabbis of Lemberg and of other Polish communities, appeared in 1888, and the second part, also biographical and historical, in 1893 (Cracow), is an important contribution to the science of Judaism. He is also the author of \"Michtave Bikoret,\" a valuable correspondence with the historian Heinrich Graetz about the Council of Four Lands (\"Otzar ha-Sifrut,\" iv. 193-243; also published separately, Cracow, 1892), and of a biography of the Tosafist Joseph Porat, which appeared posthumously in \"Ha-Hoker,\" ii. 48-59. The \"Mappelet Ir ha-Tzedek\" (1878), a severe and vindictive criticism of J. M. Zunz's \"Ir ha-Tzedek\" on the rabbis of Cracow, was likewise written by him, although the name of Joel Dembitzer, his younger brother, appears on the title-page as the nominal author.\n\n"}

As of 2013, there were around 10,000 ethnic Somalis in Lewiston and Portland.\n\nIn the 2000s, Somali immigrants in the United States began a secondary migration to Maine from other states due to the area's low crime rate, good schools and cheap housing. \n\nIn October 2002, Lewiston Mayor Laurier T. Raymond wrote an open letter addressed to leaders of the Somali community, predicting a negative impact on the city's social services and requesting that they discourage further relocation to Lewiston. The letter angered some people and prompted some community leaders and residents to speak out against the mayor, drawing national attention. Demonstrations were held in Lewiston, both by those who supported the immigrants' presence and those who opposed it.\n\nIn January 2003, a small white supremacist group demonstrated in Lewiston in support of the mayor, prompting a simultaneous counter-demonstration of about 4,000 people at Bates College and the organization of the \"Many and One Coalition\". Only 32 attended the rally by the white supremacist group. The mayor was out of state on the day of the rallies, while governor John Baldacci and other officials attended.\n\nIn 2006, a severed frozen pig's head was thrown into a Lewiston mosque while about 40 men were praying. This was considered very offensive by the Muslim community, as swine is proscribed in Islam. A man admitted to the act and claimed it to be a joke.\n\nIn 2006, KPMG International released a study identifying the best places to do business around the world and ranked Lewiston as the best in New England. In January 2009, \"Newsweek\" associated a drop in crime rate, soaring income per capita and increased business activity in Lewiston with recent immigration to the town by Somalis.\n\nIn June 2011, the \"Lewiston Sun Journal\" also noted the growing number of Somali recent immigrants earning high school degrees, with more enrolling in local community colleges. The university students consist of both adult undergraduate and continuing education pupils, as well as high school graduates. In 2015, immigrants from Somalia also led Lewiston High School's \"Blue Devils\" boys soccer team to win the state championships under coach Mike McGraw.\n\nIn 2011, there were an estimated 5,000 Somali immigrants in Lewiston. Around 5,000 Somalis also resided in Portland. According to the Immigrant Resource Center, there were approximately 7,500 immigrants from East Africa in Androscoggin County where Lewiston is located, including individuals from Somalia.\n\nSomalis have opened up community centers to cater to their community. In 2001, the non-profit organization United Somali Women of Maine (USWM) was founded in Lewiston, seeking to promote the empowerment of Somali women and girls across the state. The Somali Community Resource Center also provides English and citizenship classes among other services to Portland's resident Somalis, as does the Somali Cultural & Development Association.\n\nAs of 2014, the most common non-English language spoken by students of the Lewiston Public Schools is Somali. Speakers make up around 90% of the district's pupils who do not speak English as a native language.\n\nIn August 2010, the \"Lewiston Sun Journal\" reported that Somali entrepreneurs had helped reinvigorate downtown Lewiston by opening dozens of shops in previously closed storefronts. Amicable relations were also reported by the local merchants of French-Canadian descent and the Somali storekeepers.\n\nIn 2010, several Somali immigrants, now citizens of the United States and residents of Portland, filed to run for the Maine Legislature. Mohammed Dini ran in District 119 in a Democratic Party primary, and Badr Sharif ran in the Republican Party primary for District 116; both candidates were defeated in primary challenges. Additionally, Portland's Somali community led a campaign to permit non-citizens to vote in municipal elections.\n\nFollowing the 2016 U.S. presidential election of Donald Trump, the federal government released Executive Order 13780, a three-month travel restriction against citizens of six Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. Somalis and other immigrants in Lewiston as well as local residents worried that the temporary decision had put a strain on communal living.\n\nIn 2017, a record three Somalia-born candidates, all newcomers to politics, unsuccessfully ran for the school committee in Lewiston.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "78566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78566", "title": "Horse latitudes", "text": "Horse latitudes\n\nHoarse latitudes or subtropical highs are subtropical latitudes between 30 and 35 degrees both north and south where Earth's atmosphere is dominated by the subtropical high, an area of high pressure, which suppresses precipitation and cloud formation, and has variable winds mixed with calm winds.\n\nThe horse latitudes are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of air from high-altitude currents moving toward the poles. After reaching the earth's surface, this air spreads toward the equator as part of the prevailing trade winds or toward the poles as part of the westerlies. The belt in the Northern Hemisphere is sometimes called the \"calms of Cancer\" and that in the Southern Hemisphere the \"calms of Capricorn\".\n\nThe consistently warm, dry, and sunny conditions of the horse latitudes are the main cause for the existence of the world's major non-polar deserts, such as the Sahara Desert in Africa, the Arabian and Syrian deserts in the Middle East, the Mojave and Sonoran deserts in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, all in the Northern Hemisphere; and the Atacama Desert, the Kalahari Desert, and the Australian Desert in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nA likely and documented explanation is that the term is derived from the \"dead horse\" ritual of seamen (see Beating a dead horse). In this practice, the seaman paraded a straw-stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck before throwing it overboard. Seamen were paid partly in advance before a long voyage, and they frequently spent their pay all at once, resulting in a period of time without income. If they got advances from the ship's paymaster, they would incur debt. This period was called the \"dead horse\" time, and it usually lasted a month or two. The seaman's ceremony was to celebrate having worked off the \"dead horse\" debt. As west-bound shipping from Europe usually reached the subtropics at about the time the \"dead horse\" was worked off, the latitude became associated with the ceremony.\n\nAn alternative theory, of sufficient popularity to serve as an example of folk etymology, is that the term horse latitudes originates from when the Spanish transported horses by ship to their colonies in the West Indies and Americas. Ships often became becalmed in mid-ocean in this latitude, thus severely prolonging the voyage; the resulting water shortages made it impossible for the crew to keep the horses alive, and they would throw the dead or dying animals overboard.\n\nA third explanation, which simultaneously explains both the northern and southern horse latitudes and does not depend on the length of the voyage or the port of departure, is based on maritime terminology: a ship was said to be 'horsed' when, although there was insufficient wind for sail, the vessel could make good progress by latching on to a strong current. This was suggested by Edward Taube in his article \"The Sense of \"Horse\" in the Horse Latitudes\" (\"Journal of Geography\", October 1967). He argued the maritime use of 'horsed' described a ship that was being carried along by an ocean current or tide in the manner of a rider on horseback. The term had been in use since the end of the seventeenth century. Furthermore, \"The India Directory\" in its entry for Fernando de Noronha, an island off the coast of Brazil, mentions it had been visited frequently by ships \"occasioned by the currents having horsed them to the westward\".\n\n\"Horse Latitudes,\" The Doors song, a spoken-word piece written by Jim Morrison, from their second album, \"Strange Days,\" (1967), evokes the second explanation above. Morrison wrote the prose piece when he was 12 years old.\n\n\n"}

It is a dance drama and presents the story of Krishna in a series of eight plays and was created by Manaveda (1585–1658 AD), the then Zamorin Raja of Calicut in northern Kerala. The eight plays are: Avataram, Kaliyamardanam, Rasakrida, Kamsavadham, Swayamvaram, Banayuddham, Vividavadham and Swargarohanam. It survives in its glory at the Guruvayur Sri Krishna temple (Thrissur district, Kerala, India).\n\nThe troupe of players, once maintained by Zamorin of Calicut came to Guruvayur Devaswom. in 1958.The only troupe of artists are well maintained by devaswom till date.\n\nKrishnanattam is based on Krishnagiti (1654 AD) written by Manaveda, Zamorin of Calicut. It is believed that the Zamorin had a vision of Krishna who gave the king a peacock feather, which became the living symbol of this dance-drama. Krishnanattam players wore a peacock feather and thus commemorated the vision of the chieftain.\n\nKing Manaveda told Vilwamangalam about his ambition to view Krishna. The next day the Swamiyar told him that Guruvayurappan has given his consent and Manaveda can see Guruvayurappan playing in the early hours of the morning at the platform of the Elanji tree. He could only see and not touch Him. When as per this agreement, Manaveda saw Guruvayurappan in the form of little child Sri Krishna, he was so excited that he forgot himself and, rushed to embrace little Sree Krishna. Guruvayoorappan immediately disappeared saying, \"Vilwamangalam did not tell me that this will happen\". However, Manaveda got one peacock feather from the head gear of Bhagavan Krishna.\nThe peacock feather was incorporated in the headgear for the character of Sri Krishna in the dance drama Krishnanattam based on his own text krishnageeti which is composed of 8 chapters . It was performed near the sanctum sanctorum of the Guruvayur Temple. On the ninth day, Avatharam was repeated as the Zamorin felt that it was not auspicious to end the series with the demise of Lord Krishna. The blessed art form is still maintained by Guruvayur devaswom and staged as an offering by devotees.\n\nSamoothiri Manavedan Raja (1585–1658 AD) had education from Anayath Krishna pisharody and Desamangalath varrier.\n\nHe wrote Poorva bharatha champu (Sanskrit) in 1643.

His statue was installed near 'Panjajanyam' guest house in Guruvayur.\n\nThe Sanskrit text based on which Krishnanattam was created was written on A.D 1653, aged 68. It consists of eight plays: Avataram, Kaliyamardanam, Rasakrida, Kamsavadham, Swayamvaram, Banayuddham, Vividavadham, and Swargarohanam.It is based on 10th and 11th skandhas of Bhagavata Purana dealing solely the story of Krishna. It has also gained inspirations from Gita Govinda of Jayadeva, Sree krishna vilaasam mahakavya and Narayaniyam of Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri.\n\nOpening sloka of Krishnanattam is\n\nApart from such slokas it is also adorned by many padyageethams like that of Gita Govinda of Jayadeva.Krishnagiti is a masterpiece work in sanskrit by a keralite.\n\nThe eight plays are: Avataram, Kaliyamardanam, Rasakrida, Kamsavadham, Swayamvaram, Banayuddham, Vividavadham and Swargarohanam. its easily memorised by a mnemonic \"a-ka-ra-ka-swa-bha-vi-swa\".On the ninth day, Avatharam is repeated.\nThe various benefits of Krishnanattam as an offering are listed here.\n\n\nAll four aspects of a drama,as told by Bharata Muni-viz, Angika, Vachika, Aharya and Satvika are well coordinated in it.\n\nThe teachers and artists themselves made the costumes.

These are called chilanka.\n\nThe actors used any or three colours for their basic make-up.\n\nThe green for Krishna as a young child has more yellow than blue. Before applying make-up the actor prostrated himself before the oil lamp and thought of the God Guruvayoorappan.\n\nThe most sacred part of the Krishnanattam costume is the head gear. There are two basic kinds of head dress; a mudi, 'hair that has been wound into a bun and a kiriitam 'a crown'.\n\nTraining for artists starts as early as 10 years for 'vesham' and music,5 years for Madhalam and chutti. Oil massage and sternous exercises makes an artist well enough to perform on stage.\n\nNight performances in Guruvayur temple in north to Lord Guruvayurappan occurs as offering by devotees.

{"id": "19590450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19590450", "title": "Obcell", "text": "Obcell\n\nObcells are hypothetical proto-organisms or (earliest form of life). The term was first proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 2001. According to Cavalier-Smith's theory for the origin of the first cell, two cup-shaped obcells or hemicells fused to make a protocell with double-lipid layer envelope, internal genome and ribosomes, protocytosol, and periplasm.\n\nThe beginning of life and living organisms is difficult to specifically date as proto-organisms' earliest existence left no paleontological clues. Cavalier-Smith argues that initially there was primordial soup which contained amino acids, the building blocks for proteins. Replication and phosphorylation were not relevant until the prebiotic soup started to become organized into the \"nucleic acid\" era. Although still not \"living,\" the substances during this period could replicate and undergo organized chemical processes. Based off these orderly processes, the world transitioned into an obcell world which included coding for proteins and chromosomes and the symbiotic interactions between membranes, genes, and enzymes. Obcells probably had a single membrane that was lipid-dense and also had specific cytoskeletal proteins that gave the obcells its curvature. These skeletal proteins were probably contained within the obcell's protoperiplasm.\n\nBased on the high concentration of phosphate in the Earth's crust, the universal metabolism of pyrophosphate and polyP in modern cells, the ability to form phosphates abiotically, and its simplicity compared to nucleotides and nucleic acids, replication probably began on phosphate-rich mineral surfaces and involved phosphate related enzymes. Replicases are necessary for the genetic code to have existed, so Cavalier-Smith argues that \"polyP kinases and pyrophosphate kinases may have been among the earliest protein-coded catalysts.\" If these did exist, then polyP-binding proteins would have been the most useful source of energy for the obcells. Due to its anionic properties, it is quite plausible that while immersed in the nucleotide and nucleic acid rich environment, polyP-binding proteins could have polymerized with these substances. Therefore, obcells with exonucleases attached to their membrane would have had an advantage for replication compared to those that did not. In modern cells, glucokinases typically have two different phosphate-binding domains, mainly containing the amino acids glycine, threonine, and aspartate. Therefore, Cavalier-Smith proposes that these shared domains could have originated in obcells to bind to pyrophosphate.\n\nCavalier-Smith argues that the most plausible location for obcells to survive and grow in number on Earth was by the land-water interface, not by oceanic seafloor vents. Due to their likely dependence on polyP and pyrophosphate for energy overAdenosine triphosphate ATP, obcells would likely congregate in areas where these minerals were formed in high concentrations. Polyphosphate could easily be formed by the seashore in \"small salty pools, porous sediments, or protosoils.\"\n\nFrom the obcells' dependence on polyP and pyrophosphate for energy, their metabolism did not rely on oxidative phosphorylation or photophosphorylation. These processes were too complex for the simple nature of obcells. Cavalier-Smith calls the obcells' phosphorylation of these minerals for energy \"lithophosphorylation\", which is simple and possible from the existence of kinases that could catalyze polyP- binding proteins and pyrophosphate-binding proteins. From this, it is likely that obcells had these kinases on their surfaces to react with these external polyP-binding and pyrophosphate proteins. Polyphosphate and pyrophosphate were possibly small enough to diffuse into obcells. Therefore, it also likely that some of these kinases were in the obcell lumen to react with these proteins and then store them for later use. This storage would be beneficial for obcells in times when the concentration of external polyP-binding proteins and pyrophosphate-binding proteins would vary.\n\nSince obcells were cup-shaped and could expose their chromosomes to the harsh environment, to protect their genetic information and any signaling factors, obcells could attach to polyphosphate surfaces using local adhesin proteins. During division, division proteins would begin to pinch the obcell in half, separating the internal components between the two daughter obcells. As this pinching was occurring, the structural integrity of the membrane began to weaken and the two halves would migrate towards the polyphosphate surface. Adhesin proteins would attach these ends to the surface and division would be complete.\n\nOver several millions of years, obcells managed to survive off division only. Eventually, obcells evolved to fuse into proto-organisms for added protection of their internal components and the decreased probability of the loss of oligosaccharides during division. Two obcells would come in contact with each other and would adhere together by the adhesion proteins at the rims of both. This adhesion could also be firmer than on the polyphosphate surfaces without restricting division and growth. The fusions of obcells lead to the creation of cytosol, compared to obcell division. From this, the membrane began to change into a cytoplasmic side and an outer side, the preliminary double membrane of modern protocells. In order to prevent the obcells from completely fusing together, it is believed that the after the two obcells adhered together, the adhesin proteins continued to act as plugs. These points of adhesion could have allowed transport for some substances between the cytosol and environment, but these could have evolved into Bayer's patches which are breaks between the cytoplasmic side and outer side of the membrane in gram-negative bacteria.\n"}

Pherecydes authored a cosmogony, derived from three divine principles, \"Zas\" (Zeus), \"Cthonie\" (Earth) and \"Chronos\" (Time), known as the \"Pentemychos\" (Πεντέμυχος, \"of the five recesses\"; sometimes the alternative title \"Heptamychos\", \"seven recesses\" is given). It formed a bridge between the mythological thought of Hesiod and pre-Socratic philosophy. His work is lost, but it survived into the Hellenistic period and we are informed on part of its content indirectly. Pherecydes was said to have been the first writer to communicate philosophical musings in prose. According to William (ca. 1896), \"Aristotle regarded him partly a mythological writer and Plutarch, as well as many other writers gave him the title of Theologus\".\n\nAccording to tradition Pherecydes was a native of the island of Syros and flourished in the 59th Olympiad (544–541 BC). It was said that he was a son of one Babys. Schibli (1990) dates his birth in the 49th olympiad (584–581).\n\nAnecdotes of \"unknown reliability\" place Pherecydes on the island of Samos, and in the city of Ephesus, where he is supposed to have been buried, although another tradition claims he was buried on Delos.\n\nAristotle wrote in his \"Metaphysics\" of Pherecydes being in part a mythological writer and Plutarch, in his \"Parallel Lives\", instead wrote of him being a theologian. He was considered to have had the greater significance in teaching on the subject of metempsychosis.\n\nHis writings were extant in the Hellenistic period, although only fragments have survived to the present day. His works were written in prose rather than verse and he has been said to have been the first to have communicated or conveyed philosophical musings in this form. Tradition maintains that Pherecydes lived in two caves in the northern part of the island of Syros. His summer habitation remains a popular tourist destination to this day.\n\nSome sources say that Pherecydes' book was entitled \"Pentemychos\" (Πεντέμυχος \"Pentemuchos\") translated as five () \"recesses\" (μυχός \"muchos\", \"nook, cranny, recess\", also \"sanctuary\" as in \"small domestic altar in a corner\"). in some sources said to have been titled \"Heptamychos\" (\"seven () recesses\").\nThere seems to be no complete agreement among scholars on which sources to trust regarding the title of Pherecydes' book, the standard survey reference on the Presocratic philosophers by Kirk, Raven and Schofield, opts for \"Heptamychos\". The author of the only modern scholarly book devoted entirely to Pherecydes, Hermann S. Schibli, argues that \"Pentemychos\" was the true title. In this work, Pherecydes taught his philosophy through the medium of mythic representations. Although it is lost, the fragments that survive are enough to reconstruct a basic outline.\n\nIn the older cosmogony of Hesiod (8th–7th century BC) the initial state of the universe is Chaos, a dark void considered as a divine primordial condition and the creation is \"ex nihilo\" (out of nothing).\nPherecydes probably interpreted \"chaos\" as water and he does not place it at the very beginning. In his cosmogony there are three divine principles, \"Zas\" (Ζάς, Zeus), \"Cthonie\" (Χθονίη, Earth) and \"Chronos\" (Χρόνος, Time) who always existed.\n\nThe semen (seeds) of Chronos which can probably be considered as a \"watery chaos\" was placed in the recesses and composed numerous other offsprings of gods. This is described in a fragment preserved in Damascius' \"On First Principles\".\n\nA close relationship is thought to exist between these recesses and Chthonie.\nHesiod described Tartaros as being \"in a recess (\"muchos\") of broad-wayed earth\". Hermann S. Schibli thinks the five \"muchos\" were actually harboured within Chthonie, or at least were so initially when Chronos disposed his seed in the five \"nooks\".\n\nAlongside Chthonie and Chronos, Pherecydes held a power called Zas. Zas (Zeus), comparable with the Orphic Eros in function, and as such a personification of masculine (sexual) creativity.\nProclus said that \"Pherecydes used to say that Zeus changed into Eros when about to create, for the reason that, having created the world from opposites, he led it into agreement and peace and sowed sameness in all things, and unity that interpenetrates the universe\".\n\nThe act of creation itself (perhaps it is more accurate to say that Chronos creates and that Zas orders and distributes) is described mytho-poetically as Zas making a cloth on which he decorates earth and sea, and which he then presents as a wedding gift to Chthonie, and wraps around her. Yet, in another fragment it is not Chthonie, but \"a winged oak\" that he wraps the cloth around. The \"winged oak\" in this cosmology has no precedent in Greek tradition.\n\nThe stories are different but not mutually exclusive, because much is lacking in the fragments, but it seems clear that creation is hindered by chaotic forces.\n\nBefore the world is ordered a cosmic battle takes place, with Cronus as the head of one side and Ophioneus as the leader of the other. The same story is elsewhere enacted with Zeus and Typhon/Typhoeus as leading characters, and it also has close parallels in many myths from cultures other than the Greek (Marduk vs. Tiamat, etc.). Ophioneus and its brood are often depicted as ruling the birthing cosmos for some time, before falling from power. The chaotic forces are eternal and cannot be destroyed; instead they are thrown out from the ordered world and locked away in Tartaros in a kind of \"appointment of the spheres\", in which the victor (Zeus-Cronus) takes possession of the sky and of space and time. The locks to Tartaros are fashioned in iron by Zeus, and might hence have been associated with his element of \"aither\", and in bronze by Poseidon, which might indicate a link to water (which was often conceived of as the \"first matter\"). Judging from some ancient fragments Ophioneus is thrown into Okeanos, not into Tartaros.\n\nExactly what entities or forces that were locked away in Pherecydes’ story cannot be known for sure. There may have been five principal figures. Ophioneus and Typhon are one and the same, and Eurynome fought on the side of Ophioneus against Cronus. Chthonie is a principal \"thing\" of the underworld, but whether she is to be counted as one of the five or the five \"sum-total\" is an open question. Apart from these it is known that Ophioneus-Typhon mated with Echidna, and that Echidna herself was somehow mysteriously \"produced\" by Callirhoe. If Pherecydes counted five principal entities in association the pentemychos doctrine, then Ophioneus, Eurynome, Echidna, Calirrhoe and Chthonie are the main contenders.\nCronus (or Zeus in the more popularly known version) orders the offspring out from the cosmos to Tartaros. There they are kept behind locked gates, fashioned in iron (associated with Zeus and his element of sky/space) and bronze (by Poseidon—the water force). We are told about chaotic beings put into the pentemychos, and we are told that the Darkness has an offspring that is cast into the recesses of Tartaros. No surviving fragment makes the connection, but it is possible that the prison-house in Tartaros and the pentemychos are ways of referring to the essentially same thing. According to Celsus, Pherecydes said that: \"Below that portion is the portion of Tartaros; the daughters of Boreas [the north wind], the Harpies and Thuella [Storm], guard it; there Zeus banished any of the gods whenever one behaves with insolence.\" Thus the identity between Zeus' prison-house and the pentemychos seems likely.\n\nPherecydes' \"Pentemychos\" was thought to have contained a mystical esoteric teaching, treated allegorically. One ancient commentator said that:\nA comparatively large number of sources say Pherecydes was the first to teach the eternality and transmigration (\"metempsychosis\") of human souls. Both Cicero and Augustine thought of him having given the first teaching of the \"immortality of the soul\". It is not surprising that some considered Pherecydes to have been the teacher of Pythagoras. That he was the first to teach such a thing is doubtful, but that he was among the first and that he did profess this teaching is certain. Hermann S. Schibli concludes that Pherecydes \"included in his book [\"Pentemychos\"] at least a rudimentary treatment of the immortality of the soul, its wanderings in the underworld, and the reasons for the soul’s incarnations\".\n\nPherecydes was occasionally counted among the Seven Sages of Greece. A sun-dial (\"heliotropion\"), supposedly made by Pherecydes, was said by Diogenes Laërtius to be \"preserved on the island of Syros.\"\n\nBasing himself on the extant fragments of Pherecydes' work, on testimonia from ancient authors regarding Pherecydes' philosophy, as well as on themes from Ancient Greek and Near Eastern mythologies, Hermann S. Schibli offers the following reconstruction of the main elements of Pherecydes' lost book:\n\n\n"}

The district was subdivided in 1990 into six new districts, see present-day districts of Kraków for more details. The name Podgórze roughly translates as \"the base of a hill\". Initially a small settlement, in the years following the First Partition of Poland the town's development was promoted by the Austria-Hungary Emperor Joseph II who in 1784 granted it the city status, as the Royal Free City of Podgórze. In the following years it was a self-governing administrative unit. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 and the takeover of the entire city by the Empire, Podgórze lost it political role of an independent suburb across the river from the Old Town.\n\nThe administrative reform of 1810 which followed the expansion of the Duchy of Warsaw brought Podgórze together with the rest of the historic city. However, after the Congress of Vienna made Kraków a free city in 1815, Podgórze fell back under the Austrian rule and remained there for the rest of the 19th century. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, in 1910 it was the 13th largest town in the Austrian-ruled Galicia (population 18,142 in 1900). In the years leading to the return of Polish independence, the city council discussions from July 1915 made Podgórze again a part of the Greater Kraków (\"Wielki Kraków\"); its president, the vice president of a single administrative unit.\n\nThe oldest man-made structure in Podgórze is the Krakus Mound () on Lasota Hill, believed to be the grave of the legendary prince Krakus. It is the largest prehistoric mound in Poland and one of the best view points in the city.\n\nThe Austrian bridge named Carl's Bridge (), linking Podgórze with the Kraków proper across the Vistula was built in 1802. This wooden structure located between today's Mostowa and Brodzińskiego streets, survived only until 1813 when it was destroyed in a flood.\n\nTowards the end of the Austrian rule, in 1915 the size of Podgórze reached of the size of Kraków. Since the return of Poland's independence, it remained integrated into the city. It includes the historic part of Podgórze with the triangular market square and impressive St. Joseph Church as well as the green hills of Krzemionki with the World War II quarry called \"Liban\". It also includes the site of the Nazi Kraków Ghetto and a factory of Oskar Schindler who saved nearly 1,200 Jews from the camps, as well as the old villages (now suburbs) of Płaszów, Rybitwy and Przewóz. The district population as of 31 December 2006 was 31,599 at an area of 2,456 ha.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1340095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1340095", "title": "Prosopography", "text": "Prosopography\n\nIn historical studies, prosopography is an investigation of the common characteristics of a historical group, whose individual biographies may be largely untraceable, by means of a collective study of their lives, in multiple career-line analysis. Prosopographical research has the goal of learning about patterns of relationships and activities through the study of collective biography; it collects and analyses statistically relevant quantities of biographical data about a well-defined group of individuals. This makes it a valuable technique for studying many pre-modern societies.\n\nBritish historian Lawrence Stone (1919–1999) brought the term to general attention in an explanatory article in 1971. The word is drawn from the figure of prosopopeia in classical rhetoric, introduced by Quintilian, in which an absent or imagined person is figured forth—the \"face created\" as the Greek suggests—in words, as if present.\n\nStone noted two uses of prosopography as an historian's tool: first, in uncovering deeper interests and connections beneath the superficial rhetoric of politics, in order to examine the structure of the political machine; and second, in analysing the changing roles in society of particular status groups—holders of offices, members of associations—and assessing social mobility through family origins and social connections of recruits to those offices or memberships. \"Invented as a tool of political history,\" Stone observed, \"it is now being increasingly employed by the social historians.\"\n\nA certain mass of data is required for prosopographical research. The collection of data underlies the creation of a prosopography and, in contemporary research, this is usually in the form of an electronic database. But data assembly is not the goal of the research; rather, the objective is to understand patterns and relationships by analysing the data. A uniform set of criteria needs to be applied to the group in order to achieve meaningful results. And, as with any historical study, understanding the context of the lives studied is essential.\n\nIn the words of prosopographer Katharine Keats-Rohan, \"prosopography is about what the analysis of the sum of data about many individuals can tell us about the different types of connection between them, and hence about how they operated within and upon the institutions—social, political, legal, economic, intellectual—of their time\".\n\nIn this sense prosopography is clearly related to, but distinct from, both biography and genealogy. Whilst biography and prosopography overlap, and prosopography is interested in the details of individuals' lives, a prosopography is more than the plural of biography. A prosopography is not just any collection of biographies—the lives must have enough in common for relationships and connections to be uncovered. Genealogy, as practiced by family historians, has as its goal the reconstruction of familial relationships, and as such, well-conducted genealogical research may form the basis of a prosopography, but the goals of prosopographical research are generally wider. \n\nThe nature of prosopographical research has developed over time. In his 1971 essay, Lawrence Stone discussed an \"older\" form of prosopography which was principally concerned with well-known social elites, many of whom were already well-known historical figures. Their genealogies were well-researched, and social webs and kinship linking could be traced, allowing a prosopography of a \"power elite\" to emerge. Prominent examples which Stone drew upon were the work of Charles A. Beard and Sir Lewis Namier. Charles Beard's \"An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States\" (1913) offered an explanation of the form and content of the U.S. Constitution by looking at the class background and economic interests of the Founding Fathers. Sir Lewis Namier produced an equally influential study of the 18th century British House of Commons, and inspired a circle of historians whom Stone light-heartedly termed \"Namier Inc.\" \n\nStone contrasted this older prosopography with what in 1971 was the newer form of quantitative prosopography, which concern was with much wider populations including, particularly, \"ordinary people\". An example of this kind of work, published slightly later, is Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's pioneering work of microhistory, \"Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error\" (1978), which developed a picture of patterns of kinship and heresy, daily and seasonal routine, in a small Occitan village, the last pocket of Cathars, over a 30-year period from 1294 to 1324. Stone anticipated that this new form of prosopography would become dominant as part of a growing wave of Social Science History. But prosopography and other associated forms of social science and quantitative history went into a period of decline during the 1980s. In the 1990s, however, perhaps because of developments in computing, and particularly in database software, prosopography was revived. The \"new prosopography\" has since become clearly established as an important approach in historical research.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22395226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22395226", "title": "Qedarite", "text": "Qedarite\n\nThe Qedarite Kingdom, or Qedar (, \"Mamlakat Qaydar\"), was a largely nomadic, ancient Arab tribal confederation. Described as \"the most organized of the Northern Arabian tribes\", at the peak of its power in the 6th century BCE it had a kingdom and controlled a vast region in Arabia.\n\nBiblical tradition holds that the Qedarites are named for Qedar, the second son of Ishmael, mentioned in the Bible's books of Genesis (25:13) and 1 Chronicles (1:29), where there are also frequent references to Qedar as a tribe. The earliest extrabiblical inscriptions discovered by archaeologists that mention the Qedarites are from the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Spanning the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, they list the names of Qedarite kings who revolted and were defeated in battle, as well as those who paid Assyrian monarchs tribute, including Zabibe, queen of the Arabs (šar-rat KUR.a-ri-bi). There are also Aramaic and Old South Arabian inscriptions recalling the Qedarites, who further appear briefly in the writings of Classical Greek, such as Herodotus, and Roman historians, such as Pliny the Elder, and Diodorus.\n\nIt is unclear when the Qedarites ceased to exist as a separately defined confederation or people. Allies with the Nabataeans, it is likely that they were absorbed into the Nabataean state around the 2nd century CE. In Islam, Isma'il is considered to be the ancestral forefather of the Arab people, and in traditional Islamic historiography, Muslim historians have assigned great importance in their accounts to his first two sons (Nebaioth and Qedar), with the genealogy of Muhammad, the Messenger of God in Islam, alternately assigned to one or the other son, depending on the scholar.\n\nIt has been suggested that the name of the Qedarites is derived from the name for Ishamel's second son Qedar. Though the tribal name is Arabic, it was first transcribed in Assyrian (8th century BCE) and Aramaic (6th century BCE), as the Arabic alphabet had not yet been developed. In the Mareshah onomasticon, the Qedarites are listed as an ethnic group whose name in Aramaic transliteration is \"QDRYN\".\n\nThe Arabic triliteral root \"q-d-r\" means \"to measure, compute, estimate\"; \"to decree, appoint, ordain\"; and \"to have power, or ability.\" \"Qidr\", a noun derived from the same root, means \"cauldron, kettle\", and also gives the verbal derivation, \"to cook\". Ernst Axel Knauf, a biblical scholar who undertook a historical study of the Ishmaelites and determined that they were known in Assyrian inscriptions as the Šumu'il, surmises that the name of the Qedarites was derived from the verb \"qadara\", with its meaning of \"to ordain, to have power\". As this etymology is a deduction based solely on the prominence of the Qedar among the Šumu'il tribes, it is viewed as inconclusive by other scholars.\n\nThe Qedarites were an \"Arab tribal confederation,\" or \"alliance of nomadic Arab tribes.\" According to Philip J. King, theologian and historian, they lived in the northwest Arabian desert and were \"an influential force from the 8th to 4th centuries BCE.\" Geoffrey Bromiley, historical theologist and translator, transcribes their name as \"Kedar\" and states they lived in an area southeast of Damascus and east of the Transjordan.\n\n8th century BCE Assyrian inscriptions place the Qedarites as living in the area to the east of the western border of Babylon. Moving further east into areas of the Transjordan and southern Syria in the 7th century BCE, by the 5th century BCE they had spread into the Sinai and as far as the Nile Delta. Qedarite domination of northwest Arabia involved alliances between the kings of Qedar and the kings of Dedan (Al-`Ula). Historian Israel Eph'al writes that the \"breadth of Qedarite distribution suggests a federation of tribes with various sub-divisions.\"\n\nOases in the largely desert region lived in by the Qedarites - such as Dedan, Tayma, and Dumah - played an important role as sites of settlement, trade, and watering-places. Dumah, a remote desert city to the west, known later as Dumat Al-Jandal and today as al-Jawf, was the most important of these, sitting as it did between the empires of Babylonia and Assyria. Serving as the base for Qedarite religious ceremonies, Dumah's strategic position on the north-south trade route in the area meant that relations with its inhabitants were sought after by both empires, though Dumah and the Qedarites were closer in both geographical and political terms to Babylonia. Those coming from the south and wishing to access Mesopotamia were obliged to pass through Dumah, which also lay on an alternate route to the northwest, leading to the city of Damascus, and from there, on to Assyria and Anatolia.\n\nDuring the period of Persian imperial rule in the region (c. 550–330 BCE), the Qedarites exercised control over the desert areas bordering Egypt and Israel and the traffic related to Arabian incense trade upon which Gaza depended. Herodotus (c. 484–425 BCE) writes of their presence in the northern Sinai near the Egyptian border where they may have been engaged by the Achaemenids, the Persian imperial authorities, to keep that border secure as well as their control of the city of Gaza.\n\nThe first documented mention of Qedar is from a stele (c. 737 BCE) of Tiglath-Pileser III, a king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, that lists leaders from the western part of Mesopotamia that pay him tribute. To the Assyrians, the Qedarites were known as \"Qidri\" or \"qi-id-ri\" with other cuneiform inscriptions also using \"Qadri\", \"Qidarri\", \"Qidari\" and \"Qudari\" (Neo Babylonian). Zabibe (c. 738 BCE) is listed among those paying tribute under the title \"queen of the \"Qidri\" and the \"Aribi\"\" (\"Aribi\" meaning \"Arabs\").\n\nAlso mentioned in Assyrian royal inscriptions is Zabibe's successor Yatie (c. 730 BCE), who sent forces headed by her brother Baasqanu to aid Merodach-Baladan in his bid to hold onto power in Babylon. Together with an army from Elam, this alliance faced the forces of Sennacherib, on the Assyrian king's first campaign in 703 BCE. The events of the battle are recorded in the annals of Sennacherib which describe Yatie as \"queen of the Arabs,\" and tell of the capture of her brother Baasqanu in battle. Israel Eph'al writes that this is the first mention in Assyrian documents of Arabs as an ethnic element in Babylonia.\n\nStatements about the Qedarites in the annals of the Assyrian kings of Ashurbanipal and his son Esarhaddon indicate that the term \"Kedar\" was almost synonymous with \"Arabia\". Hazael, who ruled c. 690–676 BCE, is described as a Qedarite king by Ashurbanipal and \"king of the Arabs\" by Esarhaddon. After Sennacherib's invasion of Babylonia in 691–689 BCE, Hazael fled to Dumah. Dumah is referred to as \"Adummatu\" by the Assyrians, and the city is described by them as the seat of the Qedar confederation and the base of their cult.\n\nTe'elkhunu and Tabua, both referred to as both \"queens of Qidri\" and \"queens of \"Aribi\",\" have \"Adummatu\" explicitly denoted as their seat and capital city in the inscriptions. While the capital city for the three other queens referred to as \"queens of \"Aribi\"\" (Samsi, Zabibe and Yatie) is not explicitly mentioned, it is thought to have been \"Adummatu\" as well. Numerous inscriptions discovered in Dumah itself are further indications for a strong Qedarite presence, one of which asks of three deities known to the Assyrians as gods of Qedar (Ruda, Nuha and Atarsamain) for \"help in the matter of my love.\"\n\nThe conquest of \"Adummatu\" by Sennacherib in 690 BCE and the capture of a Qedarite queen, Te'elkhunu, who was brought back to Assyria with other loot, including divine images, is also mentioned in the annals of the Assyrian monarchs. Esarhaddon eventually returned the \"renewed\" images of the Arab gods to \"Adummatu\" with Tabua, \"who grew up in the palace of Sennacherib,\" and was appointed Qedarite queen by Esarhaddon to replace Te'elkhunu. However, strained relations between the Assyrians and the Qedarites meant that she ruled for only a brief period, with Esarhaddon recognizing Hazael as the king of Qedar after he increased his tribute to the Assyrian monarch by 65 camels. Esarhaddon then appointed Yauta, son of Hazael, as a Qedarite king, following Hazael's death. That Yauta paid a tribute in the form of 10 minas of gold, 1,000 precious stones, 50 camels, and 1,000 leather pouches of aromatics is also recorded.\n\nThe defeat of Ammuladi and Yauta after they mounted Qedarite forces to march against the kings of the Amurru is recorded by Ashurbanipal. Yauta is said to have \"roused the people of Arabia to revolt with him.\" His wife, Adiya, is the only woman mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions as both a Qedarite queen and the wife of a Qedarite king, and is thought to be the only woman who was not a ruler in her own right. The inscriptions record how Adiya was sent by Yauta to accompany Ammuladi and the Qedarite forces, and their subsequent defeat and capture in 604 BCE by the forces of Kamushaltu, king of Moab and a loyal vassal of the Assyrian empire. Yauta is said to have \"fled to the Nabataeans.\" His subsequent capture and sentencing in Nineveh are recorded by Ashurbanipal who relates that, \"I put a dog chain upon him and made him guard a kennel.\" Abiyate was appointed as Yauta's successor, and soon joined with the Nabataeans to revolt against Assyria again, prompting Ashurbanipal to launch a three-month campaign to end it, beginning in Palmyra, continuing on to Damascus and ending in the southern part of al-Leja.\n\nOld South Arabic inscriptions mention \"qdrn\" (\"Qadirān\" or \"Qadrān\") as a person or people. Graffiti found in al-Ula, known as the Graffito of Niran at Dedan, mentions Gashmu I, son of Shahr I, as King of Qedar.\n\nA \"king of Qedar\" is also mentioned in a late 5th century BCE Aramaic inscription on a silver vessel found at Tell Maskhuta in the eastern Nile Delta in lower Egypt. The inscription names him as \"Qainū son of Gashmu,\" with the vessel described as an, \"offering to han-'Ilāt\".\n\nWhile it does not specifically mention the Qedar and is therefore a subject of debate, an Aramaic inscription dating to 5th century BCE discovered on an incense altar at Lachish and dedicated to, \"Iyas, son of Mahaly, the king,\" is interpreted by André Lemaire as a possible reference to kings of Qedar.\n\nHerodotus has documented that the Qedarites were called upon to assist Cambyses II of the Persian empire in his invasion of Egypt in 525 BCE. The Qedarites and Nabataeans were known to enjoy close relations, even engaging as wartime allies against the Assyrians. It is possible that the Qedarites were eventually incorporated into the Nabataean state which emerged as the strongest Ishmaelite presence in northwestern Arabia c. the 2nd century CE. In \"The Cambridge Ancient History\", some of the \"(Arab) Nabataeans\" mentioned by Diodorus in his retelling of events that took place in 312 BCE are said to be Qedarites.\n\nPliny the Elder (23–79 CE), who refers to the \"Cedrei\" and \"Cedareni\" (\"Cedarenes\") in the context of other Arabian tribes, placing their domain to the south of the \"Conchlei\" and adjacent to that of the \"Nabataei\", is thought to be referring to the Qedar. Jerome (c. 357–420 CE), also writing in Latin, transcribes Qedar as \"Cedar\", and refers to it as a region. In one entry, he describes it as, \"a region of the Saracens, who are called Ishmaelites in scripture\"; in another, he writes that it was a \"once uninhabitable region across Saracen Arabia\"; and in a third, he writes that it is a \"deserted region of the Ishmaelites, whom they now call Saracens.\" According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Theodoret (c. 393 – c. 457) mentions that in his time, the Qedar lived near Babylon.\n\nThere are brief references to the Qedar in the writings of Western travellers to the Levant in the 19th century. Drawing on biblical motfis, comparisons are made between the Bedouins and the Qedar. For example, Albert Augustus Isaacs describes the imposing spectacle of a Bedouin encampment on a plain upon which, \"the black tents of Kedar were spread far and wide.\" An earlier account by Charles Boileau Elliot describes the Arabs as falling into two main groups, Fellahs and Bedouins, and identifies the latter with Ishmael and the Qedar as follows:[...] the Bedouins still retain the wandering habits of their father Ishmael; their 'hand is against every man, and every man's hand is against' them; the wild desert is their home; the ground their pallet and their canopy the sky; or, if luxurious their choicest place of sojourn is a little tent 'black as the tents of Kedar' their progenitor [...]\n\nCharles Forster identifies the Arab tribe of the Beni Harb as the modern descendants of the Kedar. He proposes that Beni Harb (\"sons of war\") is a patronym and nom de guerre that was adopted by the tribe at least 2,000 years ago, replacing Kedar as the national moniker.\n\nThe descendants of Abraham and Hagar are called Ishmaelites, after Ishmael, their firstborn, and the Qedarites are named for his second son, Qedar. The Bible refers to both the Qedarites and Qedar frequently. Old Testament references include Genesis (25:13), Isaiah (21:16-17, 42:11, 60:7), Jeremiah (2:10, 49:28-33), Ezekiel (27:21), and Chronicles (1:29). Twice, Qedar is used to refer to the actual son of Ishmael, as in the books of Genesis and Chronicles, while remaining references are to his descendants, referring either to his most prominent North Arabian sons, or to the Arabs and Bedouins as a more general collective. The \"tents of Kedar\" equated with \"the peace-hating Meshech\" mentioned in the Book of Psalms (120:5) were likely a Qedarite sub-group.\n\nIn Canticles (1:5), the tents of the Qedarites are described as black: \"Black I am, but beautiful, ye daughters of Jerusalem / As tents of Qedar, as tentcloth of Salam black.\" Their tents are said to be made of black goat hair. A tribe of Salam was located just south of the Nabateans in Madain Salih, and Knauf proposed that the Qedarites mentioned in this Masoretic text were in fact Nabataeans and played a crucial role in the spice trade in the 3rd century BCE.\n\nBiblical descriptions indicate there were two major types of Qedarites: nomads (Arabic: \"wabariya\") living in tents and sedentary people (Arabic:\"ḥaḍariya\") living in villages. Jeremiah describes them as \"a nation at ease, that dwells securely\" (49:31) and notes that they engage in the pagan practice of shaving their temples. Isaiah recalls their warrior activities and skill with the bow. (21:16f) Ezekiel associates, \"Arabia and all the princes of Kedar,\" and indicates that they engaged in sheep/goat trading with the Phoenicians. The three books list the flocks of the Qedarites as including lambs, rams, goats and camels.\n\nJeremiah also tells of a campaign by Nebuchadnezzar (630–562 BCE) against the Qedarites during the Babylonian period. Gashmu, the king of the Qedarites mentioned in the 5th century BCE Aramaic inscription described above, is also referred to as \"Geshem the Arab\" or \"Geshem the Arabian\" by Nehemiah who lists him as one of his adversaries, since Gashmu stands opposed to Nehemiah's governorship over Judea in 447 BCE.\n\nBiblical and extrabiblical evidence suggests that of the Arabian tribes, the Qedarites were most prominent in their contacts with the world outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Like other nomadic groups, they lived primarily in unfortified encampments. Pastoralists and traders in livestock, such as male lambs, rams and goats, they also played a key role in the prosperity of Gaza's incense trade, controlling traffic in the desert regions between Egypt and Palestine. As a result of their trading activities, there were clans from among the Qedarites that became wealthy.\n\nThough they were vassals under Assyrian rule and were often engaged in rebellion against that empire, the rise to dominance of the Persian empire proved beneficial to the Qedarites. Qedarite control of the trade routes and the access they afforded the Persians translated into what Herodotus described as a friendly relationship.\n\nThe Qedarites are among a number of North Arabian tribes whose interactions with Arameaen tribes beginning in the 8th century BCE resulted in cultural exchanges between these two large Semitic groups. Early Arab tribal groups like the Qedarites spoke Old Arabic, but as the Arabic alphabet had not yet been developed, they used the Aramaic alphabet to write. \"The tongue of Kedar\" is used in rabbinical sources as a name for the Arabic language.\n\nPapponymy, the practice of naming boys after their grandfathers, was common among the Qedar. Some Qedarites had Aramaic personal names (e.g. Hazael or \"Haza-el\"), while others had Arabic personal names (e.g. Gashmu and Zabibe). Aramaic civilization and its peoples were gradually absorbed by the Arabs with Arabic dialects in Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq in particular exhibiting the influence of Aramaic.\n\nReligious worship among the Qedar, as was the case for most of the inhabitants of Arabia until the 7th century CE, was polytheistic. Its practices and beliefs included an emphasis on female idols and worshippers. Divine images of the gods and goddesses worshipped by Qedarite Arabs, as noted in Assyrian inscriptions, included representations of Atarsamain, Nuha, Ruda, Daa, Abirillu, and Atarquruma. The female guardian of these idols, usually the reigning queen, served as a priestess (\"apkallatu\", in Assyrian texts) who communed with the other world. As mentioned above, there is also evidence that the Qedar worshipped Al-lāt, to whom the inscription on a silver bowl from a king of Qedar is dedicated. In the Babylonian Talmud, which was passed down orally for centuries before being transcribed c. 500 CE, in tractate Taanis (folio 5b), it is said that most Qedarites worshipped pagan gods .\n\nThere is a mausoleum assigned to Qedar in Qeydar city, Zanjan Province, Iran.\n\nThe biblical view of the late Iron Age political and cultural map describes it as a set of branching genealogies. Biblical figures three generations forward from Terah are invariably described as the eponymous founders of different tribes and polities that interacted with the Kingdom of Judah between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. Such is the case of the Qedarite Arabs, who according to biblical tradition, are the offspring of the Abraham-Ishmael-Kedar genealogical line.\nThe majority of Sayyid believe they are one of the modern day descendants of Muhammad, and that they are therefore the descendants of Ishmael and his second son Qedar. Abu Ja'far al-Baqir (676–743 CE) wrote that his father Ali ibn Husayn informed him that Mohammed had said: \"The first whose tongue spoke in clear Arabic was Ishmael, when he was fourteen years old.\" Hisham Ibn Muhammad al-Kalbi (737–819 CE) established a genealogical link between Ishmael and Mohammed using writings that drew on biblical and Palmyran sources, and the ancient oral traditions of the Arabs. His book, \"Jamharat al-Nasab\" (\"The Abundance of Kinship\"), seems to posit that the people known as \"Arabs\" are all descendants of Ishmael. Ibn Kathir (1301–1373) writes, \"All the Arabs of the Hijaz are descendants of Nebaioth(Nubia,Sudan) and Qedar.\" Medieval Jewish sources also usually identified Qedar with Arabs and/or Muslims. According to author and scholar Irfan Shahîd, Western scholars viewed this kind of \"genealogical Ishmaelism\" with suspicion, seeing it as, [...] a late Islamic fabrication because of the confusion in Islamic times which made it such a capacious term as to include the inhabitants of the south as well as the north of the Arabian Peninsula. But shorn of this extravagance, the concept is much more modest in its denotation, and in the sober sources it applies only to certain groups among the Arabs of pre-Islamic times. Some important statements to this effect were made by Muhammed when he identified some Arabs as Ishmaelites and others as not. Ishmaelism in this more limited definition holds that Ishmael was both an important religious figure and eponymous ancestor for some of the Arabs of western Arabia. Prominence is given in Arab genealogical accounts to the first two of Ishmael's twelve sons, Nebaioth (, \"Nabīt\") and Qedar (, \"Qaydār\"), who are also prominently featured in the Genesis account. It is likely that they and their tribes lived in northwestern Arabia and were historically the most important of the twelve Ishamelite tribes.\n\nIn accounts tracing the ancestry of Mohammed back to Ma'ad (and from there to Adam), Arab scholars alternate, with some citing the line as through Nebaioth, others Qedar.\n\n\n"}

The Supreme Court noted that when the British North America Act was originally adopted, there were \"few, if any\" Inuit in Canada, which was then a much smaller country. However, the Constitution always left open the possibility of joining Canada with other lands, and thus the Inuit in Rupert's Land were now within Quebec's borders.\n\nThe federal government at the time of this case did not want to take responsibility over the Inuit. It argued that the term \"Indians\" as defined by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 would not include the Inuit, and that this document could be used to help interpret the British North America Act.\n\nChief Justice Lyman P. Duff, in his opinion, consulted what he believed to be \"the most authoritative\" evidence, namely evidence from the Hudson's Bay Company which governed Rupert's Land. A British House of Commons committee examined how the company dealt with the Inuit in 1856 and 1857. The Hudson's Bay Company prepared a report for the committee, and as Duff noted, the report referred to Inuit as a type of \"Indian.\" Later, after the British North America Act was adopted, the Parliament of Canada declared in December 1867 that if it gained jurisdiction over Rupert's Land, it would take responsibility for the Indians there. In 1870, the territories were awarded to Canada.\n\nDuff then added that the Inuit of Labrador, as well, had been widely referred to as Indians from around 1760 and were when the British North America Act was adopted. Official records from 1762 called Inuit \"savages\", and Duff compared this to how Indian tribes such as the Montagnais and Huron were called savages. In 1869, a judge from the Court of Labrador prepared a report for the Governor of Newfoundland which referred to \"Esquimaux\" (Inuit) as a type of Indian. Duff also found some missionaries referred to Inuit as Indians. In this context, Duff found it important that in 1879, Sir John A. Macdonald, one of the chief negotiators of the British North America Act and Prime Minister of Canada, discussed the Inuit with Sir Hector Langevin, and the discussion referenced the Inuit as Indians.\n\nAs defined by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, Indians are \"the several nations or tribes of Indian with whom We are connected and who lived under Our protection.\" The federal government argued this would not include the Inuit, as the words \"nations\" and \"tribes\" were not used to describe Inuit communities. However, Duff found evidence contradicting this. Duff also said the Inuit under the Hudson's Bay Company to an extent lived under the \"protection\" of the Crown, \"under either charter or license from the Crown.\" Duff also doubted that the Royal Proclamation of 1763 could guide interpretation of the British North America Act.\n\nJustices Albert Hudson and Henry Hague Davis each wrote brief opinions concurring with Duff.\n\nJustice Cannon wrote his own opinion finding the Inuit should be considered Indians. He noted the report by Sir George Simpson in 1857 calling Inuit Indians. Cannon then concluded, \"the report of the Committee must have been known to the Legislature at Westminster in 1867.\" He also pointed to the Quebec Conference of 1864, in which Resolution 29(29) of the Quebec Resolutions declaring the (Federal) Parliament should govern \"Indians and Lands reserved for the Indians,\" in which the latter term was translated into French as \"Les Sauvages et les terres réservées pour les Sauvages.\" This meant all natives in British North America, including Newfoundland.\n\nJustice Patrick Kerwin also wrote an opinion finding that Inuit were Indians. He felt the British North America Act, in referring to Indians, was intended to mean Aboriginals. He noted evidence that Samuel de Champlain, missionaries and others classified Indians as \"sauvages\" and Inuit as \"sauvages esquimaux.\" Books which Kerwin speculated that the Fathers of Confederation and the British Parliament in 1867 might have seen also used this classification. Editions of Webster's Dictionary from 1913 and the 1920s did not count the Inuit as Indians, but earlier dictionaries did.\n\nJustice Oswald Smith Crocket wrote an opinion briefly concurring with Justices Cannon and Kerwin.\n\n"}

It followed the church's sesquicentennial reenactments of Mormon pioneer wagon trains 1997.\n\nThe events for Sea Trek 2001 were in two stages. The first, called \"The Gathering\", was a tour of tall ships through different European sea ports over a seventeen-day period. Eight sailing ships were rented: the \"Statsraad Lehmkuhl\", \"Christian Radich\", and \"Sorlandet\" from Norway; the \"Europa\", \"Swan fan Makkum\", and \"Antigua\" from Denmark; the \"Mir\" from Russia; and the \"Mary-Anne\" from Germany. They departed from Esberg, Denmark on August 7, 2001 and stopped at ports in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Scotland, and England, where Mormon emigrants had departed in the nineteenth century. Identical statues were donated to a number of port cities visited during the project.

{"id": "16985144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16985144", "title": "Semi-periphery countries", "text": "Semi-periphery countries\n\nIn world-systems theory, the semi-periphery countries (sometimes referred to as just the semi-periphery) are the industrializing, mostly capitalist countries which are positioned between the periphery and core countries. Semi-periphery countries have organizational characteristics of both core countries and periphery countries and are often geographically located between core and peripheral regions as well as between two or more competing core regions. Semi-periphery regions play a major role in mediating economic, political, and social activities that link core and peripheral areas.\n\nThese regions allow for the possibility of innovative technology, reforms in social and organizational structure, and dominance over peripheral nations. These changes can lead to a semi-periphery country being promoted to a core nation. Semi-periphery is, however, more than a description, as it also serves as a position within the world hierarchy in which social and economic change can be interpreted.\n\nWorld-systems theory describes the semi-periphery as a key structural element in the world economy. The semi-periphery plays a vital role comparative to that of the role that Spain and Portugal played in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as intermediate trading groups within the European colonial empire.\n\nToday, the semi-periphery is generally industrialized. Semi-peripheral countries contribute to the manufacturing and exportation of a variety of goods. They are marked by above average land mass, as exemplified by Argentina, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, and Iran. More land mass typically means an increased market size and share. Semi-peripheral nations are not all large though, as smaller countries such as Israel, Poland, and Greece exist within the semi-periphery.\n\nSemi-peripheral countries offer their citizens relatively diverse economic opportunities but also have extreme gaps between the rich and poor. World-system theorists originally used only two categories: periphery countries and core countries. A need for an in between category became quickly apparent, leading to the establishment of the semi-periphery category for societies that have moved away from the periphery but have not become core. In other words, the category describes societies that remain dependent, and to some extent underdeveloped, despite having achieved significant levels of industrialization. Semi-peripheral countries are tied into dynamic world systems that focus on the reliance of poor nations upon the wealthy, a concept known as the dependency theory. The term semi-periphery has been applied to countries that existed as early as in the thirteenth century. In theory, the creation of a semi-periphery category has added sociological and historical layers to previous developmental theories—yet it still has similar, inherently capitalist foundations.\n\nThe semi periphery is needed to stabilize the world system, as it facilitates interaction and provides a connection between the low-income peripheral states and the high-income core states by adding another step in the world system hierarchy. As the middle ground, semi-peripheral countries display characteristics of both the core and the periphery. They also serve as a political buffer zone in that while they are exploited, they are also the exploiters. These areas have either been core regions in the past or formerly-peripheral areas that have since advanced in the world economy.\n\nSemi-peripheral nations are a necessary structural element in a world-trade system, since such nations can serve to alleviate the political pressures that the core can exert upon the periphery and the political unrest that the periphery can direct back at the core. On the other hand, the semi-periphery can find itself excluded from the region's politics, as it lies just outside the bounds of political arena of the core states.\n\nThe semi-periphery exists because it needs to divide the economic power between the core and the periphery. Semi-periphery, referred to as the middle class by Wallerstein, is what makes the capitalist world function because it is much like the sociological structural functionalism theory, where norms, customs, traditions, and institutions act as \"organs\" that work toward the proper functioning of the \"body\" as a whole. Without these industrializing countries, change will never reach the periphery.\n\nIn terms of their contribution to industry and economy, the contemporary semi-peripheral states are semi-industrialized. Semi-peripheral countries are major exporters of minerals and agricultural goods. They are often focused in the manufacturing and exportation of industrial goods and commodities. While these advances separate the semi-periphery from the periphery, they lack the power and the economic dominance of core nations and still have a lot of un-managed poverty, placing them beneath the core. Semi-peripheral countries are important contributors to the world economy because of the above reasons and because they tend to have above average land mass, meaning that they are host to an above average market. A primary example is China, a country with not only a large area but with a booming population.\n\nThis era of human history found the semi-periphery concentrated in the area stretching from the Middle East to China, including India and the Mongol Empire. This was the first time in history that the peripheries and semi-peripheries of the world became connected and involved in the trade of the world, both with cores and with each other. Through a lucrative trade system, including heavy taxing of goods traveling through their borders, they were able to maintain a steady stream of wealth, becoming the driving forces of economic change throughout this time period. In addition, a heavy emphasis on defense and border security, particularly among the Mongols, allowed them to be fairly impenetrable trade obstacles. Geography also played a role, as seen in India's development of an impressive maritime industry. Because of its position along a convenient route through the Indian Ocean, India established its role as a \"hinge\" between the East and West. Through their positions within the world trade system, semi-peripheries in the Middle East became crucially important in connecting the cities of Chinese and Indian cores with the fledgling cities of Europe, as well as serving as key points between other, more major core cities in the region, such as Baghdad, Cairo, and Aden.\n\nFollowing increases in population and commerce in Western Europe in the thirteenth century, the feudal system met severe economic difficulties in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. This decline in development was caused by a combination of the decline in agricultural production, the shrinking economy that had already hit its peak within the current feudal structure, and the devastating effects of the Black Plague epidemic. The regression of Western Europe into the semi-periphery and periphery allowed for the rise of the trading powers of Italy, most notably Genoa and Venice. These Italian city-states took advantage of their established trade connections with the Mongol Empire, the Far East, the Middle East, and the other Mediterranean powers to maintain their growth despite the economic failures of their European trade partners. Genoa and Venice had influence beyond their trade channels. Both were instrumental in the Crusades through their provisions of troops, transport vessels, and naval ships. Genoa also assisted the Byzantine Empire when it helped recapture the capital, Constantinople, in the late thirteenth century. The Byzantine Empire took advantage of its strategic position along various trade routes and the decline of Western Europe to rise to core status until its fall in 1453.\n\nDuring this time period, Genoa and Venice developed forms of laissez-faire government and institutions that are viewed as precursors to modern capitalism. Despite these advances in influence and entrepreneurship, Genoa and Venice suffered from the crippling effects of the Black Plague, as much of the rest of Europe had before them. Venice was able to survive due to its connection with the Southern trade route, though her strength was much reduced by the middle of the fifteenth century. Genoa never fully recovered from the Black Death and its defeat at the hands of Venice in the late fourteenth century. The decline of Genoa and the shift in Venice's focus to the Red Sea trade route left the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic open to Portugal and Spain, who were already better positioned geographically to control Atlantic trade routes.\n\nIn a push to ensure stable economic growth, Europe turned to a capitalistic economy in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries to replace the failed feudal system. Modern capitalism allowed for economies to extend beyond geographical and political boundaries, leading to the formation of the first worldwide economic system. At the base of this world system was an international division of labor that determined countries' relationships and placement within the categories of the world system: core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external. The core regions, most notably the countries of Northwestern Europe like England, France, and the Netherlands, gained the most from the world economy. Their ascension from previous peripheral and semi-peripheral status to the core was driven by the development of strong central government and military power, the combination of which made possible control of international commerce and exploitation of colonial possessions.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum was the periphery, marked by lack of central government, exportation of raw materials to the core, and exploitive labor practices. In this time period, especially toward the end of the 17th century, South America and parts of North America stood out as peripheral zones under the control and capitalistic exploitation of core countries in Europe. Slaves and indigenous workers in these regions developed raw materials for export to Europe, a distinctive characteristic of the new capitalism, as goods were no longer produced solely for internal consumption. The aristocracy of these regions controlled commerce and became wealthy through the new world economy, leading to their rise in power above the government. Even in periods of upheaval, local aristocrats were able to rely on core European powers to assist in keeping control over the economic system.\n\nIn between the core and periphery was the semi-periphery, which constituted both previous core regions that had declined, like Italy, Spain and Portugal, and peripheries that had improved their position, like southern Germany and southern France. Spain and Portugal had taken advantage of the opening to Atlantic control left by the decline of Italian powers like Genoa and Venice. Much like the core European powers, Spain and Portugal had strong navies and expansive colonial domains, which they exploited for their natural resources and cheap labor. Rather than using the increased wealth to develop strong domestic manufacturing sectors, as other Western European powers did, Spain and Portugal used imported gold and silver to obtain manufactured goods from the core countries, relegating them to semi-periphery instead of core status. So, while they had control over several peripheral regions and exploited them, a characteristic of a core region, these countries failed to develop the quality manufacturing industries and the access to international banking that further defined core countries, leaving them a step below in the world system at semi-periphery status.\n\nThe development of trade between Europe, the Americas, and the East generated massive profits for a relatively small merchant elite in the European colonial powers. These merchants were able to utilize their profits to take control of agriculture and other industries. The merchant class further consolidated its power by extending control over internal markets and the prices of finished goods. The end result was the development of the necessary capital to industrialize the European core states.\n\nThis era was defined by the transition from agriculture to industrialization. The rapid development of industry triggered several reactions. Many European states explored new territories in addition to their original colonial holdings for new markets to exploit. The European world system continued to expand and include more regions, as it absorbed the Indian Ocean economic system through the acquisition of colonies by Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, among others. Previously isolated regions, like much of the American interior zone, joined newly independent South American countries in becoming part of the periphery. By the nineteenth century, Asia and Africa had also entered the world system as peripheral regions. This development of Africa and Asia as peripheral continents allowed for new cores like the United States and Germany to improve their core status, rising higher within the world system.\n\nThroughout this time period was a constant shift within core regions from a combination of agriculture and industry to solely industrial enterprise. In this period, England was the leader in industrial and agricultural production, though by 1900, only ten percent of England's populace worked in agriculture, demonstrating the shift to industry not only in England but across the core stratum. The dramatic shift to industry extended beyond the core by the end of this time period, as core regions encouraged the development of manufacturing in peripheral and semi-peripheral zones to further develop those markets and create demand for newly developed machines and other goods.\n\n The West represented both the core and the semi-periphery, as Europe dominated 80% of the world's market share. Much of the rest of the world was a diverse periphery, though Japan was a notable exception. As expansionism continued, new core nations emerged, such as the Britain, Germany, and the United States, while old cores such as Spain and Portugal faded to the semi-periphery. The growth of the power of the common man led to an expansion of thought concerning democracy, communism, and revolution, which pervaded the weaker semi-peripheral nations overcome with civil distress. In some cases, this led to the weakening of the nations, such as the violent revolution in France. This contributed to the adoption of totalitarian leaders, as seen in Germany and France. The major factors contributing to world war were the conflicts and power struggles taking place between the three classes of nations in the global system. Nations considered part of the semi-periphery felt oppressed by the stronger, larger core nations.\n\nThis trend known to continued throughout the century, with Germany, Russia, and Japan also taking seats at the core. At the end of World War II however, Germany quickly fell to the semi-periphery along with war-ravaged France. As the rest of Europe struggled to rebuild itself, it also fell to the semi-periphery, with the exception of many Eastern European nations, who fell under the Soviet Union as bloc countries. Japan also fell back into semi-periphery, along with the industrializing China and India, until their recent upswing in influence. Change also came to North America, where American imperialism led to the rise of countries like Guatemala and the Dominican Republic. On the other side of the Pacific, Australia was also developing, helping to secure an Allied Victory in World War II.\n\nIn today's global hierarchy, some states are transitioning upward while others are moving downward in terms of status and influence. Former colonial powers no longer exercise control over an international domain and are instead mostly relegated to their core; for example, former European world powers do not exert influence over colonial outposts in the Americas, Africa, or Asia, but rather have consolidated their power in the form of the European Union. The new leading powers are mostly non-European (United States, Canada, Japan). Outside of these developed countries are countries (see list below) that are considered semi-periphery and are both dominant and dominated within economic, political, and social realms. These middle powers are a combination of nations that have emerged as a result of the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and nations that have risen because of their possession of resources in high demand, like oil in Saudi Arabia. While these nations are by no means on the level of the stated world powers, they are able to exert influence over the weaker nations of the impoverished Fourth World.\n\nOther terms used to describe semi-periphery countries include sub-imperial and semi-industrial. Immanuel Wallerstein identifies three ways by which countries can emerge from the periphery into the semi-periphery. Countries with a large market and room for industrial growth, like Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico, and countries with valuable energy resources, like Iran and Saudi Arabia, can utilize the strategy of seizing the chance. The strategy of promotion by invitation can be utilized by countries willing to be open to foreign governmental and regional administrative centers. Examples of past countries to utilize this strategy are the capitalist regimes in Africa like Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Zaire, Senegal, and Côte d'Ivoire. These countries use dependent development to integrate into the world economy and establish local dominance. Outside of these strategies is that of self-reliance, a basic theory that as some countries grow, others will decline. Many countries in Africa and South America have exhibited the qualities of a sub-imperial or semi-industrial power.\n\nWallerstein examines the role of semi-periphery countries during a period of economic downturn. To redefine core and periphery countries in an economic sense, core countries are characterized by advanced technology, high profits, high wages, and diversified production while periphery countries have less technology, low profits, low wages, and less diversified production. Semi-periphery countries fall in the middle of these spectra, and their unique political and social structure place them in a position where they can best take advantage of economic downturns.\n\nThese economic downturns occur because of increased supply and decreased demand, which combine to create a shift in surplus and power to the semi-periphery. Semi-periphery regions take advantage of the situation by expanding control of their home markets and the surrounding periphery countries at the expense of core countries. The underlying reason for this shift in power lies in the basic economic principle of scarcity. As long as core countries maintain scarcities of their goods, they can select customers from semi-periphery and periphery countries that are competing over them. When excess supply occurs, the core countries are the ones competing over a smaller market. This competition allows semi-peripheral nations to select from among core countries rather than vice versa when making decisions about commodity purchases, manufacturing investments, and sales of goods, shifting the balance of power to the semi-periphery. While in general there is a power shift from core to semi-periphery in times of economic struggles, there are few examples of semi-peripheral countries transitioning to core status. To accomplish this, semi-peripheral nations must not only take advantage of weaker core countries but must also exploit any existing advantages over other semi-peripheral nations. How well they exploit these advantages determines their arrangement within the semi-periphery class.\n\nThe semi-peripheral nations of the world have played an important role to world trade and interaction since early periods of globalized trade. This \"middle ground\" between the very powerful cores and the backwaters of the far periphery allowed those two zones to interact with greater ease. For example, during the 13th-century world system, the semi-periphery areas around Europe's Mediterranean Coast facilitated trade between the peripheries of the more manufacturing based Northern Europe and the cores of India and China. John Markoff, a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh, also notes that political developments, particularly in the advancement of democracy, originate in the semi-periphery. He notes that innovations in democracy came from the semi-periphery rather than the more established, stable core nations, where profit discourages great reform, or the extremely poor periphery where instability makes reform too dangerous to attempt. It has been within semi-peripheral nations where democratic reforms like the expansion of suffrage and the institution of the secret ballot have been implemented.\n\nThe following are semi-periphery countries according to Wallerstein (1976).\n\nThe following are semi-periphery countries from an updated version of essays by Wallerstein (1997).\n\nThe following are semi-periphery countries according to Dunn, Kawana, Brewer (2000).\n\nAnd this is the semi-periphery listing according to Babones (2005), who notes that this list is composed of countries that \"have been consistently classified into a single one of the three zones [core, semi-periphery or periphery] of the world economy over the entire 28-year study period\".\n\n\n\n"}
