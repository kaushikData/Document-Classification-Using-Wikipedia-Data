The main riot on 11 April, dubbed \"Bloody Saturday\" by \"Time\" magazine, resulted in almost 280 injuries to police and 45 injuries to members of the public; over a hundred vehicles were burned, including 56 police vehicles; and almost 150 buildings were damaged, with thirty burned. There were 82 arrests. Reports suggested that up to 5,000 people were involved.\n\nBrixton in South London was an area with serious social and economic problems. The whole United Kingdom was affected by a recession by 1981, but the local African-Caribbean community was suffering particularly high unemployment, poor housing, and a higher than average crime rate.\n\nIn the preceding months there had been growing unease between the police and the inhabitants of Lambeth. On 18 January 1981 a number of black youths died in a fire during a house party in New Cross. Although authorities have claimed it may have been accidental and that the fire started from inside the house, it was widely suspected to have been a racially motivated arson attack by someone outside the property, and the police investigation was criticised as inadequate for not exploring that possibility. Black activists, including Darcus Howe, organised a march for the \"Black People's Day of Action\" on 2 March. Accounts of turnout vary from 5,000 to 20,000 to 25,000. The marchers walked 17 miles from Deptford to Hyde Park, passing the Houses of Parliament and Fleet Street. While the majority of the march finished in Hyde Park without incident, there was some confrontation with police at Blackfriars. Les Back wrote that \"While the local press reported the march respectfully, the national papers unloaded the full weight of racial stereotyping.\" \"The Evening Standard\"s front-page headline was a photo of a policeman with a bloody face next to a quote from Darcus Howe referring to the march as \"A good day\". A few weeks later, some of the organizers of the march were arrested, charged with the offence of \"Riot\". They were later acquitted.\n\nIn 1980 the number of crimes recorded in the Lambeth Borough was 30,805. The Brixton Division was responsible for 10,626 of those crimes. Between 1976 and 1980 Brixton accounted for 35% of all crimes in the Borough, but 49% of all robbery and violent theft offences. The police recognised that there was a problem and that they needed a solution to a growing crime trend. Robbery and violent crime was on the increase. At the beginning of April, the Metropolitan Police began \"Operation Swamp 81\", a plainclothes operation to reduce crime and uniformed patrols were increased in the area. Officers from other Metropolitan police districts and the Special Patrol Group were dispatched into Brixton, and within five days, 943 people were stopped and searched, and 82 arrested, through the heavy use of what was colloquially known as the \"Sus law.\" This referred to powers under the Vagrancy Act 1824, which allowed police to search and arrest members of the public when it was believed that they were acting suspiciously, and not necessarily committing a crime. The African-Caribbean community claimed that the police were disproportionately using these powers against black people.\n\nPublic disfavour came to a head on Friday 10 April. At around 5:15pm a police constable spotted a black youth named Michael Bailey running towards him, apparently away from three other black youths. Bailey was stopped and found to be badly bleeding, but broke away from the constable. Stopped again on Atlantic Road, Bailey was found to have a four-inch stab wound. Bailey ran into a flat and was helped by a family and the police constable there by putting kitchen roll on his wound. A crowd gathered and, as the police then tried to take the wounded boy to a waiting minicab on Railton Road, the crowd tried to intervene thinking the police did not appear to be providing or seeking the medical help Bailey needed quickly enough. As the minicab pulled away at speed a police car arrived and stopped the cab. When an officer from the police car realised Bailey was injured he moved him into the back of the police car to take him to hospital more quickly, and bound his wound more tightly to stop the bleeding. A group of 50 youths began to shout for Bailey's release thinking the police were arresting him. \"Look, they’re killing him,\" claimed one. The crowd descended on the police car and pulled him out although the officers were trying to take him to hospital. The youths dispatched him to hospital and told officers: \"Let us look after our own.\"\n\nRumours spread that a youth had been left to die by the police, or that the police looked on as the stabbed youth was lying on the street. Over 200 youths, black and white with predominantly Afro-Caribbean heritage reportedly turned on the police. In response the police decided to increase the number of police foot patrols in Railton Road, despite the tensions, and carry on with \"Operation Swamp 81\" throughout the night and into the following day.\n\nIt was believed by the local community that the stabbed youth died as a result of police brutality, fuelling tensions throughout the day as crowds slowly gathered. Tensions first erupted around 4pm, as two police officers stopped and searched a mini cab in Railton Road. By this time Brixton Road (Brixton High Street) was reportedly filled with angry people and police cars were pelted with bricks. At around 5pm the tension escalated and spread, and the 9pm BBC News bulletin that evening reported 46 police officers injured, five seriously. Shops were looted on Railton Road, Mayall Road, Leeson Road, Acre Lane and Brixton Road. The looting in Brixton reportedly started at around 6pm. At 6.15pm the fire brigade received their first call, as a police van was set on fire by rioters in Railton Road, with the fire brigade being warned \"riot in progress\". As the fire brigade approached the police cordon, they were waved through without warning, driving down Railton Road towards 300 youths armed with bottles and bricks. The fire brigade met the crowd at the junction between Railton Road and Shakespeare Road and were attacked with stones and bottles.\n\nThe police put out emergency calls to police officers across London, asking for assistance. They had no strategy, and only had inadequate helmets and non-fireproof plastic shields to protect themselves with while clearing the streets of rioters. The police reportedly also had difficulties in radio communication. The police proceeded in clearing the Atlantic-Railton-Mayall area by pushing the rioters down the road, forming deep shield walls. The rioters responded with bricks, bottles, and petrol bombs.\n\nAt 5.30pm the violence further escalated. Non-rioting members of the public attempted to mediate between the police and the rioters, calling for a de-escalation by withdrawing police out of the area. The destructive efforts of the rioters peaked at around 8pm, as those attempts at mediation failed. Two pubs, 26 businesses, schools and other structures were set alight as rioters went on a rampage. Hundreds of local residents were trapped in their houses, locked in by either police or rioters.\n\nBy 9.30pm, over 1,000 police were dispatched into Brixton, squeezing out the rioters. By 1am on 12 April 1981, the area was largely subdued, with no large groups – except the police – on the streets. The fire brigade refused to return until the following morning. Police numbers grew to over 2,500, and by the early hours of Sunday morning the rioting had fizzled out.\n\nDuring the disturbances, 299 police were injured, along with at least 65 members of the public. 61 private vehicles and 56 police vehicles were destroyed. 28 premises were burned and another 117 damaged and looted. 82 arrests were made.\n\nBetween 3 and 11 July of that year, there was more unrest fuelled by racial and social discord, at Handsworth in Birmingham, Southall in London, Toxteth in Liverpool, Hyson Green in Nottingham and Moss Side in Manchester. There were also smaller pockets of unrest in Leeds, Leicester, Southampton, Halifax, Bedford, Gloucester, Wolverhampton, Coventry, Bristol, and Edinburgh. Racial tension played a major part in most of these disturbances, although all of the riots took place in areas hit particularly hard by unemployment and recession.\n\nThe Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, commissioned a public inquiry into the riot headed by Lord Scarman. The Scarman report was published by Susana De Freitas on 25 November 1981.\n\nScarman found unquestionable evidence of the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of 'stop and search' powers by the police against black people. As a consequence, a new code for police behaviour was put forward in the \"Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984\"; and the act also created an independent Police Complaints Authority, established in 1985, to attempt to restore public confidence in the police. Scarman concluded that \"complex political, social and economic factors [created a] disposition towards violent protest\".\n\nThe 1999 Macpherson Report, an investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and the failure of the police to establish sufficient evidence for the prosecution of the charged suspects, found that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report had been ignored. The report concluded that the police force was \"institutionally racist\". This report, which did not cover the events of the Brixton Riots, disagreed with the conclusions made by Scarman.\n\nOn 25 March 2011, BBC Radio 4 broadcast reminiscences of participants including police and black Brixton residents.\n\nOn 13 April, Margaret Thatcher dismissed the notion that unemployment and racism lay beneath the Brixton disturbances claiming \"Nothing, but nothing, justifies what happened\" – although figures showed high unemployment amongst Brixton's black population. Overall unemployment in Brixton stood at 13 percent, with 25.4 percent for ethnic minorities. Unemployment among black youths was estimated at 55 percent. Rejecting increased investment in Britain's inner cities, Thatcher added, \"Money cannot buy either trust or racial harmony.\" Lambeth London Borough Council leader, Ted Knight, complained that the police presence \"amounted to an army of occupation\" that provoked the riots; Thatcher responded, \"What absolute nonsense and what an appalling remark ... No one should condone violence. No one should condone the events ... They were criminal, criminal.\"\n\nSmall-scale disturbances continued to simmer throughout the summer. After four nights of rioting in Liverpool during the Toxteth riots, beginning 4 July, there were 150 buildings burnt and 781 police officers injured. CS gas was deployed for the first time on the British mainland to quell the rioting. On 10 July, there was fresh rioting in Brixton. It was not until the end of July that the disturbances began to subside.\n\nThe recommendations of the Scarman Report to tackle the problems of racial disadvantage and inner-city decline were not implemented and rioting would break out again in the 1985 and 1995 Brixton riots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2071225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071225", "title": "Architectural conservation", "text": "Architectural conservation\n\nArchitectural conservation describes the process through which the material, historical, and design integrity of any built heritage are prolonged through carefully planned interventions. The individual engaged in this pursuit is known as an architectural conservator-restorer. Decisions of when and how to engage in an intervention are critical to the ultimate conservation-restoration of cultural heritage. Ultimately, the decision is value based: a combination of artistic, contextual, and informational values is normally considered. In some cases, a decision to not intervene may be the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe Preservation Architect must consider factors that deal with issues of prolonging the life and preserving the integrity of architectural character, such as form and style, and/or its constituent materials, such as stone, brick, glass, metal, and wood. In this sense, the term refers to the \"professional use of a combination of science, art, craft, and technology as a preservation tool\" and is allied with - and often equated to - its parent fields, of historic environment conservation and art conservation.\n\nIn addition to the design and art/science definition described above, architectural conservation also refers to issues of identification, policy, regulation, and advocacy associated with the entirety of the cultural and built environment. This broader scope recognizes that society has mechanisms to identify and value historic cultural resources, create laws to protect these resources, and develop policies and management plans for interpretation, protection, and education. Typically this process operates as a specialized aspect of a society's planning system, and its practitioners are termed built or historic environment conservation professionals.\n\nArchitectural conservation is the process by which individuals or groups attempt to protect valued buildings from unwanted change.\n\nAs a movement, architectural conservation in general, and the preservation of ancient structures specifically, gained momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a response to Modernism and its corresponding architectural perspective, which eschewed sentimental attachment to old buildings and structures in favor of technological and architectural progress and change. Prior to this time most of the ancient buildings that were still standing had only survived because they either had significant cultural or religious import, or they had yet to be discovered.\n\nThe growth of the architectural conservation movement took place at a time of significant archaeological discovery and scientific advancement. Those educated in the field began to see various examples of architecture as either being \"correct\" or \"incorrect\". Because of this, two schools of thought began to emerge within the field of building conservation.\n\nPreservation/Conservation were used interchangeably to refer to the architectural school of thought that either encouraged measures that would protect and maintain buildings in their current state, or would prevent further damage and deterioration to them. This school of thought saw the original design of old buildings as correct in and of themselves. Two of the main proponents of preservation and conservation in the 19th century were art critic John Ruskin and artist William Morris.\n\nRestoration was the conservationist school of thought that believed historic buildings could be improved, and sometimes even completed, using current day materials, design, and techniques. In this way it's very similar to the Modernist architectural theory, except it does not advocate the destruction of ancient structures. One of the most ardent supporters of this school of thought in the 19th century was the French architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. Victorian restoration of medieval churches was widespread in England and elsewhere, with results that were deplored at the time by William Morris and are now widely regretted.\n\nThe Department of the Interior of the United States defined the following treatment approaches to architectural conservation:\n\n\nOther nations recognize some or all of these as potential treatments for historic structures. Canada recognizes preservation, rehabilitation, and restoration. The Burra Charter, for Australia, identifies preservation, restoration, and reconstruction.\n\nThe earliest building materials used by ancient peoples, such as wood and mud, were organic. Organic materials were used because they were plentiful and renewable. Unfortunately, the organic materials used were also very susceptible to the two most significant impediments to preservation and conservation: the elements and life (both human and animal). Over time inorganic materials like brick, stone, metal, concrete, and terra cotta began to be used by ancient people instead of organic ones, due to their durability. In fact, we know that these materials are durable because many ancient structures that are composed of them, even some built as far back as the Bronze Age, like Egypt's Great Pyramids, still stand today.\n\nAncient buildings such as the Egyptian pyramids, the Roman Colosseum, and the Parthenon face common preservation issues. The most prominent factors affecting these structures are the environment, pollution, and tourism.\n\nAs the Earth's climate patterns change, so too do the environmental conditions governing these buildings. For example, the Colosseum has already faced lightning, fire, and earthquakes. The changing climate increases the accumulation of salt crystals on the outside of monuments like the Colosseum and the Parthenon. This phenomenon increases the deterioration of these buildings.\n\nThe salt crystals further contribute to the black effect that man-made pollution has on these buildings. The Parthenon is especially exposed and many of the remaining marbles are eroding to the point that they may no longer be identifiable. The pollution from corrosive agents in the air has also attributed to this deterioration.\n\nThe third factor affecting ancient building conservation is tourism. While tourism provides both economical and cultural benefits, it can also be destructive. The Egyptian tomb of Seti the 1st is currently off limits to the public due to the deterioration that has been caused by tourists. The pyramids in Giza have also encountered problems due to large numbers of tourists; more tourists mean greater humidity and water presence, which can lead to erosion.\n\nAll of the above factors complicate the conservation options available to treat these buildings.\n\nThe first step in any building conservation project is a sensitive assessment of its history and merits. As noted architect Donald Insall states, \"Every building has its own biography. A knowledge of the whole life of a building brings an essential understanding of its features and its problems. He gives the Parthenon in Athens as an example; built between 447 and 432 BCE to serve as a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, its purpose over time changed to Christian church, mosque, and powder magazine before it became one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world.\n\nOnce the assessment is complete, the next step is a thorough measured survey with a tape, rod and level. Modern measuring techniques, such as photogrammetry (the use of aerial photographs to make maps and surveys) and stereophotogrammetry, are also used today to increase accuracy. Once the measurements are complete, there is an analysis of the structural stability of the building and its living pattern of movement. No building is permanently still; soil and wind can affect building stability and need to be documented. Finally, the architect or surveyor tests the electrical connections, plumbing, and other utilities present in the building (this is more for historic and re-purposed buildings). For both ancient and historic buildings, lightning conductors and fire-fighting equipment are checked to make sure they can provide sufficient protection.\n\nAt the end of this assessment process, the conservator will analyze all the collected data and decide on a conservation plan based on available funding sources..\n\nThe phrase covers a wide span of activities, from the cleaning of the interior or exterior of a building — as took place at St Paul's Cathedral in London — to the rebuilding of damaged or derelict buildings, such as the restoration of the Windsor Great Hall in Windsor Castle after a destructive fire in 1992. The 1985–1989 removal of 38 layers of paint and the cleaning and repair of the exterior sandstone walls of the White House in the United States are an example of building restoration.\n\nBuildings are structures which have, from time to time, particular purposes. They require ongoing maintenance to prevent them falling into disrepair as a result of the ravages of time and use. Building restoration can be thought of as that set of activities which are greater than year-to-year maintenance, but which by retaining the building are less than a demolition and the construction of a new building.\nNot all building conservation seeks to follow the original design of the building. It is reasonably commonplace for the shell of a building — its external walls — to be retained whilst an entirely new building is constructed within. This approach is also referred to as adaptive reuse.\n\nAlthough techniques of architectural conservation are improving, the action of cleaning or repairing buildings can, with hindsight, be seen to cause problems that at the time were unforeseen. A good example is the unrestrained use of sandblasting to clean smog deposits from soft-stoned buildings — a technique employed in the UK in the 1960s and 1970s — which has damaged the external faces of stonework to the extent that in some cases, later, the stonework has needed to be replaced. Contemporary building codes recognize such problems, and (it is to be hoped) mitigate poor outcomes.\n\nMost ancient buildings are constructed of stone and have survived from antiquity as a result of the stability of this building material. However, stone can deteriorate rapidly without protection, particularly in our modern era of pollution and climate change.\n\nThere are many organizations that work to raise public awareness of the necessity to preserve ancient and historic buildings and areas, across communities, users and government. In addition to promoting the cultural value of these buildings, and encouraging appropriate policies and strategies for conservation, the organizations can help in raising the required funding to implement conservation initiatives and plans, and often serve as a link between the community and local/federal governments to advance conservation projects. A brief list of architectural conservation organizations is below:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Kings of Navarre had private Chancellors dating back to ancient kings. Theobald II of Navarre had a Vice-Chancellor, according to letters dated 1259.\n\nIn 1512, Ferdinand the Catholic, King of Aragon and son of John II of Aragon and Navarre, invaded the Kingdom of Navarre, beginning the Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre, during the reign of Jean III d'Albret and Catherine de Foix-Béarn, and quickly conquered all of Upper Navarre and part of Lower Navarre. Jean III d'Albret tried to retake his kingdom, first in 1512, but failed despite French support, then again in 1516. Depressed by the defeats and adverse diplomatic results, he died at the castle of Esgouarrabaque in Monein, in Béarn, on 14 June 1516. His son, Henry II, attempted to reconquer the kingdom, again with French help, but this time supported by a popular revolt, however, despite some initial success, he was defeated at the Battle of Noáin on 30 June 1521 and lost all he had reconquered.\n\nHenry II moved his capital to Saint-Palais. In 1524, Charles Quint invaded Guyenne and Lower Navarre. Henry II was taken prisoner during the Battle of Pavia, in French-controlled Lombardy, on 24 February 1525, and married Marguerite d'Angoulême, the sister of François I of France the following year. A new attempt by Charles Quint to reconquer Lower Navarre in 1527 was only partially successful, after which he abandoned the idea of reconquering the country.\n\nThe deconsecrated St. Paul's Church housed the \"Chancery of Navarre\" for the century of its existence Saint-Palais, from 1524–1624. The 1522–23 meetings of the Estates of Navarre were also held in the building.\n\n\"Pierre de Biaix\" was already \"Chancellor of Navarre\" in 1512 when the kingdom was invaded and remained loyal to Henry II following the death of Jean III d'Albret.

{"id": "695530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=695530", "title": "Decade", "text": "Decade\n\nA decade is a period of 10 years. The word is derived (via French and Latin) from the ), which means \"a group of ten\". Other words for spans of years also come from Latin: biennium (2 years), triennium (3 years), quadrennium (4 years), lustrum (5 years), century (100 years), millennium (1000 years).\n\nAlthough any period of ten years is a decade, a convenient and frequently referenced interval is based on the tens digit of a calendar year, as in using \"1960s\" to represent the decade from 1960 to 1969. Often, for brevity, only the tens part is mentioned (\"60s\" or \"sixties\"), although this may leave it uncertain which century is meant. These references are frequently used to encapsulate popular culture or other widespread phenomena that dominated such a decade, as in \"The Great Depression of the 1930s\" or \"The Roaring Twenties\".\n\nHowever, the Gregorian calendar begins with the year 1. (There is no year \"zero\", and the year before AD 1 is 1 BC with nothing in between.) Therefore, its \"first\" decade is from AD 1 to AD 10, the \"second\" decade from AD 11 to AD 20, and so on. So, although \"the 1960s\" comprises the years 1960 to 1969, \"the 197th decade\" spans 1961 to 1970.\n\nA decade may also refer to an arbitrary span of ten years. For example, the statement \"during his last decade, Mozart explored chromatic harmony to a degree rare at the time\", merely refers to the last ten years of Mozart's life without regard to which calendar years are encompassed.\n\nParticularly for the 20th century, a nominal decade is often used to refer not just to a set of ten years but rather to a period roughly approximating those ten years - for example, the phrase \"the sixties\" often refers to events that took place between c. 1964 and 1972, and to memories of the counterculture, flower power, protests of 1968 and other things happening at the time. Often, such a nominal decade will come to be known by a title, such as the \"Swinging Sixties\" (1960s), the \"Warring Forties\" (1940s) and the \"Roaring Twenties\" (1920s). This practice is occasionally also used for decades of earlier centuries, for example references to the 1890s as the \"Gay Nineties\" or \"Naughty Nineties\".\n\n\n"}

He continued teaching Mathematics at St Andrews until 1915. \n\nIn projective geometry the method of Cayley–Klein metrics had been used in the 19th century to model non-euclidean geometry. In 1910 Duncan wrote \"Classification of geometries with projective metrics\". The classification is described by Daniel Corey as follows:\n\nIn 1910 Sommerville reported to the British Association on the need for a bibliography on non-euclidean geometry, noting that the field had no International Association like the Quaternion Society to sponsor it.\n\nIn 1911 Sommerville published his compiled bibliography of works on non-euclidean geometry, and it received favorable reviews. In 1970 Chelsea Publishing issued a second edition which referred to collected works then available of some of the cited authors.\n\nSommerville was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1911. His proposers were Peter Redford Scott Lang, Robert Alexander Robertson, William Peddie and George Chrystal.\n\nIn 1912 he married Louisa Agnes Beveridge.\n\nIn 1915 Sommerville went to New Zealand to take up the Chair of Pure and Applied Mathematics at the Victoria College of Wellington.\n\nDuncan became interested in honeycombs and wrote \"Division of space by congruent triangles and tetrahedra\" in 1923. The following year he extended results to \"n\"-dimensional space.\n\nHe also discovered the Dehn–Sommerville equations for the number of faces of convex polytopes.\n\nSommerville used geometry to describe the voting theory of a preferential ballot. He addressed Nanson's method where \"n\" candidates are ordered by voters into a sequence of preferences. Sommerville shows that the outcomes lie in \"n\" ! simplexes that cover the surface of an \"n\" − 2 dimensional spherical space.\n\nWhen his \"Introduction to Geometry of N Dimensions\" appeared in 1929, it received a positive review from B. C. Wong in the American Mathematical Monthly.\n\nSommerville was co-founder and first secretary of the New Zealand Astronomical Society (1920). He was President of Section A of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science meeting, Adelaide (1924). In 1926 he became a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nHe died in New Zealand on 31 January 1934.\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated, according to Anthony Wood, either at Balliol College, Oxford or at Broadgates Hall (later Pembroke College, Oxford), and left after taking a degree. After some time abroad, he appeared at Elizabeth I's court. His first patron was Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who seems to have thought of putting him forward as a rival to Sir Christopher Hatton for the queen's favour. He is mentioned by Gabriel Harvey, along with Sir Philip Sidney, as one of the ornaments of the court. Sidney, in his will, bequeathed his books equally between Fulke Greville and Dyer. He was made steward of Woodstock in 1570.\n\nHe was employed by Elizabeth on a mission (1584) to the Low Countries, and in 1589 was sent to Denmark. In a commission to inquire into manors unjustly alienated from the crown in the west country he did not altogether please the queen, but nevertheless received a grant of some forfeited lands in Somerset in 1588. He was returned the Member of Parliament for Somerset in 1589 and 1593.\n\nHe was knighted and made Chancellor of the Order of the Garter in 1596. William Oldys said of him that he \"would not stoop to fawn,\" and some of his verses seem to show that he disliked the pressures of life at court. Under James I he lost the stewardship of Woodstock around 1604.\n\nHe died in 1607 and was buried in the chancel of St Saviour's, Southwark, on 11 May 1607 (21 May N.S.). Administration of his estate was granted to his sister Margaret.\n\nWood says that many thought Dyer to be a Rosicrucian, and that he was a firm believer in alchemy, although it is doubtful that an organised Rosicrucian movement existed during Dyer's lifetime. He had a great reputation as a poet among his contemporaries, but very little of his work has survived. George Puttenham, in the \"Arte of English Poesie\" speaks of \"Maister Edward Dyar, for Elegie most sweete, solemne, and of high conceit.\" One of the poems once universally accepted as his is \"My Mynde to me a kingdome is\", which Steven W. May considers as possibly written by Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.\n\nAmong the poems in \"England's Helicon\" (1600), signed S.E.D., and included in Dr A.B. Grosart's collection of Dyer's works (\"Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies Library\", vol. iv, 1876) is the charming pastoral \"My Phillis hath the morninge sunne,\" but this comes from the \"Phillis\" of Thomas Lodge. Grosart also prints a prose tract entitled \"The Prayse of Nothing\" (1585). The \"Sixe Idillia\" from Theocritus, reckoned by John Payne Collier among Dyer's works, were dedicated to, not written by, him.\n\nIn 1943 Alden Brooks proposed Sir Edward Dyer as a candidate in the Shakespearean authorship question in his book \"Will Shakspere and the Dyer’s Hand\".\n\nFurther see: Ralph Sargant, \"At the Court of Queen Elizabeth: The Life and Lyrics of Edward Dyer\".

{"id": "617633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=617633", "title": "Guido von List", "text": "Guido von List\n\nGuido Karl Anton List, better known as Guido von List (5 October 1848 – 17 May 1919), was an Austrian occultist, journalist, playwright, and novelist. He expounded a modern Pagan new religious movement known as Wotanism, which he claimed was the revival of the religion of the ancient German race, and which included an inner set of Ariosophical teachings that he termed Armanism.\n\nBorn to a wealthy middle-class family in Vienna, List claimed that he abandoned his family's Roman Catholic faith in childhood, instead devoting himself to the pre-Christian god Wotan. Spending much time in the Austrian countryside, he engaged in rowing, hiking, and sketching the landscape. From 1877 he began a career as a journalist, primarily authoring articles on the Austrian countryside for nationalist newspapers and magazines. In these he placed a \"völkisch\" emphasis on the folk culture and customs of rural people, believing that many of them were survivals of pre-Christian, pagan religion. He published three novels, \"Carnuntum\" (1888), \"Jung Diethers Heimkehr\" (1894), and \"Pipara\" (1895), each set among the German tribes of the Iron Age, as well as authoring several plays. During the 1890s he continued writing \"völkisch\" articles, now largely for the nationalist \"Ostdeutsche Rundschau\" newspaper, with his works taking on an anti-semitic dimension halfway through that decade. In 1893, he co-founded the Literarische Donaugesellschaft literary society, and involved himself in Austria's Pan-German nationalist movement, a milieu which sought the integration of Austria into the German Empire.\n\nDuring an 11-month period of blindness in 1902, List became increasingly interested in occultism, in particular coming under the influence of the Theosophical Society, resulting in an expansion of his Wotanic beliefs to incorporate Runology and the Armanen Futharkh. The popularity of his work among the \"völkisch\" and nationalist communities resulted in the establishment of a List Society in 1908; attracting significant middle and upper-class support, the Society published List's writings and included an Ariosophist inner group, the High Armanen Order, over whom List presided as Grand Master.\nThrough these ventures he promoted the millenarian view that modern society was degenerate, but that it would be cleansed through an apocalyptic event resulting in the establishment of a new Pan-German Empire that would embrace Wotanism. Having erroneously prophesied that this empire would be established by victory for the Central Powers in World War I, List died on a visit to Berlin in 1919.\n\nDuring his lifetime, List became a well-known figure among the nationalist and \"völkisch\" subcultures of Austria and Germany, influencing the work of many others operating in this milieu. His work, propagated through the List Society, influenced later \"völkisch\" groups such as the Reichshammerbund and Germanenorden, and through those exerted an influence on both the burgeoning Nazi Party and the SS. After World War II his work continued to influence an array of Ariosophic and Heathen practitioners in Europe, Australia, and North America.\n\nGuido Karl Anton List was born on 5 October 1848 in Vienna, then part of the Austrian Empire. Born to a prosperous middle-class family, he was the eldest son of Karl Anton List, a leather goods dealer who was the son of Karl List, a publican and vintner. Guido's mother, Marian List, was the daughter of builder's merchant Franz Anton Killian. List was raised in the city's second \"bezirk\", on the eastern side of the Danube canal. Like most Austrians at the time, his family were members of the Roman Catholic denomination of Christianity, with List being christened into this faith at St Peter's Church in Vienna. Reflecting the family's wealth and bourgeoisie status, in 1851 a watercolour portrait of List was painted by the artist Anton von Anreiter.\n\nAccounts suggest that List had a happy childhood. Developing a preference for rural areas rather than urban ones, he enjoyed family visits to the countryside of Lower Austria and Moravia, and – encouraged by his father – he began to sketch and paint the castles, prehistoric monuments, and natural scenery of these areas. According to his later account, he developed an early interest in the pre-Christian religions of Austria, coming to believe that the catacombs beneath St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna had once been a shrine devoted to a pagan deity. He claimed that on an 1862 visit to the catacombs with his father, he knelt before a ruined altar and swore that when an adult he would construct a temple to the ancient god Wotan.\n\nAlthough List wanted to become an artist and scholar, he reluctantly agreed to his father's insistence that he enter the family's leather goods business. During his leisure time he devoted himself to writing and sketching as well as rambling, riding, or rowing in the countryside, becoming both a member of the Viennese rowing club Donauhort and the secretary of the Austrian Alpine Association (Österreichischer Alpenverein). He was involved in both solitary and group expeditions into the Austrian Alps, and it was on one of the latter journeys that he left his mountaineering group to spend Midsummer night alone atop the Geiselberg hillfort. On 24 June 1875 he and four friends rowed down the Danube before camping for the night at the site of the ancient Roman fortification of Carnuntum to commemorate the 1500th anniversary of the Battle of Carnuntum, in which Germanic tribes defeated the Roman Army. List later claimed that while his friends caroused, he celebrated the event with a fire and by burying eight bottles of wine in the shape of a swastika beneath the arch of the monument's Pagan Gate.\n\nIn 1877, List's father died. List soon abandoned the leather goods business that he inherited, intent on devoting himself to literary endeavours as a journalist, even if this meant a significant reduction in his income. On 26 September 1878 he married his first wife, Helene Förster-Peters. From 1877 to 1887 he wrote for the nationalist magazines \"Neue Welt\" (\"New World\"), \"Heimat\" (\"Homeland\"), \"Deutsche Zeitung\" (\"German Newspaper\"), and the \"Neue Deutsche Alpenzeitung\" (\"New German Alpine Newspaper\"), with his articles being devoted to the Austrian countryside and the folk customs of its inhabitants. His interpretations emphasised what he believed were the pagan origins of Austrian place-names, customs, and legends, describing the landscape as being embodied by \"genius loci\", and expressing clear German nationalist and \"völkisch\" sentiment.\n\nIn 1888, he published his first novel, \"Carnuntum\", in two volumes. Set in the late fourth century CE, the narrative focused on a romance set against the background of the conflict between Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire around the area of the eponymous Roman fort. The novel established List as a recognised figure within Austria's Pan-German community, a movement of individuals unified in their belief that the majority German-speaking areas of the multi-linguistic and multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian state should cede and join with the newly established German Empire. The book also brought him to the attention of Friedrich Wannieck, a wealthy industrialist who was the chairman of both the Prague Iron Company and the First Brno Engineering Company. Wannieck was also president of the Verein 'Deutsches Haus' (\"'German House' Association\"), a nationalist organisation of linguistically German inhabitants of Brno who felt encircled by the largely Czech population of South Moravia. List and Wannieck began corresponding, resulting in a lifelong friendship between the two men. The Verein 'Deutsches Haus' subsequently published three of List's works in its series on German nationalist studies of history and literature.\n\nList began regularly writing for a weekly newspaper, the \"Ostdeutsche Rundschau\" (\"East German Review\"), which had been established in 1890 by the Austrian Pan-German parliamentary deputy Karl Wolf. In 1891, List anthologised many of the magazine articles that he had written over the previous decades in his book \"Deutsch-Mythologische Landschaftsbilder\" (\"German Mythological Landscape Scenes\"), extracts of which were then published in the \"Ostdeutsche Rundschau\". Further \"völkisch\" articles on various topics pertaining to Austria's folk culture and to its ancient Germanic tribes followed during the 1890s, although midway through that decade his work took on an explicitly anti-semitic nature with articles such as \"Die Juden als Staat und Nation\". Other Austrian German nationalist newspapers which published his articles during this period included the \"Bote aus dem Waldviertel\" (\"The Waldviertel Herald\") and \"Kyffhäuser\".\n\nList began lecturing on these subjects; for instance, in February 1893 he spoke to the nationalist Verein 'Deutsches Geschichte' (\"'German History' Association) on the ancient priesthood of Wotan. He also worked as a playwright, and in December 1894 his play \"Der Wala Erweckung\" (\"The Wala's Awakening\") was premiered at an event organised by the Bund der Germanen (Germanic League) which was devoted to the German nationalist cause, with Jews being explicitly banned from attending the event. Alongside his affiliation with the Bund, List was also a member of the Deutscher Turnverein (Germanic Gymnastic League), a strongly nationalistic group to whom he contributed literary works for their events.\n\nIn 1893, List and Fanny Wschiansky founded a belletristic society devoted to encouraging German nationalist and neo-romantic literature in Vienna, the Literarische Donaugesellschaft (\"Danubian Literary Society\"). The group was partly based upon the 15th-century Litteraria Sodalita Danubiana created by the Viennese humanist Conrad Celtes, about whom List authored a brief biography in 1893. He also authored two further novels during the 1890s, both of which were historical romances set in Iron Age Germany. The first appeared in 1894 as \"Jung Diethers Heimkehr\" (\"Young Diether's Homecoming\"), which told the story of a young Teuton living in the fifth century who has been forcefully converted to Christianity but who returns to his original solar cult. The second was \"Pipara\", a two-volume story published in 1895 which told the story of an eponymous Quadi maiden who escaped captivity from the Romans to become an empress. In 1898, he then authored a catechism exhibiting a form of pagan deism titled \"Der Unbesiegbare\" (\"The Invincible\").\n\nList's activities had made him a celebrity within the Austrian Pan-German movement, with the editors of the \"Ostdeutsche Rundschau\" convening a Guido List evening in April 1895 and South Vienna's Wieden Singers' Club holding a List festival in April 1897. Having divorced his previous wife, in August 1899 List married Anna Wittek, who was from Stecky in Bohemia. Despite List's modern Pagan faith, the wedding was held in an evangelical Protestant church, reflecting the growing popularity of Protestantism among Austria's Pan-German community, who perceived it as a more authentically German form of Christianity than the Catholicism that was popular among Austria-Hungary's other ethnic and linguistic communities. Wittek had previously appeared in a performance of List's \"Der Wala Erweckung\" and had publicly recited some of his poetry. Following their marriage, List devoted himself fully to drama, authoring the plays \"König Vannius\" (\"King Vannius\") in 1899, \"Sommer-Sonnwend-Feuerzauber\" (\"Summer Solstice Fire Magic\") in 1901 and \"Das Goldstück\" (\"The Gold Coin\") in 1903. He also authored a pamphlet titled \"Der Wiederaufbau von Carnuntum\" (\"The Reconstruction of Carnuntum\") in 1900, in which he called for the reconstruction of the ancient Roman amphitheatre at Carnuntum as an open-air stage through which Wotanism could be promoted.\n\nAccording to the historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, 1902 marked \"a fundamental change in the character of [List's] ideas: occult ideas now entered his fantasy of the ancient Germanic faith.\" This began when he received an operation to remove a cataract from his eye, after which he was left blind for eleven months. During this period of rest and recuperation, he contemplated questions surrounding the origins of the German language and the use of runes. He subsequently produced a manuscript detailing what he deemed to be a proto-language of the Aryan race, in which he claimed that occult insight had enabled him to interpret the letters and sounds of both runes and emblems and glyphs found on ancient inscriptions. Terming it \"a monumental pseudo-science\", Goodrick-Clarke also noted that it constituted \"the masterpiece of his occult-nationalist researches\". List sent a copy to the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna, but they declined to publish it. In 1903 List published an article in \"Die Gnosis\" magazine, which reflected a clear influence from the ideas of the Theosophical Society.\n\nList had occasionally used the title of \"von\" in his name from 1903 onward, but began using it permanently in 1907. The term was used to denote that an individual was a member of the nobility, and when the nobility archive ordered an official enquiry into List's use of the term, he was called before magistrates in October 1907. He defended his usage of the term with the claim that he was the descendant of aristocrats from Lower Austria and Styria, and that his great-grandfather had abandoned the title to become an inn keeper. Goodrick-Clarke noted that whatever the legitimacy of List's unproven claims, claiming the title of \"von\" was \"an integral part of [List's] religious fantasy\" because in his mind it connected him to the ancient Wotanist priesthood, from whom he believed Austria's aristocrats were descended. It is possible that List decided to adopt the usage of the term after his friend, the fellow prominent Ariosophist Lanz von Liebenfels, had done so in 1903.\n\nList's popularity among the Pan-Germanist movement resulted in suggestions that a society devoted to the promotion of List's work be established. This materialised as the Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft in March 1908, which was largely funded by the Wannieck family but which also included many prominent figures from middle and upper-class Austrian and German society.\nAt Midsummer 1911, List founded the High Armanen Order (Hoher Armanen-Ordem), or HAO, as an inner group of Armanist practitioners within the List Society with whom he went on pilgrimages to various places that he believed had been ancient cultic sites associated with the worship of Wotan. He operated as leader of this group, using the title of Grand Master. The List Society also produced six booklets authored by List himself between 1908 and 1911. Titled \"Ario-Germanic research reports\", they covered List's opinions on the meaning and magical power of runes, the ancient Wotanic priesthood, Austrian folklore and place-names, and the secret messages within heraldic devices. In 1914, the Society then published List's work on runes and language that the Imperial Academy had turned down. The first three of these publications furthered List's reputation across both the \"völkisch\" and nationalist subcultures within both Austria and Germany. Many other writers were inspired by List, with a number of works being specifically dedicated to him. The editor of \"Prana\", Johannes Balzli, authored a biography of List that was published in 1917.\n\nDuring World War I, List erroneously proclaimed that there would be victory for the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary, claiming to have learned this information from a vision that he experienced in 1917.\nBy 1918, List was in declining health, furthered by the food shortages experienced in Vienna as a result of the war.\nIn the spring of 1919, at the age of 71, List and his wife set off to recuperate and meet followers at the manor house of Eberhard von Brockhusen, a List Society patron who lived at in Brandenburg, Germany.\nOn arrival at the Anhalter Station at Berlin, List felt too exhausted to continue the journey. After a doctor had diagnosed a lung inflammation his health deteriorated quickly, and he died in a Berlin guesthouse on the morning of 17 May 1919. He was cremated in Leipzig and his ashes laid in an urn and then buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery, Zentralfriedhof. An obituary of List authored by Berlin journalist Philipp Stauff then appeared in the \"Münchener Beobachter\".\n\nList promoted a religion termed \"Wotanism\", which he saw as the exoteric, outer form of pre-Christian Germanic religion, while \"Armanism\" was the term he applied to what he believed were the esoteric, secret teachings of this ancient belief system. He believed that while Wotanism expounded polytheism for the wider population, those who were members of the Armanist elite were aware of the reality of monotheism. List's Armanism would later be classified as a form of \"Ariosophy\", a term which was coined by Lanz von Liebenfels in 1915. Goodrick-Clarke considered List's ideas to be a \"unique amalgam of nationalist mythology and esotericism\". Religious studies scholar Olav Hammer noted that List's Wotanism \"increasingly came to consist of an original synthesis of his reading of Germanic mythology with Theosophy\". List's early Theosophical influence came largely from the writings of German Theosophist Max Ferdinand Sebaldt von Werth, who had combined Theosophical ideas with his own interpretations of Germanic mythology and emphasis on racial doctrines, thus anticipating Ariosophy. In later work, this Theosophical influence over List's thinking grew, and he began referencing works such as Helena Blavatsky's \"Die Geheimlehre\" and William Scott Elliot's \"The Lost Lemuria\" in his publications. He expressed the view that Norse mythology accorded with – and thus proved – the cosmogonical teachings of Theosophy.\n\nMuch of List's understanding of the ancient past was based not on empirical research into historical, archaeological, and folkloric sources, but rather on ideas that he claimed to have received as a result of clairvoyant illumination. Later writer Richard Rudgley thus characterised List's understanding of the \"pagan past\" as an \"imaginative reconstruction\".\nList's Wotanism was constructed largely on the \"Prose Edda\" and the \"Poetic Edda\", two Old Norse textual sources which had been composed in Iceland during the late Middle Ages; he nevertheless believed that they accurately reflected the belief systems of Germany, having been authored by \"Wotanist\" refugees fleeing Christianity. He believed that prior to the spread of Christianity into Northern Europe, there had once been a culturally unified German civilisation that had been spread across much of Europe, which came to be degraded and divided under the impact of Christianity. He believed that the Danubian region of modern Austria had thus been part of this unified German civilisation before the growth of the Roman Empire, an idea in contrast to the view accepted by historians of the time that linguistically German communities only settled in the area during the reign of the Frankish king Charlemagne in the ninth century CE, pushing out the pre-existing linguistically Celtic groups.\n\nList believed that the basic teachings of Wotanism were found in the runic alphabet, believing that they could be deciphered by linking these letters with particular runic spells which appear in the Old Norse \"Havamal\". He claimed to have deciphered these secret meanings himself, translating them as statements such as \"Know yourself, then you know everything\", \"Do not fear death, he cannot kill you\", \"Marriage is the root of the Aryan race!\", and \"Man is one with God!\" List emphasised the importance of a mystical union between humans and the universe, viewing divinity as being immanent in nature, with all life being an emanation of it. Connected to this, he believed in a close identification between the racial group – the \"volk\" or folk – and the natural world. List believed that human beings had an immortal soul, and that it would be reincarnated according to the laws of karma until eventually uniting with divinity.\n\nIn the 1890s, List initially devised the idea that ancient German society had been led by a hierarchical system of initiates, the \"Armanenschaft\", an idea which had developed into a key part of his thinking by 1908. List's image of the Armanenschaft's structure was based largely on his knowledge of Freemasonry. He claimed that the ancient brotherhood had consisted of three degrees, each with their own secret signs, grips, and passwords. He believed that the Armanenschaft had societal control over the ancient German people, acting as teachers, priests, and judges. In List's interpretation of history, the Christian missionaries persecuted the Armanenschaft, resulting in many fleeing northward into Scandinavia and Iceland. He believed that they developed a secretive language for transmitting their teachings, known as \"kala\".\n\nList claimed that after the Christianisation of Northern Europe, the Armanist teachings were passed down in secret, thus resulting in their transmission through later esoteric traditions such as Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism. He also claimed that the Medieval Knights Templar had been keepers of these Armanist secrets, and that they had been persecuted by the Christian establishment as a result of this; he believed that the deity they were accused of worshiping, Baphomet, was actually a sigil of the Maltese Cross representing Armanist teachings. According to List, a number of prominent Renaissance humanists – including Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Giordano Bruno, Johannes Trithemius, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, and Johann Reuchlin – were also aware of this ancient Armanist teaching, with List claiming that he was actually the reincarnation of Reuchlin. In addition, List claimed that in the eighth century, Armanists had imparted their secret teachings to the Jewish rabbis of Cologne in the hope of preserving them from Christian persecution; he believed that these teachings became the Kabbalah, which he therefore reasoned was an ancient German and not Jewish innovation, thus legitimising its usage in his own teachings. Rudgley stated that this \"tortuous argument\" was used to support List's anti-semitic agenda.\n\nList generally saw the world in which he was living as one of degeneration, comparing it with the societies of the Late Roman and Byzantine Empires. He bemoaned the decline of the rural peasantry through urbanisation, having witnessed how Vienna's population tripled between 1870 and 1890, resulting in overcrowding, a growth in diseases like tuberculosis, and a severe strain on the city's resources. A staunch monarchist, he opposed all forms of democracy, feminism, and modern trends in the arts, such as those of the Vienna Secessionists. Influenced by the Pan-Germanist politician Georg Ritter von Schönerer and his Away from Rome! movement, List decried the growing influence of linguistically Slavic communities within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was opposed to \"laissez-faire\" capitalism and large-scale enterprise, instead favouring an economic system based on small-scale artisans and craftsmen, being particularly unhappy with the decline in tradesmen's guilds. He was similarly opposed to the modern banking sector and financial institutions, deeming it to be dominated by Jews; in criticising these institutions, he expressed anti-semitic sentiments. Such views of the country's economic situation were not uncommon in Austria at the time, having become particularly widespread following the Panic of 1873. The later Heathen and runologist Edred Thorsson noted that List's \"theories were to some degree based on the anti-semitic dogmas of the day\", while Hammer stated that the Ariosophic tradition promulgated by List and others was \"unambiguously racist and anti-semitic\".\n\nList believed that the degradation of modern Western society was as a result of a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he believed that the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.\n\nWriting in 2003, the historian of religion Mattias Gardell believed that List had become the \"revered guru of Ariosophic paganism\". Gardell considered the Austrian esotericist to have been \"a legend in his lifetime\", with List's ideas being embraced by many \"völkisch\" groups in Germany. German members of the List Society included Philipp Stauff, Karl Hellwig, Georg Hauerstein, Bernhard Koerner, and Eberhard von Brockhusen, who were founding members of the Reichshammerbund and Germanenorden; through the Germanenorden's Munich offshoot, the Thule Society, a lineage can be drawn between the List Society and the early Nazi Party as it was established after World War I. \nGoodrick-Clarke opined that \"this channel of influence certainly carries most weight in any assessment of List's historical importance.\" The scholar of Western esotericism Joscelyn Godwin expressed the view that List was one of the \"three godfathers of Nazi Thule\" alongside Liebenfels and Rudolf von Sebottendorff, while Rudgley went further by claiming that List's vision of a future German Empire constituted \"a blueprint for the Nazi regime\".\n\nOther German \"völkisch\" figures promoted Listian ideas to the wider public during and after the First World War. Further individuals – notably Rudolf John Gorsleben, Werner von Bülow, Friedrich Bernhard Marby, Herbert Reichstein, and Frodi Ingolfson Werhmann – took List's Ariosophical ideas alongside those of Liebenfels and built upon them further, resulting in a flourishing Ariosophical movement in the late 1920s and 1930s, with some of these individuals being within the coterie of prominent Nazi Heinrich Himmler and influencing the symbolism and rituals of the SS. His was also exerted an influence on the Australian Odinist and Ariosophist Alexander Rud Mills.\n\nBoth Goodrick-Clarke and later the religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein described List as \"the pioneer of \"völkisch\" rune occultism\", with the latter adding that \"the roots of modern esoteric runology are found in Guido List's visions.\" In 1984, Thorsson expressed the view that List's impact was such that he was \"able to shape the runic theories of German magicians (although not necessarily their \"political\" ones) from that time to the present day.\" In 1976, two longstanding activists in the \"völkisch\" and far-right milieu, Adolf and Sigrun Schleipfer, established the Armanen-Order in order to revive List's ideas, adopting a strong anti-modernist stance and a desire to revive pre-Christian religion. It was through the Armanen-Order that Thorsson, who joined it, learned about List's work. Thorsson then spearheaded \"the post-war runic revival\", founding an initiatory organisation known as the Rune Gild in 1980. Thorsson was responsible for translating a number of List's works into English, alongside those of other \"völkisch\" mystics like Siegfried Adolf Kummer. These publications brought awareness of List to an English-speaking readership, with his 1988 translation of List's \"The Secret of the Runes\" initiating a surge of interest in Ariosophy among the Heathen community of the United States. List's runology also made an appearance in Stephan Grundy's 1990 book \"Teutonic Magic\".\nList's Armanist ideas have been cited as an inspiration for the American Odinist militant David Lane, with Wotansvolk, a group that List was involved in establishing, viewing their own activism as a continuation of that begun by List. List was also of interest to the Heathen Michael Moynihan, who spent time visiting the places in Austria that are associated with List's life.\n\nA bibliography of List's published books is provided in Goodrick-Clarke's study \"The Occult Roots of Nazism\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1597364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1597364", "title": "History of juggling", "text": "History of juggling\n\nThe art of juggling has existed in various cultures throughout history. The beginning is uncertain. The first depictions were found in ancient Egypt, China, Greece, and Rome, as well as medieval and modern societies.\n\nThe earliest record of toss juggling is a painting on the wall of Tomb 15 in Egypt's Beni Hasan cemetery complex. This tomb belonged to Baqet III, a provincial governor of Menat-Khufu (present day Minya) during the later years of the Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt. It depicts female dancers and acrobats juggling up to three balls, and one of the girls is juggling with her arms crossed.\n\nIn another Beni Hasan painting, four girls are playing a juggling game in which two girls throw and catch a ball while being carried on the backs of the others. Arthur Watson, in his 1907 article for \"The Reliquary and Illustrated Archaeologist\", suggests that if a player dropped the ball in this game, it became that player’s turn to become the bearer.\n\nBrooklyn Museum associate curator Dr. Robert Bianchi suggests that the appearance of jugglers in the Beni Hassan tomb may be \"an analogy between balls and circular mirrors, as round things were used to represent solar objects, birth and death.\" \n\nReferences to jugglers in Chinese literature from the Spring and Autumn period indicate that toss juggling was a well-developed form of ancient Chinese art.\n\nXiong Yiliao (), was a Chu warrior who fought under King Zhuang of Chu (ruled 613-591 BC) during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. Ancient Chinese annals state that he practiced nòngwán, \"throwing multiple objects up and down without dropping\". During a battle in about 603 BC between the states of Chu and Song, Xiong Yiliao stepped out between the armies and juggled nine balls, which so amazed the Song troops that all five hundred of them turned and fled, allowing the Chu army to win a complete victory. As Xu Wugui recounts in Chapter 24 of the Zhuangzi, “Yiliao of Shinan juggled balls, and the conflict between the two states was ended.”\n\nLanzi (), another juggler from the Spring and Autumn period who is mentioned in the Chinese annals, lived during the reign of Duke Yuan of Song (531-517 BC). Roughly translated, Chapter 8 of the Liezi, an ancient collection of Daoist sayings, reads as follows:\n\nThe passage states that Lanzi juggled the jian, a straight, double-edged sword which was used during the Spring and Autumn period. According to Jian Zhao in \"The Early Warrior and the Birth of the Xia\", Lanzi was a general term for itinerant entertainers in pre-Qin and Han times.\n\nGuhl and Koner, in \"The Life of the Greeks and Romans\", describe the jugglers of ancient Greece:\n\nJuggling, acrobatics, and other games of skill appear frequently in Greek and Etruscan tomb reliefs, coins, and vases. A terracotta statuette from Hellenistic Thebes shows a man balancing balls on his knee and head. Another example, a vase from Nola in the British Museum dating to 430 BC, shows a seated woman juggling two balls.\n\nIn his \"Symposium\", set in 421 BC, the Greek historian Xenophon describes the appearance of a dancing girl at a dinner presided over by Socrates. Xenophon writes:\n\nMany archaeological depictions of juggling in ancient Rome have been discovered. A monument with an inscription to Septumia Spica in the collection of the Museum of Roman Civilization depicts two relief carvings of a man toss juggling five balls while manipulating two more with his feet. A similar relief carving in Maffei’s Museum Veronense of a consul giving the signal for the circus games to begin includes a detail showing a boy toss juggling five balls.\n\nIn addition to images depicting juggling, several Roman writers mention jugglers. For example, Marcus Manilius described jugglers in an astrological calendar, writing that a juggler's \"quick hands supplied a constant stream of balls to his feet with which he played and ball after ball poured over the limbs of his body.”\n\nA second century AD epitaph honors a juggler named Ursus. (Note: Although many juggling history sources refer to this man as Ursus Togatus, the word \"togatus\" in this case merely indicates that Ursus was a Roman citizen who could wear a toga.) As opposed to the “pilarii” (toss jugglers), Ursus was a “pilecrepus,” apparently performing body bounces and catches with a single ball. His inscription reads:\n\nArchaeologist Murray McClellan describes a millefiori glass ball on display at the Penn Museum which was probably used in a juggling game called trigon, and it may have been the same game described in the Ursus inscription. Although the rules of trigon are not fully understood, it appears to have involved three players posted at the corners of a triangle throwing multiple balls back and forth as fast as possible, catching them with one hand and tossing them back with the other.\n\nQuintilian, in his \"Institutes of Oratory\", draws a parallel between the skill of an orator who scans ahead in his reading to that of a juggler, writing: \n\nSidonius Apollinaris, a Roman officer leading a legion in the French province of Niemen, wrote in his letters that he enjoyed juggling three or four balls as a hobby for his own satisfaction and to entertain his companions in the legions.\n\nThe Roman poet Martial describes a juggler named Agathinus who performed a unique shield manipulation routine:\n\nThe Tractate Sukkah of the Talmud says that Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel (10 BC to 70 AD) could “take eight fire torches and throw them in the air and catch one and throw one and they did not touch one another.” Another mention of torch juggling from around the third century AD appears in the letters of Alciphron, where an incident is described involving a woman whose husband “was attached to the Ionian lass who tosses balls and juggles torches.” \n\nAn ancient mention of knife juggling comes from the early Church father Chrysostom, who in Antioch around AD 450 witnessed jugglers “tossing up knives in rapid succession into the air and catching them by the handle.” \n\nIn the Middle Ages juggling was one of many skills performed by entertainers and buffoons. Representations of juggling in the Middle Ages may be found in illuminated manuscripts in the British Museum. One manuscript (Cotton MS. Tib. C. vi, folio 30 v.), from an eleventh century book on the life of Christ, shows an attendant of King David juggling three balls with his right hand and three knives with his left. William the Conqueror’s minstrel Taillefer is recorded as performing a simple juggling trick with his sword at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, throwing and catching it, and then killing an English soldier.\n\nThe Boke of Saint Albans, published in England in 1486, mentions a “Neverthriving of Jugglers” as part of a list of collective nouns. \n\nLegends and epic sagas from medieval folklore mention juggling. The Irish hero Cuchulainn is described “keeping nine apples, and his shield, and his sword in the air, that none of them fell to the ground.” Similarly, in The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel, a juggler named Tulchinne is described with “nine swords in his hand, and nine silvern shields, and nine apples of gold.”\n\nIn 1528, Emperor Babur of Hindustan described in his memoir a group of jugglers simultaneously spinning seven rings on their forehead, thighs, fingers, and toes. In the same year, Aztec antipodist jugglers were brought to Europe by Hernán Cortés and painted by Christoph Weiditz.\n\nStewart Culin in \"Games of the North American Indians\" lists examples of juggling among the Naskapi, Eskimo, Achomawi, Bannock, Shoshone, Ute, and Zuni tribes of North America. One example, quoted from George Dorsey, describes a game played by Shoshone women who juggled up to four balls made of mud, cut gypsum, or rounded water-worn stones. Dorsey describes betting contests in which the women raced toward an objective such as a tree or tipi while juggling. This may be an early example of joggling.\n\nOtedama is a traditional Japanese juggling game practiced by women throwing up to five balls in a shower pattern, often while singing rhymes. A similar game called \"hiko,\" involving throwing limes, gourds, or tuitui nuts in the shower pattern has been played by young girls in Tonga for centuries. The earliest record of juggling in Tonga is from Johann Reinhold Forster in 1773, who describes a girl of 10–12 years juggling five fruits on the beach. Incredibly, Polynesian women have been verified showering 7 tuitui nuts, and there are reliable reports of women showering up to 10 nuts.\n\n1680 – Germany<br>\nTown Council of Nuremberg hires a \"ball-master\" who juggled and taught others juggling and other skills.\n\n1768 – England<br>\nPhilip Astley opens the first modern circus. A few years later he employs jugglers to perform acts along with the horse and clown acts. From then until the modern day, jugglers have found work and have commonly been associated with circuses.\n\n1793 – North America<br>\nJohn Bill Ricketts presents America's first circus. In the opening show, watched by George Washington, Ricketts juggled on horseback.\n\n1821 – England<br>\nWilliam Hazlitt writes the essay \"The Indian Juggler\" describing a four ball juggling routine in detail, probably performed by Ramo Samee, considered to be the first modern professional juggler. In his day Ramo Samee was a well-known British celebrity.\n\nMid-Late19th century – Europe and North America <br>\nVariety and music hall theatres become more popular, and jugglers are in demand to fill time between music acts, performing in front of the curtain while sets are changed. \n\n1883 – North America<br>\nIn Boston a new style of variety show is born. The format is a continuous show, the same 8-10 acts repeated over and over, the audience coming and going when they had seen all the acts. This was later known as Vaudeville.\n\n1885 – England <br>\nPaul Cinquevalli (1859 – 1918) made his debut at a circus in Covent Garden, London. Cinquevalli was the first juggling super-star, and was referred to by the British press as the world’s greatest juggler.\n\nLate 19th century – Early 20th century – North America<br>\nIn the USA the popularity of variety shows and vaudeville shows created great demand for professional jugglers. To distinguish them from other entertainers, jugglers were constantly developing new tricks, props, styles and characters, many of which survive to this day.\n\nHere are some juggling \"firsts\" from America, based on anecdotal evidence.\n\n1896 – Siberia<br>\nEnrico Rastelli is born. Rastelli (1896–1931) is considered to be one of the greatest jugglers who ever lived. He is recorded as juggling 10 balls (though never 9), 8 sticks (small clubs) and 8 plates. He was also one of the first jugglers to use footballs (soccer balls) and other large rubber balls.\n\n1912 – North America<br>\nGlow-props are invented. Adolf Behrend, the German Gentleman juggler \"Salerno\" builds a set of clubs with electric lights inside which changed colors as he juggles them.\n\n1930-1950 – Europe and North America<br>\nVariety and Vaudeville shows start to decline in popularity due to competition from motion picture theatres, radio and television.\n\n1947 – North America<br>\nThe International Jugglers' Association is formed.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47355353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47355353", "title": "Hokushin-ron", "text": "Hokushin-ron\n\nThe was a pre-World War II political doctrine of the Empire of Japan which stated that Manchuria and Siberia were Japan's sphere of interest and that the potential value to Japan for economic and territorial expansion in those areas was greater than elsewhere. Its supporters were sometimes called the \"Strike North Group\". It enjoyed wide support within the Imperial Japanese Army during the interwar period, but was abandoned in 1939 after military defeat on the Mongolian front at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol (known in Japan as the Nomonhan incident). It was superseded by the diametrically-opposite rival policy, the , which regarded Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands as Japan's political and economic sphere of influence and aimed to acquire the resources of European colonies while neutralising the threat of Western military forces in the Pacific.\n\nFrom the First Sino-Japanese War in the 1890s, \"Hokushin-ron\" came to dominate Japanese foreign policy. It guided both the Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895) and the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910 which annexed Korea to Japan. After the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5) Field Marshal Prince Yamagata Aritomo, a political and military ideological architect of \"Hokushin-ron\", traced the lines of a defensive strategy against Russia. A February 1907 Imperial National Defence guideline envisioned two strategies: \"Nanshu Hokushin Ron\" (南守北進, defence in the South and advance in the North) and \"Hokushu Nanshin Ron\" (北守南進, defence in the North and advance in the South). There was intense discourse within Japan on the two diverging theories. Following World War I, Japanese troops were deployed as part of the Siberian Intervention during the Russian Civil War, with the hope that Japan could be freed from any future Russian threat by detaching Siberia and forming an independent buffer state. The Japanese troops remained until 1922, encouraging discussion by Japanese strategic planners of the idea of permanent Japanese occupation of Siberia east of Lake Baikal.\n\nAn essential step in the \"Hokushin-ron\" proposal was for Japan to seize control of Manchuria, so as to obtain an extensive \"de facto\" land border with the Soviet Union. Insubordination by rogue Japanese military personnel in the Kwantung Army in 1931 led to the Mukden Incident and provided a pretext for the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. As the Kwantung Army had 12,000 men available for the invasion of Manchuria at the time it needed reinforcements. War minister Sadao Araki was a solid supporter of the \"Hokushin-ron,\" and of a proposed attack on the Soviet Far East and Siberia. He arranged for Chōsen Army forces to be moved from Korea north into Manchuria without permission from Tokyo in support of the Kwantung Army. The plot to seize Manchuria proceeded as planned, and when presented by the \"fait accompli\", all Prime Minister Reijirō Wakatsuki could do was weakly protest and resign with his cabinet. When the new cabinet was formed, Araki, as War Minister, was the real power in Japan. A puppet state was formed in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia. It was named Manchukuo and governed under a form of constitutional monarchy.\n\nHokushin-ron was largely supported by the Imperial Japanese Army. General Kenkichi Ueda was a strong believer in the \"Hokushin-ron\" policy, believing that Japan's main enemy was communism and that Japan's destiny lay in conquest of the natural resources of the sparely populated north Asian mainland. General Yukio Kasahara was also a major proponent of the \"Hokushin-ron\" philosophy, feeling strongly that the Soviet Union posed both a major threat and a major opportunity for Japan.\n\nHowever, rival cliques of officers in the Army claimed to represent the \"true will\" of the Emperor. The radical ultranationalist \"Imperial Way Faction\" (\"Kōdōha\") had many young activists who were strongly supportive of the \"Hokushin-ron\" strategy and a preemptive strike against the Soviet Union. They were opposed by the more moderate conservative \"Control Faction\" (\"Tōseiha\"), which favored a more cautious defence expansion and sought to impose greater discipline over the Army and war with China as a strategic imperative.\n\nRelations between the Japanese Army and Navy were never cordial, and often marked by deep hostility, a situation whose origin can be traced back to the Meiji period. From the early 1930s the Army saw the Soviet Union as Japan's greatest threat and for the most part supported the \"Hokushin-ron\" concept that Japan's strategic interests were on the Asian continent. The Navy looked across the Pacific Ocean and saw the United States as the greatest threat, and for the most part supported the \"Nanshin-ron\" concept that Japan's strategic interests were in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. By the mid-1930s there was the serious possibility of a clash between the Army and Navy due to incompatible expansionist ideas.\n\nThe Kōdōha faction, which favoured \"Hokushin-ron\", was dominant in the Army during Araki's tenure as Minister of War from 1931 to 1934, occupying most significant staff positions. However, many of its members were replaced by Tōseiha officers following Araki's resignation from ill health in 1934. In 1936, Kōdōha-affiliated young Army officers launched an unsuccessful coup d'état in the February 26 Incident. As a result, Kōdōha generals were purged from the Army, including Araki, who was forced to retire in March 1936.\n\nThe Imperial Defence Plan, formulated in June 1936, incorporated a balance of both \"Hokushin-ron\" and \"Nanshin-ron\", requiring that both the Army and the Navy take a peaceful and unprovocative approach to their \"enemies\". The plan's goal was to acquire territories which possessed the raw materials, particularly petroleum, which Japan needed to sustain its growth and economy, but which it did not possess itself. Northward expansion (\"Hokushin-ron\") would gain the natural resources of Siberia by attacking the Soviet Union via Manchuria. Southward expansion (\"Nanshin-ron\") would involve seizing the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and other colonies from the French and/or British. Japan's supply of resources would eventually be assured by creating a \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\". However, European powers had been dominant in Southeast Asia for more than a century, and Japanese foreign policy had little experience there. In pursuing \"Nanshin-ron\" Japan would risk – and in some quarters even welcome – a large-scale war with the great powers from across the globe.\n\nIn November 1936 the Anti-Comintern Pact was concluded between Japan and Nazi Germany. It agreed that in case of an attack by the Soviet Union against Germany or Japan, the two countries agreed to consult on what measures to take \"to safeguard their common interests\". They also agreed that neither of them would make any political treaties with the Soviet Union, and Germany also agreed to recognize Manchukuo.\n\nA series of Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, without any formal declaration of war, began in 1932. Aggressive actions initiated by Japanese staff and field officers on the Soviet border with Manchukuo and Mongolia led to the disastrous Battles of Khalkhin Gol (1939) which resulted in heavy casualties for Kwantung Army and severely challenged its much-vaunted reputation. Any farther expansion northwards into Siberia was shown to be impossible given the Soviet superiority in numbers and armour. However, General Ueda continued to support the actions of his officers and refused to discourage them from taking similar actions, remaining adamant in his support of the \"Hokushin-ron\" policy. He was recalled back to Japan in late 1939 and forced into retirement. The Kwantung Army was purged of both its more insubordinate elements and its proponents of \"Hokushin-ron\".\n\nThe Army lost prestige due to its failures in the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts; as a result the Navy gained the ascendency. It was supported in this by a number of the powerful industrial Zaibatsus, convinced that they could best serve their interests by fulfilling the needs of the Navy. The military setbacks on the Mongolian front, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War, and negative Western attitudes towards Japanese expansionist tendencies led to a shift towards \"Nanshin-ron\" in order to procure colonial resources in South East Asia and to neutralize the threat posed by Western military forces in the Pacific. Japan and the USSR signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941, freeing Japan for preparations for the Pacific War. When Nazi Germany launched its invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Japan did not join its Axis ally's invasion by opening a second front in the Far East. Indeed, Japan did not militarily engage with the Soviet Union again until the USSR declared war on Japan in August 1945.\n"}

Over 160,000 Jews from the region perished.

Since the brick-drying sheds were rather limited, many of the ghetto inhabitants were compelled to live under the open sky. The ghetto was guarded by a special unit of gendarmes from Budapest and operated under the command of Krasznai, one of the most cruel ghetto commanders in Hungary.\n\nAs a result of torture, malnutrition, and a totally inadequate water supply in the ghetto, the Jews of Sălaj County arrived at Auschwitz in such poor condition, so that an unusually large percentage were selected for gassing immediately upon arrival. The deportations from Cehei were carried out in three transports between May 31 and June 8.\n\nAlthough built structures no longer exist on the site of the former brickyard, the Jewish Architectural Heritage Foundation has set up signposts commemorating the events that took place at what is now known as the Cehei Ghetto. Organized tours frequently visit the site, as scheduled by the Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum JAHF is currently negotiating the procurement of an Authentic Cattle Car that was used to transport Jews to the Death Camps, for a permanent exhibit at the site of the former ghetto.\n\nThe Jewish Architectural Heritage Foundation is planning on the construction of a Holocaust Memorial designed by Architect Adam Aaron Wapniak on the site of the old Nuşfalău Synagogue, directly adjacent to an existing War memorial. The barren site aptly reflects the absence of the towns once vibrant Jewish population. Serving as a silent memorial to the Holocaust, the message is emboldened through sculptural suggestion and duplicitous abstractions. Embracing dichotomous design; the steel tracks represent the grotesqueness of the holocaust, as well as the temporal journey of the Jewish people. Resembling a flower; the breach in the tracks is emblematic of incidents of persecution and repression - all the while rising forth, blooming like a lotus.\n\nJAHF has funded the Restoration of the Jewish Cemetery in Jibou, Romania - and has contributed to the care of other outlying cemeteries in the region. Typical tasks include straightening or righting fallen tombstones, inscription reparation and landscaping of these holy sites.\n\nThe Jewish Architectural Heritage Foundation has also completed a number of video documentaries, noting the personal accounts of individuals from around the Șimleu Silvaniei area. The most notable documentary (currently in editing) features Elly Gross as she walks through the town of Simleu Silvaniei, giving an account of the Jews who once walked in its streets.\n\nAsociata Memoralia Hebraica Nuşfalău\n"}

She was one of the leading economic and social historians of the 20th century, greatly influencing the methodology and direction of research. Her most prominent contribution was to pioneer the use of local manuscripts as a source.\n\nDuring the Second World War Joan Watkins worked as an intelligence analyst at Bletchley Park, providing information that assisted Hut 6 in the breaking of the Enigma ciphers and added substantially to the substance of the subsequent intelligence reports. She worked in the Sixta traffic analysis group alongside her future husband Jimmy (30 May 1914 - 2 June 2018). \nJimmy and Joan married in September 1945 and moved to London, where Jimmy returned to his job as a librarian, initially in Hornsey, north London, and Joan resumed her studies. When Jimmy retired in 1974, they moved first to Oxford, and then, on her retirement, to Hadlow in Kent.\n\nHer academic career began with assistant lectureship in sociology at the London School of Economics. She was later senior research fellow at the University of Leicester from 1951 to 65, and reader in economic history at Oxford University between 1975 and 1983. She was the editor of \"The Agrarian History of England and Wales\" (for volumes 4–6) from 1964 to 1972 and in 1974 was appointed general editor of the series.\n\nShe sat on the editorial board of \"Past & Present\" from 1957 to 1992. She was appointed a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1974 and made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1993.\n\nAlthough best known for her agrarian history, Joan Thirsk also had a strong interest in food history, especially in her later years. In 1995 she gave a paper on preserving food to the Leeds Symposium on the History of Food which was subsequently published. She advised on the curation of an exhibition: \"Fooles and Fricasees: Food in Shakespeare’s England\" at the Folger Shakespeare Library in 1999, contributing an essay: Food in Shakespeare’s England to the catalogue. Her thought- provoking book Alternative Agriculture (1997) considered the demand for food in England but her fully-fledged ideas on food history formed the subject of her last major work \"Food in Early Modern England Phases, Fads, Fashions 1500-1760\". In this book Thirsk surveys the history of English food chronologically, taking information from scientific writers, cookery books, household accounts, and the food of the poor, followed by thematic sections looking closer at regional diets and individual foods. Throughout she tries to consider the diet of all social classes and is intent on dispelling the myth that the food of the bulk of the population at this time was dull and monotonous. Indeed, she argues the opposite- the range of plants and animals eaten at this time was much greater than commonly available today. The poor were diligent in gathering wild herbs and plants and at all levels of society food was discussed and appreciated.\nHer interest in food history was long evident at a personal level. She baked her own bread and a colleague recalls going to dinner with her in the 1970s and being served barley rolls with the soup- she wanted to see how palatable was pure barley bread (the stable food of many in sixteenth-century Southern England). All at dinner agreed that it was hard and difficult to eat!\n\n\n\n\n"}

He authored the 1523 \"Annals of Bavaria\", a valuable record of the early history of Germany.\n\nHaving studied at Ingolstadt, Vienna, Cracow and Paris, he returned to Ingolstadt in 1507 and in 1509 was appointed tutor to Louis and Ernest, the two younger brothers of William IV, Duke of Bavaria, all three the sons of Albert the Wise, the late duke of Bavaria. Aventinus retained this position until 1517, wrote a Latin grammar (\"Rudimenta grammaticae latinae\"; 1512) and other manuals for the use of his pupils, and in 1515 travelled in Italy with Ernest. In his zeal for learning, he helped found the Sodalitas litteraria Angilostadensis, the \"literary brotherhood of Ingolstadt\", under the auspices of which several old manuscripts were brought to light; however, it soon ceased to exist (1520).\n\nIn 1517, William appointed him as Bavaria's official historian and commissioned him to write a history of the country. Many of the important authorities which Aventinus collected for this purpose have been preserved only in his copies. He embodied a critical treatment of them in a complete history of Bavaria, \"Annales Bojorum\" (\"Annals of Bavaria\"). His condensed German version of it, the \"Bayerische Chronik\", is the first important history in the German language.\n\nAventinus remained a Catholic throughout his life, even though he sympathized with aspects of the Protestant reform. He was in communication with Philipp Melanchthon and Martin Luther. He rejected auricular confession, objected to pilgrimages and indulgences, and opposed the claims of the hierarchy as excessive. He showed a strong dislike for monks. On this account, he was imprisoned in 1528, but his friends soon effected his release. The remainder of his life was somewhat unsettled, and he died at Regensburg.\n\nThe \"Annals\", which are in seven volumes, deal with the history of Bavaria in conjunction with general history from the earliest times to 1460, and the author shows sympathy for the Empire in its struggle with the Papacy. He took pains with his work, and to some degree anticipated the modern historiography. Another result of his nonconformity was that the \"Annals\" were not published until 1554. Many passages were omitted in this Ingolstadt edition, as they reflected on the Roman Catholics.\n\nA more complete edition was published at Basel in 1580 by Nicholas Cisner. Aventinus, who has been called the \"Bavarian Herodotus,\" wrote other books of lesser importance, and a complete edition of his works was published at Munich (1881–1886).\n\nIn his \"Chronik\", Aventinus fabricated a succession of Teutonic kings stretching back to the Great Flood, ruling over vast swathes of Germany and surrounding regions until the 1st century BC, and involving themselves in numerous events from Biblical and Classical history.\n\nThese rulers and their exploits are mostly fictitious, though some are derived from mythological, legendary or historical figures. Examples of the latter are Boiger, Kels II and Teutenbuecher, whose joint reign is given as 127–100 BC, and who are based on King Boiorix of the Cimbri, the unnamed king of the Ambrones, and King Teutobod of the Teutons.\n\nLudwig I of Bavaria had Aventinus' bust erected in the Walhalla temple.\nThere is a German wheat beer named after him, made by G. Schneider & Son.\n\n\n"}

He taught at the Higher Institute of Philosophy of the University of Leuven and was the founder of the school of thought called transcendental Thomism, which attempted to merge the theological and philosophical thought of St. Thomas Aquinas with that of Immanuel Kant.\n\nMaréchal joined the Jesuits in 1895 and after a doctorate in biology at Leuven (1905) he first specialized in experimental psychology, spending some time in Munich with Wilhelm Wundt (1911). Until the end of his life Maréchal would say that his real interest was more in psychology than in philosophy.\n\nPrompted by the call of Pope Leo XIII to revitalize Thomist theology, he started studying in depth the works of St. Thomas Aquinas in order to understand the inner coherence of his system, along with the works of other scholastic thinkers, modern philosophers and scientists of the day. From this, and in particular from Kant’s transcendental idealism, emerged a new and more dynamic Thomism, recapturing the union of ‘act and power’ in Aquinas. The development of his thought can be grasped in the five \"cahiers\" (see bibliography) in which, after exposing the weaknesses of traditional Thomism, he evaluated Kant’s philosophy (3d cahier) with whose help he proposes a modernized Thomism in the 4th and 5th cahier. The work of Maréchal had a great influence on such contemporary theologians and philosophers as Andre Marc, Gaston Isaye, , Karl Rahner, Bernard Lonergan, , Bernard O'Brien and Richard De Smet.\n\nIn the same way, he proceeded to study the psychology of the mystics. Until his death on 11 December 1944 he taught philosophy and experimental psychology at the Jesuit House of Studies in Leuven (St Albert of Leuven's Philosophical and Theological College). He was a great friend of Pierre Scheuer, the Belgian Jesuit who has been described as a metaphysician and mystic.\n\n\n\n"}

He clashed with Wolfgang Schüssel on health care and immigration reform and with Jörg Haider on minority protection matters; he received praise from political opponents for his firm stance on human rights issues in general. Korinek has authored several books and more than 250 scholarly papers. Respected across party boundaries, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential legal scholars in recent Austrian history.\n\nKarl Korinek was born December 12, 1940 in Vienna as the son of Franz Korinek, a lawyer and future politician, and his wife Viktoria.\n\nKorinek grew up Catholic. The family was conservative; Korinek's father joined the Austrian People's Party after the end of World War II and went on to become General Secretary of the Austrian Economic Chamber, the national entrepreneurs' and industrialists' advocacy group; he later also served as the minister of finance for a term.\n\nKorinek received his secondary education at the Gymnasium Mariahilf, a school with special emphasis on the classical humanities.\n\nFollowing his graduation from the gymnasium in 1958, Korinek enrolled at the University of Vienna to study law, receiving his doctorate in 1963. He spent the next year working as a trainee at various Viennese courts. In 1964, he went to work as an in-house legal consultant for the Austrian Economic Chamber. In addition to his day job in the bureaucracy, Korinek continued to pursue an academic career. In 1970, he submitted his habilitation thesis to the Faculty of Legal and Political Science () at the University of Salzburg. In 1973, he left the Chamber to accept an appointment to full professor of public law () at the University of Graz. After three years in Graz, Korinek returned to the capital to become a professor at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, a position he held until he moved on to the University of Vienna in 1995.\n\nStarting in 1997, he also taught at the Danube University Krems.\n\nIn addition to his academic commitments, Korinek held a considerable number of extramural positions. From 1986 to 1992, Korinek was president of the Austrian Standards Institute; from 1987 to 2002, he also sat on the board of the Deutsches Institut für Normung.\nIn 1999, he became a member of the board of directors of the Vienna State Opera. He also served on the boards of directors of a number of publicly traded companies and NGOs,\nmost notably the Uniqa Insurance Group and the ERSTE Foundation.\n\nIn 1998, he was invited to join the Austrian Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn 1978, Korinek was appointed to the Austrian Constitutional Court. He was promoted to vice president of the court in 1999, to president in 2003. Korinek retired from his university positions and from most other responsibilities when he assumed the presidency. He kept his seat on the board of the State Opera, a side job that was particularly dear to him.\n\nIn early 2003, the cabinet of then-Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel launched the Austria Convention (), a conference of legal scholars and public intellectuals tasked with drafting a new constitution for Austria. The existing constitution, exceptionally bulky and difficult to navigate, had been posing serious technical challenges to legislators and constitutional justices for decades. The Convention was charged with exploring reform.\nKorinek was a member of the Convention from its launch to its conclusion in 2005.\n\nEffective May 2008, Korinek retired from the court, citing health reasons.\n\nOver the course of his career, Korinek wrote several books and more than 250 scholarly articles.\n\nKorinek died on March 9, 2017, after a protracted struggle with heart disease.\n\nKorinek is acknowledged as having been one of the Constitutional Court's most influential members during his tenure; he may in fact have been one of the court's most influential members in the institution's entire history.\nEven before he was appointed president of the court, Korinek has had more impact on the court's jurisprudence than would have been typical for a regular member.\nCommentators credit Korinek with having played a significant role in modernizing the tribunal's jurisprudence on constitutional rights questions;\nthe court itself agrees.\nKorinek is also credited for the fact that the court, under his leadership, has softened its traditional commitment to judicial restraint and has grown more assertive, protecting human rights principles more energetically and striking down laws more often.\n\nKorinek has also been noted for his impact as an educator. Commentators have called him \"one of the greats\" of Austrian legal instruction. Korinek is said to have played a prominent role in shaping the minds of several generations of Austrian jurists.\n\nHe has been called the \"doyen\" of Austrian legal scholarship\nand one of the most distinguished personalities in the country's legal history.\n\nKorinek was regarded as a committed conservative.\nLike his father before him, he joined the Austrian People's Party; he remained a card-carrying supporter when he was appointed to the Constitutional Court and only withdrew from membership when he was promoted to president.\nHe also was a member of the Cartellverband.\n\nThroughout his life, Korinek remained a devout Catholic.\nHe was active in the Vienna Catholic Academy () and in the Association of Catholic Graduates ().\nKorinek credited his Christianity in general and Thomas Aquinas in particular with having materially influenced his legal philosophy.\n\nKorinek's promotion to president of the Constitutional Court was part of an attempt by then-Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel to move the court to the right.\nHis outspoken conservatism and the circumstances of his promotion nonwithstanding, Korinek quickly acquired a reputation for integrity and non-partisan jurisprudence; he came to be widely respected across party lines.\nDuring Korinek's tenure as its president, the Constitutional Court overturned several key pieces of Schüssel's legislative agenda. Also during Korinek's presidency, the court sided with Slovenian minority right activists in the , a long-running dispute about Slovenian language rights that Jörg Haider's Freedom Party had been using to stoke populist resentment. The decision, easily the most controversial in the institution's history, earned Korinek Haider's and the Freedom Party's lasting enmity.\n\nKorinek became known for a number of signature positions that received praise from both sides of the political spectrum.\nHe advocated for transparency in government, called for an overhaul of Austria's outsized and convoluted constitution, and demanded that legislators put craftsmanship before ideology in drafting statutes.\nHe also took a firm stance against government encroachments on constitutional rights.\nAfter his retirement, he became a vocal critic of online surveillance, especially of government-mandated online data retention.\nHis criticism of Austria's data retention program proved well founded when, in 2014, the European Court of Justice declared it illegal under European human rights rules.\n\nKorinek supported Andreas Khol in the 2016 Austrian presidential election.\n\nKorinek was married for most of his adult life. He was survived by two children.\n\nKorinek was passionate about music. He sang in the Vienna State Opera choir in his student days; he remained involved in State Opera life throughout his career and well into retirement.\nStarting in 1999, he served on the board of directors of the opera, one of a handful of positions he did not retire from even when he was made the president of the Constitutional Court.\nKorinek authored books on the relationship between government and the arts, on Joseph Haydn, and on the , a comic opera by Richard Strauss. In an interview, Korinek compared the work of a legislator to that of a composer: both are striving to combine clarity with harmony, a parallel that Korinek claimed used to be widely discussed and acknowledged in the past.\n\nKorinek also published a book on the life and times of Julius Raab, which became a local bestseller.\n\n\n\n"}

They were used extensively during the 18th and 19th centuries and featured regularly scheduled service.\n\nWhen such ships were put into use in the 18th century on the Atlantic Ocean between Great Britain and its colonies, the services were called the packet trade.\n\nPacket craft were used extensively in European coastal mail services since the 17th century, and gradually added cramped passenger accommodation. As early as 1629, the Dutch East India Company was carrying some passengers on the ill-fated \"Batavia\" from Texel in Holland to Java. Later, scheduled services were offered, but the time journeys took depended much on the weather. They are even found to be a subject of Daniel Defoe's 1724 novel \"\". In England the King maintained a weekly packet service with the continent and Ireland using 15 packet vessels. Their importance was evident in the Rose Hill Packet becoming the first craft built in the colony of New South Wales in 1789.\n\nOver the two centuries of the sailing packet craft development, they came in various rig configurations which included: schooners, schooners-brigs, sloops, cutters, brigs, brigantines, luggers, feluccas, galleys, xebecs, barques and their ultimate development in the clipper ships. Earlier they were also known as dispatch boats, but the service was also provided by privateers during time of war, and on occasion chartered private yachts. News of \"record passages\" was eagerly awaited by the public, and the craft's captain and crew were often celebrated in the press. Behind this search for sailing faster than the wind however lay the foundations for a development in naval architecture and its science which would serve until the appearance of the steam vessels.\n\nIn 1863, during the Civil War, the packet boat \"Marshall\" carried the body of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson from Lynchburg to his home in Lexington, Virginia for burial.\n\nThe American canal packet boats were typically narrow (about 14 feet) to accommodate canals, but might be 70–90 feet long. When the Erie Canal opened in New York state in 1825 along the Mohawk River, demand quickly rose for travelers to be accommodated. Canal packet boats included cabin space for up to 60 passengers. Unlike European and American sailing vessels, that sought to attain greater speed under sail, the canal packet boats were drawn through the Erie Canal by teams of two or three horses or mules. Compared to overland travel, the boats cut journey time in half and were much more comfortable. Travelers could get from New York City to Buffalo in ten days, with a combination of sailing and packet boats. Some passengers took the boats to see both the Erie Canal and the natural landscapes. Significantly, thousands of others used packet boats to emigrate to Ohio and other parts of the Midwest. These boats were also instrumental in the settling of and travel within Upstate New York through the branch canals such as the Chenango Canal.\nPacket boats were also popular along the James River and Kanawha Canal in Virginia, allowing travel beyond the falls upriver.\n\n\"Mail steamers\" were steamships which carried the mail across waterways, such as across an ocean or between islands, primarily during the 19th century and early 20th century, when the cost of sending a letter was declining to the point an ordinary person could afford the cost of sending a letter across great distances. In addition to carrying mail, most mail steamers carried passengers or cargo since the revenue from the mail service, if any, was insufficient by itself to pay for the cost of its travel.\n\nHowever, the advantage for a steamship carrying mail was that its arrival would be advertised in advance in the newspapers, thus giving it \"free advertising\" as a travel option for passengers or cargo. In most cases, mail carried by mail steamers was delivered to the post office to which it was addressed. In some cases, the incoming mail would be advertised in the local newspaper for pickup at the post office or at the steamship's office for a fee, if not already fee-paid.\n\nOccasionally, because of political instability when a post office could not provide normal services, incoming mail from a mail steamer would be delivered to a local delivery service, which would deliver the mail and charge the addressee an extra fee for the service. When this occurred, the local delivery service would place its own local service stamp or mark on the envelope when the extra fee was paid.\n\nMail carried by these steamers – sometimes known as paquebot mail – was subject to various regulations by the governments involved as well as the Universal Postal Union's (UPU) regulations stated at the UPU Vienna Conference of 1891.\n\nThe C-82 Packet twin-engined, twin-boom cargo aircraft designed and built by Fairchild Aircraft was named as a tribute to the packet boat. It was used by the United States Army Air Forces and the successor United States Air Force following World War II.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1889033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889033", "title": "Prophecy of Seventy Weeks", "text": "Prophecy of Seventy Weeks\n\nThe Prophecy of Seventy Weeks is a passage in the Book of Daniel (chapter 9) in which the angel Gabriel explains to Daniel the meaning of Jeremiah, who had written that the \"desolation\" of Jerusalem would be completed after 70 years (Jeremiah 29:10 and 25:11-12). Daniel turns to God and asks when Jeremiah's word is to be accomplished. Gabriel comes to explain that the 70 years of Jeremiah will in fact be 70 \"sevens\", and gives a cryptic summary of what will happen during this time. The prophecy has proved notoriously difficult for interpreters, leading to its reputation as the \"dismal swamp\" of critical exegesis.\n\nIn the first year of Darius the Mede, Daniel reads in Jeremiah that the desolation of Jerusalem would be completed after seventy years (verses 1-2). He prays to God to end his anger and let his face shine upon the desolate sanctuary: \"O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, listen and act and do not delay!\" (verses 3-19). The angel Gabriel appears and tells Daniel that he has come to give wisdom and understanding, for at the beginning of Daniel's prayer a \"word\" went out. (verses 20-23) The angel then gives this revelation (verses 24-27):\n\nThe consensus among critical scholars is that chapters 1-6 of the Book of Daniel originated as a collection of folktales among the Jewish diaspora in the Persian/Hellenistic periods, to which the visionary chapters 7–12 were added during the persecution of the Jews under Antiochus IV in 167–163 BCE. The authors of the tales apparently took the name Daniel from a legendary hero mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel, and the author of the visions in the second half in turn adopted him from the tales.\n\nOld Testament scholar John J. Collins observes that chapter 9 can be distinguished from the second half of the Book of Daniel by the following two facts: (1) the point of departure for the chapter is another biblical text in Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy as opposed to a visionary episode, and (2) more than half the chapter is devoted to a rather lengthy prayer. Accordingly, Collins divides the chapter into an introductory section that mentions Daniel's reading of Jeremiah's prophecy (verses 1-2), the penitential prayer given by Daniel (verses 3-19), and the prophecy given by the angel Gabriel following the aforementioned prayer (verses 20-27)—with a more detailed outline given below:\n\nThe angelic revelation is a midrash or pesher (traditional Jewish interpretation of) a passage from the Jewish scriptures which Daniel has been reading. The author of Daniel does not identify the passage, but it is probably Jeremiah 29:10, in which Jeremiah, or rather God through the prophet, makes a promise of restoration for Israel after Babylon's 70 years: \"When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place.\" Jeremiah 25:11-12 also refers to Babylon's seventy years: \"This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years; then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, says the Lord, making the land an everlasting waste.\"\n\nModern critical scholars have sometimes argued that Daniel's prayer in verses 3-19 is secondary to chapter 9, as it contrasts sharply with the difficult Hebrew that is characteristic of Daniel. Still, it might be that the author(s) of the chapter incorporated (or adapted) a traditional prayer in the course of composition, in which case the prayer would not be a later addition. Proponents of the view that the prayer is secondary argue that (1) the context requires a prayer of illumination and not a communal confession of sin, and (2) the beginning and end of the prayer are marked by duplications in verses 3-4a and verses 20-21a that are most plausibly interpreted as redactional seams. However, these considerations have not proved decisive, and arguments in favor of the prayer's authenticity have also been advanced. In particular, the concluding passage in verses 20-27 contains several allusions to the language in the prayer, suggesting that it was included purposefully by the author(s) of the chapter, even if it was not originally composed by them.\n\nIt has also been argued that there is a \"pre-Maccabean core\" to the prophetic revelation delivered by Gabriel in verses 24-27, and that certain linguistic inconsistencies between the seventy weeks prophecy and other Danielic passages suggest that the second century BCE author(s)/redactor(s) of the Book of Daniel took over and modified a preexisting oracle that was already in circulation at the time of composition. These ideas have been further developed to suggest that the different redactional layers represented in this text reflect different eschatological perspectives, with the earliest one going back to a priest named Daniel who accompanied Ezra from Babylon to Jerusalem in the fifth century BCE and the latest one to an unnamed redactor who edited this prophecy in the second century BCE so that it would function (along with other parts of the Book of Daniel) as part of \"a prophetic manifesto for world domination.\" It is also argued that the prophecy exhibited a high degree of literary structure at an earlier stage of its development in such a way that the six infinitival clauses of verse 24 were chiastically linked to six divisions of verses 25-27 via an elaborate system of word counts, resulting in the following reconstruction of this earlier redactional stratum:\n\nThe seventy weeks prophecy is an \"ex eventu\" prophecy in periodized form whose \"Sitz im Leben\" is the Antiochene crisis in the second century BCE, with content analogous to the Enochic \"Apocalypse of Weeks\" as well as the \"Animal Apocalypse\". In this way, the prophecy puts the Antiochene crisis in perspective by locating it within an overview of history; the specificity of the prediction is significant for the psychological effect of the revelation, which has long been recognized as a distinctive characteristic of Daniel's prophecies (cf. \"Ant.\" 10.11.7 § 267). The prophecy is also an instance of Jewish apocalyptic literature, as it belongs to the genre of revelatory literature in which a revelation is mediated to a human recipient in Daniel by an otherworldly being in the angel Gabriel that envisages eschatological salvation. Within the macro-genre of Jewish apocalyptic literature, the prophecy further belongs to the subgenre known as the \"historical apocalypse,\" which is characterized by the use of \"ex eventu\" prophecy and the presence of an interpreting angel.\n\nThe lengthy prayer in verses 3-19 is strongly Deuteronomic in its theology—Daniel's people are punished for their own sin and appeal to God for mercy. However, such theological overtones conflict with other aspects of the Book of Daniel, in which the primary sin is that of a gentile king and the course of history is arranged in advance. Consequently, scholars have variously argued that the angel ignores Daniel's prayer and that the author(s) is making the point that \"the calamity is decreed and will end at the appointed time, quite apart from prayers,\" and/or that the prayer is not intended to influence God but is \"an act of piety in itself.\" As Collins observes, \"[t]he deliverance promised by the angel is in no sense a response to Daniel's prayer\" since \"[t]he word goes forth at the beginning of Daniel's supplication.\" In any case, the relationship between Daniel's prayer and the context in which it is placed, is a central issue in the contemporary scholarly interpretation of chapter 9.\n\nNebuchadnezzar II defeated Egypt at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE and established Babylon as the dominant regional power, with significant consequences for the southern kingdom of Judah. Following a revolt in 597 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar removed Judah's king, Jehoiachin; and after a second revolt in 586 BCE, he destroyed the city of Jerusalem along with the Temple of Solomon, carrying away much of the population to Babylon. Accordingly, the subsequent period from 586 BCE to 538 BCE is known as the Babylonian exile, which came to an end when Babylon was conquered by the Persian king Cyrus the Great, who allowed the Jewish exiles to return to Judah via his famous edict of restoration. The Persian period, in turn, came to an end in the first half of the fourth century BCE following the arrival of Alexander the Great, whose vast kingdom was divided upon his death among the Diadochi. The series of conflicts that ensued following Alexander's death in the wars that erupted among the Diadochi mark the beginning of the Hellenistic period in 323/2 BCE. Two of the rival kingdoms produced out of this conflict—the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt and the Seleucid dynasty in Syria—fought for control of Palestine during the Hellenistic period.\n\nAt the start of the second century BCE, the Seleucids had the upper hand in their struggle with the Ptolemaic kingdom for regional dominance, but the earlier conflicts had left them nearly bankrupt. The Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV attempted to recoup some of his kingdom's fortunes by selling the post of Jewish high priest to the highest bidder, and in 171/0 BCE the existing high priest (i.e. Onias III) was deposed and murdered. Palestine was subsequently divided between those who favored the Hellenistic culture of the Seleucids and those who remained loyal to the older Jewish traditions; however, for reasons that are still not understood, Antiochus IV banned key aspects of traditional Jewish religion in 168/7 BCE—including the twice-daily continual offering (cf. Dan 8:13; 11:31; 12:11).\n\nThe seventy weeks prophecy is internally dated to \"the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, by birth a Mede\" (verse 1), elsewhere referred to within the Book of Daniel as \"Darius the Mede\" (e.g. Dan 11:1); however, no such ruler is known to history independently of the Book of Daniel and the widespread consensus among critical scholars is that he is a literary fiction of some kind. Nevertheless, within the fictionalized biblical account, the first year of Darius the Mede corresponds to the first year after the Babylonian kingdom is overthrown.\n\nChapter 9 can be distinguished from the other \"visionary\" chapters of the Book of Daniel by the fact that the point of departure for this chapter is another biblical text in Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy and not a visionary episode. The longstanding consensus among critical scholars has been that verses 24-27 is a paradigmatic example of inner-biblical interpretation, in which the latter text reinterprets Jeremiah's seventy years of exile as seventy weeks of years. On this view, Jeremiah's prophecy that after seventy years God would punish the Babylonian kingdom (cf. Jer 25:12) and once again pay special attention to his people in responding to their prayers and restoring them to the land (cf. Jer 29:10-14) could not have been fulfilled by the disappointment that accompanied the return to the land in the Persian period, hence the necessity to extend the expiration date of the prophecy to the second century BCE. And just as various elements of Daniel's visionary episodes are interpreted for him in chapters 7–8, so also Jeremiah's prophecy is interpreted for him in a manner similar to the \"pesher\" exegesis evidenced at Qumran in chapter 9. However, this consensus has recently been challenged on the grounds that Daniel prays to God following the defeat of the Babylonian kingdom precisely because Jeremiah's seventy years of exile have been completed and God promised through the prophet that he would respond to such prayers at this time, in which case the seventy weeks prophecy is not a reinterpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy but a separate prophecy altogether. And these considerations have been further refined along redactional lines to suggest that the latter holds relative to an earlier \"pre-canonical\" stage in the text, but that the seventy weeks prophecy is, in fact, a reinterpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy relative to the final form of the text.\n\nThe seventy \"weeks\" of years are divided into three periods of time: a seven-week period spanning forty-nine years, a sixty-two-week period spanning 434 years, and a final period of one week spanning seven years. The first period of seven weeks begins with the departure of a \"word\" to rebuild Jerusalem and ends with the arrival of an \"anointed prince\" (verse 25a). This \"word\" to rebuild Jerusalem has generally been taken to refer to Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy and dated to the fourth year of Jehoiakim (or the first year of Nebuchadnezzar) in 605/4 BCE. Collins objects to this identification on the basis that \"[t]he word to rebuild Jerusalem could scarcely have gone forth before it was destroyed\" and prefers to see this as a reference to the \"word\" that Gabriel came to give Daniel in verse 23; other possible candidates suggested by critical scholars include the edict of Cyrus in 539/8 BCE, the decree of Artaxerxes I in 458/7 BCE, and the warrant given to Nehemiah in 445/4 BCE. The \"prince\" in verse 25a may refer to either an actual prince or some other figure of authority and critical scholars have proposed various candidates here as well, including Cyrus (cf. Isa 45:1), High Priest Joshua, Zerubbabel, Sheshbazzar, Ezra, Nehemiah, the angelic \"prince\" Michael (cf. Dan 10:21b), and even the collective people of God in the Second Temple period.\n\nAn \"anointed one shall be cut off\" (verse 26a) following the subsequent period of sixty-two weeks during which time the city is rebuilt (verse 25b); this \"anointed one\" is generally considered to refer to the murdered High Priest Onias III, whose death at the hands of Seleucid officials outside Jerusalem in 171/0 BCE is recorded in 2 Maccabees 4:23-28. Most critical scholars see another reference to Onias III's murder in Daniel 11:22, though Ptolemy VI and the infant son of Seleucus IV have also been suggested. On the other hand, the identification of the latter \"anointed one\" with Onias III raises the question of how 7 + 62 = 69 weeks of years (or 483 years) could have elapsed between the departure of the \"word\" in verse 25a—which is not earlier than 605/4 BCE—and the murder of Onias III in 171/0 BCE. Hence, some critical scholars follow Montgomery in thinking that there has been \"a chronological miscalculation on [the] part of the writer,\" who is then criticized for making \"wrong-headed arithmetical calculations;\" while others like Goldingay are not inclined to see this as a \"chronological miscalculation\" on the basis that the seventy weeks are not an exercise in literal chronology, but the more inexact science of \"chronography.\" Collins opts for something like a middle-ground position in saying that \"the figure should be considered a round number rather than a miscalculation.\" And there are still others who see the calculations as being at least approximately correct so long as the initial seven-week period of forty-nine years can overlap with the sixty-two-week period of 434 years, with the latter period spanning the time between Jeremiah's prophecy in 605/4 BCE and Onias III's murder in 171/0 BCE.\n\nThe \"prince who is to come\" in verse 26b is typically seen by critical scholars as a reference to Antiochus IV, though Jason and Menelaus have also been suggested. Hence, the \"troops of the prince\" are either thought to be the Seleucid troops that settled in Jerusalem (cf. Dan 11:31; 1 Macc 1:29-40) or the Jewish hellenizers. In any case, the reference to \"troops\" that will \"destroy the city and the sanctuary\" in verse 26b is somewhat problematic on this view since neither Jerusalem nor the temple were actually destroyed during the Antiochene crisis, though the city was arguably rendered desolate and the temple defiled (cf. 1 Macc 1:46; 2 Macc 6:2). Accordingly, it has been noted that the language of destruction \"seems excessive\" in this context.\n\nThe \"covenant\" in verse 27a most likely refers to the \"covenant\" reported in 1 Maccabees 1:11 between the Jewish hellenizers and Antiochus IV, with the ban on regular worship for a period that lasted approximately three and a half years alluded to in the subsequent clause (cf. Dan 7:25; 8:14; 12:11). In contrast, the reference to an \"abomination that desolates\" in verse 27b (cf. 1 Macc 1:54) is another point of contention among critical scholars. One of the more popular older views was that this difficult phrase was a contemptuous deformation (or dysphemism) of the Phoenician deity Baal Shamin—the \"Lord of Heaven\"—whom Philo of Byblos identified with the Greek sky god Zeus. Moreover, the temple in Jerusalem was rededicated in honor of Zeus according to 2 Maccabees 6:2, hence the tendency among older commentators to follow Porphyry in seeing this \"abomination\" in terms of a statue of Zeus. More recently, it has been suggested that the reference is to certain sacred stones (possibly meteorites) that were affixed to the great altar of sacrifice for the purposes of pagan worship in the temple, since the use of such stones is well-attested in Canaanite and Syrian cults. However, both sorts of proposals have been criticized on the basis that they are either too speculative, dependent on flawed analysis, or not well-suited to the relevant context in the Book of Daniel. Increasingly, critical scholars tend to see the expression as being a reference to either the pagan offerings that were given during the Antiochene crisis instead of the twice-daily continual offering that had been forbidden (cf. Dan 11:31; 12:11; 2 Macc 6:5), or the pagan altar on which such offerings were made.\n\nThere is a long-standing tradition within Christianity of reading the 70 weeks as a prophecy of the coming of Jesus, but Christian exegetes have differed widely over such details as which passages refer to the Messiah, when the \"sevens\" begin and end, and how the final \"week\" relates to those preceding. Many denominations consider Antiochus IV Epiphanes to be irrelevant to the interpretation of the seventy weeks, whereas others recognise Antiochus' period as the literal interpretation with a secondary \"typical\" application to Christ.\n\nThe various christological readings that have been proposed share a number of features: The \"anointed prince\" in verse 25a or the \"anointed one\" in verse 26a (or both) are understood to refer to Christ, who is also sometimes thought to be the \"most holy\" thing anointed in verse 24. Some of the early church fathers also associated Christ with the \"prince who is to come\" (verse 26b), but this figure is more often identified with either the Antichrist or one of the Roman officials who oversaw the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE (e.g. Titus or Vespasian). The \"abomination that desolates\" is typically read in the context of the New Testament use of the expression in the Olivet Discourse, with various interpretations.\n\nThe seven- and sixty-two-week periods are generally understood as consecutive, non-overlapping periods starting with an event during the reign of Artaxerxes I and ending with the Jesus' baptism and anointing with Holy Spirit. The specific event during the reign of Artaxerxes I that is said to mark the beginning of the 70 weeks varies by denomination. For example, some identify it with the decree given to Ezra by Artaxerxes I in 458/7 BCE, and some specify the warrant given to Nehemiah in 445/4 BCE. In the latter case, the period is reduced to 476 years by applying 360-day \"prophetic\" (or \"Chaldean\") years, based on biblical passages such as Revelation 12:6, 14.\n\nVarious Christian scholars have interpreted the Prophecy of 70 Weeks since around the third century CE.\n\nIn the futurist view, the seventieth week is separated from the sixty-ninth week by a long period of time known as the church age. The seventieth week then begins at the end of the church age, at which point the church will be removed from the earth in an event called the rapture. The future Antichrist is expected to oppress the Jewish people and bring upon the world a period of tribulation lasting three and a half years, constituting the second half of the delayed seventieth week. This interpretation was first popularized by John Nelson Darby.\n\nIn the historicist view, the seventieth week immediately follows the sixty-ninth week. The end of the 70th week is associated with the gospel being redirected from only the Jews to all the nations. Proponents of the historicist interpretation include theologian Francis Nigel Lee, and denominations derived the 19th century Millerite movement, including the Seventh-day Adventist Church and Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nThe reference to an anointed one being \"cut off\" in verse 26a is identified with death of Christ 3½ years after his baptism, and has traditionally been thought to mark the midpoint of the seventieth week, and associated with the confirmation of Jeremiah's new \"covenant\" (verse 27a) and making atonement for \"iniquity\" (verse 24).\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that the 70 weeks begin with Nehemiah receiving permission to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes I, which they assign to 455 BCE (ten years earlier than his actual 20th year). The sixty-ninth week ends at Jesus' baptism in 29 CE, he is executed in 33CE, and the final week ends with the conversion of Cornelius in 36 CE.\n\nIn the Seventh-day Adventist interpretation, the 70 weeks begin with the decree by Artaxerxes I in 458/7 BCE to provide money to rebuild Jerusalem and its temple, the 69th week ends in 27 CE with Jesus' baptism, he is 'cut off' (executed) in 31 CE, and the final week ends in 34 CE.\n\n\n\n"}

Hart is a member of the Hart wrestling family and the second youngest son of Stu and Helen Hart. He is best known for his work in Stampede Wrestling and several appearances in WWE, often with his siblings Bruce, Keith, Bret, Diana and Owen Hart.\n\nHart is of Irish descent through his maternal grandfather and Greek descent through his maternal grandmother. His father was mainly of Scots-Irish descent but also had Scottish and English ancestry. Hart is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States due to his mother Helen Hart being from New York. Hart grew up in a household with 11 siblings, Smith, Bruce, Keith, Wayne, Dean, Ellie, Georgia, Bret, Alison, Diana and Owen.\n\nHart's middle name was given to him in honor of his father's longtime friend Luther Lindsay and he was the godson of wrestler and promoter Jack Pfefer. Hart has stated that his earliest memory is hearing his father Stu training wrestlers in their family basement, known as The Dungeon. Hart's first experience working for his father's promotion Stampede Wrestling was selling programs for the shows when he was six years old. Hart is a childhood friend of fellow wrestler Milad Elzein who is the same age, he would sometimes help Hart sell the programs before the Stampede shows when they were young.\n\nIn the 80s Hart wrestled for the original Stampede Wrestling having matches with wrestlers such as Drago Zhivago, Cuban Assassin, Gerry Morrow, Biff Wellington, Jude Rosenbloom, Chris Benoit, Goldie Rogers, Steve Blackman, Steve DiSalvo, Vokhan Singh, Great Gama, Mike Hammer, Beef Wellington, Mr. Hito, Vladimir Krupoff, Adolph Barbee, George Skaaland and brother in-law BJ Annis. Hart worked in tag team matches with Keiichi Yamada, Ken Johnson, George Skaaland and Johnny Smith as well as with his brothers Bruce against the Cuban Commandos. He participated in three-man tag team matches with his younger brother Owen and brother in-law Ben Bassarab against Drago Thomas, Gama Singh and Vladimir Krupoff as well. During this period he also took part in battle royales with many of the aforementioned wrestlers and competed for the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship.\n\nIn the 80s Hart worked in the UK and wrestled on the program World of Sport in singles matches against Marty Jones and in tag team matches with his brother Owen against Fit Finlay and Rocky Moran, they performed as faces. Ross and Owen toured most of Europe together in 1983. Hart shortly worked for WWF in the 90's and appeared on the television program WWF Wrestling Challenge under the ring name Ross Lindsey. During his time there he mostly wrestled Ted DiBiase in singles matches and tag teamed with Mike Pocari against The Orient Express, with Barry Hardy against Power And Glory or with Mike Morgan and Ron Cumberledge against Demolition. In 1994 hart worked for All Star Wrestling in England for a short period. He wrestled in victorious singles matches with Red Bronco, Johnny Angel, Duke Lynch, Count Von Zuppi, Drew McDonald. Duke Lynch being the only one he wrestled more than once. At the 1994 SummerSlam Hart can be seen attempting to climb the cage in which his brothers Bret and Owen Hart had their match together with other members of the Hart family.\n\nHart continued to wrestle sporadically for the 1999-2007 incarnation of Stampede Wrestling, having matches with wrestlers such as Rod Rage, Juggernaut, Cuban Assassin, Ryan Evans and Apocalypse before retiring in 2005. Hart appeared again for WWF (now renamed WWE) in an in ring capacity at WrestleMania XXVI, where he was a lumberjack for his brother Bret's first WWE match in 13 years, a No Holds Barred Lumberjack match against the WWE chairman Vince McMahon. The storyline was that McMahon had paid off Ross and the rest of the Hart family to betray Bret, but all of them turned on him and helped Bret win the match.\n\nHart worked as a Television Producer on the original Stampede Wrestling. Hart together with his brother Bruce relaunched their father's Stampede Wrestling promotion in 1999. Ross usually handled promotion in the smaller Alberta towns such as Hanna, Didsbury and Cochrane while Bruce took care of Ogden Legion. At this time the Hart brothers also handled at the Hart Brothers Wrestling Camp where they would train students, often with help from their father Stu and occasionally other relatives. In 2005 Hart worked as senior advisor and commissioner for Celtic Pro Wrestling in Ireland.\n\nRoss and his brother Bruce started the Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame together. Together they also owned the copyright to many of the Stampede Wrestling tapes, some of which they gave to their brother Bret and some who they sold to WWE. Ross helped design his niece Natalya's ring costume, he criticized how revealing the original version was and opted to change it. In 2014 Ross inducted long time wrestling photographer Bob Leonard into the High Impact Wrestling Hall of Fame. Hart appeared on WWE television on stage together with all his living siblings when his father Stu Hart was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Ross and his brother Smith were present for the induction of their father into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2014. In 2017 Hart served together with his older brother Bret as part of the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum's Distinguished Selection Committee, the committee decides which wrestlers will be inducted for that following year. During that year Hart inducted fellow Canadian Yvon Robert to the Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2006 Hart portrayed Humphrey Bogart in a theatrical rendition of \"Play It Again, Sam\" at the Workshop Theatre in Calgary.\n\nHart has appeared in several documentaries, including \"\", \"\", \"\" which are all about his brother Bret, as well as the Hart family documentary \"\" and 2016's \"Hart Still Beating\", which is about his brother Smith and nephew Matt. Outside of documentaries about Harts's family he has also appeared in \"\".\n\nIn 2008 Hart appeared on the \"E!\" Chris Benoit special after Benoit's death. In 2015 Hart appeared alongside his sister Diana on Shaw TV to speak about their father Stu's one hundredth birthday.\n\nRoss's niece Lindsay Hart who is a make up artist and wrestling personality is named after his middle name. In July 4, 1989 Hart was involved in an automobile accident near Jasper, Alberta together with Davey Boy Smith, Chris Benoit, Karl Moffat and Tatsumi Kitahara. Hart who was in the driver's seat and wearing a seatbelt received minor injuries, Smith who was sitting next to him and not wearing a seabelt had his head smashed through the windsheld resulting in a wound which required one hundred stitches. Karl Moffat was injured the most, one of his ankles was crushed by the spare tire. After the incident Moffat attempted to sue Hart, claiming he had been crippled by the event, but he did not succeed in receiving any compensation since a moving company Moffat had worked for supplied evidence of him moving around reasonably well after the accident.\n\nHart appeared at the Cauliflower Alley Club reunion in Las Vegas in February 2001. Since the passing of Hart family patriarch and matriarch Stu and Helen Hart, the traditional Sunday dinner is held at Ross' home. Hart has long been candid about the scripted nature of professional wrestling and approved of the Calgarian civic committee's decision to exclude it from its combative sports bylaw in 2006. In 2008 Ross Hart encouraged the city of Calgary to renovate but preserve his childhood home in its original form, this was eventually done between 2010 and 2012. Ross is the Hart family's historian and has an encyclopedic knowledge of the wrestling business according to his brother Bret and journalists Dave Meltzer.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30829222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30829222", "title": "Sergiu Dan", "text": "Sergiu Dan\n\nSergiu Dan (; born Isidor Rotman or Rottman; December 29, 1903 – March 13, 1976) was a Romanian novelist, journalist, Holocaust survivor and political prisoner of the communist regime. Dan, the friend and collaborator of Romulus Dianu, was noted during the interwar period as a contributor to Romania's avant-garde and modernist scene, collaborating with poet Ion Vinea on \"Contimporanul\" review and \"Facla\" newspaper. He was also affiliated with the rival literary club, \"Sburătorul\", and noted for criticizing the communist sympathies of other avant-garde writers. His main works of the 1930s include contributions to the psychological novel, thriller and political novel genres, received with critical acclaim.\n\nOf Jewish Romanian origin, Sergiu Dan was the subject of antisemitic defamation, and, during World War II, was deported to Transnistria. After his return home, Dan spoke about his experiences in the book \"Unde începe noaptea\" (\"Where Night Begins\"), which endures one of the few Romanian contributions to Holocaust literature, and has for long been censored by dictatorial regimes. The writer's political stance also clashed with the post-1948 communist establishment, and, during the 1950s, he was interned at Aiud prison. Dan was eventually forced to adapt his writing style to the aesthetic requirements of Romanian Socialist realism, and spent the final decades of his life in relative obscurity. His work was rediscovered and reassessed following the 1989 Revolution.\n\nThe future writer was born in the town of Piatra Neamț, in Moldavia region, the son of Simon Rotman. His first steps in cultural journalism happened before 1926, when he was affiliated with the newspaper \"Cugetul Românesc\"; his earliest poems were published in cultural magazines such as \"Chemarea\" and \"Flacăra\", and a debut novella, \"Iudita și Holofern\" (\"Judith and Holofernes\"), saw print in 1927. Sergiu Dan's brother, Mihail Dan, was also a journalist, known for his translations from Soviet author Vladimir Mayakovsky.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Sergiu Dan and his friend Romulus Dianu were in Bucharest. It was there that Dan joined the literary circle of novelist Camil Petrescu, and took part in the regular literary disputes at Casa Capșa and Corso restaurants. By 1928, he had fallen out with Petrescu: ridiculing the \"noocratic\" philosophical project outlined by Petrescu, and calling its author \"insane\" and \"poltroonish\". He later expressed regret for the incident, noting that he had been especially amused by Petrescu's eccentric decision to store his philosophical manuscript in the Vatican Library.\n\nDan and Dianu were also co-opted by Ion Vinea on his various journalistic ventures, beginning with the left-wing and modernist literary review \"Contimporanul\", where they published avant-garde prose and poetry with a political subtext. His texts were featured in various other venues: \"Vremea\", \"Revista Fundațiilor Regale\", \"Universul Literar\" (the literary supplement of \"Universul\" daily) and \"Bilete de Papagal\" (the satirical newspaper of poet Tudor Arghezi). During the period, Dan underwent formal training in Economics, graduating from the Bucharest Commercial School. With Dianu (who was also making his debut), Dan co-authored a romanticized biography of the 19th century poet-storyteller Anton Pann: \"Viața minunată a lui Anton Pann\" (\"The Wonderful Life of Anton Pann\"; Editura Cultura Națională, 1929)—this collaborative fiction piece was reissued in 1935 as \"Nastratin și timpul său\" (\"Nasreddin and His Time\"). In this context, Dan also joined the \"Sburătorul\" club, formed around the eponymous magazine of literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu, as one of the Jewish writers whom Lovinescu welcomed into his movement.\n\nDuring his period at \"Contimporanul\", Dan embarked on a conflict with the Surrealist and far leftist group at \"unu\", the magazine of poet Sașa Pană. This controversy reflected the major discrepancies between \"Contimporanul\" and other avant-garde venues. By 1930, Sergiu's brother Mihail Dan had left \"Bilete de Papagal\" and had become involved with \"unu\", of which he was later editor in chief. However, documents first made public in 2008 show that he was secretly an informant for the Kingdom of Romania's intelligence agency, \"Siguranța Statului\", with a mission to supervise \"unu\"s ongoing flirtations with communism. He had for long been suspected of this by the literary society at \"Sburătorul\". Also in 1930, shortly after the forceful return of Romanian King Carol II to the throne, Sergiu Dan was working, as political editor, on the staff of \"Dreptatea\", the platform of the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ). According to the later account of communist journalist Petre Pandrea, Dan and Vinea together stole the original draft of an article by PNȚ economist Virgil Madgearu, and forged it in such manner as to make it seem that Madgearu was an anti-Carlist; they then sold a copy to Madgearu's rival, the corporatist theorist Mihail Manoilescu. Manoilescu took a copy of this document to Carol, discrediting himself when the forgery was exposed. Pandrea claimed that, between them, Dan and Vinea made off with 150,000 lei from the affair, whereas their victim Manoilescu fell into permanent disfavor.\n\nSergiu Dan's actual editorial debut came in 1931, when Editura Cugetarea published his novel \"Dragoste și moarte în provincie\" (\"Love and Death in the Provinces\"). In 1932, Dan and dramatist George Mihail Zamfirescu shared the annual prize of the Romanian Writers' Society, of which they both became members. In 1932, Sergiu Dan joined the staff of Vinea's gazette \"Facla\", with novelist Ion Călugăru, poet N. Davidescu, writer-director Sandu Eliad, and professional journalists Nicolae Carandino and Henric Streitman.\n\nDan resumed his writing career with \"Arsenic\", published by Cultura Națională in 1934, and \"Surorile Veniamin\" (\"The Veniamin Sisters\", Editura Vatra, 1935). The former volume received another cultural prize, granted by literary critics at the Eforie festival of 1934. During 1934, Dan was one of 46 intellectuals who signed an appeal in favor of normalizing relations between Romania and its communist enemy to the east, the Soviet Union—the basis for a cultural and political association, \"Amicii URSS\", which was secretly maneuvered by the outlawed Romanian Communist Party.\n\nSergiu Dan became a victim of antisemitic repression during the early stages of World War II, when authoritarian and fascist regimes took over (\"see Romania during World War II\"). Initially, he was expelled from the Writers' Society. In July 1940, writing for \"Universul Literar\", fascist author Ladmiss Andreescu proposed a boycott of Dan's work, and an overall ban on Jewish literature. Under the National Legionary State, some authors sympathetic to the ruling Iron Guard celebrated its enforcement of censorship as a revolution against modernist literature. In their magazine \"Gândirea\", Dan was referred to as an exponent of \"Judaic morbidity\". Dan escaped the Pogrom of January 1941, hidden and protected by his friend Vinea.\n\nLater, the new dictatorial government of \"Conducător\" Ion Antonescu listed Dan as one of the Jewish authors specifically banned, on a special inventory with nationwide circulation. Dan was also among the Jewish men and women who were deported to concentration camps in Romanian-administered Transnistria (\"see Holocaust in Romania\"); he was eventually released and could return to Bucharest, where he was under treatment with the Jewish physician and fellow writer Emil Dorian, before the August 1944 Coup managed to topple Antonescu.\n\nDealing with his Transnistrian deportation, the novel \"Unde începe noaptea\" was published by Editura Naționala Mecu in 1945. The book, written as a response to early signs of Holocaust denial, was reportedly taken out of circulation for unknown reasons; it was later suggested that it clashed with the Communist Party agenda, at a time when Romania was undergoing fast communization. Two years later, Naționala Mecu released another one of Dan's war-themed novels, \"Roza și ceilalți\" (\"Roza and the Others\").\n\nAfter 1948, Sergiu Dan's political views collided with the agenda set by the Romanian communist regime, and he was eventually arrested. Reportedly, Dan had first attracted political persecution upon himself when, in 1947, he spoke out as a defense witness at the trial of his friend, the PNȚ journalist Nicolae Carandino. The Securitate secret police confiscated his works in progress, which reputedly formed part of a special secret archive. The conditions of Dan's new detainment were characterized by literary historian Henri Zalis as \"savage\". He was notably held, with many other public figures of various backgrounds, at Aiud prison. Petre Pandrea, himself imprisoned there after an inner-party purge, later included Dan on his list of writers, humorously titled the \"Writers' Union of Aiud\"—in contrast to the communist-controlled Writers' Union of Romania. Dianu, who had worked with Vinea and controversial journalist Pamfil Șeicaru during the war years, was also in custody by 1950, as one of the journalists charged with having tarnished \"the world's luminous transformation on the path toward the justest regime in the history of mankind\".\n\nDan was eventually released around 1955, when, according to Zalis (a personal witness to the events, alongside novelist Zaharia Stancu), he confided to fellow members of the official Writers' Union about his time in prison. The Union later exposed Dan to sessions of \"self-criticism\", forcing him to comply with the demands of Socialist realism (\"see Socialist realism in Romania\"). His later bibliography includes: \"Taina stolnicesei\" (\"The Stolnik Woman's Secret\"), published by Editura de stat pentru literatură și artă (ESPLA) in 1958 and \"Tase cel Mare\" (\"Tase the Great\"), Editura pentru literatură, 1964.\n\nIn 1970, Editura Minerva republished \"Roza și ceilalți\" and \"Arsenic\", while Cartea Românească printed his last volume, \"Dintr-un jurnal de noapte\" (\"From a Nightly Diary\"). That year, in protest against communist censorship, Dan refused to accept the \"Meritul Cultural\" medal. He also concentrated on his translator's activity, being noted for his rendition of \"Madame Bovary\" and \"Salammbô\", the classical works of French novelist Gustave Flaubert. His overall contribution also covers Romanian-language versions of works by Louis Aragon, Michel Droit, Maurice Druon, Anatole France, Boris Polevoy, Elsa Triolet and Voltaire. In 1973, he was interviewed by the young literary critics Ileana Corbea and Nicolae Florescu for the volume \"Biografii posibile\" (\"Possible Biographies\").\n\nThe earliest literary contributions by Sergiu Dan are generally small-scale narratives about provincial life, which often lead to a fiery and unexpected climax. Those fragments published by \"Contimporanul\" in the 1920s have been included by researcher Paul Cernat in a special group of \"iconoclastic\" and absurdist short prose (with those of Dianu, F. Brunea-Fox, Filip Corsa or Sandu Tudor). His experimental prose fragment \"Rocambole\" was a parody of Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail's 19th century series (and of literary conventions in general): although only covering half a page, it carried the subtitle \"grand adventure novel\", and showed its eponymous anti-hero as an incestuous kleptomaniac. The inspiration behind this format, similar to those employed by Dianu and the others, was the avant-garde hero Urmuz. According to Cernat, the \"Contimporanul\" writers borrowed Urmuz's manner of toying with the expectations of traditional readers, but were less interested than him in preserving an implicit social message. Cernat illustrates this conclusion with Dan's free verse \"diary-poem\", published in Issue 71 of \"Contimporanul\", a sample of \"cynical libertinism\" and \"absolute aesthetic freedom\":\nA triple issue of \"Contimporanul\" (96-97-98 for 1931) featured Dan and Dianu's text for the stage, \"Comedie în patru acte\" (\"A Comedy in Four Acts\"). Cernat finds that it is a \"timid\" version of Futurist writings by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, comparable to similar contributions by A. L. Zissu.\n\nDan's style became more personal during his affiliation with \"Sburătorul\" and his earliest novels, although, Henri Zalis notes, he was more eclectic than other \"Sburătorists\". Researcher and critic Ovid Crohmălniceanu finds that Sergiu Dan was one of the psychological novelists who, following \"Sburătorul\"s critique of social determinism and praise of the liberated urban intellectual, focused primarily (and, in Crohmălniceanu's opinion, excessively) on the refined \"erotic obsessions\" of exceptional individuals. He therefore places Dan in a group of \"Sburătorists\" which also includes Felix Aderca, Isaia Răcăciuni, Mihail Celarianu and Dan Petrașincu. In his 1941 synthesis of Romanian literature, academic George Călinescu described the post-1931 novels written separately by Dianu and Dan as rather similar, with the exception that Dan's were the products of \"a more organized industry\"; both authors, he argues, remained \"highly conventional\" in applying to Romania the genre fiction equivalent of Hollywood films.\n\nOverall, Crohmălniceanu notes, Sergiu Dan had an \"offhand narrative style, moving around with ease, the same as [fellow novelist] Cezar Petrescu, in quite varied environments. A certain analytical lucidity [of his] betrays [...] an additional interest for the mystery of psychological mechanisms within his heroes' actions\". The shock value of avant-garde and libertinism is preserved in some of Dan's 1930s novels. Călinescu wrote that his characters generally lack \"even the slightest notion of virtue\", their \"flimsy mentality\" being the reason why Dan's novels always resemble \"comedies\". However, according to Crohmălniceanu, Dan's \"sharp intelligence\", \"delicate observation\" and love of aphorism compensated for \"the lack of any prolonged moral discretion.\"\n\nWhile the Anton Pann narrative earned appreciation for freely mixing picturesque elements into a historical novel framework, Dan's solo debut with \"Dragoste și moarte...\" takes direct inspiration from Gustave Flaubert. The book is seen by Ovid Crohmălniceanu as \"a good reconstruction of a particular human ambiance, with a suggestion regarding the forms of Bovarysme that envelop [the provincial] setting.\" The more complex \"Arsenic\" can be read, according to Crohmălniceanu, as both a thriller populated with \"dubious\" figures and, \"under careful reading\", a study \"on the petty cowardice of existence.\" The protagonist is a physician who renounces his professional standard, assists his friend, the simple giant Bibi, in plotting the murder of a common enemy, and then lives to regret his deed, while, at the same time, he betrays Bibi's confidence by pursuing an affair with his wife Ana; Ana however cheats on both men with the president of an insurance company. Călinescu remarks that the novel was constructed with an \"intelligent\" rhythm of suspense and humor, noting the \"fantasy\" invested in the secondary plots and characters: the colonel who dies obsessing about fodder, his bourgeois daughters, or the coroner who constructs absurd theories about criminal behavior. \"Arsenic\" received high praise from Crohmălniceanu: \"The book is written with much confidence, it displays remarkable intellectual detachment, fine Voltairian irony and an ingenious, irreproachable, counterpoint construction.\"\n\nIn \"Surorile Veniamin\", Dan's political novel, the narrative follows the symmetrical lives of two sisters: Felicia, who rejects social conformity and braves a life of poverty; and Maria, who works in the thriving oil industry and then becomes a kept woman. The plot is complicated by Felicia's affair with agitator Mihai Vasiliu, a Romanian Communist Party member who is pursued by \"Siguranța Statului\" agents, and who hides in Maria's apartment. Călinescu rated the more \"serious\" book as inferior to the \"flighty verve\" of \"Arsenic\". Crohmălniceanu believes the book displays qualities similar to \"Arsenic\"s, but notes that Vasiliu's ultimate arrest, which leaves both sisters unconsoled, leads the outcome into a \"disappointingly inconsistent\" solution.\n\nWith \"Unde începe noaptea\", Sergiu Dan spoke about his own experience as a victim of Nazism and of Ion Antonescu's regime, with additional detail on the January 1941 Pogrom. The book carries a motto from the freethinker Léon Bloy: \"Only Jewish tears are the heaviest. Theirs is the weight of many centuries.\" Centered on Jewish industrialist David Bainer, the narrative progresses over the slow degeneration into racial antisemitism, culminating in deportation.\n\nCrohmălniceanu noted: \"In grave pitch, the author manages, against previous expectations, to write a book as yet unparalleled in our literature, about Nazi extermination camps\". Literary critic John Neubauer and his co-authors listed Sergiu Dan among the few East-Central European authors to have been caught up in wartime \"carnage\" and survived (their list also includes, for Romania, political prisoner Tudor Arghezi and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel). They describe \"Unde începe...\" as \"a documentary novel about life in the concentration camp\", one of the first-generation East-Central European books to deal with the World War II tragedy. The category places Dan among Yugoslavs Vladimir Dedijer, Vladimir Nazor and Viktor Novak; Czechoslovaks Ján Bodenek, Jan Drda, Miloš Krno and Jozef Horák; Polish Kazimierz Brandys, Hungarian Ernő Szép and Bulgarian Iordan Velchev. This view is contrasted by poet and critic Boris Marian, who finds that the narrative, which displays \"impressive realism\" and \"alert style\", is not documentary, but rather personal; according to him, although briefly showing communists at work, \"Unde începe...\" goes against its time by not presenting them in an ideal light. According to Henri Zalis, Dan's account forms \"an ample novella\" about \"the inferno of a Nazi camp\".\n\nIn \"Roza și ceilalți\", the libertine daughter of a Jewish tailor is persuaded by her coreligionists into accepting the sexual advances of a Nazi German officer. Called a \"tragic buffoonery\" by George Călinescu (in an updated version of his 1941 overview), the narrative culminates with the German retreat, after which Roza, branded a collaborator, is tortured and raped by her own community.\n\nEssentially an anti-communist, Dan refused to comply with the requirements imposed on literature by the Socialist realist establishment during the late 1940s. However, giving in to political pressure after his return from jail, he produced \"Tase cel Mare\": called an \"accessible\" and \"simplistic\" novel by Zalis, it is thematically linked to the world depicted in \"Surorile Veniamin\".\n\nEssayist and literary historian Barbu Cioculescu recalled that Dan, \"an excellent writer and man of character\", was vilified in the 1940s by a \"wretched epigram\". The antisemitic rhyme went as follows:\nDuring the antisemitic censoring and deportation of Sergiu Dan, George Călinescu still defied the political restrictions. His work still included literary profiles of Dan and other Jewish Romanian writers. This gesture of goodwill was acknowledged by Dan. He spoke to Emil Dorian about the Antonescu regime's attempt to circulate an alternative, antisemitic, Romanian literature tract, overseen by Ion Petrovici. Călinescu's defiance was perceived as an outrage by Romania's fascist periodicals. The newspaper \"Porunca Vremii\" called for Călinescu to be punished for his attack on \"the cleanliness of the Romanian soul\". It asserted that Jewish writers, Dan included, had no part to play in Romanian culture. The same was stated in \"Gândirea\". It argued that, in reviewing Dan and the others, Călinescu had soiled the \"Romanian blood that was shed under the pointy claw of the Talmud\".\n\nAfter renewed communist censorship, Sergiu Dan's work was again given consideration in Communist Romania during the 1960s liberalization episode. However, researcher Radu Ioanid notes, his references to the Holocaust were uncomfortable subjects for the national communist apparatus. Ioanid speaks about \"selective censorship\" on Romanian Holocaust literature, with Dan being one of the few authors whose works on the topic remained publishable. Some other such exceptions are Camil Baltazar, Maria Banuș, Aurel Baranga, F. Brunea-Fox, Eusebiu Camilar, Georgeta Horodincă, Alexandru Ivasiuc, Norman Manea, Sașa Pană and Titus Popovici. A reprint of \"Unde începe noaptea\" was still not possible, even though Carandino, newly released from prison, pleaded on this issue with communist President Nicolae Ceaușescu.\n\nAfter the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Dan remained largely unknown to the Romanian public. Boris Marian wrote in 2006: \"more gifted, we believe, than any one of his better-known colleagues, [Sergiu Dan] is a name rarely mentioned nowadays.\" Henri Zalis took special care to republish and reevaluate the early work of Sergiu Dan and other Jewish Romanians, a conscious effort to reduce the impact of antisemitic or communist repression. According to fellow critic Ovidiu Morar, this reevaluation of the political aspect was groundbreaking, and \"worthy of appreciation\". Cultural journalist Iulia Deleanu also noted that, in his treatment of Dan and other persecuted Jewish writers of that generation, Zalis acted as a \"diagnostician\". Of Dan's contribution, Zalis noted: \"[it] must not be forgotten [since] it speaks of an experienced tragedy, one that is inseparable from the history of [his] century. A history that belongs to us, once it is no longer overlooked.\" During Bookfest 2006, Zalis and Editura Hasefer, the Jewish Romanian publishing house, released a critical edition of \"Unde începe noaptea\".\n\n"}
{"id": "55489052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55489052", "title": "Sources and parallels of the Exodus", "text": "Sources and parallels of the Exodus\n\nThe scholarly consensus is that there was no Exodus as described in the Bible. Modern archaeologists believe that the Israelites were indigenous to Canaan and were never in Egypt, and if there is any historical basis to the Exodus it can apply only to a small segment of the population of Israelites at large. Nevertheless, there is also a general understanding that something must lie behind the traditions, even if Moses and the Exodus narrative belong to collective cultural memory rather to history. Most scholars therefore agree that the narrative has a historical core, and that some highland settlers, numbering from a few hundred to a few thousand individuals, came from Egypt.\n\nEgyptologist Jan Assmann suggests that the Exodus narrative combines, among other things, the expulsion of the Hyksos, the religious revolution of Akhenaten, the experiences of the Habiru (gangs of antisocial elements found throughout the ancient Near East), and the large-scale migrations of the 'Sea Peoples', into \"a coherent story that is fictional as to its composition but historical as to some of its components.\"\n\nThe consensus of modern scholars is that the Bible does not give an accurate account of the origins of Israel.\nThere is no indication that the Israelites ever lived in Ancient Egypt, and the Sinai Peninsula shows almost no sign of any occupation for the entire 2nd millennium BCE (even Kadesh-Barnea, where the Israelites are said to have spent 38 years, was uninhabited prior to the establishment of the Israelite monarchy). In contrast to the absence of evidence for the Egyptian captivity and wilderness wanderings, there are ample signs of Israel's evolution within Canaan from native Canaanite roots. While a few scholars discuss the historicity, or at least plausibility, of the exodus story, the majority of archaeologists have abandoned it, in the phrase used by archaeologist William Dever, as \"a fruitless pursuit\".\n\nThe biblical narrative contains some details which are authentically Egyptian, but such details are scant, and the story frequently does not reflect Egypt of the Late Bronze Age or even Egypt at all (it is unlikely, for example, that a mother would place a baby in the reeds of the Nile, where it would be in danger from crocodiles). Such elements of the narrative as can be fitted into the 2nd millennium could equally belong to the 1st, consistent with a 1st millennium BCE writer trying to set an old story in Egypt. (The name of Moses, for example, belongs to 1st millennium Egyptian, and would have been \"Mase\" in the 2nd). As a result, while a few scholars continue to discuss the historicity, or at least plausibility, of an exodus as described in the Bible, most histories of Israel do not include the Egyptian captivity, the Exodus, or the wilderness wanderings in their discussion of Israel's origins.\n\nA century of research by archaeologists and Egyptologists has found no evidence which can be directly related to the Exodus captivity and the escape and travels through the wilderness. Archaeologists generally agree that the Israelites had Canaanite origins: the culture of the earliest Israelite settlements is Canaanite, their cult-objects are those of the Canaanite god El, the pottery remains are in the Canaanite tradition, and the alphabet used is early Canaanite. Almost the sole marker distinguishing the \"Israelite\" villages from Canaanite sites is an absence of pig bones, although whether even this is an ethnic marker or is due to other factors remains a matter of dispute.\n\nAccording to Exodus 12:37–38, the Israelites numbered \"about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children\", plus many non-Israelites and livestock. Numbers 1:46 gives a more precise total of 603,550 men aged 20 and up. It is difficult to reconcile the idea of 600,000 Israelite fighting men with the information that the Israelites were afraid of the Philistines and Egyptians. The 600,000, plus wives, children, the elderly, and the \"mixed multitude\" of non-Israelites would have numbered some 2 million people. Marching ten abreast, and without accounting for livestock, they would have formed a column 240 km long. The entire Egyptian population in 1250 BCE is estimated to have been around 3 to 3.5 million, and no evidence has been found that Egypt ever suffered the demographic and economic catastrophe such a loss of population would represent, nor that the Sinai desert ever hosted (or could have hosted) these millions of people and their herds. Some have rationalised the numbers into smaller figures, for example reading the Hebrew as \"600 families\" rather than 600,000 men, but all such solutions have their own set of problems.\n\nDetails point to a 1st millennium date for the composition of the narrative: Ezion-Geber (one of the Stations of the Exodus), for example, dates to a period between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE with possible further occupation into the 4th century BCE, and those place-names on the Exodus route which have been identified – Goshen, Pithom, Succoth, Ramesses and Kadesh Barnea – point to the geography of the 1st millennium rather than the 2nd. Similarly, Pharaoh's fear that the Israelites might ally themselves with foreign invaders seems unlikely in the context of the late 2nd millennium, when Canaan was part of an Egyptian empire and Egypt faced no enemies in that direction, but does make sense in a 1st millennium context, when Egypt was considerably weaker and faced invasion first from the Achaemenid Empire and later from the Seleucid Empire. The mention of the dromedary in Exodus 9:3 also suggests a later date – the widespread domestication of the camel as a herd animal is thought not to have taken place before the late 2nd millennium, after the Israelites had already emerged in Canaan, and they did not become widespread in Egypt until c. 200–100 BCE.\n\nThe chronology of the Exodus narrative is symbolic: for example, its culminating event, the erection of the Tabernacle as Yahweh's dwelling-place among his people, occurs in the year 2666 Anno Mundi (Year of the World, meaning 2666 years after God creates the world), and two-thirds of the way through a four thousand year era which culminates in or around the re-dedication of the Second Temple in 164 BCE. As a result, attempts to date the event to a specific century in known history have been inconclusive. places it 480 years before the construction of Solomon's Temple, implying an Exodus at c. 1450 BCE, but the number is rhetorical rather than historical, representing a symbolic twelve generations of forty years each. In any case, Canaan at this time was part of the Egyptian empire, so that the Israelites would in effect be escaping from Egypt to Egypt, and its cities do not show destruction layers consistent with the Bible's account of the occupation of the land (Jericho was \"small and poor, almost insignificant, and unfortified (and) [t]here was also no sign of a destruction\" (Finkelstein and Silberman, 2002). William F. Albright, the leading biblical archaeologist of the mid-20th century, proposed a date of around 1250–1200 BCE, but his so-called \"Israelite\" markers (four-roomed houses, collar-rimmed jars, etc,) are continuations of Canaanite culture. The lack of evidence has led scholars to conclude that the Exodus story does not represent a specific historical moment. \n\nThe Torah lists the places where the Israelites rested. A few of the names at the start of the itinerary, including Ra'amses, Pithom and Succoth, are reasonably well identified with archaeological sites on the eastern edge of the Nile Delta, as is Kadesh-Barnea, where the Israelites spend 38 years after turning back from Canaan; other than these, very little is certain. The crossing of the Red Sea has been variously placed at the Pelusic branch of the Nile, anywhere along the network of Bitter Lakes and smaller canals that formed a barrier toward eastward escape, the Gulf of Suez (south-southeast of Succoth), and the Gulf of Aqaba (south of Ezion-Geber), or even on a lagoon on the Mediterranean coast. The Biblical Mount Sinai is identified in Christian tradition with Jebel Musa in the south of the Sinai Peninsula, but this association dates only from the 3rd century CE, and no evidence of the Exodus has been found there.\n\nThe Hyksos were a Semitic people whose arrival and departure from Ancient Egypt has sometimes been seen as broadly parallel to the biblical tale of the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt. Canaanite populations first appeared in Egypt towards the end of the 12th Dynasty c. 1800 BCE, and either around that time, or c. 1720 BCE, established an independent realm in the eastern Nile Delta. In about 1650 BCE, this realm was assumed by the rulers known as the Hyksos, who formed the 15th Dynasty of Egyptian pharaohs.\n\nIt has been claimed that new revolutionary methods of warfare ensured for the Hyksos their ascendancy, in their influx into the new emporia being established in Egypt's delta and at Thebes in support of the Red Sea trade. However, in recent years the idea of a simple Hyksos migration, with little or no war, has gained support.\n\nIn any case, the 16th Dynasty and the 17th Dynasty continued to rule in Upper Egypt (southern Egypt) in co-existence with the Hyksos kings, perhaps as their vassals. Eventually, Seqenenre Tao, Kamose and Ahmose I waged war against the Hyksos and expelled Khamudi, their last king, from Egypt c. 1550 BCE.\n\nThe saga of the Hyksos was recorded by the Egyptian historian Manetho (3rd century BCE), chief priest at the Temple of Ra in Heliopolis, and is preserved in three quotations by the 1st century CE Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus. In Manetho's \"History of Egypt\", as retold by Josephus, Manetho describes the Hyksos, their lowly origins in Asia, their invasion and dominion over Egypt, their eventual expulsion, and their subsequent exile to Judea, and their establishing the city of Jerusalem and its temple. Manetho defined the Hyksos as being the Hyksos or \"Shepherd Kings\" or \"Captive Shepherds\" who invaded Egypt, destroying its cities and temples and making war with the Egyptian people to \"gradually destroy them to the very roots\". Following a war with the Egyptians a treaty was negotiated stipulating that these Hyksos Shepherds were to exit Egypt. \n\nJosephus said that Manetho's Hyksos narrative was a reliable Egyptian account about the Israelite Exodus, and that the Hyksos were 'our people'. Martin Bernal found that a direct relationship between the Hyksos and Israelites is plausible, although it cannot be proven. He noted that the name of the pharaoh Yaqub-Har is similar to the name of the Israelite patriarch Jacob, and that the highest density of Hyksos scarabs is found in the Israelite West Bank. Donald Redford said that the Exodus narrative is a Canaanite memory of the Hyksos' descent and occupation of Egypt. Jan Assmann said the biblical narrative is more like a counterhistory: \"It turns kings into slaves; an expulsion into a ban on emigration; a descent from the Egyptian throne to insignificance into an ascent from oppression to freedom as god's chosen people.\"\n\nMost modern historians reject any identification of the Hyksos with the Israelites, largely because it is generally believed that the early Israelites evolved within the land and culture of Canaan, rather than emerging from Egypt. There is a current scholarly consensus that if the Israelites did emerge from Egypt, it must have occurred sometime during the 13th century, because there is no archaeological evidence of any distinctive Israelite material culture before that time.\n\nIn her book \"The Parting of the Sea: How Volcanoes, Earthquakes, and Plagues Shaped the Story of the Exodus\", geologist Barbara J. Sivertsen explored links between the biblical Exodus narrative, the Hyksos expulsion, and the Minoan (Thera) volcanic eruption.\n\nApocalyptic rainstorms, which devastated much of Egypt, and were described on the Tempest Stele of Ahmose I, pharaoh of the Hyksos expulsion, have been attributed to short-term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption. In 2014, Nadine Moeller and Robert Ritner offered a new translation of the Tempest Stela. They believe the unusual weather patterns described on the slab were the result of a massive volcano explosion at Thera. They also suggest that the Egyptian pharaoh Ahmose I ruled at a time closer to the Thera eruption than previously thought.\n\nThe difficulty with this interpretation is that in the conventional but disputed Egyptian chronology Ahmose I ruled from c. 1549–1524 BCE, whilst the eruption is thought to have occurred somewhere between 1642–1540 BCE. Alternatively, if the eruption occurred in the Second Intermediate Period, the absence of Egyptian records of the eruption could be caused by the general disorder in Egypt around that time. \n\nWhile it has been argued that the damage attributed to this storm may have been caused by an earthquake following the Thera Eruption, it has also been suggested that it was caused during a war with the Hyksos, and the storm reference is merely a metaphor for chaos upon which the Pharaoh was attempting to impose order. Documents such as Hatshepsut's Speos Artemidos depict storms, but are clearly figurative not literal. Research indicates that the Speos Artemidos stele is a reference to her overcoming the powers of chaos and darkness.\n\nAkhenaten, also known as Amenhotep IV, was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty. This Pharaoh presided over radical changes in Egyptian religious practices. He established a form of solar monotheism or monolatry based on the cult of Aten, and disbanded the priesthoods of all other gods. His new capital, Akhetaten or 'Horizon of Aten', was built at the site known today as Amarna. The city was built hastily, mostly using mud bricks. After Akhenaten's death, it was abandoned. The temples, shrines, and royal statues were razed later, during the reign of Horemheb.\n\nThe idea of Akhenaten as the pioneer of a monotheistic religion that later became Judaism has been considered by various scholars. One of the first to mention this was Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, in his book \"Moses and Monotheism\".Basing his arguments on a belief that the Exodus story was historical, Freud argued that Moses had been an Atenist priest forced to leave Egypt with his followers after Akhenaten's death. Freud argued that Akhenaten was striving to promote monotheism, something that the biblical Moses was able to achieve.\n\nStephen Gabriel Rosenberg, an Israeli archaeologist, suggested that conditions in the Amarna period ending with the reign of Akhenaten's son, Tutankhamun, very closely match those described in Exodus:\n\nRosenberg further suggests that this date can be reconciled easily with Exodus 12:40 claiming 430 years in Egypt - since 1760 BCE - and the theory that the Israelites came to Egypt with the semitic Hyksos, as proposed by Josephus, which modern scholars place within decades of that time. An also, that if the Solomonic Temple was built 12 generations after the Exodus (I Kings 6:1) and these are actually 30 not 40 real years, 360 years after 1330 is 970 BCE, again within decades of modern estimates.\n\nIn 1973, William F. Albright noted that Moses and many of his family members had Egyptian names, and said that there is no good reason to deny that Moses was influenced by the monotheism of Akhenaten. However, Donald Redford said that there is little evidence that Akhenaten was a progenitor of Biblical monotheism. To the contrary, he said, the religion of the Hebrew Bible had its own separate development beginning 500 years later.\n\nSeveral ancient non-biblical sources seem to parallel the biblical Exodus narrative, and/or the events which occurred at the end of the eighteenth dynasty, when the new religion of Akhenaten was denounced and his capital city of Amarna was abandoned. These tales often combine elements of the Hyksos expulsion. For example, Hecataeus of Abdera (c. 320 BCE) tells how the Egyptians blamed a plague on foreigners and expelled them from the country, whereupon Moses, their leader, took them to Canaan. There are more than a dozen versions of this story, all of them adding more detail, most of them profoundly anti-Jewish. Manetho tells how 80,000 lepers and other \"impure people\", led by a priest named Osarseph, join forces with the former Hyksos, now living in Jerusalem, to take over Egypt. They wreak havoc until eventually the pharaoh and his son chase them out to the borders of Syria, where Osarseph gives the lepers a law-code and changes his name to Moses, although the identification of Osarseph with Moses in the second account may be a later addition. Josephus vehemently disagreed with the claim that the Israelites were connected with Manetho's story about Osarseph and the lepers. The stories told by Hecataeus and Manetho seems to be related in some way to that of the Exodus, although it is impossible to tell whether they both bear witness to historical events, or Manetho is a polemical response to the Exodus story, or the Exodus story a response to the Egyptian stories.\n\nThree interpretations have been proposed for Manetho's story of Osarseph and the lepers: the first, as a memory of the Amarna period; the second, as a memory of the Hyksos; and the third, as an anti-Jewish propaganda. Each explanation has evidence to support it: the name of the pharaoh, Amenophis, and the religious character of the conflict fit the Amarna reform of Egyptian religion; the name of Avaris and possibly the name Osarseph fit the Hyksos period; and the overall plot is an apparent inversion of the Jewish story of the Exodus casting the Jews in a bad light. No one theory, however, can explain all the elements. A proposal by Egyptologist Jan Assmann suggests that the story has no single origin but rather combines numerous historical experiences, notably the Amarna and Hyksos periods, into a folk memory.\n"}

The French publication was translated into English by Teresa Lavender Fagan. The foreword was written by Thomas Piketty, Zucman's PhD supervisor. Both Piketty and Zucman are critical of capitalism in its present form. Where Piketty's best-selling Capital in the Twenty-First Century was the catalyst for debate about inequality, Zucman targets individual and corporate tax havens. According to Zucman's research, $USD7.6 trillion representing about eight percent of global net financial wealth, is held in offshore accounts where no taxes are collected.\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times Book Review\" one of the \"strong\" virtues of \"The Hidden Wealth of Nations\", is that it sheds light on a potential area for significant reforms on an issues with which many may agree,\"You might believe that the tax system should be made more progressive, or you might believe that it should be made less so. But whatever you think, you are unlikely to support a situation in which trillions of dollars are hardly taxed at all.\" While \"The Atlantic\" described Zucman's \"The Hidden Wealth of Nations\" as \"carefully considered and closely argued\", there was criticism that his \"his optimism about initiatives\" like the much despised Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act\" (FATCA) and his \"neglect\" of certain \"conflicts of interest within nations.\" The review noted that Zucman was \"at the beginning of what promises to be a brilliant career\"−Zucman is a 28-year-old University of California, Berkeley economist. Tax havens essentially allow \"world’s wealthiest individuals and firms\" to \"steal revenue from other nations\". Those who avoid paying their fair share of taxes shift the burden to ordinary people. \"The Atlantic\" reviews said that Zucman’s \"main achievement\" was to quantify the theft: \"$200 billion in state revenues lost through private individuals' use of tax havens, plus another $130 billion in losses created by U.S. firms booking their profits offshore.\" \"Bloomberg Businessweek\" described it \"this year’s Piketty\", referring to Thomas Piketty, whose best-selling \"opus\" Capital in the Twenty-First Century, \"renewed a debate about inequality\" in 2014. Piketty, who was Zucman's PhD. supervisor, wrote the forward to \"Hidden Wealth.\" Zucman, like Piketty is criticizing capitalism and his target is tax havens that allow the wealthiest individuals and corporations to avoid paying taxes on $USD7.6 trillion which represents about \"8 percent of the world’s net financial wealth\".\n\nThe book includes a forward by Thomas Piketty, an introduction on how countries can respond to tax havens, a chapter on the history of tax havens from the early twentieth century until today, a description of the \"missing wealth\" that tax havens steal from national revenues, past errors, suggestions for a new approach and a chapter on multinational corporations that avoid taxes using tax havens.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51795", "title": "Underwater archaeology", "text": "Underwater archaeology\n\nUnderwater archaeology is archaeology practiced underwater. As with all other branches of archaeology, it evolved from its roots in pre-history and in the classical era to include sites from the historical and industrial eras. Its acceptance has been a relatively late development due to the difficulties of accessing and working underwater sites, and because the application of archaeology to underwater sites initially emerged from the skills and tools developed by shipwreck salvagers. As a result, underwater archaeology initially struggled to establish itself as bona fide archaeological research. The situation changed when universities began teaching the subject and when a theoretical and practical base for the sub-discipline was firmly established. Underwater archaeology now has a number of branches including, after it became broadly accepted in the late 1980s, maritime archaeology: the scientifically based study of past human life, behaviours and cultures and their activities in, on, around and (lately) under the sea, estuaries and rivers. This is most often effected using the physical remains found in, around or under salt or fresh water or buried beneath water-logged sediment. In recent years, the study of submerged WWII sites and of submerged aircraft in the form of underwater aviation archaeology have also emerged as bona fide activity.\n\nThough often mistaken as such, underwater archaeology is not restricted to the study of shipwrecks. Changes in sea level because of local seismic events such as the earthquakes that devastated Port Royal and Alexandria or more widespread climatic changes on a continental scale mean that some sites of human occupation that were once on dry land are now submerged. At the end of the last ice age, the North Sea was a great plain, and anthropological material, as well as the remains of animals such as mammoths, are sometimes recovered by trawlers. Also, because human societies have always made use of water, sometimes the remains of structures that these societies built underwater still exist (such as the foundations of crannogs, bridges and harbours) when traces on dry land have been lost. As a result, underwater archaeological sites cover a vast range including: submerged indigenous sites and places where people once lived or visited that have been subsequently covered by water due to rising sea levels; wells, cenotes, wrecks (shipwrecks; aircraft); the remains of structures created in water (such as crannogs, bridges or harbours); other port-related structures; refuse or debris sites where people disposed of their waste, garbage and other items, such as ships, aircraft, munitions and machinery, by dumping into the water.\n\nUnderwater archaeology is often complementary to archaeological research on terrestrial sites because the two are often linked by many and various elements including geographic, social, political, economic and other considerations. As a result, a study of an archaeological landscape can involve a multidisciplinary approach requiring the inclusion of many specialists from a variety of disciplines including prehistory, historical archaeology, maritime archaeology, and anthropology. There are many examples. One is the wreck of the VOC ship \"Zuytdorp\" lost in 1711 on the coast of Western Australia, where there remains considerable speculation that some of the crew survived and, after establishing themselves on shore, intermixed with indigenous tribes from the area. The archaeological signature at this site also now extends into the interaction between indigenous people and the European pastoralists who entered the area in the mid-19th century.\n\nThere are many reasons why underwater archaeology can make a significant contribution to our knowledge of the past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual shipwrecks can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the \"Titanic\") or circumstances of loss (\"Housatonic\" was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine). Shipwrecks such as \"Mary Rose\" can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving an assemblage of human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost.\n\nSometimes it is not the wrecking of the ship that is important, but the fact that we have access to the remains of it, especially where the vessel was of major importance and significance in the history of science and engineering (or warfare), due to being the first of its type of vessel. The development of submarines, for example, can be traced via underwater archaeological research, via the \"Hunley\", which was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (\"Hunley\" also had unique construction details not found in previous vessels and was one of the few historic warships ever raised intact); the \"Resurgam\" \"II\", the first powered submarine; and \"Holland 5\", which provides insight into the development of submarines in the British Navy.\n\nAll traces of human existence underwater which are one hundred years old or more are protected by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This convention aims at preventing the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information and looting. It helps states parties to protect their underwater cultural heritage with an international legal framework.\nOn the basis of the recommendations defined in the above-mentioned UNESCO Convention various European projects have been funded such as the CoMAS project\n\nfor in situ conservation planning of underwater archaeological artefacts.\n\nUnderwater sites are inevitably difficult to access, and more hazardous, compared with working on dry land. In order to access the site directly, diving equipment and diving skills are necessary. The depths that can be accessed by divers, and the length of time available at depths, are limited. For deep sites beyond the reach of divers, submarines or remote sensing equipment are needed.\n\nFor a marine site, while some form of working platform (typically a boat or ship) is often needed, shore-based activities are common. Notwithstanding, underwater archaeology is a field plagued by logistics problems. A working platform for underwater archeology needs to be equipped to provide for the delivery of air for example, recompression and medical facilities, or specialist remote sensing equipment, analysis of archaeological results, support for activities being undertaken in the water, storage of supplies, facilities for conservation for any items recovered from the water, as well as accommodation for workers. Equipment used for archaeological investigation, including water dredge and air lifts create additional hazards and logistics issues. Moreover, marine sites may be subject to strong tidal flows or poor weather which mean that the site is only accessible for a limited amount of time. Some marine creatures also pose a threat to diver safety.\n\nUnderwater sites are often dynamic, that is they are subject to movement by currents, surf, storm damage or tidal flows. Structures may be unexpectedly uncovered, or buried beneath sediments. Over time, exposed structures will be eroded, broken up and scattered. The dynamic nature of the environment may make in-situ conservation infeasible, especially as exposed organics, such as the wood of a shipwreck, are likely to be consumed by marine organisms such as piddocks. In addition, underwater sites can be chemically active, with the result that iron can be leached from metal structures to form concretions. The original metal will then be left in a fragile state. Artifacts recovered from underwater sites need special care.\n\nVisibility may be poor, because of sediments or algae in the water and lack of light penetration. This means that survey techniques that work well on land (such as triangulation), generally can not be used effectively under water.\n\nIn addition it can be difficult to allow access to the results of the archaeological research as underwater sites do not provide good outreach possibilities or access for the general public. Work has been done to bridge this difficulty through the use of the World Wide Web for webcasting projects. An example is the excavation of the \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" and the \"QAR DiveLive\" program, a live interactive virtual field trip to the wrecksite.\n\nAlthough specialised techniques and tools have been developed to address the challenges of working under water, the archaeological goals and process are essentially the same as in any other context. Investigating an underwater site however, is likely to take longer and be more costly than an equivalent terrestrial one.\n\nAn important aspect of project design is likely to be managing the logistics of operating from a boat and of managing diving operations. The depth of water over the site, and whether access is constrained by tides, currents and adverse weather conditions will create substantial constraints on the techniques that can feasibly be used and the amount of investigation that can be carried out for a given cost or in a set timescale. Many of the most carefully investigated sites, including the \"Mary Rose\" have relied substantially on avocational archaeologists working over a considerable period of time.\n\nAs with archaeology on land, some techniques are essentially manual, using simple equipment (generally relying on the efforts of one or more scuba divers), while others use advanced technology and more complex logistics (for example requiring a large support vessel, with equipment handling cranes, underwater communication and computer visualisation).\n\nKnowing the location of an archaeological site is fundamental to being able to study it. In the open sea there are no landmarks, so position fixing is generally achieved using GPS. Historically, sites within sight of the shore would have been located using transects. A site may also be located by visually surveying some form of marker (such as a buoy) from two known (mapped) points on land. The depth of water at a site can be determined from charts or by using the depth sounding sonar equipment that is standard equipment on ships. Such sonar can often be used to locate an upstanding structure, such as a shipwreck, once GPS has placed the research vessel in approximately the right location.\n\nThe type of survey required depends on the information that is needed to resolve archaeological questions, but most sites will need at least some form of topographical survey and a site plan showing the locations of artifacts and other archaeological material, where samples were taken and where different types of archaeological investigation were carried out. Environmental assessment of archaeological sites will also require that environmental conditions (water chemistry, dynamic properties) as well as the natural organisms present on the site are recorded. For shipwrecks, particularly post-industrial age shipwrecks, pollution threats from wreck material may need to be investigated and recorded.\n\nThe simplest approach to survey is to carry out three-dimensional surveying by divers using depth gauges and tape measurements. Research shows that such measurements are typically less accurate than similar surveys on land. Where it is not practical or safe for divers to physically visit a site, Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) enable observation and intervention with control by personnel located at the surface. The low technology approach of measuring using tape measures and depth gauges can be replaced with a more accurate and quicker high technology approach using acoustic positioning. ROV technology was used during the \"Mardi Gras\" Shipwreck Project. The \"Mardi Gras Shipwreck\" sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water.\n\nRemote sensing or Marine Geophysics is generally carried out using equipment towed from a vessel on the surface and therefore does not require any one, or any equipment to actually penetrate to the full depth of the site. Sensitive sonar, especially side-scan sonar or multi-beam sonar may be used to image an underwater site. Magnetometry can be used to locate metal remains such as metal shipwrecks, anchors and cannon. Sub-bottom profiling utilizes sonar to detect structures buried beneath sediment.\n\nA variety of techniques are available to divers to record findings underwater. Scale drawing is the basic tool of archaeology and can be undertaken underwater. Pencils will write underwater on permatrace, plastic dive slates, or matt laminated paper.\n\nPhotography and videography are the mainstays of recording, which has become much more convenient with the advent of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. Cameras, including video cameras can be provided with special underwater housings that enable them to be used for underwater videography. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single photomontage or photomosaic image of the whole site. 3D photogrammetry has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites.\n\nWhere intrusive underwater excavation is appropriate, silts and sediments can be removed from an area of investigation using a water dredge or airlift. When used correctly, these devices have an additional benefit in tending to improve the visibility in the immediate vicinity of the investigation. It is also important to note that for very deep sea excavation submarines are sometimes used to view sites. Underwater photography can also be conducted from these submarines which assists the recording process.\n\nA variety of archaeological sciences are used in underwater archaeology. Dendrochronology is an important technique especially for dating the timbers of wooden ships. It may also provide additional information, including the area where the timber was harvested (i.e. likely to be where the ship was built) and whether or not there are later repairs or reuse of salvaged materials. Because plant and animal material can be preserved underwater, archaeobotany and archaeozoology have roles in underwater archaeology. For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or inland water, identification of pollen samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence on the nature of the landscape. Information about metal artifacts can be obtained through X-ray of concretions. Geology can provide insight into how the site evolved, including changes in sea-level, erosion by rivers and deposition by rivers or in the sea.\n\nArtifacts recovered from underwater sites need stabilization to manage the process of removal of water and conservation. The artifact either needs to be dried carefully, or the water replaced with some inert medium (as in the case of The Mary Rose). Artifacts recovered from salt water, particularly metals and glass need be stabilized following absorption of salt or leaching of metals. In-situ conservation of underwater structures is possible, but consideration needs to be given to the dynamic nature of the site. Changes to the site during intrusive investigation or removal of artifacts may result in scouring which exposes the site to further deterioration.\n\nDiver trails also called wreck trails can be used to allow scuba-divers to visit and understand archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-diving One excellent example is the Florida Public Archaeology Network's (FPAN) \"Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail.\" The Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail features 12 shipwrecks including artificial reefs and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, Florida. Otherwise presentation will typically rely on publication (book or journal articles, web-sites and electronic media such as CD-ROM). Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The \"Mardi Gras\" Shipwreck Project integrated a one-hour HD documentary, short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live underwater video of the \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" Shipwreck Project was webcast to the Internet as a part of the \"QAR DiveLive\" educational program that reached thousands of children around the world. Created and co-produced by Nautilus Productions and Marine Grafics, this project enabled students to talk to scientists and learn about methods and technologies utilized by the underwater archaeology team.\nFurthermore, thanks to the adoption of modern technologies, such as Virtual and Augmented reality systems, it is now possible to develop immersive and interactive digital environments for the exploitation of the underwater archaeology.\nPublication is an essential part of the archaeological process and is particularly crucial for underwater archaeology, where sites are generally not accessible and it is often the case that sites are not preserved in-situ.\n\nThe specialist journals on maritime archaeology, which include the long established \"International Journal of Nautical Archaeology\", \"The Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology\" (AIMA) and the recently launched \"Journal of Maritime Archaeology\" publish articles about maritime archaeological research and underwater archaeology. However, research on underwater sites can also be published in mainstream archaeological journals, or thematic archaeological journals. Some institutions also make their unpublished reports, often called 'Grey Literature', accessible thereby allowing access to far more detail and a wider range of archaeological data than is otherwise the case with books and journals. An example is the works of the Department of Maritime Archaeology at the Western Australian Museum.\n\nThe public interest market is covered by a number of diving, shipwreck and underwater archaeology books, beginning with the works of Jacques Cousteau.\n\nThe techniques of underwater archaeology are also documented in published works, including a number of handbooks, and Muckelroy's classic work on Maritime Archaeology.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "191577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191577", "title": "Wellington boot", "text": "Wellington boot\n\nThe Wellington boot was originally a type of leather boot adapted from Hessian boots. They were worn and popularised by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. The \"Wellington\" boot became a staple of practical foot wear for the British aristocracy and middle class in the early 19th century. The name was subsequently given to waterproof boots made of rubber and they are no longer associated with a particular class. They are now commonly used for a range of agricultural and outdoors pursuits.\n\nWellington boots in contemporary usage are waterproof and are most often made from rubber or polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a halogenated polymer. They are usually worn when walking on wet or muddy ground, or to protect the wearer from heavy showers and puddles. They are generally just below knee-high although shorter boots are available. \nThe \"Wellington\" is a common and necessary safety or hygiene shoe in diverse industrial settings: for heavy industry with an integrated reinforced toe; protection from mud and grime in mines, from chemical spills in chemical plants and from water, dirt, and mud in horticultural and agricultural work; and serving the high standard of hygiene required in food processing plants, operating theatres, and dust-free clean rooms for electronics manufacture.\n\nThe Duke of Wellington instructed his shoemaker, Hoby of St. James's Street, London, to modify the 18th-century Hessian boot. The resulting new boot was fabricated in soft calfskin leather, had the trim removed and was cut to fit more closely around the leg. The heels were low cut, stacked around an inch (2.5 centimetres), and the boot stopped at mid-calf. It was suitably hard-wearing for riding, yet smart enough for informal evening wear. The boot was dubbed the \"Wellington\" and the name has stuck in English ever since. In the 1815 portrait by James Lonsdale, the Duke can be seen wearing the more formal Hessian style boots, which are tasselled.\n\nWellington's utilitarian new boots quickly caught on with patriotic British gentlemen eager to emulate their war hero. Considered fashionable and foppish in the best circles and worn by dandies, such as Beau Brummell, they remained the main fashion for men through the 1840s. In the 1850s they were more commonly made in the calf-high version, and in the 1860s they were both superseded by the ankle boot, except for riding. Wellington is one of the two British Prime Ministers to have given his name to an item of clothing, the other being Sir Anthony Eden (see Anthony Eden hat) whilst Sir Winston Churchill gave his name to a cigar, and William Gladstone (twice prime minister between 1868 and 1894) gave his to the Gladstone Bag, the classic doctor's portmanteau.\n\nWellington boots were at first made of leather. However, in 1852 Hiram Hutchinson met Charles Goodyear, who had just invented the sulfur vulcanisation process for natural rubber. While Goodyear decided to manufacture tyres, Hutchinson bought the patent to manufacture footwear and moved to France to establish \"À l'Aigle\" (\"to the Eagle\") in 1853, to honour his home country. Today the company is simply called Aigle. In a country where 95% of the population were working on fields with wooden clogs as they had been for generations, the introduction of the wholly waterproof, Wellington-type rubber boot became an instant success: farmers would be able to come back home with clean, dry feet.\n\nProduction of the Wellington boot was dramatically boosted with the advent of World War I and a requirement for footwear suitable for the conditions in Europe's flooded and muddy trenches. The North British Rubber Company (now Hunter Boot Ltd) was asked by the War Office to construct a boot suitable for such conditions. The mills ran day and night to produce immense quantities of these trench boots. In total, 1,185,036 pairs were made to meet the British Army's demands.\n\nIn World War II, Hunter Boot was again requested to supply vast quantities of Wellington and thigh boots. 80% of production was of war materials – from (rubber) ground sheets to life belts and gas masks. In the Netherlands, the British forces were working in flooded conditions which demanded Wellingtons and thigh boots in vast supplies.\n\nBy the end of the war in 1945, the Wellington had become popular among men, women and children for wet weather wear. The boot had developed to become far roomier with a thick sole and rounded toe. Also, with the rationing of that time, labourers began to use them for daily work.\n\nThe lower cost and ease of rubber \"Wellington\" boot manufacture, and being entirely waterproof, lent itself immediately to being the preferred protective material to leather in all forms of industry. Increased attention to occupational health and safety requirements led to the steel toe or steel-capped Wellington: a protective (commonly internal) toe-capping to protect the foot from crush and puncture injuries. Although traditionally made of steel, the reinforcement may be a composite or a plastic material such as thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU).\n\nSuch steel-toe Wellingtons are nearly indispensable in an enormous range of industry and are often mandatory wear to meet local occupational health and safety legislation or insurance requirements.\n\nGreen Wellington boots, introduced by Hunter Boot Ltd in 1955, gradually became a shorthand for \"country life\" in the UK. In 1980, sales of their boots skyrocketed after Lady Diana Spencer (future Princess Diana) was pictured wearing a pair on the Balmoral estate during her courtship with Prince Charles.\n\nThough most commonly called \"gum boots\" or \"gumbies\", an alternative name, \"Blucher Boot\", is occasionally used by some older Australians. Blücher was Wellington's colleague at the Battle of Waterloo and there is speculation that some early emigrants to Australia, remembering the battle, may have confused a different design the Blucher shoe developed by Blucher. The Australian poet Henry Lawson wrote a poem to a pair of Blucher Boots in 1890.\n\nUsually called rubber boots, but sometimes galoshes, rain boots, mucking boots, billy boots, or gum-boots, are popular in Canada and the United States, particularly in springtime when melting snows leave wet and muddy ground. Young people can be seen wearing them to school or university and taking them to summer camps.\n\nWhile green is popular in Britain, red-soled black rubber boots are often seen in the United States, in addition to Canadian styles. Rubber boots specifically made for cold weather, lined with warm insulating material, are especially popular practical footwear for Canadian winters. This same style of lined boot is also popular among those who work in or near the ocean as one can wade in and out of shallow, but cold, ocean water, while staying dry and warm.\nIn the US white mid-calf rubber boots are worn by workers on shrimp boats and construction workers pouring concrete.\n\nLeather boots similar to Wellington's original Hessian boots have been marketed in North America as \"Ranch Wellingtons\" or \"Western Wellingtons\". These boots have more rounded toes, lower heels, and less radically scalloped tops than typical \"cowboy boots\".\n\nIn New Zealand, Wellingtons are called \"gumboots\" \"wellies\" or \"Redbands\" (after a popular brand), and are considered essential foot wear for farmers. Gumboots are often referred to in New Zealand popular culture such as the rurally-based \"Footrot Flats\" comic strip. The farming town of Taihape in the North Island proclaims itself \"Gumboot capital of the World\" and has annual competitions and events such as Gumboot Day, where gumboots are thrown. Most gumboots are black, but those worn by abattoir workers, butchers, fishermen and by hospital operating theatre staff and surgeons are white, and children's sizes come in multiple colours.\n\nThe term \"gum boot\" in New Zealand is thought to derive from the 19th-century kauri-gum diggers, who wore this footwear, or perhaps because the boots were made from gum rubber. The term is often abbreviated to \"gummies\". New Zealand comedy character Fred Dagg paid tribute to this iconic footwear in his song \"Gumboots\" a modified version of Billy Connolly's \"If It Wisnae Fur Yer Wellies\".\n\nThe boots are very popular in Scandinavian countries, with conditions and climate similar to Canada. In fact, before its entry into the mobile phone business, rubber boots were among the best-known products of Nokia. The Finnish Defence Forces issues rubber boots to all soldiers for use in wet conditions and during the winter with felt liners.\n\nIn Russia rubber boots were first introduced in the 1920s. Immediately, they became extremely popular because of Russian weather conditions. During the rule of Joseph Stalin, 17 rubber-boot factories were built in different parts of the Soviet Union. Along with valenki in winter, rubber boots became \"the\" traditional footwear in springs and autumns.\n\nWhen Nikita Khrushchev came to power, the boot became charged politically in the context of the \"Battle for Modesty\" campaign, where rubber footwear was proclaimed as \"socialism style\" (thus fashionable), while leather, which was obviously more expensive, was derided as \"capitalism style\" (thus unfashionable). During the period 1961–1964 leather footwear disappeared from Soviet shops. When Leonid Brezhnev came to power in 1964, the usual leather footwear returned to shops, and rubber boots quickly lost their popularity, returning to their original role of utility footwear.\n\nNowadays, Wellington boots in Russia have the same role as in most countries.\n\nWellington boots are a commonly used form of waterproof footwear in the UK, and usually referred to as \"Wellies\".\nWellington boots are particularly popular for small children when they want to jump in puddles.\n\nIn South Africa, the sound of people dancing in gumboots has been incorporated into a form of semi-traditional popular music, sometimes known as \"gumboot music\" or \"gumboot zydeco\" in Africa, or Welly boot dance by people from Britain. The dance began as a form of communication in the late 19th century in the gold mines of South Africa. The miners were forbidden to speak with each other while they worked, and were stripped of the right to wear their tribal garments. They adopted a system of communication using their work attire and native tribal rhythms. The miner uniform included Wellington boots, hard hats, and chains; so the miners used the items of their work uniform to develop a form of communication, for safety, and simply as a form of entertainment. Songs or chants sometimes accompanied these gumboot dances, often with themes of longing or loneliness, and sometimes making fun of their bosses in the songs. The owners of the mines, impressed with this phenomenon, would allow the best gumboot dancers to form troupes and perform. The dances, the uniform, and the rhythms have lived on, from the gold mines in South Africa, in step dance, as well as many other forms of music and dance that use the body to create arrangements of rhythms. Traditional gumboot dances, as well as contemporary versions, can be seen throughout Africa and the United States, though in South Africa gumboot dancing has become something of a tourist attraction, rather than a celebration of liberation under oppression. The 1986 Paul Simon album \"Graceland\" contains the song \"Gumboots\". This song, like much of the album, was recorded in South Africa.\n\nIn 1974 Scottish comedian Billy Connolly adopted a comical ode to the boot called \"The Welly Boot Song\" as his theme tune, and it became one of his best-known songs. In 1976, satirist John Clarke's alter ego Fred Dagg reworked Connolly's song as \"If It Weren't for your Gumboots\", and created a hit. Wellies have also been used by the band, Gaelic Storm, in their fifth full album, \"Bring Yer Wellies\", and in the song \"Kelly's Wellies\" on the same album.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996, BBC1 created several series of William's Wish Wellingtons, about a boy named William whose magical red Wellington Boots could grant him wishes.\n\nDanish band Alphabeat's 2007 album \"Alphabeat\" contains a song called \"Rubber Boots/Mackintosh\".\n\nIn the song \"Springtime\", Spinal Tap tires of spring, and they want drizzle, sleet, and \"Wellies on my feet\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there is a light-hearted sport, known as wellie wanging, which involves throwing Wellington boots as far as possible.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "246372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246372", "title": "World War I in literature", "text": "World War I in literature\n\nLiterature in World War I is generally thought to include poems, novels and drama; diaries, letters, and memoirs are often included in this category as well. Although the canon continues to be challenged, the texts most frequently taught in schools and universities are lyrics by Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen; poems by Ivor Gurney, Edward Thomas, Charles Sorley, David Jones and Isaac Rosenberg are also widely anthologised. Many of the works during and about the war were written by men because of the war's intense demand on the young men of that generation; however, a number of women (especially in the British tradition) created literature about the war, often observing the effects of the war on soldiers, domestic spaces, and the homefront more generally.\n\nThe spread of education in Britain in the decades leading up to World War I meant that British soldiers and the British public of all classes were literate. Professional and amateur authors were prolific during and after the war and found a market for their works.\n\nLiterature was produced throughout the war - with women, as well as men, feeling the 'need to record their experiences' - but it was in the late 1920s and early 1930s that Britain had a boom in publication of war literature. The next boom period was in the 1960s, when there was renewed interest in World War I during the fiftieth anniversaries and after two decades focused on World War II.\n\nPublished poets wrote over two thousand poems about and during the war. However, only a small fraction still is known today, and several poets that were popular with contemporary readers are now obscure. An orthodox selection of poets and poems emerged during the 1960s, which often remains the standard in modern collections and distorts the impression of World War I poetry. This selection tends to emphasise the horror of war, suffering, tragedy and anger against those that wage war.\n\nIn the early weeks of the war, British poets responded with an outpouring of literary production. Rudyard Kipling's \"For all we have and are\" was syndicated extensively by newspapers in English speaking countries. Robert Bridges contributed a poem \"Wake Up, England!\" at the outbreak of war that he later wished suppressed., John Masefield, who later succeeded Bridges as poet laureate, wrote \"August, 1914\", a poem that was admired widely.\n\nWilfred Owen was killed in battle; but his poems created at the front did achieve popular attention after the war's end.e.g., Dulce Et Decorum Est, Insensibility, Anthem for Doomed Youth, Futility and Strange Meeting. In preparing for the publication of his collected poems, Owen tried to explain:\n\nThe poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae continues to be one of the more popular wartime poems in Canada, and has achieved a status where it is recognized as one of the country's most notable unofficial symbols.\n\nThe expressionist poet August Stramm wrote some of Germany's important poems about the war.\n\nFrom the war itself until the late 1970s, the genre of war poetry was almost exclusively reserved for male poets. This was based on an idea of an exclusive authenticity limited to the works of those who had fought and died in the war. It excluded other forms of experience in the war, such as mourning, nursing and the home front, which were more likely to be experienced by other demographics such as women. There were over 500 women writing and publishing poetry during World War I. Examples of poems by female poets include Teresa Hooley's \"A War Film\", Jessie Pope's \"War Girls\", and Mary H.J. Henderson's \"An Incident\". In addition to giving women greater access to work, the war also gave women greater artistic freedom and space to express their identities as artists.\n\nA common subject for fiction in the 1920s and 1930s was the effect of the war, including shell shock and the huge social changes caused by the war. From the latter half of the 20th century onwards, World War I continued to be a popular subject for fiction, mainly novels.\n\nAlfred Noyes is often portrayed by hostile critics as a militarist and jingoist despite being a pacifist in life. In 1913, when it seemed that war might yet be avoided, he published a long anti-war poem called \"The Wine Press\". During World War I, Noyes was debarred by defective eyesight from serving at the front. Instead, from 1916, he did his military service on attachment to the Foreign Office, where he worked with John Buchan on propaganda. This included work as a literary figure, writing morale-boosting short stories and exhortatory odes and lyrics recalling England's military past and asserting the morality of her cause. These works are forgotten today apart from two ghost stories, \"The \"Lusitania\" Waits\" and \"The Log of the Evening Star\", which are still occasionally reprinted in collections of tales of the uncanny.\n\n\"Im Westen nichts Neues\" (\"All Quiet on the Western Front\"), Erich Maria Remarque's best-selling book about World War I, was translated into 28 languages with world sales nearly reaching 4 million in 1930. and the award-winning film which was based on that work of fiction have had a greater influence in shaping public views of the war than the work of any historian. John Galsworthy's perspective was quite different in 1915 when he wrote\n\nRemarque's book was partly based on Henri Barbusse's 1916 novel \"Under Fire\". Barbusse was a French journalist who served as a stretcher-bearer on the front lines, and his book was very influential in its own right at the time. By the end of the war, it had sold almost 250,000 copies and read by servicemen of many nations.\n\nBritish novelist Mary Augusta Ward wrote generally pro-war novels, some at the request of United States President Theodore Roosevelt, which nevertheless raised questions about the war. These include \"England's Effort\" (1916), \"Towards the Goal\" (1917), \"Missing\" (1917), \"The War and Elizabeth\" (1917) and \"Fields of Victory\" (1919).\n\nSome pre-existing popular literary characters were placed by their authors in World War I-related adventures during or directly after the war. These include Tom Swift (\"Tom Swift and His Aerial Warship\" in 1915 and \"Tom Swift and His Air Scout\" in 1919), Sherlock Holmes (\"His Last Bow\", 1917) and Tarzan (\"Tarzan the Untamed\", 1920).\n\nA.P. Herbert was one of the first combatants to publish a novel about the war, \"The Secret Battle\" (1919). This was followed in subsequent years by others, including \"Through the Wheat\" (1923) by Thomas Alexander Boyd, the \"Spanish Farm Trilogy\"—\"Sixty-Four\" (1925), \"Ninety-Four\" (1925) and \"The Crime at Vanderlynden's\" (1926)—by Ralph Hale Mottram, \"Death of a Hero\" (1929) by Richard Aldington, \"The Middle Parts of Fortune\" (1929) by Frederic Manning, \"The Patriot's Progress\" (1930) by Henry Williamson, \"Generals Die in Bed\" by Charles Yale Harrison (1930) and \"Winged Victory\" (1934) by Victor Maslin Yeates.\n\n\"Parade's End\" by Ford Madox Ford was a highly acclaimed tetralogy of novels, published between 1924 and 1927, that covers the events of World War I and the years around it from the viewpoint of a government statistician who becomes an officer in the British Army during the war. The novels were based on Ford's own experience in the war after he had enlisted at age 41.\n\nWilla Cather wrote \"One of Ours\" in 1922, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for her novel that tells the story of Claude Wheeler, a Nebraska farmer who escapes a loveless marriage to fight in the War. Critics like H.L. Mencken and Sinclair Lewis panned the book, mostly because it romanticized war. Cather based Claude Wheeler on her cousin G.P. Cather, who was killed in 1918 at the Battle of Cantigny in France.\n\nMay Sinclair volunteered with the Munro Ambulance Corps in 1914 and published her account of the front in Belgium as \"A Journal of Impressions in Belgium\" (1915). She followed this with three novels about the war, \"Tasker Jevons\" (1916), \"The Tree of Heaven\" (1917) and \"The Romantic\" (1920). Journalist Evadne Price wrote a semi-biographical novel \"\" (1930) about ambulance drivers based on women she had interviewed.\n\nW. Somerset Maugham's \"\" (1928), a collection of short stories, was based on the author's experience with British Intelligence during the war. It was loosely adapted into the film \"Secret Agent\" (1936), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and a 1991 BBC TV series.\n\nBritish novelist W.F. Morris wrote two mystery novels set in the Great War- (1929) and \"Behind the Lines\" (1930). Morris served in the British army during the war.\n\n\"A Farewell to Arms\" is a novel by Ernest Hemingway set during the Italian campaign of World War I. The book, published in 1929, is a first-person account of American Frederic Henry, serving as a lieutenant (\"Tenente\") in the ambulance corps of the Italian Army. The novel is about a love affair between the expatriate American Henry and Catherine Barkley against the backdrop of World War I, cynical soldiers, fighting and the displacement of populations. The publication of \"A Farewell to Arms\" cemented Hemingway's stature as a modern American writer, became his first best-seller, and is described by biographer Michael Reynolds as \"the premier American war novel from that debacle World War I.\"\n\nThe popular literary characters Biggles and Bulldog Drummond were created by veterans of the war, W.E. Johns and H.C. McNeile respectively. Both characters served in the war and shared some their creators' history. The Bulldog Drummond books were popular among veterans after the war. Writers like Paul Fussell and Janet S.K. Watson have questioned '[w]hat role […] memory play[s] in historical reconstruction’ - arguing that retrospective accounts are often disillusioned.\n\nAlthough most famous for his popular \"Hornblower\" series of Napoleonic War adventure novels, C.S. Forester also wrote three novels set in the First World War. Of the three, only one- \"The General\" (1936) was set on the Western Front, the others \"The African Queen\" (1935), which was famously filmed in 1951, was set in German East Africa and \"Brown on Resolution\" (1929), was a naval adventure set in the Central Pacific. According to one source, Adolf Hitler admired the novel \"The General\" in the late 1930s and recommended it to his generals due to its depiction of the British military mindset.\n\nWriter William March, who fought with the U.S. Marines in France during World War I, wrote a novel \"Company K\" in 1933, loosely based on his own experiences. Another American writer Dalton Trumbo wrote a bitterly anti-war novel \"Johnny Got His Gun\" in 1938 which won a National Book Award the following year and was made into a film in 1971. New Zealander John A Lee, who fought as an infantryman in World War I and who lost an arm, produced a novel \"Citizen into Soldier\" (1937) inspired by his own experiences.\n\nNovels concerning World War I continued to appear in the latter half of the 20th century, albeit less frequently.\n\nThe novel \"Return to the Wood\" (1955) by James Lansdale Hodson depicted the court-martial of a British soldier accused of desertion, and the book was adapted as the play \"Hamp\" in 1964 by John Wilson and filmed as \"King and Country\" by Joseph Losey in the same year.\n\nThe novel \"Covenant with Death\" (1961) by John Harris portrays a Sheffield Pals Battalion on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and Christopher Hitchens later referred to it as a 'neglected masterpiece'. In the mid-1960s, there was a resurgence of fiction depicting the aerial campaigns of World War I, including \"The Blue Max\" (1964) by Jack D. Hunter, which became a major film in 1966 along with \"A Killing for the Hawks\" (1966) by Frederick E. Smith and \"In the Company of Eagles\" (1966) by Ernest K. Gann. \n\n\"How Young They Died\" (1968) by Stuart Cloete was possibly the last novel written by an actual veteran. Elleston Trevor had made his name in the 1950s through episonage and WW2-themed novels but he turned to World War I with his novel \"Bury Him Among Kings\" (1970). \n\nThe novel \"Goshawk Squadron\" (1971) by Derek Robinson depicts a British air-force unit in the closing months of World War I and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. \"Three Cheers for Me\" (1962) and its sequel \"That's Me in the Middle\" (1973) by Donald Jack, are narrated by fictional Canadian air ace Bart Bandy; both won the Leacock Medal. Canadian novelist Timothy Findley's novel of the conflict \"The Wars\" was published in 1977 and it received his country's top award for literature.\n\n\"War Horse\" (1982) by Michael Morpurgo is set in World War I and won the Whitbread Book Award for 1982. It has been adapted into a play and film. U.S. writer Mark Helprin's \"A Soldier of the Great War\" and French novelist Sebastien Japrisot's \"A Very Long Engagement\" both appeared in 1991. The novel \"Birdsong\" (1993) by Sebastian Faulks received much praise.\n\nOf similar acclaim is Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy; the third novel from the series \"The Ghost Road,\" received the most prestigious award in British fiction: The Booker Prize in 1995 (though the nomination implied the award was for the whole series. In 2014, during the centenary of the World War I, the Indian author Akhil Katyal published the poem 'Some letters of Indian soldiers at World War One' marking the contribution of more than a million Indian soldiers to the war.\n\nCaptain John Hay Beith's \"The First Hundred Thousand\", a best-selling account of life in the army, was published in 1915 and became one of the more popular books of the period. It was translated into French as \"Les Premiers Cent Mille\". Due to its popularity in the United States, which was neutral at the time, Beith was transferred to the British War Mission in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe memoirs of several famous aerial 'aces' were published during the war, including \"Winged Warfare\" (1918) by Canadian William Bishop, \"Flying Fury\" (1918) by English ace James McCudden and \"The Red Fighter Pilot\" (1917) by Manfred von Richthofen (the latter two men were killed in action after their books were written). \n\nAfter the war many participants published their memoirs and diaries. One of the first was \"Storm of Steel\" (1920) by German writer Ernst Junger, an account of his experiences as an officer on the Western Front (it was first published in English in 1930). The first memoirs of Allied combatants were published in 1922, not long after the armistice: \"A Tank Driver's Experiences\" by Arthur Jenkins and \"Disenchantment\" by Charles Edward Montague.
