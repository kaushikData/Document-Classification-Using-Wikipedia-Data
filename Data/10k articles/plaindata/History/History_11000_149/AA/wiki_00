Raboteau\n\nAlbert Jordy Raboteau (born 1943) is an African-American scholar of African and African-American religions. Since 1982 he has been affiliated with Princeton University, where he is Henry W. Putnam Professor of Religion.\n\nAlbert Raboteau was born into a Catholic family in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, three months after his father, Albert Jordy Raboteau (1899–1943), was killed there by a white man. The boy was named for his late father, who was of African and French Creole descent. His father was killed in an era of white supremacy and legal racial discrimination in the state: the man who killed his father claimed self-defense and was never prosecuted for the crime. \n\nHis widowed mother moved the family from Mississippi, where she was a teacher, to find a better place in the North for her children to grow up. She married again, to an African-American minister. They lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan for a period and in California. Raboteau's stepfather taught the boy Latin and Greek starting at the age of five years, and helped him to focus on church and education as he grew up. Raboteau attended Catholic parochial and high schools. At age 11 he traveled with other choir boys from St. Thomas Catholic Church of Ann Arbor to sing in an international choir festival at the Vatican. \n\nRaboteau was accepted into college at the age of sixteen. He earned his BA at Loyola University in Los Angeles, California in 1964 and an MA in English from the University of California, Berkeley. Raboteau married and started a family.\n\nRaboteau entered the Yale Graduate Program in Religious Studies, where he studied with American religious historian Sydney Ahlstrom and African-American historian John Blassingame, receiving his PhD in 1974. Raboteau's dissertation, later revised and published as the book \"Slave Religion: The \"Invisible Institution\" in the Antebellum South,\" was published just as the black studies movement was gaining steam in the 1970s. It was a time of revolutionary scholarship on American slavery: Blassingame's \"Slave Community\" (1972) and \"Slave Testimony\" (1977); Eugene Genovese's \"Roll, Jordan, Roll\" (1974), Olli Alho's \"The Religion of Slaves\" (1976), and Lawrence Levine's \"Black Culture and Black Consciousness\" (1977).\n\nIn 1982 Princeton University hired Raboteau, first as a visiting professor and then as full-time faculty. He is Henry W. Putnam Professor of Religion. His research and teaching focus on American Catholic history, African-American religions, and religion and immigration issues. He chaired the Department of Religion (1987–92) and also served as dean of the Graduate School (1992–93). He received the Lifetime Service Award (Journey Award) in both 2005 and 2006. In 2005, he also received the special Achievement Award (Journey Award). In 2013 Raboteau retired but continues to teach as a professor emeritus. He is studying \"the place of beauty in the history of Eastern and Western Christian Spirituality.\" \n\nIn the late 20th century, Raboteau converted to Eastern Orthodoxy at a time of personal crisis and divorce from his first wife. At the time of his conversion, he took the name \"Panteleimon\", meaning the \"all merciful.\" He serves as lay coordinator of Mother of God Joy of All Who Sorrow Orthodox Mission in Rocky Hill, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The architecture of Bangladesh has a long history and is rooted in Bangladesh's culture, religion and history. It has evolved over centuries and assimilated influences from social, religious and exotic communities. The architecture of Bangladesh bears a remarkable impact on the lifestyle, tradition and cultural life of Bangladeshi people. Bangladesh has many architectural relics and monuments dating back thousands of years.\n\nThe Pala Empire was an early Indian empire of Bengali Buddhist dynasty ruling from Bengal (which included present day Bangladesh) from the 8th to the 12th centuries. The Palas created a distinctive form of Bengali architecture and art known as the \"Pala School of Sculptural Art.\" The gigantic structures of Vikramashila Vihar, Odantpuri Vihar, and Jagaddal Vihar were masterpieces of the Palas. These mammoth structures were destroyed by the forces of the infamous Bakhtiar Khilji. The Somapura Mahavihara, a creation of Dharmapala, at Paharpur, Bangladesh, is the largest Buddhist Vihara in the Indian subcontinent, and has been described as a \"pleasure to the eyes of the world.\" UNESCO made it a World Heritage Site in 1985. The Pala architectural style was followed throughout south-eastern Asia and China, Japan, and Tibet. Bengal rightfully earned the name \"Mistress of the East\". Dr. Stella Kramrisch says: \"The art of Bihar and Bengal exercised a lasting influence on that of Nepal, Burma, Ceylon and Java.\" Dhiman and Vittpala were two celebrated Pala sculptors. About Somapura Mahavihara, Mr. J.C. French says with grief: \"For the research of the Pyramids of Egypt we spend millions of dollars every year. But had we spent only one percent of that money for the excavation of Somapura Mahavihara, who knows what extraordinary discoveries could have been made\".\n\nThe Sultanate of Bengal was an era of the Central Asian origin Muslim Nawab dynasty that ruled independently of the Mughal Empire from 1342 to 1576. Most of the Muslim architecture of the period is found in the historic Gaur region, today's Rajshahi division and Malda district in West Bengal. The architecture of the period is noted for the development of a uniquely local style influenced by Bengali architectural traditions. Sultanate architecture is exemplified in structures such as the Shat Gombuj Masjid, the Shona Masjid and the Kusumba Masjid.\n\nIn 1576, much of Bengal came under the control of the Mughal Empire. At the time, Dhaka emerged as Mughal military base. The development of townships and housing had resulted in a significant growth in population, as the town was proclaimed by Subahdar Islam Khan I as capital of Bengal Subah in 1608, during this time many mosques and forts had been built. Bara Katra was built between 1644 and 1646 CE to be the official residence of Mughal prince Shah Shuja, the second son of emperor Shah Jahan.\n\nIndian Mughal architecture in present-day Bangladesh reached its peak during the reign of Subedar\nShaista Khan, who encouraged the construction of modern townships and public works in Dhaka, leading to a massive urban and economic expansion. He was a patron of the arts and encouraged the construction of majestic monuments across the province, including mosques, mausoleums and palaces that represented the finest in Mughal architecture. Khan greatly expanded Lalbagh Fort (also Fort Aurangabad), Chowk Bazaar Mosque, Saat Masjid and Choto Katra. He also supervised the construction of the mausoleum for his daughter Bibi Pari.\n\nMuch of the terracotta temple architecture in Bangladesh dates to the late Islamic period and early British period during which wealthy Hindu zamindars commissioned these structures.\n\nThe origin of the bungalow has its roots in the historical Province of Bengal. The term \"baṅgalo\", meaning \"Bengali\" and used elliptically for a \"house in the Bengal style\". Such houses were traditionally small, only one storey and detached, and had a wide veranda were adapted by the British, who used them as houses for colonial administrators in summer retreats in the Himalayas and in compounds outside Indian cities.\nThe Bungalow style houses are still very popular in the rural Bengal. In the rural areas of Bangladesh, it is often called \"Bangla Ghar\" (Bengali Style House). The main construction material used in modern time is corrugated steel sheets. Previously they had been constructed from wood, bamboo and a kind of straw called \"Khar\". Khar was used in the roof of the Bungalow house and kept the house cold during hot summer days. Another roofing material for Bungalow houses has been red clay tiles.\n\nIn the British colonial age predominantly representative buildings of the Indo-European style developed, from a mixture of mainly Indian, European and Central Asian (Islamic) components. Amongst the more prominent works are Ahsan Manzil in Dhaka and Tajhat Palace in Rangpur City.\n\nIn modern context, Bangladeshi architecture has become more diversified comprising reflections of contemporary architectural attributes, aesthetic and technologically advanced aspects. Since the inception of Bangladesh, economical advancement has boosted the architecture from its traditional forms to contemporary context. With the growing urbanization and modernization, the architectural form is turning into modernity covering a wide range of its heritage and tradition. The architecture of Bangladesh can provide insight into the history and lives of the Bangladeshi people.\n\nFazlur Rahman Khan was a structural engineer and architect, who initiated structural systems that are fundamental to tall building design today. Regarded as the \"Einstein of structural engineering\", his \"tubular designs\" for high rises revolutionized tall building design. Most buildings over 40-storeys constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan's structural engineering principles. He is the designer of Willis Tower – the second tallest building in the United States (once tallest and tallest in the world for many years), John Hancock Centre, Hajj Terminal, etc. Fazlur Rahman's innovations not only make the buildings structurally stronger and more efficient, they significantly reduce the usage of materials (economically much more efficient) while simultaneously allow buildings to reach even greater heights. Tubular systems allow greater interior space and further enable buildings to take on various shapes, offering unprecedented freedom to architects. He also invented the sky lobby for high rises and helped in initiating the widespread usage of computers for structural engineering. Fazlur Rahman is the foremost structural engineer of the 20th century who left an unprecedented and lasting influence on the profession, both nationally and internationally. Fazlur Rahman, more than any other individual, ushered in a renaissance in skyscraper construction during the second half of the 20th century and made it possible for people to live and work in \"cities in the sky\". Khan created a legacy of innovations that is unparalleled and became an icon in both architecture and structural engineering.\n\n\n"}

It was worn by Athenian tragic actors, hunters, and soldiers in Ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman societies.\nThe word buskin, only recorded in English since 1503 meaning \"half boot\", is of unknown origin, perhaps from Old French \"brousequin\" (in modern French \"brodequin\") or directly from its Middle Dutch model \"brosekin\" \"small leather boot\". Figurative senses relating to tragedy are from the word being used (since 1570) to translate Greek kothornos () or Latin cothurnus, the high, thick-soled boot worn in Athenian tragedy; contrasted with sock (from Latin soccus), the low shoe worn by comedians.\n\nByzantine emperors were formally clad in purple buskins, embroidered in gold with double-headed eagles.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, buskins are ceremonial liturgical stockings (\"caligae\" in Latin) of silk, sometimes interwoven with gold threads and even heavily embroidered, formerly worn by the celebrant of a pontifical Mass. The buskins can be worn over the episcopal sandals, regular dress socks with regular dress shoes, or over the red papal shoes worn by the Pope.\n\nOriginally liturgical buskins were worn by all priests, until about the eighth century when they were reserved for the exclusive use of bishops as part of the pontificalia, i.e. episcopal \"regalia\", a privilege in modern times extended to some lesser prelates. In liturgical colour they correspond to the chasuble, but are never worn with black.\n"}
{"id": "212402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212402", "title": "Christian Lassen", "text": "Christian Lassen\n\nChristian Lassen (October 22, 1800 – May 8, 1876) was a Norwegian-born orientalist and professor of Old Indian language and literature at the University of Bonn.\n\nHe was born at Bergen, Norway. Having received a university education at Oslo, he went to Germany and continued his studies at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Bonn. In Bonn, Lassen acquired a sound knowledge of Sanskrit. He spent three years in Paris and London, engaged in copying and collating manuscripts, and collecting materials for future research, especially with reference to Hindu drama and philosophy. During this period he published, jointly with Eugène Burnouf, his first work, \"Essai sur le Pâli\" (Paris, 1826).\n\nOn his return to Bonn he studied Arabic, and took the degree of Ph.D., his dissertation discussing the Arabic notices of the geography of the Punjab (\"Commentario geographica historica de Pentapotamia Indica\", Bonn, 1827). Soon after he was admitted \"Privatdozent\", and in 1830 was appointed extraordinary and in 1840 ordinary professor of Old Indian language and literature. In spite of a tempting offer from Copenhagen, in 1841, Lassen remained faithful to the university of his adoption to the end of his life. He died at Bonn, having been affected with almost total blindness for many years. As early as 1864 he was allowed to give up lecturing.\n\nIn 1829-1831 he brought out, in conjunction with August Wilhelm von Schlegel, a critical annotated edition of the \"Hitopadeśa\". The appearance of this edition marks the starting-point of the critical study of Sanskrit literature. At the same time Lassen assisted von Schlegel in editing and translating the first two cantos of the epic \"Rāmāyana\" (1829-1838). In 1832 he brought out the text of the first act of Bhavabhuti's drama, \"Mālatīmādhava\", and a complete edition, with a Latin translation, of the \"Sānkhya-kārikā\". In 1837 followed his edition and translation of Jayadeva's charming lyrical drama, \"Gītagovinda\" and his \"Institutiones linguae Pracriticae\".\n\nHis \"Anthologia Sanscritica\", which came out the following year, contained several hitherto unpublished texts, and did much to stimulate the study of Sanskrit in German universities. In 1846 Lassen brought out an improved edition of Schlegel's text and translation of the \"Bhagavad Gita\".\n\nAs well as the study of Indian languages, he was a scientific pioneer in other fields of philological inquiry. In his \"Beiträge zur Deutung der Eugubinischen Tafeln\" (1833) he prepared the way for the correct interpretation of the Umbrian inscriptions; and the \"Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes\" (7 vols., 1837-1850), started and largely conducted by him, contains, among other valuable papers from his pen, grammatical sketches of the Beluchi and Brahui languages, and an essay on the Lycian inscriptions.\n\nSoon after the appearance of Burnouf's \"Commentaire sur le Yacna\" (1833), Lassen also directed his attention to the Zend language, and to Iranian studies generally; and in \"Die altpersischen Keilinschriften von Persepolis\" (1836) he first made known the true character of the Old Persian cuneiform inscriptions, thereby anticipating, by one month, Burnouf's \"Mémoire\" on the same subject, while Sir Henry Rawlinson's famous memoir on the Behistun Inscription, though drawn up in Persia, independently of contemporaneous European research, at about the same time, did not reach the Royal Asiatic Society until three years later.\n\nSubsequently, Lassen published, in the sixth volume of his journal (1845), a collection of all the Old Persian cuneiform inscriptions known up to that date. He also was the first scholar in Europe who took up, with signal success, the decipherment of the newly discovered Bactrian coins, which furnished him the materials for \"Zur Geschichte der griechischen und indoskythsschen Könige in Bakterien, Kabul, und Indien\" (1838).\n\nThe first successful attempts at deciphering Brahmi were made in 1836 by Christian Lassen, who used the bilingual Greek-Brahmi coins of Indo-Greek kings Agathocles and Pantaleon to correctly identify several Brahmi letters. The task was then completed by James Prinsep, who was able to identify the rest of the Brahmi characters, with the help of Major Cunningham.\n\nHe contemplated bringing out a critical edition of the \"Vendidad\"; but, after publishing the first five fargards (1852), he felt that his whole energies were required for the successful accomplishment of the great undertaking of his life—his \"Indische Altertumskunde\". In this work—completed in four volumes, published respectively in 1847 (2nd ed., 1867), 1849 (2nd ed., 1874), 1858 and 1861—which forms one of the greatest monuments of untiring industry and critical scholarship, everything that could be gathered from native and foreign sources, relative to the political, social and intellectual development of India. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1868.\n\n"}

It can be constructed in various ways: as a simple earth embankment, as a wood and earth structure or as a wall. Circular ramparts usually have a moat or ditch in front of them; the embankment can be enhanced with a wooden palisade. Often several concentric rings were built, which produced a more effective defensive position against attackers. The interior of such sites often shows evidence of buildings such as halls, barns and other secondary structures.\n\nCircular ramparts are found in north and western Europe, for example, in Denmark, Estonia, Sweden, Germany, Great Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands; in central Europe, in Austria and Switzerland; in southeastern Europe in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine; and also in the United States. They are often hidden in woods and discovered by aerial photography. Archaeological profiles through the defences and excavations of the interior enable analysis of the period the site was occupied, the pottery used and the type of food consumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42754473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42754473", "title": "Columbia Amusement Company", "text": "Columbia Amusement Company\n\nThe Columbia Amusement Company, also called the Columbia Wheel or the Eastern Burlesque Wheel, was an industry organization that arranged burlesque company bookings in American theaters between 1902 and 1927. The burlesque companies would travel in succession round a \"wheel\" of theaters, ensuring steady employment for performers and a steady supply of new shows for the participating theaters. For much of its history the Columbia Wheel advertised relatively \"clean\" variety shows featuring pretty girls. Eventually the wheel was forced out of business due to competition from cinemas and from the cruder stock burlesque companies.\n\nThe Theatrical Syndicate was formed in 1896 by the theatrical managers or booking agents Charles Frohman, Al Hayman, A. L. Erlanger, Marc Klaw, Samuel F. Nirdlinger and Frederick Zimmerman. \nThe syndicate soon dominated legitimate theater, deciding what would be shown and where.\nThe Vaudeville Managers Association was founded soon after, with similar goals, and the United Booking Office was founded to provide a single place where performers could seek engagements.\n\nIn 1897, the burlesque producers and theater managers incorporated the Traveling Variety Managers of America (TVMA)--with the purpose of bettering the business of traveling variety managers and for benevolent, literary and fraternal purposes. The directors were Thomas E. Miaco, Henry C. Jacobs and Thomas E. McCready. Among the incorporators were Gus Hill, Phil Sheridan, Frank D. Bryan, George W. Rice and Fred Irwin. The idea was that approved shows would progress from one theater to another in succession, round a \"wheel\".The vaudeville and burlesque producer Gus Hill claimed credit for the concept.The theaters would not have to compete for shows, and the burlesque companies would have guaranteed work. The TVMA soon split into two wheels, one in the west and the other in the east.\n\nSixteen managers and producers incorporated the Columbia Amusement Company on 12 July 1902.\nThey had left the TVMA to set up a more stable operation.\nThe lead was taken by Sam A. Scribner. Other principals were William S. Campbell, William S. Drew, Gus Hill, John Herbert Mack, Harry Morris, L. Lawrence Weber and A. H. Woodhill.\nThe circuit had headquarter in New York and included the larger cities east of the Missouri and north of the Ohio such as Philadelphia and Pittsburg. It included Montreal and Toronto in Canada, and Boston in the east.\nSince the theaters were in the east, the Columbia Wheel was also called the Eastern Wheel. \nAnother circuit was formed in the west, called the Empire Circuit or Western Wheel.\n\nThe Columbia organizers at first aimed to provide affordable shows that were acceptable to women and men.\nThey advertised \"clean\" or \"refined\" burlesque.\nThey included lines of chorus girls and slightly risqué comedians, but did not go so far as to give offense.\nThe Columbia Wheel's refined burlesque shows had multi-act vaudeville-style programs that included farces, comedians, skits and variety acts. In August 1905 Will Rogers signed up with Scribner for five one-week shows in Brooklyn, New York, Buffalo, Cleveland and Pittsburg.\n\nAlthough the wheel system made the industry more stable, the shows became standardized. New costumes and acts were expensive, and when performers became better known they often left for legitimate theater.\nPerformers who started in burlesque included Weber & Fields, Bert Lahr, W. C. Fields, Red Skelton, Sophie Tucker and Fanny Brice. All of them moved into musical comedy or vaudeville as soon as they could.\nBut the audiences still came to see the girls, and burlesque remained profitable.\nThe Star and Garter opened in Chicago in 1908, providing \"Clean Entertainment for Self-Respecting People\".\nOn 10 January 1910 the Columbia Amusement Company opened the Columbia Theatre, \"Home of Burlesque De Luxe\", at Broadway and 47th Street in Manhattan. The theater was designed by William H. McElfatrick and had a capacity of 1,385. The company owned and operated it.\nThe Columbia theater opening was well publicized and was attended by various dignitaries.\n\nThe Empire pushed the legal limits with its \"hot\" shows.\nThe Columbia often lowered its standards and competed directly with the Empire.\nIn 1913 the Eastern and Western wheels were consolidated into the Columbia Amusement Company, headed by Samuel Scribner and Isidore Herk. The combined operation put on fairly clean shows, as had the Eastern Wheel.\nThe Columbia Wheel now had two large burlesque circuits.\nAnother wheel started to compete with raunchier performances.\nIn May 1915 the company transferred its No. 2 circuit, which had forty theaters and thirty-four touring companies, to a new subsidiary corporation called the American Burlesque Association. Gus Hill was named president of the new entity.\nThe American Wheel offered rawer performances, with blue humor and suggestive dancing, and drove the competition out of business.\n\nIn 1921 Scribner insisted that shows in the Columbia circuit include their own orchestras so they resembled the more respectable vaudeville shows, and banned smoking in the theaters. He also tried to ban the comedians from using double entendres, but with less success.\nA 1922 report said \"the companies will come to town on the same day each week to offer what is declared to be comedies with music, musical shows with chorus girls or whatever may best describe clean, wholesome offerings that should not be confused with \"burlesque\" as it was presented when Dad was a young chap.\"\n\nThe Columbia Wheel avoided runways until its final years, although the subsidiary American Wheel offered cooch dancers performing on runways.\nIn 1922 the American Wheel was dissolved due to an argument between Scribner and Herk and replaced by the Mutual Wheel.\nHerk headed up the Mutual.\nPerformers for the Mutual Wheel became the first to expose their breasts.\nThe Mutual put on less elaborate shows with more tease, although it generally did not include stripping.\nThe Mutual grew fast, buying up Columbia theaters across the country.\n\nIn 1923 Columbia still had thirty-eight shows, and was still the largest burlesque operation in the country.\nHowever, receipts were declining.\nBy the mid-1920s cinemas were providing shows that combined film and live entertainment with ticket prices lower than any burlesque show.\nIn the 1925 season Scribner authorized the removal of tights, and tableaux of bare-breasted women. Columbia continued to lose customers to other types of entertainment and to more explicit stock burlesque theaters.\n\nColumbia and Mutual merged in 1927 to form the United Burlesque Association. Herk, President of the Mutual Wheel, became President of the new combination, with Scribner, formerly president of the Columbia Wheel, as the Chairman of the Board. The new organization comprised 44 theaters, and soon reverted to the name Mutual Burlesque Circuit.\n\nBy the 1927–28 season the combined circuit was struggling financially. This was the last season where cartoon theatricals were a significant part of the burlesque shows. In 1930–31 the combined wheel decided to revive clean burlesque. The experiment failed and the circuit closed.\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}
{"id": "54223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54223", "title": "Creator deity", "text": "Creator deity\n\nA creator deity or creator god (often called the Creator) is a deity or god responsible for the creation of the Earth, world, and universe in human mythology. In monotheism, the single God is often also the creator. A number of monolatristic traditions separate a secondary creator from a primary transcendent being, identified as a primary creator.\n\nZoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism and Atenism teach that creation is the origin of the universe by the action of God.\n\nInitiated by Pharaoh Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti around 1330 BCE, during New Kingdom period in ancient Egyptian history. They built an entirely new capital city (Akhetaten) for themselves and worshippers of their Sole Creator God on a wilderness. His father used to worship Aten alongside other gods of their polytheistic religion. Aten, for a longtime before his father's time, was revered as a god among the many gods and goddesses in Egypt. Atenism faded away after death of the pharaoh. Despite different views, Atenism is considered by some scholars to be one of the frontiers of monotheism in human history.\n\nThe creation narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the two first chapters of the Book of Genesis. (There are no chapter divisions in the original Hebrew text, see Chapters and verses of the Bible.) The first account (1:1 through 2:3) employs a repetitious structure of divine fiat and fulfillment, then the statement \"And there was evening and there was morning, the [\"x\"] day,\" for each of the six days of creation. In each of the first three days there is an act of division: day one divides the darkness from light, day two the \"waters above\" from the \"waters below\", and day three the sea from the land. In each of the next three days these divisions are populated: day four populates the darkness and light with sun, moon and stars; day five populates seas and skies with fish and fowl; and finally land-based creatures and mankind populate the land.\n\nThe two stories are complementary rather than overlapping, with the first (the Priestly story) concerned with the cosmic plan of creation, while the second (the Yahwist story) focuses on man as cultivator of his environment and as a moral agent. There are significant parallels between the two stories, but also significant differences: the second account, in contrast to the regimented seven-day scheme of Genesis 1, uses a simple flowing narrative style that proceeds from God's forming the first man through the Garden of Eden to the creation of the first woman and the institution of marriage; in contrast to the omnipotent God of Genesis 1, creating a god-like humanity, the God of Genesis 2 can fail as well as succeed; the humanity he creates is not god-like, but is punished for acts which would lead to their becoming god-like (Genesis 3:1-24); and the order and method of creation itself differs. \"Together, this combination of parallel character and contrasting profile point to the different origin of materials in Genesis 1:1 and Gen 2:4, however elegantly they have now been combined.\"\n\nAncient Near Eastern mythologies and classical creation myths in Greek mythology envisioned the creation of the world as resulting from the actions of a god or gods upon already-existing primeval matter, known as \"chaos\".\n\nAn early conflation of Greek philosophy with the narratives in the Hebrew Bible came from Philo of Alexandria (d. AD 50), writing in the context of Hellenistic Judaism. Philo equated the Hebrew creator-deity Yahweh with Aristotle's \"primum movens\" (First Cause) in an attempt to prove that the Jews had held monotheistic views even before the Greeks. However, this was still within the context of creation from pre-existing materials (i.e. \"moving\" or \"changing\" a material substratum.)\n\nA similar theoretical proposition was demonstrated by Saint Thomas Aquinas, Doctor of the Church and founder of the Thomism that linked the Aristotelian philosophy with the Christian faith, followed by the statement for which God is the First Being, the Fist Moving unmoved, and is Pure Act.\n\nLooking at the Bible, the Second Book of Maccabees shows two relevant passages. At chapter 7, it narrows about the mother of a Jewish proto-martyr telling to her son: \"I beseech thee, my son, look upon heaven and earth, and all that is in them: and consider that God made them out of nothing, and mankind also\"; at chapter 1, it refers a solemn prayer hymned by Jonathan, Nehemiah and the Priest of Israel, while making sacrifices in honour of God: \"O Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, who art fearefull, and strong, and righteous, and mercifull, and the onely, and gracious king\".\nThe begins with: \"In the beginning was the Word, & the Word was with God, and the Word was God. / 2 The same was in the beginning with God. / 3 All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.\".\n\nChristianity affirms the Creation by God since its early time in the Apostles'Creed (\"I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.\", 1st century BC), that is symmetrical to the Nicene Creed (4th century BC). Traditionally the Latin expression \"Factórem cæli et terræ\" is read as the Creation \"ab initio temporis\" and \"ex nihilo\".\n\nNowadays, theologians debate whether the Bible itself teaches if this creation by God is a creation \"ex nihilo\". Traditional interpreters\nargue on grammatical and syntactical grounds that this is the meaning of Genesis 1:1, which is commonly rendered: \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\" They further find support for this view in New Testament passages like Hebrews 11:3—\"By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible\"—and Revelation 4:11—\"For you [God] created all things, and by your will they existed and were created.\" However, other interpreters\nunderstand creation \"ex nihilo\" as a 2nd-century theological development. According to this view, church fathers opposed notions appearing in \"pre\"-Christian creation myths and in Gnosticism—notions of creation by a demiurge out of a primordial state of matter (known in religious studies as \"chaos\" after the Greek term used by Hesiod in his \"Theogony\").\nJewish thinkers took up the idea, which became important to Judaism.\n\nAccording to Islam, God, known in Arabic as Allah, is the all-powerful and all-knowing Creator, Sustainer, Ordainer, and Judge of the universe. Islam puts a heavy emphasis on the conceptualization of God as strictly singular (tawhid). God is unique (\"wahid\") and inherently one (\"ahad\"), all-merciful and omnipotent. According to tradition there are 99 Names of God (al-asma al-husna lit. meaning: \"The best names\") each of which evoke a distinct attribute of God. All these names refer to Allah, the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name. Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are \"the Compassionate\" (\"al-rahman\") and \"the Merciful\" (\"al-rahim\").\n\nCreation is seen as an act of divine choice and mercy, one with a grand purpose: \"And We (Royal we) did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play.\" Rather, the purpose of humanity is to be tested: \"Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving;\" Those who pass the test are rewarded with Paradise: \"Verily for the Righteous there will be a fulfilment of (the heart's) desires;\"\n\nAccording to the Islamic teachings, God exists above the heavens and the creation itself. The Qur'an mentions, \"He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He Istawa (rose over) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything.\" At the same time, God is unlike anything in creation: \"There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.\" and nobody can perceive God in totality: \"Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted.\" God in Islam is not only majestic and sovereign, but also a personal God: \"And indeed We have created man, and We know what his ownself whispers to him. And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein (by Our Knowledge).\" Allah commands the believers to constantly remember Him (\"O you who have believed, remember Allah with much remembrance\") and to invoke Him alone (\"And whoever invokes besides Allah another deity for which he has no proof - then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed.\").\n\nIslam teaches that God as referenced in the Qur'an is the only god and the same God worshipped by members of other Abrahamic religions such as Christianity and Judaism.\n\nOne of the biggest responsibilities in the faith of Sikhism is to worship God as \"The Creator\", termed \"Waheguru\" who is shapeless, timeless, and sightless, i.e., Nirankar, Akal, and Alakh Niranjan. The religion only takes after the belief in \"One God for All\" or Ik Onkar.\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith God is the imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence. He is described as \"a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty\". Although transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation. The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator.\n\nMonolatristic traditions would separate a secondary creator from the primary transcendent being, identified as a primary creator. According to Gaudiya Vaishnavas, Brahma is the secondary creator and not the supreme. Vishnu is the primary creator. According to Vaishnava belief Vishnu creates the basic universal shell and provides all the raw materials and also places the living entities within the material world, fulfilling their own independent will. Brahma works with the materials provided by Vishnu to actually create what are believed to be planets in Puranic terminology, and he supervises the population of them.\n\nMonism is the philosophy that asserts oneness as its fundamental premise, and it contradicts the dualism-based theistic premise that there is a creator God that is eternal and separate from the rest of existence. There are two types of monism, namely spiritual monism which holds that all spiritual reality is one, and material monism which holds that everything including all material reality is one and the same thing.\n\nBuddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator.\n\nJainism does not support belief in a creator deity. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents - soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed (a static universe similar to that of Epicureanism and steady state cosmological model). All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of conservation of mass). Similarly, the soul of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.\n\nThe Jain theory of causation holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and therefore a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires, achieves liberation. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the cosmos; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.\n\nThrough the ages, Jain philosophers have adamantly rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as \"nāstika darsana\" or atheist philosophy by the rival religious philosophies. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its cosmology, karma, moksa and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.\n\nIn polytheistic creation, the world often comes into being organically, e.g. sprouting from a primal seed, sexually, by miraculous birth (sometimes by parthenogenesis), by hieros gamos, violently, by the slaying of a primeval monster, or artificially, by a divine demiurge or \"craftsman\". Sometimes, a god is involved, wittingly or unwittingly, in bringing about creation. Examples include:\n\n\nPlato, in his dialogue \"Timaeus\", describes a creation myth involving a being called the demiurge ( \"craftsman\"). Neoplatonism and Gnosticism continued and developed this concept. In Neoplatonism, the demiurge represents the second cause or dyad, after the monad. In Gnostic dualism, the demiurge is an imperfect spirit and possibly an evil being, transcended by divine Fullness (Pleroma). Unlike the Abrahamic God, Plato's demiurge is unable to create ex-nihilo.\n\nHinduism is a diverse system of thought with beliefs spanning monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, pandeism, monism, and atheism among others; and its concept of creator deity is complex and depends upon each individual and the tradition and philosophy followed. Hinduism is sometimes referred to as henotheistic (i.e., involving devotion to a single god while accepting the existence of others), but any such term is an overgeneralization.\n\nThe \"Nasadiya Sukta\" (\"Creation Hymn\") of the \"Rig Veda\" is one of the earliest texts which \"demonstrates a sense of metaphysical speculation\" about what created the universe, the concept of god(s) and The One, and whether even The One knows how the universe came into being. The \"Rig Veda\" praises various deities, none superior nor inferior, in a henotheistic manner. The hymns repeatedly refer to One Truth and Reality. The \"One Truth\" of Vedic literature, in modern era scholarship, has been interpreted as monotheism, monism, as well as a deified Hidden Principles behind the great happenings and processes of nature.\n\nThe post-Vedic texts of Hinduism offer multiple theories of cosmogony, many involving Brahma. These include \"Sarga\" (primary creation of universe) and \"Visarga\" (secondary creation), ideas related to the Indian thought that there are two levels of reality, one primary that is unchanging (metaphysical) and other secondary that is always changing (empirical), and that all observed reality of the latter is in an endless repeating cycle of existence, that cosmos and life we experience is continually created, evolved, dissolved and then re-created. The primary creator is extensively discussed in Vedic cosmogonies with \"Brahman\" or \"Purusha\" or \"Devi\" among the terms used for the primary creator, while the Vedic and post-Vedic texts name different gods and goddesses as secondary creators (often Brahma in post-Vedic texts), and in some cases a different god or goddess is the secondary creator at the start of each cosmic cycle (\"kalpa\", aeon).\n\nBrahma is a \"secondary creator\" as described in the \"Mahabharata\" and Puranas, and among the most studied and described. Born from a lotus emerging from the navel of Vishnu, Brahma creates all the forms in the universe, but not the primordial universe itself. In contrast, the Shiva-focussed Puranas describe Brahma and Vishnu to have been created by Ardhanarishvara, that is half Shiva and half Parvati; or alternatively, Brahma was born from Rudra, or Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma creating each other cyclically in different aeons (kalpa). Thus in most Puranic texts, Brahma's creative activity depends on the presence and power of a higher god.\n\nIn other versions of creation, the creator deity is the one who is equivalent to the Brahman, the metaphysical reality in Hinduism. In Vaishnavism, Vishnu creates Brahma and orders him to order the rest of universe. In Shaivism, Shiva may be treated as the creator. In Shaktism, the Great Goddess creates the Trimurti.\n\nPangu can be interpreted as another creator deity. In the beginning there was nothing in the universe except a formless chaos. However this chaos began to coalesce into a cosmic egg for eighteen thousand years. Within it, the perfectly opposed principles of yin and yang became balanced and Pangu emerged (or woke up) from the egg. Pangu is usually depicted as a primitive, hairy giant with horns on his head (like the Greek Pan) and clad in furs. Pangu set about the task of creating the world: he separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the Earth (murky \"Yin\") and the Sky (clear \"Yang\"). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. This task took eighteen thousand years, with each day the sky grew ten feet higher, the Earth ten feet wider, and Pangu ten feet taller. In some versions of the story, Pangu is aided in this task by the four most prominent beasts, namely the Turtle, the Qilin, the Phoenix, and the Dragon.\n\nAfter eighteen thousand years had elapsed, Pangu was laid to rest. His breath became the wind; his voice the thunder; left eye the sun and right eye the moon; his body became the mountains and extremes of the world; his blood formed rivers; his muscles the fertile lands; his facial hair the stars and milky way; his fur the bushes and forests; his bones the valuable minerals; his bone marrows sacred diamonds; his sweat fell as rain; and the fleas on his fur carried by the wind became human beings all over the world.\n\nThe first writer to record the myth of Pangu was Xu Zheng during the Three Kingdoms period.\n\nShangdi is another creator deity, possibly prior to Pangu; sharing concepts similar to Abrahamic faiths.\n\nAccording to Kazakh folk tales, Jasagnan is the creator of the world.\n\n"}

This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological NGOs, cults and mafias. One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker David Held. In the last decade he published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of global governance that encapsulates the entire world. For some, democratic mundialisation is a variant of democratic globalisation stressing the need for the direct election of world leaders and members of global institutions by citizens worldwide; for others, it is just another name for democratic globalisation.\n\nThese proponents state that democratic globalisation's purpose is to:\n\nSupporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the 'anti-globalization' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters. Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions.\nSome proponents in the \"anti-globalization movement\" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, George Monbiot, normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term Global Justice Movement) in his work \"Age of Consent\" has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies, and suggests a form of \"world government.\"\n\nDemocratic globalization supports the extension of political democratization to economic and financial globalization. It is based upon an idea that free international transactions benefit the global society as a whole. They believe in financially\nopen economies, where the government and central bank must be transparent in order to retain the confidence of the markets, since transparency spells doom for autocratic regimes. They promote democracy that makes leaders more accountable to the citizenry through the removal of restrictions on such transactions.\n\nThe democratic globalization movement started to get public attention when New York Times reported its demonstration to contest a World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle, Washington, November 1999. This gathering was to criticize unfair trade and undemocratic globalization of the WTO, World Bank, World Economic Forum (WEF), the International Monetary Fund. Its primary tactics were public rallies, street theater and civil disobedience.\n\nDemocratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by world citizens. The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.\n\nThus, it supports the International Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, direct election of United Nations (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide.\n\nSome supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the 'anti-globalization' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters although, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two camps. Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions and direct vote for world presidents (see presidentialism).\n\nSome supporters of the \"anti-globalization movement\" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, George Monbiot, normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term Global Justice Movement) in his work \"Age of Consent\" has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies by citizens, and suggests a form of \"federal world government\".\n\nDemocratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by voting by the citizens. The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.\n\nThey propose the creation of world services for citizens, like world civil protection and prevention (from natural hazards) services.\n\nThe concept of democratic globalization has supporters from all fields. Many of the campaigns and initiatives for global democracy, such as the UNPA campaign, list quotes by and names of their supporters on their websites.\n\nSome of the most prolific proponents are the British political thinker David Held and the Italian political theorist Daniele Archibugi. In the last decade they published several books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of global governance that encapsulates the entire planet. Richard Falk has developed the idea from an international law perspective, Ulrich Beck from a sociological approach and Jürgen Habermas has elaborate the normative principles.\n\n\nJim Stark has initiated a process for a Democratic World Parliament through a Global Referendum. As of August 20, 2013, 22,126 people have voted. So far, the votes are 95.3% in favor of creating a democratic world parliament. Portable voting booths are available at http://voteworldparliament.org/shadowbox/getballot.html. Online voting at Mr. Stark's website is at voteworldparliament.org.

{"id": "40010153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40010153", "title": "Goa", "text": "Goa\n\nGoa () is a state on the western coast of India, within the region known as the Konkan. It is bounded by Maharashtra to the north and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea forming its western coast. It is India's smallest state by area and the fourth-smallest by population. Goa has the highest GDP per capita among all Indian states, two and a half times that of the country. It was ranked the best-placed state by the Eleventh Finance Commission for its infrastructure and ranked on top for the best quality of life in India by the National Commission on Population based on the 12 Indicators.\n\nPanaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is its largest city. The historic city of Margao still exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first landed in the early 16th century as merchants and conquered it soon thereafter. Goa is a former Portuguese province; the Portuguese overseas territory of Portuguese India existed for about 450 years until it was annexed by India in 1961.\n\nGoa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year for its white sand beaches, nightlife, places of worship and World Heritage-listed architecture. It has rich flora and fauna, owing to its location on the Western Ghats range, a biodiversity hotspot.\n\nIn ancient literature, Goa was known by many names, such as \"Gomanchala\", \"Gopakapattana\", \"Gopakapattam\", \"Gopakapuri\", \"Govapuri\", \"Govem\", and \"Gomantak\". Other historical names for Goa are \"Sindapur\", \"Sandabur\", and \"Mahassapatam\".\n\nRock art engravings found in Goa exhibit the earliest traces of human life in India. Goa, situated within the Shimoga-Goa Greenstone Belt in the Western Ghats (an area composed of metavolcanics, iron formations and ferruginous quartzite), yields evidence for Acheulean occupation. Rock art engravings (petroglyphs) are present on laterite platforms and granite boulders in Usgalimal near the west flowing Kushavati river and in Kajur. In Kajur, the rock engravings of animals, tectiforms and other designs in granite have been associated with what is considered to be a megalithic stone circle with a round granite stone in the centre. Petroglyphs, cones, stone-axe, and choppers dating to 10,000 years ago have been found in various locations in Goa, including Kazur, Mauxim, and the Mandovi-Zuari basin. Evidence of Palaeolithic life is visible at Dabolim, Adkon, Shigao, Fatorpa, Arli, Maulinguinim, Diwar, Sanguem, Pilerne, and Aquem-Margaon. Difficulty in carbon dating the laterite rock compounds poses a problem for determining the exact time period.\n\nEarly Goan society underwent radical change when Indo-Aryan and Dravidian migrants amalgamated with the aboriginal locals, forming the base of early Goan culture.\n\nIn the 3rd century BC, Goa was part of the Maurya Empire, ruled by the Buddhist emperor, Ashoka of Magadha. Buddhist monks laid the foundation of Buddhism in Goa. Between the 2nd century BC and the 6th century AD, Goa was ruled by the Bhojas of Goa. Chutus of Karwar also ruled some parts as feudatories of the Satavahanas of Kolhapur (2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD), Western Kshatrapas (around 150 AD), the Abhiras of Western Maharashtra, Bhojas of the Yadav clans of Gujarat, and the Konkan Mauryas as feudatories of the Kalachuris. The rule later passed to the Chalukyas of Badami, who controlled it between 578 and 753, and later the Rashtrakutas of Malkhed from 753 to 963. From 765 to 1015, the Southern Silharas of Konkan ruled Goa as the feudatories of the Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas. Over the next few centuries, Goa was successively ruled by the Kadambas as the feudatories of the Chalukyas of Kalyani. They patronised Jainism in Goa.\n\nIn 1312, Goa came under the governance of the Delhi Sultanate. The kingdom's grip on the region was weak, and by 1370 it was forced to surrender it to Harihara I of the Vijayanagara empire. The Vijayanagara monarchs held on to the territory until 1469, when it was appropriated by the Bahmani sultans of Gulbarga. After that dynasty crumbled, the area fell into the hands of the Adil Shahis of Bijapur, who established as their auxiliary capital the city known under the Portuguese as Velha Goa (or Old Goa).\nIn 1510, the Portuguese defeated the ruling Bijapur sultan Yusuf Adil Shah with the help of a local ally, Timayya. They set up a permanent settlement in Velha Goa. This was the beginning of Portuguese rule in Goa that would last for four and a half centuries, until its annexation in 1961. The Goa Inquisition, a formal tribunal, was established in 1560, and was finally abolished in 1812.\n\nIn 1843 the Portuguese moved the capital to Panaji from Velha Goa. By the mid-18th century, Portuguese Goa had expanded to most of the present-day state limits. Simultaneously the Portuguese lost other possessions in India until their borders stabilised and formed the Estado da Índia Portuguesa or \"State of Portuguese India\", of which Goa was the largest territory.\n\nAfter India gained independence from the British in 1947, India requested that Portuguese territories on the Indian subcontinent be ceded to India. Portugal refused to negotiate on the sovereignty of its Indian enclaves. On 19 December 1961, the Indian Army invaded with Operation Vijay resulting in the annexation of Goa, and of Daman and Diu islands into the Indian union. Goa, along with Daman and Diu, was organised as a centrally administered union territory of India. On 30 May 1987, the union territory was split, and Goa was made India's twenty-fifth state, with Daman and Diu remaining a union territory.\n\nGoa encompasses an area of . It lies between the latitudes 14°53′54″ N and 15°40′00″ N and longitudes 73°40′33″ E and 74°20′13″ E.\n\nGoa is a part of the coastal country known as the Konkan, which is an escarpment rising up to the Western Ghats range of mountains, which separate it from the Deccan Plateau. The highest point is the Sonsogor, with an altitude of . Goa has a coastline of .\n\nGoa's seven major rivers are the Zuari, Mandovi, Terekhol, Chapora, Galgibag, Kumbarjua canal, Talpona and the Sal. The Zuari and the Mandovi are the most important rivers, interspaced by the Kumbarjua canal, forming a major estuarine complex. These rivers are fed by the Southwest monsoon rain and their basin covers 69% of the state's geographical area. These rivers are some of the busiest in India. Goa has more than 40 estuarine, eight marine, and about 90 riverine islands. The total navigable length of Goa's rivers is . Goa has more than 300 ancient water-tanks built during the rule of the Kadamba dynasty and over 100 medicinal springs.\n\nThe Mormugao harbour on the mouth of the River Zuari is one of the best natural harbours in South Asia.\n\nMost of Goa's soil cover is made up of laterites rich in ferric-aluminium oxides and reddish in colour. Further inland and along the riverbanks, the soil is mostly alluvial and loamy. The soil is rich in minerals and humus, thus conducive to agriculture. Some of the oldest rocks in the Indian subcontinent are found in Goa between Molem and Anmod on Goa's border with Karnataka. The rocks are classified as Trondjemeitic Gneiss estimated to be 3,600 million years old, dated by rubidium isotope dating. A specimen of the rock is exhibited at Goa University.\n\nGoa features a tropical monsoon climate under the Köppen climate classification. Goa, being in the tropical zone and near the Arabian Sea, has a hot and humid climate for most of the year. The month of May is usually the hottest, seeing daytime temperatures of over coupled with high humidity. The state's three seasons are: Southwest monsoon period (June – September), post-monsoon period (October – January) and fair weather period (February – May). Over 90% of the average annual rainfall (120 inches) is received during the monsoon season.\n\nThe state is divided into two districts: North Goa and South Goa. Each district is administered by a district collector, appointed by the Indian government.\n\nPanaji is the headquarters of North Goa district and is also the capital of Goa.\n\nNorth Goa is further divided into three subdivisions – Panaji, Mapusa, and Bicholim; and five taluks – Ilhas de Goa (Tiswadi), Bardez (Mapusa), Pernem, Bicholim, and Sattari (Valpoi),\n\nMargão is the headquarters of South Goa district.\n\nSouth Goa is further divided into five subdivisions – Ponda, Mormugao (Vasco da Gama), Margao, Quepem, and Dharbandora; and seven \"taluks\" – Ponda, Mormugao, Salcete (Margao), Quepem, and Canacona (Chaudi), Sanguem, and Dharbandora. (Ponda Taluka shifted from North Goa to South Goa in January 2015).\n\nGoa's major cities include Panaji, Margao, Vasco da Gama, Mapusa, Ponda and Valpoi.\n\nPanaji has the only Municipal Corporation in Goa.\n\nThere are thirteen Municipal Councils: Margao, Mormugao (including Vasco da Gama), Pernem, Mapusa, Bicholim, Sanquelim, Valpoi, Ponda, Cuncolim, Quepem, Curchorem, Sanguem, and Canacona. Goa has a total number of 334 villages.\n\nThe politics of Goa are a result of the uniqueness of this region due to 450 years of Portuguese rule, in comparison to three centuries of British colonialism experienced by the rest of India. The Indian National Congress was unable to achieve electoral success in the first two decades after the State's incorporation into India. Instead, the state was dominated by the regional political parties like Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and the United Goans Party.\n\nGovernment<br>\nIn the Parliament of India, Goa has two seats in the Lok Sabha (House of the People), one representing each district, and one seat in the Rajya Sabha (Council of the States).\n\nGoa's administrative capital is Panaji in English, Pangim in Portuguese, and Ponjê in the local language. It lies on the left bank of the Mandovi. The seat of the Goa Legislative Assembly is in Porvorim, across the Mandovi from Panaji. As the state comes under the Bombay High Court, Panaji has a bench of it. Unlike other states, which follow the British Indian model of civil laws framed for individual religions, the Portuguese Goa Civil Code, a uniform code based on the Napoleonic code, has been retained in Goa.\n\nGoa has a unicameral legislature of 40 members, headed by a speaker. The Chief Minister heads the executive, which is made up from the party or coalition elected with a majority in the legislature. The Governor, the head of the state, is appointed by the President of India. After having stable governance for nearly thirty years up to 1990, Goa is now notorious for its political instability having seen fourteen governments in the span of the fifteen years between 1990 and 2005. In March 2005 the assembly was dissolved by the Governor and President's Rule was declared, which suspended the legislature. A by-election in June 2005 saw the Indian National Congress coming back to power after winning three of the five seats that went to polls. The Congress Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are the two largest parties in the state. In the assembly poll of 2007, the INC-led coalition won and formed the government. In the 2012 Vidhan Sabha Elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party along with the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party won a clear majority, forming the new government with Manohar Parrikar as the Chief Minister. Other parties include the United Goans Democratic Party, the Nationalist Congress Party. In the 2017 assembly elections, the Indian National Congress gained the most seats, with the BJP coming in second. However, no party was able to gain a majority in the 40 member house. The BJP was invited to form the Government by Governor Mridula Sinha. The Congress claimed the use of money power on the part of the BJP and took the case to the Supreme Court. However, the Manohar Parikkar led Government was able to prove its majority in the Supreme Court mandated \"floor test\".\n\nEquatorial forest cover in Goa stands at , most of which is owned by the government. Government owned forest is estimated at whilst private is given as . Most of the forests in the state are located in the interior eastern regions of the state. The Western Ghats, which form most of eastern Goa, have been internationally recognised as one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. In the February 1999 issue of \"National Geographic Magazine\", Goa was compared with the Amazon and the Congo basins for its rich tropical biodiversity.\n\nGoa's wildlife sanctuaries boast of more than 1512 documented species of plants, over 275 species of birds, over 48 kinds of animals and over 60 genera of reptiles.\n\nGoa is also known for its coconut cultivation. The coconut tree has been reclassified by the government as a palm (like a grass), enabling farmers and real estate developers to clear land with fewer restrictions.\n\nRice is the main food crop, and pulses (legume), \"Ragi\" (Finger Millet) and other food crops are also grown. Main cash crops are coconut, cashewnut, arecanut, sugarcane and fruits like pineapple, mango and banana. Goa's state animal is the Gaur, the state bird is the Ruby Throated Yellow Bulbul, which is a variation of Black-crested Bulbul, and the state tree is the Matti(Asna).\n\nThe important forests products are bamboo canes, Maratha barks, chillar barks and the bhirand. Coconut trees are ubiquitous and are present in almost all areas of Goa barring the elevated regions. A large number of deciduous trees, such as teak, Sal tree, cashew and mango trees are present. Fruits include jackfruit, mango, pineapple and \"black-berry\" (\"podkoam\" in Konkani language). Goa's forests are rich with medicinal plants.Foxes, wild boar and migratory birds are found in the jungles of Goa. The avifauna (bird species) includes kingfisher, \"myna\" and parrot. Numerous types of fish are also caught off the coast of Goa and in its rivers. Crab, lobster, shrimp, jellyfish, oysters and catfish are the basis of the marine fishery. Goa also has a high snake population. Goa has many famous \"National Parks\", including the renowned Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary on the island of Chorão. Other wildlife sanctuaries include the Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary, Molem Wildlife Sanctuary, Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary, Madei Wildlife Sanctuary, Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary, and Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nGoa has more than 33% of its geographic area under government forests (1224.38 km²) of which about 62% has been brought under Protected Areas (PA) of Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Park. Since there is a substantial area under private forests and a large tract under cashew, mango, coconut, etc. plantations, the total forest and tree cover constitutes 56.6% of the geographic area.\n\nGoa's state domestic product for 2017 is estimated at $11 billion at current prices. Goa is India's richest state with the highest GDP per capita – two and a half times that of the country – with one of its fastest growth rates: 8.23% (yearly average 1990–2000).\nTourism is Goa's primary industry: it gets 12% of foreign tourist arrivals in India. Goa has two main tourist seasons: winter and summer. In winter, tourists from abroad (mainly Europe) come, and summer (which, in Goa, is the rainy season) sees tourists from across India. Goa's net state domestic product (NSDP) was around US$7.24 billion in 2015–16.\n\nThe land away from the coast is rich in minerals and ores, and mining forms the second largest industry. Iron, bauxite, manganese, clays, limestone and silica are mined. The Mormugao port handled 31.69 million tonnes of cargo last year, which was 39% of India's total iron ore exports. Sesa Goa (now owned by Vedanta Resources) and Dempo are the lead miners. Rampant mining has been depleting the forest cover as well as posing a health hazard to the local population. Corporations are also mining illegally in some areas. During 2015–16, the total traffic handled by Mormugao port was recorded to be 20.78 million tones.\n\nAgriculture, while of shrinking importance to the economy over the past four decades, offers part-time employment to a sizeable portion of the populace. Rice is the main agricultural crop, followed by areca, cashew and coconut. Fishing employs about 40,000 people, though recent official figures indicate a decline of the importance of this sector and also a fall in catch, due perhaps, to traditional fishing giving way to large-scale mechanised trawling.\n\nMedium scale industries include the manufacturing of pesticides, fertilisers, tyres, tubes, footwear, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, wheat products, steel rolling, fruits and fish canning, cashew nuts, textiles, brewery products.\n\nCurrently there are 16 planned SEZs in Goa. The Goa government has recently decided to not allow any more special economic zones (SEZs) in Goa after strong opposition to them by political parties and the powerful Goa Catholic Church.\n\nGoa is also notable for its low priced beer, wine and spirits prices due to its very low excise duty on alcohol. Another main source of cash inflow to the state is remittance, from many of its citizens who work abroad, to their families. It is said to have some of the largest bank savings in the country.\n\nGoa is the second state in India to achieve a 100 per cent automatic telephone system with a solid network of telephone exchanges. As of September 2017, Goa had a total installed power generation capacity of 547.88 MW. Goa is also one of the few states in India to achieve 100 per cent rural electrification.\n\nA native of Goa is called a Goan. Goa has a population of 1.459 million residents, making it India's fourth smallest (after Sikkim, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh). The population has a growth rate of 8.23% per decade. There are 394 people for each square kilometre of land which is higher than national average 382 per km. Goa is the state with highest proportion of urban population with 62.17% of the population living in urban areas. The sex ratio is 973 females to 1,000 males. The birth rate is 15.70 per 1,000 people in 2007. Goa also is the state with lowest proportion of Scheduled Tribes at 0.04%.\nA relatively small Goan-Portuguese mixed race population resulted from Portuguese colonization, one estimate being that less than 100 mestiço families left in 1961 when Portugal lost the colony.\n\nThe Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language Act, 1987 makes Konkani in the Devanagari script the sole official language of Goa, but provides that Marathi may also be used \"for all or any of the official purposes\". Portuguese was the sole official language during Portuguese colonial rule. It is now, however, mostly spoken by only the elderly Portuguese-educated populations and is no longer an official language.The Government also has a policy of replying in Marathi to correspondence received in Marathi. Whilst there have been demands for according Konkani in the Roman script official status in the state, there is widespread support for keeping Konkani as the sole official language of Goa. It is however notable to mention that the entire liturgy and communication of the Catholic church in Goa is done solely in the Roman script of Konkani.\n\nKonkani is spoken as a native language by about 66.11% of the people in the state but almost all Goans can speak and understand Konkani. Other linguistic minorities in the state as per the 2011 census are speakers of Marathi (10.89%), Hindi (10.29%),Kannada (4.66%) and Urdu (2.83%).\n\nUntil 1987, Konkani was neither the official nor administrative language used by the various rulers of the State. Under the Kadambas (c. 960 – 1310) the court language was Kannada, a Dravidian language, and when under Muslim rule (1312-1370 and 1469-1510), the official and cultural language was Persian; various stones in the Goa Archaeological Museum from the period are inscribed in Kannada and Persian. During the intervening periods of Muslim rule, the Vijayanagara control of the State mandated the use of Telugu, another Dravidian language.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, in a population of 1,458,545 people, 66.1% were Hindu, 25.1% were Christian, and 8.3% were Muslim. Smaller minorities of about 0.1% each followed Sikhism, Buddhism, or Jainism.\n\nDue to the economic decline of the Estado da India from the eighteenth century, there was a large scale migration of Goan Catholics. The local Indian Christians were called \"indiacatos\" and the mixed population, mestiços by the Portuguese. The population moved from 64.5% Christians and 35% Hindus in 1851 to 50% Christians and 50% Hindus in 1900, with a steady increase in the Hindu proportion from then onwards.\n\nThe Catholics in Goa state and Daman and Diu union territory are served by the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and Daman, the primatial see of India, in which the titular Patriarchate of the East Indies is vested.\n\nTourism is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland. In 2010, there were more than 2 million tourists reported to have visited Goa, about 1.2 million of whom were from abroad. , Goa was a destination of choice for Indian and foreign tourists, particularly Britons and Russians, with limited means who wanted to party. The state was hopeful that changes could be made which would attract a more upscale demographic.\n\nGoa stands 6th in the Top 10 Nightlife cities in the world in National Geographic Travel. One of the biggest tourist attractions in Goa is water sports. Beaches like Baga and Calangute offer jet-skiing, parasailing, banana boat rides, water scooter rides, and more. Patnem beach in Palolem stood 3rd in CNN Travel's Top 20 Beaches in Asia.\n\nOver 450 years of Portuguese rule and the influence of the Portuguese culture presents to visitors to Goa a cultural environment that is not found elsewhere in India. Goa is often described as a fusion between Eastern and Western culture with Portuguese culture having a dominant position in the state be it in its architectural, cultural or social settings. The state of Goa is famous for its excellent beaches, churches, and temples. The Bom Jesus Cathedral, Fort Aguada and a new wax museum on Indian history, culture and heritage in Old Goa are other tourism destinations.\n\nGoa has two World Heritage Sites: the Bom Jesus Basilica and churches and convents of Old Goa. The basilica holds the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier, regarded by many Catholics as the patron saint of Goa (the patron of the Archdiocese of Goa is actually Saint Joseph Vaz). These are both Portuguese-era monuments and reflect a strong European character. The relics are taken down for veneration and for public viewing, as per the prerogative of the Church in Goa, not every ten or twelve years as popularly thought and propagated. The last exposition was held in 2014.\nGoa has the Sanctuary of Saint Joseph Vaz in Sancoale. Pilar monastery which holds novenas of Venerable Padre Agnelo Gustavo de Souza from 10 November to 20 November yearly. There is a claimed Marian Apparition at the Church of Saints Simon and Jude at Batim, Ganxim, near Pilar, where Goans and non-resident Goans visit. There is the statue of the bleeding Jesus on the Crucifix at the Santa Monica Convent in Velha Goa. There are churches (\"Igorzo\"), like the Baroque styled \"Nixkollounk Gorb-Sombhov Saibinnich Igorz\" (Church of the Our Lady of Immaculate Conception) in Panaji, the Gothic styled \"Mater Dei\" (\"Dêv Matechi Igorz\"/ Mother of God) church in Saligao and each church having its own style and heritage, besides \"Kopelam/ Irmidi\" (chapels).\n\nThe Velhas Conquistas regions are known for Goa-Portuguese style architecture. There are many forts in Goa such as Tiracol, Chapora, Corjuem, Aguada, Reis Magos, Nanus, Mormugao, Fort Gaspar Dias and Cabo de Rama.\n\nIn many parts of Goa, mansions constructed in the Indo-Portuguese style architecture still stand, though in some villages, most of them are in a dilapidated condition. Fontainhas in Panaji has been declared a cultural quarter, showcasing the life, architecture and culture of Goa. Influences from the Portuguese era are visible in some of Goa's temples, notably the Shanta Durga Temple, the Mangueshi Temple, the Shri Damodar Temple and the Mahalasa Temple. After 1961, many of these were demolished and reconstructed in the indigenous Indian style.\n\nGoa has three important museums: the Goa State Museum, the Naval Aviation Museum and the National Institute of Oceanography. The aviation museum is one of three in India (the others are in Delhi and Bengaluru). The Goa Science Centre is in Miramar, Panaji. The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) is in Dona Paula.\n\nHaving been a Portuguese territory for over 450 years, Goa's culture is an interesting amalgamation of both Eastern and Western styles, with the latter having a more dominant role. The tableau of Goa showcases religious harmony by focusing on the Deepastambha, the Cross and Ghode Modni followed by a chariot. Western royal attire of kings is as much part of Goa's cultural heritage as are regional dances performed depicting a unique blend of different religions and cultures of this State. Prominent local festivals are Christmas, Easter, Carnival, Diwali, Shigmo, Chavoth, Samvatsar Padvo, Dasara etc. The Goan Carnival and Christmas-new year celebrations are well known to attract a large number of tourists.\n\nThe Gomant Vibhushan Award, the highest civilian honour of the State of Goa, is given annually by Government of Goa since 2010.\n\nTraditional Goan art forms are Dekhnni, Fugdi, Corridinho, Mando, Dulpod and Fado. Goan Catholics are fond of social gatherings and Tiatr (Teatro). As part of its Portuguese history, music is an integral part of Goan homes. It is often said that \"Goans are born with music and sport\". Western musical instruments like the piano, guitars and violins are widely used in most religious and social functions of the Catholics.\n\nGoan Hindus are very fond of Natak, Bhajan and Kirtan. Many famous Indian classical singers hail from Goa, including Mogubai Kurdikar, Kishori Amonkar, Kesarbai Kerkar, Jitendra Abhisheki and Pandit Prabhakar Karekar.\n\nGoa is also known as the origin of Goa trance.\n\nNatak, Tiatr (most popular) and Jagor are the chief forms of Goa's traditional performance arts. Other forms are Ranmale, Dashavatari, Kalo, Goulankala, Lalit, Kala and Rathkala. Stories from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata along with more modern social subjects are narrated with song and dance.\n\n\"Jagor\", the traditional folk dance-drama, is performed by the Hindu Kunbi and Christian Gauda community of Goa, to seek the Devine Grace for protection and prosperity of the crop. Literal meaning of Jagor is \"jagran\" or wakeful nights. The strong belief is that the night long performance, awakens the deities once a year and they continue to remain awake throughout the year guarding the village.\n\nPerni Jagor is the ancient mask dance – drama of Goa, performed by Perni families, using well crafted and painted wooden masks, depicting various animals, birds, super natural power, deities, demons and social characters.\n\nGauda Jagor, is an impression of social life, that displays all the existing moods and modes of human characters. It is predominantly based on three main characters, Gharasher, Nikhandar and Parpati wearing shining dress and headgears. The performance is accompanied by vibrant tunes of Goan folk instruments like Nagara/Dobe, Ghumat, Madale and Kansale.\n\nIn some places, Jagor performances are held with participation of both Hindus and Christian community, whereby, characters are played by Hindus and musical support is provided by Christian artistes.\n\n\"Tiatr (Teatro)\" and its artists play a major role in keeping the Konkani language & music alive. Tiatr's are conducted solely in the Roman script of Konkani as it is primarily a Christian community based act. They are played in scenes with music at regular intervals, the scenes are portrayals of daily life and are known to depict social and cultural scenarios. Tiatrs are regularly held especially on weekends mainly at Kala Academy, Panaji, Pai Tiatrist Hall at Ravindra Bhavan, Margao and most recent shows have also started at the new Ravindra Bhavan, Baina, Vasco. Western Musical Instruments such as Drums, bass, Keyboards, Trumpets etc. are part of the show and most of them are played acoustically. It is one of Goa's few art forms that is renowned across the world with performances popular among Goans in the Middle-East, Americas and Europe.\n\nKonkani cinema is an Indian film industry, where films are made in the Konkani language, which is spoken mainly in the Indian states of Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka and to a smaller extent in Kerala. Konkani films have been produced in Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala.\n\nThe first full length Konkani film was \"Mogacho Anvddo\", released on 24 April 1950, and was produced and directed by A. L.Jerry Braganza, a native of Mapusa, under the banner of ETICA Pictures. Hence, 24 April is celebrated as Konkani Film Day.\n\nSince 2004, starting from the 35th edition, the International Film Festival of India moved its permanent venue to Goa, it is annually held in the months of November and December.\n\nKonkani film Paltadcho manis has been included in the world's best films of 2009 list.\n\nKonkani films are eligible for the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Konkani. The most commercially successful Konkani film (as of June 2011) is O Maria directed by Rajendra Talak.\n\nIn 2012, the whole new change adopted in Konkani Cinema by introducing Digital Theatrical Film \"The Victim\" directed by Milroy Goes.\n\nSome old Konkani films are \"Sukhachem Sopon\", \"Amchem Noxib\", \"Nirmonn\", \"Mhoji Ghorkarn\", \"Kortubancho Sonvsar\", \"Jivit Amchem Oxem\", \"Mog ani Moipas\", \"Bhuierantlo Munis\", \"Suzanne\", \"Boglantt\", \"Padri\" and \"Bhogsonne\". Ujwadu is a 2011 Konkani film directed by Kasargod Chinna and produced by KJ Dhananjaya and Anuradha Padiyar.\n\nRice with fish curry (\"xit koddi\" in Konkani) is the staple diet in Goa. Goan cuisine is famous for its rich variety of fish dishes cooked with elaborate recipes. Coconut and coconut oil are widely used in Goan cooking along with chili peppers, spices, and vinegar is used in the Catholic cuisine, giving the food a unique flavour. The Goan cuisine is heavily influenced by Portuguese cuisine.\n\nGoan food may be divided into Goan Catholic and Goan Hindu cuisine with each showing very distinct tastes, characteristics, and cooking styles. Pork dishes such as Vindalho, Xacuti, chouriço, and Sorpotel are cooked for major occasions among the Goan Catholics. An exotic Goan vegetable stew, known as Khatkhate, is a very popular dish during the celebrations of festivals, Hindu and Christian alike. Khatkhate contains at least five vegetables, fresh coconut, and special Goan spices that add to the aroma.\n\nSannas, \"Hitt\", are variants of idli and \"Polle\", \"Amboli\", and \"Kailoleo\" are variants of dosa; all are native to Goa. A rich egg-based, multi-layered sweet dish known as bebinca is a favourite at Christmas.\n\nThere are some places in Goa which are famous for Goa's traditional & special cuisines. Ros omelette is one of the most popular snacks and street foods in Goa, it is traditionally sold on food carts on streets.\n\nThe most popular alcoholic beverage in Goa is feni; cashew feni is made from the fermentation of the fruit of the cashew tree, while coconut feni is made from the sap of toddy palms. Urrak is another local liquor prepared from Cashew fruit. In fact the bar culture is one of the unique aspects of the Goan villages where a local bar serves as a meeting point for villagers to unwind. Goa also has a rich wine culture.\n\nThe architecture of Goa is a combination of Goan, Ottoman and Portuguese styles. Since the Portuguese ruled and governed for four centuries, many churches and houses bear a striking element of the Portuguese style of architecture. Goan Hindu houses do not show any Portuguese influence, though the modern temple architecture is an amalgam of original Goan temple style with Dravidian, Hemadpanthi, Islamic, and Portuguese architecture. The original Goan temple architecture fell into disuse as the temples were demolished by the Portuguese and the \"Sthapati\" known as \"Thavayi\" in Konkani were converted to Christianity though the wooden work and the \"Kavi\" murals can still be seen. (see:Goa:Hindu temples and deities by Rui Gomes Pereira).\n\nGoa is served by almost all television channels available in India. Channels are received through cable in most parts of Goa. In the interior regions, channels are received via satellite dishes. Doordarshan, the national television broadcaster, has two free terrestrial channels on air.\n\nDTH (Direct To Home) TV services are available from Dish TV, Videocon D2H, Tata Sky & DD Direct Plus. The All India Radio is the only radio channel in the state that broadcasts on both FM and AM bands. Two AM channels are broadcast, the primary channel at 1287 kHz and the Vividh Bharati channel at 1539 kHz. AIR's FM channel is called FM Rainbow and is broadcast at 105.4 MHz. A number of private FM radio channels are available, Big FM at 92.7 and Radio Indigo at 91.9 MHz. There is also an educational radio channel, Gyan Vani, run by IGNOU broadcast from Panaji at 107.8 MHz. In 2006, St Xavier's College, Mapusa, became the first college in the state to launch a campus community radio station \"Voice of Xavier's\".\n\nMajor cellular service operators include Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar, Idea Cellular, Telenor, Reliance Infocomm, Tata DoCoMo, BSNL CellOne and Jio.\n\nLocal publications include the English language \"O Heraldo\" (Goa's oldest, once a Portuguese language paper), \"The Gomantak Times\" and \"The Navhind Times\". In addition to these, \"The Times of India\" and \"The Indian Express\" are also received from Mumbai and Bangalore in the urban areas. \"The Times of India\" has recently started publication from Goa itself, serving the local population news directly from the state capital. Among the list of officially accredited newspapers are \"O Heraldo\", \"The Navhind Times\" and \"The Gomantak Times\" in English; \"Bhaangar Bhuin\" in Konkani (Devanagari script); and \"Tarun Bharat\", \"Gomantak\", \"Navprabha\", \"Goa Times\", \"Sanatan Prabhat\", \"Govadoot\" and \"Lokmat\" (all in Marathi).

Its origins in the state are traced back to 1883 when the visiting Irish priest Fr. William Robert Lyons established the sport as part of a \"Christian education\". On 22 December 1959 the \"Associação de Futebol de Goa\" was formed, which continues to administer the game in the state under the new name Goa Football Association. Goa, along with West Bengal and Kerala is the locus of football in India and is home to many football clubs in the national I-League. The state's football powerhouses include Salgaocar, Dempo, Churchill Brothers, Vasco, Sporting Clube de Goa and FC Goa. The first Unity World Cup was held in Goa in 2014. The state's main football stadium, Fatorda Stadium, is located at Margao and also hosts cricket matches. The state hosted few matches of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Fatorda Stadium.\n\nA number of Goans have represented India in football and six of them, namely Samir Naik, Climax Lawrence, Brahmanand Sankhwalkar, Bruno Coutinho, Mauricio Afonso and Roberto Fernandes have all captained the national team. Goa has its own state football team and league, the Goa Professional League. It is probably the only state in India where cricket is not considered the most important of all sports.\n\nGoa also has its own cricket team. Dilip Sardesai remains the only Goan to date to play international cricket for India.\n\nThe Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has won the right to host the Asian Beach Games in 2020.\n\nGoa had India's earliest educational institutions built with European support. The Portuguese set up seminaries for religious education and parish schools for elementary education. Founded circa 1542 by saint Francis Xavier, Saint Paul's College, Goa was a Jesuit school in Old Goa, which later became a college. St Paul's was once the main Jesuit institution in the whole of Asia. It housed the first printing press in India and published the first books in 1556.\n\nMedical education began in 1801 with the offering of regular medical courses at the Royal and Military Hospital in the old City of Goa. Built in 1842 as the Escola Médico-Cirúrgica de (Nova) Goa (Medical-Surgical School of Goa), Goa Medical College is one of Asia's oldest medical colleges and has one of the oldest medical libraries (since 1845). It houses the largest hospital in Goa and continues to provide medical training to this day.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Goa has a literacy rate of 87%, with 90% of males and 84% of females being literate. Each taluka is made up of villages, each having a school run by the government. Private schools are preferred over government run schools. All schools come under the Goa Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education, whose syllabus is prescribed by the state education department. There are also a few schools that subscribe to the all-India ICSE syllabus or the NIOS syllabus. Most students in Goa complete their high school with English as the medium of instruction. Most primary schools, however, use Konkani and Marathi (in private, but government-aided schools). As is the case in most of India, enrolment for vernacular media has seen a fall in numbers in favour of English medium education. As per a report published in \"The Times of India\", 84% of Goan primary schools run without an administrative head.\n\nSome notable schools in Goa include Sharada Mandir School in Miramar, Loyola High School in Margao and The King's School in São José de Areal. After ten years of schooling, students join a Higher Secondary school, which offers courses in popular streams such as Science, Arts, Law and Commerce. A student may also opt for a course in vocational studies. Additionally, they may join three-year diploma courses. Two years of college is followed by a professional degree programme. Goa University, the sole university in Goa, is located in Taleigão and most Goan colleges are affiliated to it.\n\nThere are six engineering colleges in the state. Goa Engineering College and National Institute of Technology Goa are government funded colleges whereas the private engineering colleges include Don Bosco College of Engineering at Fatorda, Shree Rayeshwar Institute of Engineering and Information Technology at Shiroda, Agnel Institute of Technology and Design (AITD), Assagao, Bardez and Padre Conceicao College of Engineering at Verna. In 2004, BITS Pilani one of the premier institutes in India, inaugurated its second campus, the BITS Pilani Goa Campus, at Zuarinagar near Dabolim. The Indian Institute of Technology Goa (IIT Goa) began functioning from its temporary campus, located in Goa Engineering College since 2016. The site for permanent campus was finalized in Cotarli, Sanguem.\n\nThere are colleges offering pharmacy, architecture and dentistry along with numerous private colleges offering law, arts, commerce and science. There are also two National Oceanographic Science related centres: the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research in Vasco da Gama and the National Institute of Oceanography in Dona Paula.\n\nGoa Institute of Management located at Sanquelim, near Panaji is one of India's premier business schools.\n\nIn addition to the engineering colleges, there are government polytechnic institutions in Panaji, Bicholim and Curchorem, and aided institutions like Father Agnel Polytechnic in Verna and the Institute of Shipbuilding Technology in Vasco da Gama which impart technical and vocational training.\n\nOther colleges in Goa include Shri Damodar College of Commerce and Economics, V.V.M's R.M. Salgaocar Higher Secondary School in Margao, G.V.M's S.N.J.A higher secondary school, Don Bosco College, D.M.'s College of Arts, Science and Commerce, St Xavier's College, Carmel College, The Parvatibai Chowgule College, Dhempe College, Damodar College, MES College, S.

Samiti's Higher Secondary School of Science and Rosary College of Commerce & Arts.\n\nGoa International Airport, is a civil enclave at INS Hansa, a Naval airfield located at Dabolim near Vasco da Gama. The airport caters to scheduled domestic and international air services. Goa has scheduled international connections to Doha, Dubai, Muscat, Sharjah and Kuwait in the Middle East by airlines like Air Arabia, Air India, GoAir, Indigo, Oman Air, SpiceJet, Jet Airways, JetKonnect and Qatar Airways. The proposed greenfield Mopa Airport will be built at Mopa in Pernem taluka.\n\nGoa's public transport largely consists of privately operated buses linking the major towns to rural areas. Government-run buses, maintained by the Kadamba Transport Corporation, link major routes (like the Panaji–Margao route) and some remote parts of the state. The Corporation owns 15 bus stands, 4 depots and one Central workshop at Porvorim and a Head Office at Porvorim. In large towns such as Panajiand Margao, intra-city buses operate. However, public transport in Goa is less developed, and residents depend heavily on their own transportation, usually motorised two-wheelers and small family cars.\nGoa has four National Highways passing through it. NH-66 (ex NH-17) runs along India's west coast and links Goa to Mumbai in the north and Mangalore to the south. NH-4A running across the state connects the capital Panaji to Belgaum in east, linking Goa to cities in the Deccan. The NH-366 (ex NH-17A) connects NH-66 to Mormugao Port from Cortalim. The new NH-566 (ex NH-17B) is a four-lane highway connecting Mormugao Port to NH-66 at Verna via Dabolim Airport, primarily built to ease pressure on the NH-366 for traffic to Dabolim Airport and Vasco da Gama. NH-768 (ex NH-4A) links Panaji and Ponda to Belgaum and NH-4. Goa has a total of of national highways, of state highway and of district highway. National Highways in Goa are among the narrowest in the country and will remain so for the foreseeable future, as the state government has received an exemption that allows narrow national highways. In Kerala, highways are wide. In other states National Highways are grade separated highways wide with a minimum of four lanes, as well as 6 or 8 lane access-controlled expressways.\n\nHired forms of transport include unmetered taxis and, in urban areas, auto rickshaws. Another form of transportation in Goa is the motorcycle taxi, operated by drivers who are locally called \"pilots\". These vehicles transport a single pillion rider, at fares that are usually negotiated. Other than buses, \"pilots\" tend to be the cheapest mode of transport. River crossings in Goa are serviced by flat-bottomed ferry boats, operated by the river navigation department.\n\nGoa has two rail lines – one run by the South Western Railway and the other by the Konkan Railway. The line run by the South Western Railway was built during the colonial era linking the port town of Vasco da Gama, Goa with Belgaum, Hubli, Karnataka via Margao. The Konkan Railway line, which was built during the 1990s, runs parallel to the coast connecting major cities on the western coast.\n\nThe Mormugao harbour near the city of Vasco handles mineral ore, petroleum, coal, and international containers. Much of the shipments consist of minerals and ores from Goa's hinterland. Panaji, which is on the banks of the Mandovi, has a minor port, which used to handle passenger steamers between Goa and Mumbai till the late 1980s. There was also a short-lived catamaran service linking Mumbai and Panaji operated by Damania Shipping in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It finds mention in one hymn of the Rigveda (RV 10.121), known as the Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta, suggesting a single creator deity (verse 8: \"\", Griffith: \"He is the God of gods, and none beside him.\"), identified in the hymn as Prajāpati. The concept of the \"golden womb\" is again mentioned in the Vishvakarman Sūkta (RV 10.82).\n\nThe Upanishad calls it the Soul of the Universe or Brahman, and elaborates that Hiraṇyagarbha floated around in emptiness and the darkness of the non-existence for about a year, and then broke into two halves which formed the \"Svarga\" and the \"Pṛthvi\".\n\nIn classical Purāṇic Hinduism, Hiraṇyagarbha is the term used in the Vedanta for the \"creator\". Hiraṇyagarbha is also Brahmā, so called because he was born from a golden egg (Manu Smṛti 1.9), while the Mahābhārata calls it the Manifest.\n\nHiraṇyagarbha is also a sacrifice, where it is known as Hiraṇyagarbha Yagna. This sacrifice was performed by the founder of the Rashtrakuta dynasty, Dantidurga, to confer Kshatriyahood on himself, as he was not born a Kshatriya but wanted to overthrow his Chalukya overlord to set up the Rashtrakuta empire, and in olden days, the Caste System in India was very prevalent and he was not accepted by the people as their King, until he conferred Kshatriyahood upon himself.\n\nSome classical yoga traditions consider Hiraṇyagarbha as the originator of yoga, though this may also be a name for Rishi Kapila.\n\nMatsya Purāṇa (2.25-30) gives an account of initial creation. After Mahāprālaya, the great dissolution of the Universe, there was darkness everywhere. Everything was in a state of sleep. There was nothing, either moving or static. Then Svayambhu, self-manifested Being arose, which is a form beyond senses. It created the primordial waters first and established the seed of creation into it. The seed turned into a golden womb, Hiraṇyagarbha. Then Svayambhu entered in the egg.\n\nThe Nārāyaṇa Sūkta exclaims that everything that is, visible or invisible, all this is pervaded by Nārāyaṇa within and without.\n\nThe Īśvara Upaniṣad says that the universe is pervaded by Īśvara (God), who is both within and without it. He is the moving and the unmoving, He is far and near, He is within all these and without all these.\n\nThe Vedānta Sūtra further states that Brahman is That from Whom this Universe proceeds, in Whom it subsists, and to Whom, in the end, it returns.\n\nThe Saṃkhya school holds that there are only two primary principles, Puruṣa and Prākṛti, and creation is only a manifestation or evolution of the constituents of Prākṛti due to the action of Puruṣa's Consciousness.\n\nThe Bhagavata states that Nārāyaṇa alone was in the beginning, who was the pious of principles of creation, sustenance, and dissolution (also known as the Hindu Trinity of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Shiva) - the Supreme Hari, multi-headed, multi-eyed, multi-footed, multi-armed, multi-limbed. This was the Supreme Seed of all creation, subtler than the subtlest, greater than the greatest, larger than the largest, and more magnificent than even the best of all things, more powerful, than even the wind and all the gods, more resplendent than the Sun and the Moon, and more internal than even the mind and the intellect. He is the Creator, the Supreme. The term can also mean as He who, having become first the Creator, has come to be considered as the womb of all objects.\n\nThe Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta of the Rigveda declares that God manifested Himself in the beginning as the Creator of the Universe, encompassing all things, including everything within Himself, the collective totality, as it were, of the whole of creation, animating it as the Supreme Intelligence.\n\n<poem>\nहिरण्यगर्भः समवर्तताग्रे भूतस्य जातः पतिरेकासीत ।\nस दाधार पृथ्वीं ध्यामुतेमां कस्मै देवायहविषा विधेम ॥\"\nhiraṇyagarbhaḥ samavartatāgre bhūtasya jātaḥ patirekāsīta |\nsa dādhāra pṛthvīṃ dhyāmutemāṃ kasmai devāyahaviṣā vidhema ||\n\nय आत्मदा बलदा यस्य विश्व उपासते प्रशिषं यस्यदेवाः ।\nयस्य छायाऽमृतं यस्य मृत्युः कस्मै देवाय हविषा विधेम ॥\nya ātmadā baladā yasya viśva upāsate praśiṣaṃ yasyadevāḥ |\nyasya chāyāmṛtaṃ yasya martyuḥ kasmai devāyahaviṣā vidhema ||\n\nयः प्राणतो निमिषतो महित्वैक इद्राजा जगतो बभूव ।\nय ईशे अस्य द्विपदश्चतुष्पदः कस्मै देवाय हविषाविधेम ॥\nyaḥ prāṇato nimiṣato mahitvaika idrājā jagato babhūva |\nya īśe asya dvipadaścatuṣpadaḥ kasmai devāya haviṣāvidhema ||\n\nयस्येमे हिमवन्तो महित्वा यस्य समुद्रं रसया सहाहुः ।\nयस्येमाः परदिशो यस्य बाहू कस्मै देवाय हविषाविधेम ॥\nyasyeme himavanto mahitvā yasya samudraṃ rasayā sahāhuḥ |\nyasyemāḥ paradiśo yasya bāhū kasmai devāya haviṣāvidhema ||\n\nयेन द्यौरुग्रा पृथ्वी च दृढा येन स्वस्तभितं येननाकः ।\nयो अन्तरिक्षे रजसो विमानः कस्मै देवाय हविषा विधेम ॥\nyena dayaurugrā parthivī ca darḻhā yena sava satabhitaṃ yenanākaḥ |\nyo antarikṣe rajaso vimānaḥ kasmai devāyahaviṣā vidhema ||\n\nयं करन्दसी अवसा तस्तभाने अभ्यैक्षेतां मनसारेजमाने ।\nयत्राधि सूर उदितो विभाति कस्मै देवायहविषा विधेम ॥\nyaṃ karandasī avasā tastabhāne abhyaikṣetāṃ manasārejamāne |\nyatrādhi sūra udito vibhāti kasmai devāyahaviṣā vidhema ||\n\nआपो ह यद बर्हतीर्विश्वमायन गर्भं दधानाजनयन्तीरग्निम ।\nततो देवानां समवर्ततासुरेकःकस्मै देवाय हविषा विधेम ॥\nāpo ha yada barhatīrviśvamāyana garbhaṃ dadhānājanayantīragnima |\ntato devānāṃ samavartatāsurekaḥkasmai devāya haviṣā vidhema ||\n\nयश्चिदापो महिना पर्यपश्यद दक्षं दधानाजनयन्तीर्यज्ञम ।\nयो देवेष्वधि देव एक आसीत कस्मैदेवाय हविषा विधेम ॥\nyaścidāpo mahinā paryapaśyada dakṣaṃ dadhānājanayantīryajñama |\nyo deveṣvadhi deva eka āsīta kasmaidevāya haviṣā vidhema ||\n\nमा नो हिंसीज्जनिता यः पर्थिव्या यो वा दिवंसत्यधर्मा जजान ।\nयश्चापश्चन्द्रा बर्हतीर्जजानकस्मै देवाय हविषा विधेम ॥\nmā no hiṃsījjanitā yaḥ parthivyā yo vā divaṃsatyadharmā jajāna |\nyaścāpaścandrā barhatīrjajānakasmai devāya haviṣā vidhema ||\n\nप्रजापते नत्वदेतान्यन्यो विश्वा जातानि परिताबभूव ।\nयत्कामास्ते जुहुमस्तन्नो अस्तु वयं स्याम पतयोरयीणाम् ॥\nparajāpate na tavadetānyanyo viśvā jātāni pari tābabhūva |\nyatkāmāste juhumastana no astu vayaṃ sayāma patayorayīṇāma ||\n\n</poem>\n\nIn the beginning was the Divinity in his splendour, manifested as the sole Lord of land, skies, water, space and that beneath and He upheld the earth and the heavens.\n\nWho is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?\n\nIt is that who bestows soul-force and vigor, whose guidance all men invoke, the Devas invoke whose shadow is immortal life and death.\n\nWho is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?\n\nIt is that who by His greatness became the One King of the breathing and the seeing, who is the Lord of man and bird and beast.\n\nWho is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?\n\nIt is that through whose glory the snow-clad mountains rose, and the ocean spread with the river, they say.

Its current chief executive is Karen Pollock, who was awarded an MBE for her services to Holocaust education in 2012.\n\nIts chairman is Paul Phillips and its president is Stephen Rubin. Its honorary patrons include Lord Carey, Lord Dholakia, Lord Mackay of Clashfern and Elie Wiesel.\n\nOne of the Trust's main achievements was ensuring that the Holocaust formed part of the National Curriculum for history, as it continues to do so.\n\nThe charity changed its logo in 2008. It celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013.\n\nUnder its Outreach Programme, the HET arranges visits to schools by Holocaust survivors, often accompanied by one of its own educators. The trust helps several hundred teachers a year to teach more effectively about the Holocaust, including both PGCE students and practising teachers. The trust organises an annual intensive ten-day course in Israel for teachers, in partnership with the International School for Holocaust Studies at Yad Vashem.\n\nThe Trust arranges visits to Auschwitz-Birkenau, by UK region, for two sixth-form students from participating schools and colleges. Around 150 students take part in one project at any time. A \"Guardian\" reporter who accompanied such a visit in 1999 wrote:\nTrust members knew from experience, both personal and from the teachers' trip to Auschwitz earlier this year, that this visit would be tough... Seeing one horrendous exhibit after another was relentless and exhausting – many of us ended up numb, stunned, freezing cold. Then we felt awful – how dare we find it too much after a few hours?\n\nIn 2006, more than 400 students made such visits. This project is supported by a £1.5 million grant from the Treasury, enabling two students from every secondary school and further education college in Britain to visit Auschwitz each year. \nThe project involves four stages:\n\nOn 18 October 2012, the Holocaust Educational Trust marked its 100th \"Lessons from Auschwitz\" project trip. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was among those in attendance.\n\nOn 2 May 2013, the Scottish government announced that it will provide £510,000 of additional funding for the \"Lessons from Auschwitz\" project over the next two years.\n\nOn 8 July 2013, a groundbreaking seminar for over 500 young people was held in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London to mark the launch of the new Ambassador Programme. The Trust's Chief Executive, Karen Pollock, describes HET Ambassadors as \"young people that have shown a commitment to enabling as many people as possible to benefit from what they have learnt.\" The 500 young Ambassadors - who have all participated in the Trust's \"Lessons from Auschwitz\" Project - bore witness to speakers including world-renowned historians, Professors Yehuda Bauer and David Cesarani, BBC Political Editor, Nick Robinson and Director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti CBE.\n\nAs part of the Ambassador Programme, a cohort of 25 Regional Ambassadors (coinciding with the charity's 25th anniversary) were appointed to help strengthen the now 20,000 strong Ambassador community by providing an Ambassador representative for each region in addition to the Trust's Ambassador Outreach Officer. This has secured a visible presence of HET Ambassadors all across the United Kingdom, covering the regions of England (South West, South East, London and Thames Valley Chilterns, Eastern, Yorkshire and Humber and North West, East Midlands, North East, West Midlands), Scotland and Wales.\n\nOn the eve of 8 July 2013, after the Ambassador Conference, Regional Ambassadors attended a reception in Speaker's House in the Palace of Westminster, along with MPs, Peers and Supporters of the Trust, to celebrate the launch of the Ambassador Programme. Attendees heard from the Rt. Hon John Bercow MP and Lord Browne of Madingley, the former Chief Executive of BP and head of the Ambassador Programme. Lord Browne also chaired a steering group with Regional Ambassadors on 9 July 2013 along with Doreen Lawrence OBE, Prof. Yehuda Bauer and Holocaust survivor, Kitty Hart-Moxon, discussing \"why and how we remember the Holocaust and how we can communicate its relevance in contemporary British society.\"\n\nBetween 18 and 26 July 2013, for the first time, a select team of young people belonging to the HET Ambassador community, attended a seminar in Holocaust Studies at the International School for Holocaust Studies at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.\n\nFrom 2008, the Trust campaigned to have British people such as Frank Foley, who had assisted in the rescue of Holocaust victims, posthumously recognised with official British Honours. The Government created the British Hero of the Holocaust medal, awarding it in March 2010 to 25 people posthumously, as well as to Sir Nicholas Winton and Denis Avey.\n\n"}

Sailing to Spain at 21, he was educated informally there, where he lived and worked the rest of his life. The natural son of a Spanish conquistador and an Inca noblewoman born in the early years of the conquest, he is recognized primarily for his chronicles of Inca history, culture, and society. His work was widely read in Europe, influential and well received. It was the first literature by an author born in the Americas to enter the western canon.\n\nAfter his father's death in 1559, Vega moved to Spain in 1561, seeking official acknowledgement as his father's son. His paternal uncle became a protector, and he lived in Spain for the rest of his life, where he wrote his histories of the Inca culture and Spanish conquest, as well as an account of de Soto's expedition in Florida.\n\nBorn Gómez Suárez de Figueroa, in Cuzco, Peru, in 1539, he was the natural son of a Spanish conqueror and encomendero and a royal Inca mother. He was born during the early years of the Spanish conquest. His father was Spanish captain and conquistador Sebastián Garcilaso de la Vega y Vargas (d. 1559). His mother was an Inca princess, Palla Chimpu Ocllo, who was baptized after the fall of Cuzco as Isabel Suárez Chimpu Ocllo. She was descended from Inca nobility, a daughter of Túpac Huallpa and a granddaughter (not a niece) of the powerful Inca Tupac Yupanqui. Because his parents were not married in the Catholic Church, he was illegitimate and the boy was given only his mother's surname. Under the Spanish system of caste that developed, he would have been classified as a criollo (for being of Spanish descent, born in South America) and mestizo (for his mixed parents).\n\nWhen Gómez was young, his father abandoned his mother and married a much younger Spanish woman. As such, Gómez lived with his mother, her husband Juan de Pedroche, her Inca family and had two daughters, De la Vega's half-sisters Ana Ruíz, who went on to marry Martín de Bustinza, and Luisa de Herrera, who married Pedro Márquez de Galeoto (one of their children was Alonso Márquez de Figueroa). His first language was Quecha, but he also learned Spanish from early boyhood. He lived with his mother's family for the first ten years of his life before his father took the boy into his household and gave him an education. Garcilaso received an inheritance when his father died in 1559. The next year, at the age of 21, he left Peru for Spain.\n\nSuárez de Figueroa reached Spain in 1561 while there was still fighting in his native country under the conquest. The Spanish did not achieve their final victory until 1572. He traveled to Montilla, where he met his father's brother, Alonso de Vargas, who acted as the young man's protector and helped him make his way. The younger man soon traveled to Madrid to seek official acknowledgement as his father's son from the Crown, and he was allowed to take the name of Garcilaso de la Vega. Also referred to as \"El Inca\" or \"Inca Garcilaso de la Vega\", he received an informal education in Spain. Together with his uncle's support, gaining his father's name helped him integrate into Spanish society.\n\nHe remained in Spain and did not return to his native country, now Peru. As warfare continued in the conquest, he was at political and even physical risk there because of his royal Inca lineage. It is recorded that he died in Córdoba on 23 April 1616, but it could have been up to two days earlier because of the inaccuracy of the existing documents.\n\nHe had at least two sons, born of relationships with different servants. One son was recorded as being born in 1570; he might have died at a very young age. With another servant, Garcilaso had a second son, Diego de Vargas, born in 1590, who helped his father copy the \"Royal Commentaries\" and survived him until at least 1651.\n\nIt is possible that his eldest son was the 'Admiral' Lope de Vega, who commanded a ship in the fleet of Álvaro de Mendaña, on his 1595 expedition to the Solomon Islands. Lope de Vega was lost at sea when his ship parted from Mendaña's fleet in a fog.\n\nDe la Vega entered Spanish military service in 1570 and fought in the Alpujarras against the Moors after the Morisco Revolt. He received the rank of captain for his services to the Crown.\n\nHe received a first-rate but informal European education in Spain after he moved there at age 21. His works are considered to have great literary value and are not simple historical chronicles. He wrote from an important perspective, as his maternal family were the ruling Inca. He portrays the Inca as benevolent rulers who governed a country where everybody was well-fed and happy before the Spanish came. Having learned first-hand about daily Inca life from his maternal relatives, he was able to convey that in his writings. As an adult, he also gained the perspective to describe accurately the political system of tribute and labor enforced by the Incas from the subsidiary tribes in their empire.\n\nBaptized and reared as Christian, he portrayed Incan religion and the expansion of its empire from a viewpoint influenced by his upbringing. He did not acknowledge or discuss the human sacrifices that are now known to have been part of Inca practice. It is unknown whether that was an effort to portray his Inca ancestors in a more positive light to a Spanish audience or his ignorance of the practice having lived most of his life in Spain.\n\nDe la Vega's first work was \"La Florida del Inca\", an account of Hernando de Soto's expedition and journey in Florida. The work was published in Lisbon in 1605 and became popular. It describes the expedition according to its own records and information Garcilaso gathered during the years. He defended the legitimacy of imposing the Spanish sovereignty in conquered territories and submitting them to Christian jurisdiction. At the same time, he expresses and defends the dignity, the courage, and the rationality of the Native Americans. It was translated and published in English in 1951.\n\nHistorians have identified problems with using \"La Florida\" as an historical account. Jerald T. Milanich and Charles M. Hudson warn against relying on Garcilaso, noting serious problems with the sequence of events and location of towns in his narrative. They say that \"some historians regard Garcilaso's \"La Florida\" to be more a work of literature than a work of history.\" Lankford characterizes Garcilaso's \"La Florida\" as a collection of \"legend narratives,\" derived from a much-retold oral tradition of the survivors of the expedition. The Library of Congress in Washington, DC, has these two volumes online, scanned from an historic French-language edition published long before English editions.\n\nWhile in Spain, Garcilaso wrote his best-known work, \"Comentarios Reales de los Incas\", published in Lisbon in 1609. It was based on stories and oral histories told by his Inca relatives when he was a child in Cusco. The \"Comentarios\" have two sections and volumes. The first was primarily about Inca life. The second, about the Spanish conquest of Peru, was published in 1617. It was first published in English in London in 1685, translated by Sir Paul Rycaut and titled \"The Royal Commentaries of Peru.\" \nMore than a century and a half later, in 1758 when the uprising against colonial oppression led by Tupac Amaru II gained momentum, Charles III of Spain banned the \"Comentarios\" from being published in the Quechua language in Lima or distributed there on account of its \"dangerous\" content.\n\nThe book was not printed again in the Americas until 1918, but copies continued to be circulated secretly. It was translated and printed in English in 1961 in the United States as \"The Incas,\" and in another edition in 1965 as \"Royal Commentaries of the Incas\". (See below)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "653284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=653284", "title": "James Fergusson (architect)", "text": "James Fergusson (architect)\n\nJames Fergusson FRS (22 January 1808 – 9 January 1886) was a Scottish architectural historian, mainly remembered for his interest in Indian historical architecture and antiquities. He was an important figure in the 19th century rediscovery of ancient India. He was originally a businessman, and though not formally trained as an architect, designed some buildings and decorative schemes.\n\nFergusson was born at Ayr, the son of William Fergusson (1773–1846) an army surgeon. After being educated first at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and then at a private school in Hounslow, he went to Calcutta as a partner in a mercantile house. Here he became interested in the remains of the ancient architecture of India, little known or understood at that time. The successful conduct of an indigo factory, as he states in his own account, enabled him to retire from business after about ten years and settle in London. His observations on Indian architecture were first published in his book on \"The Rock-cut Temples of India\", published in 1845.\n\nThe task of analysing the historic and aesthetic relations of this type of ancient buildings led him further to undertake a historical and critical comparative survey of the whole subject of architecture in \"The Illustrated Handbook of Architecture, being a Concise and Popular Account of the different Styles of Architecture prevailing in all Ages and Countries\", a work which first appeared in 1855 in two volumes. It was followed in 1862 by one entitled \"A History of the Modern Styles of Architecture\", being a sequel to the \"Handbook of Architecture\".\n\nThe 1855 work was reissued ten years later in a much more extended form in three volumes, under the title of \"A History of Architecture in all Countries from the Earliest Times to the Present Day.\"\n\nThe chapters on Indian architecture, which had been considered at rather disproportionate length in the Handbook, were removed from the general History, and the whole of this subject treated more fully in a separate volume, \"The History of Indian and Eastern Architecture\", which appeared in 1876, as the fourth volume to \"The History of Architecture\". The 1876 work was later revised with additions by James Burgess and Richard Phené Spiers in 1910 and published in two volumes.\n\nFergusson was the first clearly to point out and characterise the essential difference between this and the spontaneously evolved architecture of preceding ages. His 1849 \"Historical Inquiry into the True Principles of Beauty in Art: More Especially with Reference to Architecture\" is a most thoughtful metaphysical study. Some of his essays on special points in archaeology, such as the treatise on \"The Mode in which Light was introduced into Greek Temples\", included theories on Greek temples which have not received general acceptance.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Fergusson was concerned about British preparedness to resist a French invasion and he published \"An Essay on a Proposed New System of Fortification: with Hints for its Application to our National Defences\" (1849), \"The Peril of Portsmouth; or, French Fleets and English Forts\" (1852) and \"Portsmouth Protected: a Sequel to the Peril of Portsmouth\" (1856). In 1859, he was the only civilian appointed to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which subsequently recommended a huge programme of coastal fortifications that became known as \"Palmerston's Follies\".\n\nHe received the gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1871. Among his works, besides those already mentioned, are: \"Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored\" (1851), \"Mausoleum at Halicarnassus restored\" (1862), \"Tree and Serpent Worship\" (1868), \"Rude Stone Monuments in all Countries\" (1872), and \"The Temples of the Jews and the other Buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem\" (1878). The sessional papers of the Institute of British Architects include papers by him on \"The History of the Pointed Arch\", \"Architecture of Southern India\", \"Architectural Splendour of the City of Beeja pore\", on the \"Erechtheum\" and on the \"Temple of Diana at Ephesus\".\n\nAlthough not a prolific practising architect, a small number of examples of Fergusson's architecture remain in existence, the most notable of which are the parliament building of Jamaica, and the Marianne North Gallery in Kew Gardens.\n\nFergusson was adviser with Austen Henry Layard in the scheme of decoration for the Assyrian court at The Crystal Palace, and in 1856 assumed the duties of general manager to the Crystal Palace Company, a post which he held for two years. In 1866 he was a member of a committee to advise Henry Scott on design aspects of the Royal Albert Hall, along with architects William Tite and Matthew Digby Wyatt, and the engineers John Hawkshaw and John Fowler.\n\nIn 1847 Fergusson published an Essay on the \"Ancient Topography of Jerusalem\", in which he contended that the Mosque of Omar was the identical church built by Constantine the Great over the tomb of our Lord at Jerusalem, and that it, and not the present church of the Holy Sepulchre, was the genuine burial-place of Jesus. The burden of this contention was further explained by the publication in 1860 of his \"Notes on the Site of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem\"; and \"The Temples of the Jews and the other Buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem\", published in 1878, which was a further elaboration of these theories, which are said to have been the origin of the establishment of the Palestine Exploration Fund.\n\nFergusson died in London on 9 January 1886.\n\n\n\n"}

Marrs was a prominent figure in the JFK assassination conspiracy theories community and his book \"Crossfire\" was a source for Oliver Stone's film \"JFK\". He wrote books asserting the existence of government conspiracies regarding aliens, 9/11, telepathy, and secret societies. He began his career as a news reporter in the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metroplex and taught a class on the assassination of John F. Kennedy at University of Texas at Arlington for 30 years. Marrs was a member of the Scholars for 9/11 Truth.\n\nA native of Fort Worth, Texas, Marrs earned a B.A. in journalism from the University of North Texas in 1966 and completed graduate work at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas from 1967 to 1968. Beginning in college, he worked as a reporter, cartoonist, and photographer for several Texas newspapers, including the \"Denton Record-Chronicle\", \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\", and \"Lubbock Sentinel\". In 1968, he took a position with the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\", where he served as police reporter and general assignment reporter covering stories locally, in Europe, and in the Middle East. From 1969 to 1970, he concurrently served in a stateside United States Army Reserve intelligence unit (under the aegis of the Fourth Army) as a translator of French and German periodicals; when the Army offered to remedy a longstanding shoulder ailment prior to his scheduled mobilization or release him from his service obligation, he accepted the latter option. He later became the newspaper's military and aerospace writer and an investigative reporter. After leaving the \"Star-Telegram\" to take a position with Jerre R. Todd and Associates (a public relations firm in Arlington, Texas) in 1972, he returned to the newspaper in 1974 before leaving again in 1980.\n\nFor the remainder of his career, Marrs was a freelance writer, author, and public relations professional based in exurban Springtown, Texas. From 1983 to 1984, he published a weekly newspaper (the \"Springtown Current\") in his hometown along with a monthly tourism tabloid (\"Cowtown Trails\"). Previously, he produced a cable television show (\"Texas Roundup\") from 1982 to 1983. He also served as communications director for the First Bank and Trust of Springtown from 1985 to 1995.\n\nMarrs appeared on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, C-SPAN, The Discovery Channel, TLC, The History Channel, \"Alex Jones Show\", \"This Morning America\", \"Geraldo\", \"The Montel Williams Show\", \"Today\", \"TechTV\", \"Larry King\", \"Coast to Coast AM\" (with George Noory and Art Bell) radio programs, as well as numerous national and regional radio and TV shows.\n\nIn 1989, Marrs' book, \"Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy\", was published and reached \"The New York Times\" Paperback Non-Fiction Best Seller list in mid-February 1992. It became a basis for the Oliver Stone film JFK, released in 1991.\n\nAccording to Stephen E. Ambrose in an essay generally critical of conspiracy theorists, Marrs wrote in \"Crossfire\" that motives for the murder of Kennedy were \"Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's attack on organized crime (Mafia motive); President Kennedy's failure to support the Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs Invasion (Cuban and C.I.A. motive); the 1963 Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (military–industrial complex, or M.I.C. motive); Kennedy's plan to withdraw from Vietnam before the end of 1965 (Joint Chiefs of Staff and M.I.C. motive); Kennedy's talk about taking away the oil-depletion allowance (Texas oil men motive); Kennedy's monetary policies (international bankers motive); Kennedy's decision to drop Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson from the ticket in 1964 (L.B.J. motive) and Kennedy's active civil rights policy (Texas racist billionaires motive).\"\n\nSylvia Meagher is a critic of the Warren Commission and author of \"Master Index to the JFK Assassination\" and \"Accessories After the Fact\". In April 1987, Meagher received the manuscript of Marrs' \"Crossfire.\" She was asked to evaluate the book by Simon & Schuster, which was considering publishing it. Meagher concluded, \"The accuracy of the manuscript in dealing with a vast body of complex evidence is nearly impeccable ... the manuscript is, in my opinion, a fine and admirable work.\" Despite this glowing recommendation, Simon & Schuster became one of about 25 major U.S. publishers to turn down the book. It was finally published in 1989 by Carroll & Graf Publishers.\n\nBeginning in 1976, Marrs taught continuing education classes on the Kennedy assassination as an adjunct professor at the University of Texas at Arlington. He added a UFO course in 2000 before retiring from teaching in 2007.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1995, Marrs researched and completed a non-fiction book on a top-secret government program called the Stargate Project involving the psychic phenomenon known as remote viewing, only to have the program canceled as the book was going to press in the summer of 1995.\n\nIn May 1997, Marrs' investigation of UFOs, \"Alien Agenda\", was published by HarperCollins Publishers. The paperback edition was released in mid-1998. It has been translated into several foreign languages and became the top-selling UFO book in the world. \"Publishers Weekly\" said:\n\nMarrs shows little discrimination, overemphasizing dubious phenomena like remote viewing and crop circles, and giving nearly equal weight to ludicrous pretenders like Billy Meier (who claimed close encounter with Pleiadians) and sophisticated commentators like Jacques Vallée. Marrs even devotes a chapter to theories that the moon may be a UFO, and he refuses to rule out obvious frauds like the alien autopsy tapes. But if rigorous analysis escapes Marrs, little else does; this is the most entertaining and complete overview of flying saucers and their crew in years.\n\nIn early 2000, HarperCollins published \"Rule by Secrecy\", which claimed to trace a hidden history connecting modern secret societies to ancient and medieval times. This book also reached \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list. In 2003, his book \"The War on Freedom\" probed the alleged conspiracies of the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. It was released in 2006 under the title \"The Terror Conspiracy\".\n\nMarrs was a featured speaker at a number of national conferences including the annual International UFO Congress and the annual Gulf Breeze UFO Conference, but he also spoke at local conferences, such as Conspiracy Con and The Bay Area UFO Expo.\n\nIn October 2011, Marrs started his own radio program, \"The View from Marrs\", on the Jeff Rense Radio network. The program aired on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 3 p.m. Central time. Marrs had on his show a wide variety of guests and dedicated the entire month of November to the latest information regarding the JFK assassination. He also explored UFO research, survivalism, and other topics.\n\nWith a friend, Michael H. Price, Marrs wrote and illustrated a comic book (\"Oswald's Confession & Other Tales from the War\") that was published by Cremo Studios, Inc., in 2012. In February 2013, Marrs' \"Our Occulted History: Do the Global Elite Conceal Ancient Aliens?\" was published by HarperCollins. Marrs usually also held a book signing at Brave New Books in Austin, Texas at least once a year.\n\nMarrs's avocations included American Civil War reenactment, collecting Civil War memorabilia and researching the history of World War II. However, according to his wife, Carol, who met him on a blind date while they were students at the University of North Texas, \"[H]e was almost a pacifist. He didn't believe we should be in a war unless you were defending your home.\"\n\nIn March 2017, an announcement was made on Marrs' official Facebook page about an unspecified illness that caused him to cancel appearances at two upcoming events, the 5th annual Out of this World UFO Conference in Edinburg, Texas, and the Free Your Mind Conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, both in April.\n\nIn June 2017, additional announcements were made about health issues Marrs was experiencing, including being on kidney dialysis at home, and problems with his remaining good eye.\n\nMarrs died on August 2, 2017, from a heart attack at age 73.\n\n\n\n\nThough participating in a number of radio shows, it has become tradition for Marrs to be the guest of the season premier of Binnall of America Audio\n\n\n"}

M.\" Roberts (14 April 1928 – 30 May 2003) was a British historian, with significant published works. From 1979 to 1985 he was vice chancellor of the University of Southampton, and from 1985 to 1994, Warden of Merton College, Oxford. He was also well known as the author and presenter of the BBC TV series \"The Triumph of the West\" (1985).\n\nRoberts was born in Bath, the son of a department store worker and educated at Taunton School. He won a scholarship to Keble College, Oxford, and took a first in Modern History in 1948. After National Service, he was elected a prize fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, where he completed a doctoral thesis on the Italian republic set up during the time of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\n\"The Times Literary Supplement\" described Roberts as \"master of the broad brush-stroke\".\nIn 1953 Roberts was elected a fellow and tutor in Modern History at Merton College, Oxford, and in the same year went as a Commonwealth Fund fellow to Princeton and Yale, where his interests broadened beyond European history. He returned to America three times as a visiting professor in the 1960s. From 1979 to 1985 Roberts was vice-chancellor of the University of Southampton where he felt obliged to make unpopular cuts (Classics and Theology). In 1985 Roberts wrote and presented the thirteen-part BBC series \"The Triumph of the West\", and was later historical advisor to the series \"People's Century\". From 1985 to 1994 Roberts was Warden of Merton College, Oxford until his retirement, whereupon he returned to his native Somerset.\n\nIn 1996, Roberts was appointed CBE for his 'services to education and history' and made a Cavalier of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1991. \n\nRoberts died in 2003, at Roadwater, Somerset, shortly after completing the fourth revised edition of his \"The New History of the World\".\n\nThe John Roberts Memorial Fund was established in his honour at Merton College in 2003, with the aim of increasing the financial support available to undergraduate and graduate students. The college hoped that the first recipient would be a history graduate.\n\nWhen Roberts' \"The Mythology of the Secret Societies\" was republished in 2008, the back cover contained the following message: \"We are living at a time when conspiracy theories are rife and the notion of secret plans for world domination under the guise of religious cults or secret societies is perhaps considered more seriously than ever.\"\n\nOn 10 September 1960, at Milton Abbas, Roberts married (Mariabella) Rosalind Gardiner. The marriage was dissolved in 1964. At Oxford on 29 August 1964 Roberts married Judith Cecilia Mary Armitage, a schoolteacher, and they had one son and two daughters.\n\n\n"}

His father, Serafín Álvarez, was an exiled Republican Spaniard; within the family, discussions about society, politics and religion were common. He studied at the Faculty of Law in Buenos Aires, where the ruling class of the time was raised. His doctoral thesis was evaluated by Bartolomé Mitre.\n\nSince 1902, he worked at the Tribunals of Rosario, as a secretary, attorney, prosecutor and judge. He lived most of his life in this dynamic and rapidly growing city of the province of Santa Fe, and made friends within the professional and business elite, as well as firm links with other Argentine intellectuals. He was of a liberal mindset, opposed to nationalism and the tendency to worship tradition.\n\nHis first books argued that the roots of a nationality should not be sought in the old times, but in the future. This topic was especially relevant due to the wave of nationalistic pride sweeping Argentina near the centennial of its liberation from Spain (the May Revolution of 1810). In his \"Essay on the history of Santa Fe\" he went as far as claiming that Argentine history is nonexistent before 1853 (year of the framing of Constitution).\n\nIn 1913, Álvarez founded a public library in Rosario. This library, which is the largest in the city, carries at present the name of \"Biblioteca Argentina Dr. Juan Álvarez\".\n\nIn 1914, Álvarez wrote about the civil wars of Argentina from an economic point of view, and explicitly looking to prevent similar wars in the future. World War I and the Russian Revolution of 1917 affected his liberal mindset, which led him to write a criticism of liberalism and its limitations. Similar crises came after the Sáenz Peña Law of secret and compulsory suffrage and the conservative revolution of 1930. Álvarez turned towards conservatism, unsure about the new developments in the relationship between citizens, institutions and the state.\n\nIn 1943, he wrote \"Historia de Rosario (1689–1939)\" (\"History of Rosario\"), which, like other works that deal with the interaction of geography, economy and politics, is considered a seminal work, which introduces the concept of the city as a subject matter, starting from its local identity, without a forced reference to national matters. His thesis about the asymmetric relationships between his adopted home town, Rosario, and the capital city of Santa Fe, opposes the dynamism of the former (devoid of a colonial past or an aristocratic class) and the bureaucratic tradition of the latter. This idea is still considered valid and continues to re-emerge in popular and intellectual discourse today.\n\nÁlvarez was the Attorney General of the Nation between 1935 and 1946. He died in Rosario in 1954.\n\n"}

Ltd.. It is unknown if the company actually manufactured the game due to mass counterfeiting in China. \"Laden VS USA\" was also released in two different designs. The game is based on the 9/11 attacks and features pictures of the actual wreckage on the packaging. \"Laden VS USA\" also bears the marks of \"Made in China\" and \"Ages 5 and Up\" on the packaging.\n\n\"Laden VS USA\" has received negative reviews and is very controversial. The game has also been banned from two stores; one in Warrington, Cheshire, England and the other in Brooklyn, New York, United States.\n\nThe player controls a submarine travelling across the bottom of the screen shooting at fighter jets flying by. The game is divided into 20 levels and automatically levels you up to the next. When a level is completed the game plays a pinging version of \"Deck the Halls\". The higher the level, the more difficult the game becomes. \"Laden VS USA\" is based on the 9/11 incident in 2001 all superimposed over a 9/11 photograph. Although the game is about the 9/11 attacks, the instructions on the back of the packaging appear to have been lifted word for word from the blurb of a boxing game, and the gameplay is seemingly unrelated.\n\nThe game is supposedly manufactured by Chinese company Panyu Gaming Electronic Co. Ltd. located in Guangzhou, China. Panyu Gaming Electronic used technology almost two decades old when creating the game. Due to mass counterfeiting in China it is not certain whether the company actually created the game. The video game is the first to use the September 11 attacks as a main plot device. The game was released in two models, the first being GM-026A-3 and the second GM-028A-3. The first model can come with yellow or white buttons. The game was also released with pictures of actual 9/11 wreckage on the packaging and pictures of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden on the console. The packaging also bears the marks \"Made in China\" on the packaging, and is recommended for \"Ages 5 and Up\". Upon the game's release it was unrated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB).\n\n\"Laden VS USA\" is also an example of the growing political and cultural impact of video games. The game can be compared to other controversial video games such as \"Grand Theft Auto\" or \"Ghost Recon\". \"Laden VS USA\" also presents an unusual challenge to journalists, scholars and historians for its inherent value as classic war propaganda. \"Laden VS USA\" also provides an interesting example as a non-American cash in to contemporary conflicts, similar to the game \"Final Battle Afghanistan X-Tank\". The game is also notably very rare but can sometimes be found on eBay.\n\n\"Laden VS USA\" has become popular among Pakistani children. Despite this the game is very controversial and has even been banned from the shelves of a discount store in Warrington, Cheshire, England after several protests from religious leaders. Teenager Hannah Birchall stated about the incident, \"The images on the box bring back all the memories of September 11\", and that she thinks that \"it will desensitise children to what happened\". The game has also created controversy in the town of Brooklyn, Chelsea, USA where pedestrians were outraged over the presence of the game in the local store named Oakdale Dairy. YouTube toy reviewer Mike Mozart of JeepersMedia considered \"Laden VS USA\" \"the worst concept for a game in history\" and said that \"it boggles the mind that it was actually manufactured and sent to the United States\".\n"}

{"id": "10493336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10493336", "title": "Marcia Crosby", "text": "Marcia Crosby\n\nMarcia Crosby is Tsimshian-Haida writer, art historian, and educator from British Columbia.\n\nCrosby is of ancestry, originating from the Maxxtakxaata (Metlakatla, Alaska), and Gisbutwaada (Killer Whale clan), and House of Gitlan. Born and raised in her maternal grandmother's territory, Marcia grew up on what is now Prince Rupert. She has a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Arts and English (1990), a Master of Arts, \"Indian Art/Aboriginal Title\" in Cultural History (1993), and a Doctorate of Philosophy in Art History, all from the University of British Columbia. Her MA thesis focused on the tension between representations of Aboriginal cultures and peoples in the public sphere, the work of Indigenous art and artists, and representations of Aboriginal title in British Columbia. Crosby's PhD dissertation is on, ‘self-identifying modern Indian artists.’ Crosby started teaching English literature and First Nations Studies at Vancouver Island University in 1996 (previously Malaspina College). Crosby has worked as a researcher, reviewing Aboriginal programs in public institutions. Crosby's works in literature and curatorial practices have continually interrogated mainstream representations and the historical narratives of First Nations peoples and cultures.\n\nCrosby was a guest curator and writer for the Contemporary Art Gallery's exhibition \"Nations in Urban Landscape\" (1994). This exhibit toured to Oboro, Montreal in 1996. Shelly Niro, Faye HeavyShield and Eric Robertson are some of the artists referenced in her, \"Nations in Urban Landscape\" exhibition catalogue. In \"Nations in Urban Landscape\" Crosby investigates the geo-political discourse between Canadian and First Nations governments over the land issues that have shaped cultural practices in museums and galleries.\n\nStarting in 2008, Crosby began participating in the web project, \"Ruins in Progress: Vancouver Art in the Sixties\" in association with the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery. Included on this site is an essay by Crosby titled, \"Making Indian Art ‘Modern’\" where Crosby writes, \"What complicates any exploration of this historical stage is the situation in which artists and others struggled to become modern. Before the mid1960s, there was no sustained economic or/and institutional or private support from patrons (including collectors of contemporary aboriginal art), nor an established intellectual discourse to create value for ‘modern Indian’ art.\" Crosby writes about George Clutesi, Henry Speck, David Neel and others and their vision to be modern integrated artists during the sixties. Crosby explains that because of their art practices there was an invocation of upward social mobility which succeeded in integrating the formalist discourse of Northwest coast ‘fine art’ into both museum and art galleries, which paradoxically eclipsed many these early artists and their histories. Crosby's work for this website was the first step in framing her PhD dissertation. Since 2001, Crosby has written on contemporary art history topics as diverse as the myth of Bill Reid, the sculptural works of Dina Gomez, an Argentinian artist living and working in Vancouver, and aboriginal performance art, which included two published essays on the multi-media works of Rebecca Belmore.\n\nIn 2012, Crosby acted as a co-curated with Karen Duffek at the Vancouver Belkin and Satellite Gallery's show, \"The Paintings of Henry Speck: Udz’stalis.\" Henry Speck (1908-1971) is a kwakwaka’waka artist who became a \"newly discovered phenomenon\" in 1964, when his paintings of masked dancers, coastal creatures, and sea monsters were shown at Vancouver's New Design Gallery. Marcia Crosby is introduced in the exhibition excerpt as a writer, scholar, and PhD candidate, UBC Department of Art History, Visual Art, and Theory). In the exhibition catalogue \"Projections: The Paintings of Henry Speck, Udzi’stalis\" Karen Duffek, and Marcia Crosby have a formal dialogue where they discuss Specks place in \"Indian art\" history. Crosby states, \"I don’t think Speck and his work ‘slipped away’ so much as the genealogy of ‘modern art’ by Aboriginal artists cannot account for such qualities as their traditional, metaphysical referents, or their seemingly positivist focus on form.\"\n\nIn July 2013, Crosby held a \"Feedback\" talk for the Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver) in response to Itee Pootoogook's exhibit \"Buildings and Lands\". Pootogook's exhibition included a series of large-scale graphite and coloured pencil drawings depicting images of modern northern life distinctly different from the accustomed historical images seen in Inuit work. Instead of traditional subjects such as igloos and parka-clad hunters, Pootogook shows her audience everyday works, one made up of recognizable contemporary accouterments including snowmobiles, boats, soft drinks, and television sets. Crosby's formal discussion on the Pootogook's exhibit heavily reflected upon some of the aspects researched and developed in her PhD. Crosby writes in her thesis, \"Setting up cultural institution in the heroic position of saviors of First Nations cultures bypasses the more important issue of addressing how that ‘need’ was created in the first place. Certainly, it can be stated that many First Nations individuals and communities today recognize that accessing the information recorded by ethnographers, anthropologists, archeologists, political scientists, art historians and curators is very important to filling in the historical gaps in local knowledge- which exist because of the many colonialist projects for assimilation and cultural genocide...Who benefits from whom is a historically specific and complex question.\" Crosby’s Feedback at the Contemporary Art Gallery included a focus on the formation of Aboriginal cultural production in urban spaces in Vancouver, B.C., for Native and non-Native publics. More specifically, Crosby focuses on the diverse forms of performativity, the display and sale of Aboriginally produced objects, and urban community supports by well-known First Nations artists through their association with new Aboriginal social organizations.\n\nAn important work by Marcia Crosby is her \"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\" an essay included in Janet Giltrow book, \"Academic Reading, second edition: Reading and Writing Across the Disciplines.\" In the text, Crosby makes clear her goal to analyze the current state and recent phenomenon in the arts and social sciences where an embracing of ‘difference’ is taking place. Crosby makes transparent her experiences at university and the importance of the trials and tribulations she faced. She writes, \"At the time, I felt only the discomfort of being wedged between the limits of who my professor thought I was and what that person was capable of accomplishing. As I continued studying the Euro-Canadian interaction with First Nations people, both in the visual arts and in literature, I saw a composite, singular ‘Imaginary Indian’ who functioned as a peripheral but necessary component of Europeans’ history in North America- the negative space of the ‘positive’ force of colonialist hegemony.\" The ‘Imaginary Indian’ is a fictionalization of past and present cultures by the west and Crosby elaborates on this throughout her essay. Crosby shapes an argument focused on the precautions about western historizing indigenous people as illusory and an inscribing in past cultures a need to be saved through colonization and civilization. However, \"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\" does not take a primarily negative stance. In fact, Crosby writes about how the interest in aboriginal culture, in turn, created a space for native people to enter the art arena, which has in part provided a forum for many First Nations people to speak to current social and political issues. During her four years at university, Crosby studied and researched individuals who supposedly presented positive images of native people including: Paul Kane, Emily Carr, and Bill Reid.\n\nAs one of the less than one per cent of First Nations students who attend post-secondary institutions, Crosby found a collection of artists whose work prompted images of past cultures. Emily Carr and her retrospective at the National Gallery of Canada in the summer of 1990 is a major focus in \"Construction of the Imaginary Indian.\" Crosby points out that Carr paints the remaining traces of Indian culture such as totem poles and canoes. This artistic decision on Carr's behalf speaks to what Crosby interprets as an ambition to record others. In her text, Crosby questions this further by interrogating the subjects in Emily Carr's paintings. Crosby writes, \"Carr paid a tribute to the Indians she ‘loved’\" but who were they?\" \"The Construction of the Imaginary Indian\" argues Carr's paintings can be seen as a recording of relics or ethnographic depictions. In Crosby's eyes, Carr was searching for a Canadian identity and also recognition for acting honorably. Crosby writes, \"At this time, when the struggles of First Nations people for aboriginal rights and self-identity are being widely publicized, it is inappropriate, I think, for an art historian to describe Carr’s remarks as a ‘statement of high moral purpose.’\" Carr is not alone is being perceived by art historians this way, Paul Kane’s work and reception by the public is also unpacked in Crosby’s essay.\n\nIn \"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\" Crosby writes that Paul Kane’s texts and images reflect nineteenth-century philosophical, religious and political views about indigenous peoples. Crosby adds, Kane’s ‘historical documents’ have transcended time with a message that is still embraced by some art historians and government officials. However, Kane's work today can be read as a detriment of First Nations people because his work became a rationale for denying aboriginal rights, because according to Kane being Indian meant being a savage. Clearly, Crosby finds Kane's claims of authenticity problematic. Paul Kane was committed to making journals in the hopes that they would become intrinsic or essential in value for historians. Crosby states that when a culture is represented as going through fatal changes, the natural thing to do is salvage or save it. \"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\" sheds light on the fact that Kane's’ success depended on the inevitable death of a primitive people and industrial's fascination with such individuals. Bill Reid's work moves slightly away from acting like a recording or documenting, when compared to Kane's journals.\n\nBill Reid is introduced in Crosby's text as a central figure in this revival of Indian art. Crosby introduces Bill Reed as a Haida artist who took part in the so-called renaissance of Northwest Coast Indian art. Crosby writes, \"In this vein, others besides Reid have been cited as saviors of native culture.\" In \"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\" the media's response to marginalized cultures within the postwar context is made central. In reciprocation to the publicizing of the apparent hardships of a culture there is a general global cry for decolonization and independence for non-Western nations (280). Reid has stated he: \"wants to be taken on his own, engaged in the making of art, not Indian art.\" In her text, Crosby responds to this by commenting on political meaning behind his supposed autonomous art practice. Crosby writes, \"Reid has actively supported the myth of the imminent death of the Indian, by identifying himself as hero and cultural saviour.\" Reid's work follows a rubric that promotes the dominant culture's assumption that is not only their obligation but their right to assume the responsibility of caring for a dying culture, that within the museum setting, becomes a homogeneous collection of Indian artifacts. Crosby writes, \"The Indian was neatly contained within the institutional glass case, carefully locked away as a repository for the unthinkable or unspeakable parts of those who created it.\" Reid's work like Carr and Kane reinforces the myth of the artist while also underlining a culture's apparent helplessness.\n\nIt is important to note that in \"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\" Crosby includes a list of the individuals who have contributed to her conclusions on the ‘Imaginary Indian.’ Crosby writes, \"However, the critical and protesting voices of Linda Nochlin, Heather Dawkins, Edward Said, Terry Goldie, Trinh T. Minh-ha, Marnie Fleming, James Clifford, Virgina Dominguez and many others confirmed the legitimacy of my discomfort at the disparity between what was imagined, written or said, and what was implied In \"Manifest Matters\", Gerald Vizenor writes, \"The postindian warriors hover at last over the ruins of tribal representations and surmount the scriptures of manifest manners with new stories; these warriors counter the surveillance and literature of dominance with their own simulations of survivance.\" Crosby does more than ‘collect and display Indians as objects’ as human specimens rather her writing speaks to a personal experience and personal connection with past and present cultures with a sensitivity that is supported by dedicating years to building upon an education. Included in Wendy Stewart, Audrey Huntley and Fay Blaney's, \"The Implication of Restorative Justice for Aboriginal Women\"(2001) is a quotation by Marcia Crosby:\n\n\"I can hardly speak your words because I think you might not forgive me for telling the story you wanted kept a secret. Yes, some of out leaders, some of our old people and others on our communities want us to be quiet about life on our social and geographical reserves. They want us to be silent and if we are not we are not family. But your silence deadened me gram. This is about love and anger. This is about sadness and joy. About strength and total collapse of the spirit.\"\n\nThis quotation included in \"The Implication of Restorative Justice for Aboriginal Women\" is reinforcement for how dedicated Crosby is in making works that offers a spirit, honor and resistance.\n\n\n"}

(died 1278) also known as Martin of Poland, was a 13th-century Dominican friar, bishop and chronicler.\n\nKnown in Latin as \"Frater Martinus Ordinis Praedicatorum\" (Brother Martin of the Order of Preachers), he is believed to have been born, at an unknown date, in the Silesian town of Opava (German: Troppau), at that time part of the Margraviate of Moravia. Thus in German he appears as \"Martin von Troppau\" and in Czech as \"Martin z Opavy\".\n\nFrom the middle of the 13th century, Martin was active in Rome as confessor and chaplain for Pope Alexander IV and his successors, Pope Urban IV, Pope Clement IV, Pope Gregory, Pope Innocent V, Pope Adrian V and Pope John XXI (d. 1277), the last pope to appear in his chronicles. On 22 June 1278, Pope Nicholas III, while in Viterbo, appointed him Archbishop of Gniezno.\n\nWhile en route to his new episcopal see, Martin died in Bologna, where he was buried at the Basilica of St. Dominic, near the tomb of the founder of his Order.\n\nMartin's Latin chronicle, the \"Chronicon pontificum et imperatorum\", was intended for the school-room. It is mostly derivative in content and is therefore of limited value to modern historians. However, its importance is in the way the material is presented, which is a quantum leap forward in didactic method. The genius lies in its layout; each double page covers fifty years with fifty lines per page. The left-hand pages give the history of the papacy, with one line per year, and the right-hand pages give the history of emperors, the two accounts being kept strictly parallel. This was a revolutionary approach in graphic design, which was not appreciated by all his contemporaries: many manuscripts simply copy the text without retaining the page layout, which results in a rather chaotic chronology. The chronicle was enormously influential; over 400 manuscripts are known, and the influence on many dozens of later chroniclers is palpable. Translations were made into many medieval vernaculars, including Middle English, as well as an Old French translation by Sébastien Mamerot. Martin's \"Chronicon\" is the most influential source for the legend of \"Pope Joan\". Other of his works include the \"Promptuarium Exemplorum\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18761837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18761837", "title": "Mediology", "text": "Mediology\n\nMediology (French: \"médiologie\"), broadly indicates a wide-ranging method for the analysis of cultural transmission in society and across societies, a method which challenges the conventional idea that 'technology is not culture'. The mediological method pays specific attention to the role of organisations and technical innovations, and the ways in which these can ensure the potency of cultural transmission - and thus the transformation of ideas into a civilisational worldview capable of sustained action.\n\nThe term was first coined and introduced in French as \"médiologie\" by the French intellectual Régis Debray in the \"Teachers, Writers, Celebrities\" section of his book \"Le pouvoir intellectuel en France\", (Editions Ramsay, 1979). The English form of the term became more widely known and respected in the English-speaking world with the publication of the key text on mediology in English, Debray's \"Transmitting Culture\" (University of Columbia Press, 2004). Mediology was taught for the first time in the Sorbonne (Paris) in 2007.\n\nThe practice of mediology is not a science, and thus is able to range across academic disciplines. The main areas involved are those of longitudinal history (the history of technologies, the history of the book, the histories and theories of aesthetics) and also research in communications and information theory.\n\nMediology is not a narrow specialist area of contemporary academic knowledge (as media sociology is), nor does it aspire to be a precise science of signs (as semiotics does). It differs from the models put forward by communication studies, in that its focus is not isolated individuals and a fleeting few moments of communication. Instead mediologists study the cultural transmission of religions, ideologies, the arts and political ideas in society, and across societies, over a time period that is usually to be measured in months, decades or millennia. Debray argues that mediology \"would like to bring to light the function of medium in all its forms, over a long time span - since the birth of writing. And without becoming obsessed by today's media.\"\n\nMediology must thus closely examine the methods used for the memorising, transmission, and displacement of cultural knowledge in any milieu. But it must balance its understanding of these with an equally close study of our individual modes of belief, thoughts, and competing social organisations. Mediology must further understand that such transmission is not simply happening within a lofty linguistic or textual discourse, but that transmission takes an equally valid concrete form in which \"material technologies and symbolic forms\" combine to produce things such as rituals, architecture, flags, special sites, customs, typefaces and book bindings, smells and sounds, bodily gestures and postures, all of which have a potent anchoring role in cultural transmission among ordinary people.\n\nDebray further points to the need to consider the role in transmission of all manner of non-media technical-cultural inventions, especially those of new forms of transportation. He gives the historical example of the bicycle, which he suggests was historically associated with: the rise of a democratic rational individualism; a new role for women in advanced societies; and the new kinetic ideas expressed in early modernist art and cinema.\n\nA mediologist might thus make an examination \"within a system\" (e.g. of systems of book production, of authors and publishers), or of \"the interaction between systems\" (e.g. how painting and early photography influenced each other), or even of \"the interactions across systems\" (e.g. the ways in which symbolic transmission of systematic knowledge is brought to intersect with the material history of actual transportation - such as desert trading routes and ancient religion, telegraph and railroad, the radio and airplanes, television and satellites, mobile phones and cars).\n\nDebray is generally critical of some of the ideas of Marshall McLuhan (whom he sees as being overly technologically determinist), and of the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. He also tries to step beyond Antonio Gramsci, in that he suggests that an ideology cannot be comprehended in ideological terms alone.\n\nCriticisms of mediology in English so far have been found in two short book reviews and one article. The first, by the screenwriter Yvette Bíró (\"Wide Angle\" magazine, Vol.18, No.1, January 1996), was a four-page book review of Debray's \"Vie et Mort de l'Image\", in which she claimed to have discerned \"traces of a strong, vulgar Marxist school of thought\".\n\nThe second review, by Pramod Nayor of the University of Hyderabad (\"Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory\", Vol.8, No.1, Winter 2006) was a review of the English translation of \"Transmitting Culture\" (2004). In concluding the review Nayor notes the similarities of some aspects and directions of mediology to Birmingham School cultural studies ranging from \"Raymond Williams through Stuart Hall\". Nayor also notes that recent philosophers and historians of science - he cites Bruno Latour, Eugene Thacker and Dwight Atkinson - have also examined science in relation to \"intersecting cultural, ethnic, economic and iconographic 'bases' of the transmission of culture\"\n\nAn article by Steven Maris in \"Fibreculture\" No.12 similarly suggests that Debray is too firmly embedded in \"the French academic scene\" and that thus \"Debray's explicit engagement with other national scholarly traditions of media, communications and cultural studies in the works mentioned above is minimal\". Maris also notes that mediology \"predates much of the [current academic] interest in networked cultures and new media\".\n\nPhysicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont have criticized Debray's work for using Gödel's theorem as a metaphor without understanding its basic ideas, in their book \"Fashionable Nonsense\". Debray engaged in dialogue with Bricmont in a 2003 book titled \"À l'ombre des lumières : Débat entre un philosophe et un scientifique\", which so far has not been translated into English.\n\nDespite such criticisms, the six-volume \"New Dictionary of the History of Ideas\" (2004) wrote of Debray that \"His achievement is to have synthesized these earlier arguments into a practice with a powerful political project ahead of it.\" (Vol.4, page 1394).\n\n\n"}

She is a Professor of History and Women and Gender Studies at the University of Toronto and Director of the Technoscience Research Unit.\n\nMurphy is well known for her work on regimes of imperceptibility, the ways in which different forms of knowledge become visible or invisible in the scientific community and broader society. Murphy has published several books, including \"Sick Building Syndrome and the Problem of Uncertainty: Environmental Politics, Technoscience, and Women Workers\" (2006) which won the Ludwik Fleck Prize from the Society for Social Studies of Science, \"Seizing the Means of Reproduction: Entanglements of Feminism, Health, and Technoscience\" (2012), and \"The Economization of Life\" (2017).\n\nClaudette Michelle Murphy was born in 1969 and grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Her family background includes Metis and French heritage.\n\nMurphy was inspired by the work of feminists in science in the mid-eighties, including Donna Haraway and Ruth Hubbard. She earned a bachelor's degree in Biology and History and Philosophy of Science and Technology from the University of Toronto in 1992. She earned a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1998. Her experience at Harvard led her to incorporate analysis of whiteness explicitly into her work on science.\n\nIn the 1990s, Murphy worked with Evelyn Hammond and her working group on race and science at MIT. From 1996-2007, she edited RaceSci, a website on anti-racist studies in science, medicine, and technology. With Adele Clarke and others at the Society for the Social Studies of Science, she organized panels on race and science.\n\nMurphy is interested in asking the question \"What can feminist technoscience be?\" She studies the recent history of science and technology with particular attention to economics, capitalism, the environment, and reproduction, with an awareness of colonialism, feminism, gender, race, and queer theory.\n\nShe focuses on Canada, the United States, Bangladesh, and issues around chemical exposure, environmental justice, and reproductive justice. \"Landscapes of Exposure: Knowledge and Illness in Modern Environments\", which she co-edited with Gregg Mitman and Chris Sellers in 2004, has been called \"a foundational volume in bringing historical and social science perspectives to bear on the intersection of place and disease.\"\n\nMurphy is known for the concept of[regimes of imperceptibility, a framework for examining the ways in which different forms of knowledge become visible or invisible within scientific communities and society.\n\nShe develops these ideas in \"Sick Building Syndrome and the Problem of Uncertainty: Environmental Politics, Technoscience, and Women Workers\" (2006). She traces the history of sick building syndrome (SBS), a diagnosis applied to mass health complaints by office workers for which no cause can be identified. She closely examines the ways in which the identification of a new disease was affected by \"a congeries of unlikely forces\" including both scientific and social factors. The identification and acceptance of SBS, an inherently uncertain diagnosis, involves gender, race, and power dynamics within \"normal science.\" This raises the question \"How do we come to presence the effects of capitalism in our lives, and how are those effects invisibilized?\" She also looks at the presentation of information in ways that drew on traditions from the labor and feminist movements. The framework she introduces can be used by anthropological researchers for complex biopolitical analysis. She received the Ludwik Fleck Prize (2008) from the Society for Social Studies of Science for this book.\n\nMurphy is also the author of \"Seizing the Means of Reproduction: Entanglements of Feminism, Health, and Technoscience\" (2012). Her starting point is the work of radical feminists in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, who advocated for alternative health techniques and feminist clinics. She goes on to place these developments in a broader framework, examining relationships between feminism, imperialism, capitalism, population control, and neoliberalism. It is applauded for identifying critical junctures that were previously overlooked, and for its elegant examination of how the \"economy of reproduction\" operates in both developed and developing worlds. Murphy has said:\n\nMurphy continues to work on \"Distributed Reproduction,\" a theorization of reproduction that would extend beyond the individual.\n\nHer book \"The Economization of Life\" (2017) explores the 20th century rise of techniques to value life based on economic and biopolitical concerns. Murphy examines the techniques and epistemologies that have been used to describe and connect ideas of populations and economics in the United States and Bangladesh.\n\nMurphy is also working on \"Alterlife in the Ongoing Aftermaths of Industrial Chemicals,\" an examination of the transgenerational effects of environmental damage from industrial chemicals in the Great Lakes region.\n\n\n"}

A number of his latest books focus on World War II.\n\nHis international bestseller, \"Lisbon: War in the Shadows in the City of Light, 1939-1945\", recounts the pivotal role the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, played during World War II and how the small European country, guided by its authoritarian leader, António de Oliveira Salazar, survived the war not only physically intact but also significantly wealthier. The book is set within the context of a country that was frantically trying to hold on to its self-proclaimed wartime neutrality, but it was increasingly caught in the middle of the economic, and naval, wars between the Allies and the Axis.\n\nIn \"Brazil: The Fortunes of War, World War II and the Making of Modern Brazil\", Lochery reveals a long-buried chapter of World War II, showing how the cunning statecraft and economic opportunism of Brazil's leaders, under the dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas, transformed it into a regional superpower and uncovers the little-known origins of one of the world’s emerging economic powerhouses.\nIn 2013, he completed the first volume of a major work on the modern history of Portugal; \"Outside Looking In, 1933-1974\".

He expounded a circular view of world history.\n\nHe is remembered also for his opposition to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and for his theory of historical-cultural types.\n\nDanilevsky was born in the village of Oberets in Oryol Governorate. As a member of a noble family, he was educated at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. After graduation, he went on to an appointment with the Military Ministry Office. Dissatisfied with the prospect of a military career, he began to attend the University of St Petersburg, where he studied physics and mathematics.\n\nHaving passed his master's exams, Danilevsky prepared to defend his thesis on the flora of the Black Sea area of European Russia but in 1849 he was arrested there for his membership in the Petrashevsky Circle, which studied the work of French socialists and included Fyodor Dostoevsky. Its most active members were sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment. Danilevsky was imprisoned for 100 days in the Peter and Paul Fortress and then was sent to live under police surveillance in Vologda, where he worked in provincial administration.\n\nIn 1852, he was appointed to an expedition, led by Karl Ernst von Baer, to assess the condition of the fishing industry on the Volga and the Caspian Sea. The expedition lasted four years, and Danilevsky was then reassigned to the Agricultural Department of the State Property Ministry. For over 20 years, he was responsible for expeditions to the White Sea, the Black Sea, the Azov Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Arctic Ocean. The expertise that he gained from the expeditions led to the publication of his 1872 book, \"Examination of Fishery Conditions in Russia\".\n\nAside from his work on fisheries and the seal trade, he was the head of the commission setting the rules for the use of running water in Crimea from 1872 to 1879. He ran the Nikitsky Botanical Gardens from 1879 to 1880, and he was part of a commission appointed to deal with the phylloxera epidemic in the 1880s. His papers on Russian climatology, geology, geography, and ethnology earned him a gold medal from the Russian Geographical Society.\n\nDanilevsky died in Tbilisi, Tiflis Governorate, and was buried at his estate, in Mshanka.\n\nDanilevsky's \"Darwinism: Critical research,\" which brings together more than 1200 pages of arguments against Darwin's theory, mostly assembled from the literature that already existed at the time, was published in 1885. It was meant to be the first volume of a longer work, the second volume containing Danilevsky's own theories, which he characterised as \"natural theology\", but it was unfinished at his death. When it was published posthumously, it contained only preliminary studies.\n\nDanilevsky had been influenced by the work of von Baer, who had developed his own teleological theory of evolution and gone on to criticise Darwin's work in the 1870s. Danilevsky took from von Baer's theory the notion of \"Zielstrebigkeit\". The German word means \"singleness of purpose\" but Danilevsky imbued it with a religious aspect and argued that evolution, as well as the original creation of the world, has a rational purpose and follows the will of a divine creator.\n\nDanilevsky first published \"Russia and Europe: A Look at the Cultural and Political Relations of the Slavic World to the Romano-German World\" in the journal \"Zarya\" in 1869. Later republished as a monograph, it brought him international fame.\n\nHe pioneered the use of biological and morphological metaphors in the comparison of cultures. Danilevsky compared cultures and nations to biological species, denied their commonality and argued that each nation or civilisation is united by its language and culture, which it cannot pass on to any other nation. He thus characterised Peter the Great's reforms in Russia as doomed to failure, as they had attempted to impose alien values on the Slavic world.\n\nDanilevsky distinguished four categories of historical-cultural activity:\n\n\nThey gave rise to ten historical-cultural types:\n\n\nDanilevsky applied his teleological theory of evolution by stating that each type went through various predetermined stages of youth, adulthood, and old age, the last being the end of that type. He characterised the Slavic type as being at the youth stage, and he developed a socio-political plan for its development, involving unification of the Slavic world, with its future capital at Constantinople (now Istanbul), ruled by an Orthodox emperor. While other cultures would degenerate in their blind struggle for existence, the Slavic world should be viewed as a Messiah among them. Danilevsky, however, believed that there is no genuine or absolute progress, as history is circular.\n\nAspects of Danilevsky's book prefigured some of the theories in Oswald Spengler's \"The Decline of the West\". Arnold J. Toynbee mentions them in \"A Study of History\". The Danilevsky hypothesis became the subject of much controversy and polarised its readers. On one hand, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy praised it, but on the other hand, Occidentalists, such as Nikolai Kareev, Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943) and Nikolai Mikhailovsky (1842-1904), strongly opposed it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11224664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11224664", "title": "Oil sketch", "text": "Oil sketch\n\nAn Oil sketch or oil study is an artwork made primarily in oil paint in preparation for a larger, finished work. Originally these were created as preparatory studies or modelli, especially so as to gain approval for the design of a larger commissioned painting. They were also used as designs for specialists in other media, such as printmaking or tapestry, to follow. Later they were produced as independent works, often with no thought of being expanded into a full-size painting.\n\nThe usual medium for \"modelli\" was the drawing, but an oil sketch, even if done in a limited range of colours, could better suggest the tone of the projected work. It is also possible to more fully convey the flow and energy of a composition in paint. For a painter with exceptional technique, the production of an oil sketch may be as rapid as that of a drawing, and many practitioners had superb brush skills. In its rapidity of execution the oil sketch may be used not only to express movement and transient effects of light and color, its gestural nature may even represent a mimetic parallel to the action of the subject.\n\nOne of the earliest artists to produce oil sketches was Polidoro da Caravaggio, a fine draftsman and pupil of Raphael, but not one who had passed through the traditional Florentine training, with its emphasis on drawing. His are all apparently related to works later done on a larger scale, and are themselves relatively large and on panel, with examples in the National Gallery, London and Courtauld Institute of Art being 75 and 65 cm tall respectively. Sometimes a number of sketches for the same composition have survived.\n\nIn the early 17th century the oil sketch became widely used, as it was suited to conveying the drama of Baroque art. Rubens made great use of them, as working studies, and as \"modelli\" for clients, his own assistants, engravers and tapestry-makers. Their degree of finish varies accordingly. Rubens' working practices influenced others, such as Anthony van Dyck, who did not normally use oil sketches for the portraits that were the bulk of his output, but did for his print series the \"Iconographie\", and for other works such as a projected series of tapestries and some religious paintings. The \"Magistrate of Brussels\", recognised in England in 2013, may be a Van Dyck portrait oil sketch. \n\nPerhaps the first to produce oil sketches as independent works was Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, an amazingly fecund generator of compositions on a relatively small range of subjects. He grew up and trained in Genoa, and apparently had contact with both Rubens and Van Dyck during their stays there. He produced a large number of small works, mostly on paper, in a mixture of mediums - drawings or gouaches finished in oil, oils with pen details - in fact, most possible permutations. Detail is typically restricted to a few key points, with much of the subject conveyed in impressionistic fashion. By this time a collectors' market for studies in drawing was well developed, and there was appreciation of their energy and freedom. Castiglione's sketches to some extent seem to trade off this appreciation, and look more unfinished and offhand than they actually are - a concept with a great future. \n\nA systematic producer of small \"modelli\" sketches on canvas with a high degree of finish was the 18th century Venetian Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, whose superb technique is often shown at its best in reducing a huge altarpiece to a lively but precise rendering at this small scale. At roughly the same time Jean Fragonard was producing a series of virtuosic \"Figures de fantaisie\", half-length portraits of imaginary subjects, purporting to have been painted in an hour. \nBy the 19th century oil sketches, often referred to as \"oil studies\" if from this period, had become very common, both as preparatory works, and for their own sake. The popularity of the oil sketch engendered the need to formulate distinctions. The \"esquisse\", or oil sketch, tended to be inspirational or imaginative, often originating in literature or art; the \"etude\", or study, tended to represent an observation of nature, painted from life. In academic painting the oil sketch took the form of the \"croquis\", a small and gestural compositional study, and the \"ébauche\", a dynamic laying-in of paint on the full-scale canvas, a temporary stage of the painting eventually leading to greater elaboration. \n\nJohn Constable made extensive use of sketches for his landscapes, both of intimate scale, often in a sketchbook on paper, and in full-scale sketches for his largest \"six-footers\", which he used to refine his compositions. Delacroix, Géricault, Manet and Degas are other artists who often used them. For some oil sketches Degas painted in \"essence\", a technique by which the oil had been all but removed from the pigment, so that the artist was virtually drawing with pure paint. Seurat made many careful small oil sketches for his larger works. However, with the advent of Impressionism, and then Modernism, the practice of preparatory drawing and painting tended to decline. The abandonment by many artists of a high level of detail and finish in favor of a more painterly and spontaneous approach, reduced the distinction between a detailed sketch and a finished painting. Sketches by Rubens or Tiepolo, for example, are at least as highly finished as many 20th century oil paintings. Many artists, especially those working in more traditional styles, still use oil sketches today. Francis Bacon is an example of an artist who called many of his most important, and largest, finished works \"studies\": examples are his Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion Tate Britain, or his \"Study from Pope Innocent X\", auctioned in 2007 for $52.7 million.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "49693421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49693421", "title": "Pedro Llosas Badía", "text": "Pedro Llosas Badía\n\nPedro Llosas y Badía () (1870–1955) was a Spanish right-wing politician. Active in Catalonia, he was first associated with the Carlists and then with the Primo de Rivera regime. He was the longest-serving Carlist deputy from Catalonia during the Restauración but is known mostly as the civil governor of La Coruña and Baleares provinces during the dictatorship.\n\nThe Llosas family has traditionally been active in the Catalan textile industry as cotton weavers; in the 19th century they established themselves in middle-low range of the local bourgeoisie. Paternal grandfather of Pedro, Juan Llosas Pujol, originated from Olot (Girona province), located in the comarca of Alt Garrotxa at the Pyrenean foothills. His son and Pedro’s father, Juan Llosas Tenas (died 1872), in early years left his native region for Albacete, for over 20 years assisting his uncle in running a textile business. When the shop was inherited by his cousin, Albert Escubós Llosas, he returned to Olot and married Rosa Badía Trull (died 1896), a native of Sallent (Barcelona province). The couple possessed land properties in the neighboring Santa Pau and Mieres. Pedro was the only child of the couple.\n\nExcept that he was very early orphaned by his father, next to nothing is known about Pedro’s early childhood in Olot, a town that became a headquarters of Carlism during the Third Carlist War. In 1882 he entered the nearby Seminario-Colegio de Santa María del Collell, originally an ecclesiastic seminary in 1876 merged with Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza de Girona; the establishment allowed pursuing religious path but offered also commercial studies. In 1887 he obtained bachillerato, officially issued by Instituto de Girona, and enrolled at Facultad de Filosofía y Letras in the University of Barcelona. Llosas graduated in 1890, his dissertation dedicated to the Gracchus land reforms in the ancient Rome and acknowledged with excellent marks. He pursued scientific path later on, already when he served as deputy in Madrid; in 1915 he graduated in Madrid in history, his thesis titled \"Renaixement de Catalunya, època del rei Martí l'Humà\"; also later he remained particularly interested in archeology. One source refers to him as „abogado”.\n\nHaving returned to Olot in 1893 Llosas Badía married Anna Serat-Calvó y Plana (died 1942); they settled at calle de San Jerónimo 47. In 1895 he and two relatives founded a local bank, Banco Llosas, Escubós y Puigmitjà, which proved successful and remained their property until the mid-1920s. Pedro and Anna had 6 children, born between 1894 and 1904, but the family life was marked by recurring tragedies: María died in early infancy, Rosa - who married Joaquin Vayreda Aulet, son the Olot Traditionalist painter and author, Marian Vayreda - died at 23 in 1918, Nonito died also at 23 in 1921 and Juan died at 41 in 1933. Of the two surviving, Martirián Llosas y Serrat-Calvó - also a Carlist - was active in the Barcelona juvenile court, during early Francoism serving briefly as president of the Gerona diputacion and rising to president judge of Tribunal Tutelar de Menores de Barcelona and president of Union Nacional de Tribunales Tutelares de Menores, apart from having been president of Obra Tutelar Agraria for 27 years. Miguel Llosas y Serrat-Calvó pursued a law career and was also active as judge for the minors, but became a public figure mostly as a man of letters. Apart from lesser works on history and culture; his major study focusing on ancient Rome, \"Berenice\", was published posthumously.\n\nIn the late 19th century Olot was among Catalan Carlist strongholds. Painting activity of Escuela de Olot and literary works of Marian Vayreda y Vila made it cultural centre of regional Traditionalism and conservative Catalanism. The young Pedro – though nothing is known about political preferences of his ancestors – was growing exposed to both and actively engaged in both. In 1891 he was already reported as secretary of the local Centre Catalanista, 1892 growing to its vice-president; during his early years he also entered the local Circulo Tradicionalista, at unspecified date rising to its president. In the mid-1890s Llosas was also busy in local Olotense and regional Catalan Catholic initiatives. Apart from organizational work he was active as a speaker and especially as an author, contributing to periodicals like \"L’Olotí\" and \"El Deber\", though also \"Diario de Olot\" and \"El Ateneo\"; his writings revealed a knack for culture and history. Known locally, until the early 20th century Llosas did not emerge as a recognized figure in Catalan Carlism.\n\nIn 1897 Llosas was elected to the Olot ayuntamiento, becoming the third teniente de alcalde, president of Comisión de Gobernación and member of the other two. During the following term he grew to the first teniente de alcalde, president of Comisión de Fomento and vocal of the central, hospital and economy commissions, in 1900 briefly serving as alcalde. In 1903 Llosas presented his candidature to the ; he stood as a \"regionalista\". Elected from the Olot-Puigcerda district, he served as diputado until 1907. In the provincial self-government he represented a Traditionalist version of regionalism, declaring himself a Catalanist and anti-centralist; his opening address in the chamber was in Catalan, an extravaganza which earned him admonition by the president. As member of diputación he inspired and supported a new Olot Traditionalist periodical, \"La Tradició Catalana\". At that time he also published pamphlets formatted as discourses on political philosophy.\n\nIn mid-1900s Llosas decided to run for the Cortes. The Olot district voted Carlists in the late 19th century, but in the 1899-1907 it was conquered by La Lliga. The two competing groupings joined ranks in 1907, together with the Republicans forming . Though some solidaris accepted Llosas with difficulty, the strategy paid off; he was among seven Carlists voted in from Catalonia. The alliance soon disintegrated, but also in the following years La Lliga and the Carlists avoided fielding candidates in the same districts; as Olot was left to the Carlists, Llosas retained his mandate in successive campaigns of 1910, 1914 (when he ran as independent) and 1916 (declared victorious with no challenger), having been member of a small, depending upon term 6 to 14-member Carlist minority. His parliamentarian activity – vibrant especially during earlier terms - was marked mostly by defense of Catholic Church and by his modest Catalanism, culminating in confronting the government sponsored . He was counted among representatives of Catalan \"carlisme nou\"; in 1912 he entered the Carlist national executive.\n\nIn the late 1910s the Catalan Carlism was undergoing rapid fragmentation, marked by at least three not necessarily overlapping division lines: between supporters of the key party theorist Vázquez de Mella versus supporters of the claimant, between those approaching nascent Catalanism with sympathy versus those viewing it with caution, and between a faction favoring wide conservative alliances versus a faction sticking to stand-alone intransigence. Though a 1912 Carlist propaganda publication hailed his „acrisolada lealtad a los ideales Católico-Monárquicos”, Llosas was not immune to growing confusion.\n\nIn Girona the key division line was about the Catalan question. Llosas, unlike other key Carlist from the province Dalmacio Iglesias, tended to demonstrate more attraction for Catalanism than the official party executive would allow. In 1917 he took part in , a gathering of some 70 senators and deputies mostly from Catalonia. Called in the wake of growing social tension, the congregation declared the Restoration political system defunct and assumed a potentially revolutionary shape, pursuing also a highly regionalist model of state. Since the Carlists decided to abstain, Llosas joined the initiative on his own; some authors claim that he broke with the party, but others underline that proposals of the Assembly were later supported by the Carlists.\n\nThe 1918 electoral campaign produced total bewilderment. Despite Llosas’ taking part in the pro-Catalanist Assembly, La Lliga terminated the truce with the Carlists and fielded his counter-candidate in Olot. The Carlists themselves were divided into 3 factions led by , Iglesias and Llosas, the latter turned against La Lliga running as an ultra-Right anti-regionalist hopeful. Despite his differences with party executive, he was widely referred to as \"carlí\", \"jaumí\" or \"tradicionalista\". By a narrow margin he seemed to have lost to his Lliguero rival. He protested, pressing charges of corruption; investigations and backstage haggling continued until he was finally declared defeated. \n\nWhen the internal Carlist conflict between de Mella and Don Jaime exploded in 1919 Llosas seemed posed to join the rebels. In the Cortes under the influence of the former and sharing his penchant for grand conservative alliances, initially he tended to stand against the claimant. Eventually he declared himself neutral; indeed, after the breakup he was listed neither among the breakaway Mellistas nor the loyal Jaimistas. Instead, he neared the right wing of disintegrating Conservatives, the Mauristas; in the 1919 electoral campaign he unsuccessfully ran for the Senate as a governmental candidate, defeated for the upper chamber also in 1921 with only 16% of the votes gathered; some kept referring to him as \"jaimista\".\nLlosas’s affair with the Mauristas continued; in October 1921 Maura, prime minister at that time, appointed him of the Balearic Islands. Little is known about his tenure; according to present-day scholar, he demonstrated rather heavy hand and acted along \"lógica dins un sistema caciquista basat en la venjanca\", having been firm element of the structure. For reasons which are not clear he resigned from the governor post in April 1922 and returned to Olot.\n\nLlosas welcomed the 1923 coup of general Primo de Rivera and already in 1924 he was busy setting up provincial structures of nascent Unión Patriótica; he emerged heading the Olot branch, though he did not enter the provincial Girona executive. Also 1924 he was nominated to two Catalan self-government bodies, provincial and regional ones, normally elected but its members appointed under the new dictatorial regime. One was Diputación Provincial of Girona, whose members elected him president of the body. Another was Permanent Council of Mancomunitat de Catalunya; he briefly served as Conseller de Ferrocarrils i Obres Hidràuliques and member of Consell de Pedagogia, before becoming member of Consell de Cultura. At the latter post he shielded Institut d'Estudis Catalans from growing españolismo, advocated introduction of Catalan to schools and developed local libraries.\n\nIn 1924 the Girona diputación addressed Primo with a Llosas-inspired document, which opposed centralization designs of Catalan capitán and advanced a highly regionalist vision of state in general and Catalonia in particular. The paper proposed a province-centred organization of Catalonia modeled on the Vascongadas. It suggested that on the regional level Mancomunitat, itself deemed artificial, is replaced by a new body, Diputación Regional, its members delegated from provincial chambers, themselves elected on universal, corporative and municipal basis. However, the new potentially led to dissolution of regional bodies; anxious to retain some regional co-ordination, Llosas failed to convince other members of the Girona diputation, who effectively buried the idea of Mancomunitat. Acknowledging defeat Llosas resigned as head of Girona self-government. Nevertheless, he took part in works of Comissió Gestora entrusted with phasing out Mancomunitat until the body ceased to exist in 1925.\nDespite differences with the military, Llosas by no means could have been considered in opposition to Primo; his stance during tenure in Diputación Provincial and Mancomunitat should rather be viewed as efforts to find a compromise within framework of the regime. On good terms with the dictator, in May 1925 he was appointed civil governor of La Coruña province. Apart from standard administrative activities he again pursued a heavy-handed political line; aligned with the government, he cared little about the local opinion, though some refer to him as a pragmatist. Quoting health reasons and issuing an ambiguous farewell statement, he resigned in April 1926. The same year he was transferred to the parallel post in the Balearic Islands, commencing a second string in Palma. Little is known about his tenure. Press of the era provided only official information about cultural activities, diplomatic routine, construction of public utility establishments, propaganda, building new railway lines etc., though there were single complaints about his uncompromising stand recorded. Upon resignation of Primo in 1930 Llosas put himself at disposal of the new Berenguer government and was not re-appointed. He settled back in Olot, dedicating himself to family and business.\n\nLlosas enjoyed excellent financial standing; apart from family properties, he held managerial posts in the Olot branch of , the giant which took over Banco Llosas Escubós in the mid-1920s; he was referred to as \"banquer\", \"propietario\", \"comerciante\" and \"haciendista\". He basked in prestige of key Girona politician, a charismatic figure and local patricio, his house continuously visited by applicants seeking support. Llosas’ position changed dramatically upon advent of the Republic: as a former dictatorship tycoon, a monarchist and a Traditionalist reactionary he found himself politically sidetracked. A street in Santa Pau, named after him in 1930, was immediately renamed to Via de la República in 1931.\n\nLlosas focused on religious activity: in the early 1930s he took part in Catholic initiatives like Pro Ecclesia et Patria weeks, contributed to confessional periodicals and in 1933 led a large group of Catalans visiting Vatican. He resumed contacts with Carlism. During run-up to the 1933 electoral campaign he was initially reported as standing in candidatura de derecha agraría, neighboring with frontline Carlist activists like Urraca Pastor and defined as \"tradicionalista\"; eventually he declared the news not authorized. He kept supplying historical and religious articles to Traditionalist periodicals. In early 1936 Llosas together with other Catalan Carlists took part in broad monarchist gatherings led by Calvo Sotelo, though his relations with Carlism remained loose.\n\nLlosas welcomed the coup of July 1936 though there is no information on him having been involved. Following the outbreak of hostilities Olot was overtaken by Republican militias, who raided estates belonging to individuals deemed sympathetic towards the Right; according to one version the Llosas’ Mas Quintana mansion in Santa Pau was ransacked, with all movable items robbed and the immovable ones destroyed; according to another, it was expropriated in an orderly manner. Though his age did not save from execution, he survived the outburst of revolutionary zeal. None of the sources consulted provides information on his whereabouts during the Civil War. Immediately following Nationalist seizure of Catalonia, in February 1939 Llosas rushed to offer his services to the new Presidente de la Diputación, March 1939 entrusted with gathering trade and industry managers of Girona province to proceed with the post-war reconstruction. However, apart from the very early months of Francoism in Catalonia he was no longer reported as engaged in any official activities.\n\nThere is almost no information on Llosas’ public activity in the 1940s and later. Its key thread was engagement in numerous religious initiatives, reported as late as the early 1950s. Another was culture; apart from sporadic public appearances he was supplying historical pieces, usually related to religious topics, to the press, mostly to the Girona edition of \"\"; the periodical referred to him as \"respectable y querido amigo\". In 1947 he became a great-grandfather, but since 1949 he remained seriously disabled. His funeral was attended by president of Diputación Provincial, alcalde of Olot, leaders of provincial Movimiento and representatives of Carlism. His obituary in \"¡Arriba España!\" claimed he had always been a Traditionalist.\n\n\n\n"}

Prostitutes servicing members of the U.S. military in South Korea have been known locally under a variety of terms. Yankee princess (—also translated as Western princess) is a common name and literal meaning for the prostitutes in the \"Gijichon\", U.S. military Camp Towns in South Korea. Yankee whore ( \"Yanggalbo\") and Western whore are also common names. The women are also referred to as U.N. madams (, \"U.N. madam\"). Juicy girls is a common name for Filipina prostitutes. The term \"Western princess\" has been commonly used in the press, such as \"The Dong-a Ilbo\" for decades. On the other hand, it is also used as an insulting epithet.\n\nUntil the early 1990s, the term Wianbu (, \"Comfort Women\") was often used by South Korean media and officials to refer to prostitutes for the U.S. military, but comfort women was also the euphemism used for the sex slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army, and in order to avoid confusions, the term \"yanggongju\" replaced \"wianbu\" to refer to sexual laborers for the U.S. military. The early 1990s also saw the two women's rights movements diverge: on one side the one representing the Cheongsindae (Comfort women for the Japanese military), and on the other side the movement representing the Gijichon (Camptown for the US military), even if some women happen to have been victims of forced labor on both sides. Now some South Korean media use the term migun wianbu (, \"US military comfort women\"), literally \"American Comfort Women.\"\n\nIt is illegal for United States Forces Korea (USFK) service members to patronize prostitutes in Korea. Prostitution and the patronizing of a prostitute are crimes in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and are punishable under the USA's Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).\n\nAccording to United States Forces Korea's policy, \"Hiring prostitutes is incompatible with our military core values.\" In the Allied-occupied Korea, between 1950 and 2007, the total number of women amounted to over one million in all South Korea. Some women chose to become prostitutes. Prostitutes for U.S. soldiers were esteemed to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy by South Koreans, they were also lowest status within the hierarchy of prostitution.\n\nIn September 1945, United States Armed Forces occupied Korea, including Imperial Japanese comfort stations. The women in comfort stations were also taken over. In 1946, the United States Army Military Government in Korea outlawed prostitution in South Korea.\n\nUnder US Military rule, Korean society treated prostitutes with humiliation that included stoning and cursing from children. However, by 1953, the total number of prostitutes amounted to 350,000. Between the 1950s and 1960s, 60 percent of South Korean prostitutes worked near U.S. military camps. During the Korean War, it was the South Korean Army that controlled Wianbu units performing sexual services for United Nations and South Korean soldiers. Throughout the Korean War, two separate types of comfort stations were operated. One was \"U.N. Comfort Stations\" (, ) for UN peacekeeping units, and the other was \"Special Comfort Stations\" (, ) for soldiers of the Republic of Korea Army. U.N. Comfort Stations were administered in collaboration with provincial governors, mayors and police. The majority of women working in U.N. Comfort Stations were married and supporting their families. On the front lines, women were brought in by trucks without permission.\n\nThe Second Republic viewed prostitution as something of a necessity. In 1960, lawmakers of the National Assembly urged the South Korean government to train a supply of prostitutes for allied soldiers to prevent them from spending their dollars in Japan. Lee Seung-u, the deputy , gave a response to the National Assembly that the government had made some improvements in the \"Supply of Prostitutes\" for American soldiers.\n\nPark Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea during the 1960s and 1970s, and the father of the former president Park Geun-hye, encouraged the sex industry in order to generate revenue, particularly from the U.S. military. Park seized power in the May 16 coup, and immediately enforced two core laws. The first was the prostitution prevention law, which excluded \"camp towns\" from the governmental crackdown on prostitution; the second was the tourism promotion law, which designated camp towns as special tourism districts.\n\nDuring the 1960s, camp town prostitution and related businesses generated nearly 25 percent of the South Korean GNP. In 1962, 20,000 comfort women were registered. The prostitutes attended classes sponsored by their government in English and etiquette to help them sell more effectively. They were praised as \"dollar-earning patriots\" or \"true patriots\" by the South Korean government. In the 1970s one junior high school teacher told his students that \"The prostitutes who sell their bodies to the U.S. military are true patriots. Their dollars earned greatly contributes to our national economy. Don't talk behind their back that they are western princesses or U.N. madams.\"\n\nIn 1971, the number of American soldiers was reduced by 18,000, due to the Nixon Doctrine. Because of this, South Koreans were more afraid of the North Korean threat and its economic impact. Even so, camp town prostitution had already become an important component of South Korean livelihood. The advocacy group My Sister's Place wrote in 1991 that the American soldiers contributed one billion dollars to the South Korean economy which was 1% of the South Korean GNP.\n\nDespite this, there were issues of venereal disease and racist conflict. U.S. military personnel advised the South Korean government that the camp towns were breeding grounds for sexually transmitted infections and places of racist discrimination. The venereal disease ratio per 1,000 American soldiers rapidly increased, from 389 (in 1970), 553 (in 1971), and 692 (in 1972).\n\nCamp town clubs were separated for blacks and whites, and women were classified in accordance with the soldiers' race. The residents near Camp Humphreys discriminated between African Americans and white Americans. African American soldiers vented their anger against camp town residents. On July 9, 1971, 50 African American soldiers provoked a riot against racist discrimination and destroyed some clubs near Camp Humphreys. In turn, residents hunted down African American soldiers with sickles. American military police and South Korean police quelled the rioters.\n\nIn August 1971, the Secretary of , in cooperation with health authorities, gave orders to each police station to take precautions against sexually transmitted diseases and to instruct prostitutes about them. On December 22, 1971, Park Chung-hee, the President of South Korea, enforced the Base Community Clean-Up Campaign. The government educated women not to discriminate racially and banned clubs that posted segregationist signboards.\n\nThe US Military Police Corps and South Korean officials regularly raided prostitutes who were thought to be spreading disease, and would detain those thought to be ill, locking them up under guard in so-called \"monkey houses\" that had barred windows, and the women were forced to take medications that were reported to make them vomit. Women who were certified to be without disease wore tags. In the 1970s, U.S. military officials and South Korean bureaucrats discussed the matter of preventing epidemics and government efforts to register prostitutes and requiring them to carry medical certification. The US military issued and required the prostitutes who worked at clubs to carry venereal disease cards, and also published a venereal disease guide to inform American soldiers patronizing bars.\n\nThe South Korean government educated prostitutes who worked at the U.S. military camp in regard of preventing venereal disease. The South Korean bureaucrats educated that prostitution is an act of patriotism. The bureaucrats informed the prostitutes of their contribution to the development and security of South Korea when they serve the U.S. soldiers with a healthy and clean body along with cooperative attitudes. The former Chief Secretary of the Blue House who directed the Base Community Clean-up Campaign, educated the prostitutes to learn the spirit of prostitutes who served the U.S. military during 1945 in Japan. The former presidential secretary for audit and inspection, Hong Jong-chul, attempted to make policies for the prostitutes in base communities such as building apartments for them.\n\nThere are reports that some women were killed by soldiers or committed suicide.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, the prostitutes became a symbol of South Korean anti-American nationalism. In 1992, there were about 18,000 registered and 9,000 unregistered South Korean women around U.S. military bases.\n\nIn 1992, Yun Geum-i, a camptown sex worker in Dongducheon, was brutally killed by U.S. servicemen. Yun was found dead with a bottle stuffed into her vagina and an umbrella into her anus. In August 1993, the U.S. government compensated the victim's family with about US$72,000. However, the murder of a prostitute did not itself spark a national debate about the prerogatives of the U.S. forces; on the other hand, the rape of a twelve-year-old Okinawan school girl in 1995 by three American servicemen, one being a U.S. Navy Seaman, the others U.S. Marines elicited much public outrage and brought wider attention to military-related violence against women.\n\nSince the 2000s, the majority of prostitutes have been Philippine or Russian women; South Koreans have become less numerous. there is also evidence of women from the Philippines, China, and Kyrgyzstan being subjected to forced prostitution near U.S. military bases. Since the mid-1990s, foreigners make up 80–85 percent of the women working at clubs near military bases.\n\nOn the other hand, South Korean prostitutes are still represented in large numbers. According to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, South Korean prostitutes numbered about 330,000 in 2002. Most of these are not working near US bases, but operating on the local economy. In 2013, the Ministry estimated that about 500,000 women worked in the national sex industry. The Korean Feminist Association estimates the actual number may exceed one million. According to the estimates up to one-fifth of women between the ages of 15 and 29 have worked in the sex industry.\n\nThe South Korean government also admits sex trade accounts for as much as 4 percent of the annual gross domestic product. In August 1999, a Korean club owner in Dongducheon was accused of trafficking in women by bringing more than 1000 Philippine and Russian women into South Korea for U.S. military bases, but a South Korean judge overturned the warrant. In 2000, five foreign women locked in a brothel died in a fire in Gunsan.\n\nIn 2002, Fox Television reported casing brothels where trafficked women were allegedly forced to prostitute themselves to American soldiers. U.S. soldiers testified that the club or bar owners buy the women at auctions, therefore the women must earn large sums of money to recover their passports and freedom. In May 2002, U.S. lawmakers asked U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for an investigation that \"If U.S. soldiers are patrolling or frequenting these establishments, the military is in effect helping to line the pockets of human traffickers\".\n\nIn June 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense pledged to investigate the trafficking allegations. In 2003, the Seoul District Court ruled that three night club owners near Camp Casey must compensate all Filipina women who had been forced into prostitution. The club owners had taken their passports and had kept the women locked up. One Philippine woman who was in captivity kept a diary about her confinement, beating, abortion and starvation. Before the trial began, the International Organization for Migration studied the trafficking of foreign women and reported the result to its headquarters in Geneva. The Philippine Embassy also joined the proceedings, making it the first embassy to take steps on behalf of its nationals.\n\nIn 2002, the South Korean government completely discontinued issuing visas to Russian women, so prostitution businesses moved to bring in more Filipinas instead. Human traffickers also brought in Russian women through sham marriages. In 2005, Filipina and Russian women accounted for 90 percent of the prostitutes in U.S. military camp towns. In 2005, Hwang Sook-hyang, a club owner in Dongducheon, was sentenced to a 10-month suspended sentence and 160 hours of community service on charges of illegal brothel-keeping. The following civil trial sentenced him to compensate US$5,000 to a Philippine woman who was forced to have sex with U.S. soldiers between February 8 and March 3, 2004. The Philippine woman was recruited by a South Korean company in the Philippines as a nightclub singer in 2004, then she and several Philippine women were locked inside Hwang's club and forced to have sex with U.S. soldiers. The former \"juicy bar\" employees testified that soldiers usually paid US$150 to bring women from the bar to a hotel room for sex; the women received US$40. Most juicy bars have a quota system linked to drink purchases. Women who do not sell enough juice are forced into prostitution by their managers.\n\nIn 2004, the U.S. Defense Department proposed anti-prostitution. A U.S. serviceman at Camp Foster (located on Okinawa) told a \"Stars and Stripes\" reporter that although prostitution was illegal in the United States, in South Korea, Thailand and Australia, it was \"pretty open\". By 2009, the Philippine Embassy in South Korea had established a \"Watch List\" of bars where Philippine women were forced into prostitution and were considering sharing it with the U.S. military in hopes that U.S. commanders would put such establishments near bases off-limits to their troops.\n\nAs of 2009, some 3,000 to 4,000 women working as prostitutes came annually from Southeast Asia, accounting for 90% of the prostitutes. Despite prostitution being illegal in South Korea, camp towns were still practically exempted from crackdowns.\n\nIn 2010, the United States Department of State, reported the predicament of women who worked at bars near U.S. military bases as one of ongoing human trafficking concerns in South Korea. The Government of the Philippines stopped approving contracts that promoters used to bring Philippine women to South Korea to work near U.S. military bases.\n\nIn 2011, the Eighth Army founded the Prevention of Sexual Assault Task Force; the task force assessed and reported the climate in South Korea regarding sexual assault among U.S. soldiers.\n\nIn 2012, a United States Forces Korea public service announcement clarified, \"Right now, young women are being lured to Korea thinking they will become singers and dancers,\" and \"Instead, they will be sexually exploited in order to support their families.\" The United States Forces Korea posted a video on YouTube, clarifying that \"buying overpriced drinks in a juicy bar supports the human trafficking industry, a form of modern-day slavery.\" However, some U.S. commanders continue to allow American soldiers to patronize the bars as long as they have not been caught directly engaging in prostitution or human trafficking. Most recently, in June 2013, General Jan-Marc Jouas placed all juicy bars outside Osan Air Base off-limits for Seventh Air Force personnel. This change in policy resulted in three weeks of large scale protests in the local area, however, General Jouas credits this change in policy as resulting in most Juicy bars in the area closing down.\n\nOn June 25, 2014 122 surviving Korean comfort women for the U.S. forces filed a lawsuit against their government to reclaim human dignity and demand ₩10 million compensation per plaintiff. According to the claim, they were supervised by the U.S. forces and the South Korean government and South Korean authorities colluded with pimps in blocking them from leaving. In 2017, a three judge panel of the Central District Court in Seoul, ordered the government to pay 57 plaintiffs the equivalent of $4,240 each in compensation for physical and psychological damage.\n\nSince 2014, USFK has banned all USA military service members from visiting any establishments that allow patrons to buy drinks (or juice) for the hostesses for the purposes of their companionship. Hostess bars, juicy bars and anywhere that the company of female can be purchased are off-limits to American military. Since US military service members were a large source of the hostess bars clientele, this effectively closed all hostessing themed establishments nearby all US military bases in Korea.\n\nThe children born to American soldiers and South Korean prostitutes were often abandoned when soldiers returned to the U.S. By the 1970s, tens of thousands of children had been born to South Korean women and American soldiers. In South Korea, these children are often the target of racist vitriol and abuse, being called \"western princess bastards\" (\"Yanggongju-ssaekki\"), \"darkies\", or \"niggers\" (\"Kkamdungi\"). It was difficult for South Korean prostitutes around the U.S. military bases to escape from being stigmatized by their society, thus their only hope was to move to the United States and marry an American soldier. Trafficked Filipinas also had the same expectation.\n\nSome American soldiers paid off the women's debt to their owners to free them in order to marry them. However, most U.S. soldiers are unaware of the trafficking. Some soldiers have helped Philippine women escape from clubs. In 2009, juicy bar owners near Camp Casey who had political muscle, demanded that U.S. military officials do something to prevent G.I.s from wooing away their bar girls with promises of marriage. In June 2010, U.S. forces started a program to search for soldiers who had left and abandoned a wife or children. \"Haunting the Korean Diaspora: Shame, Secrecy, and the Forgotten War\", a research of prostitutes by Grace M. Cho who was the daughter of a G.I. and a South Korean woman, was awarded the best 2010 book on Asia and Asian America by the American Sociological Association.\n\nA former South Korean prostitute said to \"The New York Times\" that they have been the biggest sacrifice of the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and the Republic of Korea. The women also see themselves as war victims. They are seeking compensation and apologies. Because of this tainted history, the primary stereotype that most South Koreans held of South Korean women who had copulated with white men or \"crackers\" (\"Hindungi\") was mainly negative. Besides, the first transnational marriages were mostly between U.S. soldiers and Korean women who worked in U.S. military bases or who were camp prostitutes. By 2010, more than 100,000 Korean women had married U.S. soldiers and moved to the United States. South Korean women married to foreigners are often viewed as prostitutes. Marriages between South Koreans and foreigners often carry a serious stigma in South Korean society. A woman who is married to a Spaniard, said that almost 100% of middle-aged South Korean men look her up and down when she walks hand in hand with her husband.\n\n\"The Evil Night\" (1952) and \"A Flower in Hell\" (1958) by Shin Sang-ok depict South Korean prostitutes. \"Silver Stallion\" (1991) by Chang Kil-su depicts one prostitute symbolizing the raped nation of Korea. \"Spring in My Hometown\" (1998) by Lee Kwang-mo depicts one prostitute waiting for her American lover who never returns. \"Address Unknown\" by Kim Ki-duk depicts the lover of a prostitute who never returns to South Korea.\nThe VR Film \"Bloodless\" (2017) by Gina Kim is based on the true story of a South Korean prostitute,Yun Keum Yi, brutally murdered by a US soldier in 1992.\n\nThe play \"Seven Neighborhoods Like Warm Sisters\" depicts prostitutes living near Camp Humphreys.\n\nSong Byung-soo depicts prostitutes in \"Shorty Kim\" (1957). \"A Stray Bullet\" by Yu Hyun-mok depicts one woman who becomes a prostitute to rescue her family. Lee Moon-yul is depicted in \"What Crashes, Has Wings\" (1988).\n\n\"Camp Arirang\" is a 1995 documentary that claims one million females had been involved in prostitution up until 1995.\n\nUntil the early 1990s, the term Prostitutes (comfort women) was used to include people who were prostitutes to soldiers. Today, there is a debate about whether it is appropriate to express comfort women as comfort women by saying comfort women as a means of forced mobilization to the state.\n\n\n"}

Strand was destroyed in the Burchardi flood of 1634 with its remnants forming the islands Pellworm and Nordstrand which are now part of Germany. Strand Frisian is counted among the mainland group of North Frisian dialects.\n\nThe Frisian language became extinct on Nordstrand in the 17th century while it was spoken on Pellworm until the 18th century. After the 1634 flood, refugees from Strand brought their dialect to Wyk auf Föhr where it was spoken until the 19th century. Like the now extinct Wyk dialect, the Halligen Frisian can be seen as a continuation of the former Strand Frisian.\n\nThe most notable piece of literature in Strand Frisian is a translation of Martin Luther's \"Small Catechism\" from the time before 1634. Other works include the \"Yn Miren-Söngh\" [A Morning Song] and \"Yn Een-Söngh\" [An Evening Song] by preacher Anton Heimreich (1626–1685) from Nordstrand. Knudt Andreas Frerks (1815–1899), a pastor from Wyk, wrote a translation of the Parable of the Prodigal Son in the Wyk North Frisian dialect.\n\n"}

A three-period division of time appears in the Babylonian Talmud: the period before the giving of the law (\"Torah\"); the period subject to the law; and the period of the Messiah. This scheme was later adapted to Christian use, with three periods corresponding to the persons of the Trinity. In that form it was taken up by Joachim of Fiore; it had been held in a similar form a little earlier by the Amalricians.\n\nAfter the Protestant Reformation the scheme of the \"prophecy of Elias\" was popularised by Philip Melanchthon and his Lutheran collaborators, using \"Carion's Chronicle\" as a vehicle, heavily edited into due form. The three periods were 'without the law', 'under law', and 'under grace'. With each period attributed a length of two millennia, the scheme was applied to predict the end of time (or at least the commencement of a final seventh millennium). This was done by Johann Heinrich Alsted in the 17th century. The scheme was widely influential in its tripartite structure, seen also in the chronology of Achilles Pirmin Gasser.\n\n"}

It is mainly used on stone tools, and is sometimes referred to as \"traceological analysis\" (from the neologism \"traceology\").\n\nIn studying the wear on a lithics, different techniques are often used. A distinction is often made between use-wear and microwear analysis. Use-wear uses an approach of low magnification study while micro-wear employs high magnification; this raises contentions as to which approach is more useful. Therefore, use-wear studies regularly employ magnification up to 50x, while magnification beyond 50x is relegated to microwear analysis. In addition to the two groups of magnification in which researchers align themselves, a third group examines evidence of use by attempting to identify organic residues present on a lithic. The organic residues are analyzed in order to understand the activities the lithics were used for such as butchering, or other tasks which can leave behind traces of working with wood, ceramics, or plant remains.\n\nTool edge damage and polish are two major sources for information about the use of a tool. Variations of polish type are formed depending on how a tool edge is used functionally, on the type(s) of material, and duration of use.\n\nThe type of edge damage also varies among different tools. But a distinction is necessary between the intended use, what the tool maker designed the tool for, and actual use. This is an important distinction to note as tools can be used for more than its intended function or designed for several purposes. An often noted example from modern culture are screwdrivers which are designed for driving screws but are regularly used to open cans of paint. This type of multi-purpose tool is noted in lithic assemblages by ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological studies. Basic edge damage types include step fractures, snap fractures, micro-flake scars, and edge rounding. Fractures are differentiated by looking at both fracture initiation and propagation. Fracture initiation is defined as where and how the fracture of an edge begins. Fracture propagation is defined by the path a crack follows, and the degree of the crack’s growth. Fractures are often used to note how tools are created but also used in wear studies. For example, fracturing can help note whether a tool was used in an outward bending action rather than a downward force which can cause a flake to detach and create damage. In addition to flake scars, abrasion, edge rounding, and striations occurring after tool use, one must be careful to note whether this was from actual use or from handling after excavation/collection. Alterations to a tool’s edge or surface can result from improper handling or storage. For example, two artifacts within the same bag can cause wear marks from constant interaction, also the bags themselves have been noted to cause wear on artifacts.\n\nExperimental archaeology can be employed to test hypotheses on tool function by replicating different activities with freshly made tools. The reliability of experimental archaeology as an information source for use-wear analysis has been tested through multiple blind tests. These tests judge the ability to identify tool motion and contact material. One study done at the University of California Davis found that tool action was correctly identified 84 percent of the time, while tool material was correctly identified 74 percent of the time.\n\nThe reliability of experimental archaeology has made it a popular method for analyzing use-wear.The reliability of experimental archaeology has made it a popular method for assisting in the analysis of use-wear. With a microscope and proper training, use-wear analysis can be a useful resource. Although experimental analysis of use-wear may be used for its relatively cheap price, it can be a time consuming endeavor. This may require flint-knapping a tool comparable to the artifact under analysis, which can be long process dependent on personal ability, or buying such a tool. Also, the replication of tool use requires comparable source material (for tool creation) as well as access to the material the tool was used on. Additionally, the experiments must last an acceptable amount of time; slicing an object once will not suffice and requires countless attempts per tool and per material used upon. One example notes how Méry conducted use-wear analysis and experimental archaeology to examine 7 flint blades from a pottery workshop of Nausharo site in Pakistan, which reveals that these blades were used to trim clay on a turning wheel.\n\n"}

Wang Kangle worked as a designer in the Images Department of the Shanghai Commercial Press from 1924 to 1932. He later studied landscape painting under the guidance of Zhang Daqian, Huang Binhong and Zheng Wuchang. Throughout the prime of his life, he contented himself with consulting jade manufacturers and teaching art as the Communist Revolution strongly frowned upon prominent artists.\n\nAfter the Revolution, he traveled across China and began to develop the style that he is known for today. In 1952, he began to lecture at the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House and the Shanghai Fine Arts College. He held solo exhibitions in Hong Kong, Singapore and New York. He served as a member of Shanghai Research Institute of Culture and History, member of Shanghai Artists' Association, advisor to Huang BinHong Research Society, vice-chairman of Calligraphy and Painting Society of Shanghai and Hong Kong DeFeng Studio.\n\nToday, his artworks can be found in Wang Kangle Art Museum (王康乐艺术馆) located in City of Ningbo, Zhejiang province at the Xikou Yan Creek River. The 王康乐艺术馆 covers a total area of 12,000 square meters, building area of 3000 square meters. Ground was broken in 1996, the entire project totals and investment of more than 400 million yuan of which Mr. Wang Kangle invested 650,000 yuan and 300 pieces of his fine art. Today, the venue serves exhibition, creative, artistic research, as well as hospitality functions.\n\n"}

Freuler and Harry E. Aitken for the purpose of mass-producing and distributing Western films to movie theaters throughout the American midwest. One of over 100 such \"exchanges,\" Western Film proved to be more successful than most, opening branch offices in several midwestern cities, including Chicago, St. Louis, and Joplin, Missouri. Exchanges would negotiate with film studios for the rights to a completed film production, and would distribute the product to nickelodeon movie theaters.\n\nThis business model came to an end in 1908 when the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC; commonly known as the Edison Trust) sued independent film studios on grounds of patent infringement. Most studios did not have the means to stand against the Trust and were forced out of operation. With fewer films being produced, Freuler and Aitken were soon faced with financial difficulties. In order to keep Western Film afloat, they formed a succession of independent studios expressly for the purpose of keeping Western Film supplied with new pictures. The first of these studios was the American Film Manufacturing Company, founded in 1910, which was soon joined by Majestic Film. Both Western Film and its various affiliated studios were targeted by the MPPC to little avail: so successful were Freuler and Aitken's ventures that, in 1912, they partnered with the Shallenberger brothers (Wilbert E. and William Edgar), Crawford Livingston, and Charles J. Hite to found a new company, Mutual Film Corporation, which eventually came to replace the Western Film Exchange.\n\n"}
