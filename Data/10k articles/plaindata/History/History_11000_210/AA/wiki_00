In authorship he is usually abbreviated as A.T.I.\n\nHe was born on 18 December 1833 at Tain, Ross and Cromarty. His father was Alexander Innes, an accountant and bank agent, and his mother, Martha Taylor. He was educated at the Royal Academy in Tain and from 1848 to 1852 at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MA. Taylor Innes entered the legal profession although he originally intended to study theology and become a minister. His scruples about accepting the Westminster Confession of Faith prevented him from doing so although he remained within the Free Church communion. He contributed to articles on a religious theme to various journals, and his interest in the legal aspects of church creeds and traditions led to the publication of his pioneering work, \"The Law of Creeds in Scotland\", in 1867. He corresponded with W. E. Gladstone on the subject of the disestablishment of the Scottish Church and visited him in May 1868. He also wrote a scholarly paper called \"Gladstone in Transition\" in which he defended Gladstone's views, and for which he received the latter's appreciation. In 1881, Taylor Innes was appointed Advocate Depute under Gladstone's second government (1880–1885) and was reappointed under the subsequent Gladstone (1892–94) and Rosebery (1894–95) governments. In later life he withdrew from active legal practice to concentrate on ecclesiastical issues, where perhaps his historical significance lies.\n\nIn 1880, he married Sophia Dingwall Fordyce, daughter of Alexander D. Fordyce, a landowner and Liberal MP. She died less than a year later.\n\nIn 1906 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

{"id": "27363873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27363873", "title": "Arab Investigation Centres", "text": "Arab Investigation Centres\n\nArab Investigation Centres were torture centres established by the British administration during the 1936-1939 Great Arab Revolt in Mandate Palestine.\n\nThe Centres were established on the authority of Sir Charles Tegart, a senior police officer ‘headhunted’ from British India. Victims were waterboarded and generally given the ‘third degree’ until they ‘spilled the beans’. One such centre in a Jewish quarter of West Jerusalem was closed only after colonial official Edward Keith-Roach, the governor of Jerusalem, complained to the High Commissioner. Keith-Roach argued that ‘questionable practises ’ were counter-productive both in terms of the information gathered and the effect on local people's confidence in the police.\nThe Anglican Archdeacon in Palestine believed police abuses were the cause of the violence rather than a response to it. He detailed the daily complaints from Arabs of beatings at the hands of rampaging police officers in a letter to the Mandate Chief Secretary in 1936. An Anglican chaplain in Haifa also wrote to the Lord Bishop in Jerusalem, Graham Brown, in December 1937 about an incident he witnessed in which a suspect whose teeth were already knocked out before he was brought into the station was given another brutal beating:\nA second man came in who was in plain clothes, but whom I took to be one of the British Police, and I saw him put a severe double arm lock on the man from behind, and then beat him about the head and body in what I can only describe as a brutal and callous way. Once or twice he stopped and turned to the other people in the station, and in an irresponsible and gloating manner said \"I'm so sorry\"—\"I'm awfully sorry.\" And then proceeded to punch the prisoner round the station again. A third man came in. He was in plain clothes, and was wearing a soft felt hat. He was, I think, British, and may have been a member of the Police Force, but I thought at the time that he was a soldier in civilian clothes ... But this man also made a vicious and violent attack on the prisoner, and punched him about the head and body ... I am gravely disturbed at the possibility that one of the men who was in the station, and who beat up the first person who was brought in was not a member of the police force, but a soldier—this was the man who was wearing a soft felt trilby hat ... I was for two years Chaplain to a prison in England, and in the course of my duties not infrequently witnessed the methods which police and prison warders were compelled to use with men detained or serving long terms of imprisonment, and can only say what I saw on this occasion sickened me and filled me with the gravest misgivings.\nPalestinians themselves also made complaints to the authorities. There are accounts in Arabic of suspects being tortured, being beaten until they were unable to walk, being blown to bits, being left in open cages in the sun without sustenance, being beaten with wet ropes, ‘boxed’ and having their teeth smashed, of having their feet burnt with oil and of ‘needles’ being used on suspects and of dogs being set upon Arab detainees. British and Jewish auxiliary forces maltreated Arabs by having them hold heavy stones and then beating them when they dropped them. Guards also used bayonets on sleep-deprived men and made them wear bells around their necks and then dance.\n\nArab prisoners jumped to their deaths from high windows to escape their captors, had their testicles tied with cord, were tortured with strips of wood with nails in, had wire tightened around their big toes, hair was torn from their faces and heads, special instruments were used to extract fingernails, red hot skewers were used on detainees, prisoners were sodomised, boiling oil and intoxicants were used on prisoners, as were electric shocks, and water was funnelled into suspects’ stomachs. There were also mock executions.\n\nDespite protests and revulsion expressed even by British officials and Anglican clergy extrajudicial executions, torture, beatings and general violence remained commonplace responses by the police during the Arab revolt.\n\n"}

He did not know about the murder by gas, repeating the common belief at the time that deported Jews were being exterminated with electricity. Karski met with Polish government-in-exile, including the Prime Minister, Władysław Sikorski, as well as with members of political parties such as the Socialist Party, National Party, Labor Party, People's Party, Jewish Labour Bund and Poalei Zion. He also spoke to Anthony Eden, the British Foreign Secretary, and included a detailed statement on what he had seen in Warsaw and in Bełżec. In 1943 in London he met the author and journalist Arthur Koestler. He then traveled to the United States and reported to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. FDR reacted to Karski's report by inquiring jokingly into animal rights abuses (specifically, horses). His report was a major factor in informing the West.\n\nKarski met also with many other government and civic leaders in the United States, including Felix Frankfurter, Cordell Hull, William Joseph Donovan, and Stephen Wise. Karski presented his report to media, to bishops of various denominations (including Cardinal Samuel Stritch), to members of the Hollywood film industry and artists, but without success. Many of those he spoke to did not believe him, or judged his testimony much exaggerated or saw it as propaganda from the Polish government in exile.\n\nIn 1942 members of Polish government in exile published an official Polish protest against systematic murders of Polish and Jewish population in occupied Poland, based on the \"Jan Karski report\" and titled \"The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland\". The Poles addressed their protest to the 26 Allies who had signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942. In response, the Allied Powers issued on December 17, 1942 an official statement titled Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations Against Extermination of the Jews. The statement was read to the British House of Commons in a floor speech by Foreign secretary Anthony Eden, and published on the front page of \"The New York Times\" and by many other newspapers.\n\nIn 1942 Szmul Zygielbojm, a Jewish-Polish socialist politician, leader of the General Jewish Labor Bund in Poland, and member of the National Council of the Polish government in exile, wrote in English a booklet titled \"Stop Them Now. German Mass Murder of Jews in Poland\", with a foreword by Lord Wedgwood.\n\nFrom April 19, 1943, through April 30, 1943, during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 19 April to 16 May, representatives of the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States held an international conference at Hamilton, Bermuda. They discussed the question of Jewish refugees who had been liberated by Allied forces and of those who still remained in Nazi-occupied Europe. The only agreement made was that the war against the Nazis must be won. The US did not raise its immigration quotas and the British prohibition on Jewish refugees seeking refuge in the British Mandate of Palestine remained in place. A week later, the American Zionist Committee for a Jewish Army ran an advertisement in \"The New York Times\" condemning the United States efforts at Bermuda as a mockery of past promises to the Jewish people and of Jewish suffering under German Nazi occupation. Szmul Zygielbojm, a member of the Jewish advisory body to the Polish government-in-exile, committed suicide in protest.\n\nFrom April 1942 to February 1943, British Intelligence intercepted and decoded radio messages sent by the \"German Order Police\", which included daily prisoner returns and death tolls for ten concentration camps, including Auschwitz.\n\nThe United States Office of Strategic Services (the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and which had been established in 1941–1942 to coordinate intelligence and espionage activities in enemy territory) received reports about Auschwitz during 1942.\n\nAt the beginning of Operation Reinhard, the principal source of intelligence for the Western Allies about the existence of Auschwitz was the Witold's Report, forwarded via the Polish resistance to the British government in London. It was written by the Polish Army Captain Witold Pilecki who spent a total of 945 days at the camp – the only known person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz. He forwarded his report about the camp to Polish resistance headquarters in Warsaw through the underground network known as Związek Organizacji Wojskowej which he organized inside Auschwitz. Pilecki hoped that either the Allies would drop weapons for the Armia Krajowa (AK) to organize an assault on the camp from the outside, or bring in the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade troops to liberate it. A spectacular escape took place on 20 June 1942, when Kazimierz Piechowski (prisoner no. 918) organized a daring passing through the camp's gate along with three friends and co-conspirators, Stanisław Gustaw Jaster, Józef Lempart and Eugeniusz Bendera. The escapees were dressed in stolen uniforms as members of the SS-Totenkopfverbände, fully armed and in an SS staff car. They drove out the main gate in a stolen Steyr 220 with a smuggled first report from Witold Pilecki to Polish resistance. The Germans never recaptured any of them. By 1943 however, Pilecki realized that no rescue plans existed in the West. He escaped from the camp on the night of April 26–27, 1943.\n\nThe first written accounts of Auschwitz concentration camp were published in 1940/41 in the Polish underground newspapers \"Polska żyje\" (\"Poland lives\") and \"Biuletyn Informacyjny\" From 1942 members of the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Warsaw Area Home Army also began to publish short booklets based on the experiences of escapees. The first was the fictional \"Auschwitz. Memories of a prisoner\" written by Halina Krahelska and published in April 1942 in Warsaw The second publication was also produced in 1942 in the PPS WRN book \"Obóz śmierci\" (\"Camp of death\") written by Natalia Zarembina. In the summer of 1942 a book about Auschwitz titled \"W piekle\" (\"In Hell\") was written by the Polish writer, social activist and founder of Żegota, Zofia Kossak-Szczucka\n\nPolish reports about Auschwitz were also published in English versions. A booklet titled Zarembina was translated into English and published by the Polish Labor Group in New York in March 1944 with the title \"Oswiecim, Camp of Death (Underground Report)\" with a foreword by Florence Jaffray Harriman. In this report from 1942, the gassing of prisoners was described.\n\nAuschwitz site plans, originating from the Polish government, were passed on to the British Foreign Office on 18 August 1944.\nWładysław Bartoszewski, himself a former Auschwitz inmate (camp number 4427), said in a speech: \"The Polish resistance movement kept informing and alerting the free world to the situation. In the last quarter of 1942, thanks to the Polish emissary Jan Karski and his mission, and also by other means, the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States were well informed about what was going on in Auschwitz-Birkenau.\" \n\nOn April 7, 1944, two young Jewish inmates, Rudolf Vrba and Alfréd Wetzler, had escaped from the Auschwitz camp with detailed information about the camp's geography, the gas chambers, and the numbers being killed. The information, later called the Vrba-Wetzler report, is believed to have reached the Jewish community in Budapest by April 27. Roswell McClelland, the U.S. War Refugee Board representative in Switzerland, is known to have received a copy by mid-June, and sent it to the board's executive director on June 16, according to Raul Hilberg. Information based on the report was broadcast on June 15 by the BBC and on June 20 by \"The New York Times\". The full report was first published on November 25, 1944, by the U.S. War Refugee Board, the same day that the last 13 prisoners, all women, were killed in Auschwitz (the women were \"unmittelbar getötet\"—killed immediately—leaving open whether they were gassed or otherwise killed).\n\nAuschwitz was first overflown by an Allied reconnaissance aircraft on April 4, 1944, in a mission to photograph the synthetic oil plant at Monowitz forced labor camp (Auschwitz III).\n\nOn 26 June, 71 B-17 heavy bombers on another bombing run had flown above or close to three railway lines to Auschwitz.\n\nOn July 7, shortly after the U.S. War Department refused requests from Jewish leaders to bomb the railway lines leading to the camps, a force of 452 Fifteenth Air Force bombers flew along and across the five deportation railway lines on their way to bomb Blechhammer oil refineries nearby.\n\nBuna-Werke, the I.G. Farben industrial complex located adjacent to the Monowitz forced labor camp (Auschwitz III) located from the Auschwitz I camp was bombed four times, starting at 20 August 1944 until 26 December 1944. On December 26, 1944, the U.S. 455th Bomb Group bombed Monowitz and targets near Birkenau (Auschwitz II); an SS military hospital was hit and five SS personnel were killed.\n\nThe Auschwitz complex was photographed accidentally several times during missions aimed at nearby military targets. However, the photo-analysts knew nothing of Auschwitz, and the political and military hierarchy didn't know that photos of Auschwitz existed. For this reason, the photos played no part in the decision whether or not to bomb Auschwitz. Photo-interpretation expert Dino Brugioni believes that analysts could have easily identified the important buildings in the complex if they had been asked to look.\n\nSince the controversy began in the 1970s, a number of military experts have looked at the problems involved in bombing Auschwitz and the rail lines and have concluded that it would have been extremely difficult and risky and that the chances of achieving significant results would have been small.\n\nA 2004 documentary, \"Auschwitz; the forgotten evidence\" included interviews with historians William Rubinstein and Richard Overy. It mentioned the Jewish Agency's request to the Allies on 6 July to bomb Auschwitz and showed the aerial reconnaissance photographs. It then examined the operational and technical feasibility aspects, in two categories: precision bombing by Mosquito-type aircraft, and area bombing by larger aircraft. It considered that precision bombing of railway lines was so common by 1944 that the Germans had specialist teams that could repair damage within hours or days. The inmates' food supplies were assumed to come by rail, and so an unrepaired railway would cause them hardship. Area bombing risked killing too many prisoners.\n\nFrom March 1944 onwards, the Allies were in control of the skies over Europe. According to historian David Wyman the 15th U.S. Army Air Force, which was based in Italy, had the range and capability to strike Auschwitz from early May 1944. General Ira C. Eaker, the American Mediterranean Allied Air Forces Commander, whose airplanes were already bombing nearby Auschwitz, in July 1944 visited the Air Ministry in London. When the request to bomb Auschwitz was put to Churchill, he gave it his full support. He regarded it as something that the American daylight bombers could and should do.\n\nOn August 24, 1944, the U.S. Army Air Forces carried out a bombing operation against a factory adjacent to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Despite perfect weather conditions, 315 prisoners were killed, 525 seriously harmed, and 900 lightly wounded.\n\nThe first proposal to bomb Auschwitz was made on 16 May 1944 by a Slovak rabbi, Michael Dov Weissmandl, a leader in an underground Slovak organization known as the Working Group to the Jewish Agency. According to Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer, Weissmandl's proposal is the basis of subsequent proposals. At about the same time, two officials of the Jewish Agency in Palestine separately made similar suggestions. Yitzhak Gruenbaum made his to the U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem, Lowell C. Pinkerton, and Moshe Shertok made his to George Hall, the British under secretary of state for foreign affairs. However, the idea was promptly squashed by the Executive Board of the Jewish Agency. On 11 June 1944, the Executive of the Jewish Agency considered the proposal, with David Ben Gurion in the chair, and it specifically opposed the bombing of Auschwitz. Ben Gurion summed up the results of the discussion: \"The view of the board is that we should not ask the Allies to bomb places where there are Jews.\" \n\nIn the meantime, George Mantello distributed the Auschwitz Protocols (including the Vrba–Wetzler report) and triggered a significant grass roots protest in Switzerland, including Sunday masses, street protests and the Swiss Press Campaign. On 19 June 1944 the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem received the reports summary. David Ben Gurion and the Jewish Agency had reversed its opposition immediately upon learning that Auschwitz was indeed a death camp, and urged U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to bomb the camp and the train tracks leading to the camp.\n\nShortly thereafter, Benjamin Akzin, a junior official on the War Refugee Board staff made a similar recommendation. It was put in writing in an inter-office memorandum dated June 29 to his superior, a senior staff member, Lawrence S. Lesser. These recommendations were totally rejected by leading Jewish organizations. On June 28, Lesser met with A. Leon Kubowitzki, the head of the Rescue Department of the World Jewish Congress, who flatly opposed the idea. On July 1, Kubowitzki followed up with a letter to War Refugee Board Director John W. Pehle, recalling his conversation with Lesser and stating:\n\nThe destruction of the death installations can not be done by bombing from the air, as the first victims would be the Jews who are gathered in these camps, and such a bombing would be a welcome pretext for the Germans to assert that their Jewish victims have been massacred not by their killers, but by the Allied bombers.\n\nIn June 1944, John Pehle of the War Refugee Board and Benjamin Akzin, a Zionist activist in America, urged the United States Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy to bomb the camps. McCloy told his assistant to \"kill\" the request, as the United States Army Air Forces had decided in February 1944 not to bomb anything \"for the purposes of rescuing victims of enemy oppression\", but to concentrate on military targets. However, Rubinstein says that Akzin was not involved in discussions between Pehle and McCloy, and that Pehle specifically told McCloy that he was transmitting an idea proposed by others, that he had \"several doubts about the matter,\" and that he was not \"at this point at least, requesting the War Department to take any action on this proposal other than to appropriately explore it.\"\n\nOn August 2, General Carl Andrew Spaatz, commander of the United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe, expressed sympathy for the idea of bombing Auschwitz. Several times thereafter, in the summer and early autumn of 1944, the War Refugee Board relayed to the War Department suggestions by others that Auschwitz and/or the rail lines could be bombed. It repeatedly noted that it was not endorsing anything. On October 4, 1944, the War Department sent (and only this time) a rescue-oriented bombing proposal to General Spaatz in England for consideration. Although Spaatz's officers had read Mann's message reporting acceleration of extermination activities in the camps in Poland, they could perceive no advantage to the victims in smashing the killing machinery, and decided not to bomb Auschwitz. Nor did they seem to understand, despite Mann's statement that \"the Germans are increasing their extermination activities,\" that wholesale massacres had already been perpetrated.\n\nFinally, on November 8, 1944, having half-heartedly changed sides, Pehle ordered McCloy to bomb the camp. He said it could help some of the inmates to escape and would be good for the \"morale of underground groups.\" According to Kai Bird, Nahum Goldmann apparently also changed his mind. Sometime in the autumn of 1944, Goldmann went to see McCloy in his Pentagon office and personally raised the bombing issue with him. However, by November 1944, Auschwitz was more or less completely shut down.\n\nThe British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, did not see bombing as a solution, given that bombers were inaccurate and would also kill prisoners on the ground. The land war would have to be won first. Bombers were used against German cities and to carpet-bomb the front lines. According to Martin Gilbert, Churchill pushed for bombing. Concerning the concentration camps, he wrote to his Foreign Secretary on July 11, 1944: \"...all concerned in this crime who may fall into our hands, including the people who only obeyed orders by carrying out these butcheries, should be put to death...\" The British Air Ministry was asked to examine the feasibility of bombing the camps and decided not to for \"operational reasons,\" which were not specified in wartime. In August 1944, 60 tons of supplies were flown to assist the uprising in Warsaw and, considering the dropping accuracy at that time, were to be dropped \"into the south-west quarter of Warsaw.\" For various reasons, only seven aircraft reached the city.\n\nMichael Berenbaum has argued that it is not only a historical question, but \"a moral question emblematic of the Allied response to the plight of the Jews during the Holocaust.\" David Wyman has asked: \"How could it be that the governments of the two great Western democracies knew that a place existed where 2,000 helpless human beings could be killed every 30 minutes, knew that such killings actually did occur over and over again, and yet did not feel driven to search for some way to wipe such a scourge from the earth?\" Kevin Mahoney, in an analysis of three requests submitted to the allies to bombard railway lines leading to Auschwitz, concludes that: \n\nWilliam Rubenstein, in \"The Myth of Rescue\", mentions that the debate did not start until 1967: \"For the first twenty years or so after the end of the Second World War, probably no historical work on the Holocaust criticized the actions of the Allies or suggested that much more could have been done which was not done.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated at City of London School, University College London, and Magdalen College, Oxford (Zoology 1896-99, Honorary Fellow 1953). Trained in zoology and medicine, he qualified for medical practice in 1903. He was appointed medical officer on an expedition led by Sir John Harrington to the border region between Abyssinia and Sudan on the same day his medical qualification was announced. He returned to England and took a position at Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, and in 1907 left for Singapore. Forced to return to England on his father's death in 1908, he held positions at various hospitals in London until he moved to Oxford in 1914 to work with Sir William Osler (first Baronet), then Regius Professor of Medicine at the university.\n\nSinger was married in July 1910 to Dorothea Waley Cohen, distinguished in her own right as an historian of the Medieval period.

The Singers spent time in Berkeley where Charles spent three months as a visiting lecturer at the University of California, after which they returned home to London. He was invited again by the University of California at Berkeley to lecture in 1932, an occasion that the Singers used to circle the globe going westward, spending about sixteen months away from England. On their return, Singer resumed his post at UCL, where he remained until his retirement in 1942. His last great publication before retirement was \"A Short History of Scientific Ideas to 1900\".\n\nSinger was one of the two contributors to the revised and updated version for Encyclopædia Britannica of the bulk of Thomas Clifford Allbutt's article \"Medicine\" which had been in the 11th edition. As revised for the 14th edition Singer's part was \"Medicine, History of\" (in volume 15), which followed after Sir Humphry Rolleston's \"Medicine, General\".\n\nRetirement was not idle for the Singers. Charles continued research into various topics and published several noteworthy books, including editing the monumental \"A History of Technology\", which was released in five volumes between 1954 and 1958, \"Galen on Anatomical Procedures\", and \"A History of Biology\". Numerous articles were also published in this period, some of which remain important. He died in Par, Cornwall.\n\nCharles Singer's life was complemented by numerous awards, honors, and positions of leadership. Among these were an honorary degree (D.Sc.) from Oxford, and terms of presidency of several societies, including the British Society for the History of Science (1946-1948) and the International Union for the History of Science (1947). He was also a member of the International Society for the History of Medicine. He and his wife were co-awarded the Sarton Medal from the History of Science Society in 1956.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3465606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3465606", "title": "Chronicle of Fredegar", "text": "Chronicle of Fredegar\n\nThe Chronicle of Fredegar is the conventional title used for a 7th-century Frankish chronicle that was probably written in Burgundy. The author is unknown and the attribution to Fredegar dates only from the 16th century.\n\nThe chronicle begins with the creation of the world and ends in AD 642. There are also a few references to events up to 658. Some copies of the manuscript contain an abridged version of the chronicle up to the date of 642, but include additional sections written under the Carolingian dynasty that end with the death of Pepin the Short in 768. The \"Chronicle of Fredegar\" with its \"Continuations\" is one of the few sources that provide information on the Merovingian dynasty for the period after 591 when Gregory of Tours' the \"Decem Libri Historiarum\" finishes.\n\nNone of the surviving manuscripts specify the name of the author. The name \"Fredegar\" (modern French Frédégaire) was first used for the chronicle in 1579 by Claude Fauchet in his \"Recueil des antiquitez gauloises et françoises\". The question of who wrote this work has been much debated, although the historian J. M. Wallace-Hadrill admits that \"Fredegar\" is a genuine, if unusual, Frankish name. The Vulgar Latin of this work confirms that the Chronicle was written in Gaul; beyond this, little is certain about the origin of this work. As a result, there are several theories about the authorship:\n\n\nFredegar is usually assumed to have been a Burgundian from the region of Avenches because of his knowledge of the alternate name Wifflisburg for this locality, a name only then coming into usage. This assumption is supported by the fact that he had access to the annals of many Burgundian churches. He also had access to court documents and could apparently interview Lombard, Visigoth, and Slavic ambassadors. His awareness of events in the Byzantine world is also usually explained by the proximity of Burgundy to Byzantine Italy.\n\nThe chronicle exists in over thirty manuscripts, which both Krusch and the English medievalist Roger Collins group into five classes. The original chronicle is lost, but it exists in an uncial copy made in 715 by a Burgundian monk named Lucerius. This copy, the sole exemplar of a class 1 manuscript, is in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (MS Latin 10910) and is sometimes called the \"Codex Claromontanus\" because it was once owned by the Collège de Clermont in Paris. A diplomatic edition was prepared by the French historian Gabriel Monod and published in 1885. The \"Codex Claromontanus\" was also the basis of the critical edition by Krusch published in 1888 and of the partial English translation by Wallace-Hadrill published in 1960. Most of the other surviving manuscripts were copied in Austrasia and date from the early ninth century or later.\n\nThe first printed version, the \"editio princeps\", was published in Basel by Flacius Illyricus in 1568. He used MS Heidelberg University Palat. Lat. 864 as his text. The next published edition was \"Antiquae Lectiones\" by Canisius at Ingolstadt in 1602.\n\nThe manuscript was made available on the World Digital Library on December 20, 2017\n\nIn the critical edition by Krusch the chronicle is divided into four sections or books. The first three books are based on earlier works and cover the period from the beginning of the world up to 584; the fourth book continues up to 642 and foreshadows events occurring between 655 and 660. In the prologue the author (traditionally Fredegar) writes:\n\nI have most carefully read the chronicles of St Jerome, Hydatius and a certain wise man, of Isidore as well as of Gregory, from the beginning of the world to the declining years of Guntram's reign; and I have reproduced successively in this little book, in suitable languages and without many omissions, what these learned men have recounted at length in their five chronicles.\n\nIn fact, Fredegar quotes from sources that he does not acknowledge and drastically condenses some of those he does. He also inserts additional sections of text that are not derived from his main sources. These inserted sections are referred to as \"interpolations\". For most of them the sources are not known. Some of the interpolations are used to weave a legend of a Trojan origin for the Franks through the chronicle.\n\nThe initial 24 chapters of the first book are based on the anonymous \"Liber generationis\" which in turn is derived from the work of Hippolytus. The remainder of the book contains a compendium of various chronological tables including a list of the Roman Emperors, a list of Judaic kings, a list of popes up to the accession of Theodore I in 642 and Chapter 3 of the chronicle of Isidore of Seville. On the reverse of the folio containing the papal list is an ink drawing showing two people which according to Monod probably represent Eusebius and Jerome.\n\nThe first 49 chapters of the second book contain extracts from Jerome's Latin translation of the Chronicle of Eusebius. The text includes some interpolations. The remaining chapters contains extracts from the Chronicle of Hydatius.\n\nThe third book contains excerpts from Books II–VI of the \"Decem Libri Historiarum\" by Gregory of Tours with several interpolations. Fredegar's source appears to have lacked the last four books of Gregory's text and his narrative ends in 584.\n\nThe 90 chapters in the fourth book contain details of events concerning the Burgundian court. Fredegar does not reveal his sources but the earlier chapters are presumably based on local annals. Chapters 24–39 contain an accounts from witnesses of events between 603 and 613. Chapter 36 is an interpolation on the life of Saint Columbanus that is copied, almost without change, from the \"Vita Columbani\" by Jonas of Bobbio. The book ends abruptly in 642. Book IV has been the most studied by historians as it contains information that is not present in other medieval sources.\n\nOne group of manuscripts (Krusch's Class 4) contain a reworking of the \"Chronicle of Fredegar\" followed by additional sections that describe events in Francia up to 768. These additional sections are referred to as the \"Continuations\". Krusch in his critical edition, appends these extra chapters to the text of the \"Codex Claromontanus\" creating the false impression that the two parts originate from the same manuscript.\n\nClass 4 manuscripts are divided into three books. The first begins with a section based on the treatise \"De cursu temporum\" by the obscure fourth century Latin writer Quintus Julius Hilarianus. This is followed by a version of Fredegar's Book II incorporating an expanded account of the Trojan origin of the Franks. The second book is an abridged version of the histories by Gregory of Tours corresponding to Fredegar's Book III. The third and final book consists of the 90 chapters of Fredegar's Book IV followed by the \"Continuations\".\n\nThe \"Continuations\" consists of three part. The first ten chapters are based on the \"Liber Historiae Francorum\", an anonymous Neustrian chronicle that ends in around 721. The second part (Chapters 11–33) covers the years up to 751. At this point a colophon is inserted in the text explaining that the writing of the chronicle was ordered by Charles Martel's brother, Count Childebrand. Wallace-Hadrill's translation is:\nThe chronicle then continues for another twenty chapters covering events in Francia up to the year 768.\n\nThe medievalist Roger Collins has argued that the text in the Class 4 manuscripts is sufficiently different from the \"Fredegar Chronicle\" of the \"Codex Claromontanus\" that it should be considered a separate work. He has proposed the new title \"Historia vel Gesta Francorum\" which occurs in the colophon mentioned above. He has suggested that one author was responsible for the text up 751, and that a different author probably wrote the additional chapters.\n\n\n\n"}

She is considered to be a \"major figure in the development of American Indian Studies programs.\"\n\nKidwell was born in Tahlequah, Oklahoma in 1941. Kidwell grew up in Muskogee, Oklahoma and she was named for her two grandmothers, with whom she had a very close relationship as a child. Her paternal grandmother helped raise her while her parents worked as clerks at the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Kidwell attributes her focus on attention to detail to her childhood experiences learning from her parents to keep copies of everything and how to pay close attention to grammar from a high school teacher, Glady Nunn. In 1959 Kidwell graduated from Central High School and went on to attend the University of Oklahoma (OU). Kidwell received her bachelor's degree in 1963. While she was an undergraduate, she made the College Bowl Team which led to her receiving a fellowship in the history of science after she graduated with her bachelor's degree. She earned her master's in 1966 from OU. She finally received her Ph.D from the University of Oklahoma in 1970.\n\nKidwell began to teach American Indian studies in 1970 at Haskell Indian Junior College (now Haskell Indian Nations University). She worked at Haskell for two years until she left to be an associate professor at the University of California at Berkeley where she worked until 1993. At Berkeley, her \"research and publication flourished\" and she received fellowships from the Newberry Library and the Smithsonian Institution. In 1980, she was a visiting scholar and associate professor at Dartmouth College. After Berkeley, she took her career in a new direction as the assistant director for cultural resources at the National Museum of the American Indian. She helped move one million different pieces from the George Gustav Heye's Museum of the American Indian from New York to Washington, D.C. In 1995, she chose a tenured position at the University of Oklahoma as the director of the Native American studies program. She contributed the piece \"Native Americans: Restoring the Power of Thought Woman\" to the 2003 anthology \"\", edited by Robin Morgan.\n\nIn 2007, Kidwell started the American Indian Center (AIC) at the University of North Carolina (UNC). One of her major goals at AIC was to reach out to the many eastern tribes such as the Lumbee and Coharie who are unable to qualify for federal recognition with the Bureau of Indian Affairs for various reasons. Under Kidwell's leadership, AIC has had success in North Carolina increasing programs that address education, health and child welfare for these kinds of unrecognized tribes. She has also helped increase the \"visibility of Native history and culture on campus.\" Kidwell retired from her position as director of AIC in June 2011.\n\n\n"}

He is a specialist in international criminal law, the Holocaust, the history of the Romani people in Eastern Europe and Russia, and 20th century China. He has served as an expert witness in many court cases in the United States and Canada, and testified before the U.S. Congress’ Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the New York City Council’s Committee on Immigration. His numerous books have been translated into six languages.\n\nCrowe began his career as a Russian specialist at the National Archives of the United States in 1974 where he worked with Soviet officials who were seeking the return of Russian embassy and consular records seized by the U.S. after the Bolsheviks took power in late 1917. The following year he joined a special team of archivists in the Department of Defense that worked with the U.S. Senate’s Church Committee investigation of the U.S. intelligence community. This group also handled new Freedom of Information Act and other requests related to the Vietnam War and other topics. Crowe returned to the National Archives in early 1977 as liaison to the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nLater that year, Crowe accepted a teaching position at Elon University where he taught the history of the Holocaust, Nazi Germany, and modern Chinese history. In 2006, he was appointed Professor of Legal History at Elon’s School of Law where he taught courses on international criminal law and international criminal tribunals. Crowe also taught at Central European University in Budapest, Hungary and has lectured at the University of Heidelberg, Germany; the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland; and the University of Bucharest, Romania.\n\nCrowe was a Visiting Scholar at the Harriman Institute at Columbia University from 1998 to 2001, and a Fellow at the Center for Slavic, Eurasian, and East European Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1997 to 2006. He was President of the Association for the Study of Nationalities from 1998 to 2004, and a member of the Education Committee of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum from 1990 to 2004. He was also a member of the North Carolina Council on the Holocaust and served as its chair from 1995 to 1999.\n\nHe has been a consultant to many national and international organizations dealing with programs designed to expand awareness of human rights issues, educational reform, and public awareness of such issues in Central and Eastern Europe. This included work with the United States Agency for International Development of the Rule of Law/Global Rights Initiative, Central European University’s Research Scheme in Prague, the Open Society Institute’s Roma Cultural Initiative, and the DiploFoundation’s Roma Diplomacy Project.\n\nOver the past 20 years, Crowe has served as an expert witness in numerous cases in the United States, Canada, and Israel dealing principally with asylum and extradition issues. He also organized the Conference on International Law: War Crimes, Human Rights, and Immigration at Elon University’s School of Law in 2012, and served as a judge for Elon's Billings, Exum & Frye National Moot Court Competition in 2012 and 2013. He took part in the Silberman Seminar for Law School Professors, \"The Impact and Legacy of the Holocaust on the Law\", at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. from June 4–15, 2007.\n\nOver the years, Crowe has been the recipient or co-recipient of grants from the American Council of Learned Societies, the U.S. Department of Education, the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and Elon University. In 2009, he was awarded Elon University’s first Senior Faculty full year research sabbatical, and three years later its two-year Senior Faculty Research Fellowship.\n\nIn 1994 the Association for the Advancement of Baltic Studies awarded Crowe it's V. Stanley Vardys President's Prize for Books on Baltic Studies for his \"The Baltic States and the Great Powers: Foreign Relations, 1938-1940\". In 2000, he was the recipient of Elon University’s first Distinguished Scholar’s Award, and in 2013 the Elon College of Arts & Sciences Distinguished Scholar’s Award. In 2010 he received the Southern Conference on Slavic Studies’ Richard Stites Senior Scholar Award for Contributions to the Field of Slavic Studies.\n\nCrowe’s books have dealt with a variety of subjects ranging from the evolution of international criminal law, the history of national and international criminal tribunals, the Holocaust, 19th and 20th century China, international relations in Central and Eastern Europe, and the history of the Roma in Eastern Europe and Russia.\n\nHis principal works have been well-received. Romeo Dallaire wrote that Crowe did “an exceptional job of research and writing on the crime of genocide and war crimes” in his \"War Crimes, Genocide, and Justice: A Global History\" (2014). It is written, he went on, “with the skill of the academic, the experience of the practitioner, but in the language of the layman.” Samuel Moyn added that it “provides an encyclopedic summation both of humanity’s propensity for atrocious evil and of its halting and inadequate search for accountability after the fact.\n\n\"\" selected Crowe’s \"The Holocaust: Roots, History, and Aftermath\" (2008) as an Outstanding Academic Title for 2008, while former US Holocaust Memorial Museum director Michael Berenbaum wrote that it was a “detailed work that never gets lost in its detail” which “offers precision yet never loses sight of the larger story that must be told and retold.”\nElie Wiesel told \"The New York Times\" that Crowe’s biography of Oskar Schindler, the Righteous Gentile made famous in Steven Spielberg’s \"Schindler’s List\", added complexity to the film without “’even altering the story.’” The result, he continued, was that \"Oskar Schindler: The Untold Story of His Life, Wartime Activities, and the True Story Behind the List\" (2004; 2007), “’made Schindler more human, and also more extraordinary.’” \"Oskar Schindler\" was later chosen as a selection of the History Book Club.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" called Crowe’s principal book on the Roma (Gypsies), \"A History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia\" (1998), “the most comprehensive and indispensable of its kind in English.” Ian Hancock said it was “remarkably thorough and compassionate,” while a reviewer in \"Ethnic and Racial Studies\" wrote that it was a “clearly first rate” study that was “impeccably researched, extremely informational and well written. Most importantly, Crowe’s volume fills an obvious and long-standing void in the literature.” It was also chosen as a selection of the History Book Club.\n\nIn 2007, an updated, second edition of \"The History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia\" was published, which had a new chapter that dealt with the history of the Roma in each country discussed in the first edition, plus the new states that had emerged from the ashes of the former communist nations in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Andre Liebich, who wrote the Forward to the new edition, called it “a path-breaking work of scholarship” that dealt with “a subject of considerable historical fascination and great contemporary relevance.”\n\nCrowe’s other books include:\n\n\n\"Da tu-sha gen-yuan li-shi yu yubo\" [The Holocaust: Roots, History and Aftermath]\n\n\"Oskar Schindler: Prawdziwa historia\" [Oskar Schindler; The True Story]\n\n\"Oskar Schindler: De biografie en het ware verhaal achter de “Schindlerlijst\" [The Biography and True Story behind Schindler’s List] (Amsterdam: Uitgeverj Verbum, 2006)\n\n\"Oskar Schindler: Die Biografie\" [Oskar Schindler: The Biography] (Berlin: Eichborn, 2005)\n\n\"Istoriya Tsigan Skhidnoi Evropi ta Rosii\" [A History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia] (Kiev: Vidavinstvo “Megataip, 2003)\n\n\"Gipushi no Rekishi Tohoh Roshia no Roma Minzoku\" [A History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia] (Tokyo: Kyodotsushimsha, 2001)\n\nCrowe has written scores of book chapters, articles, and reviews on a wide range of topics.

In its philosophical usage \"epoché\" describes the state where all judgments about non-evident matters are suspended in order to induce a state of ataraxia (freedom from worry and anxiety). This concept was developed by the Pyrrhonist school of philosophy and was also employed in Academic Skepticism.\n\nEpoché plays an implicit role in subsequent skeptical thought, as in René Descartes' epistemic principle of methodic doubt. The term was popularized in modern philosophy by Edmund Husserl. Husserl elaborates the notion of 'phenomenological epoché' or 'bracketing' in \"Ideas I\". Through the systematic procedure of 'phenomenological reduction', one is thought to be able to suspend judgment regarding the general or naive philosophical belief in the existence of the external world, and thus examine phenomena as they are originally given to consciousness.\n\nEpoché plays an important role in Pyrrhonism, the skeptical philosophy named after Pyrrho. Pyrrhonism provides practitioners with techniques for achieving epoché through use of the Ten Modes of Aenesidemus, the Five Modes of Agrippa, and the Pyrrhonist maxims. Pyrrhonism is mostly known today through the writings of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus whose surviving works appear to be an encyclopedia of Pyrrhonist arguments for inducing epoché across a breadth of philosophical and other intellectual issues of antiquity.\n\nIn phenomenological research epoché is described as a process involved in blocking biases and assumptions in order to explain a phenomenon in terms of its own inherent system of meaning. This is a general predisposition one must assume before commencing phenomenological study. It is different from bracketing, which is to acknowledge any personal bias or contextual assumptions of the researcher. This involves systematic steps to \"set aside\" various assumptions and beliefs about a phenomenon in order to examine how the phenomenon presents itself in the world of the participant.\n\n"}

In 1879 he enrolled at the Law Faculty of the University of Naples. He became a follower of Mazzini and adhered to Italian irredentism. He had a particular interest in both ancient history and for the social problems of Southern Italy, inspired by the example of the historian Giustino Fortunato.\n\nCiccotti, raised in the poor southern region of Basilicata, adhered to the group of socio-political thinker's known as \"meridionalisti\" (\"southernists\"), aspiring to solve the economic problems of Southern Italy after the Italian unification. They claimed that the economic policies of the central government of the new state discriminated against the interests of the south while favoring those of north.\n\nIn 1889, Ciccotti attended the University of Rome and gained a teaching qualification in classical antiquities. He won the competition for the ancient history chair at the Scientific-Literary Academy (\"Accademia scientifico-letteraria\") in Milan in 1891. Meanwhile, he started to cooperate with the socialist Filippo Turati and his journal \"Critica Sociale\". He adhered to the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), where he raised the issue of the underdevelopment of Southern Italy. His political involvement caused him the hostility of the Milanese conservatives, and in 1897 he lost his position at the Academy.\n\nHe was appointed professor of ancient history at the University of Pavia, but his attacks on the government and solidarity for the workers on the occasion of the tragic events in Milan in May 1898 earned him an arrest warrant for subversive incitement. He went into exile, taking refuge in Geneva (Switzerland), hosted by Maffeo Pantaleoni. Here he met Vilfredo Pareto and the German social-democrat August Bebel, and wrote a report on the events in Milan, \"The revolt of Milan: Notes of a refugee\", but lost his job at Pavia.\n\nAs a historian, Ciccotti was the first to give a Marxist economic account of the decline of slavery in the Roman Empire, in contrast to religious-ethical explanations in his book \"Il tramonto della schiavitu nel mondo antico\" (The Sunset of Slavery in the Ancient World), published in 1899. Economic changes rendered slavery expensive and inefficient, and doomed it to extinction.\n\nIn June 1900, he was elected in the Italian Chamber of Deputies (1900-1904) in the Vicaria district of Naples, upsetting the traditional electoral alliance between local politicians and the Camorra. In 1904, he lost his seat due to active campaigning of the Camorra against him. He was re-elected in 1909 and remained a Deputy until September 1919. Meanwhile, Ciccotti initiated the translation in Italian of the major works of the Socialist theorists Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Ferdinand Lassalle.\n\nIn the decade before the First World War, he gradually distanced himself more and more from the official line of the Socialist Party, although he kept on contributing to the socialist newspaper \"Avanti!\". He criticized the party, which he considered to be too much focused on the problems of the \"Northern\", industrialist working man, and too little inclined to understand the problems of the impoverished rural populace of the South. Ciccotti defined the prejudices against southern Italians as the anti-Semitism of Italy. In contrast with the PSI, he was in favour of an Italian intervention in the First World War.\n\nHis pro-war stance and dislike of the liberal Giovanni Giolitti – Ciccotti called Giolittianism the \"death of political life\" –, and in opposition to the post-war revolutionary movements, he looked sympathetically at the rising Fascism an its leader Benito Mussolini. \"In today's evident scarcity of political personalities, Mussolini is the one that more than any other, if not the only one, can deserve this name,\" Ciccotti wrote in September 1922.\n\nIn September 1924, he was rewarded with a seat for life in the Italian Senate. He opposed the move to authoritarian rule of Mussolini, but did not resign. He mainly dedicated his time to study history. In 1931, when demanded to pledge an oath of allegiance to the Fascist regime, Ciccotti initially protested, but eventually took the oath all the same. Finally he opposed, and openly, to the dictatorship of Mussolini when he sensed that the regime was heading to the adventure of a war, which he considered the inevitable conclusion of authoritarian and populist regimes. He died in Rome on 20 May 1939 at the age of 76.\n\n"}
{"id": "47971685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47971685", "title": "Extended evolutionary synthesis", "text": "Extended evolutionary synthesis\n\nThe extended evolutionary synthesis consists of a set of theoretical concepts more comprehensive than the earlier modern synthesis of evolutionary biology that took place between 1918 and 1942. The extended evolutionary synthesis was called for in the 1950s by C. H. Waddington, argued for on the basis of punctuated equilibrium by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge in the 1980s, and was reconceptualized in 2007 by Massimo Pigliucci and Gerd B. Müller.\n\nThe extended evolutionary synthesis revisits the relative importance of different factors at play, examining several assumptions of the earlier synthesis, and augmenting it with additional causative factors. It includes multilevel selection, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, niche construction, evolvability, and several concepts from evo-devo.\n\nNot all biologists have agreed on the need for, or the scope of, an extended synthesis. Many have collaborated on another synthesis in evolutionary developmental biology, which concetrates on developmental molecular genetics and evolution to understand how natural selection operated on developmental processes and deep homologies between organisms at the level of highly conserved genes.\n\nThe modern synthesis was the widely accepted early-20th-century synthesis reconciling Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and Gregor Mendel's theory of genetics in a joint mathematical framework. It established evolution as biology's central paradigm. The 19th-century ideas of natural selection by Darwin and Mendelian genetics were united by researchers who included Ronald Fisher, one of the three founders of population genetics, and J. B. S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, between 1918 and 1932. Julian Huxley introduced the phrase \"modern synthesis\" in his 1942 book, \"\".\n\nDuring the 1950s, the English biologist C. H. Waddington called for an extended synthesis based on his research on epigenetics and genetic assimilation. An extended synthesis was also proposed by the Austrian zoologist Rupert Riedl, with the study of evolvability. In 1978, Michael J. D. White wrote about an extension of the modern synthesis based on new research from speciation.\n\nIn the 1980s, the American palaeontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge argued for an extended synthesis based on their idea of punctuated equilibrium, the role of species selection shaping large scale evolutionary patterns and natural selection working on multiple levels extending from genes to species.\nThe ethologist John Endler wrote a paper in 1988 discussing processes of evolution that he felt had been neglected.\n\nSome researchers in the field of evolutionary developmental biology proposed another synthesis. They argue that the modern and extended syntheses should mostly center on genes and suggest an integration of embryology with molecular genetics an evolution, aiming to understand how natural selection operates on gene regulation and deep homologies between organisms at the level of highly conserved genes, transcription factors and signalling pathways. By contrast, a different strand of evo-devo following an organismal approach contributes to the extended synthesis by emphasizing (amongst others) developmental bias (both through facilitation and constraint), evolvability, and inherency of form as primary factors in the evolution of complex structures and phenotypic novelties.\n\nThe idea of an extended synthesis was relaunched in 2007 by Massimo Pigliucci, and Gerd B. Müller with a book in 2010 titled \"Evolution: The Extended Synthesis\", which has served as a launching point for work on the extended synthesis. This includes:\n\n\nOther processes such as evolvability, phenotypic plasticity, reticulate evolution, sex evolution and symbiogenesis are said by proponents to have been excluded or missed from the modern synthesis. The goal of Piglucci's and Müller's extended synthesis is to take evolution beyond the gene-centered approach of population genetics to consider more organism- and ecology-centered approaches. Many of these causes are currently considered secondary in evolutionary causation, and proponents of the extended synthesis want them to be considered first-class evolutionary causes. The biologist Eugene Koonin wrote in 2009 that \"the new developments in evolutionary biology by no account should be viewed as refutation of Darwin. On the contrary, they are widening the trails that Darwin blazed 150 years ago and reveal the extraordinary fertility of his thinking.\"\n\nThe extended synthesis is characterized by its additional set of predictions that differ from the standard modern synthesis theory:\n\n\nThe extended evolutionary synthesis is currently being tested by a group of scientists from eight institutions in Britain, Sweden and the United States. The £7.7 million project is supported by a £5.7 million grant from the John Templeton Foundation.\n\nThe project is headed by Kevin N. Laland at the University of St Andrews and Tobias Uller at Lund University. According to Laland what the extended synthesis \"really boils down to is recognition that, in addition to selection, drift, mutation and other established evolutionary processes, other factors, particularly developmental influences, shape the evolutionary process in important ways.\"\n\nBiologists disagree on the need for an extended synthesis. Opponents contend that the modern synthesis is able to fully account for the newer observations, whereas others criticize that the Extended synthesis is not radical enough. Proponents think that the conceptions of evolution at the core of the modern synthesis are too narrow. Proponents argue that even when the modern synthesis allows for the ideas in the extended synthesis, using the modern synthesis affects the way that biologists think about evolution. For example, Denis Noble says that using terms and categories of the modern synthesis distort the picture of biology that modern experimentation has discovered. Proponents therefore claim that the extended synthesis is necessary to help expand the conceptions and framework of how evolution is considered throughout the biological disciplines.\n\nDefend the extended synthesis\n\nCriticism of the extended synthesis\n\n"}

{"id": "1245096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1245096", "title": "Gershom Scholem", "text": "Gershom Scholem\n\nGerhard Scholem who, after his immigration from Germany to Israel, changed his name to Gershom Scholem (Hebrew: גרשום שלום) (December 5, 1897 – February 21, 1982), was a German-born Israeli philosopher and historian. He is widely regarded as the founder of the modern, academic study of Kabbalah, becoming the first Professor of Jewish Mysticism at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His close friends included Walter Benjamin and Leo Strauss, and selected letters from his correspondence with those philosophers have been published.\n\nScholem is best known for his collection of lectures, \"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism\" (1941) and for his biography \"Sabbatai Zevi, the Mystical Messiah\" (1957). His collected speeches and essays, published as \"On Kabbalah and its Symbolism\" (1965), helped to spread knowledge of Jewish mysticism among both Jews and non-Jews.\n\nGerhard Scholem was born in Berlin to Arthur Scholem and Betty Hirsch Scholem. His interest in Judaica was strongly opposed by his father, a printer, but, thanks to his mother's intervention, he was allowed to study Hebrew and the Talmud with an Orthodox rabbi.\n\nGerhard Scholem met Walter Benjamin in Munich in 1915, when the former was seventeen years old and the latter was twenty-three. They began a lifelong friendship that ended only with Benjamin's suicide, committed while fleeing Nazi persecution in 1940. Scholem dedicated his book \"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism\" (\"Die jüdische Mystik in ihren Hauptströmungen\"), based on lectures 1938–1957, to his friend Benjamin. In 1915 Scholem enrolled at the Frederick William University in Berlin (today, Humboldt University), where he studied mathematics, philosophy, and Hebrew, and where he came into contact with Martin Buber, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Hayim Nahman Bialik, Ahad Ha'am, and Zalman Shazar.\n\nIn Berlin, Scholem first befriended and became an admirer of Leo Strauss (their correspondence would continue throughout his life). He subsequently studied mathematical logic at the University of Jena under Gottlob Frege. He was in Bern in 1918 with Benjamin when he met Elsa (Escha) Burchhard, who became his first wife. Scholem returned to Germany in 1919, where he received a degree in semitic languages at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich. Less notable in his academic career was his establishment of the fictive University of Muri with Benjamin.\n\nScholem wrote his doctoral thesis on the oldest known kabbalistic text, \"Sefer ha-Bahir\". Drawn to Zionism, and influenced by Buber, he emigrated in 1923 to the British Mandate of Palestine, where he devoted his time to studying Jewish mysticism and became a librarian, and eventually head of the Department of Hebrew and Judaica at the National Library. He later became a lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Scholem taught the Kabbalah and mysticism from a scientific point of view and became the first professor of Jewish mysticism at the university in 1933, working in this post until his retirement in 1965, when he became an emeritus professor. In 1936, he married his second wife, Fania Freud.\n\nScholem's brother Werner was a member of the ultra-left \"Fischer-Maslow Group\" and the youngest ever member of the Reichstag, representing the Communist Party (KPD) in the German parliament. He was expelled from the party and later murdered by the Nazis during the Third Reich. Gershom Scholem, unlike his brother, was vehemently opposed to both Communism and Marxism.\n\nScholem died in Jerusalem, where he is buried next to his wife in the Sanhedria Cemetery. Jürgen Habermas delivered the eulogy.\n\n\nScholem directly contrasted his historiographical approach on the study of Jewish mysticism with the approach of the 19th-century school of the \"Wissenschaft des Judentums\" (\"Science of Judaism\"), which sought to submit the study of Judaism to the discipline of subjects such as history, philology, and philosophy. According to Jeremy Adler, Scholem's thinking was \"both recognizably Jewish and deeply German,\" and \"changed the course of twentieth-century European thought.\"\n\nJewish mysticism was seen as Judaism's weakest scholarly link. Scholem told the story of his early research when he was directed to a prominent rabbi who was an expert on Kabbalah. Seeing the rabbi's many books on the subject, Scholem asked about them, only to be told: \"This trash? Why would I waste my time reading nonsense like this?\" (Robinson 2000, p. 396)\n\nThe analysis of Judaism carried out by the \"Wissenschaft\" school was flawed in two ways, according to Scholem:\n\n\nIn Scholem's opinion, the mythical and mystical components were at least as important as the rational ones, and he thought that they, rather than the minutiae of Halakha, were the truly living core of Judaism. In particular, he disagreed with what he considered to be Martin Buber's personalization of Kabbalistic concepts as well as what he argued was an inadequate approach to Jewish history, Hebrew language, and the land of Israel.\n\nIn the \"Weltanschauung\" of Scholem, the research of Jewish mysticism could not be separated from its historical context. Starting from something similar to the \"Gegengeschichte\" of Friedrich Nietzsche he ended up including less normative aspects of the Judaism in the public history.\n\nSpecifically, Scholem thought that Jewish history could be divided into three periods:\n\n\nThe notion of the three periods, with its interactions between rational and irrational elements in Judaism, led Scholem to put forward some controversial arguments. He thought that the 17th century messianic movement, known as Sabbatianism, was developed from the Lurianic Kabbalah. In order to neutralize Sabbatianism, Hasidism had emerged as a Hegelian synthesis. Many of those who joined the Hasidic movement, because they had seen in it an Orthodox congregation, considered it scandalous that their community should be associated with a heretical movement.\n\nIn the same way, Scholem produced the hypothesis that the source of the 13th century Kabbalah was a Jewish gnosticism that preceded Christian gnosticism.\n\nThe historiographical approach of Scholem also involved a linguistic theory. In contrast to Buber, Scholem believed in the power of the language to invoke supernatural phenomena. In contrast to Walter Benjamin, he put the Hebrew language in a privileged position with respect to other languages, as the only language capable of revealing the divine truth. Scholem considered the Kabbalists as interpreters of a pre-existent linguistic revelation.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, Scholem sharply criticised Hannah Arendt's book, \"\" and decried her lack of \"ahavath Yisrael\" (solidarity with the Jewish people). Arendt responded that she never loved any collective group, and that she does not love the Jewish people but was only part of them. The bitter fight, which was exchanged in various articles, made Scholem break off ties with Arendt and refuse to forgive her. Scholem wrote to Hans Paeschke that he \"knew Hannah Arendt when she was a socialist or half-communist and...when she was a Zionist. I am astounded by her ability to pronounce upon movements in which she was once so deeply engaged, in terms of a distance measured in light years and from such sovereign heights.”\n\nVarious other Israeli and Jewish academics also broke off ties with Arendt, claiming that her lack of solidarity with the Jewish people in their time of need was appalling, along with her victimization of various Nazis. Before the Eichmann trial, Scholem also opposed Arendt's interpretation (in letters and the introduction to \"Illuminations\") of Walter Benjamin as a Marxist thinker who predated the New Left. For Scholem, Benjamin had been an essentially religious thinker, whose turn to Marxism had been merely an unfortunate, but inessential and superficial, expedient.\n\nVarious stories and essays of the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges were inspired or influenced by Scholem's books. He has also influenced ideas of Umberto Eco, Jacques Derrida, Harold Bloom, Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, and George Steiner. American author Michael Chabon cites Scholem's essay, \"The Idea of the Golem\", as having assisted him in conceiving the Pulitzer-Prize winning book \"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Tradition holds that Charlemagne granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting the Moors. In the 9th century, Charlemagne's grandson, Charles the Bald, named the Count of Urgell as overlord of Andorra. A descendant of the count later gave the lands to the Diocese of Urgell.\n\nIn the 11th century, fearing military action by neighboring lords, the Bishop of Urgell placed himself under the protection of the Lord of Caboet, a Catalan nobleman. Later, the Count of Foix became heir to the Lord of Caboet through marriage, and a dispute arose between the Occitan Count and the Catalan bishop over Andorra.\n\nIn 1278, the conflict was resolved by the signing of a pareage (\"pariatges\"), which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the Count of Foix and the Bishop of La Seu d'Urgell (Catalonia). The pareage, a feudal institution recognizing the principle of equality of rights shared by two rulers, gave the small state its territory and political form. In return, Andorra pays an annual tribute or \"questia\" to the co-rulers consisting of four hams, forty loaves of bread, and some wine. Andorra's borders have remained unchanged since 1278.\n\nAndorra was briefly annexed to the Crown of Aragon twice, in 1396 and 1512.\n\nIn 1505, Germaine of Foix married Ferdinand V of Castile, thereby bringing the lordship of Andorra under Spanish rule. On taking over the kingdom in 1519, Emperor Charles V granted the lordship of Les Valls, as it was then known, to Germaine of Foix’s line in perpetuity. Calvinist king Henry III of Navarre, who was also count of Foix, in 1589 ascended the French throne as Henry IV, and by an edict of 1607 transferred his role as co-prince of Andorra to the head of the French state.\n\nIn 1793, the French revolutionary government refused the traditional Andorran tribute as smacking of feudalism and renounced its suzerainty, despite the wish of the Andorrans to enjoy French protection and avoid being under exclusively Spanish influence.\n\nAndorra remained neutral during the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon restored the co-principality in 1806 after the Andorrans petitioned him to do so. French title to the principality subsequently passed from the kings to the president of France. In the period 1812–13, the French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it in four departments. Andorra was also annexed and made part of the district of Puigcerdà (département of Sègre).\n\nIn 1933, France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On July 12, 1934, an adventurer named Boris Skossyreff issued a proclamation in Urgel, declaring himself Boris I, sovereign prince of Andorra, simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on July 20 and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain.\n\nDuring World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route from Spain into France. The French Resistance used Andorra as part of their route to get downed airmen out of France. \n\nIn 1943, Andorra carried out its first execution since the 19th century: Antoni Arenis was executed for double fratricide by firing squad because a trained executioner was unavailable to operate the legal method, by garrote.\n\nIn 1958, Andorra declared peace with Germany. It had been forgotten in the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I and so the conflict had been extended by the lack of a peace treaty, and both had legally remained at war.\n\nLong an impoverished land with little contact with any nations other than adjoining France and Spain, Andorra, after World War II, achieved considerable prosperity through a developing tourist industry. That development, abetted by improvements in transport and communications, has tended to break down Andorra’s isolation and to bring Andorrans into the mainstream of European history. Public demands for democratic reforms led to the extension of the franchise to women in the 1970s and to the creation of new and more fully autonomous organs of government in the early 1980s.\n\nAndorra formally became a parliamentary democracy in May 1993 following approval of a new constitution by a popular referendum in March 1993. The new constitution retained the French and Spanish co-princes although with reduced and narrowly defined powers. Civil rights were greatly expanded, including the legalisation of political parties and the provision for an independent judiciary. Andorra joined a customs union with the European Communities (now the EU) in 1991 and was admitted to the UN on 28 July 1993. The country\nhas been seeking ways to improve its export potential and increase its economic ties with its European neighbours. The financial services sector of the economy is highly important because of Andorra's status as a tax haven and its banking secrecy laws.\n\n\n\n"}

Cadden served as President of the History of Science Society (HSS) from 2006-2007. She retired and became Professor Emeritus at UC Davis in 2008.\n\nHer work has been characterized as exploring the \"seams of disciplines\"—the connections between history of science, gender history, history of sexuality, social history, and intellectual history. Methodologically, she broke new ground, paying \"particular attention to the cultural and social milieux these sources were produced in; to the assumptions and expectations of authors and readers; to questions of form, style, and presentation.\"\n\nHer book \"Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Age: Medicine, Science, and Culture\" (1993) was groundbreaking in its examination of sex and gender, and has deeply influenced subsequent scholarship. Cadden examines the discussions of sexual difference from Aristotle through the fourteenth century, revealing a wide range of ideas about sexual determination, reproductive roles and sexual pleasure. She finds multiple models of sexuality in writings throughout the middles ages. This challenged Thomas Laqueur's assertion in \"Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud\" (1990) that male and female were seen as \"manifestations of a unified substratum\" before the 18th century. Cadden addressed medieval discourse in all its \"staggering complexity\", an \"interconnectedness of intellectual interests\" that was \"far from comforting\" in its diversity.\n\nShe went on to research Pietro D'Abano and to explore the complexities of medieval natural philosophers' understanding of homosexual desire in her book \"Nothing Natural Is Shameful: Sodomy and Science in Late Medieval Europe\" (2013). Although she recognizes its limitations, she uses the medieval term \"sodomy\" to avoid conflation with modern senses of the term \"homosexuality\". Discussion focuses around Aristotle's \"Problemata IV.26\" and its questioning of male-male sexual desire. The book has been described as \"a sophisticated reflection on sex and sexuality.\"\n\nHer book \"Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Age: Medicine, Science, and Culture\" (1993) received the 1994 Pfizer Prize for outstanding book on the history of science from the History of Science Society.

His rare ability to combine theoretical and practical analyses made particularly valuable his scientific works.\n\nInitially M. van Meerhaeghe thought about a military career. In 1939 he passed the entrance exams for the École Royale Militaire (ERM). After the campaign of 1940 followed about seven months as a prisoner of war in a German camp (an intervention of King Leopold III resulted in the release of the ERM-students).\n\nAt Ghent University (Belgium) van Meerhaeghe obtained a Masters degree in Economic Sciences in 1944 (first diet: July) and a Masters in Political Science and Sociology, also in 1944 (second diet: September). As regards the economics studies he attended the lectures given by Professor Raoul Miry who was the counterpart of Professor Gaston Eyskens of the University of Leuven.\n\nIn 1946 he obtained his PhD: \"Aviation in the traffic economy : the Belgian case in particular\".\n\nIn 1947 he became part-time lecturer political economy at the Koloniale Hogeschool (Antwerp) and in 1955 part-time lecturer colonial economy at the University of Ghent.\n\nBefore becoming Professor of economics and international economics at the University of Ghent in 1957, he worked as economic advisor in the Belgian Ministry of Economic Affairs, as 'faculty advisor' of the NATO Defence College in Paris (1953–54) and as an advisor to the Minister of Foreign Trade.\n\nHis interest covered all types of international academic cooperation and face-to-face interaction, which is why in September 1959 he was appointed visiting professor at the Official University of Belgian Kongo and Ruanda-Urundi in Elisabethville for the courses \"Histoire des doctrines sociales et économiques\" and \"Histoire des doctrines économiques\". He obtained a visiting professorship at the universities of Amsterdam in 1962 and Constantine (Algeria) in 1975, as well as becoming a visiting fellow at Wolfson College, Cambridge in 1973.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1969 he was Vice-President and (since 1964) President of the Prices Commission, an advisory body to the Minister for Economic Affairs (replaced in 1969 by the \"Commission pour la régulation des prix\" : Royal Decree June 3, 1969).\n\nBetween 1962 and 1969 he was co-opted as a member of the \"Conseil Central de l'Économie\", the umbrella institution of the Belgian federal social and economic dialogue.\n\nSince 1971 he was also a member of the board of the \"Belgian-Luxemburg Exchange Control\" (Institut Belgo-Luxembourgeois du Change), chaired by the Governor of the Belgian National Bank: until November 2002 when this institution was dissolved (Euro).\n\nBetween 1972 and 1980 he was a member of the \"conseil général\" of the Caisse générale d'épargne et de retraite.\n\nAt its editors' request, van Meerhaeghe started a column in the Flemish business magazine Trends in 1975. He also featured as a regular columnist in the newspaper The Standaard between 1988 and 1996.\n\nLuc Versele, since 2017 chairman of the Belgian bank Crelan, was an assistent of Professor van Meerhaeghe at Ghent University.\n\nM. van Meerhaeghe was always steadfast in taking a strictly independent line of argument. By all means he was an individualist – one might say a 'loner' – concurring with the suggestion of A. Einstein that the ideal occupation for the theoretical scientist is that of a lighthouse keeper. Unfortunately, sometimes he was misunderstood by persons driven by ignorance, superficiality and envy towards the well-heeled. An example of a rule of best practice that leads to controversy when publicly stated: «\"A firm that puts the ethical considerations of other stakeholders such as employees first and business second could undermine the overall welfare of the firm and its shareholders/owners and even its employees\"» (van Meerhaeghe quoted by Professor Tom Turner and Dr. Lorraine Ryan).\n\nA significant part of van Meerhaeghe's work belongs to what is commonly labelled as the American theory of public choice. He advocated great concern for a sound use of government means (struggle against profligacy) and was favourable towards Taxpayers Associations (USA, Sweden, Federal Republic of Germany) that facilitate the contacts between the authorities and the public opinion.\n\nAfter his Belgian retirement on October 1, 1986 van Meerhaeghe was successively visiting professor in international economics and European integration at the Centre of International Studies of the Tilburg University (1987), at the London School of Economics, London University (academic year 1987-88 – the Belgian Chair), at the university of Torino (1989-92: Professor Count di Robilant of the Faculty of Law; 1997-98: Faculty of Economics) and during the academic years 1993-95 at the university of Rome (La Sapienza).\n\nIn 1987-1988 he was 'Special Adviser to the Commission of the European Communities', more particularly to Mr Willy De Clercq, former Belgian Vice Prime Minister and a member of the Commission (1985–1989: Commissioner for External Relations, responsible for international relations and foreign trade).\n\nM. van Meerhaeghe was member of the academic advisory council of the Brussels think-tank \"Institut Européen\" (Institutum Europaeum : 1979-2002) and the think-tank Centre for the New Europe (1993-2009). At the last one he published \"The Information Policy of the European Commission\" (Vol. 4, Zellik April 1995). Since 1988 he was a Life Member of the Mont Pèlerin Society.\n\nBetween 1986 and 2009 he chaired the Board of Directors of \"Centrale Kredietverlening\" (CKV), a small savings bank.\n\nM. van Meerhaeghe is the author of 22 books (editor of 4 collective works) and about 160 articles.\n\nAlready early in his career (in an article of 1947) he took a position: he opposed the numerous publications that have no relation whatsoever with reality («struggle for life») and especially deplored the mania for addressing everything with mathematics. He was in favor of operational economics, helpful to practitioners (\"nützlich\"). Later he elaborated his criticism in \"Economic Theory. A Critic's Companion\" (Martinus Nijhoff 1980), probably his most important work. It caused quite a stir because of its unconventional approach. (K. Nakaura published a Japanese translation.) Guy Routh wrote a favourable review in \"The Economic Journal\" (Vol. 91, No. 362, June 1981, pp. 589–605): \"Professor van Meerhaeghe's book is a masterpiece of condensation: a review of economic theory from Plato to Friedman, with the faults exposed, in 109 pages of text. Six chapters deal with the main divisions of the subject (consumer behaviour, producer behaviour, price, income distribution, general level of income and prices, growth, and international trade), one with its practicability, one with its significance, and an appendix added that surveys thirteen types of theory. The preface modestly disclaims any intention of instructing fellow economists. The book is intended as a complement to an introductory course in economics. It is reminiscent of a surveyors report of a tumble-down house. It is unfit for human habitation, one would be mad to buy it, but one does, patches it up together as best one can, and inhabits it contentedly, gradually becoming inured to its defects.\" G. Routh's conclusion is brief and to the point : \"This guarantees van Meerhaeghe's slim volume a long life. I fear that in ten years time its criticisms will be as valid and as relevant as they are today\". He proved to be something of an optimist: they remain as valid today as they did in 1981.\n\nAs the most significant pieces of work we mention:\n\n\nTeaching international economics results in delivering lectures at a variety of universities and international conferences: Warsaw (1961), Geneva (Conference on science and technology in promoting the development of developing countries), Pretoria (1964; Cultural Treaty between South-Africa, the Netherlands and Belgium), Bratislava, Reggio Calabria, Hull, Prague (1969 an 1989), Iasi (1971), Alvor, Vienna (U.N.I.D.O.), Berlin, Uppsala, New York, Cracow (1977), Sofia, Naples, Florence, Moscow (1992), Jena, Orel, Valencia, Göteborg, Porto, Lisbon, Venice (2001), etc. Some lectures were later published as an essay in their own right, e.g.:\n\n\nIn order to understand economic problems, at all times the contemporary political, social, psychological and cultural factors have to be taken into account (the role of context: \"are the assumptions vindicated or wrongheaded\" ?). Relentlessly van Meerhaeghe insisted upon the necessity of knowledge of the historic backgrounds. Indeed, as history was his favoured subject area, since 1999 he was very active for the Annual Heilbronn Symposium in Economics and the Social Sciences because it goes back to the old masters, i.e. the German classicists of the 19th (and even 18th) century. The German universities attracted many foreign students with a knowledge of German. Nowadays, some of these 'scholars' tend to invent theories which had already been formulated in Germany during the 19th century. Hence the observation, made in \"Economic Theory\" (see above) that «far too often in economics, conclusions that were already formulated long ago are drawn triumphantly» (p. 4).

She was the eldest daughter of Thomas William and Eliza (born Hall) Allies. Her father had been a fellow at Oxford and he had risen to be the chaplain to the Bishop of London. He had however made a life-changing move to Roman Catholicism in 1850. \n\nHer father was secretary of the Catholic Poor School Committee. She had five siblings and they lived in St John's Wood in London where it is presumed she was born. The family moved to Portman Square and Mary boarded at Holy Child College, a Catholic school in St Leonards-on-Sea operated by the Society of the Holy Child Jesus (later merged into their Mayfield school), and subsequently Catholic boarding schools in Paris. Allies gave a lot of respect to her father and in time she would write his biography. She said that she fed \"on the marrow of his mind\" when she was the only child living at home. Her first work, \"The Life of Pius VII\", was published in 1875. It was well researched, but strongly pro-Catholic. The book looked at a supreme pope in conflict with the Napoleonic French state. Pius VII's conflict included him being arrested. Allies' biography was based on sources in four languages. This, and the shorter version published in 1897, is still (2004) the only available biography of Pius VII in English and is therefore a standard work.\n\nHer next work was considered too pious and uncritical of her subjects. She wrote about the Dominican friar Saint Vincent Ferrier, Saint Bernardino of Siena and the \"Soldier Saint\" John of Capistrano. Her next work was taken from the works Saint Augustine which was published in 1886 and this was followed up by his letters. In the interim she published a book about another Catholic saint, John Chrysostom, in 1889. A different title was \"The History of the Church of England\" which she published between 1892 and 1897. This was a partisan view of the Anglican church before 1603.\n\nShe translated an extract of John of Damascus's \"De fide Orthoxa\" in 1898. When her mother died in 1902 and her father the following year she occupied herself writing a biography of her father, writing journal articles and caring for her brother's children.

He was a temporary Otaman of Council of Ministers (Prime Minister of Ukraine), minister of Education, and director of the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine).\n\nMykola Vasylenko was born on in a village Esman (today a small settlement of Hlukhiv Raion). He finished a progymnasium in Hlukhiv and a full gymnasium in Poltava. After that Vasylenko studied at the history and philology faculty of Yuriev University (University of Tartu). In 1890 he defended his scientific work \"Critical overview of literature from the history of regional assemblies\" and became a candidate of Russian history.\n\nSince 1890 Vasylenko worked as a teacher of history in Kiev gymnasiums, simultaneously working for the Historical society of Nestor the Chronicler. At the same time he attended lectures of Volodymyr Antonovych, Volodymyr Ikonnikov, Oleksandr Lazarevsky and others in Kiev University. Vasylenko also was co-editor and published his scientific works in magazine \"Kievskaya starina\" (\"Kiev olden\"). In 1893-94 there appeared his first fundamental scientific works particularly the monograph \"Servitude and the issue of servitude in Southwestern Krai\".\n\nDuring 1903-05 Vasylenko was a researcher for the Kiev Governorate Statistic Committee. He also was a member of Kiev Old Hromada as well as other public and cultural societies. Vasylenko was a sympathizer of the 1905 Revolution in Russian Empire and during the period he edited a newspaper \"Kievskie otkliki\" (\"Kiev feedbacks\"). For illegal fundraising to help workers of Saint Petersburg and Kiev, support of 1905 sappers revolt in Kiev, connections with revolutionary leaders, publication of articles of \"anti-state\" content in \"Kievskie otkliki\", Mykola Vasylenko was convicted to a year in prison which he served in Kresty Prison (Saint Petersburg). During his detention in Kresty, Vasylenko studied law and eventually passed the test of the Justice faculty program of Novorossiya University (Odessa University).\n\nIn 1909 he was admitted to Kiev University as an assistant professor (privatdozent). At the time Vasylenko was a member of secret public organization and political alliance, the Society of Ukrainian Progressors. In 1910 he received the academic degree of Master of Law. However, due to \"political unreliability\" the imperial administration prohibited him to teach in higher educational institutions. Therefore, Vasylenko worked as a fellow barrister for the Odessa court chamber.\n\nAround that time in 1910 Vasylenko joined the Constitutional Democratic Party that agreed to Ukrainian language in schools, courts, churches and promoted only the cultural autonomy of Ukraine. Affiliation to Kadets affected relationships of Vasylenko with activists of Ukrainian national-liberation movement.\n\nAfter the February Revolution on initiative of Mykhailo Hrushevsky, Mykola Vasylenko was invited to the Central Council of Ukraine on position of deputy chairman, but he did not actively participated in the council's sessions. On March 24, 1917 the Russian Provisional Government appointed Vasylenko as a curator of the Kiev school district and on August 19, 1917 he became a deputy minister of Education in the Russian Provisional Government. Vasylenko was supporter of evolutionary development of system of the Ukrainian National Education that did not correspond to the policy of Ukrainiazation of education, established by the I and II All-Ukrainian Teachers congresses and carried out by the General Secretariat of Education (General Secretariat of Ukraine).\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "7649046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7649046", "title": "Newark Holy Stones", "text": "Newark Holy Stones\n\nThe Newark Holy Stones refer to a set of artifacts allegedly discovered by David Wyrick in 1860 within a cluster of ancient Indian burial mounds near Newark, Ohio, now generally believed to be a hoax. The set consists of the Keystone, a stone bowl, and the Decalogue with its sandstone box. They can be viewed at the Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum in Coshocton, Ohio. The site where the objects were found is known as The Newark Earthworks, one of the biggest collections from an ancient American Indian culture known as the Hopewell that existed from approximately 100 BC to AD 500.\n\nThe first of these artifacts, popularly known as the \"Keystone\" due to its shape, was excavated in June 1860. Unlike other ancient artifacts found previously in this region, the Keystone was inscribed with Hebrew. It contains one phrase on each side:\n\n\nThe second find came later in November 1860 when Wyrick and his excavation team came across a sandstone box which contained a small, black rock within it. The black rock was identified as limestone by geologists Dave Hawkins and Ken Bork of Denison University. On this stone were carved Hebrew text that was translated to be a condensed version of the Ten Commandments. The name Decalogue Stone, comes from the translation of the Hebrew letters that outline the religious and moral codes described in Exodus 20:2-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21, which refer to the Decalogue or Ten Commandments. The inscription begins on the front at the top of an arch above the figure of a bearded man who is wearing a turban, robe, and appears to be holding a tablet. It runs down the left side, continues around all sides, and makes its way back to the front up the right side to where it began. This pattern indicates that the inscription was meant to be read repetitively. Right above the figure of the man is a separate inscription which translates to \"Moses\". This rock was carved with a unique form of Hebrew, which gave the appearance of ancient post-Exilic square Hebrew letters that later was shown to be derived from the modern Hebrew alphabet.\n\nIn 2014, Bradley Lepper of the Ohio History Connection discovered that a fragment of the wooden burial platform underneath which the Decalogue Stone was found had been preserved at Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History. This sample yielded a calibrated radiocarbon date range of CAL AD 70 to CAL AD 230 (95% probability). Since the platform had been made from an approximately 2-foot diameter oak tree, the burial itself could have been several decades later than this tree growth. These dates are consistent with the Hopewell culture that would have constructed the mound.\n\nThe Newark Holy Stones are an archaeological fraud used to support the \"Lost Tribes\" theory, which posits an ancient Israelite presence in Ohio. The idea that there is a connection between the ancient Hopewell mound builders and Jewish settlers that were in the Americas before Columbus is a form of pseudoarchaeology.\n\nThe first stone to be found was written in modern Hebrew. In July 1860 Abraham Geiger wrote in the New York Times that \"the bungling work of an unskilled stone mason and the strangeness of some letters as well as the many mistakes and transpositions was his fault. The letters are not antique. This is not a relic of hoary antiquity\".\n\nJust over three months later, the second stone was found. This was not only considerably more elaborate, it was written in archaic Hebrew. Ken Feder compares this with someone today announcing that they had discovered a hitherto unknown play by Shakespeare which was then exposed as a modern forgery, then shortly thereafter announcing the discovery of a more plausible new play.\n\nIt is possible that the stones were forged to support a political viewpoint. Brad Lepper, of the Ohio Historical Society who has extensively studied the Hopewell culture, suggests that the artifacts might have been scientifically forged to help advance the theory on monogenism. In 1860, slavery was a subject of heated debate that was reaching a critical point in American society. Anthropology and other forms of science were often used in defense or opposition. Discussions promoting monogenism, for example, were often used to oppose slavery and segregation.\n\nAmong some of the hoax theories is that Wyrick faked the artifacts and planted them at the excavation sites. Prior to his discovery, Wyrick supported the belief that the Lost Tribes of Israel were the ancestors of ancient mound builders in Ohio. Wyrick spent a great deal of time searching a number of excavation sites at various mounds attempting to find supporting evidence of this belief. Some argue that Wyrick could have become more desperate as time went by providing the motivation to commit such an act. \n\nIn 1861, Wyrick published a pamphlet that described his account of the artifact discoveries. The publishing included woodcuts of the inscriptions found on the stones. When comparing Wyrick's woodcuts of the Decalogue to the actual inscription found on the stone, Wyrick made at least 38 errors involving 256 Hebrew letters. Mistakes include illegible and omitted letters. Wyrick's depiction of Moses on the woodcuts had inconsistencies as well. Wyrick shows Moses wearing a beret instead of a turban. He also shows Moses in a 19th-century dress instead of the flowering robe shown on the stone.\n\nSome believe that the person or group responsible for the inscription had to have an extensive knowledge of the Hebrew language. Given that Wyrick made a large number of mistakes on the woodcuts seem to indicate that he may not have been the stone's author. Beverley H. Moseley, Jr., former art director of the Ohio Historical Society, compared the carving of Moses on the stone to Wyrick's woodcut copy. He concluded that both images couldn't have been made by the same person. After Wyrick's death, Colonel Charles Whittlesey published a paper in 1872 in which he recalls discovering a Hebrew Bible among Wyrick's personal items. Whittlesey concludes at the time that the stones were a hoax, and assumed that the Bible was Wyrick's source of inspiration for the inscription. However this theory was later discredited after it was determined that the letters used on the Decalogue did not represent a style that would have been consistent with the theory.\n\nThe Hebrew version used in the inscriptions is another point of contention. The version used was post-Exilic, which would be from a \"Lost\" Tribe. Some believe this is another example that shows the artifacts were either a hoax or did not date back to the time of the mound builders. Wyrick also made a claim in a letter he wrote to Joseph Henry in 1863—one year before his death—that he might have been a victim of a hoax.\n\nRev. John W. McCarty and Elijah Sutton were both residents of Newark when the Decalogue Stone and the Keystone were found. Elijah Sutton was a stonecutter with no other direct link to the event other than his part in carving Wyrick’s headstone when he died. However, it is asserted that because the Decalogue Stone is made from similar materials and is of the same width (thickness) as his headstones, he must have cut the stone. As for Rev. John W. McCarty, he played a more direct role in the artifact’s discovery.\n\nIt was with the help of McCarty that the stone was translated. Upon receiving the stone McCarty was able to translate it within hours. It is also likely that many Christian clergy supported the idea of the Lost Tribes myth during the 1800s, for it not only validated the Biblical tale of the Lost Tribes but also implied their religious right to continue colonize America and their Christianization of the Native Americans.\n\nThere were other stones found at the Newark site, like the Keystone. Two other stones were also found at Newark shortly after Wyrick’s death (they have since been lost). These stones were quickly dismissed as fakes when the local dentist, John H. Nicol, claimed that he had carved and introduced the stones to the site. \n\nA fifth stone was allegedly found at the same site as the Decalogue stone two years later by David M. Johnson, a banker, and Nathaniel Roe Bradner, a physician. Named the Johnson-Bradner Stone, it has since been lost. A lithograph of the stone, published in France, still survives.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "241261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241261", "title": "Orient", "text": "Orient\n\nThe Orient is a historical term for the \"East\", traditionally comprising anything that belongs to the Eastern world, in relation to Europe. In English, it is largely a metonym for, and coterminous with, the continent of Asia, loosely classified into the Near East, Middle East and Far East: the directional regions now known today as western Asia, southern Asia, eastern Asia, and southeast Asia (Note that traditionally directional regions of a continent do not use an upper-case letter). Originally, the term \"Orient\" was used to designate the Near East, and later its meaning evolved and expanded, designating also the Middle East or the Far East. \nThe term Oriental is often used to describe objects from the Orient. However, given its Eurocentric connotations and shifting, inaccurate definition through the ages, it is generally considered offensive as a label for people from Asia.\n\nThe term \"Orient\" derives from the Latin word \"oriens\" meaning \"east\" (lit. \"rising\" < \"orior\" \" rise\"). The use of the word for \"rising\" to refer to the east (where the sun rises) has analogs from many languages: compare the terms \"Levant\" (< French \"levant\" \"rising\"), \"Vostok\" (< Russian \"voskhod\" \"sunrise\"), \"Anatolia\" (< Greek \"anatole\"), \"mizrahi\" in Hebrew (\"zriha\" meaning sunrise), \"sharq\" (< Arabic ' \"rise\", ' \"rising\"), \"shygys\" (< Kazakh \"shygu\" \"come out\"), (< Turkish \"doğmak\" to be born; to rise), (, a pictograph of the sun rising behind a tree) and \"The Land of the Rising Sun\" to refer to Japan. Also, many ancient temples, including pagan temples and the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, were built with their main entrances facing the East. This tradition was carried on in Christian churches. To situate them in such a manner was to \"orient\" them in the proper direction. When something was facing the correct direction, it was said to be in the proper \"orientation\".\n\nAnother explanation of the term stems from Rome during the Roman Empire, specifically the Eastern Roman Empire, or the \"Roman Orient\", during the Byzantine Empire. Although the original East-West (or Orient-Occident) line was the Italian Peninsula's East Coast, around 600 AD this would shift to the City of Rome. Any area below the City of Rome was considered the Orient, as well as the ethnicities inhabiting the land, such as Dalmatian Italians, (modern Neapolitans along with Sicilians, Libyans, Moroccans, Greeks, etc.), as well as everything East of Southern Italy, hence the Italian name \"Italia nord-orientale\" (in English Northeast Italy) for Le Tre Venezie (the 3 Venices) located above the Roman latitude line separating it from modern Abruzzo; the beginning of the Orient in the East, while Lazio is its beginning in the West of the Italian Peninsula.\n\nThe opposite term \"Occident\" derives from the Latin word \"occidens\", meaning \"west\" (lit. \"setting\" < \"occido\" \"fall/set\"). This term meant the west (where the sun sets) but has fallen into disuse in English, in favor of \"Western world\".\n\nTerritorialization of the Roman term \"Orient\" occurred during the reign of emperor Diocletian (284-305), when the Diocese of the Orient (Latin: \"Dioecesis Orientis\") was formed. Later in the 4th century, the Praetorian prefecture of the Orient (Latin: \"Praefectura Praetorio Orientis\") was also formed, including most of the Eastern Roman Empire, from the Thrace eastwards; its easternmost part was the original \"Diocese of the Orient\", corresponding roughly to the region of Syria. \n\nOver time, the common understanding of \"the Orient\" has continually shifted eastwards, as European people traveled farther into Asia. It finally reached the Pacific Ocean, in what Westerners came to call \"the Far East\". These shifts in time and identification sometimes confuse the scope (historical and geographic) of Oriental Studies. Yet there remain contexts where \"the Orient\" and \"Oriental\" have kept their older meanings (e.g., \"Oriental spices\" typically are from the regions extending from the Middle East to sub-continental India to Indo-China). Travelers may again take the Orient Express train from Paris to its terminus in the European part of Istanbul, a route established in the early 20th century.\n\nIn European historiography, the meaning of \"the Orient\" changed in scope several times. Originally, the term referred to Egypt, the Levant, and adjoining areas. as far west as Morocco. During the 1800s, India, and to a lesser extent China, began to displace the Levant as the primary subject of Orientalist research. By the mid-20th century, Western scholars generally considered \"the Orient\" as just East Asia, Southeast Asia, and eastern Central Asia. As recently as the early 20th century, the term \"Orient\" often continued to be used in ways that included North Africa. Today, the term primarily evokes images of China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Mongolia, and peninsular Southeast Asia. Throughout the history of the changing sense of the term, \"the Orient\" was never equivalent to Asia as a whole. \"The Orient\" being largely a cultural term, large parts of Asia—Siberia most notably—were excluded from the scholarly notion of \"the Orient\".\n\nEqually valid terms for the Orient still exist in the English language in such collocations as Oriental studies (now Asian Studies in some countries).\n\nThe adjectival term Oriental has been used by the West to mean cultures, peoples, countries, Asian rugs, and goods from the Orient. \"Oriental\" means generally \"eastern\". It is a traditional designation (especially when capitalized) for anything belonging to the Orient or \"East\" (for Asia), and especially of its Eastern culture. It indicated the eastern direction in historical astronomy, often abbreviated \"Ori\". In contemporary American English, \"Oriental\" usually refers to things from the parts of East Asia traditionally occupied by East Asians and most Central Asians and Southeast Asians racially categorized as \"Mongoloid\". This excludes Jews, Indians, Arabs, and most other South or West Asian peoples. Because of historical discrimination against Chinese, Korean and Japanese, in some parts of the United States, some people consider the term derogatory. For example, Washington state prohibits the word \"Oriental\" in legislation and government documents, preferring the word \"Asian\" instead.\n\nIn more local uses, \"oriental\" is also used for eastern parts of countries, for example Morocco's Oriental Region. Oriental is also used as an adjective akin to \"eastern\", especially in the Spanish-speaking world. For example, the Philippine islands of Mindoro and Negros are each divided into two provinces whose titles include the words \"oriental\" and \"occidental\" respectively. The official name of Uruguay is the República Oriental del Uruguay or Oriental Republic of Uruguay because it is east of the Uruguay River.\n\nSince the 19th century, \"orientalist\" has been the traditional term for a scholar of Oriental studies; however, the use in English of \"Orientalism\" to describe academic \"Oriental studies\" is rare: the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" cites only one such usage, by Lord Byron in 1812. Orientalism is more widely used to refer to the works of the many 19th-century artists who specialized in \"Oriental\" subjects, often drawing on their travels to North Africa and Western Asia. Artists as well as scholars were already described as \"Orientalists\" in the 19th century. In 1978, Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said published his influential and controversial book, \"Orientalism\"; he used the term to describe a pervasive Western tradition, both academic and artistic, of prejudiced outsider interpretations of the Arab and Muslim worlds, shaped by the attitudes of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nIn British English, the term \"Oriental\" is sometimes used to refer to people from East and Southeast Asia (such as those from China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mongolia and Laos). \"Asian\" in Great Britain and Ireland generally refers to people that come from South Asia (in particular Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Maldives) since British Asians make up approximately 6.9% of the population within the United Kingdom. \"Orientals\" refers exclusively to people of East and Southeast Asian origin, who comprise 0.7% of the UK population as a whole, and 5.3% of the non-European population. Of these, the majority are of Chinese descent. \"Orient\" is also a word for the lustre of a fine pearl. Hong Kong, a former British colony, has been called \"Pearl of the Orient\".\n\nDistinct within American culture, some American English speakers consider the term \"Oriental\" to be a pejorative and disparaging term when used to describe a person. John Kuo Wei Tchen, director of the Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program and Institute at New York University, said the basic critique of the term developed in the U.S. in the 1970s. Tchen has said: \"With the U.S.A. anti-war movement in the '60s and early '70s, many Asian Americans identified the term 'Oriental' with a Western process of racializing Asians as forever opposite 'others'.\" In a 2009 American press release related to legislation aimed at removing the term \"oriental\" from official documents of the State of New York, Governor David Paterson said: \"The word 'oriental' does not describe ethnic origin, background or even race; in fact, it has deep and demeaning historical roots\".\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama signed legislation striking the word from federal law.\n\nIn Australian English, the term \"Asian\" generally refers to people of East Asian or Southeast Asian descent, such as those of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, or Filipino descent. Persons of Pakistani, Sri Lankan, and most other South Asian descent are referred to by their respective demonym, but without explicit knowledge, those people are indeterminately inferred as \"Indian\".\n\nIn German, \"Orient\" is usually used synonymously with the area between the Near East and India, including Israel, the Arab world, and Greater Persia.\n\nThe term \"Asiaten\" (English: Asians) means the people of East Asia and Southeast Asia. Another word for Orient in German is \"Morgenland\" (now mainly poetic), which literally translates as \"morning land\". The antonym \"Abendland\" (rarely: \"Okzident\") is also mainly poetic, and refers to (Western) Europe.\n\n\n\n"}

His father was Dmitriy Pavlovich Golohvastov. Pavel graduated from the Page Corps. In 1857–1858, he worked in the Main Archive of the Minister of Internal Affairs; in 1858–1859, he served in the Asian department. Later, he served as a justice of the peace in Zvenigorodsky uyezd, and then was a managing director of Tashinskiy iron plant.\n\nIn 1882, Pavel started his service as an official \"for special orders\" in the Minister of Internal Affairs under the direction of Nikolay Ignatyev. At that time he was already a well-known authoritative theoretic of Slavophilia. Together with another notable slavophile, Ivan Aksakov, he participated in the preparation of the project of emperor's manifest that should have reanimated Zemsky Sobor. This project made Konstantin Pobedonostsev furious, which immediately forced the resignations of both Golohvastov and the minister.\n\nSince a young age, Golohvastov studied the history of the Russian people, especially the period of the Time of Troubles. His legacy includes extensive works (manuscripts mostly), many of which are about Zemsky Sobor. He published several articles in Russky Arkhiv magazine and in the publications of Ivan Aksakov. He was the author of the drama \"Alesha Popovich, a performance in 5 acts based on the Russian fairy tales\" (Moscow, 1869), which was warmly accepted by critics and made him famous among contemporary writers. According to Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, the language he used in his works was heavy, with the strong inclination towards \"samokovannii\" (Russian: самокованный, self-forged) words.\n\nGolohvastov married Olga Andreevna Andreevskaya (1840–1897), an illegitimate daughter of Evdokiya Rostopchina and Andrey Karamzin (colonel, a son of Nikolay Karamzin, 1814–1854). She was brought up in Switzerland, in the family of a priest. Olga was close to the community of slavophiles too. As a writer, she was an author of a few psychological plays.\n\n"}

Single context planning developed by the Museum of London has become the professional norm. The basic advantage of single context planning is context plans draw on \"transparent perma-trace paper\" can be overlaid for re-interpretation at a later date. \n\n\"Multi-context Plans\" as opposed to single context plans can be made of complete sites, trenches or individual features. In the United Kingdom, the scale of the plans is usually 1:20. They are linked to the site recording system by the inclusion of known grid points and height readings, taken with a dumpy level or a total station (see surveying). Excavation of a site by the removal of human made deposits in the reverse order they were created is the preferred method of excavation and is referred to as stratigraphic area excavation \"in plan\" as opposed to excavation \"in section\". Plan and section drawings have an interpretive function as well as being part of the recording system, because the draughts-person makes conscious decisions about what should be included or emphasised.\n\nIt is common and good practice on excavations to lay out a grid of 5m squares so as to facilitate planning. This grid is marked out on-site with grid pegs that form the baselines for tapes and other planning tools to aid the drawing of plans. It is also common practice that planning is done for each context on a separate piece of perma-trace that conforms to these 5m grid squares. This is part of the single context recording system \"(see Fig 1.)\" The site grid should be tied into a national geomatic database such as the Ordnance survey\n\nArchaeological planners use various symbols to denote characteristics of features and contexts and while conventions vary depending on practitioner, the following are representative:\n\nOn sites with little stratigraphic depth, a pre-excavation multi-context plan is sometimes made of all visible features before any excavation is carried out. This helps in planning strategy since problems of stratigraphy on rural sites are minimal as features often cut into the natural minimizing issues of inter-cutting features. Conversely, planning a multi-context urban site is difficult to achieve on a multi-context plan as the features and deposits when planned will obscure each other on the same planning sheet.\n\nPre-excavation plans have been critiqued as being of limited use on urban or deeply stratified sites and have also been attacked in professional archaeology where they have been described as a misused tool of the unscrupulous operators to give the impression the archaeological record for a given site has been dealt with adequately.\n\nThis critical point of view contends, that comparisons between pre and post-excavation plans can demonstrate that a site has not been comprehensively excavated on the basis of a pre-ex plan alone. In many cases there is a pronounced difference between the two phases of planning. Although many features may be visible at ground level following machining, it is often the case that the true limits of features are not so initially discernible until the area of the feature is fully cleaned and subsequently excavated revealing further features and relationships lower in the sequence.\n\n"}

The catastrophe destroyed a more advanced civilization, forcing its terrified population to seek shelter in caves. As cave-dwellers, they lost all knowledge of art, literature, music, philosophy, and engineering. \n\nHe cites as evidence 900-foot-deep cracks radiating outward from the Great Lakes, and stretching for many miles away. He admits it has been proposed that ice-sheets caused these cracks, but suggests that this explanation is improbable, likening them instead to \"cracks in a window which has been struck with a stone\". If ice sheets could produce such cracks, he asks, why haven't similar cracks been found anywhere else on the globe? He adds to this a discussion of surface rocks in New York City, which seem to have undergone a radical chemical change—the feldspar has been converted into slate and the mica has separated out from the iron, as if they had undergone tremendous heat and pressure, as they likely would in the event that a comet struck the earth. He rules out other theories that could have caused this, such as nitric acid and warm rains, by stating that this is an isolated incident, whereas warm rains can occur at any time and place and there's no archaeological evidence for the nitric acid's origins. \n\nHe indicates many legends and myths from various cultures, such as Zoroastrian, Pictish, Hindu, and Ancient Greece, that are all suggestive of a comet striking the earth, the earth catching fire, poisonous gases choking people, and floods and tidal waves swamping large areas. He also discusses early culture's tendency to heliotheism, which he said evolved from gratitude to the Sun, after so many horrific days without it.\n\n\n"}

The Providence Journal called \"Bullough’s Pond\" \"a masterpiece,\" and Publishers Weekly called it \"lyrical\". The Massachusetts Center for the Book awarded the 2001 Massachusetts Book Award to Bullough's Pond for the author’s \"engaging and accomplished storytelling.\"\n\nMuir makes a complex, Malthusian argument for the origin of an industrial revolution in New England independent of the English industrial revolution. Demonstrating that the economic model of colonial New England was large families of children on small-hold farms, producing sufficient wealth not only to live comfortably but to enable all of the children to purchase farms, she argues that a crunch point was reached when cheap, unsettled land ceased to be available. Focusing on the decades following 1790, she argues that families had accumulated wealth to set their children up on farms, but that land was not available until after the federal government broke the armed strength of Tecumseh in the Ohio country. During that twenty-year period, she demonstrates the development of numerous innovative techniques in the early stages of Interchangeable parts manufacturing and precision tool manufacturing, the aspects of industrialization in which southern New England was to lead the world.\n\nMuir argues that, \"The Agricultural Revolution saved hunters and gatherers from starving after they wiped out their bigger prey and populations grew too big to be supported by remaining food supplies. The Industrial Revolution saved the Yankees from poverty, but it depended on fossil energy, the by-products of which are polluting the earth. Muir thus argues that a Third Revolution is now necessary, one that will entail the discovery and deployment of new kinds of energy and materials.\"\n\nMuir's most innovative argument is her tracing of the origins of Mass production manufacturing using Interchangeable parts to Eli Terry and the early Connecticut clock industry. She outlines a chain of transmission from Terry's mass production of wooden clockworks, through clockmaker Elisha Cheney to Simeon North, early mass-production gunmaker and inventor of the earliest milling machine capable of working metal.\n\nMuir’s treatment of Native Americans follows William Cronon’s understanding of native cultures as agents of change who interacted with the ecosystems they inhabited in complex ways. Her innovation here is the use of archaeological data to argue that the Iroquois expansion onto Algonquian lands was checked by the Algonquian adoption of agriculture enabling them to support populations large enough to include a body of warriors that could hold back the threat of Iroquois conquest.\n\n“With New England as the frame of her loom, Diana Muir has used a single shuttle--the dynamic of increasing human population and finite natural resources --to weave the economic and environmental stories of the past four centuries in this corner of North America. Reflections in Bullough's Pond: Economy and Ecosystem in New England suggests that the region has, repeatedly, reached and then exceeded the population that could be sustained by then-current economic subsistence strategies. It illuminates how New Englanders, from indigenous inhabitants to contemporary denizens, have answered the population-resource dilemma and, in doing so, generated both intentional outcomes and unintended – and potent – consequences.” Individual sections are devoted to farming, and to the machine tool and papermaking industries.\n\n\n"}

Hills\n\nRichard Leslie Hills MBE (born 1 September 1936) is an English historian and clergyman who has written extensively on the history of technology, particularly steam power. He founded Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry.\n\nHe was born on 1 September 1936 at Lee Green, Middlesex, the second son of Leslie Hills and Margaret Magalen Miller (the youngest daughter of John Ontario Miller).\n\nHe currently lives near Hyde in Cheshire.\n\nHills was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to industrial heritage.\n\n\nFrom an early age, he was fascinated with mechanical toys, whether making model aircraft on the nursery window sill, arranging layouts for model trains or taking clocks to pieces. At school, he started making a 3½ inch gauge live steam model of the 1830 \"Invicta\" or \"Canterbury Lamb\" which he was now trying to finish. In National Service, he obtained a commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, ending up with the 26 Field Regiment at Folkestone during the Suez Crisis. He was sent to Lydd-on-Sea to supervise the accommodation for Territorial units practising shooting on the Dungeness ranges. Mechanical interests at this time covered as well as the guns a small 2-stroke Excelsior motor bike and a small Standard car which needed a great deal of restoration.\n\nThen followed the History Tripos at Cambridge and the acquisition of a 1924 Lancia Lambda. Through the need to restore this, he was introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Kenny who were prepared to allow impecunious students use of their workshop facilities near Long Melford. They were trying to preserve the steam engine at Stretham that once drained the Waterbeach Level. Recovery from a climbing accident gave me the opportunity to research the history of this engine and the Fen area. After completing the Dip. Ed. at Cambridge followed by a brief teaching spell, a years research into fen drainage at the Imperial College, London, led to the award of its Diploma and the publication of his first book, \"Machines, Mills and Uncountable Costly Necessities\".\n\nThrough the support of Prof. Rupert Hall at Imperial, Donald Cardwell offered him a post of Research Assistant in his History of Science Department at the UMIST to study the History of Textile Technology as well as assisting in launching a science museum for Manchester. The proposed museum was supported by the City of Manchester, the University of Manchester and UMIST. In 1967, UMIST purchased 97 Grosvenor Street for demolition but agreed to allow one part of it to be used temporarily to start the museum. In 1968, the three authorities found between them £12,670 p.a. to fund a lecturer in charge, two technicians and a secretary was well as all the other running costs. Because he had been collecting exhibits such as the Beyer, Peacock archives of their locomotive production and many more, He was offered the post of lecturer in charge. The first stage of the museum was opened on 20 October 1969 by Hervey Rhodes, Baron Rhodes of Saddleworth, Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire. It contained displays of steam and internal combustion engines, papermaking, printing, spinning and weaving, scientific instruments, clocks, electrical exhibits such as wireless sets, archives and much more.\n\nHis Chief Technician was Frank Wightman, an experienced millwright, with a passion for the steam engines that drove the textile mills. Manchester had been a centre for mechanical engineering with many internationally famous firms. He realised that it would be possible to find small examples of machine tools like lathes or planing machines to show the basic principles. Also many textile machines might be shortened to just a few spindles. These would be easier to demonstrate. So he decided to concentrate on mill engines of medium size that would still be impressive. These could be demonstrated under steam from a modern package boiler.\n\nBut this placed him in a dilemma even before the official opening. Should they concentrate our efforts on that or collecting exhibits they could not display immediately but would be necessary in a permanent museum? When they were offered a steam beam engine of around 1830 like those that would have driven the first cotton spinning mills, he decided to use Frank's expertise and dismantle it for storage. Likewise he decided to accept the offer of one of the last steam mill engines ever built, the 1925 Galloway engine from Elm Street Mill, Burnley which required all of Frank's skills to remove it. This had to go into three different stores before the time came to re-erect it in 1983. In 1972, the museum was able to expand into the whole of 97 Grosvenor Street so as many as possible of the exhibits were put into working order and demonstrated especially on Working Saturdays which attracted many visitors. Between the opening in 1969 and closure of Grosvenor Street in 1983, over half a million visitors passed through its doors.\n\nThe celebration of the 150th anniversary of the opening in 1830 of the Liverpool & Manchester Railway saw the acquisition of the original terminus at Liverpool Road, Manchester, by the Greater Manchester Council, and the decision to move the museum into that historic site. At last it became possible to take the mill engines out of store. Frank Wightman had passed on, leaving him as the only person who had seen them in their original situations. He had to supervise first the preparation of plans for the construction of foundations then the actual erection of the mass of separate parts. The total weight must have been around 400 tons. For these engines to run again, there had to be installed services such as steam, water, condensing apparatus, drains as well as overhead cranes. It is probably the most complex display attempted for a museum. The Power Hall has been a major draw for visitors ever since, still being the most popular part of the museum.\n\nAt Liverpool Road, the opportunity was taken to expand into railway related exhibits. He saw that they could complement the National Railway Museum by displaying locomotives that had been exported overseas by the many local locomotive building firms. A cousin, Elspeth Quayle, who was a member of the Manx House of Keys, introduced him to their Minister of Transport and so was arranged the return to Manchester of the Beyer, Peacock built \"Pender\". The sectioning of this locomotive has proved to be another big draw. The British Overseas Railways Historical Society helped with the return of the Vulcan Foundry 4-4-0 locomotive from Pakistan. The Netherlands State Railways presented the high-speed electric EM2 Class \"Ariadne\" built at Gorton with Metropolitan-Vickers electrics. It was designed originally to work between Manchester and Sheffield and then on to London when that part of the line might be electrified. Perhaps his greatest achievement was securing and organising the return of the mighty Beyer, Peacock 'GL' Class Garratt articulated locomotive from South Africa. The logistics of moving this 120 ton monster from Johannesburg to Manchester were considerable, involving a visit by him to that country.\n\nBy this time in 1983, he was feeling the stress of many years overworking. So he took early retirement on ill-health grounds which gave two opportunities. One was to be trained to serve in the Church of England as an ordained priest and he have continued to help in local churches in the Mottram deanery. The other was to contribute more books and articles on the history of technology. These are listed in the bibliography. In the meantime, the museum has continued to expand and develop, becoming Manchester's chief visitor attraction. Since the opening at Liverpool Road in 1983, there have been around two and a half million visitors and in 2013 alone there were 643,000 visitors, drawn by the many working exhibits, the tradition started at Grosvenor Street\n\nRichard married Bernice Pickford (née Parkinson) in August 2008 at the Church where they met and where he was curate, St Michael & all Angels, Mottram in Longdendale.

The fall of Singapore was the largest surrender in British military history.\n\nThe Japanese Indian Ocean raid was a naval sortie by the Fast Carrier Strike Force of the Imperial Japanese Navy from 31 March to 10 April 1942 against Allied shipping and bases in the Indian Ocean. Following the destruction of the ABDACOM forces in the battles around Java in February and March, the Japanese sortied into the Indian Ocean to destroy British seapower there and support the invasion of Burma. The raid was only partially successful. It did not succeed in destroying Allied naval power in the Indian Ocean but it did force the British fleet to relocate from British Ceylon to Kilindini near Mombasa in Kenya, as their more forward fleet anchorages could not be adequately protected from Japanese attack. The fleet in the Indian Ocean was then gradually reduced to little more than a convoy escort force as other commitments called for the more powerful ships. From May 1942, it was also used in the invasion of Madagascar — an operation aimed at thwarting any attempt by Japan to use bases on the Vichy French controlled territory.\n\nIn 1942, Madras City was attacked by a Mitsubishi Rufe, (the Zero's seaplane version) operating from the carrier which dropped a single bomb near the St. George Fort. The physical damage was negligible, though the public response was major and the city was evacuated because of fears of subsequent Japanese bombing and invasion. Many rich families from Madras moved permanently to the hill stations in fear.\n\nAlso in 1942 in preparation for a possible Japanese invasion of India, the British began improvements to the Kodaikanal-Munnar Road to facilitate its use as an evacuation route from Kodaikanal along the southern crest of the Palani Hills to Top Station. Existing roads then continued to Munnar and down to Cochin where British ships would be available for evacuation out of India.\n\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands (8,293 km² on 139 islands) are a group of islands situated in the Bay of Bengal at about 780 miles from Kolkata (known at the time as Calcutta), 740 miles from Chennai (known at the time as Madras) and 120 miles from Cape Nargis in Burma. On 23 March 1942 a Japanese invasion force seized the islands and occupied them until the end of the war.\n\nOn 29 December 1943, political control of the islands was theoretically passed to the Azad Hind government of Subhas Chandra Bose. Bose visited Port Blair to raise the tricolour flag of the Indian National Army. After Bose's departure the Japanese remained in effective control of the Andamans, and the sovereignty of the \"Arzi Hukumat-e Hind\" was largely fictional. The islands themselves were renamed \"Shaheed\" and \"Swaraj\", meaning \"martyr\" and \"self-rule\" respectively. Bose placed the islands under the governorship of Lt Col. A. D. Loganathan, and had limited involvement with the administration of the territory.\n\n\n\nOne of the major logistical efforts of the war was \"flying the Hump\" over the Himalayas and the building of the Ledo Road from India to China as a replacement for the Burma Road.\n\n\nRAF battle honours:\nQualification: For operations against Japanese aircraft and naval units by squadrons based in Ceylon during the Japanese attacks of April 1942.\nQualification: For operations during the 14th Army's advance from Imphal to Rangoon, the coastal amphibious assaults, and the Battle of Pegu Yomas, August 1944 to August 1945.\n\nThe earliest successes were gained by mine laying and submarine warfare. The Japanese minesweeping capability was never great, and when confronted with new types of mines they did not adapt quickly. Japanese shipping was driven from the Burmese coast using this type of warfare. British submarines based in British Ceylon operated against Japanese shipping.\n\nIt was only after the war in Europe was clearly coming to an end that large British forces were dispatched to the Indian Ocean again. Following the neutralisation of the German fleet in late 1943 and early 1944, forces from the Home Fleet were released, and the success of Operation Overlord in June meant even more craft could be sent, including precious amphibious assault shipping.\n\nDuring late 1944, as more British aircraft carriers came into the area a series of strikes were flown against oil targets in Sumatra, such as Operation Meridian. was lent for the first attack by the United States. The oil installations were heavily damaged by the attacks, aggravating the Japanese fuel shortages due to the American blockade. The final attack was flown as the carriers were heading for Sydney to become the British Pacific Fleet.\n\nAfter the departure of the main battle forces the Indian Ocean was left with escort carriers and older battleships as the mainstay of its naval forces. Nevertheless, during those months important operations were launched in the recapture of Burma, including landings on Ramree and Akyab and near Rangoon.\n\nAt the start of the war the British had two commands with responsibilities for possessions in the theatre. India Command under General Sir Archibald Wavell the Commander-in-Chief (CinC) of the Army of India and the Far East Command, first under Air Chief Marshal Robert Brooke-Popham and then from 23 December 1941 commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Royds Pownall.\n\nIndia Command was responsible for British India, British Ceylon, and for some of the time Burma. The Far East Command based in Singapore was responsible for Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore and other British Far East possessions including, for some of the time, Burma.\n\nA month after the outbreak of war with Japan on 7 December 1941, the Allied governments jointly appointed the British Commander-in-Chief (CinC) of the Army of India, General Sir Archibald Wavell, as Supreme Allied Commander of all \"American-British-Dutch-Australian\" (ABDA) forces in South East Asia and the Pacific, from Burma to the Dutch East Indies.\n\nHowever, advances made by the Japanese over the next month split the ABDA forces in two. After transferring the forces in Burma to the India Command, on 25 February 1942 Wavell resigned as commander of the ABDA and resumed his position of CinC of the Army of India. Responsibility for the South West Pacific Area passed to US General Douglas MacArthur as \"Supreme Allied Commander South West Pacific\".\n\nFrom February 1942 until November 1943 the India Command was responsible for the South East Asian Theatre. General Wavell was made Viceroy of India and General Claude Auchinleck became Commander-in-Chief of the India Command on 20 June 1943. In August 1943 the Allies formed a new South East Asian Command to take over strategic responsibilities for the theatre.\n\nThe reorganisation of the theatre command took about two months. On 4 October Winston Churchill appointed Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten supreme Allied commander of the South East Asia Command (SEAC). The American General Joseph Stilwell was the first deputy supreme Allied commander. On 15 November, Auchinleck handed over responsibility for the conduct of operations against the Japanese in the theatre to Mountbatten.\n\nThe initial land forces operational area for SEAC included India, Burma, British Ceylon and Malaya. Operations were also mounted in Japanese-occupied Sumatra, Thailand and French Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos).\n\nInitially SEAC commanded:\n\nIn October 1944, CBI was split into US Forces China Theater (USFCT) and India-Burma Theater (USFIBT).\n\nOn 12 November 1944 Eleventh Army Group redesignated by Allied Land Forces South East Asia (ALFSEA) combining Commonwealth and US forces, with an HQ at Kandy. On 1 December ALFSEA HQ moved to Barrackpore, India.\n\nOn 15 August 1945 responsibility for the rest of the Dutch East Indies was transferred from the South West Pacific Area to SEAC.\n\nSEAC was disbanded on 30 November 1946.\n\nBritish 11th Army Group ( November 1943 – 12 November 1944) was on paper the main Commonwealth army force in South East Asia which directed\n\nOn 12 November 1944 the 11th Army Group was redesignated Allied Land Forces South East Asia, still under SEAC, because it was felt that an inter-Allied command was better than the purely British headquarters. Command problems with General Stilwell and his interactions with the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff had precipitated the change.\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Army Unit controlling all army land and air units in South East Asia and the South West Pacific was the Southern Expeditionary Army headquartered in Saigon, Indochina. It was commanded by General Count Hisaichi Terauchi, who commanded it from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese also deployed the South Seas Force, a combined force of Army and Special Naval Landing Force personnel. The Southern Army's major field commands were the 14th Army, the 15th Army, the 16th Army and the 25th Army. These consisted of 11 infantry divisions, six independent infantry brigades, and six tank regiments, plus artillery and support troops. The Japanese extensively used bicycle infantry, which allowed them quick movement over vast distances.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "886298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=886298", "title": "UK underground", "text": "UK underground\n\nThe British counter-culture or underground scene developed during the mid 1960s, and was linked to the hippie and subculture of the United States. Its primary focus was around Ladbroke Grove and Notting Hill in London. It generated its own magazines and newspapers, bands, clubs and alternative lifestyle, associated with cannabis and LSD use and a strong socio-political revolutionary agenda to create an alternative society.\n\nMany in the blossoming underground movement were influenced by 1950s Beatnik Beat generation writers such as William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, who paved the way for the hippies and the counterculture of the 1960s. During the 1960s, the Beatnik writers engaged in symbiotic evolution with freethinking academics including experimental psychologist Timothy Leary.\n\nAn example of the cross-over of beatnik poetry and music can be seen when Burroughs appeared at the Phun City festival, organised in 24–26 July 1970 by Mick Farren with underground community bands including The Pretty Things, the Pink Fairies, the Edgar Broughton Band and, from the United States, the MC5.\n\nThe UK's underground movement was focused on the Ladbroke Grove/Notting Hill area of London, which Mick Farren said \"was an enclave of freaks, immigrants and bohemians long before the hippies got there\". It had been depicted in Colin MacInnes' novel \"Absolute Beginners\", about street culture at the time of the Notting Hill Riots in the 1950s.\n\nThe underground paper \"International Times\" (IT) began to appear in 1966 and Steve Abrams, founder of \"Soma\", summarised the underground as a \"literary and artistic avant-garde with a large contingent from Oxford and Cambridge. John Hopkins (Hoppy), a member of the editorial board of \"International Times\" for example, was trained as a physicist at Cambridge.\"\n\nPolice harassment of members of the underground (often referred to as \"freaks\", initially by others as an insult, and later by themselves as an act of defiance) became commonplace, particularly against the underground press. According to Farren, \"Police harassment, if anything, made the underground press stronger. It focused attention, stiffened resolve, and tended to confirm that what we were doing was considered dangerous to the establishment.\"\n\nKey underground (community) bands of the time who often performed at benefit gigs for various worthy causes included Pink Floyd (when they still had Syd Barrett), Soft Machine, Hawkwind, The Deviants (featuring Mick Farren), and Pink Fairies; other key people included, in the late '60s, Marc Bolan, who would leave \"the Grove\" to find fame with T. Rex, and his partner Steve Peregrin Took, who remained in Ladbroke Grove and continued to perform benefit gigs in the anti-commercial ethos of the UK underground.\n\nWithin Portobello Road stood the Mountain Grill, a greasy spoon cafe, which in the late 1960s and early 1970s was frequented by several UK underground artists, including Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies. In 1974 Hawkwind released an album titled \"Hall Of The Mountain Grill\" and Steve Peregrin Took wrote \"Ballad of the Mountain Grill\" (aka \"Flophouse Blues\").\n\nMick Farren said, \n\nThe underground movement was also symbolised by the use of drugs. The types of drugs used were varied and in many cases the names and effects were unknown as The Deviants/Pink Fairies member Russell Hunter, working at \"International Times\" (part of the underground press at the time), recalled. \"People used to send in all kinds of strange drugs and things, pills and powders, stuff to smoke and that. They'd always give them to me to try to find out what they were! [Laughs]\".\n\nPart of the sense of humour of the underground, no doubt partly induced by the effects of both drugs and radical thinking was an enjoyment at \"freakin' out the norms\". Mick Farren recalls actions sure to elicit the required response. \"The band's baroque House of Usher apartment on London's Shaftesbury Avenue had witnessed pre-Raphaelite hippy scenes, like Sandy the bass player (of The Deviants and Pink Fairies), Tony the now and again keyboard player, and a young David Bowie, fresh from Beckenham Arts Lab, sunbathing on the roof, taking photos of each other and posing coyly as sodomites\".\n\nThe image of the underground as manifested in magazines such as \"Oz\" and newspapers like \"International Times\" was dominated by key talented graphic artists, particularly Martin Sharp and the Nigel Waymouth–Michael English team, Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, who fused Alfons Mucha's Art Nouveau arabesques with the higher colour key of psychedelia.\n\nThere was a smaller, less widely spread manifestation from the UK underground termed the \"Overground\", which referred to an explicitly spiritual, cosmic, quasi-religious intent, though this was an element that had always been present. At least two magazines—\"Gandalf's Garden\" (6 issues, 1968–72) and \"Vishtaroon\"—adopted this \"overground\" style. \"Gandalf's Garden\" was also a shop/restaurant/meeting place at World's End, Chelsea. The magazines were printed on pastel paper using multi-coloured inks and contained articles about meditation, vegetarianism, mandalas, ethics, poetry, pacifism and other subjects at a distance from the more wild and militant aspects of the underground. The first issue of \"Gandalf's Garden\" urged that we should \"seek to stimulate our own inner gardens if we are to save our Earth and ourselves from engulfment.\" It was edited by Muz Murray who is now called Ramana Baba and teaches yoga.\n\nThese attitudes were embodied musically in The Incredible String Band, who in 2003 were described as \"holy\" by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, in a foreword for the book \"Be Glad: An Incredible String Band Compendium\" (Helter Skelter Books). He had previously chosen the band's track \"The Hedgehog's Song\" as his only piece of popular music on the radio programme \"Desert Island Discs\"). The critic Ian MacDonald said: \"Much that appeared to be profane in Sixties youth culture was quite the opposite\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1915158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915158", "title": "Vaso Čubrilović", "text": "Vaso Čubrilović\n\nVaso Čubrilović (; 14 January 1897 – 11 June 1990) was a Bosnian Serb scholar and Yugoslav politician. As a teenager, he joined the South Slav student movement known as Young Bosnia and was involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914. His brother, Veljko, was also involved in the plot. Čubrilović was convicted of treason by the Austro-Hungarian authorities and given a sixteen-year sentence; his brother was sentenced to death and executed. Čubrilović was released from prison at war's end and studied history at the universities of Zagreb and Belgrade. In 1937, he delivered a lecture to the Serbian Cultural Club in which he advocated The Expulsion of the Albanians from Yugoslavia. Two years later, he became a history professor at the University of Belgrade. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Čubrilović was arrested by the Germans and sent to the Banjica concentration camp, where he remained imprisoned for much of the war.\n\nAs World War II drew to a close, Čubrilović urged the Yugoslav authorities to expel ethnic minorities (particularly Germans and Hungarians) from the country. At war's end, he became a government minister. In his position as Minister of Agriculture, he pushed for the implementation of agricultural reforms. In his later years, he distanced himself from the Pan Slav, and later nationalist, ideologies of his youth and expressed regret over Franz Ferdinand's assassination. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving participant in the conspiracy to kill the Archduke.\n\nVaso Čubrilović was born in Bosanska Gradiška on 14 January 1897. His was a well known family from the region of Bosanska Krajina. He was a relative of Vaso Vidović, a leader of the 1875–77 Herzegovina Uprising who attended the Congress of Berlin. Čubrilović finished primary school in his hometown. He went on to attend the Tuzla High School but was expelled for refusing to stand during the Austro-Hungarian national anthem. He subsequently enrolled in the sixth class of the Sarajevo High School.\n\nČubrilović had been a member of Young Bosnia prior to the outbreak of World War I. He and his older brother were involved in the conspiracy to assassinate of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914. The younger Čubrilović was the youngest of the conspirators. He was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian authorities in Bosanska Dubica on 3 July. The main conspirators were tried in a military prison in Sarajevo. The state attorney charged twenty-two of the accused with high treason and first-degree murder and three with complicity to commit murder. The trial began on 12 October and lasted until 23 October. Čubrilović was only 17 years and six months old at the time. The Čubrilović brothers, Ivo Kranjčević and Neđo Kerović were defended by the lawyer Rudolf Cistler. At the trial, Čubrilović stated that the mistreatment of South Slavs by the Habsburgs motived him to take part in the plot. \"I can state that the monarchy is ruled by the Germans and the Magyars while the Slavs are oppressed,\" he said. Asked if he identified as a Serb or a Croat, Čubrilović declared himself a Serbo-Croat. \"It means I don't consider myself solely a Serb,\" he explained, \"but that I must work for Croatia as well as for Serbia.\" Though the trial ended on 23 October, sentencing did not occur until five days later. Čubrilović was convicted of treason and given a sixteen-year sentence. He had initially been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. When asked his religious beliefs, he identified as an atheist, prompting the judges to add another three years. A further three were added after he refused to express remorse for the Archduke's death and blamed Austria-Hungary for starting the war. His brother Veljko was sentenced to death and hanged.\n\nČubrilović was initially sent to serve out his sentence in Zenica. On 2 March, he and some of his co-conspirators were relocated to the Möllersdorf military prison, near Vienna. They were re-tried in Travnik on 14 June 1915, and had several years added to their sentences. Čubrilović was subsequently moved back to Möllersdorf. On 13 September 1917, the authorities decided to move almost all the surviving conspirators to Zenica prison. He remained imprisoned in Zenica until the end of the war.\n\nČubrilović completed his high school education in Sarajevo in 1919. First, he enrolled at the University of Zagreb to study history, but later transferred to the University of Belgrade, where he received a Bachelor's degree in history in 1922. In 1929, he obtained his Ph.D at the University of Belgrade with a thesis titled \"The Bosnian Uprising 1875–1878\". In the meantime, he had worked as a history teacher at high schools in Sremska Mitrovica, Sarajevo and Belgrade. The historian Vladimir Ćorović subsequently selected Čubrilović as his personal assistant. In 1934, Čubrilović became a docent at the university. From 1921 to 1939, he was an active member of the Agrarian Party.\n\nIn 1937, Čubrilović delivered a lecture to the Serbian Cultural Club in which he outlined possible methods the Yugoslav government could use to coerce Albanians into leaving Kosovo. Čubrilović argued that the only way to \"deal\" with the Albanians was to use the \"brute force of an organized state\". \"If we do not settle accounts with them,\" he opined, \"in 20–30 years we shall have to cope with a terrible irredentism.\" He was highly critical of government attempts to colonize parts of Kosovo as he felt they were ineffective. Čubrilović also criticized the government for not having seized the opportunity presented by a 1918–21 revolt among Kosovo Albanians to force them out of the region. He stated that the benefits of the forced expulsion of Albanians outweighed any risk since \"a threat to Yugoslav security would be removed\". He reasoned: \"At a time when Germany can expel tens of thousands of Jews and Russia can shift millions of people from one part of the continent to another, the shifting of a few Albanians will not lead to the outbreak of a world war.\" The content of the lecture was preserved in writing, came into the possession of Yugoslavia's military intelligence service and was preserved at the Military Archive in Belgrade. It was not made public until 1988. In the ensuing decades, Albanian historians have referred to it as evidence of a plot to evict Kosovo's Albanian population, usually claiming it was written at the request of the Yugoslav General Staff. However, there is no evidence to this effect. Professor Sabrina P. Ramet doubts the lecture had much influence on the Yugoslav authorities, who were already long committed to seeing Kosovo Albanians leave the province and emigrate to Turkey.\n\nIn 1939, Čubrilović became a professor at the University of Belgrade. In April 1941, the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia, and Čubrilović was arrested by the Gestapo in the coastal town of Risan. From there, he was transferred to Belgrade and imprisoned at the Banjica concentration camp, where he remained for much of the war. Once German forces had been forced out of Serbia, Čubrilović became an advisor to Yugoslavia's new communist leader, Josip Broz Tito. The anti-Serb pogroms of World War II, particularly those orchestrated by the Albanians, again directed Čubrilović's attention to the status of Yugoslavia's national minorities. On 17 November 1944, in Belgrade, Čubrilović presented a memorandum titled \"The Minority Problem in the New Yugoslavia\" () to the communist authorities. In it, he advised Tito's government to expel all of Yugoslavia's Germans, Hungarians, Italians, Romanians and Albanians. Indeed, virtually all ethnic Germans living in the country were forced out, as were many Hungarians and Romanians. \"The minority problem,\" Čubrilović wrote, \"if we don't solve it now, will never be solved.\" At the time, such suggestions did not come across as particularly radical given that they coincided with the mass expulsion of Germans from other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn early 1945, Čubrilović was appointed Minister of Agriculture in Tito's government. In August of that year, he pushed for the implementation of the Law on State Agricultural Farms, which emphasized the need to undertake economic measures that would rebuild and strengthen Yugoslavia's agricultural sector. Čubrilović was later appointed Minister of Forestry. In 1959, he became a correspondent of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU), and in 1961, he was granted full membership. Čubrilović was also a correspondent of the Yugoslav and Bosnian academies of sciences and arts, and a regular member of the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 1976, he became an honorary member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In his later years, Čubrilović distanced himself from the Pan Slav, and later nationalist, ideologies of his youth. Referring to Franz Ferdinand's assassination, he said: \"We destroyed a beautiful world that was lost forever due to the war that followed.\" In 1986, he expressed public disapproval of the SANU memorandum, which argued that Yugoslavia's Serbs were being discriminated against and called for a fundamental reorganization of the state. In 1987, the Yugoslav Presidency awarded Čubrilović the Order of the Yugoslav Star. He died in Belgrade on 11 June 1990, aged 93. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving participant in the conspiracy to kill Franz Ferdinand.\n\n\n"}
