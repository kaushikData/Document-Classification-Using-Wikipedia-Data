They were formed in 1904 at Quetta from Hazara refugees. They were disbanded in 1933.\nhttps://collection.nam.ac.uk/detail.php?acc=1969-06-34-1\n\nThe first contact between the British and the Hazaras was just before the First Afghan War, when some Hazaras served in \"Broadfoot's Sappers\" (British Scouts) from 1839–1840.\nA considerable number of Hazaras had come to India to work as labourers prior, particularly in heavy work such as quarrying. In 1903–1904, however, due to high levels of persecution by the Afghans, large numbers of Hazaras refugees poured over the frontier. In 1904, Lord Kitchener, who at that time was Commander-in-Chief in India, directed Major C. W. Jacob to raise a battalion of Hazara Pioneers. Prior to this, the only Hazaras in the Indian Army were those enlisted in the 124th and 126th Baluchistan Infantry, as well as a troop in the Guides Cavalry.\nThe 106th Hazara Pioneers were raised at Quetta in 1904 by Major C. W. Jacob; a nucleus was formed by drafts from the 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry and the 126th Baluchistan Infantry. The Battalion was composed of eight companies of Hazaras, and their permanent peace station was at Quetta. Their full dress uniform was drab with red facings.\n\nIn 1918 the Hazaras of the 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan and the 126th Baluchistan Infantry were transferred to the 106th Hazara Pioneers, then assigned to active service in the Mesopotamia Campaign. The 106th Hazara Pioneers were now the only unit in the Indian Army enlisting Hazaras nationals.\n\nThere were two changes in the title of the regiment after the 1914–1918 war. The 106th Hazara Pioneers became 1st Battalion 4th Pioneers in 1922 and \"The Hazara Pioneers\" in 1929. As a result of the financial crisis in 1933, all Pioneer Regiments in the Indian Army, including the Hazara Pioneers, were disbanded.\n\nFollowing the 1914–1918 war, it became increasingly difficult to recruit Hazaras from the Hazarajat; more recruits had to be taken from the Hazaras colonies settled in the Mashhad area. These men, however, lacked many of the best qualities of the Hazaras enlisted directly from the Afghan highlands. The difficulty in obtaining more of the latter was due chiefly to the change in the attitude of the Afghans towards the Hazaras, who were no longer poorly treated and were now being freely enlisted in the Afghan Army. In addition, the Afghan government had requested the government of India to stop enlisting their subjects (the Hazaras) in the Indian Army.\n\nField Marshal Sir Claud Jacob was colonel of the regiment from 1916 until its disbandment in 1933.\nIn 1915, one company served with distinction in France with the 107th Pioneers. The whole regiment was employed during 1915–1916 with the Kalat Column, and at Khwash in Sistan under General Dyer. In 1917 they served on the Mohmand Blockade Line, and sent one company to join the 128th Pioneers in Mesopotamia.\n\nIn 1918, the whole regiment proceeded to Mesopotamia where, after serving for some months with the 18th Indian Division on the Tigris above Baghdad, they joined the 2nd Corps and were employed in helping the drive the railway through the Jabal Hamrin from Table Mountain on the Dajla (Tigris River).\n\nDuring 1919, they worked strenuously on the Shergat-Mosul line of communications. In the autumn of that year they took part in the Kurdistan campaign. In 1920, they were again employed on the Shergat-Mosul lines of communications, completing their labors in 1921 by constructing a new road down the bank of the Tigris from Shergat to Baji. They returned to Quetta in August 1921.\n\nDuring the above operations, several Indian Orders of Merit, as well as a number of Indian Distinguished Service Medals and Indian Meritorious Service Medals, were awarded to Hazaras for gallantry.\n\nDuring the Waziristan campaign (1919–20) of 1923–1924, the Hazara Pioneers took part in the road making through the Baravi Tangi and the Shahur Tangi. Afterward, they helped with the construction of the railway and frontier roads in Zhob.\n\nIn 1917, due to the difficulty of enlisting a sufficient number of Hazaras from Afghanistan, the experiment was made of recruiting Baltis as a temporary measure. A recruiting party from the 106th Hazara Pioneers visited Baltistan in the late autumn of 1917. About 100 recruits were enlisted during 1917–1918 and even brought to Quetta for training, but the war ended before any of them were able to join the regiment overseas. After the armistice, nearly all these Baltis were demobilized and returned to their homes.\n\nIn 1922, the 106th Hazara Pioneers became the 1st Battalion 4th Hazara Pioneers under the new numbering system employed in the British Indian Army, where multi-battalion regiments replaced single-battalion regiments. The 4th Hazara Pioneers were one of four Pioneer units in the 1922 reorganisation, including the 1st Madras Pioneers, 2nd Bombay Pioneers, and 3rd Sikh Pioneers.\n\n"}

While early on in the filming, Bukowski (who also wrote the screenplay) spoke approvingly of Rourke's portrayal; he would later go on to say that he felt the actor overplayed the character.\n\nBukowski's film incarnations have stretched to even foreign lands outside of the United States. In 1981, Italian director Marco Ferrari created \"Tales of Ordinary Madness\", which was based on several of Bukowski's short stories collected in \"The Most Beautiful Woman in Town\". In 1987, a small Belgian film named \"Crazy Love\" was released. The script was co-written by Charles Bukowski and is now considered one of the best films in world cinema dating back to the 1980s\n\nIn 1995 actor Sean Penn (a good friend of Bukowski's) directed his second feature film, an independent piece named \"The Crossing Guard\" starring Jack Nicholson, Robin Wright, and David Morse. The closing credits of the film contain a dedication to Charles Bukowski\n\nIn 2005, a cinematic adaption of his novel \"Factotum\", directed by Bent Hamer and starring Matt Dillon as Henry Chinaski, was released to largely favorable reviews, scoring a 75% \"Fresh Rating\" on the film review site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe 2009 French film \"Cartagena\" () features Sophie Marceau as a quadriplegic woman named Muriel who loves the writings of Bukowski. She has her caregiver, an alcoholic and former boxer named Léo (played by Christopher Lambert), read passages of Bukowski to her, and she often compares Léo's mannerisms and personality to the poet, implying that their similarities are why she hired him in the first place. \n\nCharles Bukowski has left an impression on many musicians throughout the years through his work. Bono, lead singer of the commercially and critically acclaimed Irish rock band U2, credits Bukowski with a part in his love for American literature, saying \"Here was a guy who was like 'Look, I have no time for metaphors. Can we just get straight down to the bone... the marrow of the bone' \". U2 would later pay tribute to Bukowski in \"Dirty Day\", the ninth track off their widely successful album \"Zooropa\".\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter Tom Waits considers Charles Bukowski a huge influence as well. He cites Bukowski's work as \"very musical\" in nature and calls Bukowski \"one of the most colourful and important writers of modern fiction, poetry, prose, in contemporary literature...\". He also cites a Bukowski poem as the inspiration for the song \"Frank's Wild Years\" off his 1983 album \"Swordfishtrombones\". Even their subject matter is similar in structure and content as both Waits and Bukowski write about dark places, sadness, drifters and loneliness. The opening line of Waits's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography also puts the two on similar platforms, reading \"Tom Waits is a gruff-voiced, big-hearted singer/pianist who is to songwriting what Charles Bukowski is to poetry\".\n\nA number of bands have name-dropped Charles Bukowski and his work over the years. American indie rock band Modest Mouse has made two songs that references the writer: one plainly titled \"Bukowski\" and another off their album \"The Lonesome Crowded West\", titled \"Long Distance Drunk\". The Good Life have a track called \"Album of the Year\", from their album also titled \"Album of the Year\", which mentions Charles Bukowski. The Red Hot Chili Peppers mention Bukowski in their song \"Mellowship Slinky in B Major\" off their 1991 album \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\". English alternative rock band The Boo Radleys have a song called \"Charles Bukowski is Dead\" from their 1995 album \"Wake Up!\". The Dogs D'Amour, a rock band from London, England, reference Charles Bukowski and his misadventures in a track called \"Bullet Proof Poet\" off their third studio album \"A Graveyard Full of Empty Bottles\". Dave Alvin has a song named \"Burning in Water Drowning in Flame\" off his 1993 album \"Museum of the Heart\" that also references the writer. The Florida band Hot Water Music takes their name from a Bukowski short story collection of the same name. The British pop-punk group Moose Blood references Bukowski on the track entitled \"Bukowski\" on their album \"I'll Keep You in Mind, From Time to Time\". The 2017 English band Kasabian mention \"reciting Charles Bukowski\" in their song \"You're in love with a Psycho\". The Arctic Monkeys reference Bukowski in their song \"She Looks Like Fun\" on the 2018 album Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino\n\nCharles Bukowski has been depicted on television as well, namely on the Showtime comedy-drama series \"Californication\". The show's main character Hank Moody, played by actor David Duchovny, is an author based in Los Angeles who subscribes to the same kind of lifestyle that Bukowski became known for. The show depicts profuse indulgence of alcoholism, sex and narcotics, which many critics have described as a television adaption of Bukowski's third novel \"Women\". In the ninth episode of the first season, Moody's girlfriend can be seen reading \"Sifting Through the Madness For The World, The Line, The Way: New Poems\", a collection of Bukowski's posthumously-published work.\n\nCharles Bukowski's work and life has also translated into a few plays and theatre pieces as well. \"Barflies\" was created by Scottish-specific theatre group Grid Iron and it centers on Bukowski's literary alter ego and main protagonist, Henry Chinaski. It is said to be based on three short stories, two poems and about a dozen other extracts from Bukowski's work and explores the alcoholism and women in Bukowski's life. Paul Peditto created a play entitled \"Buk: The Life and Times of Charles Bukowski\". The play involves the life and times of a younger and older version of Bukowski's alter ego, Chinanski, sometimes finding the two interacting with each other. During the writing of the play Peditto wrote many letters to Bukowski, and both the playwright and author continued their exchange until Bukowski's death. For the Live Bait Theater-Prop Theatre co-production of the play, the letters where hung in the lobby outside the theater for the audience to read before and after the show. \"B.S.: Bukowski.Sondheim\", an ongoing production created by Joanne Gordon, the artistic director of the California Repertory Company, is set to be released November 2 through December 8, 2012, at the Queen Mary's theatre in Long Beach, California. The work will fuse together the poetry of Bukowski and the music and lyrics of American composer Stephen Sondheim. Both Sondheim and the Bukowski estate have provided their consent for the making of this production and the use of their respective works.\n"}

{"id": "952792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=952792", "title": "English Renaissance", "text": "English Renaissance\n\nThe English Renaissance was a cultural and artistic movement in England dating from the late 15th century to the early 17th century. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late 14th century. As in most of the rest of northern Europe, England saw little of these developments until more than a century later. The beginning of the English Renaissance is often taken, as a convenience, to be 1485, when the Battle of Bosworth Field ended the Wars of the Roses and inaugurated the Tudor Dynasty. Renaissance style and ideas, however, were slow to penetrate England, and the Elizabethan era in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance.\n\nThe English Renaissance is different from the Italian Renaissance in several ways. The dominant art forms of the English Renaissance were literature and music. Visual arts in the English Renaissance were much less significant than in the Italian Renaissance. The English period began far later than the Italian, which was moving into Mannerism and the Baroque by the 1550s or earlier. In contrast, the English Renaissance can only truly be said to begin, shakily, in the 1520s, and it continued until perhaps 1620.\n\nEngland had a strong tradition of literature in the English vernacular, which gradually increased as English use of the printing press became common during the mid 16th century. By the time of Elizabethan literature a vigorous literary culture in both drama and poetry included poets such as Edmund Spenser, whose verse epic \"The Faerie Queene\" had a strong influence on English literature but was eventually overshadowed by the lyrics of William Shakespeare, Thomas Wyatt and others. Typically, the works of these playwrights and poets circulated in manuscript form for some time before they were published, and above all the plays of English Renaissance theatre were the outstanding legacy of the period. The works of this period are also affected by Henry VIII's declaration of independence from the Catholic Church and technological advances in sailing and cartography, which are reflected in the generally nonreligious themes and various shipwreck adventures of Shakespeare.\n\nThe English theatre scene, which performed both for the court and nobility in private performances, and a very wide public in the theatres, was the most crowded in Europe, with a host of other playwrights as well as the giant figures of Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Elizabeth herself was a product of Renaissance humanism trained by Roger Ascham, and wrote occasional poems such as \"On Monsieur's Departure\" at critical moments of her life. Philosophers and intellectuals included Thomas More and Francis Bacon. All the 16th century Tudor monarchs were highly educated, as was much of the nobility, and Italian literature had a considerable following, providing the sources for many of Shakespeare's plays. English thought advanced towards modern science with the Baconian Method, a forerunner of the Scientific Method. The language of the \"Book of Common Prayer\", first published in 1549, and at the end of the period the Authorised Version (\"King James Version\" to Americans) of the Bible (1611) had enduring impacts on the English consciousness.\n\nEngland was very slow to produce visual arts in Renaissance styles, and the artists of the Tudor court were mainly imported foreigners until after the end of the Renaissance; Hans Holbein was the outstanding figure. The English Reformation produced a huge programme of iconoclasm that destroyed almost all medieval religious art, and all but ended the skill of painting in England; English art was to be dominated by portraiture, and then later landscape art, for centuries to come. The significant English invention was the portrait miniature, which essentially took the techniques of the dying art of the illuminated manuscript and transferred them to small portraits worn in lockets. Though the form was developed in England by foreign artists, mostly Flemish like Lucas Horenbout, the somewhat undistinguished founder of the tradition, by the late 16th century natives such as Nicolas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver produced the finest work, even as the best producers of larger portraits in oil were still foreigners. The portrait miniature had spread all over Europe by the 18th century. The portraiture of Elizabeth I was carefully controlled, and developed into an elaborate and wholly un-realist iconic style, that has succeeded in creating enduring images.\n\nEnglish Renaissance music kept in touch with continental developments far more than visual art, and managed to survive the Reformation relatively successfully, though William Byrd and other major figures were Catholic. The Elizabethan madrigal was distinct from, but related to the Italian tradition. Thomas Tallis, Thomas Morley, and John Dowland were other leading English composers.\n\nThe colossal polychoral productions of the Venetian School had been anticipated in the works of Thomas Tallis, and the Palestrina style from the Roman School had already been absorbed prior to the publication of \"Musica transalpina\", in the music of masters such as William Byrd.\n\nThe Italian and English Renaissances were similar in sharing a specific musical aesthetic. In the late 16th century Italy was the musical center of Europe, and one of the principal forms which emerged from that singular explosion of musical creativity was the madrigal. In 1588, Nicholas Yonge published in England the \"Musica transalpina\"—a collection of Italian madrigals that had been Anglicized—an event which began a vogue of madrigal in England which was almost unmatched in the Renaissance in being an instantaneous adoption of an idea, from another country, adapted to local aesthetics. English poetry was exactly at the right stage of development for this transplantation to occur, since forms such as the sonnet were uniquely adapted to setting as madrigals: indeed, the sonnet was already well developed in Italy. Composers such as Thomas Morley, the only contemporary composer to set Shakespeare, and whose work survives, published collections of their own, roughly in the Italian manner but yet with a unique Englishness; interest in the compositions of the English Madrigal School have enjoyed a considerable revival in recent decades.\n\nDespite some buildings in a partly Renaissance style from the reign of Henry VIII, notably Hampton Court Palace, the vanished Nonsuch Palace, Sutton Place and Layer Marney Tower, it was not until the Elizabethan architecture of the end of the century that a true Renaissance style emerged, influenced far more by northern Europe than Italy. The most famous buildings are large show houses constructed for courtiers, and characterised by lavish use of glass, as at \"Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall\", Wollaton Hall and Hatfield House and Burghley House, the style continuing into the early 17th century before developing into Jacobean architecture. Lesser, but still large, houses like Little Moreton Hall continued to be constructed and expanded in essentially medieval half-timbered styles until the late 16th century. Church architecture essentially continued in a late Gothic style until the Reformation, and then stopped almost completely, although church monuments, screens and other fittings often had classical styles from about the mid-century. The few new church buildings were usually still Gothic in style, as in Langley Chapel of 1601.\n\nThe notion of calling this period \"The Renaissance\" is a modern invention, having been popularized by the historian Jacob Burckhardt in the 19th century. The idea of the Renaissance has come under increased criticism by many cultural historians, and some have contended that the \"English Renaissance\" has no real tie with the artistic achievements and aims of the Italian artists (Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Donatello) who are closely identified with Renaissance visual art. Whereas from the perspective of literary history, England had already experienced a flourishing of literature over 200 years before the time of Shakespeare, during the last decades of the fourteenth century. Geoffrey Chaucer's popularizing of English as a medium of literary composition rather than Latin occurred only 50 years after Dante had started using Italian for serious poetry, and Chaucer translated works by both Boccaccio and Petrarch into Middle English. At the same time William Langland, author of \"Piers Plowman\", and John Gower were also writing in English. In the fifteenth century, Thomas Malory (author of \"Le Morte D'Arthur\"), John Lydgate, and Thomas Hoccleve were notable figures. For this reason, scholars find the singularity of the period called the English Renaissance questionable; C. S. Lewis, a professor of Medieval and Renaissance literature at Oxford and Cambridge, famously remarked to a colleague that he had \"discovered\" that there was no English Renaissance, and that if there had been one, it had \"no effect whatsoever\".\n\nHistorians have also begun to consider the word \"Renaissance\" as an unnecessarily loaded word that implies an unambiguously positive \"rebirth\" from the supposedly more primitive Middle Ages. Some historians have asked the question \"a renaissance for whom?,\" pointing out, for example, that the status of women in society arguably declined during the Renaissance. Many historians and cultural historians now prefer to use the term \"early modern\" for this period, a term that highlights the period as a transitional one that led to the modern world, but attempts to avoid positive or negative connotations.\n\nOther cultural historians have countered that, regardless of whether the name \"renaissance\" is apt, there was undeniably an artistic flowering in England under the Tudor monarchs, culminating in Shakespeare and his contemporaries.\n\nMajor literary figures in the English Renaissance include:\n\n\n"}

Ernst Florian Winter attended the humanistic grammar school in the Klostergasse in Währing, after which he attended Neulandschule. He was a member of the Austrian Catholic Bund Neuland. Alfons Stilfried and the brothers Otto and Fritz Molden were in the same group.\n\nWinter accompanied his father, Ernst Karl, very early in his political career. Regularly there were hour-long discussions at their family residences, attended by people such as Alfred Missong, August Maria Knoll, Hans Karl von Zessnerspitzberg, and Engelbert Dollfuss. When federal chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg returned from meeting with Hitler at the Berghof on 12 February 1938, he visited the Winters' home to speak with Ernst Karl Winter. The 14-year-old Ernst Florian Winter kept the minutes of this discussion.\n\nA few days before the Anschluss in March 1938, Ernst Karl Winter fled Austria to Switzerland, for political reasons, at the urging of Hans Kelsen. He had to leave his family behind. When the Gestapo came to the Winters' house and could not find Ernst Karl, they took his son, Ernst Florian, to the police station. Ernst Florian's mother, Margarete, managed to get him released on the same day. A few days later, Margarete, her son Ernst Florian and his six siblings fled from Austria (his youngest sibling was born after the family moved to the United States).\n\nVia Switzerland, France, and England, the Winters emigrated to New York City in October 1939. They were one of the first non-Jewish emigrant families. Because there were no Austrian clubs in New York, many Austrian immigrants met in the Winters' house almost every Sunday. At the beginning of 1939, Ernst Karl Winter founded the Austrian American Center in New York, which was the first non-party national committee. This committee regularly organised demonstrations and marches and released weekly publications. There were almost no juveniles under the emigrants, nevertheless Ernst Florian Winter was voted as the leader. A few dozen juveniles regularly celebrated parades on Fifth Avenue. Together with his father, Ernst Florian met U.S. vice president Henry Wallace.\n\nWinter did not join the \"Österreichische Bataillon\" initiated by Otto von Habsburg, because he had his skiing instructor exam. As a member of the \"Ski Patrol System\" he received a letter from the U.S. minister of war, who planned to set up a mountain division. On his 18th birthday, he joined the U.S. Army, though he wrote on his application form: \"volunteer to join for the liberation of my home country Austria, but I am not willing to kill.\" The main reason of his strict attitude was that he had seen pictures of the Nazi concentration camps at his father's publishing house, which weighed heavily on him. In 1943, Winter gained American citizenship, and in 1944 he earned a degree from the University of Michigan.\n\nWinter took part in the invasion of Normandy. He was the first Austro-American who marched into the Innviertel on 4 May 1945 with the 86th division of the 3rd U.S. Army at Burghausen, where he stayed at the Brauerei Schnaitl.\n\nOn orders from Baron Georg Ludwig von Trapp, Winter had a look at a mansion in Aigen that was the summer residence of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. There he discovered that the house chapel had a swastika carved on the altar. A few weeks after the liberation, Winter had to leave his homeland again. His division went to Japan, where they had similar duties.\n\nAfter Winter had returned to the U.S., he graduated with a degree in social science from Columbia College. Studies in political science and international relations at Columbia University followed. He finished his Master of Arts degree in 1951. His topic was \"Comparative analyses of the Renner-regime 1918 and 1945\". He finished his Ph.D. in 1954; his dissertation topic was \"Austrian agriculture between 1918 and 1945.\"\n\nWinter began his academic career as professor of history and political science at Iona College in New Rochelle, New York. He also served as a visiting professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Princeton University, Georgetown University, and Indiana University.\n\nIn 1960, he returned to Austria to establish the field of study of political science. In 1964, he was chosen by the state secretary Bruno Kreisky to be the foundation director of the Diplomatic University of Vienna, where he served as a professor for decades. He also began work as an assistant at the Institute for Higher Studies (IHS) at its founding in 1963. He was the director of the IHS between 1967 and 1968.\n\nHe was married to Johanna von Trapp (1919–1994), the daughter of Georg Ludwig von Trapp. They were married from 1948 to 1994 and had seven children: Ernst Florian (1949–1969), Johanna, Florian, Notburga, Agathe, Hemma, and Severin. From 1964 to 1977 they lived together in Schloss Eichbüchel in Katzeldorf. There they had the \"Eichbüchler-Gespräche\" and Austria seminars for ten years; visiting professors included Oskar Morgenstern, Paul Lazarsfeld, Friedrich Heer, and Henry Kissinger.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1970, Winter was director of social science at UNESCO in Paris. At the same time, he was chief negotiator between the U.S. and the People's Republic of China. Winter was member of the UN commission of the United States for the development of China strategies between 1970 and 1972. In January 1970 Henry Kissinger sent him to ask Chinese-Canadian academic and political activist Paul Lin to relay a confidential message to Zhou Enlai conveying Kissinger’s desire to meet Chinese leaders in view of a visit by President Nixon to China. In January 1972, he was the first American invited by Chinese prime minister Zhou Enlai to a two-month stay at the institute for foreign politics in China. In 1974, as part of UNEP-FAO, Winter was chairman of the first mission of the UN agency in China. In the following year, he led the China Mission of UNEP-WHO.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, Winter cultivated an organic self-sustaining area in the Deferggental in eastern Tyrol. He participated in an environment program of the United Nations called \"Agriculture in Kosovo\"; as part of that program, he taught at the University of Business and Technology in Priština.\n\nBeginning in 2009, Winter was chairman of the international council of Austrian Service Abroad.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19291269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19291269", "title": "Genealogy (philosophy)", "text": "Genealogy (philosophy)\n\nIn philosophy, genealogy is a historical technique in which one questions the commonly understood emergence of various philosophical and social beliefs by attempting to account for the scope, breadth or totality of discourse, thus extending the possibility of analysis, as opposed to the Marxist use of the term ideology to explain the totality of historical discourse within the time period in question by focusing on a singular or dominant discourse (ideology). Moreover, a genealogy often attempts to look beyond the discourse in question toward the conditions of their possibility (particularly in Foucault's genealogies). It has been developed as continuation of the works of Friedrich Nietzsche. For example, tracking the lineages of a concept such as 'globalization' can be called a 'genealogy' to the extent that the concept is located in its changing constitutive setting. This entails not just documenting its changing meaning (etymology) but the social basis of its changing meaning.\n\nNietzsche criticized \"the genealogists\" in \"On the Genealogy of Morals\" and proposed the use of a historic philosophy to critique modern morality by supposing that it developed into its current form through power relations. But scholars note that he emphasizes that, rather than being purely necessary developments of power relations, these developments are to be exposed as at least partially contingent, the upshot being that the present conception of morality could always have been constituted otherwise. Even though the philosophy of Nietzsche has been characterized as genealogy, he only uses the term in \"On the Genealogy of Morals.\" The later philosophy that has been influenced by Nietzsche, and which is commonly described as genealogy, shares several fundamental aspects of Nietzschean philosophical insight. Nietzschean historic philosophy has been described as \"a consideration of oppositional tactics\" that embraces, as opposed to forecloses, the conflict between philosophical and historical accounts.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, Michel Foucault expanded the concept of genealogy into a counter-history of the position of the subject which traces the development of people and societies through history. His genealogy of the subject accounts \"for the constitution of knowledges, discourses, domains of objects, and so on, without having to make reference to a subject which is either transcendental in relation to the field of events or runs in its empty sameness throughout the course of history.\"\n\nAs Foucault discussed in his essay \"Nietzsche, Genealogy, History\", Foucault's ideas of genealogy were greatly influenced by the work that Nietzsche had done on the development of morals through power. Foucault also describes genealogy as a particular investigation into those elements which \"we tend to feel [are] without history\". This would include things such as sexuality, and other elements of everyday life. Genealogy is not the search for origins, and is not the construction of a linear development. Instead it seeks to show the plural and sometimes contradictory past that reveals traces of the influence that power has had on truth.\n\nAs one of the important theories of Michel Foucault, genealogy deconstructs truth, arguing that truth is, more often than not, discovered by chance, backed up by the operation of Power/knowledge or the consideration of interest. Furthermore, all truths are questionable. Pointing out the unreliability of truth, which is often accused as \"having tendency of relativity and nihilism\", the theory flatly refuses the uniformity and regularity of history, emphasizing the irregularity and inconstancy of truth and toppling the notion that history progresses in a linear order.\n\nThe practice of genealogy is also closely linked to what Foucault called the \"archeological method:\"\n\nIn short, it seems that from the empirical observability for us of an ensemble to its historical acceptability, to the very period of time in which it is actually observable, the analysis goes by way of the knowledge-power nexus, supporting it, recouping it at the point where it is accepted, moving toward what makes it acceptable, of course, not in general, but only where it is accepted. This is what can be characterized as recouping it in its positivity. Here, then, is a type of procedure, which, unconcerned with legitimizing and consequently excluding the fundamental point of view of the law, runs through the cycle of positivity by proceeding from the fact of acceptance to the system of acceptability analyzed through the knowledge-power interplay. Let us say that this is, approximately, the archaeological level [of analysis].\n\n"}

Located in the Semien Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region, Gondar is north of Tana Lake on the Lesser Angereb River and southwest of the Simien Mountains. It has a latitude and longitude of with an elevation of 2133 meters above sea level. It is surrounded by the Gondar Zuria woreda. Gondar served as a strong Christian kingdom for many years. \n\nGondar previously served as the capital of both the Ethiopian Empire and the subsequent Begemder Province. The city holds the remains of several royal castles, including those in Fasil Ghebbi (the Royal Enclosure), for which Gondar has been called the \"Camelot of Africa\".\n\nUntil the 16th century, the Solomonic Emperors of Ethiopia usually had no fixed capital town, but instead lived in tents in temporary royal camps as they moved around their realms while their family, bodyguard and retinue devoured surplus crops and cut down nearby trees for firewood. One exception to this rule was Debre Berhan, founded by Zara Yaqob in 1456; Tegulet in Shewa was also essentially the capital during the first century of Solomonic rule. Gondar was founded by Emperor Fasilides around the year 1635, and grew as an agricultural and market town. There was a superstition at the time that the capital's name should begin with the letter 'Gʷa' (modern pronunciation 'Gʷe'; Gonder was originally spelt Gʷandar), which also contributed to Gorgora's (founded as Gʷargʷara) growth in the centuries after 1600. Tradition also states that a buffalo led the Emperor Fasilides to a pool beside the Angereb, where an \"old and venerable hermit\" told the Emperor he would locate his capital there. Fasilides had the pool filled in and built his castle on that same site. The emperor also built a total of seven churches; the first two, Fit Mikael and Fit Abbo, were built to end local epidemics. The five emperors who followed him also built their palaces in the town. \nBeginning with Emperor Menas in 1559, the rulers of Ethiopia began spending the rainy season near Lake Tana, often returning to the same location each year. These encampments, which flourished as cities for a short time, include Emfraz, Ayba, Gorgora and Dankaz.\n\nIn 1668, as a result of a church council, the Emperor Yohannes I ruled that the inhabitants of Gondar were to be segregated by religion. This caused the Muslims to move into their own quarter, \"Islamge\" (, \"Islam place,\" or \"Islam country\") or \"Islam Bayt\" (እስላምቤት\"House of Islam,\" lit. \"Islam house\"), within two years. This quarter came to be known as Addis Alem (Amharic for \"New World\").\n\nDuring the seventeenth century, the city's population is estimated to have exceeded 60,000. Many of the buildings from this period survive, despite the turmoil of the eighteenth century. By the reign of Iyasu the Great, Gondar had acquired a sense of community identity; when the Emperor called upon the inhabitants to decamp and follow him on his campaign against the Oromo in Damot and Gojjam, as had the court and subjects of earlier emperors, they refused. Although Gondar was by any definition a city, it was not a melting pot of diverse traditions, nor Ethiopia's window to the larger world, according to Donald Levine. \"It served rather as an agent for the quickened development of the Amhara's own culture. And thus it became a focus of national pride... not as a hotbed of alien custom and immorality, as they often regard Addis Ababa today, but as the most perfect embodiment of their traditional values.\" As Levine elaborates in a footnote, it was an orthogenetic pattern of development, as distinguished from an heterogenetic one.\nThe town served as Ethiopia's capital until Tewodros II moved the Imperial capital to Magadala upon being crowned Emperor in 1855; Tewodros II plundered and burnt the city in 1864, then devastated it again in December, 1866. Abdallahi ibn Muhammad sacked Gondar when he invaded Ethiopia June 1887. Gondar was ravaged again on 23 January in the next year, when Sudanese invaders set fire to almost every one of the city's churches.\n\nAfter the military occupation of Ethiopia by the Kingdom of Italy in 1936, Gondar was further developed under Italian occupation, and the Comboni missionaries established in 1937 the Latin Catholic Apostolic Prefecture of Gondar, which would be suppressed after its only prefect's death in 1951.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Mussolini's Italian forces made their last stand in Gondar in November 1941, after Addis Ababa fell to British forces six months before. The area of Gondar was one of the main centers of activity of Italian guerrilla against the British forces until summer 1943.\n\nDuring the Ethiopian Civil War, the forces of the Ethiopian Democratic Union gained control of large parts of Begemder, and during parts of 1977 operated within a few kilometers of Gondar, and appeared to be at the point of capturing the city. As part of Operation Tewodros near the end of the Civil War, Gondar was captured by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front in March 1991.\n\nGondar traditionally was divided into several neighborhoods or quarters: Addis Alem, where the Muslim inhabitants dwelled; Kayla Meda, where the adherents of Beta Israel lived; Abun Bet, centered on the residence of the Abuna, or nominal head of the Ethiopian Church; and Qagn Bet, home to the nobility. Gondar is also a noted center of ecclesiastical learning of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and known for having 44 churches – for many years more than any other settlement in Ethiopia. Gondar and its surrounding countryside constitute the homeland of most Ethiopian Jews.\n\nThe modern city of Gondar is popular as a tourist destination for its many picturesque ruins in Fasil Ghebbi (the Royal Enclosure), from which the emperors once reigned. The most famous buildings in the city lie in the Royal Enclosure, which include Fasilides' castle, Iyasu's palace, Dawit's Hall, a banqueting hall, stables, Empress Mentewab's castle, a chancellery, library and three churches. Near the city lie Fasilides' Bath, home to an annual ceremony where it is blessed and then opened for bathing; the Qusquam complex, built by Empress Mentewab; the eighteenth century Ras Mikael Sehul's Palace and the Debre Berhan Selassie Church.\n\nDowntown Gondar shows the influence of the Italian occupation of the late 1930s. The main piazza features shops, a cinema, and other public buildings in a simplified Italian Moderne style still distinctively of the period despite later changes and, frequently, neglect. Villas and flats in the nearby quarter that once housed occupation officials and colonists are also of interest.\n\nThe town is home to the University of Gondar, which includes Ethiopia's main faculty of medicine.\n\nBased on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), Gondar had a total population of 207,044, of whom 98,120 were men and 108,924 women. The majority of the inhabitants practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 84.2% reporting that as their religion, while 11.8% of the population said they were Muslim and 1.1% were Protestant.\n\nThe 1994 national census reported a total population of 112,249 in 21,695 households, of whom 51,366 were men and 60,883 women. The three largest ethnic groups reported in Gondar Zuria were the Amhara (88.91%), the Tigrayan (6.74%), and the Qemant (2.37%); all other ethnic groups made up 1.98% of the population. Amharic was spoken as a first language by 94.57%, and 4.67% spoke Tigrinya; the remaining 0.76% spoke all other primary languages reported. 83.31% adhered to Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and 15.83% of the population said they were Muslim. Gondar was once the home of a large population of Ethiopian Jews, most of whom immigrated to Israel in the late 20th and early 21st century, including the current Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Belaynesh Zevadia.\n\nAir transport is served by Gondar Airport (ICAO code HAGN, IATA GDQ), also known as Atse Tewodros Airport, after the Emperor of Ethiopia (Atse) Tewodros. It is south of the city.\nTravel within Gondar is mostly done by mini-buses and 3-wheeler motorcycles (accommodating 3-4 passengers).\n\nIntercity bus service is provided by the Selam Bus Line Share Company and Sky Bus Transport System, as well as independently-owned buses that depart from the town bus station.\n\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as humid subtropical (Cwa), bordering with subtropical highland (Cwb).\n\nAs designated by Sister Cities International, Gondar is a sister city with:\n\n\n\n"}

For more than two millennia, it has linked South Asia with Central Asia. It runs from Chittagong, Bangladesh west to Howrah, West Bengal in India, then across Northern India through Delhi, passing from Amritsar. From there, the road continues towards Lahore and Peshawar in Pakistan, finally terminating in Kabul, Afghanistan.\n\nThe route spanning the Grand Trunk (GT) road existed during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya, extending from the mouth of the Ganges to the north-western frontier of the Empire. The predecessor of the modern road was rebuilt by Sher Shah Suri, who renovated and extended the ancient Mauryan route in the 16th century. The road was considerably upgraded in the British period between 1833 and 1860.\n\nIt coincides with current N1 (Chittagong to Dhaka), N4 & N405 (Dhaka to Sirajganj), N507 (Sirajganj to Natore) and N6 (Natore to Rajshai towards Purnea in India) in Bangladesh; NH 12 (Rajshahi to Purnea), NH 27 (Purnea to Patna), NH 19 (Patna to Agra), NH 44 (Agra to Jalandhar via New Delhi, Sonipat, Ambala and Ludhiana) and NH 3 (Jalandhar to Attari, Amritsar towards Lahore in Pakistan) in India; N-5 (Lahore, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Peshawar and Khyber Pass towards Jalalabad in Afghanistan) in Pakistan and AH1 (Torkham-Jalalabad to Kabul) in Afghanistan.\n\nResearch indicates that the Grand Trunk road predated even Buddha's birth and was called Uttara Path, meaning, road to the North. Salman Rashid attributes the Road's construction to Chandragupta Maurya. During the time of the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BCE, overland trade between India and several parts of Western Asia and the Hellenistic world went through the cities of the north-west, primarily Takshashila (in present-day in Pakistan). Takshashila was well connected by roads with other parts of the Maurya empire. The Mauryas had maintained this very ancient highway from Takshashila to Patliputra (present-day Patna in India). Chandragupta Maurya had a whole army of officials overseeing the maintenance of this road as told by the Greek diplomat Megasthenes who spent fifteen years at the Mauryan court. Constructed in eight stages, this road is said to have connected the cities of Purushapura, Takshashila, Hastinapura, Kanyakubja, Prayag, Patliputra and Tamralipta, a distance of around .\nSher Shah however remains the only mentioned person as the builder of what is now the complete stretch of GT Road, which was referred to as \"Shah Rah e Azam\" ( or \"The Great Road\"). During his reign, Caravanserais were built and trees were planted along the entire stretch on both sides of the road to provide shade to travelers. Wells were also dug, especially along the Taxila section. The Mughuls later extended the road further east to Chittagong and west to Kabul and referred to the road as \"Sarak e Azam\" (, also meaning \"The Great Road\").\n\nIn the 1830's the East India Company started a programme of metalled road construction, for both commercial and administrative purposes. The Grand trunk road, from Calcutta, through Delhi, to Peshawar (present-day Pakistan) was rebuilt at a cost of £1000 / mile, and a Public Works Department, and the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee founded, to train and employ local surveyors, engineers, and overseers, to perform the work, and in future maintain it and other roads.\n\nOver the centuries, the road acted as one of the major trade routes in the region and facilitated both travel and postal communication. The Grand Trunk Road is still used for transportation in present-day India, where parts of the road have been widened and included in the national highway system, retaining the old name.\n\nGT Road is mentioned in a number of literary works including those of Foster and Rudyard Kipling. Kipling described the road as: \"Look! Look again! and chumars, bankers and tinkers, barbers and bunnias, pilgrims – and potters – all the world going and coming. It is to me as a river from which I am withdrawn like a log after a flood. And truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle. It runs straight, bearing without crowding India's traffic for fifteen hundred miles – such a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Nasser's tenure as Egypt's leader heralded a new period of modernisation and socialist reform in Egypt and a staunch advocacy of pan-Arab nationalism (including a short-lived union with Syria) and developing world solidarity. His prestige in Egypt and throughout the Arab world soared in the wake of his nationalisation of the Suez Canal in 1956, and Egypt's political victory in the subsequent Tripartite Aggression, but was damaged badly by Israel's successful invasion and occupation of Egyptian and Arab territory in the Six-Day War of 1967.\n\nThe era is regarded as a time where ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment as well as other forms of social welfare, while aristocratic influence waned. The national economy grew significantly through agrarian reform, major modernisation projects such as the Helwan steel works and the Aswan Dam and nationalisation schemes such as that of the Suez Canal. However, the substantial economic growth that marked the early 1960s took a downturn for the remainder of the decade, only recovering in 1970. During Nasser's time in office, Egypt experienced a golden age of culture, particularly in theater, film, poetry, television, radio, literature, fine arts, comedy and music. Egypt under Nasser dominated the Arab world in these fields, producing singers such as Abdel Halim Hafez, Umm Kulthum and Mohammed Abdel Wahab, literary figures such as Naguib Mahfouz and Tawfiq el-Hakim, actors like Faten Hamama and Rushdi Abaza and the release of over 100 films yearly, compared to the production of just more than a dozen annually during Hosni Mubarak's presidency (1981–2011).\n\nOn 22–26 July 1952, the Free Officers, a group of disaffected officers in the Egyptian army founded by Gamal Abdel Nasser and headed by General Muhammad Naguib, initiated the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 which overthrew King Farouk, whom the military blamed for Egypt's poor performance in the 1948 war with Israel and lack of progress in fighting poverty, disease and illiteracy in Egypt. The monarchy of Egypt and Sudan was gone without \"a voice\" being \"raised\" in its favour. In the following two years, the Free Officers consolidated power. Popular expectations for immediate reforms led to the workers' riots in Kafr Dawar on 12 August 1952, which resulted in two death sentences. Following a brief experiment with civilian rule, the Free Officers abrogated the 1953 constitution and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953, Muhammad Naguib as Egypt's first President. Within six months all civilian political parties were banned replaced by the \"Liberation Rally\" government party, the elites seeing a need for a \"transitional authoritarianism\" in light of Egypt's poverty, illiteracy and lack of a large middle class.\n\nIn January, the large Muslim Brotherhood organization was outlawed, remaining an illegal political organization until the Revolution of 2011. The move came in the wake of clashes between members of the Brotherhood and Liberation Rally student demonstrators on 12 January 1954. On 26 October, an assassination attempt suspected by the Brotherhood was directed at Nasser during a rally in Alexandria. This led to the regime acting against the Brotherhood, executing Brotherhood leaders on 9 December.\n\nGamal Abdel-Nasser, first became the chairman of the RCC, then prime minister, and in November 1954 after President Nagib was dismissed from office and placed under house arrest. Nasser, however, would not become President of Egypt until 1956, until which time the office was vacant.\n\nMeanwhile, the RCC, morally backed by both the Soviet Union and the United States, managed to remain united in its opposition to the British and French, specifically in regard to the Suez. Despite continued calls from the RCC, in debates in the United Nations, and pressure from both the US and USSR, the British refused to transfer control of the Canal to the new regime. The RCC began funding and coordinating ever greater attacks on the British and French in the Suez and Damietta. Finally, on 19 October, Nasser signed a treaty for the evacuation of British troops from Egypt, to be completed over the following 20 months. Two years later, on 18 June 1956, Nasser raised the Egyptian flag over the Canal Zone, announcing the complete evacuation of British troops.\n\nPresident Nasser announced a new Constitution on 16 January at a popular rally, setting up a presidential system of government in which the president has the power to appoint and dismiss ministers. An elections law was passed on 3 March granting women the right to vote for the first time in Egyptian history. Nasser was elected as the second president of the Republic on 23 June. In 1957, Nasser announced the formation of the National Union (\"Al-Ittihad Al-Qawmi\"), paving the way to July elections for the National Assembly, the first parliament since 1952.\n\nThe original revolutionaries wanted an end to British occupation but did not have a unified ideology or plan for Egypt. One issue that was agreed on and acted quickly on was land reform. Less than six percent of Egypt's population owned more than 65% of the land in Egypt, while at the top and less than 0.5% of Egyptians owned more than one-third of all fertile land. the process of land reform began on September 11, 1952, when (among many provisions) a law prohibited ownership of more than 200 feddans of land (840000 sq meters); limited the rental rate for land; established cooperatives for farmers; minimum wages, etc.\n\nDuring the presidency of Nasser, cultivated land in Egypt increased by almost a third (an achievement that had reportedly eluded Egyptians for more than a millennium).\n\nEgypt's economy grew at an average rate of 9% per annum for almost a decade. The share of manufacturing to Egypt's GDP rose from around 14% in the late 1940s to 35% by the early 1970s.\n\n\"The combination of the land-reform programme and the creation of the public sector in Egypt resulted in around 75% of Egypt's gross domestic product (GDP) being transferred from the hands of the country's rich either to the state or to millions of small owners. The closest parallel to such a large-scale social programme had been in the early days of Mohamed Ali Pasha's rule in the early nineteenth century.\"\n\nIn 1956-1957, 25,000 Jews – almost half of the Jewish population of Egypt – were expelled from the country. Another 1,000 were imprisoned. (By 1972 the remainder had also been expelled.)\n\nEgypt's nationalisation of the British-owned Suez Canal was a great victory for Nasser who was celebrated as both an Egyptian hero and an Arab one, capable of `defeating the nation's enemies` and `representing Arab dignity`.\" Chinese premier Zhou Enlai called Nasser `the giant of the Middle East.`\n\nNasser emerged as one of the architects of the Non-Aligned Movement, which was founded in 1961 as a bloc of `independent nations` detached from both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Almost all African anti-colonialist freedom fighters came to him for guidance, moral support and funds.\n\nA major reason why conservative Arab regimes felt threatened by Nasser during his first years in power was because his popularity had been demonstrated – even before the Suez crisis – when he became a leading critic of the 1955 Baghdad Pact. The Baghdad Pact was initially an alliance between Iraq and Turkey, which Britain supported with the goal of strengthening its power within the Middle East. Nasser considered the Baghdad Pact to be part of a British effort to split the Arab countries into differing groups, and to divide the region by escalating tension between them. The British later attempted to bring Jordan into the Baghdad Pact in late 1955 after Nasser agreed to purchase arms from Czechoslovokia in the Soviet bloc. The British were determined to bring Jordan into the Baghdad Pact and to apply pressure to try and force Jordan to join. Nasser had opposed the Baghdad Pact, and his successful effort to prevent Jordan from joining the pact is an example of his pragmatic diplomatic strategy. Nasser’s pragmatism towards Jordan meant that he aimed to force the Jordan regime to decline to join the pact, but he did not himself attempt to overthrow the regime. This stance was rewarded with Jordanian support for Egypt during the Suez Crisis the following year in 1956.\n\nThe dispute over Jordanian membership in the Baghdad pact lasted from November to December 1955. Nasser’s goal was based on Egyptian national interests – he wanted to prevent Jordanian membership in the Baghdad Pact, which was more important to him than the fate of the Jordanian regime. He was thus prepared to offer the Jordanian regime a way out in which it could survive if it did not join the pact. Nasser’s strategy during the debate over the Baghdad Pact was to apply rhetorical pressure using Egyptian propaganda to launch broadcasts attacking the British, and also warning the Jordanian regime that it could be overthrown if it agreed to join the pact. The Egyptian propaganda led to riots occurring in Jordan in December 1955 during a visit of British Field Marshal Templer, who was serving as the British Defense Chief of Staff.\n\nThe nature of the message that Egyptian propaganda conveyed during the crisis over Jordanian accession to the Baghdad pact is very significant. Its primary focus was on attacking the British rather than the Jordanian regime itself, and it did not itself call for the overthrow of King Hussein. In other words, this propaganda was intended to pressure the regime, and likely to implicitly convince King Hussein that his prospects for remaining in power would be greater if he declined to join the Baghdad Pact, and Jordan decided in December that it would not join the agreement. King Hussein remained in power, and sided with Egypt in future crises such as in the 1956 Suez Crisis or in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Egypt thus derived a direct reward from their pragmatic approach towards King Hussein’s regime, and the example of the dispute over the Baghdad Pact may have convinced King Hussein that he needed to align with Egypt in future crisis situations. The power of Arab Nationalism also led King Hussein to dismiss the British General John Bagot Glubb as commander of the Arab Legion in 1956. The dismissal of Glubb took place while the British Foreign Secretary was in Egypt, and the British believed that represented a direct challenge by Nasser to their authority in the region.\n\nEgypt had been seeking loans from the World Bank since late 1955 to finance the construction of the Aswan High Dam. A tentative agreement with the World Bank, the US and Britain indicated that US$70 million would be provided for the project. However, Nasser had recently (September 27, 1955) negotiated an agreement with the Soviet Union which provided technical and military aid to the regime, thereby angering the United States which had up until the point been supportive of Nasser and his anti-British and anti-French colonialism. Consequently, after pressure from the British government concerning the threat posed by Nasser, on 20 July 1956, the US and Britain withdrew their offers of funding, and the World Bank went back on the agreement. On 26 July, Nasser gave a historic speech announcing the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company, under his \"Egyptionization\" policy, and whose revenues would be used to finance the construction of the High Dam, which was completed in January 1968. The nationalisation escalated tension with Britain and France, which froze Egyptian assets and put their armies on alert.\n\nOn 1 August, the USSR offered to fund the High Dam project. Relations with Britain and France which had deteriorated to a frosty cold war level by the summer, were framed anew when the United States withdrew much of its support in demonstration against Nasser's growing friendship with the Soviet Union. Having at last convinced the United States of its error in supporting the Free Officers Movement and the special threat posed by Nasser, the British and French felt free to intrigue for his overthrow. These moved culminated in the Tripartite Anglo-French-Israeli aggression on Egypt in October.\n\nIn a final replay of old European power politics, the British and French negotiated a plan with Israel which would result in the return of the Suez to the British and French, the overthrow of the Nasser regime, and restoration of European, Christian and Jewish property. Although the later had suffered under the new regime, unlike the Europeans, most Jewish property survived the Egyptianization. Consequently, Israel, which had previously been used as an interlocuteur for both Soviet and American support for the RCC still had substantial elements operating in Egypt. Now the British and French decided to use this to their advantage once Israel saw the large threat Nasser posed to their continued existence. Under their plan, Israeli elements in Egypt with launch false flag operations which would be used as a pretext for Israeli launching a surprise attack on Egypt across the Sinai and toward the Suez. Using the terms of the Canal treaty which allowed the British and French to use military force in protection of the canal, an Anglo-French force would invade the canal area and subsequently invade Cairo.\n\nIsraeli troops invaded Gaza and advanced toward the Sinai on 29 October. Accordingly, under the terms of the Canal Treaty, the British and French troops attacked the Canal Zone on 31 October using a combined force of air strikes, naval bombardment, and parachute drops. Large amphibious and infantry units were steaming from Cyprus and Algeria toward the canal for the final occupation and push into Cairo. Whilst the operation had all the elements necessary for surprise and legerdomain, it lacked quickness of speed given the relative strategic weakness which the British and French found themselves in the post-war period.\n\nFor although the British and French still had substantial force projection capabilities and were the overwhelming military power in the region, both countries were heavily dependent on American support for their economies through the purchase of British and French debt, American direct investment, and most importantly, through the support American oil companies provided for European consumption. Consequently, by the time when the Anglo-French armada began its reinforcement of British and French positions on the Canal, the American government had already come under massive pressure from the United Nations, the Soviet Union, and most importantly from American oil companies which saw the British and French as impediments to their commercial expansion in the Middle East.\n\nWhen the American anger at the British and French intervention was felt at Whitehall, the British government fractured between those who saw the futility of maintaining the British Empire, those who saw the potential threat the Americans posed to the overall British economy should they end financial support of the British economy, and those British interests which still saw a need, a necessity and a reason for maintaining the British Empire. Thus, when the Eisenhower Administration initiated an oil embargo on the British and French, there was immediate panic in the British government. The French however were proving more resolute and flouted American demands stating matter of factly that America had no interest in the Middle East and were duplicitous in their support of Arab nationalism and anti-colonialism.\n\nHowever, with the embargo, the British pound which as a reserve currency was used in the purchase of oil had its liquidity threatened. While the British government debated this turn of events, the military campaign dithered and proved lackluster in its execution, thereby buying crucial time for the Nasser regime to rally support from American liberals, the Soviet Union, and others in the United Nations. Finally, when in a bid of solidarity with the Nasser regime, the US government said it would no longer price support the British pound through the purchasing of British debt, the appeasers within the British government gained the upper hand and forced a surrender to American demands. Consequently, British operations were halted on 7 November. When negotiations between the British and Americans made clear that the US was in opposition to the continuation of the British and French Empires, the British government's position on its control of the Suez Canal collapsed. Henceforth it was not military operations but the liquidation of what remained of British and French assets and prestige which allowed the Anglo-French armies to remain until finally, on 22 December they were removed. As a result, all British and French banks and companies, 15,000 establishments in all, were nationalized, a process that was later extended to all foreign establishments and also to Egyptian firms. But more importantly, the event marked the abandonment of by the United States to an overt Western Civilizational identity especially of supremacy, as well as America's opposition to a European global commercial presence which it viewed as a competitor to its own global vision. As a result, with the primary leader of the West opposed to the very raison d'être of European colonialism, the Suez Crisis, initiated by the Free Officers Movement and the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 marked the end of European Civilization Supremacy.\n\nAccording to the prominent historian Abd aI-’Azim Ramadan, Nasser decision to nationalize the Suez Canal was his alone, made without political or military consultation. The events leading up to the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, as other events during Nasser’s rule, showed Nasser’s inclination to solitary decision making. He considers Nasser to be far from a rational, responsible leader.\n\nOn 22 February 1958, Egypt united with Syria, creating the United Arab Republic (UAR). The 1956 Constitution was abrogated following the union and a provisional one decreed. The Egyptian National Assembly was dissolved. On 2 April, Nasser issued a decree establishing the flag of the Republic as three horizontal bars of red, white and black with two stars. There was a crackdown on communists on 31 December for their allegedly lukewarm response to the Union with Syria.\n\nFollowing Syrian secession in 1962, a Preparatory Committee of the National Congress of Popular Forces was convened in Cairo to prepare for a National Congress to lay down a Charter for National Action. The 1,750-member Congress of representatives from peasant, laborer, professional and occupational associations meets in May to debate the Draft National Charter presented by Nasser. On 30 June, the Congress approves the Charter, which sets up a new political organization, the Arab Socialist Union (ASU) to replace the National Union. 50 per cent of the seats in the ASU are to be filled by farmers and workers. Elected ASU units are set up in factories, firms, agricultural cooperatives, ministries and professional syndicates.\n\nIn 1962, Egypt became involved in the civil war in Yemen, supporting the revolutionary regime of Abdullah al-Sallal that had ousted the country's former ruler, Imam Badr, and declared a republic. This proved to be a considerable financial and military burden on Egypt and created antipathy toward Saudi Arabia, which supported the Yemeni royalists.\n\nUnder Arab pressure and as a result of rising popular expectations of Arab military might, on 18 May 1967, Nasser asks UN Secretary General U Thant to withdraw the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) stationed on Egypt's side of the border with Israel in Sinai. Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping in retaliation for Israel's diversion of the River Jordan. King Hussein of Jordan visited Cairo on 30 May, signing a Jordanian-Egyptian defense pact.\n\nOn 5 June, Israeli army forces dealt a crushing blow to Egypt. Seventeen Egyptian airfields were attacked, and most of the Egyptian air force destroyed on the ground leading to the Israeli occupation of the Sinai Peninsula. Jordan entered the war on Egypt's side, but was forced to accept a UN Security Council ceasefire on 7 June after Israel occupied the Jordanian-controlled territories of the West Bank and the Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip. Egypt also accepted the ceasefire. Israeli troops attacked the strategic military installations in the Syrian Golan Heights, occupying the town of Quneitra. Syria accepted the ceasefire on 10 June.\n\nEgypt's defeat in the 1967 War compelled Nasser to resign on 9 June, naming Vice-President Zakaria Mohieddin as his successor. However, he relented following massive popular demonstrations of support. Seven high-ranking officers were tried in the wake of the defeat, including Minister of War Shams Badran. Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces Field-Marshal Abdel-Hakim Amer was arrested and is reported to have committed suicide while in custody in August.\n\nAt the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s, less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich, four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor. Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school, and most of them being boys. Nearly 75% of the population over ten years of age, and over 90% of all females were illiterate. Nasser's policies changed this. Land reform, the major assets' confiscation programme, the dramatic growth in university education, the creation of a dominating public sector flattened the social curve. From academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66, overall public school enrollments more than doubled. Millions of previously poor Egyptians, through education and jobs in the public sector, joined the middle class. Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, journalists, constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10267717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10267717", "title": "Homesh", "text": "Homesh\n\nHomesh () was a community settlement and Israeli settlement in the northern Samarian hills of the West Bank along Route 60. The village fell under the administrative jurisdiction of the Shomron Regional Council. In 2005, the town's homes were demolished, as part of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza and four settlements in the northern West Bank.\n\nThe international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.\n\nThe village was established in 1978 on 173 acres (700 dunams) of confiscated land belonging to the nearby Palestinian village of Burqa, whose ownership was certified in the land registry. It began as a pioneer Nahal military outpost, and demilitarized when turned over to residential purposes in 1980 to secular Jews. During the Second Intifada about half of the residents left. Shortly thereafter, dozens of Orthodox Jews moved to the village in order to show support for the continued settlement of the area.\nThe Homesh Yeshiva has endeavoured to retain some hold on the area by sleeping in nearby caves. The IDF maintained a requisition order to impede Palestinians from returning to the land for eight years, and only rescinded it when the case came up before the Supreme Court in 2013. Palestinian owners are now replanting the area, and a rise in attempts by Jewish extremists to wrest back control is expected.\n\nThe residents of Homesh were forcefully evicted from their homes and their houses demolished as part of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza and four settlements in the northern West Bank of August 2005. Since that time, former residents and others have revisited the ruins multiple times and are making efforts to return to the site and rebuild. Kibbutz Yad Hana accepted the government's offer to absorb settlers evicted from Homesh in the partial disengagement from the occupied territories (see Protocol N.31 of the Knesset Ombudsman sub-committee on the disengaged, 5 January 2009) and was renamed Yad Hana-Homesh.\n\nIn 2006 during Hanukkah, a few hundred people, including settlers and some former residents, arrived at Homesh and lit a Hanukkah 'shamash' candle. A declaration was made that this effort was the first step in rebuilding Homesh. On March 26, 2007, a few thousand supporters and former residents marched to Homesh and declared their wish to stay and rebuild. While the 'Disengagement Law' forbids Jewish citizens from being in the area, the Israeli army and police said that they allowed the march in order to avoid marchers detouring around roadblocks through Arab areas and to avoid violence such as in the evacuation of Amona. The new resettlement was demolished on March 28, 2007, by the Israel Police, border police and military police. After being evacuated the marchers said that they would try again. Another march of thousands took place on April 24, 2007, the Israeli Independence Day. Many are determined to return to their former homes. During an ascent in June 2007, the largest remaining structure in Homesh, its water tower, was painted orange, the color of the anti-disengagement movement. The color made the hilltop more visible in its surroundings, emboldening those hoping to rebuild the community.\n\nIn late July 2007, another wider effort began in the effort to renew a permanent presence on the site. Hundreds of Israelis detoured around roadblocks to reach the site. Since then, while the police make attempts to clear the site, new visitors have returned with those who had been removed.\n\nIn 2007, during Rosh Hashana, dozens of Jews were evicted and not allowed to celebrate the holiday at Homesh. Judea and Samaria police told the media that the terror alert necessitated the eviction of the families despite the fact that it involved desecration of the holiday. \"The sensitivity to the holiday is important but after assessment sessions were held, it was decided that there was a need to operate during the holiday.\" \n\nIn June 2007, Knesset member Aryeh Eldad announced that he has the support of 42 Knesset members, in a bill proposing the rebuilding of Homesh, and the decriminalization of further rebuilding attempts. The bill is likely to be voted on in the fall session of 2008.\n\nFatah military commander Abu Araj has stated that if settlers return to Homesh, the Palestinians would meet the Jewish community with, \"fire and attacks. We will not let this entrance go by quietly, and just as before, we will make every effort to liberate our land all over again.\"\n\nIn August 2007, an Israeli court ruled that it was not illegal entering the ruins of Homesh. Nevertheless, the army frequently declares the site a closed military zone and that it is illegal for civilians to be there.\n\nJustice David Gadol ruled that the Disengagement Law, on which the state bases its prohibition on entering the ruins of Homesh was legislated is not to be utilized for different purposes after that event. The judge also ruled that the government has not relinquished Homesh to another sovereignty and that its status and access roads remain \"Area 'C'\" which is in full control of Israel and with no restrictions on Israeli traffic, \"After the evacuation of Homesh, Ganim and Kadim, unlike the evacuation of the Gaza Strip settlements, as far as I know, the areas were not transferred to what is known as the Palestinian Authority. As I recall, there were pictures of Palestinians from the area looting the property that was left behind by the evacuating forces. For this reason it is important to legally define whether this territory has Area 'C' status,\" Justice David Gadol stated, according to Haaretz.\n\nA documentary film The Skies are Closer in Homesh, was made about the settlement, which, after it was razed by the Israeli government, became a \"hot touring destination\" among people who wished to express political support for the settlement movement.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3808543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3808543", "title": "Japanese mon (currency)", "text": "Japanese mon (currency)\n\nThe was the currency of Japan from the Muromachi period in 1336, until the early Meiji period in 1870. It co-circulated with the new sen until 1891. The Kanji for \"mon\" is and the character for currency was widely used in the Chinese-character cultural sphere, e.g. Chinese wen, Korean mun. Throughout Japanese history, there were many different styles of currency of many shapes, styles, designs, sizes and materials, including gold, silver, bronze, etc. Coins denominated in mon were cast in copper or iron and circulated alongside silver and gold ingots denominated in \"shu\", \"bu\" and \"ryō\", with 4000 mon = 16 shu = 4 bu = 1 ryo. In 1869, due to depreciation against gold, the new fixing officially was set for 1 ryo/yen = equal to 10.000 mon. The yen started to replace the old duodecimal denominations in 1870: in 3rd quarter of 1870, the first new coins appeared, namely 5, 10, 50 sen silver and 2, 5, 10, 20 Yen. Smaller sen coins did not appear before spring, 1873. So the mon coins (1, 4, 100, 250 mon etc.) remained a necessity for ordinary peoples commodities and were allowed to circulate until 1891.12.31. Only from Jan. 1, 1954 onward the mon became invalid: postwar inflation had removed sen, mon etc. denominations smaller than 1 Yen. Due to the missing small coinage, the Japanese posts e.g. issued their first stamps (Meiji 4.3.1/1871.4.20) in mon and fixed postal rates in mon until April, 1872 (Meiji 5.2.28).\n\nDuring the co-existence of the mon with the sen between 1870 and 1891, the metal content of the old currency became important. Official exchange for coins from 1871.6.27: 4 copper mon = 2 rin, 1 bronze mon = 1 rin (1 rin = 1/10th of a sen). So while not all mon were valued equally, their metal kind counted after the transition to decimal sen: bronze was valued more highly than copper. The first physical rin denomination was introduced 1873 with the 1 rin coin (with the 5 rin coin introduced in 1916), as until that time the rin had existed only as an accounting unit (10 rin = 1 sen). The most current coin, the \"Tempō Tsūhō\" (, a coin with a face value of 100 mon) was valued at only 8 rin (0.8 sen) in that sen period.\n\nThough the production of copper, silver, and gold coins had already started in the eight century, they weren’t often used as a medium for exchange until later when the Japanese started importing Chinese coins which replaced the Japanese barter economy. As internal trade grew due to agricultural and handicraft developments, the people started preferring coinage over barter leading to a growth of demand in copper coins. The Southern Song dynasty prohibited the export of its coinage in 1179 due to its problem with the outflow of currency, but shiploads of Chinese coins would still enter Japan annually through Ningbo. Since the trade had begun with Japan and they received payment in Chinese coins for Japanese goods they stopped minting their own copper coinage until 1587. The Ashikaga shogunate imported \"Kōbu Tsūhō\" (洪武通寶), \"Eiraku Tsūhō\" (永樂通寳), and \"Katei Tsūhō\" (嘉靖通寶) from the Ming dynasty which they referred to as \"Toraisen\" or \"Minsen\" () but the high demand for copper coinage inspired local and private production of copper coins (\"Shichūsen\", ). An example of a \"Shichūsen\" used for trade with China and the Ryukyu Kingdom would be a \"Kōbu Tsūhō\" coin minted by Satsuma domain which included the character “” (\"Ji\") on the reverse indicating that it was minted at the town of Kajiki, while still using the inscription of the Hongwu Emperor of Ming China. Some \"Shichūsen\" would also bear the inscriptions of coins from the Song dynasty, although it was not uncommon for many coins to simply be recasts and copies of older Song and Ming dynasty coins in the form of \"Iutsushi\" (鋳写し) or by simply adding extra carvings on existing circulating Chinese coins.\n\n\"Bitasen\" () refers to the Shichūsen coinage produced in Japan by the nobility and private local mints, and not by the imperial government or before the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate which were often poor in appearance, as well as damaged and worn out imported Chinese coins.\n\nOver time these coins would become damaged and this made sellers more discriminative in what coins they would accept at face value often accepting them only at ¼ of a good quality coin, though Chinese coins would continue to circulate in Eastern Japan, the confusion and chaos caused by the \"Bitasen\" coinage caused rice to replace copper coinage in Western Japan. From 1608 onwards it was illegal to pay with \"Bitasen\" and the shogunate opened more mines for the production of copper, silver, and gold coinages. Despite this however \"Bitasen\" continued to circulate within Japan, but from 1670 the \"Eiraku Tsūhō\" was completely prohibited from circulation and depreciated in favour of the \"Kan'ei Tsūhō\".\n\nIn 1636, the \"Kan'ei Tsūhō\" (Kyūjitai: 寛永通寳 ; Shinjitai: 寛永通宝) coin was introduced by the government of the Tokugawa shogunate as a means to standardise copper coins and keep up a sufficient supply of copper coinage, being the first government minted copper coin in 700 years, despite this however they were introduced in the Mito domain 10 years prior during the 3rd year of the Kan'ei era. These coins would become the daily currency of the common people and would be used for small payments. Due to the isolationist policies of the Tokugawa shogunate the outflow of currency halted and \"Kan'ei Tsūhō\" coins would continue to stay the main coin circulating in Japan, \"Kan'ei Tsūhō\" were minted for 230 years despite the fact that the Kan’ei era ended in 1643, \"Kan'ei Tsūhō\" coins would continue to bear the \"Kan’ei\" legend, even when a new denomination of the coin was introduced a century later, though they weren’t all uniform as the shogunate outsourced the mintage to regional and local merchants who would cast them at varying weights and sizes, as well as occasionally having local mint marks, by the 1650s 16 private mints were opened for the production of Kan'ei Tsūhō coins all over Japan. Kan'ei Tsūhō produced before 1688 are referred to as “old Kan’ei” and are recognisable by their similar calligraphic styles making them hard to differentiate from one another, meanwhile \"Kan'ei Tsūhō\" coins produced after 1688 (or “new Kan’ei” coins) tend to be more diverse in calligraphic styling, and the 4 mon denomination has waves on its reverse making it easily distinguishable from other coins.\n\nFrom 1738 government authorised the manufacture of iron \"Kan'ei Tsūhō\" 1 mon coins, and in 1866 (just before the end of the Edo period) iron 4 mon \"Kan'ei Tsūhō\" were authorised. While iron coins were being minted the quality of copper coins would decrease due to frequent debasements.\n\nAs \"Bitasen\" coins were no longer allowed to circulate within Japan, Japanese traders started selling them on foreign markets for profits, especially on the Vietnamese market where a huge influx of \"Eiraku Tsūhō\" and \"Kan'ei Tsūhō\" coins from Japan made the Japanese mon the \"de facto\" currency of the region. The large export of Japanese coins to Vietnam during this period mostly happened on Red seal ships.\n\nFrom 1633 the Tokugawa government adopted the isolationist Sakoku policy. The Shogunate however opened up the seaport of Nagasaki to export with the Dutch East India Company and Chinese merchant ships from Southeast Asia, the Japanese merchants who were now prohibited from exporting mon coins directly to Vietnam used the Dutch traders as middlemen and exported between 1633 and 1637 around 105,835 strings of 960 \"Eiraku Tsūhō\" and \"Kan’ei Tsūhō coins\" (or 101,600,640 mon) to Vietnam, and from 1659 this continued with the Nagasaki trade coins which were specifically minted for foreign markets, this is why they were escribed with Song dynasty inscriptions as coins from the Song dynasty were already circulating in Southeast Asia and the populace had already become accustomed to them. The trade of mon coins stopped however after the Shogunate banned the export of copper in 1715.\n\nIn 1708 the Tokugawa shogunate introduced the \"Hōei Tsūhō\" (Kyūjitai: 寳永通寳 ; Shinjitai: 宝永通宝) which had a face value of 10 mon (but contained 3 times as much copper as a 1 mon \"Kan’ei Tsūhō\" coin), which lead to the coin being discontinued very shortly after it started circulating as it wasn't accepted for its nominal value.\n\nHowever, in 1835 (during the Bakumatsu) the Tokugawa shogunate tried issuing a larger denomination copper coin again with the \"Tenpō Tsūhō\" 100 mon coin which this time only contained five and a half times the amount of copper in a 1 mon coin, but was accepted nonetheless. The introduction of this denomination caused large scale inflation comparable to that of caused by the 100 wén coin minted by the Qing dynasty in 1853, or the 100 mun coin issued by the Kingdom of Joseon in 1866. The reason for the change in mentality was the scarcity of copper which had earlier forced the Japanese to mint iron coins breaking the previously established tri-metallic system. The concurrent circulation of 1, 4, and (heavily debased) 100 mon coins caused for a chaotic reaction from the market as did widespread circulation of forged coinage.\n\nAnother major cause for inflation was that from 1859 local Daimyō started minting their own coinage often with high denominations to increase the money supply or to get more gold and silver for their low copper supplies, in 1862 this inspired Daimyō Shimazu Nariakira to produce \"Tenpō Tsūhō\" derivatives in the form of 100 on \"Ryūkyū Tsūhō\" coins and even ½ Shu \"Ryūkyū Tsūhō\" coins under the pretence of minting coins for their vassal Ryukyu Kingdom, this proved profitable for the Satsuma domain.\n\nMon coins were holed, allowing them to be strung together on a piece of string. \nIn the Edo-period of Japan (1615-1868), stringed-together coins received a small discount when presented like this. E.g. for 100 Mon payment: if those 1 Mon coins were all tied in a row, discount given was 4 mon, so 96 stringed coins of 1 mon were accepted at par with 100 mon. Similar discounts existed probably for other bulk payments with small coinage in stringed form.\n\nDuring the history of the Japanese mon, many different coins with different inscriptions were cast, the main coins cast by the central government were:\n\nMany Japanese domains produced their own currency which happened chaotically, so that the nation’s money supply expanded by 2.5 times between 1859 and 1869, leading to crumbling money values and soaring prices.\n\nThese coins were often produced with the name of the domain or province on them, the mon coins produced by domains are:\n\n\n\n"}

After graduating from a local trade school in Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine), he attended a notable Jesuit gymnasium in Chyrów. After graduating in 1914 he went for vacations to Russian-held part of Poland, where he was caught by the outbreak of World War I. Arrested by the Russians as a citizen of Austria-Hungary, Kirchmayer was interned and sent to mainland Russia. There he was allowed to join the Polish 3rd Corps in the East, with which he returned to Poland in December 1918. Together with the remnants of his unit he joined the Polish Army and served with distinction in the 7th Regiment of Artillery during the Polish-Bolshevik War.\n\nAfter the war he remained in the army and graduated from an artillery NCO school in 1921. The following year his military grade was revised to Second Lieutenant and in 1924 he graduated from Toruń military academy, receiving the grade of first lieutenant. Simultaneously, between 1921 and 1930 he served at various posts in 3rd and 16th Field Artillery Regiments. Between 1924 and 1926 he also served in the Artillery Bureau of the French Military Mission to Poland. In 1930 he was promoted to captain and after two years he was attached to the headquarters of the Polish 13th Infantry Division as the deputy commander of artillery. In 1936 he was promoted to major and before the outbreak of World War II he was assigned to the Toruń Army Inspectorate.\n\nDuring the Polish Defensive War of 1939, Kirchmayer served as the deputy Chief of Operations of the Pomorze Army. After the battle of Bzura he broke through with his forces to Warsaw, receiving heavy wounds during the battles in Kampinos Forest. He avoided being captured by the Germans and joined the ZWZ resistance organization, later reformed into Home Army. In 1942 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. During his service as the Chief of Staff of the Warsaw-Voivodship Home Army Area he lost his leg in one of the actions. Transferred to Eastern Poland for recovery, he was caught up by the Soviet offensive and in July 1944 he joined the 1st Polish Army under Gen. Zygmunt Berling. He was accepted as the chief of Military Historical Office, and later he headed the chief of Historical Division of the General Staff of the Polish Army. His grade was verified to colonel in 1945 and in 1947 he also served as a special officer of the Chief of Staff.\n\nLater the same year he was promoted to brigadier general and assigned to the Academy of General Staff in Warsaw, where he served as a tutor and a deacon. However, the following year his service in the Home Army was discovered by his superiors and Kirchmayer was dismissed from the army. In 1950 he was arrested by the Urząd Bezpieczeństwa and the following year he was sentenced to life imprisonment under false accusations of espionage and conspiracy during the so-called Trial of the Generals. He spent four years in various communist prison camps in Poland. During the short political thaw in October 1955 he was released from prison and rehabilitated in April 1956, but his health never fully recovered. He was not allowed to join the army and joined the Historical Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences. He died on 11 April 1959 in Otwock and was buried in Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw.\n\n\n"}

Her parents were both Communist Party of China officials, and her father was greatly interested in literature. As a child she quickly developed a love of reading and writing, which included composing poetry.\n\nAs Party cadres, life was relatively good for her family at first; her parents worked hard, and her father became successful as a propagandist at a regional level. His formal ranking was as a \"level 10 official\", meaning that he was one of 20,000 or so most important cadres, or \"ganbu\", in the country. The Communist Party provided her family with a dwelling in a guarded, walled compound, a maid and chauffeur, as well as a wet-nurse and nanny for Chang and her four siblings. This level of privilege in China's relatively impoverished 1950s was extraordinary.\n\nChang writes that she was originally named Er-hong (二鴻 \"Second Swan\"), which sounds like the Chinese word for \"faded red\". As communists were \"deep red\", she asked her father to rename her when she was 12 years old, specifying she wanted \"a name with a military ring to it.\" He suggested \"Jung\", which means \"martial affairs.\"\n\nLike many of her peers, Chang chose to become a Red Guard at the age of 14, during the early years of the Cultural Revolution. In \"Wild Swans\" she said she was \"keen to do so\", \"thrilled by my red armband\". In her memoirs, Chang states that she refused to participate in the attacks on her teachers and other Chinese, and she left after a short period as she found the Red Guards too violent.\n\nThe failures of the Great Leap Forward had led her parents to oppose Mao Zedong's policies. They were targeted during the Cultural Revolution, as most high-ranking officials were. When Chang's father criticised Mao by name, Chang writes in \"Wild Swans\" that this exposed them to retaliation from Mao's supporters. Her parents were publicly humiliated – ink was poured over their heads, they were forced to wear placards denouncing them around their necks, kneel in gravel and to stand outside in the rain – followed by imprisonment, her father's treatment leading to lasting physical and mental illness. Their careers were destroyed, and her family was forced to leave their home.\n\nBefore her parents' denunciation and imprisonment, Chang had unquestioningly supported Mao and criticised herself for any momentary doubts. But by the time of his death, her respect for Mao, she writes, had been destroyed. Chang wrote that when she heard he had died, she had to bury her head in the shoulder of another student to pretend she was grieving. She explained her change on the stance of Mao with the following comments:\n\nAccording to Wild Swans (chapter 23-chapter 28), Chang's life during the Cultural Revolution and the years immediately after the Cultural Revolution was one of both a victim and one of the privileged. Chang attended Sichuan University in 1973 and became one of the so-called \"Students of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers\". Her father's government-sponsored official funeral was held in 1975. Chang was able to leave China and study in the UK on a Chinese government scholarship in 1978, a year before the post-Mao Reforms began.\n\nThe closing down of the university system led Chang, like most of her generation, away from the political maelstroms of the academy. Instead, she spent several years as a peasant, a barefoot doctor (a part-time peasant doctor), a steelworker and an electrician, though she received no formal training because of Mao's policy, which did not require formal instruction as a prerequisite for such work.\n\nThe universities were eventually re-opened and she gained a place at Sichuan University to study English, later becoming an assistant lecturer there. After Mao's death, she passed an exam which allowed her to study in the West, and her application to leave China was approved once her father was politically rehabilitated. \n\nChang left China in 1978 to study in Britain on a government scholarship, staying first in London. She later moved to Yorkshire, studying linguistics at the University of York with a scholarship from the university itself, living in Derwent College. She received her PhD in linguistics from York in 1982, becoming the first person from the People's Republic of China to be awarded a PhD from a British university. In 1986, she and Jon Halliday published \"Mme Sun Yat-sen (Soong Ching-ling)\", a biography of Sun Yat-Sen's widow.\n\nShe has also been awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Buckingham, the University of York, the University of Warwick, Dundee University, Bowdoin College (USA), and the Open University. She lectured for some time at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, before leaving in the 1990s to concentrate on her writing.\n\nIn 2003, Jung Chang wrote a new foreword to \"Wild Swans\", describing her early life in Britain and explaining why she wrote the book. Having lived in China during the 1960s and 1970s, she found Britain exciting and loved the country, especially its diverse range of culture, literature and arts. She found even colourful window-boxes worth writing home about – Hyde Park and the Kew Gardens were inspiring. She took every opportunity to watch Shakespeare's plays in both London and York. However she still has a special place for China in her heart, saying in an interview with HarperCollins, \"I feel perhaps my heart is still in China\".\n\nChang lives in west London with her husband, the Irish historian Jon Halliday, who specialises in history of Asia. She was able to visit mainland China to see her family, with permission from the Chinese authorities, despite the fact that all her books are banned.\n\nThe publication of Jung Chang's second book \"Wild Swans\" made her a celebrity. Chang's unique style, using a personal description of the life of three generations of Chinese women to highlight the many changes that the country went through, proved to be highly successful. Large numbers of sales were generated, and the book's popularity led to its being sold around the world and translated into nearly 40 languages.\n\nChang became a popular figure for talks about Communist China; and she has travelled across Britain, Europe, America, and many other places in the world. She returned to the University of York on 14 June 2005, to address the university's debating union and spoke to an audience of over 300, most of whom were students. The BBC invited her onto the panel of \"Question Time\" for a first-ever broadcast from Shanghai on 10 March 2005, but she was unable to attend when she broke her leg a few days beforehand.\n\nThe international best-seller is a biography of three generations of Chinese women in 20th century China – her grandmother, mother, and herself. Chang paints a vivid portrait of the political and military turmoil of China in this period, from the marriage of her grandmother to a warlord, to her mother's experience of Japanese-occupied Jinzhou during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and her own experience of the effects of Mao's policies of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\"Wild Swans\" was translated into 38 languages and sold 20 million copies, receiving praise from authors such as J. G. Ballard. It is banned in mainland China, though many pirated versions circulated, as are translations in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nChang's 2005 work, a biography of Mao, was co-authored with her husband Jon Halliday and portrays Mao in an extremely negative light. The couple traveled all over the world to research the book, which took 12 years to write. They interviewed hundreds of people who had known Mao, including George Bush, Sr., Henry Kissinger, and Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama. Henry Kissinger called it \"grotesque in that it depicts Mao as a man without any qualities.\" Later he described it in his book \"On China\" as \"one-sided but often thought-provoking.\" \n\nAmong their criticisms of Mao, Chang and Halliday argue that, despite his having been born into a relatively rich peasant family, he had little well-informed concern for the long-term welfare of the Chinese peasantry. They hold Mao responsible for the famine resulting from the Great Leap Forward and state that he had created the famine by exporting food when China had insufficient grain to feed its own people. They also write that Mao had arranged for the arrests and murders of many of his political opponents, including some of his personal friends, and they argue that he was a far more tyrannical leader than had previously been thought.\n\n\"Mao: The Unknown Story\" became a best-seller, with UK sales alone reaching 60,000 in six months. Academics and commentators wrote reviews ranging from praise to criticism. Professor Richard Baum said that it had to be \"taken very seriously as the most thoroughly researched and richly documented piece of synthetic scholarship\" on Mao. On the other hand, \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" reported that while few commentators \"disput[ed] the subject,\" \"some of the world's most eminent scholars of modern Chinese history\" had referred to the book as \"a gross distortion of the records.\"\n\nIn October 2013, Chang published a biography of Empress Dowager Cixi, who led China from 1861 until her death in 1908. Chang argues that Cixi has been \"deemed either tyrannical and vicious, or hopelessly incompetent—or both,\" and that this view is both simplistic and inaccurate. Chang portrays her as intelligent, open-minded, and a proto-feminist limited by a xenophobic and deeply conservative imperial bureaucracy. Although Cixi is often accused of reactionary conservatism (especially for her treatment of the Guangxu Emperor during and after the Hundred Days' Reform), Chang demonstrates that Cixi actually started the Reforms and \"brought medieval China into the modern age.\" Newspaper reviews have also been positive in their assessment. Te-Ping Chen, writing in the \"Wall Street Journal\", found the book \"packed with details that bring to life its central character.\" Simon Sebag Montefiore writes: \"Filled with new revelations, it’s a gripping and surprising story of an extraordinary woman in power. Using Chinese sources, totally untapped by western books, this reappraises one of the great monstresses of modern history… Jung Chang’s revisionism means that this book reveals a new and different woman: ambitious, sometimes murderous, but pragmatic and unique. All of this adds up to make Empress Dowager Cixi a powerful read.\" \n\nThe book also received critical treatment in the academic world. The Qing dynasty specialist Pamela Kyle Crossley wrote a skeptical review in the \"London Review of Books\". \"Chang has made impressive use of the rapidly expanding range of published material from the imperial archives. But understanding these sources requires profound study of the context. [...] Her claims regarding Cixi’s importance seem to be minted from her own musings, and have little to do with what we know was actually going in China. I am as eager as anyone to see more attention paid to women of historical significance. But rewriting Cixi as Catherine the Great or Margaret Thatcher is a poor bargain: the gain of an illusory icon at the expense of historical sense.\" . In the New York Times, Orville Schell called the biography \"a truly authoritative account of Cixi’s rule,\" and the paper named it one of its 'Notable Books of the Year'\n\n"}

Jörg Lanz, who called himself Lanz von Liebenfels (19 July 1874 – 22 April 1954), was an Austrian political and racial theorist and occultist, who was a pioneer of Ariosophy. He was a former monk and the founder of the magazine \"Ostara\", in which he published anti-semitic and \"völkisch\" theories.\n\nHe was born on 19 July 1874 in the Penzing district of Vienna in what was then Austria-Hungary, as the son of schoolmaster Johann Lanz and his wife Katharina, née Hoffenreich. His parents were middle class, and his father's ancestors had been burghers in Vienna since the early 18th century.\n\nLanz became a monk in the Cistercian order in 1893, assuming the name Georg and living in the Heiligenkreuz monastery. In 1894, he claimed to have been \"enlightened\" after finding the tombstone of a Knight Templar, and began developing his theories of \"blue-blond Aryanism\" and \"lower races\". He left the monastery in 1899; although Lanz claimed that this was due to \"growing nervousness\", the official documents recorded \"carnal love\" as the reason.\n\nIn 1905, he published his book \"Theozoölogie oder die Kunde von den Sodoms-Äfflingen und dem Götter-Elektron\" (\"Theozoology, or the Science of the Sodomite-Apelings and the Divine Electron\") in which he advocated sterilization of the sick and the \"lower races\" as well as forced labour for \"castrated chandals\", and glorified the \"Aryan race\" as \"Gottmenschen\" (\"god-men\"). Lanz justified his esoteric racial ideology by attempting to give it a Biblical foundation; according to him, Eve, whom he described as initially being divine, involved herself with a demon and gave birth to the \"lower races\" in the process. Furthermore, he claimed that this led to blonde women being attracted primarily to \"dark men\", something that only could be stopped by \"racial demixing\" so that the \"Aryan-Christian master humans\" could \"once again rule the dark-skinned beastmen\" and ultimately achieve divinity. A copy of this book was sent to Swedish poet August Strindberg, from whom Lanz received an enthusiastic reply in which he was described as a \"prophetic voice\".\n\nOne year later, in 1905, he founded the magazine \"Ostara, Briefbücherei der Blonden und Mannesrechtler\", of which he became the sole author and editor in 1908. Lanz himself claimed to have up to 100,000 subscribers, but it is generally agreed that this figure is grossly exaggerated. Readers of this publication included Adolf Hitler, Dietrich Eckart and the British Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener among others. Lanz claimed he was visited by the young Hitler in 1909, whom he supplied with two missing issues of the magazine.\n\nAs a student of Guido von List, Lanz further expanded his theories; other influences included Otto Weininger, of whom Lanz was a fervent follower.\n\nIn 1905 Lanz and some 50 other supporters of List signed a declaration endorsing the proposed \"Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft\" (Guido von List Society), which was officially founded in 1908. He also founded his own esoteric organisation, the \"Ordo Novi Templi\" (Order of the New Templars) in 1907. These movements were supposed to \"further the racial self-confidence by doing pedigree and racial research, beauty contests and the founding of racist \"future sites\" in underdeveloped parts of the Earth\" (\"das Rasse Bewusstsein durch Stammbaum- und Rassekunde Forschung, Schönheitswettbewerbe und die Gründung rassistischer Zukunftsstätten in unterentwickelten Teilen der Erde zu fördern\"). To further this agenda, he purchased the Werfenstein castle ruins in Austria. Neither organization managed to attract a large member base; though, it is estimated that the order had around 300 members, most prominent of which was the poet Fritz von Herzmanovsky-Orlando. Lanz's claim that the organization was already founded prior to 1900, and that he met with August Strindberg in 1896 and managed to convince him to join the order, have been shown to be fabricated.\n\nAfter Hitler's rise to prominence in the 1920s, Lanz tried to be recognized as one of his ideological precursors. In the preface of issue one in the 3rd series of \"Ostara\", c. 1927, he wrote: \n\nAfter Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, Lanz hoped for Hitler's patronage, but Hitler banned him from publishing his writings and copies of \"Ostara\" were removed from circulation. After the war, Lanz accused Hitler of having not only stolen but corrupted his idea, and also of being of \"inferior racial stock\".\n\nThere is no strong scholarly consensus as to whether Hitler was significantly influenced, directly or indirectly, by Lanz's work, and no strong evidence that he was interested in the occult movement as a whole apart from its racial aspects, though the association has been repeatedly made by critics and occultists during and after the Third Reich.\n\nIn his publications, Lanz mixed \"völkisch\" and anti-semitic ideas with Aryanism, racism and esotericism. The following is a partial list of Lanz's publications:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2813778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2813778", "title": "Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart", "text": "Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart\n\nLancelot, the Knight of the Cart () is a 12th-century Old French poem by Chrétien de Troyes, although it is believed that Chrétien did not complete the text himself. It is one of the first stories of the Arthurian legend to feature Lancelot as a prominent character. The narrative tells about the abduction of Queen Guinevere, and is the first text to feature the love affair between Lancelot and Guinevere.\n\nChrétien's writings impacted the Arthurian canon, establishing Lancelot’s subsequent prominence in English literature. He was the first writer to deal with the Arthurian themes of the lineage of Lancelot, his relationship to Guinevere, and the idea of courtly love.\n\nThe story centers on Lancelot's rescue of Guinevere after she has been abducted by Meleagant, the son of Bademagu. It deals with Lancelot's trials rescuing Guinevere, and his struggles to balance his duties both as a warrior and a lover bound by conventions.\n\nThe book begins with Guinevere being abducted by Meleagant, who tricked Arthur into allowing him to do so. After Gawain protests Arthur’s decision to let them go, Arthur allows Gawain to go after them. While Gawain is looking for the pair, he runs into the (then unnamed) Lancelot who, after riding his horse to death, convinces Gawain to lend him a horse in pursuit of the queen. Lancelot then speeds after Guinevere. When Gawain catches up to him, Lancelot has worn out his new horse to death just as he did his previous one. Lancelot encounters a cart-driving dwarf, who says he will tell Lancelot where Guinevere and her captor went if Lancelot agrees to ride in his cart. Lancelot boards the cart reluctantly since this is a dishonorable form of transport for a knight. Gawain, not about to demean himself, chooses to follow them on horseback. Along this journey they encounter many obstacles, the most prominent one arising because of other people being unwilling to talk to Lancelot since he is thought to be of a lowly status because he is riding in the cart. His first trial comes when a maiden offers a bed for the knights, but refuses to let Lancelot lie on it. It is then revealed to be a trap to kill the knights, but it does not faze Lancelot.\n\nAfter many more encounters with beautiful women and rude knights, Lancelot and Gawain decide to part so that they may cover more ground. Lancelot finds Guinevere in the castle of Gorre, but is then driven away by her coldness, which is later revealed to be because of his initial hesitation to enter the cart. Lancelot leaves to find Gawain but is then drawn back and Guinevere apologizes to him. Lancelot breaks into her tower and they spend a passionate night together. He injures his hand during his break-in, and leaves blood all over Guinevere's sheets. Lancelot sneaks out of the tower before sunrise, and Meleagant accuses Guinevere of committing adultery with Kay, who is the only wounded knight nearby. Lancelot challenges Meleagant to a fight to defend Guinevere’s honor. After Meleagant’s father interferes, Meleagant and Lancelot then agree to fight in a year's time. Over this year's time, Lancelot is tricked by another dwarf and forced into imprisonment while Guinevere is allowed to return home. When it comes time to duel, Lancelot bargains with his captors to let him go and fight, and he promises to return. When he finally does fight the tournament fighters, Guinevere asks him to lose in order to prove his love. He obliges and when he starts to lose, Guinevere changes her proposal, now instructing him to win. Lancelot complies and beats the other tournament competitors and afterwards he returns to his captors. Meleagant finds out from the captor's husband that the captor's wife was the one who agreed to release Lancelot temporarily (to fight at the tournament). Meleagant orders Lancelot to be locked away in a master craftsman's castle. The section ends with Lancelot imprisoned.\n\nIn a continuation, the woman whom Lancelot had earlier saved from kidnapping (she ordered Lancelot to sever her stalker's head) was actually Meleagant's sister. Meleagant's sister searches for Lancelot in order to return his favor. She finds an axe, and the rope used by Lancelot to pull up food, and sends up the axe instead. Lancelot chops his way out and escapes with her to a secluded home that she owns. Meanwhile, Gawain prepares to battle Meleagant, since Lancelot is missing (a one-year rematch after the second duel was established). Lancelot arrives on time and fights Meleagant, who loses his temper and his arm, and then is beheaded by Lancelot. Guinevere embraces Lancelot restrictively (they are in public) in the end.\n\nIt is unknown exactly when the poem was composed, only that it would have been between 1175 and 1181 (most likely 1177), and before or at the same time as Chrétien de Troyes' own \"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\", (\"Le Chevalier de Lion\"), the two serving as companion pieces with overlapping narratives. While little is known definitively about the life of Chrétien, many speculative theories exist based on his work. He was employed as a writer by aristocrats of Champagne, explaining the \"champenois\" dialect detected in his work, and he usually crafted stories based on material that was presented to him.\n\n\"The Knight of the Cart\" is believed to have been a story assigned to him by Marie de Champagne, and completed not by Chrétien himself, but by the clerk known as Godefroi de Leigni. A 12th-century French writer usually functioned as a part of a team, or a workshop attached to the court. It is believed that in the production of \"The Knight of the Cart\", Chrétien was provided with source material (or \"matiere\"), as well as a \"san\", or a derivation of the material. The \"matiere\" in this case would refer to the story of Lancelot, and the \"san\" would be his affair with Guinevere. Marie de Champagne was well known for her interest in affairs of courtly love, and is believed to have suggested the inclusion of this theme into the story. For this reason, it is said that Chrétien could not finish the story himself because he did not support the adulterous themes.\n\nChrétien cites Marie de Champagne in his introduction for providing his source material, although no such texts exist today. No recorded mention of an Arthurian knight named Lancelot precedes Chrétien, but he is believed to be derived from a Celtic myth. Chrétien first mentions a character named \"Lanceloz del Lac\" in \"Erec and Enide\", who he lists third among Arthur's knights after Gawain and Erec. He next mentions him in \"Cligès\" where he is defeated by Cligès in a joust. An abduction of the queen is one of the oldest motifs in Arthurian legend, appearing also in Caradoc of Llancarfan's \"Life of Gildas\", and carved on the archivolt in Modena Cathedral. After Chrétien's version became popular, it was incorporated into the Lancelot-Grail Cycle and eventually into Thomas Malory's influential \"Le Morte d'Arthur\".\n\nCourtly love was coined by the medievalist Gaston Paris in 1883 to help understand the relationship between Lancelot and Guinevere in \"Lancelot, The Knight of the Cart\". Alexander J. Denomy describes courtly love as, \"… a type of sensual love and what distinguishes it from other forms of sexual love, from mere passion… is its purpose or motive, its formal object, namely, the lover's progress and growth in natural goodness, merit, and worth.\" In the Knight of the Cart, Lancelot has become entranced by Guinevere and in more ways than one, is ruled by her. As the queen, Guinevere maintains power over the kingdom as well as Lancelot. When Meleagant questions their love and her adultery to the king, Lancelot challenges Meleagant to a battle to protect Guinevere’s honor. Lancelot has no shame in showing his affair with the queen, \"Lancelot’s love explodes into romance without any beginning revealed or end foretold, fully formed and symbolized by the extraordinary fullness of his heart.\" This introduction of the love affair between Guinevere and Lancelot appears in many other stories after this poem was written.\n\n\n (includes \"Lancelot\")\n"}

They regulated social, political, religious, and economic life in these areas. The laws are composed of myriad decrees issued over the centuries and the important laws of the 16th century, which attempted to regulate the interactions between the settlers and natives, such as the Laws of Burgos (1512) and the New Laws (1542).\n\nThroughout the 400 years of Spanish presence in these parts of the world, the laws were compiled several times, most notably in 1680 under Charles II in the \"Recopilación de las Leyes de los Reynos de Indias\" (Compilation of the Laws of the Kingdoms of the Indies). This became considered the classic collection of the laws, although later laws superseded parts of it, and other compilations were issued.\n\nThe Spanish Viceroyalties in the Americas sometimes generated conflicts between indigenous peoples \"('Natives' or 'Indians')\"and the Spanish colonists. The Spanish attempted to control the Natives to force their labor. At the same time, conflicts on policy and implementation occurred between the \"encomenderos\" and the Crown.\n\nTwo of the main sets of laws issued in the 16th century regulated Spanish interaction with the Native peoples, an issue about which the Crown quickly became concerned soon after the voyages of Christopher Columbus and his governorship. The Laws of Burgos (1512), signed by King Ferdinand II of Aragon, focused upon the welfare of the conquered native peoples. The issue was revisited after Bartolomé de las Casas brought attention to abuses being carried out by encomenderos. The Laws of Burgos were revised by the New Laws of 1542 issued by Carlos I and quickly revised again in 1552, after the laws met resistance from colonists. These were followed by the Ordinances Concerning Discoveries in 1573, which forbade any unauthorized operations against independent Native Americans.\n\nThe Valladolid debate (1550–1551) was the first moral debate in European history to discuss the rights and treatment of a colonized people by colonizers. Held in the Colegio de San Gregorio, in the Spanish city of Valladolid, it was a moral and theological debate about the colonization of the Americas, its justification for the conversion to Catholicism and more specifically about the relations between the European settlers and the natives of the New World. It consisted of a number of opposing views about the way natives were to be integrated into colonial life, their conversion to Christianity and their rights and obligations. According to the French historian Jean Dumont The Valladolid debate was a major turning point in world history \"“In that moment in Spain appeared the dawn of the human rights”\".\n\nTo guide and regularize the establishment of presidios (military towns), missions, and \"pueblos\" (civilian towns), King Phillip II developed the first version of the \"Laws of the Indies.\" This comprehensive guide was composed of 148 ordinances to aid colonists in locating, building, and populating settlements. They codified the city planning process and represented some of the first attempts at a general plan. Signed in 1573, the \"Laws of the Indies\" are considered the first wide-ranging guidelines towards design and development of communities. These laws were heavily influenced by Vitruvius' \"Ten Books of Architecture\" and Leon Battista Alberti's treatises on the subject.\n\nIn Book IV of the 1680 compilation of \"The Laws of the Indies,\" plans were set forth in detail on every facet of creating a community, including town planning. Examples of the range of rules include:\n\n\nThese rules are part of a body of 148 regulations configuring any settlement according to the rule of Spain and its colonies. This continued as a precedent in all towns under Spanish control until the relinquishing of the land to others, as in the case of the American colonies and their growth. The Laws of the Indies are still used as an example to design guidelines for communities today.\n\nThe Laws specify many details of towns. A plan is made centered on a Plaza Mayor (main square) of size within specified limits, from which twelve straight streets are built in a rectilinear grid. The directions of the streets are chosen according to the prevailing winds, to protect the Plaza Mayor. The guidelines recommend a hospital for non-contagious cases near the church, and one for contagious diseases further away.\n\nMost townships founded in any part of the Spanish Empire in America before the various parts became independent countries were planned according to the Laws. These include many townships with Spanish names located in what is now the United States. The creation of a central square and rectilinear grid of streets was different from the haphazard and organic growth that led to meandering streets in many old townships in Iberia.\n\n\n"}

In the southeast, it is separated from Guluwuru Island by \"Cumberland Strait\", which is 1600 metres wide at its narrowest point.\n\nThe island is a long and narrow island, 57.4 km long and maximally 8 km wide. It measures 210.9 km² in area. The most northerly point of the island is called Low Point. \"Sphinx Head\" is a site of conspicuous cliffs up to 67 metres high, about 16 km SSW of Low Point. Two flat-topped hills south of Sphinx Head rise to a maximum height of 79 metres. The entire east coast of the island is cliffy and high.\n\nAdministratively, Marchinbar Island is part of \"Gumurr Marthakal Ward\" of East Arnhem Region.\n\nThe only settlement is Martjanba, a small family outstation on Jensen Bay in the northern part of the island.\n\nMarchinbar Island was until recently the last habitat still containing a population of the golden bandicoot (\"Isoodon auratus\"), which was once found throughout northern, central and western Australia, and as far south as New South Wales. As part of a salvage operation to ensure diversification, numbers of the Marchinbar Island bandicoots have been translocated to the islands of Raragala and Guluwuru.\n\nIn 1944, nine coins were discovered at Djinjan creek immediately south of Jensen Bay. Four of the coins were later identified as Dutch duits dating from 1690 to the 1780s while five with Arabic inscriptions were identified as being from the Kilwa Sultanate of east Africa. Only one such Kilwan coin had ever previously been found outside east Africa (unearthed during an excavation in Oman). The inscriptions on the Jensen Bay coins identify a ruling Sultan of Kilwa, but it is unclear whether the ruler was from the 10th century or the 14th century. This discovery has been of interest to those historians who believe it likely that people made landfall in Australia or its offshore islands before the first generally accepted such discovery, by the Dutch sailor Willem Janszoon in 1606.\n\n\n"}

She was a major figure in several crucial moments of the 20th century academic community. A student of Federico Halbherr, she edited his works after his death. She was the first woman to lead archaeological excavations at the Vatican, succeeding Ludwig Kaas, and completed the excavations on Saint Peter's tomb, discovering relics she asserted were those of Saint Peter. She has asserted that the inscription on the Praeneste fibula is a forgery.\n\nShe was one of the top archaeologists of the Italian Archaeological Mission at Crete sponsored since 1910 by the Italian Archaeological School of Athens and in this capacity she published the work of Halbherr, her teacher – the \"Inscriptiones Creticæ\", which included inscriptions in Greek and Latin on the island of Crete. She also worked on excavating artifacts related to the Gortyn code and is most noted for her publications regarding that inscription.\n\nShe obtained the designation of \"docent\" for the teaching of Epigraphy and Ancient Greek at the University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", holding that position until 1973. She continued to teach at the National School of Archeology of Rome, where she was also director, until 1978. While teaching Greek epigraphy she wrote four volumes on the subject and a compendium covering it from its origins to the late Roman Empire. At the end of her academic career she was named Professor Emerita at the University La Sapienza.\n\nSince 1956 she was affiliated with the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, and appointed as a member of the Pontificia Accademia Romana di Archeologia in 1969.\n\nGuarducci received two honorary degrees from the Università Cattolica di Milano and the University of Rennes. Her works are now published by Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato.\n\nReceiving her diploma in Bologna in 1924, she attended the National School of Archeology in Rome from 1927 onwards, then proceeding to Athens. She was one of the first Italian women scholars to practice archaeology in Greece. She was appointed director of the Scuola Alessandro Della Seta and headed up the excavations on the island of Crete, a Greek territory since 1880.\n\nThere she met Federico Halbherr, a student of archeology from Florence's Domenico Comparetti. Guarducci began collaborating with Halbherr and became his favorite pupil during the excavations of the Cretan city of Gortyna. Her work there would continue after the death of Halbherr in 1930.\n\nAfter Halbherr's death, the project fell under the direction of the Cretan Louis Pernier. Guarducci, whose interests lay primarily in epigraphy, took on the task of completing Halbherr's life's work which was to compile a single work of the Greek and Latin inscriptions of Crete after the 7th century BC. She began a long period of reconnaissance throughout the island, verifying the accuracy of the earlier readings of Halbherr, making corrections and adding new information. She continued this work full-time until 1931 when she was appointed the chair of Ancient Greek epigraphy at the \"Università di Roma \"La Sapienza\"\" where she served until 1950. It was here she was to publish the result of twenty years of research entitled the \"Inscriptiones Creticæ\", which was published between 1935 and 1950. That work is considered the definitive collection of epigraphic entries, as well as the major compilation of the archeology and topography of the ancient city of Gortyna in Crete.\n\nThe work is in four volumes based on geography (Central Crete, Western Crete, Eastern Crete, and Gortyna), and bears the full title of \"Inscriptiones Creticæ, opera et consilio Friderici Halbherr collectae, Guarducci curavit Margarita\", and is written in Latin, as required by the tradition of epigraphic corpora compiled by 'Academy in Berlin in the 19th century. Individual volumes bear the following titles (with year of publication):\n\n\nEach volume is accompanied by an extensive bibliography divided into two sections: archaeology and epigraphs. Introductions explain archaeological, topographical, and antiquarian aspects of the areas treated. Entries include photographs, illustrations of epigraphs, transcripts, and extensive commentary.\n\nIn the fourth volume, which focuses on the city of Gortyna, Guarducci addresses the so-called \"Great Law (or Grand Inscription) of Gortyna\" (Inscr. Cret., Vol. IV, n.72), discovered by Federico Halbherr in 1884.\n\nThe inscription, part of a building used as the Odeon, is engraved on a concave wall about 8 m long and 175 cm high. It is grouped into twelve columns of boustrophedon writing. This is a type of writing that gradually alternates from left to right, writing a line backward, then reversing from right to left, for the entire text. It is likely that, on the left side of the wall, there were eight other columns which are now lost. This is not a real \"code of laws,\" but rather, with the Latin, a saturated \"legum\", i.e., a sparse collection of laws, updates of previous ancient laws and new laws focused on a specific topic. In the case of the \"Gortyn Code\", the laws shown are mostly family law, as well as regarding economics and commerce.\n\nGuarducci's long experience of teaching resulted in a work which is a now cornerstone in the teaching of Greek epigraphy: \"Epigrafia Greca\", published between 1967 and 1978. By the author's design, it not only caters to an audience of scientists of antiquity but also to a general audience of students, amateurs and novices. According to Guarducci, epigraphy \"is one of the most agile, fresh and fun disciplines of classical studies.\"\n\nThe work is in four volumes, differing in content as follows:\n\nThe work, in a clear and straightforward style, presents actual cases alongside theoretical explanations, providing the reader with a veritable \"small anthology\" of Greek inscriptions, with photographs, transcriptions, translations, commentary, and very often bibliographic references. Each volume includes a large bibliography. Because of a limited edition, the volumes of \"Epigrafia Greca\" were soon exhausted. Guarducci felt the need to put her hand to a fifth volume which would serve as a \"compendium\" for the previous four. It was published in 1987 as \"L'epigrafia greca dalle origini al tardo impero\" (Greek epigraphy from its origins to the late Empire).\n\n\n\n"}

According to Ayodeji Olukoju, the script certainly dates from after 1819, when Bukele returned to the interior of Liberia after a period of residence on the coast. The syllabary is supposed to have been revealed to him in a dream, and to have been communicated to friends and tribal elders.\n\nOlukoju argues that the original idea must have arisen from his experience of literacy in coastal Liberia during his sojourn there, and that the visionary experience described may have followed from a period of work on the idea. Tuchscherer and Hair (2002) have presented evidence that exposure to the Cherokee syllabary was part of the process.

Maksymovych also was a member of the Nestor the Chronicler Historical Association that existed in Kiev in 1872-1931.\n\nMaksymovych was born into an old Ukrainian Cossack family which owned a small estate on Mykhailova Hora near Prokhorivka, Zolotonosha county in Poltava Governorate (now in Cherkasy Oblast) in Left-bank Ukraine. After receiving his high school education at Novgorod-Severskiy Gymnasium, he studied natural science and philology at philosophy faculty of Moscow University and later the medical faculty, graduating with his first degree in 1823, his second in 1827; thereafter, he remained at the university in Moscow for further academic work in botany. In 1833 he received his doctorate and was appointed as a professor for the chair of botany in the Moscow University.\n\nHe taught biology and was director of the botanical garden at the university. During this period, he published extensively on botany and also on folklore and literature, and got to know many of the leading lights of Russian intellectual life including the Russian poet, Alexander Pushkin and Russian writer, Nikolay Gogol, and shared his growing interest in Cossack history with them.\n\nIn 1834, he was appointed professor of Russian literature at the newly created Saint Vladimir University in Kiev and also became the university's first rector, a post that he held until 1835. (This university had been established by the Russian government to reduce Polish influence in Ukraine and Maksymovych was, in part, an instrument of this policy). Maksymovych elaborated wide-ranging plans for the expansion of the university which eventually included attracting eminent Ukrainians and Russians like, Nikolay Kostomarov, and Taras Shevchenko to teach there.\n\nIn 1847, he was deeply affected by the arrest, imprisonment, and exile of the members of the Pan-Slavic Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius, many of whom, like the poet Taras Shevchenko, were his friends or students. Thereafter, he buried himself in scholarship, publishing extensively.\n\nIn 1853, he married, and in 1857, in hope of relieving his severe financial situation, went to Moscow to find work. In 1858, Shevchenko returning from exile, visited him in Moscow, and when Maksymovych returned to Mykhailova Hora, visited him there as well. At this time, Shevchenko painted portraits of both Maksimovich and his wife, Maria.\n\nDuring his final years, Maksimovich devoted himself more and more to history and engaged in extensive debates with the Russian historians Mikhail Pogodin and Nikolay Kostomarov.\n\nIn the 1820s and 1830s, Maksymovych published several textbooks on biology and botany. His first scholarly book on botany was published in 1823 under the title \"On the System of the Flowering Kingdom\". He also published popular works on botany for the layman. This \"populist\" approach to science, he carried over into his writings on folklore, literature, and history.\n\nIn 1833 in Moscow, he published \"The Book of Naum About God's Great World\", which was a popularly written exposition of geology, the solar system, and the universe, in religious garb for the common folk. This book proved to be a best-seller and went through eleven editions, providing Maksimovich with some royalties for many long years.\n\nAlso in 1833, Maksymovych published \"A Letter on Philosophy\" which reflected his admiration for Schelling's \"Nature-Philosophy.\" In this letter, he declared that true philosophy was based on love and that all branches of organized, systematic knowledge, which strove to recognize the internal meaning and unity of things, but most especially history, were philosophy. With his emphasis upon history, Maksimovich approached the views of Baader and Hegel as well as Schelling.\n\nIn 1827, Maksymovych published \"Little Russian Folksongs\" which was one of the first collections of folk songs published in eastern Europe. It contained 127 songs, including historical songs, songs about every-day life, and ritual songs. The collection marked a new turning to the common people, the folk, which was the hallmark of the new romantic era which was then beginning. Everywhere that it was read, it aroused the interest of the literate classes in the life of the common folk. In 1834 and in 1849, Maksymovych published two further collections.\n\nIn his collections of folksongs, Maksymovych used a new orthography for the Ukrainian language which was based on etymology. Although this \"Maksymovychivka\" looked quite similar to Russian, it was a first step towards an independent orthography, based on phonetics which was eventually proposed by Maksimovich's younger contemporary, Panteleimon Kulish. The latter forms the basis of the modern written Ukrainian language.\n\nIn general, Maksymovych claimed to see some basic psychological differences, reflecting differences in national character, between Ukrainian and Russian folk songs; he thought the former more spontaneous and lively, the latter more submissive. Such opinions were shared by many of his contemporaries such as his younger contemporary, the historian Nikolay Kostomarov and others.\n\nIn 1856, Maksymovych published the first part of his \"Days and Months of the Ukrainian Villager\" which summed up many years of observation of the Ukrainian peasantry. In it, he laid out the folk customs of the Ukrainian village according to the calendar year. (The full work was only published in Soviet times.)\n\nIn 1839, Maksymovych published his \"History of Old Russian Literature\" which dealt with the so-called Kievan period of Russian literature. Maksymovych saw a definite continuity between the language and literature of Ruthenia (Kievan Rus') and that of Cossack period. Indeed, he seems to have thought that the Old Ruthenian language stood in relation to modern Russian in a way similar to that of Old Czech to modern Polish or modern Slovak; that is, that one influenced but was not the same as the other. Later on, he also translated the epic \"Tale of Igor's Campaign\" into both modern Russian and modern Ukrainian verse. Maksimovich's literary works included poetry and almanacs with much material devoted to Russia.\n\nFrom the 1850s to the 1870s, Maksymovych worked extensively in history, especially Russian and Ukrainian history. He was critical of the Normanist Theory which traced Kievan Rus to Scandinavian origins, preferring to stress its Slavic roots. But he opposed the Russian historian, Mikhail Pogodin, who believed that Kievan Rus originally had been populated by Great Russians from the north. Maksimovich argued that the Kievan lands were never completely de-populated, even after the Mongol invasions, and that they had always been inhabited by Ruthenians and their direct ancestors. As well, he was the first to claim the \"Lithuanian period\" for Russian history. Maksymovych also worked on the history of the city of Kiev, of Cossack Hetmanate, of the uprising of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Haidamak uprisings against Poland, and other subjects. In general, he sympathized with these various Cossack rebels, so much so, in fact, that his first work on the Haidamaks was banned by the Russian censor. Many of his most important works were critical studies and corrections of the publications of other historians, like Mikhail Pogodin and Nikolay Kostomarov.\n\nWith regard to Slavic studies, Maksimovich remarked upon the various theses of the Czech philologist, Josef Dobrovský and the Slovak scholar, Pavel Jozef Šafárik. Like them, he divided the Slavic family into two major groups, a western group and an eastern group. But then he sub-divided the western group into two further parts: a north-western group and a south-western group. (Dobrovsky had lumped the Russians together with the South Slavs.) Maksymovych particularly objected to Dobrovsky's contention that the major eastern or Russian group was unified, without major divisions or dialects. This eastern group, Maksymovych divided into two independent languages, South Russian and North Russian. The South Russian language, he divided into two major dialects, Ruthenian and Red Ruthenian/Galician. The North Russian language, he divided into four major dialects of which he thought the Muscovite the most developed, but also the youngest. In addition to this, he also seems to have considered Belarusian to be an independent language, intermediate between North and South Russian, but much closer to the former. Writing at the beginning of the twentieth century, the Croatian scholar, V. Jagic, thought Maksimovich's scheme to have been a solid contribution to Slavic philology.\n\nMaksymovych also argued in favour of the independent origin of the spoken Old Rus languages, thinking them separate from the book language of the time which was based on Church Slavonic. Maksimovich also made some critical remarks on Pavel Jozef Šafárik's map of the Slavic world, wrote on the Lusatian Sorbs, and on Polish proverbs. Maksimovich, as well, wrote a brief autobiography which was first published in 1904. His correspondence was large and significant.\n\nMaksymovych was a pioneer of his time and, in many ways, one of the last of the \"universal men\" who were able to contribute original works to both the sciences and the humanities. His works in biology and the physical sciences reflected a concern for the common man - love for his fellow human being, Schelling's philosophy, at work - and his works in literature, folklore, and history, often phrased in terms of friendly public \"letters\" to his scholarly opponents, pointed to new directions in telling the story of the common people. In doing this, however, Maksymovych \"awakened\" new national sentiments among his fellows, especially the younger generation. He greatly influenced many of his younger contemporaries including the poet Taras Shevchenko, the historian Nikolay Kostomarov, the writer Panteleimon Kulish, and many others.\n\nThe library of Kiev University is named in his honour.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50919806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50919806", "title": "Ogdoad (Egyptian)", "text": "Ogdoad (Egyptian)\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, the Ogdoad ( \"the Eightfold\"; , a plural nisba of \"eight\") were eight primordial deities worshipped in Hermopolis.\n\nReferences to the Ogdoad date to the Old Kingdom of Egypt, and even at the time of composition of the Pyramid Texts towards the end of the Old Kingdom, they appear to have been antiquated and mostly forgotten by everyone except religious experts. They are frequently mentioned in the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom. The oldest known pictorial representations of the group do not predate the time of Seti I (New Kingdom, 13th century BC), when the group appears to be rediscovered by the theologians of Hermopolis for the purposes of a more elaborate creation account.\n\nTexts of the Late Period describe them as having the heads of frogs (male) and serpents (female), and they are often depicted in this way in reliefs of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. \n\nE. A. Wallis Budge (1904) compares the concept to a group of four pairs of primeval gods mentioned in the Babylonian \"Enûma Eliš\", viz. Abzu and Tiamat, Lahmu and Lahamu, Anshar and Kishar, Anu and Nudimmud.\n\nBudge also argues that the Ogdoad is the original \"company of gods\" or \"pꜣwt nṯrw\", represented by nine \"axes\" or \"flagpoles\" (the hieroglyph sign for \"god\", N10:t-R8*R8*R8*R8*R8*R8*R8*R8*R8),arrived at by augmenting the original Ogdoad by the local chief deity of Heliopolis, Tem, by the authors of the theological system reflected in the Pyramid Texts.\n\nThe eight deities were arranged in four male-female pairs (the female names being merely derivative female forms of the male names), as follows:\n\nThe names of Nu and Nut are written with the determiners for sky and water, and it seems clear that they represent the primordial waters.\n\nThe fourth pair appears with varying names, sometimes the name \"Qerḥ\" is replaced by \"Ni, Nenu, Nut, or Amun\", and the name \"Qerḥet\" by \"Ennit, Nenuit, Nut, Nit, or Amunet\". The common meaning of \"qerḥ\" is \"night\", but the determinative (D41 for \"to halt, stop, deny\") also suggests the principle of inactivity or repose.\n\nḤeḥu and Ḥeḥut have no readily identifiable determiners; according to a suggestion due to Brugsch (1885), the name is associated with a term for an undefined or unlimited number, \"ḥeḥ\", suggesting a concept similar to Greek \"aion\". But from the context of a number of passages in which Ḥeḥu is mentioned, Brugsch also suggested that he may be a personification of the atmosphere between heaven and earth (c.f. \"Shu\").\n\nThe names of Kekui and Kekuit are written with a determiner combining the sky hieroglyph with a staff or scepter used for words related to darkness and obscurity, and \"kkw\" as a regular word means \"darkness\", suggesting that these gods represent primordial darkness, comparable to Greek Erebus, but in some aspects they appear to represent day as well as night, or the change from night to day and from day to night.\n\nThe fourth pair has no consistent attributes as it appears with varying names. The common meaning of \"qerḥ\" is \"night\", but the determinative (D41 for \"to halt, stop, deny\") also suggests the principle of inactivity or repose.\n\nThere is no obvious way to allot or attribute four functions to the four pairs of gods, and it seems clear that \"the ancient Egyptians themselves had no very clear idea\" regarding such functions. \nNevertheless, there have been attempts to assign \"four ontological concepts\"\nto the four groups.\nFor example, in the context of the New Kingdom, Karenga (2004) uses \"fluidity\" (for \"flood, waters\"), \"darkness\", \"unboundedness\" and \"invisibility\" (for \"repose, inactivity\").\n\n"}

His father died in 1689 so he temporarily came under the protection of the Amsterdam poet William Sewell. In 1695, they moved to the Hague and his mother began a linen business. Pieter became a weaver and pattern draughtsman and joined artist circles, where he began to write poetry.\n\nAround 1708 Pieter took a course in drawing and painting with Frans van Steenwijk. On his 28th birthday his \"Don Quichot op de Bruiloft van Kamacho\" appeared. It proved a success and began a permanent run at the Schouwberg of Van Campen. The farces \"De zwetser\" and \"The mutual marriage-deception\" appeared the next year.\n\nPieter wrote yet more comedies in the style of Molière, who he also translated and wrote about. With Hermanus Angelkot, he wrote \"Cato\", dedicated to the mayor Nicolaes Witsen. \"Quincampoix, or the gamblers on the Stock Exchange\" became very famous, written in the notorious year 1720 that John Law ruined many investors in Paris. \"Arlequin Actionist\" was a commedia dell'arte farce on the stockjobbery, one act long, with a real fight, dance and music.\nIn 1721 he became \"Factor\" of the Haarlem Society Trou Moet Blycken and he moved back to Haarlem with his mother in 1722. In the same year he was appointed as city-artist to Haarlem, and wrote yearly poems for the city from 1724-1744. He had a house outside the city, while he could still get out the city. After his mother died in 1727, he married a sickly and moody woman who died eleven years later. In 1747, he had to sell a large part of its books and possessions. Pieter lived in Haarlem's Proveniershuis, where he was given free accommodation in return for writing a history of the city. The previous description of the city was from 1628, written by Samuel Ampzing. On his sickbed he wanted to be baptized at home, and \"only five days did Pieter survive after this religious performance...\"\n\nPieter wrote five pieces of comparable length, in which symmetry played a role. With exposition, intrigue and crisis, he respected the unities of time, place and action, using this classicist form to hold a mirror up to the bourgeoisie. Nowhere did the tone become moralizing, but was more a \"comedy of manners\" (comédies des moeurs), showing the hypocrisy of those in the higher positions (i.e., the higher bourgeoisie or the impoverished middle-classes). Pieter wrote only a single tragedy, at the end of his life.\n\nIn this comedy, Lodewijk meets Charlotte. Lodewijk is an aristocrat, in great financial difficulties but acting as if he is a rich Polish count. He has a friend called Jan, who proposes to act out one of his barons, so to flirt with the maid of Charlotte: Klaartje. Jan served under Karel in the army, but left as a traitor. Charlotte also comes from the impoverished aristocracy, and acts as if her situation is more prosperous as well. It is very comical to see how both sides try to convince the other that they are extremely wealthy. This 'mutual marriage deception' comes to light when Karel, the brother of Charlotte, unmasks everybody at the theatre. Charlotte and Lodewijk get married anyway, because they have fallen in love with each other. As for Klaartje and Jan, she is disgusted with Jan for lying to her, so she breaks up with him. After that, she tries to get back with her former lover, Hans (who she broke up with when Jan started flirting with her) but he wants nothing of her. In the end, the traitor Jan takes flight from the group, as to avoid punishment from his captain: Karel.\n\nThis work also holds up a mirror to the audience. Two generations are placed opposite each other: those born in the 17th and 18th centuries. Ernst and Hendrik are conscientious seventeenth-century merchants who, through hard work, gain position. Their sons represent the following, 18th century generations, and are called Lichthart (light heart), husband to Kwistgoed, and Losbol (loose-liver), husband of Zoetje. They waste all the money that their fathers have made and the whole family fortune is lost.\n\nBundle of his yearly poems for the city of Haarlem, which formed a series on the Counts of Holland, were compiled with engravings by his nephew Hendrik Spilman in 1745.\n\nHis work on the history of Haarlem was never published, but his manuscript was used by Gerrit Willem van Oosten de Bruyn in 1765.\n\n\n"}

Cárcano\n\nRamón José Cárcano (April 18, 1860 — June 2, 1946) was an Argentine lawyer, historian and politician who served as Governor of Córdoba from 1913 to 1916, and from 1925 to 1928.\n\nJosé Ramón Carcano was born in Córdoba, Argentina in 1860 to Honoria César and Innocencio Cárcano. His father, who descended from a family of landowners in the Lombardy Region of Italy, emigrated to Argentina for political reasons in 1849. The younger Cárcano attended the Colegio Nacional de Monserrat, and later enrolled at the National University of Córdoba Law School, graduating in 1881. His doctoral thesis, \"Of Natural Children, Adultery, Incest and Sacrilege,\" advocated equality between legitimate and illegitimate children, and sparked public debate, as well as \"ad hominem\" attacks by the Bishop of Córdoba.\n\nHe began his career in public service in 1880 as private secretary to Governor Miguel Juárez Celman. He taught as Professor of Commercial Law at the University of Córdoba from 1882 to 1884, when he was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies for the province. Governor Olmos appointed Cárcano Minister of Justice, Culture and Education, and Juárez Celman, who was elected President of Argentina in 1886, appointed him Director General of Post and Telegraph Office the following year. Cárcano initiated plans for a new central post office for the rapidly growing city of Buenos Aires, and in 1888, the President signed a congressional bill for its construction. The structure, ultimately completed in 1928, served as the Buenos Aires Central Post Office until 2005.\nHe married Ana Sáenz de Zumarán in 1887, and they had three children. Following Juárez Celman's resignation in 1890, Cárcano toured Europe, returning in 1891 to his estancia on the banks of the Tercero River. There, he introduced Polled Durham cattle, a vaccine against anthrax that had been prepared at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and an imported steam plough (becoming the first landowner in Argentina to use these innovations). Cárcano wrote numerous historical works during this period, notably \"El general Quiroga y la expedición al desierto\" (1882), \"Perfiles contemporáneos\" (1885), \"La universidad de Córdoba\" (1892), \"Historia de los medios de comunicación y transporte en la Argentina\" (1893), \"Estudios coloniales\" (1895), and \"La reforma universitaria\" (1901), and was inducted into the National Academy of History of Argentina in 1901. Named President of the Agricultural Education Advisory Commission in 1907, he joined the Higher Institute of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine, becoming the school's first dean upon its 1909 incorporation into the University of Buenos Aires. Among his best-known works outside the subject of history was \"Evolución histórica del régimen de la tierra pública\", a study on eminent domain.\n\nCárcano was again elected to Congress in 1910. He served as President of the Constitutional Convention of the Province of Córdoba in 1912, and briefly as Federal Receiver of San Juan Province in 1913. He was then elected Governor of Córdoba, and took office on May 17. His administration, which lasted until 1916, promoted agricultural mechanization and improved the provincial road network. He continued to write, publishing among others \"La misión Mitre en el Brasil\" (1913), \"De Caseros al 11 de Septiembre\" (1919), \"Del sitio de Buenos Aires al Campo de Cepeda\" (1921), and \"Juan Facundo Quiroga\", for which he won a National Literary Prize in 1931. Cárcano returned as Dean of the University of Buenos Aires School of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine from 1921 to 1924, and twice served as President of the National Academy of History.\n\nHe was re-elected Governor of Córdoba for a three-year term in 1925, during which tenure the provincial seal of Córdoba (based on a design first used in 1573) was instituted. A conservative politician in the National Autonomist Party tradition that typified most Argentine landowners, Cárcano joined the center-right Concordance alliance as a National Democrat, serving in the Agustín Justo administration as Chairman of the National Council of Education in 1932, and as Ambassador to Brazil between 1933 and 1938. He then retired from public service, and published his memoirs, \"Mis primeros 80 años\" (\"My First 80 Years\"), in 1943.\n\nCárcano died in Córdoba in 1946, at age 86.\n"}

Ylanan (7 September 1889 – 1963) was a Filipino athlete, physician, sports administrator, physical educator, and sports historian. He rose to fame with three gold medals in track and field at the 1913 Far Eastern Championship Games in Manila. He won two further medals at the 1915 Games and also represented his country in baseball at three editions of the tournament.\n\nHe was a founder of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the Philippines in 1924. A doctor of medicine and surgeon by training, in 1930 he became the first Filipino to gain a physical education degree from the United States. At age 30 he was appointed head of physical education at the University of the Philippines – the country's first and most prestigious university. He later served as national sports director and was a long-standing secretary-treasurer for the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (a forerunner to the national Olympic committee). He coached David Nepomuceno—the country's first Olympian in 1928—and was the Filipino head of delegation for the 1936 Berlin Olympics.\n\nYlanan helped develop sports in the Philippines, with a focus on Western sports such as baseball, basketball and track and field. He developed a national sports programme, assisted in the building of the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex and wrote several works on sport, including a book which was posthumously published.\n\nBorn in Bogo, Cebu, Ylanan attended at Cebu City high school and played baseball for the institution as a catcher. He continued to play the sport while studying to be a doctor at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine.\n\nReaching his twenties, he enjoyed his first experience of high level sport in 1911 when he was named in the all-Filipino national baseball team as a center fielder. Despite his early baseball success, it was in track and field that Ylanan made his impact as an athlete.\n\nYlanan was selected to represent the Philippines at the inaugural Far Eastern Championship Games in 1913 in the athletics competition. At the event in Manila, his throwing abilities from playing baseball translated into success in the shot put and the discus throw, events which he won with marks of and , respectively. He won a third athletics gold medal in the pentathlon, making him the top performing athlete at the competition and a key figure in securing the athletics title for the Philippines. Still a student, he returned for the 1915 Games held in Shanghai and defended his shot put title with an improved throw of . Although he didn't match the success of his first appearance, he did reach the podium for a second time in the form of a pentathlon bronze medal. The Philippines won the championship title for second time, although it was Genaro Saavedra that led the charge this time as he took four gold medals in total. Ylanan competed one further time at the competition, playing as catcher for the Filipino baseball team at the 1917 Far Eastern Championship Games.\n\nHe focused on his studies thereafter and graduated as a doctor of medicine from University of the Philippines in 1918. He practised as a surgeon at the Philippine General Hospital but ultimately his interest lay in sports. The national bureau of education sent him to Springfield College in Massachusetts and graduated from the American school with a degree in physical education in 1920, his thesis being \"The relation of Exercise to Growth and Development\". This made him the first Filipino to earn the qualification. This experience quickly accelerated a career in sports administration and he was appointed as the director of physical education at the University of the Philippines that same year. He acted as head of that university department for seven years. He served as the head coach for the Filipino baseball team at the 1921 and 1923 Far Eastern Championship Games; the team won the title in both years.\n\nWestern sports were becoming increasingly popular during the period of American influence and the American-educated Ylanan fostered the development of such sports. In 1924 he coached David Nepomuceno, a sprinter who, at the 1924 Paris Olympics, became the first ever Filipino Olympian as the country sent a two-man delegation comprising Ylanan as the sole official and Nepomuceno as the sole athlete. He also helped create the National Collegiate Athletic Association that year, representing the University of the Philippines among the seven founding colleges in the national sports league. The league went on to be highly influential in the development of sport in the Philippines.\n\nYlanan headed the Filipino delegation for the 1925 Far Eastern Championship Games in Manila. Around this time he began publishing written works on the subject of sport, including an early summary of running technique and form in the \"Philippine Education Magazine\" in 1926. In 1927 he was promoted to the position of national athletic director and also the position of secretary-treasurer for the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation – the country's leading sports organisation. He acted in the latter position for over twenty years. Working alongside Jorge B. Vargas, the organisation's president, his achievements during his tenure included a ten-year national plan for athletic centres to train youths and the building of the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex on the old Manila Carnival grounds as the main stadium for the 1934 Far Eastern Championship Games, which was the tenth and final edition of the competition. He was the chief medic for the 1928 Olympic Philippines team and then the head of the national delegation at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, where Miguel White won the country's second ever Olympic athletics medal in the hurdles.\n\nRegional sports competition declined shortly afterwards given the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. He remained an authority on sports in the country, in capacities as an administrator, writer and medic. He documented the continued rise of basketball in the Philippines in the 1940s, as well as the development of baseball in the country on which he remarked that it \"seemed to fill a long-felt want with the Filipino\".\n\nHe was given several awards posthumously, including honours from the Philippine Sports Writers Association and a YMCA Triangle Award. In 1999 he was awarded the title of \"Sports Leader of the Millenium\" by the Philippine Sportswriters Association.\n"}

In 1936 it was presented in Paris and at London's Gate Theatre Studio.\n\nTwo women, Karen Wright and Martha Dobie, have worked hard to build a girls' boarding school in a refurbished farmhouse. They run and teach the school with the somewhat unwelcome help of Lily Mortar, Martha's aunt. One pupil, Mary Tilford, is mischievous, disobedient, and untruthful, and often leads the other girls into trouble.\nOne day, when Mary feigns illness and is being examined by Dr. Joe Cardin, a physician who is Mary's cousin and also Karen's fiancé, Martha asks Lily whether she would like to go back to traveling to the places she misses, now that they can afford it. Lily becomes angry and starts shouting about how, whenever Joe is around, Martha becomes irritable, unreasonable and jealous, taking her jealousy of Joe out on her. Two of Mary's friends, listening at the door trying to discover Mary's condition, overhear Lily's outburst.\n\nMary is found healthy and is sent to her room and squeezes the information out of the girls. Mary plans to ask her grandmother, Amelia Tilford—who not only indulges her but who also helped Karen and Martha a great deal in setting up the school—to allow her not to return. When Amelia refuses, Mary cleverly twists what the girls had overheard. With the help of several well-crafted lies and a book that the girls have been reading in secret, Mary convinces her grandmother that Karen and Martha are having a lesbian affair. On hearing this, Amelia Tilford begins contacting the parents of Mary's classmates. Shortly, most of Mary's friends have been pulled out of school. Rosalie Wells, a student whose mother is abroad, stays with Mary.\n\nOn discovering that Rosalie is vulnerable, Mary blackmails her into corroborating everything she says. When Karen and Martha realize why all their pupils were pulled out of their school in a single night, they go to Mrs. Tilford's residence to confront her. Amelia tells Mary to repeat her story. When Karen points out an inconsistency, Mary pretends to have been covering for Rosalie, who reluctantly corroborates Mary's story for fear of being exposed herself. Resolving to take Amelia to court, Martha and Karen leave.\n\nSeven months later, after Martha and Karen have lost the case, everyone still believes that they were lovers. When Lily returns from abroad to take care of her niece, the women are angry with her for not having stayed in the country in order to testify to their innocence. Meanwhile, Joe, who has remained loyal throughout, has found a job in a distant location. He tries to convince Karen and Martha to come with him and start over. As Martha goes to prepare dinner, Joe continues his attempts to persuade Karen, who now believes that she has ruined his life and destroyed everything that she and Martha had worked so hard to achieve.\n\nAt Karen's insistence, Joe reluctantly asks her whether she and Martha had ever been lovers. When Karen says that they were not, he readily believes her. Nevertheless, Karen decides that she and Joe must part. She explains that things can never be the same between them after all that they have been through. She asks Joe to leave and he refuses. He agrees to leave if Karen will think things through before finalizing the break-up. When Martha returns and finds out from Karen what has happened, she is consumed with guilt. Her discovery that she might indeed have feelings for Karen overwhelms and terrifies her. Before Martha tells Karen how she feels, Karen tells Martha that she would like to relocate in the morning and wants her to come with her. Martha says it's impossible for them to live comfortably again and eventually admits her feelings for Karen. Karen responds dismissively, saying that they never felt this way for each other. Martha continues, but Karen tells Martha that she is tired and they can talk about it in the morning. As Karen sits in her room, she hears a shot. Martha has killed herself. Shortly after, Amelia Tilford arrives to beg Karen's forgiveness, since Mary's lies have now been uncovered. Karen explains to her that it is too late: Mary's lies, together with the community's willingness to believe and spread malicious gossip, have destroyed three innocent lives.\n\nAfter her graduation from New York University, Lillian Hellman was a play reader in the office of theatrical producer Herman Shumlin. In May 1934 Hellman asked Shumlin to read a play of her own—the sixth draft of \"The Children's Hour\". He read it as she waited. After he read the first act Shumlin said, \"Swell\". After reading the second act he said, \"I hope it keeps up\". After reading the third act he said, \"I'll produce it.\"\n\nShumlin and Hellman worked through the details of the production together over the next months. Shumlin felt the title of the play was misleading and wanted Hellman to change it; but Hellman loved it and refused. Hellman recalled being rudely treated by Lee Shubert, then-owner of the Maxine Elliott Theatre, at a rehearsal. Shumlin faced Shubert down and barked, \"That girl, as you call her, is the author of the play.\"\n\nAfter writing one unsuccessful play with Louis Kronenberger, Hellman wrote \"The Children's Hour\" as an exercise, to teach herself how to write a play. Believing that she would do better to find a subject based in fact, Dashiell Hammett suggested the idea for the play to Hellman after he read a book titled \"Bad Companions\" (1930), a true-crime anthology by William Roughead. It related an incident that took place in 1810 at a school in Edinburgh, Scotland. A student named Jane Cumming accused her schoolmistresses, Jane Pirie and Marianne Woods, of having an affair in the presence of their pupils. Dame Cumming Gordon, the accuser's influential grandmother, advised her friends to remove their daughters from the boarding school. Within days the school was deserted and the two women had lost their livelihood. Pirie and Woods sued and eventually won, both in court and on appeal, but given the damage done to their lives, their victory was considered hollow.\n\nProduced and directed by Herman Shumlin, \"The Children's Hour\" opened November 20, 1934, at the Maxine Elliott Theatre in New York City. The settings by Aline Bernstein were executed by Sointu Syrjala. The three-act drama closed in July 1936 after 691 performances.\n\n\nThe financial and critical success of the New York production encouraged Shumlin to present \"The Children's Hour\" in other cities. In December 1935, authorities in Boston declared that the play did not meet the standards of the Watch and Ward Society and that it could not be performed there the following month as scheduled. Shumlin filed a $250,000 suit for damages, but in February 1936 a Federal judge refused to prevent the city from interfering in the presentation of the play. In January 1936, a municipal censorship ordinance was used to decline granting a performance permit for \"The Children's Hour\" in Chicago.\n\n\"Les Innocentes\", André Bernheim's French-language translation of \"The Children's Hour\", was first presented April 21, 1936, at the Théâtre des Arts in Paris. Although the Lord Chamberlain banned the public performance of \"The Children's Hour\" in Great Britain in March 1935, the play was presented in its entirety on November 12, 1936, at a private performance at the Gate Theatre Studio in London, managed by Norman Marshall.\n\nScreenwriter and playwright Paddy Chayefsky considered \"The Children's Hour\" to be one of the most carefully structured plays ever written, and learned play-structure in his youth by copying in longhand the entire script.\n\n\"The Children's Hour\" was in serious consideration for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for 1934–35. The award was presented instead to Zoë Akins' play \"The Old Maid\". Accused of rejecting Hellman's play because of its controversial subject—one of the Pulitzer judges had refused to see it—the selection committee replied that \"The Children's Hour\" was not eligible for the award because it was based on a court case and was therefore not an original drama. Critics responded that since \"The Old Maid\" was based on a novella by Edith Wharton, it also should have been deemed ineligible. Angered by the Pulitzer Prize decision, the New York Drama Critics' Circle began awarding its own annual prize for drama the following year.\n\nLillian Hellman directed a Broadway revival of \"The Children's Hour\", produced by Kermit Bloomgarden and presented December 18, 1952 – May 30, 1953, at the Coronet Theatre. The cast included Kim Hunter as Karen Wright, Patricia Neal as Martha Dobie, Iris Mann as Mary Tilford, and Katherine Emmet reprising her original role as Mrs. Amelia Tilford. The revised stage production was construed as an implied criticism of the House Un-American Activities Committee.\n\nIn 2008 Sarah Frankcom directed a production at the Royal Exchange in Manchester. It starred Maxine Peake (who won a MEN Award) as Karen Wright, Charlotte Emmerson as Martha Dobie, Kate O'Flynn (who won a TMA Award) as Mary Tilford and Milo Twomey as Dr Joseph Cardin.\n\nA revival starring Keira Knightley and Elisabeth Moss, directed by Ian Rickson, was presented at London's Harold Pinter Theatre January 22 – May 7, 2011.\n\nIn 1936, the play was made into a film directed by William Wyler. However, because of the Production Code, the story was adapted into a heterosexual love triangle, the controversial name of the play was changed, and the movie was eventually released as \"These Three\". Hellman reportedly worked on the screenplay, keeping virtually all of the play's original dialogue, and was satisfied with the result, saying the play's central theme of gossip was unaffected by the changes.\n\nIn 1961, the play was adapted, with its lesbian theme intact, for the film \"The Children's Hour\", also directed by Wyler and starring Audrey Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine, and James Garner. In the UK, New Zealand and Australia it was released under the title \"The Loudest Whisper\".\n\nIn 1971 the play was produced for the radio by the BBC in its Saturday Night Theatre series starring Jill Bennett and Prunella Scales.\n\nIn 1994 the play was again produced for the radio by the BBC in its Monday Play series, starring Clare Holman, Buffy Davis, Miriam Margolyes and Margaret Robertson.\n\n"}
{"id": "42627225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42627225", "title": "Theodore Spandounes", "text": "Theodore Spandounes\n\nTheodore Spandounes (, ) was an early 16th-century Greek historian of noble Byzantine extraction, the son of exiles fleeing the Ottoman conquest of Byzantium who had settled in Venice in Italy. As a youth he stayed with relatives in Ottoman-ruled Macedonia and visited the Ottoman capital at Constantinople, acquiring a knowledge of their history and culture. In later life he served successive Popes as a counsellor and repeatedly advocated the dispatch of a new Crusade against the Ottomans. His chief legacy is his Italian-language history on the origins of the Ottoman state and its history up to that time, whose first version was published in 1509 in Italian and was soon translated into French. Spandounes continued working on it, with the final version appearing in 1538. The work is disorganized and contains errors, but is extremely valuable as a historical source for its wealth of information.\n\nTheodore Spandounes was most probably born in Venice, the son of Matthew Spandounes and Eudokia Kantakouzene. His father was a Greek soldier who entered the service of the Venetian Republic as a \"stradioti\" mercenary, and for unspecified exploits was raised to the title of Count and Imperial Knight of the Holy Roman Empire by Emperor Frederick III in 1454. He was also given a grant of land around the town of Loidoriki in Greece. This was a nominal grant meant as a gesture of honour, since the territory in question was under Ottoman control, but according to historian Donald Nicol it is possibly indicative of the Matthew's and his family's place of origin. On the other hand, both Spandounes and other members of the family still remaining in the Ottoman-ruled Balkans claimed descent from Constantinople itself, while some had settled in Venice as early as the 1370s. Theodore's mother was a descendant of the Kantakouzenoi, one of the most notable late Byzantine aristocratic lines, which had produced a number of emperors as well as rulers of the Despotate of the Morea in the Peloponnese. Apart from Theodore, the couple had at least two more children: a daughter, who married the Venetian citizen Michael Trevisan, and a son, Alexander, who became a merchant.\n\nThrough his mother, Theodore had relatives among the powerful Christian families of the late Byzantine/early Ottoman era. His mother was the grand-daughter of George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos. George was a cousin of the last two Byzantine emperors, John VIII Palaiologos and Constantine XI Palaiologos, while his sisters Irene and Helena married the Serbian Despot Đurađ Branković and the Emperor of Trebizond David respectively, another sister became the wife of King George VIII of Georgia, while one of George's daughters, Anna, married Vladislav Hercegović, Duke of Saint Sava. The Spandounes family also had influential members in the early Ottoman Balkans, most notably the wealthy merchant Loukas Spandounes in Thessalonica, who on his death in 1481 was buried in a splendid, Italianate (and probably built in and transported all the way from Venice) tomb in Hagios Demetrios. Although Theodore too had dealings with Thessalonica, however, he does not mention Loukas.\n\nTheodore's mother died sometime before 1490, and his father sent Theodore, then still a child, to live with his great-aunt, Mara Branković. Mara was the daughter of Đurađ and Irene, who had been taken as one of the wives of the Ottoman Sultan Murad II. After Murad's death in 1451, Mara was allowed by her stepson Sultan Mehmed II, to retire to her estate at Ježevo, where she \"maintained a privileged and protected enclave of Christian faith\" (Nicol). It was in this \"exalted and privileged\" environment that Theodore was brought up, and it was there that he learned to speak some Turkish and acquired first-hand knowledge of Turkish customs and history. In 1503, he visited the Ottoman capital of Constantinople to aid his brother Alexander, who had been brought to financial ruin by the recently concluded Ottoman–Venetian war and the Ottomans' confiscation of Venetian goods. Upon his arrival, he found that his brother had died in the meantime. From 1509, he was forced to leave Venice and live in exile in France. It was during this exile that he composed the first draft of his history, which he dedicated to King Louis XII. This first version was translated into French by Balarin de Raconis in 1519, and was published in a modern edition in 1896 by C. H. A. Schéfer.\n\nA devout but not dogmatic Christian, Spandounes was more attuned to Italian Renaissance humanism than religion. Conscious of his imperial Byzantine heritage, he was still \"not unduly bigoted\" against the Turks, having lived among them and come to know them. Nevertheless, the main aim of his work was to alert Western Christendom to the Turkish menace and rally it to a crusade to liberate his homeland. Despite 19th-century attempts to claim Spandounes for Greek nationalism, however, his cause was not limited to the Greek-speaking lands: Spandounes used the term \"Greece\" for the entirety of Europe, juxtaposed to Asia (perhaps echoing the Turkish division of Christian Rumelia from Muslim Anatolia), and saw himself as a defender of all of Christian Europe, not simply in the service of a particular nation. Although he remained an Orthodox Christian, Spandounes turned to the Roman Catholic Church for aid, and served as advisor and confidante to several Popes who would champion his cause, starting with Leo X (1513–21), for whom he prepared the second draft of his work in 1519. He fell out with Leo's successor, Pope Hadrian VI, who not only showed no interest in the war against the Turks, but also cut his family's pension, but resumed his position under Clement VII (1523–34) and Paul III (1534–49). In 1538 he produced the third and final version of his work, which he presented (in a French translation), to the French Dauphin, the future King Henry II of France. This version was published at Lucca in 1550 and—with many errors—at Florence in 1551, reprinted in 1654, and formed the basis for the first modern edition by the Greek scholar Konstantinos Sathas in 1890.\n\nSpandounes seems to have based his work on oral or documentary material available to him and his family, as well as unspecified \"Turkish annals\", but it is impossible to say which. There is notably almost no reference to the other post-1453 Greek historians, which as Nicol notes is possibly due to the fact that their works were not disseminated in printed form until much later. Likewise there is little to suggest that he knew and made use of the handful of Italian treatises on the Turks that were written at about the same time, except for the works of Marin Barleti, whom Spandounes mentions by name.\n\n"}
{"id": "40471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40471", "title": "Thessaloniki", "text": "Thessaloniki\n\nThessaloniki (, \"Thessaloníki\" , also familiarly known as Thessalonica, Salonica, or Salonika is the second-largest city in Greece, with over 1 million inhabitants in its metropolitan area, and the capital of Greek Macedonia, the administrative region of Central Macedonia and the Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace. Its nickname is η Συμπρωτεύουσα (\"Symprotévousa\"), literally \"the co-capital\", a reference to its historical status as the Συμβασιλεύουσα (\"Symvasilévousa\") or \"co-reigning\" city of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, alongside Constantinople.\n\nThessaloniki is located on the Thermaic Gulf, at the northwest corner of the Aegean Sea. It is bounded on the west by the delta of the Axios/Vardar. The municipality of Thessaloniki, the historical center, had a population of 325,182 in 2011, while the Thessaloniki Urban Area had a population of 788,952 and the Thessaloniki Metropolitan Area had 1,012,297 inhabitants in 2011. It is Greece's second major economic, industrial, commercial and political centre; it is a major transportation hub for Greece and southeastern Europe, notably through the Port of Thessaloniki. The city is renowned for its festivals, events and vibrant cultural life in general, and is considered to be Greece's cultural capital. Events such as the Thessaloniki International Fair and the Thessaloniki International Film Festival are held annually, while the city also hosts the largest bi-annual meeting of the Greek diaspora. Thessaloniki was the 2014 European Youth Capital.\n\nThe city of Thessaloniki was founded in 315 BC by Cassander of Macedon. An important metropolis by the Roman period, Thessaloniki was the second largest and wealthiest city of the Byzantine Empire. It was conquered by the Ottomans in 1430, and passed from the Ottoman Empire to Greece on 8 November 1912. It is home to numerous notable Byzantine monuments, including the Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as several Roman, Ottoman and Sephardic Jewish structures. The city's main university, Aristotle University, is the largest in Greece and the Balkans.\n\nThessaloniki is a popular tourist destination in Greece. In 2013, \"National Geographic Magazine\" included Thessaloniki in its top tourist destinations worldwide, while in 2014 \"Financial Times\" FDI magazine (Foreign Direct Investments) declared Thessaloniki as the best mid-sized European city of the future for human capital and lifestyle.<ref name=\"European Cities and Regions of the Future 2014/15\"></ref> Among street photographers, the center of Thessaloniki is also considered the most popular destination for street photography in Greece.\n\nThe original name of the city was Θεσσαλονίκη \"Thessaloníkē\". It was named after princess Thessalonike of Macedon, the half sister of Alexander the Great, whose name means \"Thessalian victory\", from 'Thessalos', and 'victory' (Nike), honoring the Macedonian victory at the Battle of Crocus Field (353/352 BCE).\n\nMinor variants are also found, including Θετταλονίκη \"Thettaloníkē, Θεσσαλονίκεια \"Thessaloníkeia\", Θεσσαλονείκη \"Thessaloneíkē\", and Θεσσαλονικέων \"Thessalonikéōn\".\n\nThe name Σαλονίκη \"Saloníki\" is first attested in Greek in the Chronicle of the Morea (14th century), and is common in folk songs, but it must have originated earlier, as al-Idrisi called it \"Salunik\" already in the 12th century. It is the basis for the city's name in other languages: Солѹнь (\"Solun\") in Old Church Slavonic, סלוניקה (\"Salonika\") in Ladino, \"Selânik\" سلانیك in Ottoman Turkish and \"Selanik\" in modern Turkish, \"Salonicco\" in Italian, \"Solun\" or Солун in the local and neighboring South Slavic languages, Салоники (\"Saloníki\") in Russian, and \"Sãrunã\" in Aromanian, and Salonica or Salonika in English.\n\nThessaloniki was revived as the city's official name in 1912, when it joined the Kingdom of Greece during the Balkan Wars. In local speech, the city's name is typically pronounced with a dark and deep \"L\" characteristic of Modern Macedonian accent. The name is often abbreviated as Θεσ/νίκη.\n\nThe city was founded around 315 BC by the King Cassander of Macedon, on or near the site of the ancient town of Therma and 26 other local villages. He named it after his wife Thessalonike, a half-sister of Alexander the Great and princess of Macedonia as daughter of Philip II. Under the kingdom of Macedonia the city retained its own autonomy and parliament and evolved to become the most important city in Macedonia.\n\nAfter the fall of the Kingdom of Macedonia in 168 BC, in 148 BC Thessalonica was made the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia. Thessalonica became a free city of the Roman Republic under Mark Antony in 41 BC. It grew to be an important trade-hub located on the \"Via Egnatia\", the road connecting Dyrrhachium with Byzantium, which facilitated trade between Thessaloniki and great centers of commerce such as Rome and Byzantium. Thessaloniki also lay at the southern end of the main north-south route through the Balkans along the valleys of the Morava and Axios river valleys, thereby linking the Balkans with the rest of Greece. The city later became the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia. Later it became the capital of all the Greek provinces of the Roman Empire because of the city's importance in the Balkan peninsula.\n\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about 50 A.D., Thessaloniki was also one of the early centers of Christianity; while on his second missionary journey, Paul the Apostle visited this city's chief synagogue on three Sabbaths and sowed the seeds for Thessaloniki's first Christian church. Later, Paul wrote two letters to the new church at Thessaloniki, preserved in the Biblical canon as First and Second Thessalonians. Some scholars hold that the First Epistle to the Thessalonians is the first written book of the New Testament.\n\nIn 306 AD, Thessaloniki acquired a patron saint, St. Demetrius, a Christian whom Galerius is said to have put to death. Most scholars agree with Hippolyte Delehaye's theory that Demetrius was not a Thessaloniki native, but his veneration was transferred to Thessaloniki when it replaced Sirmium as the main military base in the Balkans. A basilical church dedicated to St. Demetrius, Hagios Demetrios, was first built in the 5th century AD and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided into the tetrarchy, Thessaloniki became the administrative capital of one of the four portions of the Empire under Galerius Maximianus Caesar, where Galerius commissioned an imperial palace, a new hippodrome, a triumphal arch and a mausoleum among others.\n\nIn 379, when the Roman Prefecture of Illyricum was divided between the East and West Roman Empires, Thessaloniki became the capital of the new Prefecture of Illyricum. In 390, Gothic troops under the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, led a massacre against the inhabitants of Thessalonica, who had risen in revolt against the Gothic soldiers. Also in the same year, the Edict of Thessalonica made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire. By the time of the Fall of Rome in 476, Thessaloniki was the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nFrom the first years of the Byzantine Empire, Thessaloniki was considered the second city in the Empire after Constantinople, both in terms of wealth and size. with a population of 150,000 in the mid-12th century. The city held this status until its transfer to Venetian control in 1423. In the 14th century, the city's population exceeded 100,000 to 150,000, making it larger than London at the time.\n\nDuring the 6th and 7th centuries, the area around Thessaloniki was invaded by Avars and Slavs, who unsuccessfully laid siege to the city several times, as narrated in the \"Miracles of Saint Demetrius\". Traditional historiography stipulates that many Slavs settled in the hinterland of Thessaloniki; however, modern scholars consider this migration to have been on a much smaller scale than previously thought. In the 9th century, the Byzantine Greek missionaries Cyril and Methodius, both natives of the city, created the first literary language of the Slavs, the Old Church Slavonic, most likely based on the Slavic dialect used in the hinterland of their hometown.\n\nAn Arab naval attack in 904 resulted in the sack of the city.\nThe economic expansion of the city continued through the 12th century as the rule of the Komnenoi emperors expanded Byzantine control to the north. Thessaloniki passed out of Byzantine hands in 1204, when Constantinople was captured by the forces of the Fourth Crusade and incorporated the city and its surrounding territories in the Kingdom of Thessalonica — which then became the largest vassal of the Latin Empire. In 1224, the Kingdom of Thessalonica was overrun by the Despotate of Epirus, a remnant of the former Byzantine Empire, under Theodore Komnenos Doukas who crowned himself Emperor, and the city became the capital of the short-lived Empire of Thessalonica. Following his defeat at Klokotnitsa however in 1230, the Empire of Thessalonica became a vassal state of the Second Bulgarian Empire until it was recovered again in 1246, this time by the Nicaean Empire.\n\nIn 1342, the city saw the rise of the Commune of the Zealots, an anti-aristocratic party formed of sailors and the poor, which is nowadays described as social-revolutionary. The city was practically independent of the rest of the Empire, as it had its own government, a form of republic. The zealot movement was overthrown in 1350 and the city was reunited with the rest of the Empire.\n\nThe capture of Gallipoli by the Ottomans in 1354 kicked off a rapid Turkish expansion in the southern Balkans, conducted both by the Ottomans themselves and by semi-independent Turkish ghazi warrior-bands. By 1369, the Ottomans were able to conquer Adrianople (modern Edirne), which became their new capital until 1453. Thessalonica, ruled by Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391–1425) itself surrendered after a lengthy siege in 1383–1387, along with most of eastern and central Macedonia, to the forces of Sultan Murad I. Initially, the surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of the \"kharaj\" poll-tax. Following the death of Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan Bayezid I, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed. Thessalonica too submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after brief resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions.\n\nThessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son Süleyman in the Ottoman succession struggle that broke out following the crushing defeat and capture of Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara against Tamerlane in 1402. In exchange for his support, in the Treaty of Gallipoli the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the Chalcidice peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers Strymon and Pineios. Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415. Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity after 1403, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa Çelebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa Çelebi against Mehmed I). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase again. Just as during the 1383–1387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western help, or submission to the Ottomans.\n\nIn 1423, Despot Andronikos Palaiologos ceded it to the Republic of Venice with the hope that it could be protected from the Ottomans who were besieging the city. The Venetians held Thessaloniki until it was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Murad II on 29 March 1430.\n\nWhen Sultan Murad II captured Thessaloniki and sacked it in 1430, contemporary reports estimated that about one-fifth of the city's population was enslaved. Ottoman artillery was used to secure the city's capture and bypass its double walls. Upon the conquest of Thessaloniki, some of its inhabitants escaped, including intellectuals such as Theodorus Gaza \"Thessalonicensis\" and Andronicus Callistus. However, the change of sovereignty from the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman one did not affect the city's prestige as a major imperial city and trading hub. Thessaloniki and Smyrna, although smaller in size than Constantinople, were the Ottoman Empire's most important trading hubs. Thessaloniki's importance was mostly in the field of shipping, but also in manufacturing, while most of the city's trade was controlled by ethnic Greeks.\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, the city's population of Ottoman Muslims (including those of Turkish and Albanian origin, as well as Bulgarian Muslim and Greek Muslim convert origin) grew substantially. According to the 1478 census Selânik (), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniots community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the city's population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regime's invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city.\n\nThessaloniki was the capital of the Sanjak of Selanik within the wider Rumeli Eyalet (Balkans) until 1826, and subsequently the capital of Selanik Eyalet (after 1867, the Selanik Vilayet). This consisted of the sanjaks of Selanik, Serres and Drama between 1826 and 1912.\n\nWith the break out of the Greek War of Independence in the spring of 1821, the governor Yusuf Bey imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the insurrection to the villages of Chalkidiki, he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The mulla of Thessalonica, Hayrıülah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations: \"Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning. It seems that Yusuf Bey, the Yeniceri Agasi, the Subaşı, the hocas and the ulemas have all gone raving mad.\" It would take until the end of the century for the city's Greek community to recover.\n\nThessaloniki was also a Janissary stronghold where novice Janissaries were trained. In June 1826, regular Ottoman soldiers attacked and destroyed the Janissary base in Thessaloniki while also killing over 10,000 Janissaries, an event known as The Auspicious Incident in Ottoman history. In 1870–1917, driven by economic growth, the city's population expanded by 70%, reaching 135,000 in 1917.\n\nThe last few decades of Ottoman control over the city were an era of revival, particularly in terms of the city's infrastructure. It was at that time that the Ottoman administration of the city acquired an \"official\" face with the creation of the Government House while a number of new public buildings were built in the eclectic style in order to project the European face both of Thessaloniki and the Ottoman Empire. The city walls were torn down between 1869 and 1889, efforts for a planned expansion of the city are evident as early as 1879, the first tram service started in 1888 and the city streets were illuminated with electric lamp posts in 1908. In 1888 the Oriental Railway connected Thessaloniki to Central Europe via rail through Belgrade and to Monastir in 1893, while the Thessaloniki-Istanbul Junction Railway connected it to Constantinople in 1896.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Thessaloniki was in the center of radical activities by various groups; the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, founded in 1897, and the Greek Macedonian Committee, founded in 1903. In 1903 an anarchist group known as the Boatmen of Thessaloniki planted bombs in several buildings in Thessaloniki, including the Ottoman Bank, with some assistance from the IMRO. The Greek consulate in Ottoman Thessaloniki (now the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle) served as the center of operations for the Greek guerillas.\n\nDuring this period, and since the 14th century, Thessaloniki's Jewish element was the most dominant; it was the only city in Europe where the Jews were a majority of the total population. The city was ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan. In 1890 its population had risen to 118,000, 47% of which were Jews, followed by Turks (22%), Greeks (14%), Bulgars (8%), Roma (2%), and others (7%). By 1913, the ethnic composition of the city had changed so that the population stood at 157,889, with Jews at 39%, followed again by Turks (29%), Greeks (25%), Bulgars (4%), Roma (2%), and others at 1%. Many varied religions were practiced and many languages spoken, including Ladino, a dialect of Spanish spoken by the city's Jews.\n\nThessaloniki was also the center of activities of the Young Turks, a political reform movement, which goal was to replace the Ottoman Empire's absolute monarchy with a constitutional government. The Young Turks started out as an underground movement, until finally in 1908, they started the Young Turk Revolution from the city of Thessaloniki, by which their revolutionaries gained control over the Ottoman Empire. Eleftherias (Liberty) Square, where the Young Turks gathered at the outbreak of the revolution, is named after the event.\n\nAs the First Balkan War broke out, Greece declared war on the Ottoman Empire and expanded its borders. When Eleftherios Venizelos, Prime Minister at the time, was asked if the Greek army should move towards Thessaloniki or Monastir (now Bitola, Republic of Macedonia), Venizelos replied \"Θεσσαλονίκη με κάθε κόστος!\" (\"Thessaloniki, at all costs!\"). As both Greece and Bulgaria wanted Thessaloniki, the Ottoman garrison of the city entered negotiations with both armies. On 8 November 1912 (26 October Old Style), the feast day of the city's patron saint, Saint Demetrius, the Greek Army accepted the surrender of the Ottoman garrison at Thessaloniki. The Bulgarian army arrived one day after the surrender of the city to Greece and Tahsin Pasha, ruler of the city, told the Bulgarian officials that \"I have only one Thessaloniki, which I have surrendered\". After the Second Balkan War, Thessaloniki and the rest of the Greek portion of Macedonia were officially annexed to Greece by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1913. On 18 March 1913 George I of Greece was assassinated in the city by Alexandros Schinas.\n\nIn 1915, during World War I, a large Allied expeditionary force established a base at Thessaloniki for operations against pro-German Bulgaria. This culminated in the establishment of the Macedonian Front, also known as the Salonika Front. In 1916, pro-Venizelist Greek army officers and civilians, with the support of the Allies, launched an uprising, creating a pro-Allied temporary government by the name of the \"Provisional Government of National Defence\" that controlled the \"New Lands\" (lands that were gained by Greece in the Balkan Wars, most of Northern Greece including Greek Macedonia, the North Aegean as well as the island of Crete); the official government of the King in Athens, the \"State of Athens\", controlled \"Old Greece\" which were traditionally monarchist. The State of Thessaloniki was disestablished with the unification of the two opposing Greek governments under Venizelos, following the abdication of King Constantine in 1917.\n\nOn 30 December 1915 an Austrian air raid on Thessaloniki alarmed many town civilians and killed at least one person, and in response the Allied troops based there arrested the German and Austrian and Bulgarian and Turkish vice-consuls and their families and dependents and put them on a battleship, and billeted troops in their consulate buildings in Thessaloniki.\n\nMost of the old center of the city was destroyed by the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, which was started accidentally by an unattended kitchen fire on 18 August 1917. The fire swept through the centre of the city, leaving 72,000 people homeless; according to the Pallis Report, most of them were Jewish (50,000). Many businesses were destroyed, as a result, 70% of the population were unemployed. Two churches and many synagogues and mosques were lost. Nearly one-quarter of the total population of approximately 271,157 became homeless. Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan prepared by a group of architects, including the Briton Thomas Mawson, and headed by French architect Ernest Hébrard. Property values fell from 6.5 million Greek drachmas to 750,000.\n\nAfter the defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War and during the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, a population exchange took place between Greece and Turkey. Over 160,000 ethnic Greeks deported from the former Ottoman Empire – particularly Greeks from western Asia Minor and Pontic Greeks as well as Caucasus Greeks from various parts of Eastern Anatolia and the South Caucasus – were resettled in the city, changing its demographics. Additionally many of the city's Muslims, including Ottoman Greek Muslims, were deported to Turkey, ranging at about 20,000 people. This made the Greek element dominant, while the Jewish population was reduced to a minority for the first time since the 14th century.\n\nDuring World War II Thessaloniki was heavily bombarded by Fascist Italy (with 232 people dead, 871 wounded and over 800 buildings damaged or destroyed in November 1940 alone), and, the Italians having failed in their invasion of Greece, it fell to the forces of Nazi Germany on 8 April 1941 and went under German occupation. The Nazis soon forced the Jewish residents into a ghetto near the railroads and on 15 March 1943 began the deportation of the city's Jews to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. Most were immediately sent to the gas chambers. Of the 45,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz, only 4% survived.\nThe importance of Thessaloniki to Nazi Germany can be demonstrated by the fact that, initially, Hitler had planned to incorporate it directly in the Third Reich (that is, make it part of Germany) and not have it controlled by a puppet state such as the Hellenic State or an ally of Germany (Thessaloniki had been promised to Yugoslavia as a reward for joining the Axis on 25 March 1941). As it was the first major city in Greece to fall to the occupying forces, the first Greek resistance group formed in Thessaloniki (under the name Ελευθερία, \"Eleutheria\", \"Freedom\") as well as the first anti-Nazi newspaper in an occupied territory anywhere in Europe, also by the name \"Eleutheria\". Thessaloniki was also home to a military camp-converted-concentration camp, known in German as \"Konzentrationslager Pavlo Mela\" (Pavlos Melas Concentration Camp), where members of the resistance and other anti-fascists were held either to be killed or sent to other concentration camps. On 30 October 1944, Thessaloniki was liberated by forces of the Greek People's Liberation Army, headed by Markos Vafiadis. In the 1946 monarchy referendum, the majority of the locals voted in favour of a republic, contrary to the rest of Greece.\n\nAfter the war, Thessaloniki was rebuilt with large-scale development of new infrastructure and industry throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its architectural treasures still remain, adding value to the city as a tourist destination, while several early Christian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1988. In 1997, Thessaloniki was celebrated as the European Capital of Culture, sponsoring events across the city and the region. Agency established to oversee the cultural activities of that year 1997 was still in existence by 2010. In 2004 the city hosted a number of the football events as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\nToday, Thessaloniki has become one of the most important trade and business hubs in Southeastern Europe, with its port, the Port of Thessaloniki being one of the largest in the Aegean and facilitating trade throughout the Balkan hinterland. On 26 October 2012 the city celebrated its centennial since its incorporation into Greece. The city also forms one of the largest student centres in Southeastern Europe, is host to the largest student population in Greece and was the European Youth Capital in 2014.\n\nThessaloniki lies on the northern fringe of the Thermaic Gulf on its eastern coast and is bound by Mount Chortiatis on its southeast. Its proximity to imposing mountain ranges, hills and fault lines, especially towards its southeast have historically made the city prone to geological changes.\n\nSince medieval times, Thessaloniki was hit by strong earthquakes, notably in 1759, 1902, 1978 and 1995. On 19–20 June 1978, the city suffered a series of powerful earthquakes, registering 5.5 and 6.5 on the Richter scale. The tremors caused considerable damage to a number of buildings and ancient monuments, but the city withstood the catastrophe without any major problems. One apartment building in central Thessaloniki collapsed during the second earthquake, killing many, raising the final death toll to 51.\n\nThessaloniki's climate is directly affected by the sea it is situated on. The city lies in a transitional climatic zone, so its climate displays characteristics of several climates. According to the Köppen climate classification, it has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") that borders on a Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\"), as well as a semi-arid climate (\"BSk\"), observed on the periphery of the region. Its average annual precipitation of is due to the Pindus rain shadow drying the westerly winds. However, the city has a summer precipitation between , which prevents it from qualifying as a Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\"), and increases gradually towards the north and west, turning humid subtropical.\n\nWinters are relatively dry, with common morning frost. Snowfalls οccur sporadically more or less every winter, but the snow cover does not last for more than a few days. Fog is common, with an average of 193 foggy days in a year. During the coldest winters, temperatures can drop to . The record minimum temperature in Thessaloniki was . On average, Thessaloniki experiences frost (sub-zero temperature) 32 days a year. The coldest month of the year in the city is January, with an average 24-hour temperature of . Wind is also usual in the winter months, with December and January having an average wind speed of .\n\nThessaloniki's summers are hot with rather humid nights. Maximum temperatures usually rise above , but rarely go over ; the average number of days the temperature is above is 32. The maximum recorded temperature in the city was . Rain seldom falls in summer, mainly during thunderstorms. In the summer months Thessaloniki also experiences strong heat waves. The hottest month of the year in the city is July, with an average 24-hour temperature of . The average wind speed for June and July in Thessaloniki is .\n\nAccording to the Kallikratis reform, as of 1 January 2011 the Thessaloniki Urban Area () which makes up the \"City of Thessaloniki\", is made up of six self-governing municipalities () and one municipal unit (). The municipalities that are included in the Thessaloniki Urban Area are those of Thessaloniki (the city center and largest in population size), Kalamaria, Neapoli-Sykies, Pavlos Melas, Kordelio-Evosmos, Ampelokipoi-Menemeni, and the municipal unit of Pylaia, part of the municipality of Pylaia-Chortiatis. Prior to the Kallikratis reform, the Thessaloniki Urban Area was made up of twice as many municipalities, considerably smaller in size, which created bureaucratic problems.\n\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki () is the second most populous in Greece, after Athens, with a resident population of 325,182 (in 2011) and an area of , includes the municipal unit of Triandria. The municipality forms the core of the Thessaloniki Urban Area, with its central district (the city center), referred to as the \"Kentro\", meaning 'center' or 'downtown'.\n\nThe institution of mayor of Thessaloniki was inaugurated under the Ottoman Empire, in 1912. The first mayor of Thessaloniki was Osman Sait Bey, while the current mayor of the municipality of Thessaloniki is Yiannis Boutaris. In 2011, the municipality of Thessaloniki had a budget of €464.33 million while the budget of 2012 stands at €409.00 million.\n\nAccording to an article in The New York Times, the way in which the present mayor of Thessaloniki is treating the city's debt and oversized administration problems could be used as an example by Greece's central government for a successful strategy in dealing with these problems.\n\nThessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece. It is an influential city for the northern parts of the country and is the capital of the region of Central Macedonia and the Thessaloniki regional unit. The Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace is also based in Thessaloniki, being that the city is the de facto capital of the Greek region of Macedonia.\n\nIt is customary every year for the Prime Minister of Greece to announce his administration's policies on a number of issues, such as the economy, at the opening night of the Thessaloniki International Fair. In 2010, during the first months of the 2010 Greek debt crisis, the entire cabinet of Greece met in Thessaloniki to discuss the country's future.\n\nIn the Hellenic Parliament, the Thessaloniki urban area constitutes a 16-seat constituency. As of the national elections of 20 September 2015 the largest party in Thessaloniki is the Coalition of the Radical Left with 35.8% of the vote, followed by New Democracy (25.3%) and Golden Dawn (7.3%). The table below summarizes the results of the latest elections.\n\nArchitecture in Thessaloniki is the direct result of the city's position at the centre of all historical developments in the Balkans. Aside from its commercial importance, Thessaloniki was also for many centuries the military and administrative hub of the region, and beyond this the transportation link between Europe and the Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine).\nMerchants, traders and refugees from all over Europe settled in the city. The need for commercial and public buildings in this new era of prosperity led to the construction of large edifices in the city center. During this time, the city saw the building of banks, large hotels, theatres, warehouses, and factories. Architects who designed some of the most notable buildings of the city, in the late 19th and early 20th century, include Vitaliano Poselli, Pietro Arrigoni, Xenophon Paionidis, Salvatore Poselli, Leonardo Gennari, Eli Modiano, Moshé Jacques, Jean Joseph Pleyber, Frederic Charnot, Ernst Ziller, Roubens Max, Levi Ernst, Angelos Siagas, Alexandros Tzonis and others, using mainly the styles of Eclecticism, Art Nouveau and Neobaroque.\n\nThe city layout changed after 1870, when the seaside fortifications gave way to extensive piers, and many of the oldest walls of the city were demolished, including those surrounding the White Tower, which today stands as the main landmark of the city. As parts of the early Byzantine walls were demolished, this allowed the city to expand east and west along the coast.\n\nThe expansion of Eleftherias Square towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city. As the city grew, workers moved to the western districts, because of their proximity to factories and industrial activities; while the middle and upper classes gradually moved from the city-center to the eastern suburbs, leaving mainly businesses. In 1917, a devastating fire swept through the city and burned uncontrollably for 32 hours. It destroyed the city's historic center and a large part of its architectural heritage, but paved the way for modern development and allowed Thessaloniki the development of a proper European city center, featuring wider diagonal avenues and monumental squares; which the city initially lacked – much of what was considered to be 'essential' in European architecture.\n\nAfter the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, a team of architects and urban planners including Thomas Mawson and Ernest Hebrard, a French architect, chose the Byzantine era as the basis of their (re)building designs for Thessaloniki's city centre. The new city plan included axes, diagonal streets and monumental squares, with a street grid that would channel traffic smoothly. The plan of 1917 included provisions for future population expansions and a street and road network that would be, and still is sufficient today. It contained sites for public buildings and provided for the restoration of Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques.\n\nToday, the city center of Thessaloniki includes the features designed as part of the plan and forms the point in the city where most of the public buildings, historical sites, entertainment venues and stores are located. The center is characterized by its many historical buildings, arcades, laneways and distinct architectural styles such as Art Nouveau and Art Deco, which can be seen on many of its buildings.\n\nAlso called the \"historic centre\", it is divided into several districts, including \"Ladadika\" (where many entertainment venues and tavernas are located), \"Kapani\" (were the city's central Modiano market is located), \"Diagonios, Navarinou, Rotonda, Agia Sofia\" and \"Hippodromio\", which are all located around Thessaloniki's most central point, Aristotelous Square. Various commercial stoas around Aristotelous are named from the city's past and historic personalities of the city, like \"stoa Hirsch\", stoa \"Carasso/Ermou\", \"Pelosov\", \"Colombo\", \"Saul (Modiano)\", \"Morpurgo\", \"Mordoch\", \"Simcha\", \"Malakopi\", \"Olympios\", \"Emboron\", \"Rogoti\", \"Vyzantio\", \"Tatti\", \"Karipi\" etc.\n\nThe western portion of the city centre is home to Thessaloniki's law courts, its central international railway station and the port, while its eastern side hosts the city's two universities, the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Centre, the city's main stadium, its archaeological and Byzantine museums, the new city hall and its central parks and gardens, namely those of the \"ΧΑΝΘ/Palios Zoologikos Kipos\" and \"Pedion tou Areos\".\nThe central road arteries that pass through the city centre, designed in the Ernest Hebrard plan, include those of Tsimiski, Egnatia, Nikis, Mitropoleos, Venizelou and St Demetrius avenues.\n\nAno Poli (also called \"Old Town\" and literally the \"Upper Town\") is the heritage listed district north of Thessaloniki's city center that was not engulfed by the great fire of 1917 and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site by ministerial actions of Melina Merkouri, during the 1980s. It consists of Thessaloniki's most traditional part of the city, still featuring small stone paved streets, old squares and homes featuring old Greek and Ottoman architecture.\n\nAno Poli also, is the highest point in Thessaloniki and as such, is the location of the city's \"acropolis\", its Byzantine fort, the Heptapyrgion, a large portion of the city's remaining walls, and with many of its additional Ottoman and Byzantine structures still standing. The area provides access to the \"Seich Sou\" Forest National Park and features panoramic views of the whole city and the Thermaic Gulf. On clear days Mount Olympus, at about away across the gulf, can also be seen towering the horizon.\n\nSoutheastern Thessaloniki up until the 1920s was home to the city's most affluent residents and formed the outermost suburbs of the city at the time, with the area close to the Thermaic Gulf coast called \"Exoches\" (des Campagnes), from the 19th century holiday villas which defined the area. Today southeastern Thessaloniki has in some way become a natural extension of the city center, with the avenues of Megalou Alexandrou, Georgiou Papandreou (Antheon), Vasilissis Olgas, Delfon, Konstantinou Karamanli (Nea Egnatia) and Papanastasiou passing through it, enclosing an area traditionally called \"Dépôt\" (\"Ντεπώ\"), from the name of the old tram station, owned by a French company. The area extends to Kalamaria and Pylaia, about from the White Tower in the city center.\n\nSome of the most notable mansions and villas of the old-era of the city remain along Vasilissis Olgas Avenue. Built for the most wealthy residents and designed by well known architects they are used today as museums, art galleries or remain as private properties. Some of them include \"Villa Allatini\", \"Villa Bianca\", \"Villa Mehmet Kapanci\", \"Villa Modiano\", \"Villa Mordoch\", \"Villa Ahmet Kapanci\", \"Hatzilazarou/Siaga Mansion\", \"Villa Morpurgo/Zardinidi\", \"Villa Jeborga/Salem\" (the old Italian consulate), \"Villa Nechama\", \"Château Mon Bonheur\" (often called \"Red Tower\") and others.\n\nMost of southeastern Thessaloniki is characterized by its modern architecture and apartment buildings, home to the middle-class and more than half of the municipality of Thessaloniki population. Today this area of the city is also home to 3 of the city's main football stadiums, the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, the \"Poseidonio\" aquatic and athletic complex, the Naval Command post of Northern Greece and the old royal palace (called Palataki), located on the most westerly point of Karabournaki cape. The municipality of Kalamaria is also located in southeastern Thessaloniki and was firstly inhabited mainly by Pontic Greek refugees after 1922.\n\nNorthwestern Thessaloniki had always been associated with industry and the working class because as the city grew during the 1920s, many workers had moved there, because of its proximity near factories and industrial activities.\nToday many factories and industries have been moved further out west and the area is experiencing rapid growth as does the southeast. Many factories in this area have been converted to cultural centres, while past military grounds that are being surrounded by densely built neighborhoods are awaiting transformation into parklands.\n\nNorthwest Thessaloniki forms the main entry point into the city of Thessaloniki with the avenues of Monastiriou, Lagkada and 26is Octovriou passing through it, as well as the extension of the A1 motorway, feeding into Thessaloniki's city center. The area is home to the Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal (KTEL), the Zeitenlik Allied memorial military cemetery and to large entertainment venues of the city, such as \"Milos\", \"Fix\", \"Vilka\" (which are housed in converted old factories). Northwestern Thessaloniki is also home to \"Moni Lazariston\", located in Stavroupoli, which today forms one of the most important cultural centers for the city.\n\nBecause of Thessaloniki's importance during the early Christian and Byzantine periods, the city is host to several paleochristian monuments that have significantly contributed to the development of Byzantine art and architecture throughout the Byzantine Empire as well as Serbia. The evolution of Imperial Byzantine architecture and the prosperity of Thessaloniki go hand in hand, especially during the first years of the Empire, when the city continued to flourish. It was at that time that the Complex of Roman emperor Galerius was built, as well as the first church of Hagios Demetrios.\n\nBy the 8th century, the city had become an important administrative center of the Byzantine Empire, and handled much of the Empire's Balkan affairs. During that time, the city saw the creation of more notable Christian churches that are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as Hagia Sophia of Thessaloniki, the Church of the Acheiropoietos, the Church of Panagia Chalkeon. When the Ottoman Empire took control of Thessaloniki in 1430, most of the city's churches were converted into mosques, but have survived to this day. Travelers such as Paul Lucas and Abdulmejid I document the city's wealth in Christian monuments during the years of the Ottoman control of the city.\n\nThe church of Hagios Demetrios was burnt down during the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, as did many other of the city's monuments, but it was rebuilt. During World War II, the city was extensively bombed and as such many of Thessaloniki's paleochristian and Byzantine monuments were heavily damaged. Some of the sites were not restored until the 1980s. Thessaloniki has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites listed than any other city in Greece, a total of 15 monuments. They have been listed since 1988.\n\nWith the 100th anniversary of the 1912 incorporation of Thessaloniki into Greece, the government announced a large-scale redevelopment program for the city of Thessaloniki, which aims in addressing the current environmental and spatial problems that the city faces. More specifically, the program will drastically change the physiognomy of the city by relocating the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center and grounds of the Thessaloniki International Fair outside the city centre and turning the current location into a large metropolitan park, redeveloping the coastal front of the city, relocating the city's numerous military camps and using the grounds and facilities to create large parklands and cultural centers; and the complete redevelopment of the harbor and the \"Lachanokipoi\" and \"Dendropotamos\" districts (behind and near the Port of Thessaloniki) into a commercial business district, with possible highrise developments.\n\nThe plan also envisions the creation of new wide avenues in the outskirts of the city and the creation of pedestrian-only zones in the city centre. Furthermore, the program includes plans to expand the jurisdiction of \"Seich Sou\" Forest National Park and the improvement of accessibility to and from the Old Town. The ministry has said that the project will take an estimated 15 years to be completed, in 2025.\n\nPart of the plan has been implemented with extensive pedestrianization's within the city center by the municipality of Thessaloniki and the revitalization the eastern urban waterfront/promenade, \"Nea Paralia\" (, literally \"new beach\"), with a modern and vibrant design. Its first section opened in 2008, having been awarded as the best public project in Greece of the last five years by the Hellenic Institute of Architecture.\n\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki's budget for the reconstruction of important areas of the city and the completion of the waterfront, opened in January 2014, was estimated at around million ( million) for the year 2011 alone.\n\nThessaloniki rose to economic prominence as a major economic hub in the Balkans during the years of the Roman Empire. The Pax Romana and the city's strategic position allowed for the facilitation of trade between Rome and Byzantium (later Constantinople and now Istanbul) through Thessaloniki by means of the Via Egnatia. The Via Egnatia also functioned as an important line of communication between the Roman Empire and the nations of Asia, particularly in relation to the Silk Road. With the partition of the Roman Emp. into East (Byzantine) and West, Thessaloniki became the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire after New Rome (Constantinople) in terms of economic might. Under the Empire, Thessaloniki was the largest port in the Balkans. As the city passed from Byzantium to the Republic of Venice in 1423, it was subsequently conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Under Ottoman rule the city retained its position as the most important trading hub in the Balkans. Manufacturing, shipping and trade were the most important components of the city's economy during the Ottoman period, and the majority of the city's trade at the time was controlled by ethnic Greeks. Plus, the Jewish community was also an important factor in the trade sector.\n\nHistorically important industries for the economy of Thessaloniki included tobacco (in 1946 35% of all tobacco companies in Greece were headquartered in the city, and 44% in 1979) and banking (in Ottoman years Thessaloniki was a major center for investment from western Europe, with the Bank of Thessaloniki () having a capital of 20 million French francs in 1909).\n\nThe service sector accounts for nearly two thirds of the total labour force of Thessaloniki. Of those working in services, 20% were employed in trade, 13% in education and healthcare, 7.1% in real estate, 6.3% in transport, communications & storing, 6.1% in the finance industry & service-providing organizations, 5.7% in public administration & insurance services and 5.4% in hotels & restaurants.\n\nThe city's port, the Port of Thessaloniki, is one of the largest ports in the Aegean and as a free port, it functions as a major gateway to the Balkan hinterland. In 2010, more than 15.8 million tons of products went through the city's port, making it the second-largest port in Greece after Aghioi Theodoroi, surpassing Piraeus. At 273,282 TEUs, it is also Greece's second-largest container port after Piraeus. As a result, the city is a major transportation hub for the whole of south-eastern Europe, carrying, among other things, trade to and from the neighbouring countries.\n\nIn recent years Thessaloniki has begun to turn into a major port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean. The Greek ministry of tourism considers Thessaloniki to be Greece's second most important commercial port, and companies such as Royal Caribbean International have expressed interest in adding the Port of Thessaloniki to their destinations. A total of 30 cruise ships are expected to arrive at Thessaloniki in 2011.\n\nAfter the WWII, heavy industrialization of the city's suburbs began in the late 1950s.\n\nIn recent years a spate of factory shut downs has occurred as companies take advantage of cheaper labour markets and more lax regulations in other areas. Among the largest companies to shut down factories are Goodyear, AVEZ (the first industrial factory in northern Greece, built in 1926), Philkeram Johnson and VIAMIL (ΒΙΑΜΥΛ). Nevertheless, Thessaloniki still remains a major business hub in the Balkans, with a number of important Greek companies headquartered in the city, such as the Hellenic Vehicle Industry (ELVO), Namco (automobiles), Astra Airlines, Pyramis and MLS Multimedia, which introduced the first Greek-built smartphone in 2012.\n\nIn the middle 60s, with the collaboration of Standard Oil and ESSO-Pappas, a large industrial zone was created, containing refineries, oil refinery and steel production. The zone attracted also a series of different factories during the next decades. Today the oil refinery is owned by the Hellenic Petroleum.\n\nTitan Cement has also facilities outside the city, road to Serres.\n\nFoodstuff companies headquartered in the city include the Macedonian Milk Industry, Allatini, while the Goody's chain started from the city.\n\nThe American Farm School also has an important contribution in food production.\n\nIn 2011, the regional unit of Thessaloniki had a Gross Domestic Product of €18.293 billion (ranked 2nd amongst the country's regional units), comparable to Bahrain or Cyprus, and a per capita of €15,900 (ranked 16th). In Purchasing Power Parity, the same indicators are €19,851 billion (2nd) and €17,200 (15th) respectively. In terms of comparison with the European Union average, Thessaloniki's GDP per capita indicator stands at 63% the EU average and 69% in PPP – this is comparable to the German state of Brandenburg. Overall, Thessaloniki accounts for 8.9% of the total economy of Greece. Between 1995 and 2008 Thessaloniki's GDP saw an average growth rate of 4.1% per annum (ranging from +14.5% in 1996 to −11.1% in 2005) while in 2011 the economy contracted by −7.8%.\n\nThe tables below show the ethnic statistics of Thessaloniki during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki is the most populous in the Thessaloniki Urban Area. Although its population has declined in the latest census, the metropolitan area's population is still growing. The city forms the base of the Thessaloniki Metropolitan Area, with latest census in 2011 giving it a population of 1,104,460.\n\nThe Jewish population in Greece is the oldest in mainland Europe (see Romaniotes). When Paul the Apostle came in Thessaloniki he taught in the area of what today is called \"Upper City\". Later, during the Ottoman period, with the coming of Sephardic Jews from Spain, the community of Thessaloniki became mostly Sephardic. Thessaloniki became the largest center in Europe of the Sephardic Jews, who nicknamed the city \"la madre de Israel\" (Israel's mother) and \"Jerusalem of the Balkans\". It also included the historically significant and ancient Greek-speaking Romaniote community. During the Ottoman era, Thessaloniki's Sephardic community of was half the population according to the Ottoman Census of 1902 and almost 40% the city's population of 157,000 about 1913; Jewish merchants were prominent in commerce until the ethnic Greek population increased after independence in 1912. By the 1680s, about 300 families of Sephardic Jews, followers of Sabbatai Zevi, had converted to Islam, becoming a sect known as the \"Dönmeh\" (convert), and migrated to Salonika, whose population was majority Jewish. They established an active community that thrived for about 250 years. Many of their descendants later became prominent in trade. Many Jewish inhabitants of Thessaloniki spoke Ladino, the Romance language of the Sephardic Jews.\n\nFrom the second half of the 19th century with the Ottoman reforms, the Jewish community had a new revival. Many French and especially Italian Jews (from Livorno and other cities), influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environment for the Jewish population, were established in Thessaloniki. Such modernists introduced also new techniques and ideas from the industrialized Western Europe and from the 1880s the city began to industrialize. The Italian Jews Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing milling and other food industries, brickmaking and processing plants for tobacco. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production. Other notable names of the era include the Italian Jewish Modiano family and the Italians Poselli.\n\nAfter the Balkan Wars, Thessaloniki was incorporated into the Greek Kingdom in 1913. At first the community feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties and during the first years its political stance was, in general, anti-Venizelist and pro-royalist/conservative. The Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 during World War I burned much of the center of the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out. Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated: to the United States, Palestine, and Paris. They could not wait for the government to create a new urban plan for rebuilding, which was eventually done.\n\nAfter the Greco-Turkish War in 1922 and the expulsion of Greeks from Turkey, many refugees came to Greece. Nearly 100,000 ethnic Greeks resettled in Thessaloniki, reducing the proportion of Jews in the total community. After this, Jews made up about 20% of the city's population. During the interwar period, Greece granted Jewish citizens the same civil rights as other Greek citizens. In March 1926, Greece re-emphasized that all citizens of Greece enjoyed equal rights, and a considerable proportion of the city's Jews decided to stay. During the Metaxas regime the stance towards Jews became even better.\n\nWorld War II brought a disaster for the Jewish Greeks, since in 1941 the Germans occupied Greece and began actions against the Jewish population. Greeks of the Resistance helped save some of the Jewish residents. By the 1940s, the great majority of the Jewish Greek community firmly identified as both Greek and Jewish. According to Misha Glenny, such Greek Jews had largely not encountered \"anti-Semitism as in its North European form.\"\n\nIn 1943 the Nazis began brutal, inhumane actions against the historic Jewish population in Thessaloniki, forcing them into a ghetto near the railroad lines and beginning deportation to concentration and labor camps where they dehumanized their captives. They deported and exterminated approximately 96% of Thessaloniki's Jews of all ages during the Holocaust. The Thessaloniki Holocaust memorial in Eleftherias (\"Freedom\") Square was built in 1997 in memory of all the Jewish people from Thessaloniki, who died in the Holocaust. The site was chosen because it was the place where Jewish residents were rounded up before embarking to trains for concentration camps. Today, a community of around 1200 remains in the city. Communities of descendants of Thessaloniki Jews – both Sephardic and Romaniote – live in other areas, mainly the United States and Israel. Israeli singer Yehuda Poliker recorded a song about the Jewish people of Thessaloniki, called \"Wait for me, Thessaloniki\". Not only did the Jewish-Greek population of Thessaloniki perish during the Holocaust, but a unique civilization filled with rich culture and beauty was lost.\n\nSince the late 19th century, many merchants from Western Europe (mainly from France and Italy) were established in the city. They had an important role in the social and economical life of the city and in many cases introduced new industrial techniques. Their main district was what is known today as the \"Frankish district\" (near Ladadika), where locates also the Catholic church designed by Vitaliano Poselli. Some of them left after the incorporation of the city into the Greek Kingdom, others, who were of Jewish faith, were exterminated by the Nazis, while others stayed and their descendants still live in the city.\n\nAnother group is the Armenian community which dates back to the Ottoman period. During the 20th century, after the Armenian Genocide and the defeat of the Greek army in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22), many fled to Greece and a large part of them was established in Thessaloniki. There is also an Armenian church at the center of the city.\n\nThessaloniki is not only regarded as the cultural and entertainment capital of northern Greece but also the cultural capital of the country. The city's main theaters, run by the National Theatre of Northern Greece (Greek: Κρατικό Θέατρο Βορείου Ελλάδος) which was established in 1961, include the \"Theater of the Society of Macedonian Studies\", where the National Theater is based, the \"Royal Theater\" (\"Vasiliko Theatro\") -the first base of the National Theater-, \"Moni Lazariston\", and the \"Earth Theater\" and \"Forest Theater\", both amphitheatrical open-air theatres overlooking the city.\nThe title of the European Capital of Culture in 1997 saw the birth of the city's first opera and today forms an independent section of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. The opera is based at the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, one of the largest concert halls in Greece. Recently a second building was also constructed and designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. Thessaloniki is also the seat of two symphony orchestras, the \"Thessaloniki State Symphony Orchestra\" and the \"Symphony Orchestra of the Municipality of Thessaloniki\".\n\"Olympion Theater\", the site of the Thessaloniki International Film Festival and the \"Plateia Assos Odeon multiplex\" are the two major cinemas in downtown Thessaloniki. The city also has a number of multiplex cinemas in major shopping malls in the suburbs, most notably in Mediterranean Cosmos, the largest retail and entertainment development in the Balkans.\n\nThessaloniki is renowned for its major shopping streets and lively laneways. Tsimiski Street and Proxenou Koromila avenue are the city's most famous shopping streets and are among Greece's most expensive and exclusive high streets. The city is also home to one of Greece's most famous and prestigious hotels, Makedonia Palace hotel, the Hyatt Regency Casino and hotel (the biggest casino in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe) and Waterland, the largest water park in southeastern Europe.\n\nThe city has long been known in Greece for its vibrant city culture, including having the most cafes and bars per capita of any city in Europe; and as having some of the best nightlife and entertainment in the country, thanks to its large young population and multicultural feel. Lonely Planet listed Thessaloniki among the world's \"ultimate party cities\".\n\nAlthough Thessaloniki is not renowned for its parks and greenery throughout its urban area, where green spaces are few, it has several large open spaces around its waterfront, namely the central city gardens of \"Palios Zoologikos Kipos\" (which is recently being redeveloped to also include rock climbing facilities, a new skatepark and paintball range), the park of \"Pedion tou Areos\", which also holds the city's annual floral expo; and the parks of the \"Nea Paralia\" (waterfront) that span for along the coast, from the White Tower to the concert hall.\n\nThe \"Nea Paralia\" parks are used throughout the year for a variety of events, while they open up to the Thessaloniki waterfront, which is lined up with several cafés and bars; and during summer is full of Thessalonians enjoying their long evening walks (referred to as \"the volta\" and is embedded into the culture of the city). Having undergone an extensive revitalization, the city's waterfront today features a total of 12 thematic gardens/parks.\n\nThessaloniki's proximity to places such as the national parks of Pieria and beaches of Chalkidiki often allow its residents to easily have access to some of the best outdoor recreation in Europe; however, the city is also right next to the \"Seich Sou\" forest national park, just away from Thessaloniki's city center; and offers residents and visitors alike, quiet viewpoints towards the city, mountain bike trails and landscaped hiking paths. The city's zoo, which is operated by the municipality of Thessaloniki, is also located nearby the national park.\n\nOther recreation spaces throughout the Thessaloniki Metropolitan Area include the \"Fragma Thermis\", a landscaped parkland near Thermi and the Delta wetlands west of the city center; while urban beaches that have continuously been awarded the blue flags, are located along the coastline of Thessaloniki's southeastern suburbs of Thermaikos, about away from the city center.\n\nBecause of the city's rich and diverse history, Thessaloniki houses many museums dealing with many different eras in history. Two of the city's most famous museums include the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of Byzantine Culture.\n\nThe Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki was established in 1962 and houses some of the most important ancient Macedonian artifacts, including an extensive collection of golden artwork from the royal palaces of Aigai and Pella. It also houses exhibits from Macedon's prehistoric past, dating from the Neolithic to the Bronze age. The Prehistoric Antiquities Museum of Thessaloniki has exhibits from those periods as well.\n\nThe Museum of Byzantine Culture is one of the city's most famous museums, showcasing the city's glorious Byzantine past. The museum was also awarded Council of Europe's museum prize in 2005. The museum of the White Tower of Thessaloniki houses a series of galleries relating to the city's past, from the creation of the White Tower until recent years.\n\nOne of the most modern museums in the city is the Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum and is one of the most high-tech museums in Greece and southeastern Europe. It features the largest planetarium in Greece, a cosmotheater with the largest flat screen in Greece, an amphitheater, a motion simulator with 3D projection and 6-axis movement and exhibition spaces. Other industrial and technological museums in the city include the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki, which houses an original Orient Express train, the War Museum of Thessaloniki and others. The city also has a number of educational and sports museums, including the Thessaloniki Olympic Museum.\n\nThe Atatürk Museum in Thessaloniki is the historic house where Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of modern-day Turkey, was born. The house is now part of the Turkish consulate complex, but admission to the museum is free. The museum contains historic information about Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his life, especially while he was in Thessaloniki.\nOther ethnological museums of the sort include the Historical Museum of the Balkan Wars, the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle, containing information about the freedom fighters in Macedonia and their struggle to liberate the region from the Ottoman yoke. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018.\n\nThe city also has a number of important art galleries. Such include the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art, housing exhibitions from a number of well-known Greek and foreign artists. The Teloglion Foundation of Art is part of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and includes an extensive collection of works by important artists of the 19th and 20th centuries, including works by prominent Greeks and native Thessalonians. The Thessaloniki Museum of Photography also houses a number of important exhibitions, and is located within the old port of Thessaloniki.\n\nThessaloniki is home to a number of prominent archaeological sites. Apart from its recognized UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Thessaloniki features a large two-terraced Roman forum featuring two-storey stoas, dug up by accident in the 1960s. The forum complex also boasts two Roman baths, one of which has been excavated while the other is buried underneath the city. The forum also features a small theater, which was also used for gladiatorial games. Although the initial complex was not built in Roman times, it was largely refurbished in the 2nd century. It is believed that the forum and the theater continued to be used until at least the 6th century.\n\nAnother important archaeological site is the imperial palace complex which Roman emperor Galerius, located at Navarinou Square, commissioned when he made Thessaloniki the capital of his portion of the Roman Empire. The large octagonal portion of the complex, most of which survives to this day, is believed to have been an imperial throne room. Various mosaics from the palatial complex have also survived. Some historians believe that the complex must have been in use as an imperial residence until the 11th century.\n\nNot far from the palace itself is the Arch of Galerius, known colloquially as the \"Kamara\". The arch was built to commemorate the emperor's campaigns against the Persians. The original structure featured three arches; however, only two full arches and part of the third survive to this day. Many of the arches' marble parts survive as well, although it is mostly the brick interior that can be seen today.\n\nOther monuments of the city's past, such as the \"Incantadas\", a Caryatid portico from the ancient forum, have been removed or destroyed over the years. The Incantadas in particular are on display at the Louvre. Thanks to a private donation of €180,000, it was announced on 6 December 2011 that a replica of the Incantadas would be commissioned and later put on display in Thessaloniki.\n\nThe construction of the Thessaloniki Metro inadvertently started the largest archaeological dig not only of the city, but of Northern Greece; the dig spans and has unearthed 300,000 individual artefacts from as early as the Roman Empire and as late as the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917. Ancient Thessaloniki's Decumanus Maximus was also found and of the marble-paved and column-lined road were unearthed along with shops, other buildings, and plumbing, prompting one scholar to describe the discovery as \"the Byzantine Pompeii\". Some of the artefacts will be put on display inside the metro stations, while will feature the world's first open archaeological site located within a metro station.\n\nThessaloniki is home of a number of festivals and events. The Thessaloniki International Fair is the most important event to be hosted in the city annually, by means of economic development. It was first established in 1926 and takes place every year at the \"Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center\". The event attracts major political attention and it is customary for the Prime Minister of Greece to outline his administration's policies for the next year, during event. Over 250,000 visitors attended the exposition in 2010. The new Art Thessaloniki, is starting first time 29.10. – 1 November 2015 as an international contemporary art fair. \nThe Thessaloniki International Film Festival is established as one of the most important film festivals in Southern Europe, with a number of notable film makers such as Francis Ford Coppola, Faye Dunaway, Catherine Deneuve, Irene Papas and Fatih Akın taking part, and was established in 1960. The Documentary Festival, founded in 1999, has focused on documentaries that explore global social and cultural developments, with many of the films presented being candidates for FIPRESCI and Audience Awards.\n\nThe Dimitria festival, founded in 1966 and named after the city's patron saint of St. Demetrius, has focused on a wide range of events including music, theatre, dance, local happenings, and exhibitions. The \"DMC DJ Championship\" has been hosted at the International Trade Fair of Thessaloniki, has become a worldwide event for aspiring DJs and turntablists. The \"International Festival of Photography\" has taken place every February to mid-April. Exhibitions for the event are sited in museums, heritage landmarks, galleries, bookshops and cafés. Thessaloniki also holds an annual International Book Fair.\n\nBetween 1962–1997 and 2005–2008 the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival, Greece's most important music festival, at Alexandreio Melathron.\n\nIn 2012 the city hosted its first pride parade, \"Thessaloniki Pride\", which took place between 22 and 23 June. It has been held every year ever since, however in 2013 transgender people participating in the parade became victims of police brutality. The issue was soon settled by the government. The city's Greek Orthodox Church leadership has consistently rallied against the event, but mayor Boutaris sided with \"Thessaloniki Pride\", saying also that Thessaloniki would seek to host EuroPride 2020. The event was given to Thessaloniki in September 2017, beating Bergen, Brussels, and Hamburg.\n\nThe main stadium of the city is the Kaftanzoglio Stadium (also home ground of Iraklis FC), while other main stadiums of the city include the football Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium and Toumba Stadium home grounds of Aris F.C. and PAOK F.C., respectively, all of whom are founding members of the Greek league.\n\nBeing the largest \"multi-sport\" stadium in the city, Kaftanzoglio Stadium regularly plays host to athletics events; such as the European Athletics Association event \"Olympic Meeting Thessaloniki\" every year; it has hosted the Greek national championships in 2009 and has been used for athletics at the Mediterranean Games and for the European Cup in athletics. In 2004 the stadium served as an official Athens 2004 venue, while in 2009 the city and the stadium hosted the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.\n\nThessaloniki's major indoor arenas include the state-owned Alexandreio Melathron, PAOK Sports Arena and the YMCA indoor hall. Other sporting clubs in the city include Apollon FC based in Kalamaria, Agrotikos Asteras F.C. based in Evosmos and YMCA. Thessaloniki has a rich sporting history with its teams winning the first ever panhellenic football, basketball, and water polo tournaments.\n\nThe city played a major role in the development of basketball in Greece. The local YMCA was the first to introduce the sport to the country, while Iraklis BC won the first ever Greek championship. From 1982 to 1993 Aris BC dominated the league, regularly finishing in first place. In that period Aris won a total of 9 championships, 7 cups and one European Cup Winners' Cup. The city also hosted the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in which Greece came third. In volleyball, Iraklis has emerged since 2000 as one of the most successful teams in Greece and Europe – see 2005–06 CEV Champions League. In October 2007, Thessaloniki also played host to the first Southeastern European Games.\n\nThe city is also the finish point of the annual Alexander The Great Marathon, which starts at Pella, in recognition of its Ancient Macedonian heritage.\n\nThessaloniki is home to the ERT3 TV-channel and Radio Macedonia, both services of Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) operating in the city and are broadcast all over Greece.\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki also operates three radio stations, namely FM100, FM101 and FM100.6; and TV100, a television network which was also the first non-state-owned TV station in Greece and opened in 1988. Several private TV-networks also broadcast out from Thessaloniki, with Makedonia TV being the most popular.\n\nThe city's main newspapers and some of the most circulated in Greece, include \"Makedonia\", which was also the first newspaper published in Thessaloniki in 1911 and \"Aggelioforos\". A large number of radio stations also broadcast from Thessaloniki as the city is known for its music contributions.\n\n\n\nThroughout its history, Thessaloniki has been home to a number of well-known figures. It is also the birthplace of various Saints and other religious figures, such as Cyril and Methodius (creators of the first Slavic alphabet), Saint Mitre, Gregory Palamas, Eustathius of Thessalonica, Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople and Archbishop Demetrios of America. Other Byzantine-era notables include Constantine Armenopoulos, Theodorus Gaza and Matthaios Kamariotis.\n\nMany of Greece's modern celebrated musicians and movie personalities were born in Thessaloniki, such as Zoe Laskari, Costas Hajihristos, Giannis Dalianidis, Harry Klynn, Alberto Eskenazy, Antonis Remos, Paschalis Terzis, Nikos Papazoglou, Nikolas Asimos, Giorgos Hatzinasios, Stella Haskil, Natassa Theodoridou, Katia Zygouli, Kostas Voutsas, Takis Kanellopoulos, Titos Vandis, Manolis Chiotis, Dionysis Savvopoulos, Marinella, Yvonne Sanson and the classical composer Emilios Riadis. Additionally, there have been a number of political leaders born in the city: Evangelos Venizelos, Christos Sartzetakis, fourth President of Greece, Kostas Zouraris, Stelios Papathemelis, Giannis Boutaris and Ioannis Passalidis. Sports personalities from the city include Giannis Ioannidis, Faidon Matthaiou, Alketas Panagoulias, Panagiotis Fasoulas, Eleni Daniilidou, Dimitris Salpingidis, Traianos Dellas, Giorgos Koudas, Kleanthis Vikelidis, Christos Kostis and Nikos Zisis. Benefactor Ioannis Papafis, poet Manolis Anagnostakis, such as the anarchist Elias Petropoulos were also born in Thessaloniki.\n\nThe city is also the birthplace of a number of important international personalities, which include Bulgarians (Atanas Dalchev), Jews (Moshe Levy, Daniel Zion, Samuel ben Joseph Uziel, Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz, Salamo Arouch), Slav Macedonians (Dimo Todorovski) and Turks (Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Nâzım Hikmet, Afet İnan, Cahit Arf, Mehmet Cavit Bey, Salih Omurtak, Sabiha Sertel, Halil Rifat Pasha).\n\nBecause Thessaloniki remained under Ottoman rule for about 100 years more than southern Greece, it has retained a lot of its Eastern character, including its culinary tastes. Spices in particular play an important role in the cuisine of Thessaloniki, something which is not true to the same degree about Greece's southern regions. Thessaloniki's Ladadika borough is a particularly busy area in regards to Thessalonian cuisine, with most tavernas serving traditional meze and other such culinary delights.\n\nBougatsa, a breakfast pastry, which can be either sweet or savory, is very popular throughout the city and has spread around other parts of Greece and the Balkans as well. Another popular snack is \"koulouri\".\n\nNotable sweets of the city are \"Trigona\", \"Roxakia\" and \"Armenovil\". A stereotypical Thessalonian coffee drink is Frappé coffee. Frappé was invented in the Thessaloniki International Fair in 1957 and has since spread throughout Greece and Cyprus to become a hallmark of the Greek coffee culture.\n\nThe city is viewed as a romantic one in Greece, and as such Thessaloniki is commonly featured in Greek songs. There are a number of famous songs that go by the name 'Thessaloniki' (rebetiko, laïko etc.) or include the name in their title.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 40s the city became a center of the Rebetiko music, partly because of the Metaxas censorship, which was stricter in Athens. Vassilis Tsitsanis wrote some of his best songs in Thessaloniki.\n\nThe city is the birthplace of significant composers in the Greek music scene, such as Manolis Chiotis, Stavros Kouyioumtzis and Dionysis Savvopoulos. It is also notable for its rock music scene and its many rock groups; some became famous such as Xylina Spathia, Trypes or the pop rock Onirama.\n\nBetween 1962–1997 and 2005–2008 the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival. In the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 Greece was represented by Koza Mostra and Agathonas Iakovidis, both from Thessaloniki.\n\n\nThessaloniki is a major center of education for Greece. Three of the country's largest universities are located in central Thessaloniki: Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the University of Macedonia and the International Hellenic University. Aristotle University was founded in 1926 and is currently the largest university in Greece by number of students, which number at more than 80,000 in 2010, and is a member of the Utrecht Network. For the academic year 2009–2010, Aristotle University was ranked as one of the 150 best universities in the world for arts and humanities and among the 250 best universities in the world overall by the Times QS World University Rankings, making it one of the top 2% of best universities worldwide. Leiden ranks Aristotle University as one of the top 100 European universities and the best university in Greece, at number 97. Since 2010, Thessaloniki is also home to the Open University of Thessaloniki, which is funded by Aristotle University, the University of Macedonia and the municipality of Thessaloniki.\n\nAdditionally, a TEI (Technological Educational Institute), namely the Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki, is located in the western suburb of Sindos; home also to the industrial zone of the city. Numerous public and private vocational institutes () provide professional training to young students, while a large number of private colleges offer American and UK academic curriculum, via cooperation with foreign universities. In addition to Greek students, the city hence attracts many foreign students either via the Erasmus programme for public universities, or for a complete degree in public universities or in the city's private colleges. the city's total student population was estimated around 200,000.\n\nPublic transport in Thessaloniki is served by buses. The bus company operating in the city is the Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH) and is the only public means of transport in Thessaloniki at the moment. It operates a fleet of 604 vehicles on 75 routes throughout the Thessaloniki Metropolitan Area. International and regional bus links are provided by KTEL at its Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal, located to the west of the city centre.\n\nThe creation of a metro system for Thessaloniki goes back as far as 1918, when Thomas Hayton Mawson and Ernest Hébrard proposed the creation of a Thessaloniki Metropolitan Railway. In 1968 a circular metro line was proposed, and in 1987 the first serious proposal was presented and construction briefly started in 1988, before stalling and finally being abandoned due to lack of funding. Both the 1918 and 1988 proposals ran almost the identical route to the current Line 1.\n\nConstruction on Thessaloniki's current metro began in 2006 and is classified as a megaproject: it has a budget of €1.57 billion ($ billion). Line 1 and Line 2 are currently under construction and will enter service, in phases, between 2020 and 2021. Line 1 is long and stops at 13 stations, while Line 2 is long and stops at a further 5 stations, while also calling at 11 of the Line 1 stations. Important archaeological discoveries have been made during construction, and some of the system's stations will house archaeological exhibitions. One stop, , will house the only open archaeological site within a metro station anywhere in the world.\n\nLine 2 is to be expanded further, with a loop extension to the western suburbs of the city, towards Evosmos and Stavroupoli, and one overground extension towards the Airport. The western extension is more high-priority than the airport one, as the airport will be served by a 10-minute shuttle bus to the terminus of Line 2, .\n\nOnce opened in 2020, it is expected that 320,000 people will use the metro every day, or 116 million people every year.\n\nCommuter rail services have recently been established between Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa (the service is known in Greek as the \"Proastiakos\", meaning \"Suburban Railway\"). The service is operated using Siemens Desiro EMU trains on a modernised electrified double track and stops at 11 refurbished stations, covering the journey in 1 hour and 33 minutes. Furthermore, an additional line has also been established, although with the use of regional trains, between Thessaloniki and the city of Edessa.\n\nInternational and domestic air traffic to and from the city is served by Thessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\". The short length of the airport's two runways means that it does not currently support intercontinental flights, although a major extension – lengthening one of its runways into the Thermaic Gulf – is under construction, despite considerable opposition from local environmental groups. Following the completion of the runway works, the airport will be able to serve intercontinental flights and cater for larger aircraft in the future. Construction of a second terminal began in September 2018, due to be completed in 2021.\n\nBecause of the Greek economic crisis, all international train links from the city were suspended in February 2011. Until then, the city was a major railway hub for the Balkans, with direct connections to Sofia, Skopje, Belgrade, Moscow, Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul, alongside Athens and other destinations in Greece. Daily through trains to Sofia and Belgrade were restarted in May 2014. Thessaloniki remains one of Greece's most important railway hubs and has the biggest marshalling yard in the country.\n\nRegional train services within Greece (operated by TrainOSE, the Hellenic Railways Organization's train operating company), link the city with other parts of the country, from its central railway passenger station, called the \"New railway station\" located at the western end of Thessaloniki's city center.\n\nThe Port of Thessaloniki connects the city with seasonal ferries to the Sporades and other north Aegean islands, with its passenger terminal, being one of the largest in the Aegean Sea basin; having handled around 162,731 passengers in 2007. Meanwhile, ongoing actions have been going on for more connections and the port is recently being upgraded, as Thessaloniki is also slowly turning into a major tourist port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThessaloniki lies on the crossroads of the A1/E75, A2/E90 and A25 motorways; which connect the city with other parts of the country, as well as the Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey.\n\nThe city itself is bypassed by the C-shaped Thessaloniki Inner Ring Road (\"Esoteriki Peripheriaki Odos\", ), which all of the above motorways connect onto it. The western end of the route begins at the junction with the A1/A2 motorways in \"Lachanagora\" District. Clockwise it heads northeast around the city, passing through the northwestern suburbs, the forest of \"Seich Sou\" and through to the southeast suburb/borough of Kalamaria. The ring road ends at a large junction with the A25 motorway, which then continues south to Chalkidiki, passing through Thessaloniki's outer southeast suburbs.\n\nThe speed limit on this motorway is , it currently has three traffic lanes for each direction and forms the city's most vital road link; handling more than 120,000 vehicles daily, instead of 30,000 as it was meant to handle when designed in 1975.\nAn outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (, \"outer ring road\") carries all traffic that completely bypasses the city. It is Part of Motorway 2\n\nDespite the large effort that was made in 2004 to improve the motorway features of the Thessaloniki ring road, the motorway is still insufficient to tackle Thessaloniki's increasing traffic and metropolitan population. To tackle this problem, the government has introduced large scale redevelopment plans throughout 2011 with tenders expected to be announced within early 2012; that include the total restructuring of the A16 in the western side of the city, with new junctions and new emergency lanes throughout the whole length of the motorway. In the eastern side an even larger scale project has been announced, for the construction of a new elevated motorway section above the existing, which would allow faster travel for drivers heading through to the airport and Chalkidiki that do not wish to exit into the city, and will decongest the existing motorway for city commuters. The plans also include adding one more lane in each direction on the existing A16 ring road and on the A25 passing through Thessaloniki's southeast suburbs, from its junction with the A16 in Kalamaria, up to the airport exit (ΕΟ67); which will make it an 8 lane highway.\n\nAdditional long term plans further include the extension of the planned outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (, \"outer ring road\") to circle around the entire Thessaloniki Metropolitan Area, crossing over the Thermaic Gulf from the east, to join with the A1/E75 motorway. Preliminary plans have been announced which include a bridge over the gulf, as part of the southern bypass of the city; to cater for the large number of commuters from Macedonia and the rest of Greece heading to the airport, and to the increasingly popular tourist region of Chalkidiki.\n\nConsulates\n\nThessaloniki is twinned with:\n\nModern Greece.\" Stanford Studies in Jewish History and Culture\nSeries.

The ERB meets monthly, but may also be convened sooner if an immediate need arises.\n\nThe ERB consists of representatives from the following agencies:\n\n\nThe National Security Agency serves as the executive secretariat for the VEP.\n\nAccording to the November 2017 version of the VEP, the process is as follows:\n\nWhen an agency finds a vulnerability, it will notify the VEP secretariat as soon as is possible. The notification will include a description of the vulnerability and the vulnerable products or systems, together with the agency's recommendation to either disseminate or restrict the vulnerability information.\n\nThe secretariat will then notify all participants of the submission within one business day, requesting them to respond if they have an relevant interest.\n\nAn agency expressing an interest must indicate whether it concurs with the original recommendation to disseminate or restrict within five business days. If it does not, it will hold discussions with the submitting agency and the VEP secretariat within seven business days to attempt to reach consensus. If no consensus is reached, the participants will suggest options for the Equities Review Board.\n\nDecisions whether to disclose or restrict a vulnerability should be made quickly, in full consultation with all concerned agencies, and in the overall best interest of the competing interests of the missions of the U.S. government. As far as possible, determinations should be based on rational, objective methodologies, taking into account factors such as prevalence, reliance, and severity. \n\nIf the review board members cannot reach consensus, they will vote on a preliminary determination. If an agency with an equity disputes that decision, they may, by providing notice to the VEP secretariat, elect to contest the preliminary determination. If no agency contests a preliminary determination, it will be treated as a final decision.\n\nIf vulnerability information is released, this will be done as quickly as possible, preferably within seven business days. \n\nDisclosure of vulnerabilities will be conducted according to guidelines agreed on by all members. The submitting agency is presumed to be most knowledgeable about the vulnerability and, as such, will be responsible for disseminating vulnerability information to the vendor. The submitting agency may elect to delegate dissemination responsibility to another agency on its behalf.\n\nThe releasing agency will promptly provide a copy of the disclosed information to the VEP secretariat for record keeping. Additionally, the releasing agency is expected to follow-up so the ERB can determine whether the vendor’s action meets government requirements. If the vendor chooses not to address a vulnerability, or is not acting with urgency consistent with the risk of the vulnerability, the releasing agency will notify the secretariat, and the government may take other mitigation steps.\n\nThe VEP process has been criticized for a number of deficiencies, including restriction by non-disclosure agreements, lack of risk ratings, special treatment for the NSA, and less than whole-hearted commitment to disclosure as the default option.\n\n"}
{"id": "189716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189716", "title": "William Stukeley", "text": "William Stukeley\n\nWilliam Stukeley (7 November 1687 – 3 March 1765) was an English antiquarian, physician, and Anglican clergyman. A significant influence on the later development of archaeology, he pioneered the scholarly investigation of the prehistoric monuments of Stonehenge and Avebury in Wiltshire.\n\nBorn in Holbeach, Lincolnshire as the son of a lawyer, Stukeley worked in his father's law business before attending Bene't College, Cambridge. In 1709 he began studying medicine at St Thomas' Hospital, Southwark, before working as a general practitioner in Boston, Lincolnshire. From 1710 till 1725 he embarked on annual tours of the countryside, seeking out archaeological monuments and other features that interested him; he wrote up and published several accounts of his travels. In 1717, he returned to London and established himself within the city's antiquarian circles. In 1718 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and became the first secretary of the Society of Antiquaries of London. In 1721 he became a Freemason and in 1722 co-founded the Society of Roman Knights, an organisation devoted to the study of Roman Britain. In the early 1720s, Stukeley developed a particular interest in Stonehenge and Avebury, two prehistoric stone circles in Wiltshire. He visited them repeatedly, undertaking fieldwork to determine their dimensions. \n\nIn 1726 Stukeley relocated to Grantham, Lincolnshire, where he married. In 1729 he was ordained as a cleric in the Church of England and appointed vicar of All Saints' Church in Stamford, Lincolnshire. He was a friend of the Archbishop of Canterbury William Wake, who encouraged him to use his antiquarian studies to combat the growth of deism and freethought in Britain. To this end, Stukeley developed the belief that Britain's ancient druids had followed a monotheistic religion inherited from the Biblical Patriarchs; he called this druidic religion \"Patriarchal Christianity\". He further argued that the druids had erected the stone circles as part of serpentine monuments symbolising the Trinity. He was instrumental in British scholarship's acceptance of Charles Bertram's forged \"Description of Britain\". A friend of Isaac Newton, he was also among Newton's first biographers. In 1747 he returned to London as rector of St George the Martyr, Holborn.\n\nHe has been described as \"probably ... the most important of the early forerunners of the discipline of archaeology\" for his practice of personally visiting and examining ancient sites. He has since become the subject of multiple biographies and academic studies.\n\nStukeley was born in 1687 and grew up in Holbeach, Lincolnshire. He was the eldest child in a family of four boys and one girl. His paternal grandfather, John Stukeley (1623–1675), was a country gentleman who possessed a small estate at Uffington, Lincolnshire and who accrued a large number of debts by the time of his death. John had two sons; the elder, Adlard, was apprenticed to the legal profession, while the younger, also called John, was initially trained as a farmer before joining Adlard in a family law firm. John married, with his wife later giving birth to William.\n\nAt the age of five, Stukeley began an education at Holbeach's Free School. By the age of thirteen, he was the top-rated pupil at his school. In 1700, he was taken out of school to work in his father's legal business. He was nevertheless bored by his law activities, and when he requested that he be allowed to study at university, his father agreed. He began studying at Cambridge University in 1703 as a pensioner at Bene't College. Among the classes that he took during his studies were Classics, Ethics, Logic, Metaphysics, Divinity, Mathematics, and Philosophy. In 1705 his father died, with his uncle also passing away three weeks later. He returned home to sort out the family's financial affairs. In 1707 his mother then died, leaving him in charge of his younger siblings; to pay off family debts, he sold off their furniture and let out their Holbeach home. He also attracted local attention for dissecting a local who had committed suicide.\nIn 1708 he took his degree. By this point he was taking a growing interest in architecture, producing careful pen-drawings of medieval buildings.\n\nIn August 1709, Stukeley moved to London to further pursue medicine under doctor Richard Mead at St Thomas' Hospital. In March 1710, he left the city to practice medicine in the countryside, establishing a practice in Boston, Lincolnshire. Little is known of the time that he spent in the town, although in 1713 he was accorded Freedom of the Town. In 1715 he produced a print of Boston's St Botolph's Church, which he dedicated to the Marquis of Lindsey. Many of his travels around Lincolnshire were written up in what appears to be his first book, \"Iter Domesticum\", although the year of its publication is not known.\n\nFrom 1710 until 1725, Stukeley embarked on a horseback expedition through the countryside at least once a year, taking notes on the things that he observed. At the time, his interests were not purely antiquarian, for he also took notes on landscape gardens and other more recent constructions that he encountered. In 1712, Stukeley embarked on an extensive tour of western Britain, taking in Wales before returning to England to visit Grantham, Derby, Buxton, Chatsworth, and Manchester. He later published an account of these travels in Western Britain as \"Iter Cimbricum\". Stukeley's later biographer Stuart Piggott related that this book was \"not yet the characteristic product of a field archaeologist\" but rather \"differs little from that which could be written by any intelligent gentleman of the period\".\n\nStukeley befriended the antiquary Maurice Johnson and joined Johnson's learned society, the Spalding Gentlemen's Society, which was based in Spalding, Lincolnshire.\nA 1714 letter indicates that Johnson recommended several books on British history to Stukeley, apparently at the latter's request; the suggested titles included Julius Caesar's \"De Bello Gallico\", John Milton's \"The History of Britain\", Robert Brady's \"An Introduction to the Old English History\", Peter Heylin's \"Help to English History\", and Richard Rowlands' \"A Restitution of Decayed Intelligence in Antiquities concerning the most noble and renowned English Nation\". Another letter to Johnson, this time from May 1714, reveals that Stukeley was assembling a series of chronological tables of all British kings since Brutus of Troy; following the medieval historian Geoffrey of Monmouth, Stukeley believed that the legendary Brutus was a real historical figure.\n\nIn September 1716, he wrote an account of Richborough Castle, a Roman military fort in Kent. That same year, he described having made a model of the Neolithic/Bronze Age stone circle of Stonehenge.\n\nBy May 1717, Stukeley had returned to London, where he was living in Great Ormond Street. The reasons for his return to the city are not known, although it is perhaps due to his desire to once again be among the London intelligentsia. Once in the city he began to circulate within its antiquarian circles. At Mead's nomination, in early 1718 he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, then under the presidency of the scientist Isaac Newton. That same year he became a member of the newly founded Society of Antiquaries of London, becoming its first secretary. He nevertheless appears to have taken little active part in the society's business. In 1721–22 he was partly instrumental in setting up the society's committee on coins. He also retained his interest in medical matters, and in October 1720 was one of the physicians who conducted an autopsy of a deceased elephant in Hans Sloane's Chelsea garden.\n\nIn London, he developed a friendship with two brothers who shared many of his antiquarian interests, Roger and Samuel Gale. From his father, the former Dean of York Thomas Gale, Roger had inherited a copy of the \"Monumenta Britannica\", a work produced by seventeenth-century antiquarian John Aubrey. He showed it to Stukeley, who produced a transcription of Aubrey's document in either 1717 or 1718. Piggott suggested that it was Aubrey's manuscript that first brought Avebury to Stukeley's attention. Circa 1718, Stukeley first visited the site, accompanied by the Gale brothers. In 1719, he visited again, also taking in Stonehenge before traveling to Oxford to meet Thomas Hearne, an antiquarian who was highly critical of Stukeley. That summer, he spent time in Great Chesterford in Essex, where he identified a Romano-British temple from crop marks in a field. \n\nStukeley devoted much attention to Avebury during the 1720s. The records he produced of how the monument and its various features looked at the time has left later archaeologists \"permanently in his debt\" for by the early twentieth century—when the earliest sustained archaeological investigation of the site took place—many of these features had been lost. He witnessed locals breaking up megaliths in the circle and although powerless to stop them it may have been this observation that led him to produce a detailed record of the site.\n\nIn January 1721, Stukeley was initiated as a Freemason. He suspected that Freemasonry was the \"remains of the mysterys of the antients [sic]\". By 1723 he was the Master of the Masonic Lodge meeting at Fountain Tavern on London's Strand. In July 1722, he and several friends formed the Society of Roman Knights, an organisation devoted to the study of Roman Britain. The group began with sixteen members before attracting new recruits over the following two years. In admitting women as well as men, the Society was unprecedented within British society at the time; the Society of Antiquaries for instance would not admit female members for another two centuries. Members of the Roman Knights each took a name from the Romano-British period; Stukeley's was \"Chyndonax\", the name of a priest listed in a Greek inscription reputedly found in a glass cinerary urn in 1598. Through the society he also became close friends with Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford and Heneage Finch, 5th Earl of Winchilsea; he encouraged the latter to carry out archaeological fieldwork, as at Julliberrie's Grave in Kent.\n\nIn August 1721, Stukeley and Roger Gale set forth on another tour, visiting Avebury and Stonehenge before going to Gloucester, Hereford, Ludlow, Wolverhampton, Derby, and finally reaching Grantham in October. He wrote up his notes of the journey as \"Iter Sabrinum\". He returned to Avebury in the summer of 1722—this time with the artists Gerard Vandergucht and John Pine, who had both become Roman Knights that year—before proceeding to Stonehenge and Silchester. In September and October he embarked on another tour, this time taking in Cambridge, Boston, Lincoln, Dunstable, Leminster, and Rochester, largely following Roman roads. He published a description of this tour as \"Iter Romanum\". In 1723, he travelled from London to Newbury and Marlborough before visiting Stanton Drew stone circles, and then heading back east to Bath, Exeter, and Dorchester. These tours were written up as \"Iter Dumnoniense\" and \"Iter Septimum Antonini Aug\". He also wrote an account of Dorcehster's Maumbury Rings in October 1723 as \"Of the Roman Ampitheatre at Dorchester\". \n\nIt was while at Avebury in 1723 that he began a draft of the \"History of the Temples of the Ancient Celts\". This work drew upon his fieldwork at both Avebury and Stonehenge as well as his field-notes from other prehistoric sites and information obtained from the 'Templa Druidum' section of Aubrey's \"Monumenta Britannica\". The work also cited Biblical and Classical texts. In the book, Stukeley discussed how prehistoric people might have erected such monuments using sledges, timber cradles, rollers, and leavers. He devoted much space to refuting the suggestion, made by Inigo Jones and J. Webb, that Stonehenge had been erected by the Romans, instead attributing it to the prehistoric—or as he called it, \"Celtic\"—period. The druids are mentioned only briefly in the book, when Stukeley suggested that they might be possible creators of the stone circles. \n\nIn 1724, Stukeley returned to Avebury and Stonehenge, returning via Ringwood and Romsey before heading up to Lincoln and then back down to Kent later in the year. This was the final year in which he conducted fieldwork at Avebury. In 1725, Stukeley engaged in the last of his great tours, this time with Roger Gale. This took him from Dunstable up into the Midlands, where he visited Coventry, Birmingham, Derby, and Buxton before heaving west to Chester and then north for Liverpool and the Lake District; there he visited stone circles like Long Meg and Her Daughters and Castlerigg stone circle. From there, Stukeley and Gale travelled further north to Whitehaven and then Hadrian's Wall, following it along to Newcastle before heading south back to London via Durham and Doncaster.\n\nIn 1726, Stukeley left London and relocated to Grantham in Lincolnshire. The reasons for his decision to do so are obscure. It may be that he left the city due to frustration that his antiquarian research was not being financially supported by wealthier benefactors. On his move to Grantham, Stukeley resigned as secretary of the Society of Antiquaries. Towards the end of the year he married Frances Williamson, daughter of a gentleman from Allington. The couple's attempts to conceive children met with failure, and Williamson suffered two miscarriages. In October 1728, Stukeley buried the second of the two unborn infants in his garden, performing a funeral ceremony that drew upon his interest in ancient Roman practices.\n\nStukeley was friendly with the Archbishop of Canterbury William Wake, who shared his interest in antiquarianism. Stukeley asked his friend if he may become a cleric in the Church of England, a request which Wake granted in June 1729. Wake ordained him as a deacon in Croydon on 20 July 1729.\nGiven his intellectual pursuits, Wake saw Stukeley as a welcome recruit in the Church of England's conflict with Freethought. In October 1729, the Lord Chancellor Peter King granted Stukeley the living of All Saints in Stamford, Lincolnshire, taking up residence in the town in early 1730. He enjoyed the town's medieval architecture, and began to write a history of the settlement in the form of a dialogue. He also enjoyed gardening while living in the town, in 1738 building a \"Hermitage\" in his garden, which featured niches, a stone arch, and a fountain.\n\nAccording to Piggott, Stukeley's ordination was \"the essential turning-point in his whole life\". His reasons for joining the clergy are not known for certain. One possibility is that he sought the steady wage supplied by the Church of England, having for a while complained about how little he earned as a doctor. Alternately, he may have believed that becoming a cleric would be a secure position from which he could pursue the unorthodox ideas he was developing. His decision to join the clergy concerned friends like Robert Gale. To Piggott, Stukeley sought to use his fieldwork \"as ammunition in a holy war against the Deists\". Stukeley would write that his purpose in becoming a cleric was \"to combat the deists from an unexpected quarter\", describing his \"resentment of that deluge of profaneness and infidelity that prevails so much at present, and threatens an utter subversion of religion in general\".\n\nIn 1736, he co-founded a local antiquarian and literary society, The Brazen Nose, with six other founder-members. It held weekly meetings at which they discussed a varied range of subjects; the first meeting involved discussions of astronomy, lunar maps, a wasp's nest, a medieval seal, and a bladder stone the size of a walnut that had been retrieved from a small dog. The society eventually lapsed, and Stukeley's attempt to revive it in 1746 proved unsuccessful. He also remained interested in the local discovery of antiquities; he became aware of a large, silver Romano-British dish uncovered at Risley Park, Derbyshire in 1729 and read an account of it to the Society of Antiquaries in 1736. In October 1742, Stukeley was alerted to the discovery of the Royston Cave by local politician William Goodhall. He wrote about the site in his 1743 book, \"Palaeographia Britannica No. I\"', in which he argued that the cave's decorated chamber was established as a hermitage for a Lady Roisia de Vere circa 1170. A 1744 pamphlet was then issued by the Reverend Charles Parkin, arguing that the carvings were Anglo-Saxon in origin. Stukeley was affronted by the suggestion, and wrote his 1746 \"Origines Roystonianae II\" in response to it. In 1740, he was removed as a member of the Society of Antiquaries for not renewing his membership dues.\n\nIn 1740, he published \"Stonehenge\", a book that he described as being devoted to the subject of \"Patriarchal Christianity\". He believed that learned people would read the book to learn about stone circles and druids, and that in doing so they would encounter the ancient proto-Christian of Britain and thus recognise how similar it was to modern Anglicanism. In doing so, he believed, they would reject the ideas promoted by deism and the freethinkers.\n\nIn the winter of 1737, Stukeley's wife died at the age of forty. By February 1737/38 he suggested to Samuel Gale that they live together, although this plan never came to fruition. In 1739, Stukeley married the Gale brothers' sister, bringing her to live with him at Stamford. Her marriage portion of £10,000 allowed Stukeley to maintain two houses from 1740 onward. Summers were spent at Stamford while winters were spent in his home in Gloucester Street, London.\n\nWhen in London, he regularly attended meetings of the Royal Society. In December 1741, he was appointed an associate member of the Egyptian Society, a group led by Lord Sandwich as its first president. Through the society, Stukeley became friends with the Second Duke of Montagu, regularly visiting the latter's home at Boughton House, Northamptonshire. Inspired by the medieval Gothic buildings, he began designing various Gothic plans of his own. This included a Gothic bridge and a mausoleum designed for the Duke of Montagu's estate, although neither were ever built.\n\nIn 1746, Stukeley drew up a very careful account of King Charles I's journey from Oxford to the Scottish camp at Newark in 1646.\n\nIn late 1747, Stukeley became the rector for St George the Martyr, Queen Square, a parish in Bloomsbury, London. He moved permanently to the city in February 1748. In June 1747, Stukeley had received a letter from Charles Bertram, an Englishman living in Denmark. In their ensuing correspondence, Bertram claimed to possess a copy of a manuscript produced by a 14th century monk from Winchester known as Richard of Cirencester, which in turn contained an account and map of Roman Britain. Stukeley expressed caution regarding Bertram's claims, asking for detailed information regarding the original manuscript's provenance, with Bertram responding that he could not provide any because he had been sworn to secrecy by the man who supplied him with it. Stukeley unsuccessfully attempted to buy the manuscript from Bertram, stating that he would deposit it in the library of the British Museum. In March and again in April 1756, Stukeley read papers on Bertram's manuscript to the Society of Antiquaries of London. He published these in 1757 as \"An Account of Richard of Cirencester, Monk of Westminster, and of his Works\", which reproduced the map but not the text of the original manuscript, instead consisting of Stukeley's own commentary.\nIn 1795, Thomas Reynolds declared that Bertram's document was a forgery, although this would only be widely recognised in the 19th century.\n\nStukeley was a friend of Isaac Newton and wrote a memoir of his life in 1752. This is one of the earliest sources for the story of the falling apple that inspired Newton's formulation of the theory of gravitation. \n\nStukeley also displayed a growing interest in the Roman Emperor Carausius and his coinage. In 1750, he and John Kennedy saw a sketch of a silver coin that had been discovered at Silchester and donated to the King of France. Both of them misread the legend on the reverse of the coin, believing that it read \"ORIVNA\"; it had actually read \"FORTVNA\", but with the \"F\" largely eroded. In 1751, Kennedy published his \"Dissertation on Oriuna\", in which he claimed that Oriuna was the guardian goddess of Carausius. Stukeley disagreed, believing that Oriuna was Carausius' wife; he published this argument as \"Palaeographia Britannica No. III\" in 1752.\n\nIn 1753, a Late Bronze Age tool hoard was uncovered during landscaping at Kew Gardens; Stukeley was invited to come and inspect the discovery the following year, at which point he met with the Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, who had an interest in antiquarian matters. In 1754, he was re-admitted to the Society of Antiquaries. That same year, one of Stukeley's parishioners died, leaving his book collection to the Bodleian Library and Lincoln College, Oxford. Stukeley was left as one of his executors, and in May 1755 transported the book collection to Oxford. Following the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, Stukeley developed an active interest in the subject, presenting papers on earthquakes to the Royal Society and in 1750 publishing \"Philosophy of Earthquakes, Natural and Religious\".\n\nThe last decade of Stukeley's life was—according to Piggott—\"relatively uneventful\". He had re-joined the Society of Antiquaries but the papers presented there were increasingly treated in-seriously, while at the Royal Society, his papers were turned down and not published in its \"Transactions\". He retained his concern with the destruction of ancient monuments, in particular the pillaging of Hadrian's Wall for stone, imploring Princess Augusta to intervene and raising the issue in a November 1757 report for the Society of Antiquaries. He also raised concerns about the sturdiness of the Eleanor cross at Waltham Cross and ensured it was renovated.\n\nIn 1757, Stukeley's second wife died.\nIn 1759, Stukeley purchased a cottage in the (then largely rural) area of Kentish Town. In 1763 he published \"Paleographia Sacra, or Discourses on Sacred Subject\" as a collection of some of his Sunday sermons.\nIn early 1765, Stukeley fell into a coma and remained in this state for three days before dying in his bed on 3 March. He was buried without a monument in the churchyard of St Mary Magdalene's Church, East Ham, which he is said to have selected as his resting-place on a visit there during his lifetime.\n\nHutton noted that Stukeley \"always had a strong streak of mysticism and interpreted ancient remains in accordance with set notions concerning the nature of primeval religion.\" He had a strong belief in immanent divinity. His belief in an immanent and interconnected divinity led him to adopt ideas from Pythagoreanism and Neoplatonism: from the former he adopted the belief that music and numbers expressed the divine order while from the latter he adopted the notion of hidden correspondences between various parts of the natural world.\n\nFew of Stukeley's ideas were not wholly original, being based on earlier sources. His general framework for understanding Britain's prehistoric past derived from his belief in the literal truth of Biblical mythology, including the creation of the world in 4004 BC and events like the Genesis flood narrative. There is no evidence that when he started investigating Avebury and Stonehenge in 1719 that he regarded them as having been erected by the druids. At the time, many antiquarians believed that they had been created in more recent periods; Inigo Jones believed Stonehenge had been built by Romans, Walter Charleton by Danish invaders in the Anglo-Saxon period, while Edmund Bolton attributed it to the ancient British but not specifically the druids. In adopting the idea that the druids had erected these monuments, he was following the ideas of Aubrey, which he had read in unpublished manuscript form.\n\nStukeley believed that the druids were part of \"an oriental colony\" of Phoenicians who had settled in Britain between the end of Noah's flood and the time of Abraham. He stated that the druids were \"of Abraham's religion intirely [sic]\" and that, although never having encountered divine revelation, had concluded through their own reasoning that God existed as a Trinity. He also stated that their religion was \"so extremely like Christianity, that in effect in differ'd from it only in this; they believed in a Messiah who was to come into this world, as we believe in him that is come.\"\n\nHe believed that the leader of these Phoenician druids had been Hercules, who had landed in western Britain and created the Boscawen-Un circle in Cornwall. The idea that Hercules had arrived in southwest Britain was not original to Stukeley, having been adopted from Aylett Sammes' \"Britannia Antiqua Illustrata\" from 1676.\nStukeley also believed that, because of Britain's isolated location, the druids had preserved this ancient monotheistic religion, and that \"the true religion has chiefly, since the repeopling of mankind after the flood, subsisted in our land\".\n\nHis idea that the druids once formed a monotheistic priesthood akin to those of modern Christians also owed an influence from older sources. Michael Drayton's 1612 poem \"Poly-Olbion\" had for instance portrayed them as wise, monotheistic sages and philosophers.\n\nBy the time he became a cleric, he believed that the ancient Egyptians, Plato, and the druids all accepted the existence of the Trinity.\nBy June 1730, he was claiming that Avebury was a symbolic depiction of the Trinity. He believed that ancient humans had venerated the components of the cosmos, such as the heavenly bodies and the four elements, and that they recognized the numbers and musical harmonies from which the cosmos had been created.\n\nPiggott described Stukeley as \"a gregarious creature\" who enjoyed conversation and being flattered. Piggott also highlighted \"an immensely likeable quality\" to Stukeley's personality, as evidence highlighting that when the reverend was laid up in bed in Queens Square on one occasion, over 120 friends and parishioners either visited him or sent him a message of sympathy.\nHe also regarded the antiquary as displaying a \"charm and pleasant oddness\" as well as a \"cheerfulness and disarming ingenuousness\".\nPiggott also noted that in later life, Stukeley became \"self-opinionated\" and \"dogmatic\".\n\nAfter the antiquarian's death, Bishop Warburton stated that in Stukeley displayed \"a mixture of simplicity, drollery, absurdity, ingenuity, superstition and antiquarianism, that he afforded me that kind of well-seasoned repast, which the French call an \"Ambigu\", I suppose from a compound of things never meant to meet together.\"\n\nAccording to Hutton, Stukeley had \"a profound and lifelong love of structure, form and design\" that was reflected in his interest in the medieval profession as well as antiquities.\nHe had an enthusiasm for gardening, and according to Piggott took \"delight in the English countryside\". Fond of pets, he reported feeling great grief following the death of his cat, Tit, in the 1740s.\n\nStukeley's decision, in 1722, to adopt the pseudonym of Chyndonax reflected his inclinations towards identifying with the druids in a personal capacity. This was bolstered by the tendency of friends in the Society of Roman Knights to refer to him, both in conversation and correspondence, as \"the Druid\".\n\nAccording to his biographer, Stuart Piggott, Stukeley was the \"central figure of early eighteenth-century archaeology\". The historian Ronald Hutton called him \"perhaps the most important forefather of the discipline of archaeology\".\n\nThe first edition of Piggott's biography of Stukeley was published in 1950, with a revised edition released in 1985.\n\nPiggott thought him \"one of the most curious and complex of the English eccentrics, pathetic, charming, admirable, and laughable by turns.\" Piggott believed that Stukeley's folios of Avebury and Stonehenge were his \"most important contributions to archaeology\". He noted that the antiquarian's plan of Avebury, \"though failing by modern standards of accuracy, was nevertheless a very much better achievement than anything that had been produced before\". Piggott's ultimate assessment was that Stukeley \"was not a good scholar: he was uncritical of his literary sources and his reading was discursive rather than profound. His value to archaeology in his own day and now lies in his capacity to observe and record facts in the open air.\" He situated Stukeley's intellectual failings within the wider context of British intellectual decline in the years following 1730.\n\nPiggott referred to the \"varying quality\" of Stukeley's work, believing there to have been a \"lamentable decline in his later life\". He believed that Stukeley had moved from a \"neutral empiricism to an often wildly speculative religious interpretation\" of prehistoric archaeology.\nIn 2005, Hutton noted that there had been \"a considerable change of attitude\" to Stukeley among scholars over the previous few years, as they had rejected the division into two halves of his life which Piggott had constructed.\n\nStukeley was the first person to identify the Stonehenge Avenue and Stonehenge Cursus, giving these featured the names by which they are now known.\n\nBy the early 1720s, Stukeley had a growing reputation as the country's main authority on druids and ancient monuments, having no obvious competitor given the comparative novelty of studying stone circles.\nBy the 1750s, some of Stukeley's contemporaries were criticising the accuracy of some of his plans.\nBy 1740, he was beginning to depict the stone circles at Avebury—which are perfectly circular—as ovals in his illustrations so that they better fitted the shape of a serpent's head, which he believed they symbolised.\n\nPiggott noted that Stukeley's speculations on druids, \"which seem to us so childishly fantastic\", shaped the literary mood of the romantic revival.\n\n \n\nAttribution:\n\n\n"}
