{"id": "1216758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1216758", "title": "Bo Yang", "text": "Bo Yang\n\nBo Yang (; 7 March 1920 – 29 April 2008), sometimes also erroneously called Bai Yang, was a Chinese poet, essayist and historian based in Taiwan. He is also regarded as a social critic. According to his own memoir, the exact date of his birthday was unknown even to himself. He later adopted 7 March, the date of his 1968 imprisonment, as his birthday.\n\nBoyang was born as Guō Dìngshēng (郭定生) in Kaifeng, Henan Province, China, with family origins in Huixian. Boyang's father changed his son's name to Guō Lìbāng (郭立邦) to facilitate a transfer to another school. Bo Yang later changed his name to Guo Yìdòng, also spelled Kuo I-tung (郭衣洞). In high school, Boyang participated in youth organisations of the Kuomintang, the then-ruling party of the Republic of China, and joined the Kuomintang itself in 1938. He graduated from the National Northeastern University, and moved to Taiwan after the Kuomintang lost the civil war in 1949.\n\nIn 1950, he was imprisoned for six months for listening to Communist Chinese radio broadcasts. He had various jobs during his life, including that of a teacher. During this time, he began to write novels. In 1960, he began using the pen name Boyang when he started to write a political commentary column in the \"Independent Evening News\". The name was derived from a place name in the mountains of Taiwan; he adopted it because he liked the sound of it. In 1961, he achieved acclaim with his novel \"The Alien Realm\" (異域 \"Yìyù\"), which told the story of a Kuomintang force which fought on in the borderlands of southwestern China long after the government had retreated to Taiwan. He became director of the Pingyuan Publishing House in 1966, and also edited the cartoon page of \"China Daily\" (中華日報).\n\nBoyang was arrested again in 1967 because of his sarcastic \"unwitting\" criticism of Taiwan's dictator Chiang Kai-shek and in particular a translation of a comic strip of Popeye. In the strip, Popeye and Swee'Pea have just landed on an uninhabited island. Popeye says: \"You can be crown prince,\" to which Swee'Pea responds, \"I want to be president.\" In the next panel, Popeye says, \"Why, you little...\" In the final panel, Popeye's words are too faint to be made out. Chiang was displeased because he saw this as a parody of his arrival (with a defeated army) in Taiwan, his brutal usurpation of the Presidency (a KMT competitor favored as head of government by the Truman administration was executed) and his strategy of slowly installing his son Chiang Ching-kuo as heir apparent. Boyang translated the word \"fellows\" as \"my fellow soldiers and countrymen,\" a phrase used by Chiang Kai-shek. Having detained Bo Yang, the KMT's “military interrogators told him that he could be beaten to death at any time the authorities desired” when the writer refused to swallow their trumped-up charges. “Several interrogators” including Liu Chan-hua and Kao Yi-rue “played cat and mouse with him, alternating promise of immediate release with threats” and torture. In order to make him confess, they broke his leg. Western allies of the regime were not unaware of this. Shelley Rigger says that “Peng Ming-min, Bo Yang and Lei Chen” were “high -profile White Terror cases” in the 1960s but in fact, many “(t)housands of Taiwanese and Mainlanders were swept up by the White Terror, suffering imprisonment, torture, (…) execution.” The prosecutor initially sought the death sentence but due to US pressure this was reduced to twelve years in the Green Island concentration camp. From 1969 Bo Yang was incarcerated as a political prisoner (for \"being a Communist agent and attacking national leaders\") on Green Island for nine years. The original 12-year sentence was commuted to eight years after the death of Chiang Kai-shek in 1975. However, the government refused to release Bo Yang after his sentence expired, and released him only in 1977, giving in to pressure from international organizations such as Amnesty International. After his release, Bo Yang continued to campaign for human rights and democracy in Taiwan.Towards the end of his life Bo Yang stated in his memoirs that he did not have the slightest intention to insult Chiang Kai-shek with his \"Popeye\" translation. This was due to the fact that in his view objective criticism mattered whereas personal insults were irrelevant.\n\nLin Zi-yao notes that during his life “Bo Yang covered a wide range of subjects from culture, literature, politics and education to love, marriage, family planning, fashion and women.” Much of this is not fiction, although he also published a significant body of short stories, novels, and poetry.\n\nAside from his Golden Triangle novel Yiyu, (異域, 1961), Boyang is best known for his non-fiction works on Chinese history (collated and translated into modern colloquial Chinese from historical records in the prison library on Green Island) and \"The Ugly Chinaman\" (醜陋的中國人 \"Chǒulòu de Zhōngguórén\", 1985; English translation, with the subtitle \"... and the Crisis of Chinese Culture\", 1992). In the introduction to excerpts from \"The Ugly Chinaman\", the editors of an anthology entitled \"Sources of Chinese Tradition from 1600 through the Twentieth Century\" state that “(t)he sharply negative tone of the (…) essay reflects a sense of (…) despair (…) as well as a feeling that age-old weaknesses have persisted through revolutionary change.” Also referring to \"The Ugly Chinaman\", Rana Mitter says that Bo Yang's position as a critical observer and analyst of the world is similar to Lu Xun's. Edward M. Gunn agrees, saying that “(t)he fact that Bo Yang is a prolific author of satirical essays (zawen) inevitably recalls the work of Lu Xun.” Gunn also emphasizes Bo Yang's “particular interest in history” and the “acerbic wit in defense of democracy and social welfare” (or social rights of the common people).\nBo Yang gained attention internationally when a volume of poetry entitled \"Poems of a Period\" was published in Hong Kong in 1986. These poems recall his arrest and imprisonment.\n\nBo Yang lived in Taipei in his later years. He became the founding president of the Taiwan chapter of Amnesty International. In 1994, Boyang underwent heart surgery, and his health never fully recovered. He carried the honorary title of national policy advisor to the administration of President Chen Shui-bian. In 2006, Boyang retired from writing, and donated the bulk of his manuscripts to the Chinese Modern Literature Museum in Beijing. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the National Tainan University, to which he also donated many memorabilia and some manuscripts.\n\nBoyang died of pneumonia in a hospital near his Xindian residence on 29 April 2008. He was married five times, and is survived by his last wife, Chang Hsiang-hua, and five children born by his former wives. On 17 May 2008, his ashes were scattered along the seashore of Green Island, where he was once imprisoned.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46862086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46862086", "title": "Bonifaciu Florescu", "text": "Bonifaciu Florescu\n\nBonifaciu Florescu (first name also Boniface, Bonifacio, Bonifati, last name also Floresco; born Bonifacius Florescu; May 1848 – December 18, 1899) was a Romanian polygraph, the illegitimate son of writer-revolutionary Nicolae Bălcescu. Born secretly outside his parents' native Wallachia, at Pest, he was taken by his aristocratic mother in France, growing up as an erudite Francophone and Francophile. Florescu graduated from the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and the University of Rennes, returning home at age 25 to become a successful lecturer, polemicist, and historian of culture. Influenced by his father's politics, he was for a while a prominent figure on the far-left of Romanian liberalism and nationalism, which pitted him against the conservative society \"Junimea\", and against his own conservative cousin, Prime Minister Ion Emanuel Florescu. The conflict led to his losing a professorship at Iași University and being sidelined when applying for chairs at the University of Bucharest. His critique of \"Junimist\" literature, structured around a classical defense of prosody, inspired a libel by Mihai Eminescu—famously depicting Florescu as a \"homunculus\".\n\nFlorescu had significant success as a self-proclaimed irredentist, agitating for Romanian causes in disputed Bukovina and Transylvania. Ultimately, however, he failed in his bid to rise through the National Liberal Party, as the latter moved to the center, and fell back on independent journalism, founding several periodicals of his own. He had a long but interrupted collaboration with another dissident liberal and poet, Alexandru Macedonski, who co-opted him on his \"Literatorul\" editing team during the 1880s. A precursor, but not an affiliate, of the Romanian Symbolist movement, Florescu had steadier friendships with the younger Symbolists Mircea Demetriade and Iuliu Cezar Săvescu. His main contribution to pre-Symbolist \"belles-lettres\" is prose poetry in the manner of Catulle Mendès.\n\nA committed bohemian, whose lifestyle interfered with his literary output and his teaching job at Saint Sava, Florescu is sometimes read as a herald of decadent writing. He was important to the Macedonskian Symbolists for his familiarity with French culture, but was primarily an expert in 18th-century literature. His criticism, modeled on Villemain, Sainte-Beuve and Taine, was perceived as refined in its context, but later enlisted objections for its pedantry and amateurism. He was a prolific translator passionate about exotic topics, authoring some of the first Romanian versions of stories by Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nBorn a Wallachian subject, Bonifaciu Florescu descended from the boyar nobility: the Bălcescus recognized him as a family member; the Florescus, however, refused to accept that Nicolae Bălcescu was the father. His father's family, of lesser rank and prestige, had been founded by Father Necula, a Wallachian Orthodox parson, who purchased the Bălcești estate in 1766. Unusually rich for his social position, he bought for his sons small boyar offices. Despite taking the same name, Nicolae and his two brothers descended from the clan through their mother Zinca; she married \"Pitar\" Barbu sin Petre Căpitanul—a gentleman farmer of Prahova, who also owned townhouses in Bucharest. Barbu's financial troubles and quick death contributed to the family's marginalization.\n\nThe poet's mother, Alexandrina \"Luxița\" Florescu, claimed direct descent from Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave, and was the daughter of \"Logothete\" Iordache Florescu, as well as aunt of Ion Emanuel Florescu, the Wallachian militia chief. The family also had Greek and Albanian ancestors. Iordache, a Ghica on his mother's side, ran in the 1842 election for the Wallachian throne, under the \"Regulamentul Organic\" regime; his wife, Anica, was a Soutzos. At age 17, Luxița was married off to a Russian Pole, but divorced him in 1836, alleging that he was hypersexual; he was probably also an alcoholic. She may have then met Bălcescu at the Florescu home in Șerban-Vodă, Bucharest, which functioned as a club for progressive intellectuals; however, Bonifaciu was most likely conceived while the couple reunited in Paris. Reportedly, Bălcescu, ill with tuberculosis and absorbed by his conspiratorial work, informed Luxița that they could never be married, which she accepted.\nYouth from both families were deeply involved in the Wallachian revolution of 1848, which occurred some weeks after Bonifaciu's birth. Luxița was shielded by her brothers in the Kingdom of Hungary, without informing Nicolae of her whereabouts or her pregnancy, until after she delivered. Bonifaciu was thus born in Pest; his date of birth is variously given as May 14, May 17, or May 27. In July, he was baptized into Orthodoxy at a Pest chapel shared by the Greek and Romanian Orthodox churches. The baptismal record omits mention of his father's family name, but indicates his godfather as Inochentie Chițulescu (future Bishop of Buzău).\n\nBy July, Bălcescu had been appointed foreign minister of revolutionary Wallachia, but then a reshuffle pushed him into the background. Eventually, the Russian and Ottoman empires intervened militarily, and the revolutionaries were pushed into exile or imprisoned. Brothers Nicolae and Costache Bălcescu escaped to Paris, passing through insurgent Hungary; the third Bălcescu brother, Barbu, was taken to Istanbul as a hostage. Three of Luxița's brothers—Iancu, Dumitrache, and Costache Florescu—participated in the events, and played a part in the shootout with the loyalist Colonel Grigore Lăcusteanu, whom they eventually arrested. Unusually, Costache Florescu's daughter married Lăcusteanu's brother Iancu while the colonel was still in captivity. All three brothers were repressed during the foreign intervention: Iancu Florescu was arrested by the Russians and spent some eight years in Siberia, returning after the Crimean War removed Wallachia from the Russian sphere of influence; Costache and Dumitrache were taken into Ottoman custody, returning after nine years of exile in Bursa. While Iancu took up law practice, Dumitrache is best known for setting to music the poetry of Vasile Alecsandri.\n\nWith material support from Chițulescu, Luxița and her son returned to Wallachia in 1850. Although she only formally adopted Bonifaciu in 1858, to solidify his claim to the Florescu estate, he grew up knowing that the exiled Bălcescu was his father. Prevented from returning home (with a brief exception in August 1852, when he only met Zinca at Turnu Măgurele), Nicolae died in the Two Siciles (November 1852). His grave is presumed lost.\n\nLuxița and Bonifaciu were also largely absent from Wallachia as the country merged with Moldavia into the United Principalities (the basis for modern Romania). Bonifaciu attended Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris, living with his mother on Rue Saint-Jacques, and possibly obtaining a scholarship from the Romanian government. He grew up speaking French at home, and only later perfected his Romanian, which he always spoke with an accent and a guttural R. His impromptu versions of Romanian orthography reflected phonemic spelling with unusual consistency for his day, and they unwittingly recorded his own difficulties in pronouncing Romanian words. This trait was ridiculed by philologist Hanes Suchianu as the very \"apex of phoneticism\".\n\nFamiliarized with Bălcescu's works by age 17, Bonifaciu declared his father to have been a \"genius\", \"Romania's only prose writer\". He followed Nicolae's radical orientation, declaring the French Revolution as the \"triumph of justice, liberty and equality, and a great step toward fraternity\"; he also took up the cause of Pan-Europeanism, arguing for \"one great European republic, as in America.\" Reading up on the events at home, Florescu was indignant about the 1866 coup against \"Domnitor\" Alexandru Ioan Cuza. In his view, Cuza, albeit ruling with an \"authoritarian hand\", was preferable to the foreign-born replacement Carol of Hohenzollern. Passionate about literature, Florescu and his colleague Frédéric Damé set up their own newspaper, \"L'Avenir\" (\"The Future\"), which only put out a few issues.\n\nFlorescu was described by teachers and relatives as a charming but inattentive student, and was once moved to a remedial class, ultimately obtaining his \"baccalauréat\" in August 1868. In October 1872, he graduated from the literature faculty of the University of Rennes. From mid 1873, he returned with his mother to Bucharest, where she became the curator of a retirement home maintained by the Sisters of Charity. Her son debuted in the Romanian press with an overview of history as reflected in Romanian folklore; it was hosted in \"Românul\", published by C. A. Rosetti (July–August 1873). On October 3, Florescu married Rose-Henriette Le Roho d'Alcobia (born 1849), the orphaned scion of an Anglo-French-Portuguese family. According to one account, they did not have any children of their own, but later adopted a boy named Ion. Contrarily, literary historian George Călinescu suggests that Ion was the couple's natural son, \"a direct descendant of Nicolae Bălcescu\".\n\nOn October 5, following an examination performed by historian Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Florescu had obtained a \"provisional\" professorate at the department of world literature within the literature faculty of Iași University. He thus replaced Nicolae Ionescu, who preferred to keep his seat in the Assembly of Deputies. Researcher George Porta suggests that Florescu never actually took hold of his chair, being snubbed by two successive Education Ministers: Christian Tell and Vasile Boerescu. However, his introductory lesson was published in Hasdeu's newspaper, \"Columna lui Traian\", which also hosted Florescu's homage to the retiring poet Grigore Alexandrescu. During his time in Iași, Florescu, supported by physician Anastasie Fătu, also founded and operated an adult high school.\n\nIn April 1874, a conservative coalition that included \"Junimea\" society of Iași formed the national government, with Lascăr Catargiu as Prime Minister. The cabinet had Bonifaciu's cousin, Ion Emanuel Florescu, for a Defense Minister—described by critics as authoritarian in his handling of political opposition. Bonifaciu himself was dismissed immediately by the new Education Minister, \"Junimist\" ideologue Titu Maiorescu, who \"could not stand him.\" In his official report, Maiorescu noted that, although Florescu was an erudite, his peculiar teaching style was driving students away.\n\nThis dispute doubled as an cultural conflict between liberals such as Florescu and \"Junimea\". Florescu spent much of his time in polemics with the minister, and also with the \"Junimist\" poet Mihail Eminescu. The latter scandal began in January 1876 with Florescu's derisive note in \"Românul\". Here, Florescu attacked \"Junimism\" (and implicitly Eminescu's work) as a \"torrent of little poets\"—although, in the same text, he praised Eminescu's lover Veronica Micle for her own \"beautiful\" verse. Declaring himself dissatisfied with the assonance of \"Junimist\" poetry, Florescu demanded a more thorough literary consonance. As noted later by the critic Perpessicius, this request was \"bizarre\" and \"drunk on prosody\", although Florescu had \"his indisputable merits.\" Perpessicius also proposes that it formed part of a press campaign \"in bad taste\", \"as vociferous as it was impotent\", seeking to undermine \"Junimea\"s steady rise, with Florescu \"in so very many ways, from the pestering to the inept, ready to censor Eminescu's budding oeuvre.\" Florescu's review was immediately challenged by Nicolae Scurtescu, who sent \"Românul\" a letter in which he expressed solidarity with Eminescu, and asked to be struck out from Florescu's list of \"good poets\", suggesting that Florescu had no qualification to compile such lists.\n\nEminescu would also respond later in 1876 with the libel \"Epistolă deschisă homunculului Bonifaciu\" (\"An Open Letter to Bonifaciu the Homunculus\"). Its reference to a mysterious newspaper, \"Pruncul\" (\"The Babe\"), was later identified as a jibe at \"Românul\", whose predecessor was an 1848 sheet, \"Pruncul Român\" (\"The Romanian Infant\"). The \"letter\", written in tones of \"rising anger\", reads:\nCălinescu finds the poem to be a \"vigorous satire\", its reference to \"B. Florescu's 'oakum' brain [...] describing quite well a fibrous arrhythmic state\". By 1880, the \"homunculus\" imagery was rehashed for the early draft of an ample poem, \"Scrisoarea II\", part of which is specifically dedicated to ridiculing Eminescu's detractors. As noted by Perpessicius, Florescu, unlike Rosetti, was never mentioned in the more definitive satire, \"Scrisoarea III\". This, he suggests, may be a sign of his relative insignificance among Eminescu's enemies.\n\nOverall, Potra notes, Florescu was largely unemployed, and pushed to make his living by giving private lessons in French—his students included the two daughters of physician Constantin Istrati and the future dramatist Ioan Bacalbașa. \"Turned proletarian\", he and Rose-Henriette lived in rented rooms at Pasajul Roman. Maiorescu only allowed Florescu to teach an optional \"free\" course at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters. The lessons were a corpus of \"critical modern history\" (published as a textbook in 1875), discussing such topics as progressivism, the \"Ancien Régime\", British constitutionalism, and German nationalism, as well as the genesis of Wallachian boyardom. They were also indirectly supervised from Paris by professor Henri Pigeonneau, who sent Florescu a bibliography. Although Florescu expressed his frustration over lacking oratorical skills, the lectures made him very popular with Bucharesters.\n\nFlorescu's radicalism also brought him into contact with Hristo Botev, instigator of the Bulgarian National Revival, whom Florescu met in Bucharest and perhaps acquainted with the works of Bălcescu. Some controversy did occur locally when Florescu expressed his democratic beliefs in his university lectures, describing boyardom as a bane and congratulating his own family for giving up on privilege. His early work as a polemicist includes two volumes of \"Etiam contra omnes\" (\"Even against All\"), published alongside the brochure \"Una suta de adevĕrurĭ\" (\"A Hundred Truths\"). The latter comprised aphorisms tinged by anti-\"Junimism\", originally appearing in the daily \"Telegraphul de Bucurescĭ\", where he also published essays discussing Étienne de La Boétie's \"Discourse on Voluntary Servitude\".\n\nHe kept a grudge against Maiorescu, and, in 1875 letters for \"Apărătorul Legeĭ\" newspaper, accused others, notably Cezar Bolliac, of behaving \"like Maiorescu\". Despite this, in 1877 Florescu was theater chronicler at the \"Junimea\" daily, \"România Liberă\". His journalism was by then prolific, with articles also taken up in \"Columna lui Traian\" and \"Românul\", and also in liberal papers such as \"Albine și Viespi\", \"Alegătorul\", and \"Revista Contimporană\". Some were encyclopedic overviews, with topics such as Pre-Columbian Mexico (1875) and the settlement of Iceland (1877); others were the first in a series of \"Studiĭ literare\" (\"Studies in Literature\") where he carried on with critiques of prosody. Another contribution was as a translator, where he made local literary history with Edgar Allan Poe's \"Tell-Tale Heart\" in 1875, followed in 1876 by \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\".\n\nAlso in 1875, Florescu involved himself in the dispute between Romania and Austria-Hungary, concerning the Duchy of Bukovina—Romanian-inhabited, but taken by the Austrian Empire following the rearrangement of 1775. His work, published as a brochure co-authored by Vasile Maniu, accused the Austrians of double-dealing and fraud perpetrated against Moldavia and the Ottomans. Such ideas endeared him to the Romanian nationalists in Transylvania, which was also under Austro-Hungarian rule. In that region, Florescu's work was displayed as an important contribution in \"Orientul Latin\", the nationalist, Pan-Latinist, anti-\"Junimist\" review of Ioan Alexandru Lapedatu. Florescu also involved himself in the dispute over Jewish emancipation: with his school friend Damé, he translated into French Hasdeu's \"Histoire de la tolérance religieuse en Roumanie\" (\"History of Religious Tolerance in Romania\").\n\nIn April 1875, with help from liberal agitators, Florescu seized the opportunity to lecture on Bukovina at the Romanian Atheneum. The Catargiu government forbade it and threatened him with arrest, though he eventually found an open venue at Suhr Circus, between Calea Victoriei and Lipscani. Despite his attested incompetence in public speaking, this event attracted a crowd comprising, in some reports, as many as 6,000 nationalists. Shortly after the Suhr Circus incident, Romanian liberal groups formed the National Liberal Party, which became focused on regaining power. For three weeks in April 1876, Florescu's cousin was the conservative Prime Minister of a mainly soldiers' cabinet. Outmaneuvered by the opposition, it fell and was replaced with a National Liberal government, headed by Manolache Costache Epureanu—himself replaced after the June election with Ion Brătianu, supported by the party's radical, or \"Red\", majority.\n\nDuring this episode of liberal triumph an intrigue, Florescu befriended the liberal poet Alexandru Macedonski, who sympathized with him in his conflict with Maiorescu. Macedonski wrote a poem denouncing Maiorescu's \"scholarly tribe\" and Florescu's 1874 sacking. Between March and June, Florescu published his own newspaper, the republican and anti-conservative \"Stindardul\" (\"The Flag\"), alongside Macedonski and dramatist Pantazi Ghica; however, Macedonski soon quit the enterprise. As a \"Red\", Florescu tried but failed to present himself as a candidate in Ilfov County: in primaries, his colleagues preferred Eugeniu Stătescu over him; in June 1876, he withdrew from \"Stindardul\", declaring himself exhausted by the elections and by his regular work, the \"five hours of daily tutoring\". As noted by memoirist Constantin Bacalbașa, both Florescu and Macedonski had political ambitions and were very popular in liberal circles, but they were also \"transient heroes, the sort that go down with their ephemeral wave.\"\n\nIn July 1876, minister Gheorghe Chițu ruled Florescu's 1873 appointment valid, but only assigned him to a history-and-French teacher's position at Saint Sava High School. According to the satirical gazette \"Ghimpele\", Florescu, \"erstwhile a communist, yesterday a liberal\", taught his pupils extravagant and inaccurate lessons in history. It also alleged that he skipped classes in order to promote the magazine \"Nuvelistul\", on which he also worked as a writer.\n\nIn 1877–1878, the Romanian War of Independence (or more specifically, Romania's contribution to the Russo-Turkish War) opened the way for the country's evolution into a Kingdom of Romania (1880). Although independence occurred under a National Liberal mandate, Bonifaciu's cousin is widely credited with having helped modernize the Romanian Land Forces and getting them battle-ready. Bonifaciu also contributed, on the humanitarian side, publishing the collection \"Quelques vers\", which specified that it collected money \"au profit des blessés\" (\"to help the wounded\").\n\nMeanwhile, Florescu saw himself as fit to occupy the vacated French-language chair at Bucharest University. However, this was converted into a Romance studies chair by government order, then assigned to Gian Luigi Frollo—the enduring perception was that Brătianu was clamping down on French influence, for fear of upsetting Germany. Florescu tried but failed to obtain a professorship in psychology and aesthetics at Bucharest University, and narrowly lost the race for the Romance chair. From January 1880, with Macedonski and Th. M. Stoenescu, Florescu edited a cultural review, \"Literatorul\", where he published notes on the Franco-Prussian War and his new prose poetry, the \"watercolors\" and \"sanguines\". The embryo of a local Symbolist movement, \"Literatorul\" soon became noted for its prolonged polemic with Eminescu, which was carried by both Macedonski and Florescu. The latter also censured Macedonski's estranged friend, Duiliu Zamfirescu, who defected to \"Junimea\". When he later alleged that this was for material gain, Zamfirescu simply dismissed him as a \"zevzec\" (\"nitwit\").\n\nFlorescu himself eventually withdrew from the enterprise after a mysterious quarrel with Macedonski, who then accused him, also in \"Literatorul\", of having squandered public money with his teaching. However, according to scholar Șerban Cioculescu, Florescu and Stonescu, together with poet-actor Mircea Demetriade—all three \"faint and subdued figures\"—, remained the last Macedonski loyalists as the latter fell into disgrace. Similarly, critic Adrian Marino notes that, while Macedonski's program was \"constructive, evolved and receptive of the most fecund modern orientations\", its main adherents, Florescu included, were \"insignificant [and] obscure\".\n\nHis own monthly, \"Portofoliul Român\" (\"The Romanian Portfolio\"), appeared between March 1881 and June 1882, hosting poetry by Demetriade and Florescu's \"watercolors\", as well as his various historical essays—much praised by the Romanophile Frenchman Abdolonyme Ubicini. In a note published therein, he revealed that \"Portofoliul\" only existed because of Petru Grădișteanu, whose recent law on debt relief had spared Florescu from his creditors. This news was reviewed with amusement in \"Junimea\"s \"Convorbiri Literare\", which remarked that literature \"owes so much to Mr. Grădișteanu\". The same magazine derided Florescu's attempt to summarize philosophically the history of Austria on five pages: \"The bigger the country, the shorter its philosophy.\" Additionally, Florescu announced that he was working on a fragmentary treatise on the historiosophy of the Balkans, seen by him as a single cultural and racial space. His other contributions included a rhyming obituary to painter Ion Andreescu, taken up in \"Binele Public\" newspaper and then carved on Andreescu's tombstone.\n\nIn 1884, the Florescus moved out of Pasajul Roman and to a small house on Calea Victoriei, with Bonifaciu founding a literary serial, \"Biblioteca Omuluĭ de Gust\" (\"The Library of Tasteful Men\"), where he issued the collected poems of Alexandru Depărățeanu. The year also witnessed a release of his collected historical essays, as \"Memento de istorie universală sau Istoria în tablourĭ\" (\"World History Memento or, History in Scenes\"); his translation of Musset's play \"Never Swear That You Be Not Forsworn\"; and his critical edition of Count Buffon's \"Discours sur le style\". In August of the following year, \"Românul\" had a row with the National Liberal Party, causing Florescu to side with the former. The core issue was again nationalism: Prime Minister Brătianu gave in to Austro-Hungarian demands, and expelled a group of Transylvanians, including Nicolae Ciurcu, publisher of \"L'Indépendance Roumaine\". When \"Românul\" protested and was raided by police, Florescu showed up to express solidarity, one of several National Liberals to do so—the others were Grădișteanu, Dimitrie Gianni, and George D. Pallade. In 1886, his essay on the 1848 revolution was taken up by the same \"L'Indépendance Roumaine\".\n\nBy then, the historian lived a bohemian life, and was a regular at Fialcovsky Coffeehouse, where he appeared \"jocular and always absent minded\". According to the recollections of Mariu Theodorian-Carada, although \"Boniface Florescu\" and Demetriade made efforts to keep it alive, by 1886 \"Fialkovsky was dwindling\". Potra notes that Florescu was memorable as a Bucharest \"type\", \"with his quite disheveled appearance, his paddling, slow and measured stride, and above all with his way of life\". Reportedly, he always wore just one galosh, or sometimes one of his wife's boots, and his suits were covered in ink blots. Gheorghe Gh. Longinescu, who was schooled at Saint Sava, recalls that his teacher had an unusual, crooked, stride, which matched his handwriting. An unnamed Saint Sava alumnus recalled in 1926: \"Just about every day, he would walk the streets reading from a newspaper or a book, and, since he was shortsighted, he kept [it] very close to his eyes, and so he bumped into streetlights or street corners, after which he would present his excuses.\"\n\nThe writer Maica Smara, who shared a home with Bonifaciu, Henriette-Rose, and sculptor Ion Georgescu in the 1880s, recalls that they \"never once opened a window\", and notes: \"hoopoes did better housecleaning than them.\" Physician Constantin Dimitrescu-Severeanu, who visited his home, records that Bonifaciu and wife slept on a pile of hay, and that Florescu looked like \"he never washed his face more than thrice a year.\" Florescu was a heavy drinker and smoker, and, according to another one-time student, Constantin Kirițescu, only seemed at ease in coffeehouses and bars; he despised Saint Sava and, with time, only showed up for that work because it paid a salary. According to Dr. Severeanu, he borrowed money from both friends and students, promising that they were for him to write a new book. Longinescu additionally claims that Florescu was \"unusually cultured, but lacked common sense\", and so the victim of \"countless student pranks\". Among the students who remained loyal to Florescu was the poet Iuliu Cezar Săvescu, who, in 1886, also became a member of Macedonski's circle.\n\nWhile his picturesque demeanor was laughed at, Florescu's erudition was acclaimed, in particular concerning his passionate Saint Sava lessons about 18th-century French literature, which was regarded as his main field of expertise. The courses were published in several installments, from 1887 to 1893, followed by the book edition of \"Studiĭ literare\". In April 1888, Macedonski and Florescu took over management of \"România Literară\" review from D. Teleor; it survived until 1889. Also in 1889, Florescu translated Catulle Mendès' \"Imagerie parisienne\", adding his own \"Romanian Sanguines\", and returned to the University of Bucharest with another \"free\" course, this time on French literature. By then, he had joined several members of the \"Literatorul\" school who were migrating toward \"Revista Nouă\", put out by Hasdeu and featuring authors disliked by Macedonski. Interested in spiritism, from about 1890 Florescu also attended Hasdeu's \"séances\", alongside Bishop Ghenadie, George Ionescu-Gion, and Ioan S. Nenițescu; Theodor Speranția acted as medium.\n\nIn 1892, he produced a volume of his collected poetry, as \"Ritmurĭ și rime\" (\"Rhythms and Rhymes\"). Its theoretical notes on prosody relaunched the attack on Eminescu, depicting him and the younger Alexandru Vlahuță as \"enemies of rhythm and rhyme\"; of the latter two, he favored rhythm, and translated a fragment from Victor Hugo in blank verse, to prove his point. The book also featured his renditions of poems by: Henri Auguste Barbier, Mellin de Saint-Gelais, Charles Baudelaire, Pierre de Ronsard, Alfred de Musset, Clément Marot, François Rabelais, Isaac de Benserade, Paul Scarron, Alexandre Soutzo, Ponce Lebrun, and Charles Rivière Dufresny. His work of the period also covered selections from other classics and moderns of French literature: Molière, Voltaire, Rodolphe Töpffer, Alexandre Dumas, Edgar Quinet, George Sand, Henri Murger, Paul Armand Silvestre, Théodore de Banville, and José-Maria de Heredia; more exotically, he also rendered into Romanian works by Walter Scott and Fernán Caballero, as well as samples of Malagasy and Indian poetry. Also publishing in Giurgiu an anthology of 17th-century poetry in French, he moved house closer to Saint Sava in 1891, at a new address on Soarelui Street, which also became the editorial offices of his new gazette. Called \"Dumineca\" (\"The Sunday\"), and published to February 1891, it was co-edited by Demetriade and Săvescu, and possibly managed by the latter.\n\nA while after, Florescu's cousin, a prominent figure in the Liberal Conservative Party, briefly served as Prime Minister. Reportedly, Bonifaciu had hopes that Ion Emanuel would reestablish the Bucharest French-language chair and assign him to it, but the relevant minister, G. Dem. Teodorescu, vetoed any such move. The premier was eventually sidelined from within the party by Catargiu, and lost a vote of no confidence, ushering in the February 1892 elections; he died in Paris in May 1893. Around that time, Bonifaciu had begun writing a biography of his father, in French; unpublished, it was later preserved by the Bălcescu Memorial Museum. With Demetriade, he became a regular contributor to Săvescu's own literary magazine, launched in 1893 as \"Liga Literară\". Florescu was also a regular at Grigore Tocilescu's scientific journal, \"Revista pentru Istorie, Arheologie și Filologie\". Tocilescu, his cousin thrice removed, allowed him to publish his notes on Bălcescu's complex mediation between the Hungarians and Romanians of Transylvania.\n\nHis own hard-line stance on the Transylvanian issue, expressed during the \"Transylvanian Memorandum\" incident of 1892, alienated him further from both dominant parties. By November 1893, he was editing a newspaper called \"Irredenta Română\" (\"The Romanian Irredenta\"), his contribution there derided by the National Liberal Dimitrie Sturdza. Sturdza argued that Florescu's goal of annexing Transylvania to the Romanian kingdom was unrealistic; he also declared that such radicalism was only serving Romania's enemies, with Florescu and his colleagues \"either sold out or very incompetent and stupid.\" Joining the nonpartisan Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians, Florescu was a direct contributor to its irredentist propaganda, working alongside the Italian sympathizer Roberto Fava. He also helped the young nationalist liberal, Take Ionescu, polishing his letters of protest against Austria-Hungary, written in French. As Ionescu recalled decades later: \"Bonifaciu was a veritable savant, but had endured the unrepentant bohemian. He only worked when we pressed him to, with us looking over his shoulder.\"\n\nDuring this stage of his life, Florescu became close friends with Georges Bibesco, French-speaking son of Prince Gheorghe Bibescu (whom his father and uncles had deposed in 1848). He translated Bibesco's defensive biography of his father, which ran at over 1200 pages in the printed edition of 1893–1894. As he noted in a dedication to Bibesco, he considered him a friend through their shared Francophilia, but nonetheless a political adversary. Bibesco then enlisted Florescu's services in clearing Prince Gheorghe of the allegations that he intended to concede all of Wallachia's mining industry to Russian venture capitalists. Florescu also worked with Theodor Assan and A. Dobrovici on a history of the United Principalities, published as \"Unirea Română\" (\"The Romanian Unification\"), and translated Bibesco's tract on the history of Wallachia and Moldavia under \"Regulamentul Organic\".\n\nAlso in 1894, Florescu was an unsuccessful candidate for the vacated chair of medieval and modern history at Bucharest University—a position ultimately taken up by Nicolae Iorga in 1895. According to historian Lucian Nastasă, his \"permanent failure\" to obtain academic credentials had an explanation \"as plain as they get: his attitude was openly and actively anti-\"Junimist\".\" Reflecting back on the period in 1939, Iorga himself noted: \"Shame that in this literary world of ours, guided by groups and interests, that poor man never heard a good word for that consuming labor of his and for his true talent, inherited from his father.\"\n\nFlorescu gathered his \"Literatorul\" pieces as \"Aquarele și poeziĭ în proză\" (\"Watercolors and Prose Poems\"), with contributions by Demetriade and a C. Drăgulinescu, and with samples from Murger. His work for 1894 additionally included the first volume of a French–Romanian dictionary (comprising 6 volumes in all), followed in 1895 by an overview of French lyrical poetry \"between the 10th and 20th centuries\". In his final years, Florescu made one more attempt at founding a review—the 1894 weekly \"Dacia Viitoare\" (\"Future Dacia\")—and contributed an overview of the Horea–Cloșca rebellion to the Symbolist journal \"Revista Orientală\".\n\nFlorescu eventually resigned from Saint Sava, but continued to teach history and French at Mihai Viteazul High School, at the military high school, and at the Saint Nephon seminary. His late experiments in wisdom poetry appeared in the Transylvanian \"Vatra\". For a while director of a new magazine, \"Țara Literară\" (\"The Literary Country\"), he was also a contributor to Ion Livescu's \"Revista Theatrelor\", aimed at the community of actors and theater aficionados. Livescu saw him as one of the great critics in the field, equal to Ionescu-Gion and Grigore Ventura. In 1896, with Săvescu, Florescu began translating from a history of Albanian literature (in Italian, by Alberto Straticò). By then, Florescu had published over 200 books, comprising his own works alongside translations, and had had his own verse anthologized by poet Radu D. Rosetti (in \"Cartea Dragosteĭ\", 1896).\n\nBefore August 1899, Florescu's work was hampered by an illness, later diagnosed as ventricular hypertrophy; he was living with his family in a small house on Speranței Street, north of Colțea Hospital. Luxița Florescu died in October of that year, aged 83, and Bonifaciu only two months later, on December 18. Demetriade unexpectedly dropped by on a visit just after his friend's death, recalling: \"he had woken up more joyful than ever. Always one to enjoy a pun, he asked his wife, whose name was Rose, to hand him a rose that had been left in some glass. Just after Madam Florescu handed him that flower, the soul of this man, always a poet, went out with the perfume of the rose.\" A brief obituary in \"Literatorul\" credited him as someone \"illustrious but unhappy\", who \"stood up to the intellectual degeneracy into which our country was continuously pushed.\" He was buried in the family crypt at Țigănești Monastery, next to his mother, with a funeral ceremony attended by the Bucharest aristocracy and the Saint Sava students. The grave has since been lost during extensive repair work on the monastery grounds.\n\nFlorescu was survived by both his wife and his son. In 1900, Henriette-Rose took a small pension from the state, awarded to her by a review committee which included Costache Bălcescu. She lived for 28 more years, to January 1928. Ion, an officer in the Romanian Land Forces, married in February 1910 Elena Kalinderu, a relative of agriculturist and art collector Ioan Kalinderu. He had two children of his own: Mircea Ioan (born 1912, killed in a car accident in 1929), and judge Ion \"Nelu\" Florescu, who emigrated to Brazil and was still alive in 1941.\n\nBonifaciu Florescu's work and family history gained more exposure after the August 1944 coup and during early Romanian communism, when left-wing ideologies turned Bălcescu into their hero. At the time, Potra notes, the Florescus came to accept Bonifaciu's paternity, published secret notes and rare photographs, and even helped Camil Petrescu write his romanticized biography of the revolutionary. In the 1950s, Soviet historiography proposed that Florescu was secretly a Communard, and that he supported Sergey Nechayev, the Russian revolutionist, providing him with his own passport. The claim was reviewed with skepticism by the Romanian scholar Georges Haupt, who noted that \"Florescu\" was actually a certain N. F. Melediu. As noted in the 1980s by Potra, the real Florescu had been causally forgotten, despite being both Bălcescu's heir and, on his own, \"a distinguished scholar, a true \"encyclopédiste\".\"\n\nGeorge Călinescu saw Florescu as a characteristic product of the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, his didactic art \"decent\" but \"convoluted and timid, overwhelmed by ideas of classicism\". His lyrical poetry respects all the criteria that he wanted to impose on Eminescu; nonetheless, critics argue, it is not ungraceful, nor devoid of sentiment. However, according to Potra, his 1883 epitaph for Ion Andreescu is \"very dull, in pointless verses which tell us nothing about the value of our great painter.\" As seen by comparatist Marin Bucur, Florescu's work in verse was already culturally irrelevant by 1875.\n\nAs a literary innovator directly inspired by Catulle Mendès, Florescu tied to popularize a genre prose poetry \"from life\", the so-called \"watercolors\" or \"sanguines\". According to Adrian Marino, these were among the more adequate and modern samples of \"Literatorul\" prose—alongside those by Săvescu, Constantin Cantilli, and D. Teleor; the rest were \"tendentious, abstract\", and \"dependent\" on Macedonski's verdicts. Received with sarcasm by other critics, they include fragments about blind and insane children, or about children sleeping in each other's arms, and, as comparatist Mihai Zamfir argues, were \"experiments [...] pushed into oblivion\" by the more mature Symbolist prose poetry of Ștefan Petică (ca. 1900). His epistolary novel, \"Etiam contra omnes\", depicts the worldview of \"Recaredo\", a Peruvian spiritist and Pan-Latinist intellectual. It impressed a young Take Ionescu, who found Recaredo to be the perfect human, and his racial ideology a symbol of Romania's own discords with her various neighbors. As Florescu informed his readers, these were \"pages written at a time when only literature was my comfort\"—words expressing, again, his enmity for \"Junimea\". The novel, Ionescu believed, had a mission to \"instill Romanianism\", and also to cultivate solidarity between Romanians and Greeks.\n\nFlorescu also earned some attention as a literary essayist, popularizer, and critic—much inspired by four scholars, whom he deemed the elite of French literature: Abel-François Villemain, Sainte-Beuve, Hippolyte Taine, and Emile Hennequin. Călinescu stresses that Florescu's opening lesson of 1873 was \"a lamentable rigmarole that addressed the issue of historical objectivity\". Later tracts were \"wordy, without proper ranking of values\". According to Bucur, Florescu was an \"amateur\", \"textbook cultivated\", \"a cultural journalist enthusiastic about beauty and culture, taking pains not to fatigue a public that cannot sustain the effort.\" According to Iorga, his exposition was \"always lively, not without fortunate characterizations\"—such as when Florescu depicted Danton as a \"poor man's Mirabeau\". Overall, however, Iorga referred to Florescu as a \"bizarre\" or \"weird\" author. Similarly, the anti-Symbolist Ilarie Chendi viewed Florescu as \"cultured, but ill-regulated\".\n\nAlthough marginally supportive of Symbolism, Florescu was noticeably unimpressed by its herald Baudelaire, and, Bucur writes, \"understood nothing from Mallarmé and Verlaine\". Chendi saw Florescu as the instigator of Romania's Decadent movement, which revolved around a cult for Baudelaire; however, he believed that Florescu's particular contribution was reviving another cult, that of romantic poets: Ion Heliade Rădulescu, Dimitrie Bolintineanu, and Alexandru Depărățeanu, whom Florescu rated \"above Eminescu\". In 1878, he also described a non-Symbolist poet, Ronetti Roman, as a master, Romania's answer to Musset and Heinrich Heine. Some reviewers attribute Macedonski's affection for Florescu to the latter's \"attachment to French culture\" or, more precisely, to Macedonski's snobbery: \"A writer turned proletarian and with relations all across the world, who descended from Michael the Brave, from N. Bălcescu, and from some of the leading princely families, with relatives in Portugal, England and India—that catered to Macedonski's preferences.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "573156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=573156", "title": "Bullionism", "text": "Bullionism\n\nBullionism is an economic theory that defines wealth by the amount of precious metals owned. Bullionism is an early or primitive form of mercantilism. It was derived, in the 16th century, from the observation that the English state, because of its large trade surplus, possessed large amounts of gold and silver—bullion—despite the fact that there was no mining of precious metals in England.\n\nThomas Milles (1550–1627) and others recommended that England increase exports to create a trade surplus, convert the surplus into precious metals, and hinder the drain of money and precious metal to other countries. England did restrict exportation of money or precious metals around 1600, but Milles wanted to return to using staple ports to force merchants from abroad to use their assets to buy English goods and prevent them from transferring gold or silver from England homewards. Milles's opinions, however, were not widely valued. One of his contemporaries wrote, \"Milles was so much out of step with the time that his pamphlets had little influence.\"\n\nGerard de Malynes (1586–1641), another bullionist, published a book called \"A Treatise of the Canker of England's Common Wealth\", that asserted that the exchange of foreign currency had been a trade of value rather than exchanging the weight of metals. Therefore, the unfair exchanging of precious metals by bankers and money changers would cause a deficit in the English balance of trade. To ban the flow of exchange rates, he demanded the strict fixing of exchange rates for coins, only by the concentration of precious metals and weights, and for strict regulation and monitoring of foreign trade. He failed, however, to convince his contemporaries “...that the cambists were responsible for gold outflow or to elicit enthusiasm for a monopoly sale of exchange, par pro pari, by the royal exchanger.\" He did succeed in stirring up one of the first economic controversies, and Edward Misselden opposed him in 1623 in his book \"The Circle of Commerce: Or, the Balance of Trade\".\n\n"}
{"id": "53678400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53678400", "title": "Burning of the Burning Embers pub", "text": "Burning of the Burning Embers pub\n\nThe Burning of the Burning Embers pub was an early military operation carried out by the Provisional IRA's Belfast Brigade (PIRA). The Burning Embers was used as a base by the Official IRA (OIRA), the Provisional IRA also hoped to burn down the Cracked Cup which was another pub owned by the OIRA along the Falls Road on Leeson Street but the OIRA got information that the PIRA was coming and a gun battle broke out.\n\nTensions had been high between the OIRA and PIRA after the two factions split in December 1969. This was the third major split in the IRA since it became the legitimate army of the Irish Republic state in 1920.\nIn April 1970 the PIRA tried to kill OIRA Belfast Brigade Commanding Officer Billy McMillen but he survived his injuries.\nAfter the Falls Curfew relations turned even more sour. The Officials accused the Provisionals of tricking them into a fight they could not win and then leaving them to fight alone, resulting in the loss of much of their weaponry and several of their men being captured & wounded. Over the following months each organization carried out beatings of each other's members, the majority of these beatings were carried out by the OIRA as they were still the larger group at the time. \nThe OIRA was also angry that the PIRA had started raiding OIRA arms dumps for weapons.\n\nThe OIRA had the focused nearly all of their Volunteers inside the Lower Falls area of Belfast as in that area as both the OIRA and PIRA knew it was a key location. Most of those had been there before the outbreak of the Battle of the Bogside & Northern Ireland riots in 1969 which started the conflict. The Provisional IRA was small in the area but was young and very determined to make a name for themselves, especially D-Company headed by Brendan Hughes's cousin Charlie Hughes, a well respected and liked Voluteer. The mindset was who ever controlled the Lower Falls controlled Belfast and the PIRA was determined to wrestle power away from the OIRA or \"Sticks\" as the PIRA called them.\n\nTensions increased even more when the OIRA \"arrested\" and beat Paddy McDermott the QM (Quartermaster) of the PIRA Belfast Brigade D-Company for looking through their arms dumps and then badly beat him. But the PIRA now had controlled the arms dump that McDermott was beaten for.\nIn retaliation for the PIRA controlling the arms dumps, in late 1970, they shot the brother of Joe Cahill, Tom Cahill. They shot him six times but he survived the shooting.\n\nThe final straw came in early 1971 when PIRA Volunteer Alec Crowe had been \"arrested\" by the OIRA and taken to their drinking den the Cracked Cup on Balkan Street. Brendan Hughes was in a house opposite the Cracked Cup and seen Alec Crowe being forced out of the car and dragged into the pub. Brendan then immediately ran around to his cousin and O/C Charlie Hughes and told him what he saw. Charlie told Brendan to mobilise the rest of the Volunteers in the PIRA Belfast Brigade, open the arms dump & to be on standby. Charlie mobilised the Volunteers into one group sent a squad to burn down two OIRA clubs, the Cracked Cup and the Burning Embers. The squad arrived at the Burning Embers first & when they got inside they saw people were having a celebration for Paddy Devlin MP and OIRA Comnmander Jim Sullivan was also there at the same time. Brendan Hughes ordered them to move first but they wouldn't budge, so Charlie ordered them to pour petrol around the club and put a match to it, people then started to move once they the flames in the clubs & soon the whole building was ablaze.\n\nTheir next target was the Cracked Cup on Leeson street which is where the PIRA Volunteers headed to next, but the Official IRA got information passed on to them that a PIRA unit was coming to Leeson street to burn another club but as soon as the PIRA Volunteers got to McDonnell Street (near Leeson Street) they were ambushed by OIRA Volunteers and two of the PIRA's men Frank Gillen and Dipper Dempsey were shot and injured. A gun battle ensued around McDonnell and Leeson street which lasted for about twenty-five minutes. According to Brendan Hughes the British Army drove past the gun battle at the bottom of Leeson Street and did not bother intervening in the gun battle between the PIRA & OIRA Volunteers. Out numbered & out gunned orders came for the PIRA Volunteers to pull back. This ended hostilities for the day.\n\nThe OIRA took revenge for the burning of their main HQ when they shot PIRA Commander Chalie Hughes. He was shot coming out of a house in Leeson Street along with Billy McKee and Proinsias MacAirt, a OIRA Volunteer opened up with a Thompson submachine gun killing Hughes instantly. It's been speculated Joe McCann was the shooter. The backlash against the OIRA from the Nationalist community was to do large damage to the OIRA, Hughes was a well liked, respected & a devout Catholic, who helped many local people during the Falls Curfew & at other times the Lower Falls was attacked. Many new young recruits started joining the PIRA in the wake of Huges's killing and before long the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade was in charge of the Lower Falls & most of Nationalist Belfast. A ceasefire was soon arranged between the OIRA and PIRA after the death of Charlie Hughes and Brendan Hughes, Charlie's cousin took over command of D-Company.\nWhen interviewed for Boston College for research on the conflict Brendan Hughes had the following to say on the conflict with the Official IRA.\n\n\"[The Officials] arrested a man called Alec Crowe from the Ballymurphyarea and they brought him to the drinking club in Leeson Street. He was brought to the Cracked Cup and I was in a house directly facing, in Eileen Hickey’s house, and saw Alec being taken out of a car and trailed in. I left the house, went round to Charlie’s\nhouse, my cousin, told him what I’d seen. Charlie ordered me then to mobilise the rest of the Volunteers, open up the dump and be on standby in his house. I got them together, got the weapons out, a couple of .303s, two m1 carbines, three revolvers, and a few hand grenades. Charlie went up to Kane Street, up to Frank Card’s house, MacAirt as we called him, and I sat awaiting instructions . . . an hour, hour and a half later, Charlie came back and we were mobilised into one group. A squad was sent down from Andersons - town. They moved into a house in Balkan Street and we were under orders to burn down the two clubs. By this stage, Alec Crowe had\nbeen released by the Sticks* [but he] had been badly beaten, pistolwhipped, and thrown out. After that – a silly, silly, silly operation it was – we moved out of Charlie’s house, straight across the street, no more than thirty yards and took over the Burning Embers. Charlie sent me upstairs to empty the room. I went up and produced my weapon, a .45, and told them to get out but they wouldn’t move, so I fired a couple of shots into the air. At the time there was a party in the bar for Paddy Devlin who was an MP at Stormont.† They were celebrating and he was sitting at the bar with Jimmy Sullivan. So I went down and told Charlie that they wouldn’t move. We had cans of petrol and Charlie gave the order ‘burn it’. So the petrol was laid and the match put to it. And only then did they start moving out. Paddy Devlin was one of the first out; his car was sitting outside, and he drove off. He arrived back in Leeson Street later, I believe, with weapons. So, the Burning Embers was burning. We then assembled outside and moved round along Balkan Street to the\nCracked Cup to burn that as well. A group of us went up Cyprus Street, through Varna Gap, heading down into Leeson Street. Another group came along McDonnell Street in a pincer movement\n\nAs soon as we got to McDonnell Street we were opened up on. Two men [were] shot: Frank Gillen and Dipper Dempsey. A gun battle ensued [and] went on for twenty, twenty-five minutes, us firing at the Cracked Cup. We never got burning the Cracked Cup, but I remember lying at the corner of McDonnell Street firing up at the\nCracked Cup and . . . the British Army driving past the bottom of Leeson Street. They never came into the area; they let us just shoot it out. Eventually we were ordered to pull back.\"\n\nThe Official IRA who were already being criticised for the killing of Charlie Hughes seen their support drop even more after the 1972 Aldershot Bombing which killed seven civilians, they also seen their support fade in Derry as well after they shot dead a popular local off duty Catholic British soldier William Best (19) who was home on leave in Williams Street in May 1972. Shortly after the death of Best the group called a ceasefire.\n\nA feud broke out again between the two Republican groups which began on Wednesday 29 October 1975 in a bid by the Provisional IRA to wipe the Official IRA out. Eleven people were to die in this feud which was to last until November.\nBoth sides suffered heavy casualties but the PIRA came out of the feud in better shape, the OIRA was severely weakened from the feud thanks as well to a feud with the Irish National Liberation Army earlier during the year. Former Official IRA Belfast Brigade Commander Billy McMillen was killed in the feud and Sean Garland was badly injured by the INLA.\n\n\n"}

His career alternated between periods of academic historical research and diplomatic postings; the most prominent of the latter were League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig (1937–39) and President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (1945–48).\n\nBurckhardt was born in Basel to Carl Christoph Burckhardt, a member of the patrician Burckhardt family, and attended gymnasium in Basel and Glarisegg (in Steckborn). He subsequently studied at the universities of Basel, Zürich, Munich, and Göttingen, being particularly influenced by professors Ernst Gagliardi and Heinrich Wölfflin.\n\nHe gained his first diplomatic experience in the Swiss legation in Austria from 1918 to 1922, a chaotic period following the collapse of Austria-Hungary. While there, he became acquainted with Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Burckhardt earned his doctorate in 1922, and then accepted an appointment with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which posted him to Asia Minor, where he assisted in the resettlement of Greeks expelled from Turkey following Greece's 1922 defeat.\n\nHe subsequently returned to Switzerland, where he married Elisabeth de Reynold (a daughter of Gonzague de Reynold) and pursued an academic career. He was appointed Privatdozent at the University of Zurich in 1927, and in 1929 was appointed extraordinary professor of contemporary history. From 1932 to 1937 he was ordinary professor at the recently created Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva. While there, he published in 1935 the first volume of his comprehensive biography of Cardinal Richelieu, which would eventually be completed by the publication of the 4th volume in 1967.\n\nHe returned to a diplomatic career in 1937, serving as the final League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig from 1937 to 1939. In that position, he aimed to maintain the international status of Danzig guaranteed by the League of Nations, which brought him into contact with a number of prominent Nazis as he attempted to stave off increasing German demands. The mission eventually ended unsuccessfully with the invasion of Poland and German annexation of Danzig.\n\nFollowing this period as High Commissioner, he returned to his professorship in Geneva for the rest of World War II (1939–1945). While in that position, he was also active in a leading role in the ICRC, traveling to Germany several times to negotiate for better treatment of civilians and prisoners, in part using the contacts gained during his two years as High Commissioner in Danzig.\n\nAfter the war, he became President of the ICRC, serving from 1945 to 1948. Organizationally, he increased the integration of the international Red Cross institutions and the national Red Cross Societies. Politically, his term was controversial as he maintained the ICRC's existing policy of strict neutrality in international disputes, which led to the ICRC refusing to officially condemn the Nazis as their atrocities came to light. His strong anti-Communism even led to him considering Nazism the lesser evil. During this period, he simultaneously served from 1945 to 1949 as the Swiss envoy in Paris.\n\nBurckhardt was \"a close friend and admirer of Hitler\" and was kept informed of the Final Solution as early as 1941. Under his leadership, the ICRC \"served as a tool of Nazi extermination policy\", according to Israeli historian Livia Rothkirchen. The Red Cross' stance during the war did not fully come to light until it opened its archives from the period in 1994.\n\nAfter 1949, he returned to his academic career, publishing a number of books on history over the next several decades. In 1954 he was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. He died in 1974 in Vinzel. His wife died in 1989.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kranzler (May 19, 1930 – November 29, 2007) was an American professor of library science at Queensborough Community College, New York, who specialized in the study of the rescue of Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nKranzler was the author of several books on the topic, including \"Thy Brothers' Blood: The Orthodox Jewish Response During the Holocaust\" (1987) and \"The Man Who Stopped the Trains to Auschwitz: George Mantello, El Salvador, and Switzerland's Finest Hour\" (2000).\n\nKranzler was born in Germany, one of seven children, to Yerachmiel and Chana Kranzler of Wurzburg. His family emigrated to the United States in 1937 to avoid Nazi persecution, and he was raised in Brooklyn, New York. In 1953 he obtained his BA from Brooklyn College, followed by an MA in 1958, also from Brooklyn, and an MLS degree in 1957 from Columbia University.\n\nIn 1971 Kranzler was awarded a doctorate by Yeshiva University, for a thesis entitled \"The History of the Jewish Refugee Community of Shanghai: 1938–1945\", the result of a seven-year study of the 17,000 Jews who fled to Shanghai from Nazi Germany. The manuscript was published by Yeshiva University Press in 1976 as \"Japanese, Nazis & Jews: The Jewish Refugee Community of Shanghai, 1938–1945\". Reviewing the book for the \"The American Historical Review\", Leona S. Forman called it a \"painstaking documentation of a vignette in Jewish history\".\n\nAfter working as a school librarian, Kranzler joined the faculty of Queensborough Community College (QCC) of the City University of New York in 1969, and was a professor in the library department until his retirement in 1988. He was one of the founders and the first director of QCC's Holocaust Resource Center and Archives.\n\nHe served as scholar-in-residence in numerous congregations, college campuses, and centers, including the Spanish-Portuguese Synagogue (under Rabbi Marc D. Angel) in Manhattan; Kodima Synagogue in Springfield, Massachusetts (under his brother-in-law Rabbi Alex Weisfogel); and the Ohio State University Holocaust Center (under Professor Saul S. Friedman). From October 2002 to January 2003, Kranzler was a Baron Friedrich Carl von Oppenheim Research Fellow for the Study of Racism, Antisemitism, and the Holocaust at Yad Vashem's International Institute for Holocaust Research; the title of his research project was \"A Comparative Study on the Worldwide Rescue Effort by Orthodox Jewry During the Holocaust Within the Context of Rescue in General\".\n\nKranzler became a leading historian on the subject of aiding the Jews during the Holocaust, and was among the first to document the efforts of Orthodox Jewish organizations, such as the Vaad Ha-hatzala and Agudath Israel. Historian Alex Grobman referred to him as \"the pioneer of research on Orthodox Jewry during the war.\" Kranzler's book \"Solomon Schonfeld: His Page in History\", co-authored with Gertrude Hirschler, and his later \"Thy Brother's Blood\" (1987) were the first to focus on this area. He wrote a paper, \"Orthodox Ends, UnOrthodox Means\", for \"American Jewry during the Holocaust\" (1983), a report organized by the American Jewish Commission, led by Arthur J. Goldberg.\n\nKranzler lectured on the subject in America, Israel, Europe and the Far East. He interviewed and recorded over a thousand people, including some of the major Jewish rescuers, such as Hillel Kook (also known as Peter Bergson), George Mantello, Rabbi Solomon Schonfeld, and close family and associates of rescuers no longer alive, including Rabbi Michael Ber Weissmandl and Recha Sternbuch. He established a research archive of about a million pages and interviews (mostly audio) at his Brooklyn home, later housed at Yad Vashem. By 1978 the archive held over 10,000 documents on Jewish residents of Shanghai.\n\nIn his book \"Thy Brother's Blood: The Orthodox Jewish Response During the Holocaust\" (1987), Kranzler argued that more lives could have been saved if American-Jewish leaders had lent more support to efforts in Europe to halt the deportations, including the attempts, in Slovakia and Hungary, to bribe the SS. Criticizing the book's factual accuracy, Efraim Zuroff described it as \"an extremely one-sided polemic\" and \"a popular invective of limited scholarly value\". In the view of historian Robert Moses Shapiro, the book's defects, particularly its bitter tone and poor editing, undermined its \"important and gripping story\".\n\nThe mid-1944 grassroots protests in Switzerland to publicize the Vrba–Wetzler report, including the Swiss press campaign led by George Mantello, was the subject of Kranzler's book \"The Man Who Stopped the Trains to Auschwitz\" (2000), which had a foreword by Joe Lieberman. The Vrba–Wetzler report, written by two Auschwitz escapees, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler, and distributed by, among others, the Bratislava Working Group, provided a detailed account of the mass murder taking place inside the Auschwitz concentration camp. Kranzler was convinced that Mantello's campaign to publicize the report led to the stopping of the mass transports of Jews from Hungary to Auschwitz in July 1944, and enabled the Raoul Wallenberg mission and other important initiatives in Hungary and elsewhere. The manuscript won the 1998 Egit Prize from the Histadrut for the best manuscript on the Holocaust. \n\nDuring his fellowship with Yad Vashem's International Institute for Holocaust Research in 2002–2003, Kranzler engaged in a research project entitled \"A Comparative Study on the Worldwide Rescue Effort by Orthodox Jewry During the Holocaust Within the Context of Rescue in General.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12616714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12616714", "title": "Delilah L. Beasley", "text": "Delilah L. Beasley\n\nDelilah Leontium Beasley (September 9, 1867 – August 18, 1934), was an American historian, and newspaper columnist for the \"Oakland Tribune\", Oakland, California, US. Beasley becomes the first African-American woman to be published regularly in a major metropolitan newspaper.\n\nAs a writer, Beasley has the distinction of being the first person to have presented written proof of the existence of California black pioneers, in her writings, \"Slavery in California\" (1918) and her classic, \"The Negro Trail-Blazers of California\" (1919), a pioneering work in the field of California black history. Her journalists career spanned more than fifty years, including detailing the racial problems in California and the heroic achievements by Blacks to overcome them, during the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nBeasley was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the oldest of five children in the family of Daniel Beasley, an engineer, and Margaret Harris, a homemaker. After her parents' death while she was still a teenager, Beasley had to find a full-time job to support herself, she pursued a career as a trained masseuse. She began her newspaper career in 1883 writing for a black newspaper the \"Cleveland Gazette\", founded by Harry C. Smith. She wrote briefly about church and social activities. Three years later, she published her first column in the Sunday Cincinnati, Ohio, \"Enquirer\" under the headline \"Mosaics\". Beasley studied journalism under Dan Rudd, a well-known newspaper publisher of the \"Colored Catholic Tribune\" in Cincinnati.\n\nIn 1910, at age 39, Beasley moved to Oakland, California, attending lectures and researching at University of California, Berkeley and writing essays for presentations at local churches. In 1910 the African American population in Oakland was 3,055. The small black population supported a flowering of indigenous institutions and community formation in the 10s and 20s. Among these institutions were various black-owned small businesses, churches, and private social-welfare organizations. In addition, several black newspapers were published in Oakland, including the \"Oakland Sunshine\", which began publication in 1902, publisher William Prince, and the \"Western Outlook\", established in 1894, publishers J. S. Francis and J. L. Derrick. In 1915, she wrote for a black audience in the \"Oakland Sunshine\".\n\nDelilah Beasley chronicled African American \"firsts\", and notable achievements in early California in her book \"The Negro Trail-Blazers of California\" (1919). A compilation of records from the California Archives in the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley, searching newspapers from 1848 to the 1890s, all the black newspapers from the first in 1855 through 1919. Beasley \"Trail-Blazers\" book included diaries, biographical sketches, poetry commemorating black sacrifices, photographs, old papers, conversations of old pioneers, a comprehensive history of early legislation and court cases. Beasley's informative compilation of records is full of success stories. It gives many hundreds of names of blacks in California from the pioneer period to the late 19th century.\n\nBeasley writes about the black gold miners of the late 1840s:\n\nBeasley spent nine years writing her book, the book is important to historians of California and the West, and of African American western history. She knew many people who had been in California from the beginning of statehood and before. So much of what we know of California black pioneers grows out of her book. One of her possible heroes in the book was Lt. Col. Allen Allensworth, in 1908 founder of an all African American town in Allensworth, California, now a state park, Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park. Beasley wrote, \"The late Colonel Allensworth was born a slave, and yet there are few, if any, who have made more out of life and done more for their fellow man\".\n\nDelilah Beasley placed women prominently in her book. Over the next four decades, no other major works followed Beasley's volume. One might expect a plethora of articles and books concerning various aspects of black women's history during and immediately following the civil rights movements of the 1910s. Yet western black women received little attention.\n\nHer work on the book \"The Negro Trail-Blazers\" paved the way for Beasley to become the first Black woman in California to write regularly for a major metropolitan newspaper. By 1925 Delilah was writing regularly for the \"Oakland Tribune\". Her Sunday \"Tribune\" column was \"Activities Among Negroes\" and her name was also published with the articles. She often spent far over forty hours a week collecting material for her column. She wrote about churches, social events, women's clubs, literary societies, and local as well as national politics. Beasley's motivation was to give the white readers of the \"Oakland Tribune\" a positive picture of the black community. She documented the achievements of successful black men and women, in Oakland and elsewhere. By highlighting such items, she served her larger goal of demonstrating the capabilities of African-Americans while building a strong constituency for her column and a network of sources from whom she could count on receiving information. There is no doubt that in performing this service she laid an important part of the groundwork for the expanded inter-racial cooperation that developed during the Depression era of the 1930s. Richard Dillon, whose book on California Pioneers who had special qualities of their unusual and stimulating lives, wrote that Beasley was \"born 50 years before her time\". Beasley wrote for the \"Oakland Tribune\" from 1925–1934.\n\nBeasley, who never married, belonged to many civic organizations, including The Delilah L. Beasley Literary and Improvement Club, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), northern California branch founded in 1915, headquarters in Oakland. She was a member of the Alameda County League of Women Voters, the Public Welfare League of Alameda County, and the League of Nations Association of the California Federated Women's Club, which hosted the biennial convention in the Oakland Auditorium, attracting delegates from across the country. In 1920, Oakland's black club women, including Delilah Beasley and others, organized the Linden Center Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) to combat the cold reception extended to them by the all-white branches in the city. The Linden Center YWCA provided an array of services, including \"religious and vocational training, adult education, counseling services, and a full calendar of recreational and cultural programs\". In the mid-1920s, Beasley was a national historian of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), and the Alameda County League of Colored Women Voters, devoted press coverage to both in her column, \"Activities Among Negroes\", which ran in the white daily, the \"Oakland Tribune\". \nIn 1929, Beasley also used her professional skills and prominence in international groups to rebut white fears about the consequences of creating an International House at the University of California, Berkeley. Many Berkeley landlords protested the construction of the House, fearing an influx of foreigners. International House at UC Berkeley is a multi-cultural residence and program center serving students, the local community and alumni worldwide. Its mission is to foster intercultural respect, understanding, lifelong friendships and leadership skills for the promotion of a more tolerant and peaceful world. The university wrote: \"More than 800 people gathered in Berkeley to protest racial integration in the proposed International House. At that meeting, Delilah Beasley, a black reporter for the \"Oakland Tribune\", passionately defended the concept to a disgruntled and stunned audience. And it was Beasley who stood up to the protests of property owners who feared that I-House would cause Berkeley to be overrun with Blacks and Asians\". Notable I-House alumni and residents are, Delbert E. Wong, Jerry Brown, Oona King, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, Rose Bird, F. Drew Gaffney, Eric E. Schmidt, and Sadako Ogata.\n\nThe weekly column she wrote for the newspaper, \"Activities Among Negroes\", enhanced her standing in the community because of her ability to generate favorable publicity for black political struggles. Recognition of her ability to influence the white community strengthened her status within both white and black communities. She confronted misconceptions and contradictions as a newspaper journalist, and campaign against the use in the press of explicitly derogatory words when writing about African Americans. In 1932, Beasley organized the donation of a painting by a Black artist to the Oakland Museum. Due to her efforts as president of the “Far Western Inter-Racial Committee,” a painting by Eugene Burk, titled \"The Slave Mother\" was unveiled and presented to gallery director William Clapp, with Beasley expressing hope that \"the presentation of this picture to the permanent collection of the Oakland Municipal Art may be the means of opening many doors to young aspiring Negroes, not only of Oakland but of the United States.\" Clapp responded,\n\nIn 1933, it was at Beasley's urging that California State Assemblyman William F. Knowland, then assistant publisher of the \"Oakland Tribune\", and Assemblyman Frederick M. Roberts of Los Angeles County, introduced an anti-lynching bill, that passed unanimously in both branches of the California Legislature. It was the state's first mob violence law. The majority of lynching in California between 1850 and 1935 were perpetrated against Latinos, Native Americans, and Asian Americans.\n\nDelilah Leontium Beasley died on August 18, 1934, at Fairmont Hospital in San Leandro, California. According to her death certificate, the cause of death was arterio-sclerotic heart disease with hypertension. Her home at that time was listed as being in Oakland, California. She was laid to rest at Saint Mary Cemetery in Oakland. Twenty years later, a monument was erected, and a perpetual care endowed. Carved on the old tombstone is a simple epitaph: \"Author and columnist, a native of Ohio and for 25 years a resident of Oakland.\"\n\nVeteran and student journalists are honored with the Hall of Fame & Scholarship Awards of the Cincinnati chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists, with the \"Delilah Leontium Beasley Scholar\" awards.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34984967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34984967", "title": "Donor intent", "text": "Donor intent\n\nIn philanthropy, donor intent is the purpose, sometimes publicly expressed, for which a philanthropist intends a charitable gift or bequest. Donor intent is most often expressed in gift restrictions, terms, or agreements between a donor and donee, but it may also be expressed separately in the words, actions, beliefs, and giving practices of a philanthropist. Donor intent is protected in American law regarding charitable trusts, and trustees' primary fiduciary obligation is to carry out a donor's wishes.\n\nFidelity to donor intent is sometimes distinguished from grant compliance, and \"donor intent\" refers to the actions of a grantmaking entity and grant compliance refers to the actions of a grant recipient, but the term donor intent is commonly used to refer to both the guiding principles of a grantmaking entity and the purposes of a specific gift.\n\nThere have been many controversies, including litigation, over donor intent at private foundations, universities, and arts organizations.\n\nDonor intent has been defended as a moral obligation between giver and recipient. Defenders of donor intent argue that on a basic ethical level, trustees and gift recipients must do what they have agreed with the original donor to do, explicitly or implicitly: \"When donor intent is violated, and particularly when it is egregiously violated, it undermines the bedrock trust on which all charitable giving rests.\"\n\nDonor intent is thus also defended as necessary to ensure future charitable giving. Future donors might not be inclined to leave money to charitable causes if they see that trustees, grant recipients, or policymakers do not respect the stated intent. Peter Frumkin has written that \"as s a policy tool for encouraging future giving, protection of a donor's intent is needed to give future philanthropists the confidence they need to pass their wealth on to others to administer.\" Carl Schramm, former president of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, has said on donor intent, \"If we dont recognize it, we discourage wealthy people from creating foundations in the future.\"\n\nSurvey data of Americans indicates that donor intent and grant compliance are valued by the public. When asked by Zogby if they would stop giving money to a charity that ignored a request to use a previous donation for a specific purpose, 53% said they would \"definitely stop giving\" and an additional 25.7% would \"probably stop giving.\" When pollsters asked, \"How important do you think showing respect for a donor's wishes is to the ethical governance of nonprofit charitable organizations?,\" 82.9% considered it \"very important,\" 14.6% \"somewhat important.\"\n\nFinally, respect for donor intent is defended as necessary to preserve pluralism in civil society: \"Those who take the idea of donor intent seriously believe that only by protecting the idiosyncratic and at times outlandish ideas of donors will it be possible for philanthropy to innovate and pursue ideas that are either ahead of or behind their time,\" Frumkin has said.\n\nMany arguments against donor intent are made against honoring it in perpetuity. Such arguments date back at least to the 18th century and French economist Jacques Turgot: \"No work of man is made for immortality; and since foundations, always multiplied by vanity, would in the long run, if uninterfered with, absorb all funds and private properties, it would be absolutely necessary at last to destroy them.\"\n\nWhile not arguing against donor intent \"per se\", Julius Rosenwald criticized philanthropic funds that are established in perpetuity, arguing that narrowly defined statements of donor intent can be superseded as situations change: \" I have heard of a fund which provides a baked potato at each meal for each young woman at Bryn Mawr, and of another, dating from one of the great families, which pays for half a loaf of bread deposited each day at the door of each student in one of the colleges of Oxford... The list of these precisely focused gifts which have lost their usefulness could be extended into volumes.\"\n\nAnother argument against donor intent relates to whether limitations may be placed on donors' purposes, either prudential or legal. In \"Evans v. Abney\", the Supreme Court held that Augustus Octavius Bacon's clearly defined gift of a park to Macon, Georgia, for whites only was illegal under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and so the gift reverted to Bacon’s heirs. In cases that donor intent can be modified, courts have latitude to do that under \"cy pres\" doctrine. Finally, some critics of donor intent argue that it cements economic inequality.\n\nDonor intent is considered virtually impossible to be maintained in perpetuity because of changing situations, erosion of capital, and the distance of successor trustees from a donor. In some instances, however, donor intent has been lost only a short time after a donor's death. Waldemar Nielsen has argued that the Carnegie Corporation of New York swiftly lost the \"democratic, hopeful, and constructive\" spirit of Andrew Carnegie's giving: \"That within five years of his death his Corporation should have turned into a racist and reactionary machine to defend the privileges of the old WASP elite and block the advancement of immigrants and the underprivileged deformed his spirit and intent.\" In the early 2000s, the Daniels Fund, established by Bill Daniels, drifted away from what Daniels' trustees considered to be his principles, and the drift was arrested by board action. \nSome donors have adopted strategies to prevent philanthropies that they create from drifting from donor intent.\n\nRosenwald cautioned donors against perpetuity: \"I am opposed to gifts in perpetuity for any purpose.\" Some donors have attempted to preserve their intent either by \"giving while living\" or by establishing a date or timeframe in the future by which a foundation must disburse its assets, or \"sunset.\" Chuck Feeney founded the Atlantic Philanthropies, which is scheduled to spend down its assets by 2017. In 1975, inspired by the controversy over donor intent at the Ford Foundation, John M. Olin adopted plans for the John M. Olin Foundation to disburse its assets by 2005. Olin believed that capitalism was the basis of prosperity and sought to promote conservative political and legal thinking. The spend-down plan gave the Olin Foundation the spending profile of a foundation with three times as many assets, Jeffrey Cain has written: \"The Olin Foundation made a deliberate decision to have a profound impact on its time, rather than a lighter one that spanned years into the future.\"\n\nCarnegie left the Carnegie Corporation's mission vague and open-ended by instructing his successors to \"promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding\" but also granting \"full authority to change policies or causes hitherto aided, from time to time, when this, in their opinion, has become necessary or desirable. They shall best conform to my wishes by using their own judgment.\" In creating the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, John D. MacArthur reportedly told his lawyer, \"I'll make [the money]. But you people, after I'm dead, will have to learn how to spend it.\"\n\nOther donors are much narrower. James B. Duke specified percentages of the annual payout that would go to various categories of giving by the Duke Endowment, including even a formula for reimbursing charity hospitals. Today, some donors leave detailed documents to supplement official mission statements, including reflections on their principles, video statements, and records of their personal giving.\n\nOften, donors select family members, personal business associates, lawyers, or nonprofit leaders to serve on their boards. The Daniels Fund requires trustees to sign a statement affirming that they understand Bill Daniels' donor intent and will honor it in their decision-making on behalf of the foundation. The foundation that was created by Lloyd Noble recruits apprentice trustees to shadow the actual board; some are elected to the board in the future. At meetings of the Duke Endowment's board, James B. Duke's original indenture of trust is read aloud to reinforce his intentions. The John Templeton Foundation has a provision for periodic \"donor intent audits\" to ensure its officers uphold John Templeton's purposes.\n\n\n"}

It took place on April 20, 2010. These potentially included structural shifts to energy policy, insurance marketplaces and risk assessment, and potential liabilities of the order of tens of billions of US dollars for one or more large and well known companies - principally BP.\n\nAs a response to the disaster, on 30 April President Barack Obama ordered the federal government to hold the issuing of new offshore drilling leases until a review determined whether more safety systems were needed and authorized teams to investigate 29 oil rigs in the Gulf in an effort to determine the cause of the disaster. Later a six-month offshore drilling (below of water) moratorium was enforced by the United States Department of the Interior. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar ordered immediate inspections of all deep-water operations in the Gulf of Mexico. An Outer Continental Shelf safety review board within the Department of the Interior is to provide recommendations for conducting drilling activities in the Gulf. The moratorium suspended work on 33 rigs. It was challenged by several drilling and oil services companies. On 22 June, a United States federal judge on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana Martin Leach-Cross Feldman when ruling in the case Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar, lifted the moratorium finding it too broad, arbitrary and not adequately justified. The Department of Justice appealed to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted the request for an expedited hearing. A three judge panel is scheduled to hear oral arguments on 8 July.\nOn 30 June, Salazar said that \"he is working very hard to finalize a new offshore drilling moratorium\". Michael Bromwich, the head of the newly created Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, said that a record of \"bad performance, deadly performance\" by an oil company should be considered \"a relevant factor\" for the government when it decides if that company should be awarded future drilling leases. Representative George Miller plans to introduce to the energy reform bill under consideration in the United States House of Representatives that a company's safety record should factor into leasing decisions. By this amendment he wants to ban BP from leasing any additional offshore area for seven years because of \"extensive record of serious worker safety and environmental violations\".\n\nOn 28 April, the National Energy Board of Canada, which regulates offshore drilling in the Canadian Arctic and along the British Columbia Coast, issued a letter to oil companies asking them to explain their argument against safety rules which require same-season relief wells. Five days later, the Canadian Minister of the Environment Jim Prentice said the government would not approve a decision to relax safety or environment regulations for large energy projects. On 3 May California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger withdrew his support for a proposed plan to allow expanded offshore drilling projects in California. On 8 July, Florida Governor Charlie Crist called for a special session of the state legislature to draft an amendment to the state constitution banning offshore drilling in state waters, which the legislature rejected on 20 July.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that in 2010, 23.5% of U.S. oil production came from offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico The chief argument in the U.S. offshore drilling debate has been to make the United States less dependent on imported oil. American dependence on imports grew from 24% in 1970 to 66% in 2008.\n\nLocal officials in Louisiana expressed concern that the moratorium imposed in response to the spill would further harm the economies of coastal communities as the oil industry employs about 58,000 Louisiana residents and has created another 260,000 oil-related jobs, accounting for about 17% of all Louisiana jobs.\n\nAt the time of the disaster it was said that there were only 4 companies able to insure risks of such size. The impact of \"Deepwater Horizon\" on insurance, reinsurance and other global markets due to the shift in systemic risk is as yet unknown. Until this incident loss of an entire semi-submersible rig in this way was considered \"an unprecedented tragedy\" with an underwriter at Pritchard Capital commenting \"It's never happened that a semi could burn into the sea and completely sink. Now underwriters have to include that as a risk. That’s probably $10,000 to $15,000 more per day in rig insurance. They’ll make it up by charging more on a per-rig basis.\" \n\nThe Organization for International Investment, a Washington-based advocate for overseas investment into the U.S., warned in early July that the political rhetoric surrounding the disaster is potentially damaging the reputation of all British companies with operations in the U.S. and sparked a wave of U.S. protectionism that has restricted British firms from; winning government contracts, making political donations, and lobbying.\n\nIn BP's Initial Exploration Plan, dated 10 March 2009, it said that \"it is unlikely that an accidental spill would occur\" and \"no adverse activities are anticipated\" to fisheries or fish habitat. On 29 April 2010, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency in the state after weather forecasts predicted the oil slick would reach the Louisiana coast. An emergency shrimping season was opened on 29 April so that a catch could be brought in before the oil advanced too far. By 30 April, the USCG received reports that oil had begun washing up to wildlife refuges and seafood grounds on the Louisiana Gulf Coast. On 22 May 2010, the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board stated said 60 to 70% of oyster and blue crab harvesting areas and 70 to 80% of fin-fisheries remained open. The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals closed an additional ten oyster beds on 23 May, just south of Lafayette, Louisiana, citing confirmed reports of oil along the state's western coast.\n\nOn 2 May 2010, NOAA closed commercial and recreational fishing in affected federal waters between the mouth of the Mississippi River and Pensacola Bay. The closure initially incorporated . By 21 June, NOAA had increased the area under closure over a dozen times, encompassing by that date , or approximately 36% of Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and extending along the coast from Atchafalaya Bay, Louisiana to Panama City, Florida. On 24 May, the federal government declared a fisheries disaster for the states of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Initial cost estimates to the fishing industry were $2.5 billion.\n\nOn 23 June, NOAA ended its fishing ban in , leaving with no fishing allowed, or about one-third of the Gulf. The continued fishing ban was meant to assure the safety of seafood, and NOAA inspectors announced that as of 9 July, Kevin Griffis of the Commerce Department said, only one seafood sample out of 400 tested did not pass, and even that one did not include \"concerning levels of contaminants\". On 10 August, Jane Lubchenco of NOAA said no one had seen oil in a area east of Pensacola since 3 July, so the fishing ban in that area was being lifted.\n\nOn 31 August, a Boston lab hired by the United Commercial Fishermen's Association to analyze coastal fishing waters said it found dispersant in a seafood sample taken near Biloxi, Miss., almost a month after BP said it had stopped using the chemical.\n\nAccording to the European Space Agency, the agency's satellite data was used by the Ocean Foundation to conclude that 20% of the juvenile bluefin tuna were killed by oil in the gulf's most important spawning area. The foundation combined satellite data showing the oil spill extent each week with data on weekly tuna spawning to make their conclusion. The agency also said that the loss of juvenile tuna was significant due to the 82% decline of the tuna's spawning stock in the western Atlantic during the 30 years before the oil spill.\n\nThe waters had been reopened to fishing on 15 November 2010, but on 24 November NOAA re-closed area to shrimping. A Florida TV station sent frozen Gulf shrimp to be tested for petroleum by-products after recent reports showed scientists disagreed on whether it is safe to eat after the oil spill. A private lab found levels of Anthracene, a toxic hydrocarbon and a by-product of petroleum, at twice the levels the FDA finds acceptable. On 20 April, NOAA reopened of Gulf waters immediately surrounding the Deepwater Horizon wellhead to commercial and recreational fishing of fish, oysters, crabs and shrimp after testing results found that 99 percent of samples contained no detectable dispersant residues or oil-related compounds, and the few samples that did contain residues showed levels more than 1000 times lower than FDA levels of concern. This was the twelfth and final reopening in federal waters since 22 July, and opened all the formerly closed areas in Federal waters. Allowable levels for the toxins in Gulf seafood are based on health impacts for a 176-pound adult eating less than 2 medium shrimp per day.\n\nIn July 2011 BP released a report claiming that the economy had recovered and there was no reason to believe that anyone would suffer future losses from the spill, with the limited exception of oyster harvesters. However, Bruce Guerra, a crab fisherman in Louisiana for 25 years, said that since the BP oil spill crabbers are trapping 75 percent fewer crabs and that \"crabs have been coming up dead, discolored, or riddled with holes since last year's spill\". Others in the fishing industry say it could take years to fully realize the spill's effects. \"The problem is right when they used the dispersants, that's when the tuna came to the Gulf to spawn,\" said Cheril Carey, a national sales representative for a Louisiana company specializing in yellow fin tuna. \"It takes a tuna five to 15 years to mature. So although we may have fish now, we may not have them in five to 15 years.\"\n\nIn late 2012 local fishermen report that crab, shrimp, and oyster fishing operations have not yet recovered from the oil spill and many fear that the Gulf seafood industry will never recover. One Mississippi shrimper who was interviewed said he used to get 8,000 pounds of shrimp in four days, but this year he got only 800 pounds a week. Mississippi's oyster reefs have been closed since the spill started. A Louisiana fisherman said the local oyster industry might do 35 per cent this year, \"If we're very lucky.\" Dr Ed Cake, a biological oceanographer and a marine and oyster biologist, said that many of the Gulf fisheries have collapsed and \"If it takes too long for them to come back, the fishing industry won't survive\". In 2010, SBP (nonprofit organization) began to provide assistance to fishermen affected by what came to be known as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\nAlthough many people cancelled their vacations due to the spill, hotels close to the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama reported dramatic increases in business during the first half of May 2010. However, the increase was likely due to the influx of people who had come to work with oil removal efforts. Jim Hutchinson, assistant secretary for the Louisiana Office of Tourism, called the occupancy numbers misleading, but not surprising. \"Because of the oil slick, the hotels are completely full of people dealing with that problem,\" he said. \"They're certainly not coming here as tourists. People aren't sport fishing, they aren't buying fuel at the marinas, they aren't staying at the little hotels on the coast and eating at the restaurants.\"\n\nOn 25 May, BP gave Florida $25 million to promote the beaches where the oil had not reached, and the company planned $15 million each for Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Bay Area Tourist Development Council bought digital billboards showing recent photos from the gulf coast beaches as far north as Nashville, Tennessee and Atlanta. Along with assurances that the beaches were so far unaffected, hotels cut rates and offered deals such as free golf. Also, cancellation policies were changed, and refunds were promised to those where oil may have arrived. However, revenues remained below 2009 levels.\n\nThe U.S. Travel Association estimated that the economic impact of the oil spill on tourism across the Gulf Coast over a three-year period could exceed approximately $23 billion, in a region that supports over 400,000 travel industry jobs generating $34 billion in revenue annually.\n\nOn 1 November, BP announced plans to spend $78 million to help Louisiana tourism and test and advertise seafood.\n\nThe real estate prices and a number of transactions in the Gulf of Mexico area decreased significantly during the period of the oil spill. As a result, area officials wanted the state legislature to allow property tax to be paid based on current market value, which according to Florida State Rep. Dave Murzin could mean millions of dollars in losses for each county affected.\n\nBP - at the time the United Kingdom's largest corporation and a major business in the UK investment world - came under intense popular, media, and political pressure to cancel its 2010 dividends in their entirety. Media reports state that BP is of such a size and significance in that country, that \"one pound in every seven\" of investment and pension fund income in the UK is derived from BP. Local media offered views on what this might mean for citizens. As BP was reported to be \"offloading billions of dollars in assets\" in preparation, some estimates suggested the total liability could amount to as much as by the conclusion of the disaster. Financial analysts commented that BP was capable of addressing the potential liabilities that might result, and BP stock rose slightly on the news that the initial compensation fund had been agreed.\n\nOn 5 July 2010, BP reported that its own expenditures on the oil spill had reached $3.12 billion, including the cost of the spill response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to the Gulf states, claims paid, and federal costs. As of 1 October 2010, BP has spent $11.2 billion. As of March 2012, BP estimated the company's total spill-related expenses do not exceed $37.2 billion.\n\nThe United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990 limits BP's liability for non-cleanup costs to $75 million unless gross negligence is proven. BP has said it would pay for all cleanup and remediation regardless of the statutory liability cap. Nevertheless, some Democratic lawmakers sought to pass legislation that would increase the liability limit to $10 billion. Analysts for Swiss Re have estimated that the total insured losses from the accident could reach $3.5 billion. According to UBS, final losses could be $12 billion. According to Willis Group Holdings, total losses could amount to $30 billion, of which estimated total claims to the market from the disaster, including control of well, re-drilling, third-party liability and seepage and pollution costs, could exceed $1.2 billion.\n\nAfter announcement of the six-month moratorium on drilling in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico BP agreed to allocate $100 million for payments to offshore oil workers who were unemployed due to the moratorium.\n\nBP's stock fell by 51% in 40 days on the New York Stock Exchange, going from $60.57 on 20 April 2010, to $29.20 on 9 June, its lowest level since August 1996. On 25 June, BP's market value reached a 1-year low. The company's total value lost since 20 April was $105 billion. Investors saw their holdings in BP shrink to $27.02, a nearly 54% loss of value in 2010. A month later, the company's loss in market value totalled $60 billion, a 35% decline since the explosion. At that time, BP reported a second-quarter loss of $17 billion, its first loss in 18 years. This included a one-time $32.2 billion charge, including $20 billion for the fund created for reparations and $2.9 billion in actual costs.\n\nBP announced that it was setting up a new unit to oversee management of the oil spill and its aftermath, to be headed by former TNK-BP chief executive Robert Dudley, who a month later was named CEO of BP.\n\nOn 1 October, BP's London Stock Exchange price reached 439.75 pence, the highest point since 28 May.\n\nBy 2013, BP had dropped from the second to the fourth largest of the four major oil companies.\n\nOn 4 September 2014, when BP was found guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct under the Clean Water Act (CWA), which could see it liable for up to $18 billion in additional fines, the company's shares lost 6 percent of their value.\n\nBP gas stations in the United States, the majority of which the company does not own, reported sales off between 10 and 40% due to backlash against the company. Some BP station owners that lost sales said the name should change back to Amoco, while others said after all the effort that went into promoting BP, such a move would be a gamble, and the company should work to restore its image.\n\n"}

This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.\n\nHistories of science were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with William Whewell, as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the Soviet historian Boris Hessen, was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After World War II, extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by Thomas Kuhn, the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. At the present time it is often closely aligned with the field of science studies.\n\nModern engineering as it is understood today took form during the scientific revolution, though much of the mathematics and science was built on the work of the Greeks, Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Chinese, Indians. See the main articles History of science and History of technology for these respective topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory of science and technology is a well developed field in India. At least three generations of scholars can be identified.\nThe first generation includes D.D.Kosambi, Dharmpal, Debiprasad Chattopadhyay and Rahman. The second generation mainly consists of Ashis Nandy, Deepak Kumar, Dhruv Raina, S. Irfan Habib, Shiv Visvanathan, Gyan Prakash, Stan Lourdswamy, V.V. Krishna, Itty Abraham, Richard Grove, Kavita Philip, Mira Nanda and Rob Anderson. There is an emergent third generation that includes scholars like Abha Sur and Jahnavi Phalkey.\n\nDepartments and Programmes\n\nThe National Institute of Science, Technolology and Development Studies had a research group active in the 1990s which consolidated social history of science as a field of research in India. \nCurrently there are several institutes and university departments offering HST programmes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic study of the History of Science as an independent discipline was launched by George Sarton at Harvard with his book \"Introduction to the History of Science\" (1927) and the \"Isis\" journal (founded in 1912). Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians. With the work of I. Bernard Cohen at Harvard, the history of Science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistoriography of science\n\nHistory of science as a discipline\n\n"}
{"id": "19176448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19176448", "title": "History of suits", "text": "History of suits\n\nThe man's suit of clothes, in the sense of a lounge or business or office suit, is a set of garments which are crafted from the same cloth. This article discusses the history of the lounge suit, often called a business suit when made in dark colors and of conservative cut.\n\nThe suit is a traditional form of men's formal clothes in the Western world. For some four hundred years, suits of matching coat, trousers, and waistcoat have been in and out of fashion. The modern lounge suit's derivation is visible in the outline of the brightly coloured, elaborately crafted royal court dress of the 17th century (suit, wig, knee breeches), which was shed because of the French Revolution. This evolution is seen more recently in British tailoring's use of steam and padding in moulding woolen cloth, the rise and fall in popularity of the necktie, and the gradual disuse of waistcoats and hats in the last fifty years.\n\nThe modern lounge suit appeared in the late 19th century, but traces its origins to the simplified, sartorial standard of dress established by the English king Charles II in the 17th century. In 1666, the restored monarch, Charles II, per the example of King Louis XIV's court at Versailles, decreed that in the English Court men would wear a long coat, a waistcoat (then called a \"petticoat\"), a cravat (a precursor of the necktie), a wig, knee breeches (trousers), and a hat. However, the paintings of Jan Steen, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and other painters of the Dutch Golden Era reveal that such an arrangement was already used informally in Holland, if not Western Europe as a whole. Many of Steen's genre paintings include men dressed in hip-length or frock coats with shirt and trousers, which in fact more closely resemble modern suit designs than the contemporary British standard.\n\nIn the early 19th century, British dandy Beau Brummell redefined, adapted, and popularized the style of the British court, leading European men to wearing well-cut, tailored clothes, adorned with carefully knotted neckties. The simplicity of the new clothes and their somber colors contrasted strongly with the extravagant, foppish styles just before. Brummell's influence introduced the modern era of men's clothing which now includes the modern suit and necktie. Moreover, he introduced a whole new era of grooming and style, including regular (daily) bathing as part of a man's toilette. However, paintings of French men from 1794 onwards reveal that Brummel might only have adopted and popularized post-revolutionary French suits, which included tail coat, double-breasted waistcoat and full-length trousers with either Hessian boots or regular-size shoes. There is no 18th-century painting of Brummel to establish his innovation. The modern suit design seems to be inspired by the utilitarian dressing of hunters and military offiicers. Paintings of the decade 1760 reveal how the modern coat design with lapels emerged. It can be seen in the hunting scene with Count Carl Emil Ulrich von Donop as subject by an unknown artist and Frederick William Ernest, Count von Schaumburg-Lippe in Hanoverian Field Marshall uniform painted by Joshua Reynolds. \n\nIn this regency period, the predominant upper-class clothing introduced by Brummell for day wear was a tightly fitting, dark coloured tailcoat with non-matching (usually pale) trousers, pale waistcoat, white shirt and cravat and tall boots.\n\nTowards the start of the Victorian period, the frock coat, initially not just black, became popular, and quickly became the standard daily clothing for gentlemen. From the middle of the 19th century, a new (then informal) coat, the morning coat, became acceptable. It was a less formal garment, with a cut away front, making it suitable for wearing while riding. Morning dress and the frock coat garments were not suits, because they were worn with trousers that didn't match in color or fabric; a matching waistcoat and trousers were considered informal and could be described using the short-lived term ditto suit. The frock coat was still the standard garment for all formal or business occasions, and a tailcoat was worn in the evenings.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the modern lounge suit was born as a very informal garment meant only to be worn for sports, in the country, or at the seaside.\nParallel to this, the dinner jacket was invented and came to be worn for informal evening events. It was descended from white tie (the dress code associated with the evening tailcoat) but quickly became a full new garment, the dinner jacket, with a new dress code, initially known as 'dress lounge' and later black tie. When it was imported to the United States, it became known as the tuxedo. The 'dress lounge' was originally worn only for small private gatherings and white tie ('White tie and tails') was still worn for large formal events. The 'dress lounge' slowly became more popular for larger events as an alternative to full evening dress in white tie.\n\nThe beginning of the Edwardian era in the early 20th century brought a steady decline in the wearing of frock coats as the morning coat rose in relative formality, first becoming acceptable for businessmen, then becoming standard dress even in town. The lounge suit was slowly accepted as being correct outside its original settings, and during Edwardian times gradually began to be seen in town. While still reserved for private gatherings, usually with no ladies, black tie became more common.\n\nIn North America, the \"sack suit\", a cut of lounge suit, saw a large rise in popularity, and, except for the shoulders, it is unfitted, loose, and informal, as it has no darts.\n\nAfter the end of the first World War, most men adopted the short lounge coated suit. Long coats quickly went out of fashion for everyday wear and business, and the morning coat gained its current classification of \"formal\". During the 1920s, short suits were always worn except on formal occasions in the daytime, when a morning coat would be worn. Older, more conservative men continued to wear a frock coat, or \"Prince Albert coat\" as it was known. \n\nIn North America, for evening occasions, the short dinner jacket virtually replaced the long \"full dress\" tails, which was perceived as \"old hat\" and was only worn by old conservative men. In Britain, black tie became acceptable as a general informal alternative to white tie, though at the time the style and accessories of black tie were still very fluid.\n\nIn the 1920s men began wearing wide, straight-legged trousers with their suits. These trousers normally measured 23 inches around the cuff. Younger men often wore even wider-legged trousers which were known as \"Oxford bags.\" Trousers also began to be worn cuffed shortly after World War I and this style persisted until World War II. Trousers first began to be worn creased in the 1920s. Trousers were worn very highly waisted throughout the 1920s and this fashion remained in vogue until the 1940s. Single-breasted suits were in style throughout the 1920s and the double-breasted suit was mainly worn by older more conservative men. In the 1920s, very fashionable men would often wear double-breasted waistcoats (with four buttons on each side) with single-breasted coats. Lapels on single-breasted suits were fashionably worn peaked and were often wide. In the early 1930s these styles continued and were often even further exaggerated.\n\nBefore 1935 (and again in the 1970s) men preferred snugly tailored coats and waistcoats. In 1935, a complete change in style occurred. Loose fitting coats were introduced, trousers began to be tapered at the bottom and suit coats began to have tapered arms. These new trends were only reluctantly accepted by men at first. At first the waistcoat continued to be made in the traditional fitted and snug style. By 1940, the waistcoat began to be made in a loose style which made it uncomfortable to wear. In fashion magazines of the day, men complained how these new vests continually rode up when they happen to sit down or bend over. Fashionable men changed their preference to the double-breasted suit coat at this time and it would remain in fashion for the next two decades.\n\nBy this time, morning dress was being replaced by day time semi-formal, known in North America as the stroller. This was quite popular, but has actually been outlived by the morning coat. Since the 1950s it has been used as a black version of the lounge suit as an informal look to the dinner jacket. In modern times the black lounge suit has become popular to wear during the day.\n\nReflecting the democratization of wealth and larger trend toward simplification in the decades following the Second World War, the suit was standardized and streamlined. Suit coats were cut as straight as possible without any indication of a waistline, and by the 1960s the lapel had become narrower than at any time prior. Cloth rationing during the war had forced significant changes in style, contributing to a large reduction in the popularity of cuts such as the double-breasted suit.\n\nThe \"New York Times Style Magazine\" explains one iconic suit of the era, the gray flannel suit:\n\nBack in 1955, when denim was the height of rebelliousness, Sloan Wilson's novel \"The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit\" turned a men's classic into a synonym for drab, middle-class conformity . . . Flannel had humble beginnings — the name is reputedly derived from \"gwlanen,\" Welsh for woolen cloth — and was used for underwear in the 19th century. In the 1880s white flannel was worn for summer sports; by the 1920s the more seasonless gray had become a favorite. When the Prince of Wales wore gray flannel trousers on his 1924 trip to America, they were aped by collegiates on both sides of the Atlantic. Cary Grant and Fred Astaire then carried the trend through to the 1940s. The archetypal square of the postwar era was later described by Esquire's style encyclopedia as \"a neat, circumspect, conservative man who carried an attaché case and regarded a pink button-down shirt as his one sartorial fling.\"\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s the Nehru jacket, an Indian style featuring a mandarin collar, was introduced by entertainers such as Johnny Carson and The Beatles, and saw a brief surge in popularity across Western Europe and the United States.\n\nIn the 1970s, a snug-fitting suit coat became popular once again, also encouraging the return of the waistcoat. This new three-piece style became closely associated with culture, and was specifically popularized by the film \"Saturday Night Fever\". Fashion brands such Haggar meanwhile started to introduce the concept of \"suit separates\", a production innovation that reduced the need for excessive customization.\n\nThe 1980s saw a trend towards the simplification of the suit once again. The jacket became looser and the waistcoat was completely dispensed with. A few suit makers continued to make waistcoats, but these tended to be cut low and often had only four buttons. The waistline on the suit coat moved down again in the 1980s to a position well below the waist. By 1985-1986, three-piece suits were on the way out and making way for cut double-breasted and two-piece single-breasted suits.\n\nThe late 1990s saw the return to popularity of the three-button two-piece suit, which then went back out of fashion some time in the first decade of the twenty-first century.\n\nThe earliest women's suits were riding habits, which consisted of a tailored coat or jacket and matching skirt from the 1660s. Practical and sturdy, riding habits were worn not only on horseback, but also for travel and other daytime pursuits. Jacket-and-skirt ensembles not intended for riding appeared in the later 19th century. Both riding habits and walking suits reflected the skirt and sleeve styles of the day. Until the 1910s, coat and skirt ensembles were usually described as \"costumes\" rather than suits, and the term \"suit\", as applied to such sets, was not usual until after the First World War.\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, the skirted suit became the common daytime city costume for women, in the workplace and out; dressmaker suits featured softer fabrics and \"feminine\" details, and cocktail suits were worn for semi-formal occasions in mid-century. \n\nUnder the influence of \"Dress for Success\", a working woman's uniform of skirted suit, tailored shirt, and floppy tie evolved in the 1970s and 1980s. Pantsuits (women's suits with Eastern style trousers) were introduced by designer André Courrèges in 1964 but were only gradually accepted as formal business attire.\n\nOver the past half-century, the wearing of suits has become far less common than it once was and is now usually reserved for formal and business activities. During the 1990s, many businesses in North America adopted casual dress codes, beginning with \"Casual Fridays\" and then extending to the entire business week. The abandonment of a uniform dress code has led to considerable confusion over what is considered appropriate business wear. More recently, some organizations have reinforced formal dress codes, although they may never again be as common as they once were.\n\nAlthough the man's European tailored suit is commonly perceived as the ultimate conservative costume of Western culture, Eastern influences or extravagant variations on the tailored suit have been adopted by many subcultures over the last century as a matter of fashion or social identity. As early as 1922, Emily Post addressed what she termed the \"freak American suit\" in her influential guide \"Etiquette\":\n\nSome of the non-traditional tailored suit styles of the past century include:\n\n\n"}

Arundel (1 September 1841 – 30 November 1919) was an English entrepreneur who was instrumental in the development of the mining of phosphate rock on the Pacific islands of Nauru and Banaba (Ocean Island). Williams & Macdonald (1985) described J.T. Arundel as \"a remarkable example of that mid-Victorian phenomenon, the upright, pious and adventurous Christian English businessman.\"\n\nHis father owned a gentleman's outfitter in the City of London and a warehouse business on the Thames estuary, with the family living at Gravesend. The family were active in the Congregational Church, and through a church connection he joined Houlder Brothers & Co., a firm that provided ships for migration to New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIn 1860, J.T. Arundel travelled on a Houlder Brothers & Co ship into the Pacific, calling at the Chincha Islands, on which guano was mined for refining into superphosphate. J.T. Arundel took an interest in the potential of the fertiliser business and in 1868 the company sent him on a second voyage into the Pacific to pursue opportunities.\n\nWhen J.T. Arundel set off in 1871 to develop a business in the Pacific he left his fiancée Eliza Eleanor (Lillie) Whibley in England, as he wanted to secure their financial security by achieving success with his business ventures. J .T. Arundel and Lillie Whibley were not to marry until 1881. Following their marriage Lillie Arundel would travel into the central Pacific with J.T. Arundel when he would visit the various islands on which his company has operations. Lillie Arundel gave birth in 1884 to their second daughter while on Manra, then known as Sydney Island, giving her the name of that island.\n\nIn 1898 Fred Whibley, Lillie's younger brother, arrived in Sydney, after 10 years in the United States and Canada. J .T. Arundel offered Fred Whibley a position with John T. Arundel & Co. Fred Whibley declined and chose to become an island trader on Niutao in what is now Tuvalu. A harmonious working relationship would have been unlikely given the pious Christian attitudes of J.T. Arundel and Fred Whibley's reputation as the 'black sheep' of the family.\n\nIn 1871 with financial support from Houlder Brothers and Co., he established John T. Arundel & Co. The initial activities were carried out by the two companies. Houlder Brothers and Co leased Flint Island from the British government and Arundel managed the guano digging in the central part of the island from 1875 to 1880. In 1872, Caroline Island was leased by the Houlder Brothers. In 1881, the lease was later taken over by Arundel (for whom one of the islets is named). \n\nJohn T. Arundel & Co went on to engage in mining guano on other Pacific islands and also established coconut plantations and traded in copra and other commodities. The company operated from Sydney, Australia with business interests in the Pacific that included:\n\nAlbert Ellis who worked for John T. Arundel & Co., later acknowledged that the company was not making money although the company was gaining experience in the mining and shipping of guano and phosphate rock in what were sometimes difficult conditions, with many of these islands having no safe anchorage for shipping.\n\nIn 1897 John T. Arundel & Co., merged its business with that of the trading and plantation firm of Henderson and Macfarlane to form the Pacific Islands Company Ltd ('PIC'). The company was based in London with its trading activities in the Pacific. The Chairman of the PIC was Lord Stanmore, formerly Sir Arthur Gordon, Governor of Fiji and first High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. John T. Arundel was the vice-chairman.\n\nThe PIC continued to expand its plantation interests and in 1899, acquired a license to develop coconut plantations on Birnie Island, which is geographically part of the Phoenix Islands and is part of Kiribati, with the PIC acquiring licenses to develop coconut plantations in the Solomon Islands.\n\nDespite this attempt to broaden the operations of the company the company remained chronically short of capital throughout its existence and was lent money from time to time by its directors.\n\nIn 1899 Albert Ellis made what he later described as \"\"a good 'find\"'\", when he had laboratory analysis carried out on a rock that was used to prop open the Sydney office door, as it appeared similar to the hard phosphate rock that he had seen on Baker Island The laboratory analysis confirmed that the rock was high grade phosphate. Albert Ellis and other company employees travelled to Banaba to confirm that the soil of that island was largely phosphate rock. A. F. Ellis went on to Nauru, at that time a German territory, and confirmed it also consisted of large deposits of phosphate rock.\n\nJ. T. Arundel and Lord Stanmore were responsible for financing the new opportunities and negotiating with the German company that controlled the licences to mine in Nauru. In 1902 the interests of PIC were merged with Jaluit Gesellschaft of Hamburg, to form the Pacific Phosphate Company, ('PPC') to engage in phosphate mining in Nauru and Banaba, then known as Ocean Island. The company's engineers had to find solutions for transferring the phosphate rock from the island to ships that had to anchor off the island. As high islands both Nauru and Banaba did not have lagoons or anchorages that protected ships from the Pacific storms. Solutions were found and despite losing some 5 ships on the reef at Ocean Island, the PPC became a very profitable company. The profitability of the company directed attention to the original agreements made with the land owners of Nauru and Banaba. The agreement with the Banabans was for the exclusive right to mine for 999 years for £50 a year. The terms of the licenses were changed to provide for the payment of royalties and compensation for mining damage.\n\nIn 1913 an anonymous correspondent to the New Age journal criticised the operation of the PPC under the title \"Modern buccaneers in the West Pacific\".\n\nThe PPC investigated phosphate deposits on Makatea in the Tuamotus in French Polynesia and formed a company, the Compagnie des Phosphates de l'Océanie, with a Tahitian syndicate that was also investigating the potential of Makatea. This gave the PPC a virtual monopoly on the sources of high grade phosphate in the Pacific.\n\nIn 1919 the business of the PPC in Nauru and Banaba was acquired by Board of the British Phosphate Commission. From 1919 the responsibility for the welfare of the people of Nauru and Banaba, the restoring of land and water resources lost by mining operations and compensation for environmental damage to the islands was under the control of the governments of United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.\n\n\nPersonal papers and journals of J .T. Arundel and business papers and records of John T. Arundel & Co., the Pacific Islands Company Ltd and the Pacific Phosphate Company Ltd are held by the Pacific Manuscripts Bureau (PAMBU), Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies (RSPAS), Australian National University (ANU), Canberra—23 reels of microfilm.\n"}

{"id": "61410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61410", "title": "Louis Braille", "text": "Louis Braille\n\nLouis Braille (; ; 4 January 1809 – 6 January 1852) was a French educator and inventor of a system of reading and writing for use by the blind or visually impaired. His system remains virtually unchanged to this day, and is known worldwide simply as braille.\n\nBlinded in both eyes as a result of an early childhood accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind. He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824.\n\nIn adulthood, Braille served as a professor at the Institute and had an avocation as a musician, but he largely spent the remainder of his life refining and extending his system. It went unused by most educators for many years after his death, but posterity has recognized braille as a revolutionary invention, and it has been adapted for use in languages worldwide.\n\nLouis Braille was born in Coupvray, a small town about twenty miles east of Paris, on 4 January 1809. He and his three elder siblings – Monique Catherine (b. 1793), Louis-Simon (b. 1795), and Marie Céline (b. 1797) – lived with their parents, Simon-René and Monique, on three hectares of land and vineyards in the countryside. Simon-René maintained a successful enterprise as a leatherer and maker of horse tack.\n\nAs soon as he could walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local physician bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.\n\nLouis Braille survived the torment of the infection but by the age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.\nBraille studied in Coupvray until the age of ten. Because of his combination of intelligence and diligence, Braille was permitted to attend one of the first schools for blind children in the world, the Royal Institute for Blind Youth, since renamed to the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris. Braille, the last of the family's children to leave the household, departed for the school in February 1819. At that time the Royal Institute was an underfunded, ramshackle affair, but it provided a relatively stable environment for blind children to learn and associate together.\n\nThe children were taught how to read by a system devised by the school's founder, Valentin Haüy. Not blind himself, Haüy was a philanthropist who devoted his life to helping the blind. He designed and manufactured a small library of books for the children using a technique of embossing heavy paper with the raised imprints of Latin letters. Readers would trace their fingers over the text, comprehending slowly but in a traditional fashion which Haüy could appreciate.\n\nBraille was helped by the Haüy books, but he also despaired over their lack of depth: the amount of information kept in such books was necessarily small. Because the raised letters were made in a complex artisanal process using wet paper pressed against copper wire, the children could not hope to \"write\" by themselves. So that the young Louis could send letters back home, Simon-René provided him with an alphabet made from bits of thick leather. It was a slow and cumbersome process, but the boy could at least trace the letters' outlines and write his first sentences.\n\nThe handcrafted Haüy books all came in uncomfortable sizes and weights for children. They were laboriously constructed, very fragile, and expensive to obtain: when Haüy's school first opened, it had a total of three books. Nonetheless, Haüy promoted their use with zeal. To him, the books presented a system which would be readily approved by educators and indeed they seemed – to the sighted – to offer the best achievable results. Braille and his schoolmates, however, could detect all too well the books' crushing limitations. Nonetheless, Haüy's efforts still provided a breakthrough achievement – the recognition of the sense of touch as a workable strategy for sightless reading. Haüy's only personal limitation was that he was \"talking to the fingers with the language of the eye.\"\n\nBraille read the Haüy books repeatedly, and he was equally attentive to the oral instruction offered by the school. He proved to be a highly proficient student and, after he had exhausted the school's curriculum, he was immediately asked to remain as a teacher's aide. By 1833, he was elevated to a full professorship. For much of the rest of his life, Braille stayed at the Institute where he taught history, geometry, and algebra.\n\nBraille's ear for music enabled him to become an accomplished cellist and organist in classes taught by Jean-Nicolas Marrigues. Later in life, his musical talents led him to play the organ for churches all over France. A devout Catholic, Braille held the position of organist in Paris at the Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs from 1834 to 1839, and later at the Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul.\n\nBraille was determined to invent a system of reading and writing that could bridge the gap in communication between the sighted and the blind. In his own words: \"Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us if we [the blind] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, nor do we need to be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about.\"\nIn 1821, Braille learned of a communication system devised by Captain Charles Barbier of the French Army. Some sources depict Braille learning about it from a newspaper account read to him by a friend, while others say the officer, aware of its potential, made a special visit to the school. In either case, Barbier willingly shared his invention called \"night writing\" which was a code of dots and dashes impressed into thick paper. These impressions could be interpreted entirely by the fingers, letting soldiers share information on the battlefield without having light or needing to speak. The captain's code turned out to be too complex to use in its original military form, but it inspired Braille to develop a system of his own.\n\nBraille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and his system was largely completed by 1824, when he was fifteen years old. From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the dashes because they were too difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.\n\nBraille created his own raised-dot system by using an awl, the same kind of implement which had blinded him. In the process of designing his system, he also designed an ergonomic interface for using it, based on Barbier's own slate and stylus tools. By soldering two metal strips across the slate, he created a secure area for the stylus which would keep the lines straight and readable.\n\nBy these modest means, Braille constructed a robust communication system. \"It bears the stamp of genius\" wrote Dr. Richard Slating French, former director of the California School for the Blind, \"like the Roman alphabet itself.\"\n\nThe system was soon extended to include braille musical notation. Passionate about his own music, Braille took meticulous care in its planning to ensure that the musical code would be \"flexible enough to meet the unique requirements of any instrument.\" In 1829, he published the first book about his system, \"Method of Writing Words, Music, and Plain Songs by Means of Dots, for Use by the Blind and Arranged for Them\". Ironically this book was first printed by the raised letter method of the Haüy system.\n\nBraille produced several written works about braille and as general education for the blind. \"Method of Writing Words, Music, and Plain Songs...\" (1829) was revised and republished in 1837; his mathematics guide, \"Little Synopsis of Arithmetic for Beginners\", entered use in 1838; and his monograph \"New Method for Representing by Dots the Form of Letters, Maps, Geometric Figures, Musical Symbols, etc., for Use by the Blind\" was first published in 1839. Many of Braille's original printed works remain available at the Braille birthplace museum in Coupvray.\n\n\"New Method for Representing by Dots...\" (1839) put forth Braille's plan for a new writing system with which blind people could write letters that could be read by sighted people. Called decapoint, the system combined his method of dot-punching with a new specialized grill which Braille devised to overlay the paper. When used with an associated number table (also designed by Braille and requiring memorization), the grill could permit a blind writer to faithfully reproduce the standard alphabet.\n\nAfter the introduction of decapoint, Braille gave assistance to his friend Pierre-François-Victor Foucault, who was working on the development of his Raphigraphe, a device that could emboss letters in the manner of a typewriter. Foucault's machine was hailed as a great success and was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1855.\n\nAlthough Braille was admired and respected by his pupils, his writing system was not taught at the Institute during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, who had died in 1822, showed no interest in altering the established methods of the school, and indeed, they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into braille.\n\nBraille had always been a sickly child, and his condition worsened in adulthood. A persistent respiratory illness, long believed to be tuberculosis, dogged him, and by the age of forty, he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher. Despite the lack of a cure at the time, Braille lived with the illness for 16 years. When his condition reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after he had reached the age of forty-three.\n\nThrough the overwhelming insistence of the blind pupils, Braille's system was finally adopted by the Institute in 1854, two years after his death. The system spread throughout the French-speaking world, but was slower to expand in other places. However, by the time of the first all-European conference of teachers of the blind in 1873, the cause of braille was championed by Dr. Thomas Rhodes Armitage and thereafter its international use increased rapidly. By 1882, Dr. Armitage was able to report that \"There is now probably no institution in the civilized world where braille is not used except in some of those in North America.\" Eventually even these holdouts relented: braille was officially adopted by schools for the blind in the United States in 1916, and a universal braille code for English was formalized in 1932.\n\nNew variations in braille technology continue to grow, including such innovations as braille computer terminals; RoboBraille email delivery service; and Nemeth Braille, a comprehensive system for mathematical and scientific notation. Almost two centuries after its invention, braille remains a system of powerful and enduring utility.\n\nThe immense personal legacy of Louis Braille was described in a 1952 essay by T.S. Eliot: \n\nBraille's childhood home in Coupvray is a listed historic building and houses the Louis Braille Museum. A large monument to him was erected in the town square which was itself renamed Braille Square. On the centenary of his death, his remains were moved to the Panthéon in Paris. In a symbolic gesture, Braille's hands were left in Coupvray, reverently buried near his home.\nStatues and other memorials to Louis Braille can be found around the world. He has been commemorated in postage stamps worldwide, and the asteroid 9969 Braille was named for him in 1992. The \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" lists him among the \"100 Most Influential Inventors Of All Time\".\n\nThe 200th anniversary of Braille's birth in 2009 was celebrated throughout the world by exhibitions and symposiums about his life and achievements. Among the commemorations, Belgium and Italy struck 2-euro coins, India struck a 2-rupee coin, and the USA struck a one dollar coin, all in Braille's honor.\n\nBecause of his accomplishments as a young boy, Braille holds a special place as a hero for children, and he has been the subject of a large number of works of juvenile literature. Other appearances in the arts include the American TV special \"Young Heroes: Louis Braille\" (2010); the French TV movie \"Une lumière dans la nuit\" (2008) (released in English as \"The Secret of Braille\"); and the dramatic play \"Braille: The Early Life of Louis Braille\" (1989) by Lola and Coleman Jennings. In music, Braille's life was subject of the song called \"Merci, Louis\", composed by the Halifax singer-songwriter Terry Kelly, chair of the Canadian Braille Literacy Foundation. 'The Braille Legacy', a musical which tells the story of Louis Braille, written by Sébastien Lancrenon and translated into English by Ranjit Bolt, debuted in the Charing Cross Theatre in April 2017.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Mahudel, member of the Académie des Inscriptions , presented several of those stones and showed that they have evidently been cut by the hand of man. \"An examination of them,\" he said, \"affords a proof of the efforts of our earliest ancestors to provide for their wants, and to obtain the necessaries of life.\" \n\nHe established the stone - bronze - iron sequence after he had compared several burial sites. He noticed that graves with decayed urns largely featured bronze items, whereas iron was found in more recent ones.\n\n"}

It was prevalent during feudalism.\n\nA franchise, such as a corporation, a jurisdiction, or a right to collect certain tolls or taxes, was, in effect, a kind of property: an \"incorporeal hereditament\". Under English law incorporeal hereditaments (including jurisdictions) were either granted or recognized in charters. \n\nFranchise jurisdictions included those of manorial courts, secular courts of ecclesiastical corporations (in addition to the Church's own jurisdiction over family law), borough courts of municipal corporations, merchant courts established on markets and fairs, and mining courts of mines and mining villages.\n\nIn medieval England franchises could also be established for jurisdiction over partially or entirely privatized administrative territories such as \"hundreds\" and counties. Broad jurisdictional powers were also granted to many colonial corporations (such as the East India Company). \n\nIn medieval England for many substantive areas of law the king's courts only reviewed whether the franchise courts stayed within their jurisdictional and certain procedural bounds and not the substance of the case. Generally, the only way to remove or undo the remedy of a franchise court case in royal court was to bring one of several varieties of lawsuits for trespass (tort) against the franchise court. \n\n"}

At their peak of popularity, Queen Henrietta's Men were the second leading troupe of the day, after only the King's Men.\n\nThe company was formed in 1625, at the start of the reign of King Charles I, by theatrical impresario Christopher Beeston under royal patronage of the new queen, Henrietta Maria of France. They were sometimes called the Queen's Majesty's Comedians or other variations on their name. The company was founded after an eight-month closure of the London theatres due to bubonic plague (March to October, 1625). The Lady Elizabeth's Men, then called the Queen of Bohemia's Men, had been resident at Beeston's Cockpit Theatre up to the plague closing, and provided the foundation of the new organization.\n\nTheatre manager Beeston had had several different companies acting in his Cockpit Theatre since he started it in 1617; it was with Queen Henrietta's Men that he achieved the level of success he desired. James Shirley became something like the house dramatist of the group; plays by Philip Massinger, John Ford, and Thomas Heywood were also important in their repertory. The company staged revivals along with new plays; their 1633 production of Marlowe's \"The Jew of Malta\" was a major success. They played \"The Witch of Edmonton\" early in 1636.\n\nIn their 1625–36 heyday, the company gave 66 performances at Court, for which they were paid £900.\n\nAt its start, the actors of the new company came from several different troupes then active. Richard Perkins had been with Queen Anne's Men at the Red Bull Theatre and briefly (1623–25) with the King's Men. His success as Barabas in \"The Jew of Malta\" cemented his reputation as a great tragic actor. William Robbins also came from what had been Queen Anne's Men (it was generally called the Revels company, or simply the Red Bull company, after the 1619 death of Anne of Denmark). Robbins was the company's leading comic actor through the first phase of its existence.\n\nWilliam Shearlock and Anthony Turner were other prominent members; they were holdovers from the Lady Elizabeth's company. (The new company inherited that troupe's plays as well as its actors, works like George Chapman's \"Chabot\", Massinger's \"The Renegado\", and Shirley's \"Love Tricks.\") Shearlock must have been a man of girth, since he performed the fat-man role of Lodam in Shirley's \"The Wedding\". Apart from his other roles, Turner played a kitchen maid in Part 1 of Thomas Heywood's \"The Fair Maid of the West\", one of the few cases in which a mature actor, rather than a boy player or a young man, is known to have played a female role.\n\nIn addition, the company included William Allen, Theophilus Bird (or Bourne), Hugh Clark, John Sumner, and Michael Bowyer. Bowyer handled leading-man roles; Hugh Clark was a boy player taking female roles, who later switched to adult male parts. Bird also played female roles for the company; he later married Beeston's daughter and was a successful actor both before and after the Interregnum. Allen and Sumner took significant supporting parts.\n\nSix cast lists survive from five of the company's plays: from \"The Renegado,\" \"The Wedding\", Robert Davenport's \"King John and Matilda\", Thomas Nabbes's \"Hannibal and Scipio\", and from both parts of Heywood's two-part \"Fair Maid of the West\". Two actors, Allen and Bowyer, appear on all six lists, and five more, Clark, Perkins, Shearlock, Sumner, and Turner, appear on five — arguably a good indication of their durability and importance to the troupe.\n\nAdditional personnel included:\n\n\nIn 1636 the company had a falling-out of some nature with their founder and manager, and moved to the rival Salisbury Court Theatre. Beeston had a reputation for breaking up theatre companies when it was in his interest to do so, as a way of maintaining control over recalcitrant and unruly actors; Philip Henslowe was accused of similar tactics in the previous generation. The mid-1630s was another difficult period for the theatrical profession, with a long theatre closure due to plague (May 1636 to October 1637). The Queen Henrietta's company split apart during this time; but it was reconstituted in October 1637, with veterans Perkins, Sherlock, Turner, and Sumner, at the Salisbury Court. According to his own testimony, Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, was actively involved in rebuilding the Queen Henrietta's company; he apparently had a financial interest in the Salisbury Court Theatre.\n\nThe rebuilt company retained the queen's name and patronage. On 6 March 1640, Turner collected £80 in the company's name for seven Court performances in 1638 and 1639. The company lasted until the theatres closed in September 1642 at the start of the English Civil War.\n\nThe following list includes plays acted by Queen Henrietta's Men in the years cited, and gives an indication of the nature of their repertory:\n\nNineteen of the fifty-one works on the list are the work of James Shirley, the company's house dramatist through much of its existence.\n\nThe company ended when the London theatres were closed in September 1642 at the start of the English Civil War. Some of its personnel (Anthony Turner, Michael Mohun, and Theophilus Bird are examples) resurfaced as members of the newly formed King's Company when the theatres re-opened in 1660. The King's Company also inherited a good portion of the repertory of Queen Henrietta's Men, including plays by Shirley, Brome, and Heywood.\n\n"}

He comments on Balkan politics and is a regular columnist for several conservative publications in the United States.\n\nTrifković earned a BA (Hon) in International Relations from the University of Sussex in 1977 and another, in Political Science, from the University of Zagreb in 1987. Since 1990 he has held a PhD in modern history from the University of Southampton, and in 1991-1992 he pursued post-doctoral research on a Title VIII grant from the U.S. Department of State as a Visiting Scholar at the Hoover Institution in California.\n\nBeginning in 1980, he has been a radio broadcaster for BBC World Service and Voice of America and later a correspondent covering southeast Europe for \"U.S. News & World Report\" and the \"Washington Times\" during which time he was an editor for the Belgrade magazine \"Duga\".

He has published op-eds and commentaries in \"The Times\" of London, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", the \"American Conservative\", the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\", and \"The Alternative Right\". He has been a commentator on numerous national and international TV and radio programs, including MSNBC, CNN, CNN International, Sky News, BBC Radio 4, BBC World Service and CBC.

In July 2000 he took part in a Congressional briefing organized by Rep.

In March 2003, he testified as a defense witness for Milomir Stakić at his trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Stakić was later convicted of extermination, murder and persecutions (but acquitted of genocide) and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment.\n\nIn June 2006, he was one of two dozen people who presented works at a symposium on the Holocaust in Yugoslavia, 1941–1945, co-organized by two Serbian institutions and held at Yad Vashem Center in Jerusalem. In September 2008, he testified as a defense witness for Ljubiša Beara in the Popović et al. trial. Beara was later convicted of genocide, extermination, murder, persecutions and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nIn August 2011, responding to the claim that his work inspired Norwegian murderer Anders Behring Breivik, Trifković rejected the idea that his work was a basis for the actions of this \"mentally deranged narcissistic psychopath\" any more than the \"Beatles have inspired Charles Manson.\"\n\nIn 2013 he testified on behalf of Radovan Karadžić. Trifković denied being a former spokesman for Karadžić at a time he was a journalist and analyst reporting on Karadžić's activities.\n\nHe is also professor in Faculty of Political Science of University of Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nTrifković is the author of \"Sword of the Prophet: The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam\", a book about the history and tenets of Islam which identifies the rise of Islamic fundamentalism as the greatest danger to Western values since the end of the Cold War. According to James Bissett, former Canadian Ambassador to Yugoslavia and a close associate of Trifković, Trifković sees the source of this threat in the absence of separation of church and state under Islam - because Islam is a way of life, Muslims are required to subordinate themselves to the teachings of Allah and live as members of the total Islamic community, calling into question their ability to give their political loyalty to a non-Muslim state. Trifković considers this to be a particularly important issue for the countries of Western Europe, with a population of over 50 million Muslims, and the United States (approx. 3.3 million).\n\nIn February 2011, Canadian authorities refused to allow Trifković entry into Canada to address a meeting at the University of British Columbia at Vancouver.\n\nTrifković reported in the journal \"Chronicles\" that he was refused entry to Canada on 24 February 2011 on the \"transparently spurious\" grounds that he was \"inadmissible on grounds of violating human or international rights for being a proscribed senior official in the service of a government that, in the opinion of the minister, engages or has engaged in terrorism, systematic or gross human rights violations, or genocide, a war crime or a crime against humanity within the meaning of subsections 6 (3) to (5) of the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act.\"\n\nHe claimed his \"inadmissibility\" was due to contacts with the Bosnian Serb leaders in the early 1990s but claimed that the Canadian authorities' grounds for refusing him admission were \"transparently spurious\" and they had in fact yielded to a Bosniak-inspired campaign against him. The Canadian Institute for the Research of Genocide alleged that Trifković was promoting hatred, antisemitism and Islamophobia and accused him of publicly denying what \"New American\" termed the \"alleged\" massacre of Bosniaks at Srebrenica in July 1995, found by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to be a crime of genocide.\n\n\n"}

By 1828, William Woolstenhulme had enterered the business, they had moved to the Lower Moor Ironworks and were spindle makers, iron and brass founders. The name was changed to Seville and Woolstenhulme. The business expanded and by 1846 they were employing 250 workers and were manufacturing self-acting mules and power looms. In 1854 they exhibited a 12 hp steam engine.\n\nWilliam Rye, an engineer from Manchester, entered the business in 1840 and married the senior partner's daughter in 1842. When Seville retired in 1855, Rye took the partnership. The firm became Woolstenhulme & Rye. About this time they closed the machine-making side of the business and concentrated on producing steam engines for the mills. Rye was mayor of Oldham in 1868. He was responsible for construction of Albert's Mount housing in Derker. The company was incorporated in 1873.\n\nWoolstenhulme & Rye engines are said to be conservative in design, and although Gurr & Hunt claim that there was no evidence that the company had ever used Corliss valves, in his Black Book engine list, Arthur Roberts documents their use in Parkfield Mill.

The article was penned by Oded Yinon, reputedly a former advisor to Ariel Sharon, a former senior official with the Israeli Foreign Ministry and journalist for \"The Jerusalem Post\".\n\nIt is cited as an early example of characterizing political projects in the Middle East in terms of a logic of sectarian divisions. It has played a role in both conflict resolution analysis by scholars who regard it as having influenced the formulation of policies adopted by the American administration under George W. Bush, and also in conspiracy theories according to which the article either predicted or planned major political events in the Middle East since the 1980s, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the overthrowing of Saddam Hussein, the Syrian Civil War and the rise of the Islamic State. The claim has been made that Yinon's article was adopted by members of the Institute for Zionist Strategies in the American administration until it was putatively taken up as a way to further American interests in the Middle East, as well as achieving the Jewish dream of a state \"from the brook of Egypt to the Euphrates\", encompassing the majority of the Middle East, as written in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nYinon argues that the world was witnessing a new epoch in history without precedent, which required both the development of a fresh perspective and an operational strategy to implement it. The rationalist and humanist foundations of Western civilization were in a state of collapse. The West was disintegrating before the combined onslaught of the Soviet Union and the Third World, a phenomenon he believed was accompanied by an upsurge in anti-Semitism, all of which meant that Israel would become the last safe haven for Jews to seek refuge in. The Muslim Arab world circling Israel had been arbitrarily sliced up into 19 ethnically heterogeneous states by imperial powers, France and Great Britain, and was just a 'temporary house of cards put together by foreigners' - the notion that pan-Arabism was a house of cards doomed to collapse had been already argued by Fouad Ajami some years earlier - composed of mutually hostile ethnic minorities and majorities, that, once disintegrated into, in Ahmad's interpretation, feudal tribal fiefdoms, would no longer challenge Israel. Centrifugal factors would give rise to a dynamic of fragmentation that, while highly perilous, would offer Israel opportunities it had failed to exploit in 1967.\n\nHe then proceeds to analyze the weaknesses of Arab countries, by citing what he perceives to be flaws in their national and social structures, concluding that Israel should aim to bring about the fragmentation of the Arab world into a mosaic of ethnic and confessional groupings. 'Every kind of inter-Arab confrontation,' he argued, would prove to be advantageous to Israel in the short term. He saw contemporary events in Lebanon as a foreshadowing of future developments overall throughout the Arab world. The upheavals would create a precedent for guiding Israeli short-term and long-term strategies. Specifically, he asserted that the immediate aim of policy should be the dissolution of the military capabilities of Arab states east of Israel, while the primary long-term goal should work towards the formation of unique areas defined in terms of ethnonational and religious identities.\n\nYinon thought the 1978 Camp David Accords, the peace agreement signed by Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat, to be mistaken. One of Israel's aims for the 1980s would be, Yinon claimed, the dismemberment of Egypt, a country he described as a \"corpse\", in order to reestablish the status quo ante, when Israel had controlled the Sinai Peninsula. Yinon hoped to see the formation of a Christian Coptic state on Egypt's northern borders. Yinon pinned the expectations on a rapid Israeli re-invasion of the Sinai triggered by a future rupture by Egypt of the American-brokered terms of peace, something which, under Hosni Mubarak, failed to eventuate.\n\nIn his account of Russian foreign policy and the Arabs, Yevgeny Primakov contextualizes Yinon's paper in terms of the content of what former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, George Ball, stated in testimony in August before the U.S. Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee. Ball, discussing the second Israeli invasion of Lebanon earlier in June, referred to conversations with Ariel Sharon, in which Sharon reportedly stated that his long-term strategy consisted of \"squeezing the Palestinians out of the West Bank..allowing only enough of them to remain for work.\" Yinon's paper suggested that Israeli policy, both in war and peace, should aim for one objective: 'the liquidation of Jordan' as ruled by the Hashemite Kingdom, together with increased Palestinian migration from the West Bank into eastern Jordan. The dissolution of Jordan, Yinon thought, would bring an end to the problem of the existence of dense concentrations of Palestinians in the Palestinian territories Israel had conquered in the Six-Day War in 1967, allowing them to be spirited away into that former kingdom's territory.\n\nYinon's paper fed an old Lebanese conspiracy theory against its territorial integrity going back to 1943, according to which the country was to be cantonized along ethno-nationalist lines. In particular during the 1970s the idea took wing and, especially after civil war broke out in Lebanon in 1975, came to be associated with the figure of Henry Kissinger whose Middle East diplomacy was thought to be greatly detrimental to Lebanese interests, and who was rumoured to be planning the partition of Lebanon into two states.\n\nYinon considered Iraq, with its oil wealth, to be Israel's greatest threat. He believed that the Iran–Iraq War would split up Iraq, whose dissolution should be a strategic Israeli aim, and he envisaged the emergence of three ethnic centres, of Shiites governing from Basra, the Sunni from Baghdad, and the Kurds with a capital in Mosul, each area run along the lines of the administrative divisions of the former Ottoman Empire.\n\nAn English translation by Israel Shahak soon appeared in the Journal of Palestine Studies. Israel Shahak in the foreword to his translation interpreted the plan as both a fantasy and a faithful reflection of the strategy being developed by Ariel Sharon and Rafael Eitan, and drew parallels with both the geopolitical ideas that flourished in Germany from 1890 to 1933, later adopted by Hitler and applied to Eastern Europe, and modern American neoconservative thinking, which influenced Yinon, to gather from the sources cited in his notes. It was, it has been argued, Shahak's English translation which catapulted Yinon into the public limelight.\n\nAccording to William Haddad, the publication of the article caused a sensation at the time. Haddad notes that the American syndicated columnist Joseph Kraft, a month later, echoed Yinon's ideas in an article that Syria would implode into confessional fragments composed of Alawite, Druze and Sunni communities were the country to be occupied after an Israeli invasion, and that such an event should cause reverberations throughout the Arab world, resulting in a reconfiguration of ethnic microstates guaranteed to introduce an era of peace. The idea was dismissed at the time. Yinon's article drew several other responses, and was reviewed in Newsweek (26 July 1982, p. 32) and the Wall Street Journal (8 December 1982, p. 34). Amos Elon reviewed the essay for Haaretz and worried that American commentators on Israel were turning a blind eye to the kind of irrational attitudes evinced by Yinon's article. Those who did point out such tendencies within Israeli politics were subjected to defamation. David Waines, reviewing the essay for the International Journal of Middle East Studies, contextualized it in terms of two other works appearing in the same year as Yinon's essay, a collection edited by Ibrahim Abu-Lughod and a book by Michael J. Cohen on American, British and Zionist long-term regional policies, both arguing such policies were dictated solely by a realpolitik insouciant of Palestinian grievances. In the light of the immediate instance of Israel's invasion of Lebanon in that same year, Waines concluded that all three pieces created a 'grave apprehension about present and future developpments in the Middle East.'\n\nAn article published in 1983 on the monthly publication of the Socialist Organisation in Israel, \"Matzpen\", claimed the article exposes the minds behind Israel's foreign polcy. To such claims, Yinon responded in an interview to the anti-establishment, weekly newspaper \"HaOlam HaZeh\", claiming he is not a fan or a friend of Israel's leaders at the time, including Ariel Sharon and Menachem Begin, nor does he supports them. Yinon also claimed that an article, similar to his, was published in a left-wing newspaper of the Kibbutz Movement \"Mi'Befnim\".\n\nThe French philosopher, convert to Islam, and Holocaust denier, Roger Garaudy, who was married to a Palestinian woman, used the text the following year in the English version of his book, \"L'Affaire Israël: le sionisme politique\", to support his argument that a mechanism was in place to drive Arabs out of what was defined as Eretz Israel and disintegrate Arab countries. Jordan's Prince Hassan bin Talal outlined its contents in a book on peace prospects, in 1984, as did Christine Moss Helms in a Brookings Institution study.\n\nYehoshafat Harkabi appraised Yinon's analysis of the weakness of Arab states as generally correct while expressing doubts about the suggestion Israel should actively work towards their dissolution. If their fragmentation is inevitable, he asked, why would it be necessary for Israel to interfere? Ralph Schoenman argued that its divide et īmpera principle followed 'the time-honoured imperial pattern'.\n\nMordechai Nisan, like Haddad, notes that it made waves, stirring both curiosity and wrath, the latter since it fed into regional suspicions that Israel was intent on \"balkanizing\" the neighbourhood. Nisan thought the regional outcry both exaggerated and incredulous: Yinon's apparent suggestion that Israel adopt an interventionist role to abet the fragmentation of Arab states the author thought inevitable, he added, served to create an impression that Israel was engaged in a sinister plot, when the views expressed were Yinon's alone, and did not represent Israeli government policy.\n\nIlan Peleg described it as 'an authentic mirror of the thinking mode of the Israeli Right at the height of Begin's rule.' Noam Chomsky made a more nuanced analysis of the historical context: the views espoused by Yinon were to be dissociated from the official Zionist mainstream outlook of that time, in embodying 'ideological and geopolitical fantasies' that could be identified with the line developed by the ultranationalist Tehiya political party, created in 1979. Nonetheless, an argument could be made, he continues, that part of the mainstream of Labour Zionism in his view had entertained similar ideas. Chomsky cites in support of this David Ben-Gurion's strategy when the State of Israel was founded of crushing Syria and the Transjordan, annexing southern Lebanon while leaving its northern residue to Maronite Christians, and bombing Egypt if it were to put up resistance. Chomsky warned against complacency about these fringe ideas since, he argued: '(t)he entire history of Zionism and later that of Israel, particularly since 1967, is one of gradual shift towards the positions of those formerly regarded as right-wing extremists.'\n\nVirginia Tilley argues that there was a strong tension between the US as a global hegemon relying on strong regional state systems, and Israel's interests in a weak state system in the Middle East beyond its borders on the other hand. In this context she cites Yinon's views as spelling out the latter logic, but specifies that they were not quite unique at that time, since Ze'ev Schiff writing in Haaretz in the same month, 5 February 1982, had asserted that Israel's geostrategic interests would be best served by the fragmentation of Iraq, for example, into a tripartite entity consisting of Shiite and Sunni states hived off from a northern Kurdish reality.\n\nLinda S. Heard, writing for CounterPunch in 2006, reviewed recent policies under George W. Bush such as the war on terror, and events in the Middle East from the Iran–Iraq War to the Invasion of Iraq in 2003, and concluded:\nThere is one thing that we do know. Oded Yinon's 1982 \"Zionist Plan for the Middle East\" is in large part taking shape. Is this pure coincidence? Was Yinon a gifted psychic? Perhaps! Alternatively, we in the West are victims of a long-held agenda not of our making and without doubt not in our interests.\n\nThe Canadian economist Michel Chossudovsky on his website Global Research reproduced Shahak's translation in April 2013, arguing that it threw light for the concept of a Greater Israel in the policies of the Likud-led government coalition led by Binjamin Netanyahu and circles within the Israeli military and intelligence establishment.\n\nIn 2017, Ted Becker, former Walter Meyer Professor of Law at New York University and Brian Polkinghorn, distinguished professor of Conflict Analysis and Dispute Resolution at Salisbury University, argued that Yinon's plan was adopted and refined in a 1996 policy document entitled \"\", written by a research group at the Israeli-affiliated Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies in Washington. The group was directed by Richard Perle, who, some years later, became one of the key figures in the formulation of the Iraq War strategy adopted during the administration of George W. Bush in 2003.\n\nBoth Becker and Polkinhorn admit that avowed enemies of Israel in the Middle East take the sequence of events—Israel's occupation of the West Bank, the Golan Heights, its encirclement of Gaza, the invasion of Lebanon, its bombing of Iraq, airstrikes in Syria and its attempts at containing Iran's nuclear capacities—when read in the light of the Yinon Plan and the \"Clean break\" analysis, to be proof that Israel is engaged in a modern version of The Great Game, with the backing of Zionist currents in the American neoconservative and Christian fundamentalist movements. They also conclude that Likud Party appears to have implemented both plans.\n\n\n"}
