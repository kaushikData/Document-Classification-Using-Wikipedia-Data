By 1541, Cambini's book had been reissued several times.\n\nCambini was a pupil of fellow humanist Cristoforo Landino. Since Cambini had never traveled outside Italy, he wrote his work on the Ottomans by relying on older sources from around Western Europe.\n\nCambini belonged to a group of sixteenth-century Italian historians which included Paolo Giovio and Giovanni Menavino. They openly praised the Ottoman's organization and behavior. His work sparked interest in the origin of the Ottoman dynasty. In his work, he rejected a theory that the Ottomans were descendants of the Trojans. Cambini followed the fashion of other contemporary historical works and wrote a history of the Ottomans focused on the personality of the Ottoman sultans and on the military events of their reigns.\n\nSome authors had considered the work of Christophe Richer on the Fall of Constantinople to be the account of an eyewitness (an otherwise unknown Riccherio), but it was later discovered that it was actually the work of Richer himself, who based his narration of the event on the work of several previous historians, including Cambini. Cambini's work remains a valuable source of information on the siege because his sources included the testimonies of survivors.\n\nIn 1562, John Shute translated the works of Cambini and Paolo Giovio into English and composed a tract on them (\"Two very notable commentaries: The one of the original of the Turcks and the empire of the house of Ottomanno, and the other of the warre of the Turcke against George Scanderbeg\").\n\n"}

Located in Pottawatomie County four miles southwest of Tecumseh, Brooksville was established in 1903. Originally the town was named Sewell, after a white doctor who owned much of the surrounding land and attended the residents. In 1912 the name changed to Brooksville in honor of the first African American in the area, A. R. Brooks, a cotton buyer and farmer. His son, W. M. Brooks, became the first postmaster. In 1906 Rev. Jedson White organized St. John's Baptist Church. Soon afterward, the congregation built a church that still exists. White also promoted the town throughout the South, urging African Americans to settle in Brooksville. Brooksville had a Santa Fe Railroad station, three hotels, two doctors, and two mills.\n\nIn 1924, with the aid of the Rosenwald Fund, a new school was built. Banneker School, under management of W. T. McKenzie, was a rock building of four large rooms, a three-hundred-seat auditorium, a small library, and a well-equipped domestic science room. George W. McLaurin, the first African American graduate student at the University of Oklahoma, taught at the school. After a fire, the original building was replaced by a wooden one that served students until the school closed in 1968. The building then became a community center for the town and stands next to the new city hall. A declining cotton market and the Great Depression made life difficult in Brooksville, as in many Oklahoma communities. Most of the residents departed, but the town survived. At the beginning of the twenty-first century Brooksville was steadily increasing in population.\n\nThe current mayor, Keith Davenport, is also the Presiding Bishop of A Miracle of Love Ministries and was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 2012 and 2014; as well as the Republican nominee for Oklahoma State Senate District 48 in 2005.\n\nMayor Davenport, succeeded long-time Lee Oliver who died on September 20, 2015.\n\nBrooksville is located at (35.214609, -96.969304).\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 90 people, 32 households, and 23 families residing in the town.

The racial makeup of the town was 38.89% African American, 35.56% White, 12.22% Native American, and 13.33% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.33% of the population.\n\nThere were 32 households out of which 43.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.4% were married couples living together, 12.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.1% were non-families. 28.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.81 and the average family size was 3.22.\n\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 38.9% under the age of 18, 7.8% from 18 to 24, 18.9% from 25 to 44, 18.9% from 45 to 64, and 15.6% who were 65 years of age or older.

Unlike traditional goths, Cybergoths primarily listen to electronic music more often than rock music.\n\nThe term 'Cybergoth' was coined in 1988 in Berlin, Germany by Games Workshop, for their roleplaying game \"Dark Future\", the fashion style did not emerge until a decade later. Valerie Steele quotes Julia Borden, who defines cybergoth as combining elements of industrial aesthetics with a style associated with \"Gravers\" (Gothic ravers). Gravers hybridized \"the British Raver look and the German ClubKid look with a 'freak show' spin.\" This fusion between German and Austrian styles began in 1999. Borden indicates that initially the hair extensions and bright fishnets did not mesh well with goth fashion, but that by 2002 \"the rave elements of dress were replaced by Industrial-influenced accessories, such as goggles, reflective clothing, and mostly black clothing.\" Steele summarizes:\nNancy Kilpatrick indicates that David Bowie's look in the 1970s is the initial inspiration for the style, and that Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\" provided the prototype for cyber aesthetics.\n\nCybergoth fashion combines rave, rivethead, and goth fashion, as well as drawing inspiration from other forms of science fiction. Androgyny is common. The style sometimes features one starkly contrasting bright or neon-reactive theme color, such as red, blue, neon green, chrome, or pink, set against a basic, black gothic outfit. Matte or glossy black materials such as rubber and shiny black PVC can be mixed and matched in an effort to create a more artificial look.\n\nThe black-and-monochromatic juxtaposition can take a variety of forms, including brightly colored hair and make-up, cybernetic patterns such as live LED circuit boards, body modification, gas masks and goggles (especially aviator-style), typically worn on the forehead or around the neck rather than on the eyes. The most common use of a theme color is in the hair or eye make-up. Artificial, extended hair or \"falls\" are sometimes used to create this added effect. Falls can be made of various materials, ranging from yarn to fluorescent tubing to electrical wiring. Popular club gear for cybergoths includes tight black pants, tight black vests or shirts cut from ripped, solid or fishnet fabrics, fluffies, resembling costumes from 19th Century Gothic novels or early black and white horror films from the mid-20th century. Companies that specialize in the style include Cyberdog (UK), DANE (UK), Pen & Lolly Clubwear (UK), Lip Service (US), and Diabolik (CA).\n\nCybergoth style incorporates extravagant hair pieces and styles, including synthetic dreadlocks (known as cyberlox), hair extensions and so on. These hair pieces can be made of a variety of materials, from real hair to synthetic kanekelon hair, plastic tubing, tubular crin, rubber and foam strips, belts, and are often accented with goggles.\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the instrumental, computer driven, synthesized hypnotic tempos and textures of the trance music of the late 1990s were transformed into futurepop, a term coined by Ronan Harris of the UK band VNV Nation and Stephan Groth, vocalist of Apoptygma Berzerk. Other associated music includes aggrotech, power noise and club-oriented dance music styles such as acid house, acid trance, neurofunk, synthpop, digital hardcore, gabber, hard house, hard trance, hardstyle, dark psytrance, noise music, industrial, industrial dance music, and post-industrial.\n"}

In 1992, due to the Bosnian War, he moved to the island of Korčula in Croatia where he continued primary school. He continued to live there after the war. In 1999, Markovina graduated from the gymnasium in Korčula. After that he went to study history at the University Centre for Croatian Studies in Zagreb. He graduated from the faculty in 2004. His graduation thesis was: \"ZAVNOH- Foundations and political activity\".\n\nIn December 2004, he started working at the University of Split and later he enrolled in the postgraduate studies of Croatian history at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb. He defended his master's thesis in 2009 on the subject: \"The Šibenik port in the commercial-cultural exchanges between the two Adriatic coasts in the 18th and 19th century\".\nIn 2011, Markovina defended his doctor's thesis on the subject: \"Dalmatia in the Republic of Venice reform projects during the 18th century\".\n\nWhen it comes to politics, he is regarded as a left-wing intellectual. He gained public attention in April 2013 when he started a petition for the removal of Franjo Tuđman's statue in Split. He later announced his candidacy for the council assembly at the Split local elections, 2013. He received 1.97% of the popular vote.\n\nIn December 2014, he was a guest on the national TV talk show, \"Nedjeljom u 2\", which is the most popular TV talk show in Croatia and it pushed Markovina into mainstream media. About the same time, he was informed that his contract with the University of Split was not going to be renewed so he lost his job as a university professor.\nHe was later offered a job by Milorad Pupovac to work with the archives at the Serb National Council which he accepted and then left after a few months.\n\nMarkovina is known for his opposition to the modern Croatian politics which to him originates from the 1990s. He is a fierce critic of the Franjo Tuđman regime and his modern legacy. He calls for a public recognition of the Croatian war crimes against Serbs in the Croatian War of Independence and possibly his most devoted field of engagement is the defense of the Yugoslav anti-fascist movement in World War II which is marginalised and ignored by the modern Croatia government.\nHe also supports the separation of church and state in Croatia.\n\nHe is politically engaged in his hometown of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He criticizes the Croatian administration in Mostar for dividing the city into 2 parts and for creating a nationalistic rhetoric which promotes hate between Croats and Bosniaks. He also supports the idea that the football club FK Velež Mostar should return to their original stadium. Their original stadium was stolen by the Croatian administration in 1992 and given to the football club HŠK Zrinjski Mostar.\n\nMarkovina is a very active writer. His first book from 2014, \"Between red and black\", is one of the first historical books in Croatia which focuses on the effects and disasters of the Croatian right wing government in Split and Mostar during the 1990s.\nHis third book, \"History of the defeated,\" is focused on the devastation of Yugoslavian legacy in Croatia.\n\nWhen it comes to his opinion on political party's in Croatia, he is a strong critic of both HDZ and SDP. For Markovina, HDZ is a right wing nationalist party which promotes hate and SDP is a party that betrayed social democracy.\n\nAs a teenager, Markovina was a sympathizer and friend of Stipe Šuvar and his Socialist Labour Party of Croatia in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2014, he said on a TV talk show that he is not a member of any party but he believes that the far-left Workers' Front has a perspective and that he wishes them all the best. In 2016, he began setting up his own left-wing party.\n\nMarkovina is a columnist for the national weekly newspaper \"Telegram\".\n\nOn 18 December 2016, Markovina alongside other well known intellectuals and civil activists founded the New Left Croatia, a left wing political party mostly oriented towards social democracy and anti-fascism.<ref name=\"'http://www.portalnovosti.com/\"></ref> He announced his candidacy for Mayor of Split in the 2017 local elections.

Additionally, Enos is also mentioned in Islam in the various collections of tales of the pre-Islamic prophets, which honor him in an identical manner. Furthermore, early Islamic historians like Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham always included his name in the genealogy of the Prophet Muhammad, (Arabic: \"’Anūsh\" أَنُوش or [commonly]: \"Yānish\" يَانِش).\n\nAccording to Genesis, Seth was 105 years old when Enos was born (but the Septuagint version gives 205 years), and Seth had further sons and daughters. He was the grandson of Adam and Eve (; ). According to Seder Olam Rabbah, based on Jewish reckoning, he was born in AM 235. According to the Septuagint, it was in AM 435.\n\nEnos was the father of Kenan, who was born when Enos was 90 years old (or 190 years, according to the Septuagint). According to the Bible he died at the age of 905.\n\n says: \"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh; then began men to call upon the name of the Lord\". The traditional Jewish interpretation of this verse, though, implies that it marked the beginning of idolatry, i.e. that men start dubbing \"Lord\" things that were mere creatures. This is because the previous generations, notably Adam, had already \"begun calling upon the name of the Lord\", which forces us to interpret הוחל huchal not as \"began\" but as the homonym \"profanated\". In this light, Enosh suggests the notion of a humanity (Enoshut) thinking of itself as an absolute rather than in relation to God (Enosh vs. Adam).\n\nMaimonides in Mishneh Torah Avodat Kochavim chapter 1:1-2 writes:\nDuring the times of Enosh, mankind made a great mistake, and the wise men of that generation gave thoughtless counsel. Enosh himself was one of those who erred.\nTheir mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him. Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat them with honor. [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.\nMost of the commentators agree with this view.\n\nEnos is included in the Genealogy of Jesus, according to Luke 3:23–28.\n\nAccording to the Book of Jubilees (4:11-13) in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible, Enos was born in AM 235, and \"began to call on the name of the Lord on the earth.\" He married his sister, No'am, and she bore him Kenan in the year 325 AM. Ethiopian Orthodox tradition considers him a \"faithful and righteous servant of God\", and further credits him with the introduction, following a divine revelation, of the Ge'ez alphabet in its original, consonant-only form, \"as an instrument for codifying the laws\".\n\nThe Doctrine and Covenants teaches that Enos was ordained to the Priesthood at age 134. When Adam called his posterity into the land of Adam-ondi-Ahman to give them a final blessing, Enos was one of the righteous high priests in attendance.\n\nAccording to Matthew George Easton, 19th century Scottish Presbyerian Preacher and author of Easton's Bible Dictionary, \"In his time 'men began to call upon the name of the Lord' (Gen. 4:26), meaning either (1) then began men to call themselves by the name of the Lord (marg.) i.e., to distinguish themselves thereby from idolaters; or (2) then men in some public and earnest way began to call upon the Lord, indicating a time of spiritual revival\"\n\naccording to the Book of Jubilees\nAccording to the Mandaean scriptures including the Qolastā, the Book of John and Genzā Rabbā, Enosh is cognate with the angelic soteriological figure Anush Uthra who taught John the Baptist and performed many of the same miracles within Jerusalem typically ascribed to Jesus by Christians.\n\n"}

It is concerned about crimes committed by the Imperial Japanese Army and issues related to them such as the Nanjing Massacre, Unit 731, Comfort women, Prisoners of War and Forced Labor. It aims to bring together such groups electronically, organizationally, and personally. This federation has become increasingly recognized as the leading organization safeguarding humanity and international justice with relation to World War II in Asia and the Pacific and its aftermath. It is also the first organization of its kind since previous similar groups were only focused on one or some aspects of the war.\n\nGlobal Alliance's mission focuses on bringing about the proper closure of unresolved issues arising from Japan’s aggression that led to World War II in Asia and the Pacific. It seeks justice for victims through punishment of those criminals that were either never put on trial or set free without fulfilling their sentence. Furthermore, it asks war reparations to be given to such victims that have been neglected for over five decades.\n\nBesides reparation and redress, members of Global Alliance seek to preserve and disseminate the true story of the war. Revisionist theories have focused on the denial of such massacres as the Rape of Nanjing, and the actual events that took place during the war are largely unknown in Japan and the West. To address this issue, the organization has worked towards building a memorial museum in the U.S. similar to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to preserve the truth of atrocities during World War II. Finally, Global Alliance advocates expanded coverage of World War II history in the public school textbooks, and has promoted the inclusion of material on the Asian experience of the war. Prevalent focus has been given to the European experience, which was not the only region suffering large losses during the war.\n\nThe federation believes that historical truth will bring about justice for victims and safeguard humanity from repeating the mistakes of the past.

{"id": "3467435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3467435", "title": "Khaybar", "text": "Khaybar\n\nKhaybar (, ) is the name of an oasis some to the north of Medina (ancient Yathrib), Saudi Arabia. Before the rise of Islam, this fortress town had been inhabited by Jewish tribes; it fell to Muslim forces in 629 AD.\n\nIndigenous Arabs, as well as Jews, once made up the population of Khaybar, although when Jewish settlement in northern Arabia began is unknown. In 567, Khaybar was invaded and vacated of its Jewish inhabitants by the Ghassanid Arab Christian king Al-Harith ibn Jabalah. He later freed the captives upon his return to the Levant. A brief account of the campaign is given by Ibn Qutaybah, and confirmed by the Harran Inscription. See Irfan Shahid's \"Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century\" for full details.\n\nAs late as the 7th century, Khaybar was still inhabited by Jews, who pioneered the cultivation of the oasis and made their living growing date palm trees, as well as through commerce and craftsmanship, accumulating considerable wealth. Some objects found by the Muslims when they entered Khaybar — a siege-engine, 20 bales of Yemenite cloth, and 500 cloaks — point out to an intense trade carried out by the Jews. In the past some scholars attempted to explain the siege-engine by suggesting that it was used for settling quarrels among the families of the community. Today most academics believe it was stored in a depôt for future sale, in the same way that swords, lances, shields, and other weaponry had been sold by the Jews to Arabs. Equally, the cloth and the cloaks may have been intended for sale, as it was unlikely that such a quantity of luxury goods were kept for the exclusive use of the Jews.\n\nThe oasis was divided into three regions: al-Natat, al-Shikk, and al-Katiba, probably separated by natural divisions, such as the desert, Harrat Khaybar lava drifts, and swamps. Each of these regions contained several fortresses or redoubts containing homes, storehouses and stables. Each fortress was occupied by a separate family and surrounded by cultivated fields and palm-groves. In order to improve their defensive capabilities, the settlers raised the fortresses up on hills or basalt rocks.\n\nJews continued to live in the oasis for several more years afterwards until they were finally expelled by caliph Umar. The imposition of tribute upon the conquered Jews of the Khaybar Fortress served as a precedent. Islamic law came to require exaction of tribute known as \"jizya\" from \"dhimmis\", i.e. non-Muslims under Muslim rule.\n\nFor many centuries, the oasis at Khaybar was an important caravan stopping place. The center developed around a series of ancient dams built to hold run-off water from the rain. Around the water catchments, date palms grew. Khaybar became an important date-producing center.\n\nThe Battle of Khaybar took place in May/June 628. The Jewish Banū *Naḍīr of *Medina, who claimed to be descendants of Aaron the priest, owned lands in Khaybar and had castles, fortresses, and their own weapons there. After Muhammad expelled them from Medina in 625, their leaders moved to their estates in Khaybar in order to prepare for war against Muhammad and to recruit the aid of Arab tribes. Muhammad first sent disguised guests to the homes of the leaders of Banū Naḍīr who then killed their hosts. Muhammad's victory over the Jews of Khaybar in the subsequent battle was also aided by the distance of the settlements and their castles from one another, the absence of coordination between the fighting forces, the death of the leader Sallām ibn Mishkam, and a Jew who showed the Muslims the secret entrances to one of the fortresses. The castles of Khaybar had tunnels and passages which in wartime enabled the besieged to reach water sources outside the castles. Between 16-18 Muslims were killed\nand 93 Jews. After the Muslim victory, Muhammad, concerned that Khaybar would remain desolate and would not continue supplying its agricultural produce to the Hejaz, signed an agreement with the Jews which allowed many of its inhabitants to remain on their lands, while requiring payment of half their crops to the conquerors. From a legal point of view the pact was defective, since it did not define the situation of the Jews and did not say whether they were to remain the owners of the soil which they were to cultivate. In later years Muslim jurists defined this settlement as land tenure with rent paid in produce. One version of this agreement was copied by Joseph *Sambari in the 17th century. According to Muslim sources, Muhammad returned to the Jews copies of the Torah seized during the siege, since he opposed desecrating them. After captives of war and slaves from other countries were brought to Khaybar and the people of Hejaz became more accustomed to agriculture, the caliph Omar decided to expel the Jews of Khaybar in 642 under the pretense that before his death Muhammad had commanded that two religions could not exist simultaneously in the Hejaz.\n\nIn 627 Muhammad also ordered the Expedition of Fadak to attack the Bani Sa‘d bin Bakr tribe, because Muhammad received intelligence they were planning to help the Jews of Khaybar. In this expedition 1 person was captured by Muslims, the rest of the tribe fled.\n\nDuring the reign of Caliph Umar (634-644), the Jewish community of Khaybar were transported alongside the Christian community of Najran to the newly conquered regions of Syria and Iraq; Umar also forbade non-Muslims to reside in the Hejaz for longer than three days. Since then, the Jews of Khaybar traveled around many areas throughout the Islamic Empire as artisans and merchants and maintained a distinctive identity until the 12th century.\n\nBenjamin was a Jew from Tudela in the Kingdom of Navarre. He travelled to Persia and Arabia in the 12th century. He visited and described Khaybar and neighboring Tayma some time around 1170, mentioning these places as Jewish habitations.\n\nHistorically, Khaybar is known for growing dates. The dates raised in the region were generally exported to Medina.\n\n\n"}

After graduating from Technical High School in Omaha, he attended Harvard University, financed partly by a scholarship from the \"Omaha World Herald\".\n\nHartz graduated in 1940, spent a year traveling abroad on a fellowship, and returned to Harvard as a teaching fellow in 1942. He earned his doctorate in 1946 and became a full professor of government in 1956. Hartz was known at Harvard for his talented and charismatic teaching. He retired in 1974 for ill health and spent his last years living in London, New Delhi, New York City, then Istanbul, where he died of an epileptic seizure.\n\nHartz is best known for his classic book \"The Liberal Tradition in America\" (1955), which presented a view of America's past that sought to explain its conspicuous absence of ideologies. Hartz argued that American political development occurs within the context of an enduring, underlying Lockean liberal consensus, which has shaped and narrowed the landscape of possibilities for U.S. political thought and behavior. He attributed the triumph of the liberal worldview in America to its lack of a feudal past and thus the absence of a struggle to overcome a conservative internal order, to its vast resources and open space, and to the liberal values of the original settlers, who represented only a narrow middle-class slice of European society. Hartz was chiefly concerned with explaining the failure of socialism to become established in America, and he believed that Americans' pervasive, unthinking consensual acceptance of classic liberalism was the major barrier.\n\nIn \"The Founding of New Societies\" (1964), Hartz developed the idea that the nations that developed from settler colonies were European \"fragments\" that in a sense froze the class structure and underlying ideology prevalent in the mother country at the time of their foundation and did not experience the further evolution experienced in Europe. He considered Latin America and French Canada to be fragments of feudal Europe, the United States, English Canada, and Dutch South Africa to be liberal fragments, and Australia and English South Africa to be \"radical\" fragments (incorporating the nonsocialist working class radicalism of Britain in the early 19th century).\n\nHartz led a normal life until a sudden unexplained emotional disturbance changed his entire personality in 1971. He refused all medical help. He divorced in 1972, rejected all his friends, and feuded intensely with students, faculty and administrators. In 1974 he resigned from Harvard, but his scholarly skills and interests remained strong.\n\nIn 1956, the American Political Science Association awarded Hartz its Woodrow Wilson Prize for \"The Liberal Tradition in America\", and in 1977 gave him its Lippincott Prize, designed to honor scholarly works of enduring importance. The book remains a key text in the political science graduate curriculum in American politics in universities today, in part because of the extensive, longrunning criticism and commentary that Hartz's ideas have generated. \n\nHartz's fragment thesis was disseminated and elaborated upon for the Canadian context by Gad Horowitz, in his essay \"Conservatism, Liberalism and Socialism in Canada: An Interpretation\" (1966). Horowitz's influential interpretation was still actively debated into the 21st century in Canadian political theory.\n\nIn Australia, Hartz's fragment thesis \"received respectful attention, but ... did not win assent or committed followers\", according to historian John Hirst. It was applied to early colonial history by feminist historian Miriam Dixson in \"The Real Matilda\" (1976), in which she traced gender relations in colonial New South Wales to the culture of the proletarian fragment identified by Hartz. In 1973, the \"Australian Economic History Review\" dedicated an issue to analysis of Hartz's theory.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He married Charlotte Grosse from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he worked at the University of Pennsylvania for several years.\n\nTrained as a philologist, Uhle became interested in Peru while a curator at Dresden Museum. In 1888, a close friend, Alphons Stübel, who had recently published an article on the history of Peruvian archaeology, suggested Uhle concentrate his studies on that region. He first traveled to South America in 1892 to initiate research in Argentina and Bolivia for the Konigliches Museum fur Völkerkunde in Berlin, Germany. In that same year he published \"The Ruins of Tiahuanaco in the Highlands of Ancient Peru,\" with photographer and engineer B. von Grumbkow. This extensive work is considered the first in depth scientific account of the ancient site of Tiwanaku, Bolivia.\n\nUhle returned to South America in 1896, now sponsored by the American Exploration Society in Philadelphia. He also enjoyed the patronage of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, the mother of William Randolph Hearst. He undertook excavations at Pachacamac, near the coast of Peru, and on Mochica and Chimu sites. His site report of work at Pachacamac was highly praised and is still used as a basic text for studying South American archaeology. He recognized versions of Tiwanaku stone sculpture imagery on ceramics, textiles, and other artifacts in these coastal sites. On this trip, he recovered approximately 9,000 artifacts spanning over 3,000 years of Andean pre-history. These included Nazca pottery, shells, textiles, metals, objects made of wood and other plant material, and objects constructed of animal materials such as feathers, bone, and leather. He concentrated on the dating of these artifacts, and established a system primarily based on textile design. Artifacts found in the Mocha Valley were dated based on the sequential position of Inca ceramic styles. This early dating was later advanced by American archaeologist Alfred Kroeber and is one of the key points in understanding the chronology of pre-Inca Peru. Uhle later worked in the highlands of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Chile. In 1917 he was the first to scientifically describe the Chinchorro mummies.\n\nMax Ulhe also participated in numerous paleontological excavations. In 1926, Max Uhle and paleontologist, Franz Spillmann, excavated, about 12 km. east of Quito, Ecuador, an almost complete mastodon skeleton, together with associated obsidian and bone tools and about 150 potsherds.\n\nUhle also made a notable contribution to North American archaeology in excavations of the Emeryville shell-mound in San Francisco Bay, California.

Clay tablets used in Babylonian astronomy (350–50 BC) present trapezoid procedures for computing Jupiter's position and motion and anticipate the theorem by 14 centuries.\n\nThe medieval scientists demonstrated this theorem — the foundation of \"the law of falling bodies\" — long before Galileo, who is generally credited with it.

Not a single Roma person was injured in the riot, but the material losses were substantial affecting up to 40% of residences. Many perpetrators were arrested on-site; a number of them sentenced to jail after a trial. The violence, described by foreign media as motivated by racism and jealousy, received editorial condemnation. The incident that triggered the riot was the killing of a Polish pedestrian struck along with his companion in a hit-and-run by a Romani male driver.\n\nThe immediate cause of the riot was a hit-and-run accident just before midnight on 23 June 1991 on the pedestrian crossing at Piłsudskiego and Zuzanny Morawskiej streets. A speeding luxury car driven by seventeen-year-old Roman Packowski of Romani ethnicity hit and seriously injured two young pedestrians, killing one of them. The driver fled the scene and hid from the police. He was later convinced by the Roma elders to turn himself in. Soon after the accident the local radio station informed that the driver had fled the scene. This claim was in fact true; however, the driver fled after people who witnessed the accident already identified his vehicle. For the next two days the driver and his car were hidden among the local Roma community.\n\nThe accident victim who died from his injuries was the 21-year-old Jaroslaw Pinczewski. The mayor of Mława, Adam Chmielinski informed that he died at the scene. Other victim, seventeen-year old Katarzyna Zakrzewska, suffered permanent physical incapacitation.\n\nTwo days later some sixty Mława youths targeted and destroyed the house of a local Roma leader. The assailants quickly grew in number and began burning other Roma homes. Estimates put the number of participants in the violence from one hundred to two hundred. Some Roma found protection at the local police station. Others hid at the homes of their Polish friends. A total of 17 Roma houses were seriously damaged and further 4 houses and 9 apartments were vandalized, but no members of the Roma community were hurt. The crowd apparently targeted wealthier Roma and their estates. The police brought in additional forces and imposed a curfew.\n\nA former political dissident Adam Michnik writing in \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" castigated the police and political authorities for their alleged inaction. The paper also demanded 'official action against ethnic hatred'. As a result, a number of political parties and academic institutions belatedly condemned the pogrom.\n\nThe eruption of ethnic violence at Mława in 1991 has been described as 'the renewal of anti-Gypsy racism in Poland' by hostile foreign critics; presumably linked to a significant rise in Polish Roma asylum applications in the United Kingdom and Sweden.\n\nAfterwards, 21 persons were brought to court, and 17 were sentenced for up to 30 months in prison. The President of the Roma Society of Poland, Roman Kwiatkowski informed that the relations between the local Roma and their Polish neighbours twenty years after the fact are good.\n\n"}
{"id": "2131375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2131375", "title": "New Cross house fire", "text": "New Cross house fire\n\nThe New Cross house fire was a fire that occurred during a party at a house in New Cross, south-east London, in the early hours of Sunday, 18 January 1981. The blaze killed thirteen young people aged between 14 and 22, and one survivor committed suicide two years later.\n\nNo one has ever been charged in connection to the fire, which forensic science subsequently established was started from inside the house, either by accident or deliberately.\n\nThe party was a joint birthday celebration for Yvonne Ruddock (one of the victims of the fire) and Angela Jackson (who survived) and was held at No. 439, New Cross Road. It began on the evening of Saturday, 17 January 1981 and continued throughout the night and into the early hours of Sunday.\n\nAt the time, there was a fairly high degree of racial tension in the area and far-right groups including the National Front were active locally. \n\nThere had also been some early complaints from neighbours about excessive noise from the party.\n\nA white Austin Princess was seen driving away from the fire.\n\nThe initial police suspicion was that the party had been fire-bombed, either as a revenge attack or in an attempt to stop the noise; there was also an alternative theory that a fight had broken out, from which the blaze emanated. \n\nSubsequent forensic investigation found that the fire had started in an armchair inside the front-room of the property at 5:40am on Sunday morning and police ruled out the theory that a fight had taken place.\n\nOne week after the fire, on 25 January, a meeting was held at the Moonshot Club in New Cross, attended by over one thousand people. The meeting concluded with a march to the scene of the fire and a demonstration there, which blocked New Cross Road for several hours. The New Cross Massacre Action Committee was set up and organised weekly meetings in New Cross, which saw increasing participation as the police investigation announced that there was no evidence of arson and that the fire was believed to be accidental.\n\nThe Action Committee organised a \"Black People's Day of Action\" on 2 March, when 20,000 people marched over a period of eight hours from Fordham Park to Hyde Park carrying placards including: \"Thirteen Dead and Nothing Said\", \"No Police Cover-Up\" and \"Blood Ah Go Run If Justice No Come\". One slogan read: \"Dame Jill Knight Set The Fire Alight!\" — an apparent reference to a controversial speech by Dame Jill Knight, a right-wing member of the ruling Conservative party, which was widely interpreted as condoning or even encouraging \"direct action\" against noisy parties.\n\nThe march was overwhelmingly peaceful but \"The Sun\" newspaper reported it with the headline: \"Day the blacks ran riot in London\". References in other newspapers were typically cursory mentions. None of the reports mentioned the fact that the march was cut in two at Blackfriars Bridge by police. This unexplained action created delay, confusion and frustration, and was seen as an attempt to stop the march. It also isolated the stewards and march leaders from the general public who had joined the march at the rear. Press indifference or outright hostility led to an increasing division between some elements of the black and white communities.\n\nA survivor of the fire, Anthony Berbeck, apparently committed suicide on 9 July 1983 by jumping from the balcony of a block of council flats in south London. He had been traumatised by the death of his friends in the blaze.\n\nThe inquest into the deaths of the 13 teenagers saw criticism of the police. The coroner's summary for the jury was heavily directed towards suggesting the fire was accidental, and the jury returned an open verdict which implied agreement. The victims' families challenged the procedure and while the High Court agreed that the summing-up was inaccurate, it did not overturn the verdict.\n\nIn 2002 a new action in the High Court led to an order for a second inquest, which was held in 2004, This second inquest also resulted in an open verdict.\n\nThe deaths in the fire were commemorated in a number of reggae songs and poems at the time, including Johnny Osbourne's \"13 Dead and Nothing Said\", Benjamin Zephaniah's \"13 Dead\" and Linton Kwesi Johnson's \"New Crass Massakah\".\n\nOn 14 January 2011 an event called \"Remembering the New Cross Fire 30 Years On\" was held at the Albany Theatre in Deptford. The event was hosted by Kwame Kwei-Armah and was an evening of spoken word, film, discussion and Lovers rock music. It featured contributions from Alex Pascall, Professor Gus John, filmmaker Menelik Shabazz, spoken-word artists El Crisis and Zena Edwards, novelist Courttia Newland and musicians Janet Kay and Carroll Thompson. Many of the victims' families and the survivors attended the event.\n\nSt. Andrew's church in Brockley has a strong connection with the victims as many of them attended the youth club there. In October 2002, Lewisham council installed a special stained-glass window at the church in their memory. On 16 January 2011 a memorial service was held there, with speakers including George Francis, chair of the New Cross Fire Parents' Committee; Lewisham council leader Steve Bullock; and Joan Ruddock, MP for Lewisham Deptford.\n\nThe victims were also commemorated in January 2011 with a blue plaque from Nubian Jak Community Trust. There is a stone memorial in Fordham Park, Deptford, listing those who died; facing the stone memorial is a bench with a memorial inscription. Both were installed in 2012.\n\nThere is also a memorial to the victims consisting of a park bench plus 13 trees with a plaque at either end on Hackney Downs in east London and a memorial plaque on the wall of Catford Civic Hall listing the names of the \"fourteen young people who died in the New Cross Fire of 18th January 1981\".\n\nIn 2017, the '13 Dead, Nothing Said' exhibition was hosted at Goldsmiths College, University of London. The exhibition presents a body of photographs taken by Vron Ware documenting the Black People’s Day of Action on 2 March 1981. The images bear witness to an historic moment of community organising and resistance in post-war Britain.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company flew below the radar for a while, but is fast becoming known on the New York Performance Arts scene, and being identified as uniquely Brooklyn. In fact, many are calling it a Brooklyn movement of performance artists and a haven for the aspiring actor.\n\nNYCODA was established as an annual performance festival and competition, where actors can compete in different genres, such as Shakespearean Drama, Dramatic Duologue, Humorous Verse and Open Reading. Actors compete in these categories, with the Open Reading category a favorite, because the actor has freedom to choose what to perform. In fact, many actors write and perform their own work in this category.\n\nThe NYCODA competition is typically held in the Fall of each year in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Contestants submit samples of their performances, typically monologues, via the company's website. The contestants are chosen months in advance, and are notified by the Summer preceding the Fall event. The festival is a one-day event and category winners are chosen at the end of the night and presented with some of the most sought after awards in the industry, with the biggest award, The NYCODA Actor Award going to the overall winner of the festival. The event is recorded for television purposes.\n\nWhile the NYCODA festival primarily features competing actors, many other performance artists are included. Dancers, singers and other performers help add to the rich and complex texture of the event, and now the festival is being called the Sundance Festival of Brooklyn and the buzz is already alive in the community of aspiring actors, who see the festival and competition as another outlet to have their skills recognized and an opportunity to perform live on stage in front of a large audience.\n\nMany noteworthy organizations are already in line to endorse the NYCODA movement, and to applaud it as the festival for which New York has long waited. The company has begun to develop an international outlook and has begun partnering with international agencies, in Africa and Europe. Through their international program, NYCODA welcomes actors and performance artists from all over the country and all over the world, and some NYCODA contestants have the opportunity to perform internationally as well.\n"}

He started to build a palace with gardens on the hill of Puig del rey on the south of the town, the architects were Ramon Pau, Pons Descoll, and Bernat Quer with completion in 1309.\n\nIn 1415, the Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund of Luxemburg, organised a European summit in Perpignan, to convince the Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII to resign his office and take to an end the Western Schism through the Council of Constance. On 20 September 1415, the Emperor met with Pope Benedict XIII at the palace with the King Ferdinand I of Aragon and the delegations of the Counts of Foix, Provence, Savoy, Lorraine, the embassy of the Roman church for the Council of Constance, and embassies from the Kings of France, England, Hungary, Castille and Navarre. The pope refused to resign and to recognise the Pope that the Council had chosen, clashing with the emperor who left Perpignan on 5 November.\n\nPart of the northern wing of the palace was destroyed in a siege in 1502.\nFollowing the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, France gained Roussillon, and proceed to develop the defensive features of the palace.\n\nThe General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales bought the Palace and the gardens in 1958, to the Ministry of Defence who keeps the Vauban bastions and 19th century buildings and courts as a garrison.\n\nThe Palace of the Kings of Majorca is a fortified Palace in the Gothic style. It is organised around three courtyards 60 m square. The first foremen on the site were Ramon Pau and especially Pons Descoyl, very active in Perpignan and the Baleares.\n\nIt has two chapels, one above the other: the lower is the \"Queen's Chapel\", while the upper is \"Holy Cross\" with a pink marble door.\n\nHere we have together in the “Great Hall“, the seat of political power, the chapel and the royal residence. The position of the chapel in the heart the royal apartments, opposite the throne room, indicates the importance of the spiritual over the temporal. The plan of the palace was inspired by those of Majorca, and the chapel is like that of the earlier Sainte-Chapelle in Paris.\n\nThe walls, built with uncut stones and bricks bound with mortar, were coated with lime and painted.\n\nDoors, corridors, stairs, armatures and the main towers are all made of cut stone: ochre stone from Les Fonts, Baixas Blue, Sandstone, Red Marble from Villefranche-de-Conflent, White and Blue Marble from Ceret.\n\nThe Guitares au Palais, a free three-day guitar music festival, is held in the last weekend of August in the Palace and the gardens.\n\nThe festival's art director is Pedro Soler and opens the stage to an eclectic stream of guitar enthusiasts with performances in traditional acoustic guitar, flamenco, classical music, gypsy music, pop music and jazz.\n\nInternational guests includes the Rosenberg Trio, Tekamali and Paco Ibáñez in 2004, Montserrat Figueras, Rolf Lislevand and Manolo Sanlucar in 2005, The National and Sergio Lopez in 2006, Caetano Veloso in 2007, and the Rumberos Catalans, Bernardo Sandoval, Peter Finger and Aaron and Bryce Dessner in 2008.\n\n"}

He was the eldest of four brothers, two of whom were killed in battle, and one, as a reward for service in the navy, was appointed first lieutenant of Hampton Court. Sent to England at a very early age, he was educated, first at a school kept by a Transylvanian in Great Queen Street, London, and afterwards by one Mr. Dalgarno at Oxford. In the winter of 1669 he was entered at Exeter College, Oxford, where his tutor was Narcissus Marsh; and on Marsh becoming principal of Alban Hall, Falle migrated, and graduated there M.A. in 1676.\n\nHe was ordained deacon by Ralph Brideoake, bishop of Chichester, in the following year, and priest in 1679 by Guy Carleton, who had succeeded to the see. In 1681 he was presented by Sir John Lanier, then governor of Jersey, to the living of Trinity parish in that island. The stipend was £40 per annum; but Falle had inherited a small estate by the death of his father. He also undertook the care of the garrison, which was then without a chaplain.\n\nIn 1687 Thomas Jermyn, 2nd Baron Jermyn, who had succeeded Lanier as governor, took Falle back to England as tutor to his only son; and in that occupation he remained through the Glorious Revolution, living for the most part at Rushbrooke, Lord Jermyn's country seat, near Bury St. Edmunds. In 1689 he returned to Jersey, and was translated to the charge of his native parish of St. Saviour. Meantime the battle of La Hogue had been fought, and the French navy became dispersed, but formidable in maritime depredations. The States of Jersey, of which Falle, as Rector of Saint Saviour, was a member, made an appeal to William III for protection. Taking with him Mr. Durell, the advocate-general of the island, Falle went (6 February 1693) to wait upon his majesty at Kensington. Aided by Jermyn, and favourably received by Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset, the delegates pointed out the French danger.\n\nIn January 1700 Falle became a prebendary of Durham Cathedral. In 1709 he resigned his Jersey rectorship, having been collated to the benefice of Shenley, near Barnet. Falle died at Shenley, 7 May 1742, having never married.\n\nIn 1736 he presented to his fellow-islanders his collection of books. With another donation by Canon Dumaresq (died 1805), this benefaction developed into a large library, for which the States provided a building in Saint Helier.\n\nFalle, as part of his advocacy for the defence of Jersey, wrote the first \"Account of Jersey\" (1694); in that year he was appointed royal chaplain, and preached a sermon on Queen Mary's death (20 December 1694). Around the same time Falle edited a history of the campaign of the battle of Landen in the Nine Years' War, by his friend and colleague the Edward D'Auvergne, rector of St. Brelade. His main work is based on materials from his friend Jean Poingdestre; but Falle was a poor historian.\n\nIn 1722 he contributed an account of the Channel Islands to Edmund Gibson's translation of Camden's ‘\"Britannia\",’ and in 1734 brought out an expanded edition of his \"History of Jersey\". Falle also published a few sermons.\n\n"}
{"id": "89440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89440", "title": "Philippe de Commines", "text": "Philippe de Commines\n\nPhilippe de Commines (or de Commynes or \"Philippe de Comines\"; Latin: \"Philippus Cominaeus\"; 1447 – 18 October 1511) was a writer and diplomat in the courts of Burgundy and France. He has been called \"the first truly modern writer\" (Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve) and \"the first critical and philosophical historian since classical times\" (\"Oxford Companion to English Literature\"). Neither a chronicler nor a historian in the usual sense of the word, his analyses of the contemporary political scene are what made him virtually unique in his own time.\n\nCommines was born at Renescure (in what was then the county of Flanders), to an outwardly wealthy family. His parents were Colard van den Clyte (or \"de La Clyte\") and Marguerite d'Armuyden. In addition to being \"seigneur\" of Renescure, Watten and Saint-Venant, Clyte became bailiff of Flanders for the Duke of Burgundy in 1436, and had been taken prisoner at the Battle of Agincourt. Philippe took his surname from a \"seigneurie\" on the Lys which had belonged to the family of his paternal grandmother, Jeanne de Waziers. His paternal grandfather, also named Colard van den Clyte (d. 1404), had been governor first of Cassel and then of Lille. However, the death of Commines' father in 1453 left him the orphaned owner of an estate saddled with enormous debts. In his teens he was taken into the care of Philip the Good (1419–1467), Duke of Burgundy, who was his godfather. He fought at the Battle of Montlhéry in 1465 and the Battle of Brusthem in 1467 but in general seems to have kept a low profile.\n\nIn 1468, he became a knight in the household of Charles the Bold, Philip's son who succeeded to the dukedom in 1467, and thereafter he moved in the most exalted circles, being party to many important decisions and present at history-making events. A key event in Commines's life seems to have been the meeting between Charles and Louis XI of France at Péronne in October 1468. Although Commines's own account skates over the details, it is apparent from other contemporary sources that Louis believed Commines had saved his life. This may explain Louis's later enthusiasm in wooing him away from the Burgundians.\n\nIn 1470 Commines was sent on an embassy to Calais, then an English possession. It is unlikely that he ever visited England itself, what he knew of its politics and personalities coming mostly from meetings with exiles, both Yorkist and Lancastrian; these included Henry Tudor and Warwick the Kingmaker. He also met King Edward IV of England during the latter's continental exile and later wrote a description of his appearance and character.\n\nCommines was a great favorite with Duke Charles for seven years (going back to when he had still been Count of Charolais). The 19th-century scholar Isaac D'Israeli, recounts that one day, when they came home from hunting and were joking around as was their wont within the \"family\", Commines \"ordered\" the prince to remove Commines's boots as if he were a servant; laughing, the prince did so but then tossed the boot at Commines, and it bloodied his nose. Everyone in the Burgundian court started calling Commines \"booted head\". D'Israeli, in his 1824 \"Curiosities of Literature\", suggests that Commines's hatred for the duke of Burgundy poisoned everything he wrote about him, but comments:\n\"When we are versed in the history of the times, we often discover that memoir-writers have some secret poison in their hearts. Many, like Comines, have had the boot dashed on their nose. Personal rancour wonderfully enlivens the style... Memoirs are often dictated by its fiercest spirit; and then histories are composed from memoirs. Where is TRUTH? Not always in histories and memoirs!\"\n\nD'Israeli says Commines so resented his nickname that it was the reason he suddenly left Burgundy and went into the service of the French king, but the financial incentives offered by Louis provide a more than adequate explanation: Commines was still heavily burdened with his father's debts. He fled by night from Normandy on 7 August 1472, and joined Louis near Angers. On the following morning, when Duke Charles discovered his servant and god-brother missing, he confiscated all of Commines' property. These were later given to Philip I of Croÿ-Chimay.\n\nLouis was generous in making up for those losses. On 27 January 1473 the king wed him to a Poitevin heiress, Hélène de Chambes (d.1532), \"dame\" of the \"seigneuries\" of Argenton, Varennes, and Maison-Rouge. When Hélène's sister, Colette de Chambes, was believed to have been poisoned by her aged husband Louis d'Amboise, Viscount of Thouars, in a fit of jealousy over her affair with Charles de Valois, Louis XI's brother, the king had confiscated most of his properties. Some of these he later gave to Commines for life, including the Princedom of Talmond in Poitou, and the \"seigneuries\" of Berrie, Sables, and Olonne. Despite later reverses in the family's fortunes, on 13 August 1504 their only child, Jeanne de Commines (d.1513), made a splendid marriage to the heir of Brittany's most powerful family, René de Brosse comte de Penthièvre (d.1524). Through her descendants, Commines would become the ancestor of Jean, duc de Chevreuse, of the Gouffier \"ducs de Roannais\", and of Louis XV, while Jeanne herself became the mother-in-law of Anne, duchesse d'Étampes, \"maîtresse-en-titre\" to King Francis I of France.\n\nAs a long-time enemy of Burgundy, Louis no doubt valued the inside information Commines was able to provide, and Commines quickly became one of the king's most trusted advisers. Jean Dufournet's 1966 study of Commines has shown that the next five years, up to 1477, were the most prosperous from Commines's point of view, and the only ones when he truly had Louis's confidence. After Charles the Bold's death in 1477, the two men openly disagreed about how best to take political advantage of the situation. Commines himself admitted associating with some of the king's most prominent opponents and referred to another incident, in May 1478, when Louis reprimanded him for allegedly being open to bribery. Thereafter, much of his diplomatic work was done in the Italian arena, and he came into contact with Lorenzo de Medici on several occasions.\n\nWhen Louis began to suffer ill-health, Commines was apparently welcomed back into the fold and performed personal services for the king. Many of his activities during the period seem to have involved a degree of secrecy; he was effectively acting as a kind of undercover agent. However, he never regained the level of intimacy with the king that he had previously enjoyed, and Louis's death in 1483, when Commines was still only in his thirties, left him without many friends at court. Nevertheless, he retained a place on the royal council until 1485. Then, having been implicated in the Orleanist rebellion, he was taken prisoner and kept in confinement for over two years, from January 1487 until March 1489. For some of that period, he was kept in an iron cage.\n\nAfter his release, Commines was exiled to his estate at Dreux, where he began to write his \"Mémoires\". (This title was not used until an edition of 1552.) By 1490, however, he was recovering his position at court and was in the service of King Charles VIII of France. Charles never allowed him the privileged position he had held under Louis, and he was once again used as an envoy to the Italian states. However, his personal affairs were still problematic, and his right to some of the possessions given him by Louis was subject to legal challenges.\n\nIn 1498 (fifteen years after the death of Louis XI of France), Commines's work was completed (first published in 1524 in Paris), and is considered a historical record of immense importance, largely because of its author's cynical and forthright attitude to the events and machinations he had witnessed. His writings reveal many of the less savory aspects of the reign of Louis XI, and Commines related them without apology, insisting that the late king's virtues outweighed his vices. He is regarded as a major primary source for 15th century European history.\n\nThe \"Mémoires\" are divided into \"books\", the first six of which were written between 1488 and 1494, and relate the course of events from the beginning of Commines' career (1464) up to the death of King Louis. The remaining two books were written between 1497 and 1501 (printed in 1528), and deal with the Italian wars, ending in the death of King Charles VIII of France.\nCommines' scepticism is summed up in his own words: \"Car ceux qui gagnent en ont toujours l'honneur\" (\"For the honours always go to the winners\"). Some have disputed whether his candid phrases disguise a deeper dishonesty. Yet at no time does he attempt to present himself as a hero, even when recounting his military career. His attitude to politics is one of pragmatism, and his ideas are practical and progressive. His reflections on the events he has witnessed are profound by comparison with those of Froissart, who lived a century earlier. His psychological insights into the behaviour of kings are ahead of their time, reminiscent in some ways of his contemporary, Niccolò Machiavelli. Like Machiavelli, Commines aims to instruct the reader in statecraft, though from a slightly different viewpoint. In particular, he notes how Louis repeatedly got the better of the English, not by military might, but by political machination.\n\n\n\n \n"}

After work and military service and escape from imprisonment by English forces, in 1945 he began studies at the University of Hamburg, majoring in pre- and protohistory under Hans Jürgen Eggers with minor studies in classical antiquity, German medieval studies, folkloristics, ethnology and geography. After seven semesters in mid-1949 he received his doctoral degree with a thesis titled \"\"Untersuchungen zur Eisenzeit in Mitteldeutschland\" (\"Investigations of the Iron Age in Central Germany\")\". From 1952-1953, he received a travel stipend from the German Archaeological Institute.\n\nAfter habilitation in 1955, he was a \"Privatdozent\" for pre- and protohistory at the University of Hamburg.

He authored important works on topics which included the bronze age in central Europe and the archaeology and history of Germanic peoples. In 1962 together with Georg Kossack and philologist Hans Kuhn he published a study on the \"Nordwestblock\" (\"Völker zwischen Germanen und Kelten\") and in 1970 investigated the origins of the Goths and their presumed original homeland in Scandinavia. He continued his work after becoming an emeritus professor at the university. In 1991, he published his studies on the origin and creation of the Gundestrup cauldron. The excavation results from Kamid al lawz were published in more than 20 volumes under his direction in the series \"Saarbrücker Beiträge zur Altertumskunde\". Those whose doctorates he supervised include the former director of antiquities for the Saarland, Alfons Kolling, the mining archaeologist Gerd Weisgerber and François Bertemes, professor of prehistoric archaeology at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg.\n\nHachmann is a regular member of the German Archaeological Institute and was also an honorary member of the Romanian Academy from 1993.

{"id": "27113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27113", "title": "Secularism", "text": "Secularism\n\nSecularism, as defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, is the \"indifference to, or rejection or exclusion of, religion and religious considerations.\" As a philosophy, secularism seeks to interpret life on principles taken solely from the material world, without recourse to religion. In political terms, secularism is the principle of the separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institution and religious dignitaries (the attainment of such is termed secularity). Under a brief definition, Secularism means that governments should remain neutral on the matter of religion and should not enforce nor prohibit the free exercise of religion, leaving religious choice to the liberty of the people. One manifestation of secularism is asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings, or, in a state declared to be neutral on matters of belief, from the imposition by government of religion or religious practices upon its people. Another manifestation of secularism is the view that public activities and decisions, especially political ones, should be uninfluenced by religious beliefs or practices.\n\nSecularism draws its intellectual roots from Greek and Roman philosophers such as Zeno of Citium and Marcus Aurelius; from Enlightenment thinkers such as Erasmus, John Locke, Denis Diderot, Voltaire, Baruch Spinoza, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine; and from more recent freethinkers and atheists such as Robert Ingersoll, Bertrand Russell, and Christopher Hitchens. It shifts the focus from religion to other ‘temporal’ and ‘this-worldly’ things with emphasis on nature, reason, science, and development.\n\nThe purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely. In European laicism, it has been argued that secularism is a movement toward modernization, and away from traditional religious values (also known as secularization). This type of secularism, on a social or philosophical level, has often occurred while maintaining an official state church or other state support of religion. In the United States, some argue that state secularism has served to a greater extent to protect religion and the religious from governmental interference, while secularism on a social level is less prevalent.\n\nOn the other hand, Meiji era Japan maintained that it was secular and allowed freedom of religion despite enforcing State Shinto and continuing to prohibit certain \"superstitions;\" scholar of religion Jason Ānanda Josephson has labelled this conception of the secular \"the Shinto Secular\" and noted that it follows a pattern established in certain European constitutions.\n\nThe term \"secularism\" was first used by the British writer George Jacob Holyoake in 1851. Holyoake invented the term secularism to describe his views of promoting a social order separate from religion, without actively dismissing or criticizing religious belief. An agnostic himself, Holyoake argued that \"Secularism is not an argument against Christianity, it is one independent of it. It does not question the pretensions of Christianity; it advances others. Secularism does not say there is no light or guidance elsewhere, but maintains that there is light and guidance in secular truth, whose conditions and sanctions exist independently, and act forever. Secular knowledge is manifestly that kind of knowledge which is founded in this life, which relates to the conduct of this life, conduces to the welfare of this life, and is capable of being tested by the experience of this life.\"\n\nBarry Kosmin of the Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture breaks modern secularism into two types: hard and soft secularism. According to Kosmin, \"the hard secularist considers religious propositions to be epistemologically illegitimate, warranted by neither reason nor experience.\" However, in the view of soft secularism, \"the attainment of absolute truth was impossible and therefore skepticism and tolerance should be the principle and overriding values in the discussion of science and religion.\"\n\nThe departure from reliance on religious faith to reason and science marks the beginning of the secularization of education and society in history. Among the earliest documentations of a secular form of thought is seen in the Charvaka system of philosophy, which held direct perception, empiricism, and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge, and sought to reject the prevailing religious practices of that time. According to Domenic Marbaniang, Secularism emerged in the West with the establishment of reason over religious faith as human reason was gradually liberated from unquestioned subjection to the dominion of religion and superstition. Secularism first appeared in the West in the classical philosophy and politics of ancient Greece, disappeared for a time after the fall of Greece, but resurfaced after a millennium and half in the Renaissance and the Reformation. He writes:\nAn increasing confidence in human capabilities, reason, and progress, that emerged during the Italian Renaissance, together with an increasing distrust in organized and state supported religion during the Reformation, was responsible for the ushering of modernity during the Enlightenment, which brought all facets of human life including religion under the purview of reason and thus became responsible for the freeing of education, society, and state from the domination of religion; in other words, the development of modern secularism.\nHarvey Cox explains that the Enlightenment hailed Nature as the \"deep reality\" that transcended the corrupted man-made institutions of men. Consequently, the rights of man were not considered as God-given but as the de facto benefits of Nature as revealed by Reason.\n\nIn political terms, secularism is a movement towards the separation of religion and government (often termed the separation of church and state). This can refer to reducing ties between a government and a state religion, replacing laws based on scripture (such as Halakha, Dominionism, and Sharia law) with civil laws, and eliminating discrimination on the basis of religion. This is said to add to democracy by protecting the rights of religious minorities.\n\nIn his \"On Temporal Authority (1523),\" Martin Luther argued for the division of the church and the state. He specified two distinct powers: \"weltliches Regiment\" (German word for ‘the kingdom of the world,’ ‘the State’) and \"geistliches Regiment\" (German word for ‘the kingdom of God,’ ‘the Church’) and argued that citizens need only subject to the ruler's edict as long as the edict conformed to God's divine will as revealed in the scriptures.\n\nScholars, such as Jacques Berlinerblau of the Program for Jewish Civilization at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, have argued that the separation of church and state is but one possible strategy to be deployed by secular governments. What all secular governments, from the democratic to the authoritarian, share is a concern about the relationship between the church and the state. Each secular government may find its own unique policy prescriptions for dealing with that concern (separation being one of those possible policies; French models, in which the state carefully monitors and regulates the church, being another).\n\nA major impact on the idea of state religious liberty came from the writings of John Locke who, in his A Letter Concerning Toleration argued in favor of religious toleration. He argued that government must treat all citizens and all religions equally and that it can restrict actions but not the religious intent behind them.\n\nMaharaja Ranjeet Singh of the Sikh empire of the first half of the 19th century successfully established a secular rule in the Punjab. This secular rule respected members of all races and religions and it allowed them to participate without discrimination in Ranjeet Singh's darbar and he had Sikh, Muslim and Hindu representatives heading the darbar. Ranjit Singh also extensively funded education, religion, and arts of various different religions and languages.\n\nSecularism is most often associated with the Age of Enlightenment in Europe and it plays a major role in Western society. The principles, but not necessarily the practices, of separation of church and state in the United States and \"Laïcité\" in France draw heavily on secularism. Secular states also existed in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages (see Islam and secularism).\n\nDue in part to the belief in the separation of church and state, secularists tend to prefer that politicians make decisions for secular rather than religious reasons. In this respect, policy decisions pertaining to topics like abortion, contraception, embryonic stem cell research, same-sex marriage, and sex education are prominently focused upon by American secularist organizations such as the Center for Inquiry.\n\nSome Christian fundamentalists and scholars (notably in the United States) oppose secularism, often claiming that there is a \"radical secularist\" ideology being adopted in our current day and they see secularism as a threat to \"Christian rights\" and national security. This could be a sign that ‘hard secularism’ is taking over from ‘soft secularism’ towards becoming the predominant ideological mindset. According to the terminologi of Barry Kosmin, described earlier in this article.\n\nThe most significant forces of religious fundamentalism in the contemporary world are Christian fundamentalism and Islamic fundamentalism. At the same time, one significant stream of secularism has come from religious minorities who see governmental and political secularism as integral to the preservation of equal rights.\n\nSome of the well known states that are often considered \"constitutionally secular\" are the United States, France, Mexico South Korea, and Turkey although none of these nations have identical forms of governance with respect to religion.\n\nCountries with state religion in northern Europe have a high degree of political secularism with systems build upon Protestant and democratic ideology. For example, the monarchy of Denmark have a constitutional right for the freedom of religion, freedom of speech and it is illegal to discriminate individually upon religion, ethnic origins etc.\n\nOne of the most wellknown countries with a religious political system is the Islamic republic of Iran.\n\nIn studies of religion, modern democracies are generally recognized as secular. This is due to the near-complete freedom of religion (beliefs on religion generally are not subject to legal or social sanctions), and the lack of authority of religious leaders over political decisions. Nevertheless, it has been claimed that surveys done by Pew Research Center show Americans as generally being more comfortable with religion playing a major role in public life, while in Europe the impact of the church on public life is declining.\n\nModern sociology has, since Max Weber, often been preoccupied with the problem of authority in secularized societies and with secularization as a sociological or historical process. Twentieth-century scholars, whose work has contributed to the understanding of these matters, include Carl L. Becker, Karl Löwith, Hans Blumenberg, M. H. Abrams, Peter L. Berger, Paul Bénichou and D. L. Munby, among others.\n\nSome societies become increasingly secular as the result of social processes, rather than through the actions of a dedicated secular movement; this process is known as secularization.\n\nSociologist Peter L. Berger maintained that the modern world can no longer be described as being secular or becoming increasingly secular, instead it can best be described as being pluralistic.\n\nGeorge Holyoake's 1896 publication \"English Secularism\" describes secularism as follows:\n\nSecularism is a code of duty pertaining to this life, founded on considerations purely human, and intended mainly for those who find theology indefinite or inadequate, unreliable or unbelievable. Its essential principles are three: (1) The improvement of this life by material means. (2) That science is the available Providence of man. (3) That it is good to do good. Whether there be other good or not, the good of the present life is good, and it is good to seek that good.\n\nHolyoake held that secularism and secular ethics should take no interest at all in religious questions (as they were irrelevant), and was thus to be distinguished from strong freethought and atheism. In this he disagreed with Charles Bradlaugh, and the disagreement split the secularist movement between those who argued that anti-religious movements and activism was not necessary or desirable and those who argued that it was.\n\nContemporary ethical debate in the West is often described as \"secular.\" The work of well known moral philosophers such as Derek Parfit and Peter Singer, and even the whole field of contemporary bioethics, have been described as explicitly secular or non-religious.\n\nIt has been argued that the concept of secularism has frequently been misinterpreted. In a July 2012 \"Huffington Post\" article titled \"Secularism Is Not Atheism\", Jacques Berlinerblau, Director of the Program for Jewish Civilization at Georgetown University, wrote that \"Secularism must be the most misunderstood and mangled ism in the American political lexicon. Commentators on the right and the left routinely equate it with Stalinism, Nazism and Socialism, among other dreaded isms. In the United States, of late, another false equation has emerged. That would be the groundless association of secularism with atheism. The religious right has profitably promulgated this misconception at least since the 1970s.\"\n\nIt can be seen by many of the organizations (NGO's) for secularism that they prefer to define \"secularism\" as the common ground for all life stance groups, religious or atheistic, to thrive in a society that honors freedom of speech and conscience. An example of that is the National Secular Society in the UK. This is a common understanding of what secularism stands for among many of its activists throughout the world. However, many scholars of Christianity and conservative politicians seem to interpret secularism more often than not, as an antithesis of religion and an attempt to push religion out of society and replace it with atheism or a void of values, nihilism. This dual aspect (as noted above in \"Secular ethics\") has created difficulties in political discourse on the subject. It seems that most political theorists in philosophy following the landmark work of John Rawl´s \"Theory of Justice\" in 1971 and its following book, \"Political Liberalism\" (1993), would rather use the conjoined concept \"overlapping consensus\" rather than secularism. In the latter Rawls holds the idea of an overlapping consensus as one of three main ideas of political liberalism. He argues that the term \"secularism\" cannot apply; But what is a secular argument? Some think of any argument that is reflective and critical, publicly intelligible and rational, as a secular argument; [...], Nevertheless, a central feature of political liberalism is that it views all such arguments the same way it views religious ones, and therefore these secular philosophical doctrines do not provide public reasons. Secular concepts and reasoning of this kind belong to first philosophy and moral doctrine, and fall outside the domain of the political.Still, Rawl´s theory is akin to Holyoake´s vision of a tolerant democracy that treats all life stance groups alike. Rawl´s idea it that it is in everybody´s own interest to endorse \"a reasonable constitutional democracy\" with \"principles of toleration\". His work has been highly influential on scholars in political philosophy and his term, \"overlapping consensus\", seems to have for many parts replaced \"secularism\" among them. In textbooks on modern political philosophy, like Colin Farelly´s, \"An Introduction to Contemporary Political Theory\", and Will Kymlicka´s, \"Contemporary Political Philosophy\", the term secularism is not even indexed and in the former it can be seen only in one footnote. However, there is no shortage of discussion and coverage of the topic it involves. It is just called \"overlapping consensus, pluralism\", \"multiculturalism\" or expressed in some other way. In The \"Oxford Handbook of Political Theory\", there is one chapter called \"Political secularism\", by Rajeev Bhargava. It covers secularism in a global context and starts with this sentence: \"Secularism is a beleaguered doctrine.\"\n\nGroups such as the National Secular Society (United Kingdom) and Americans United campaign for secularism are often supported by Humanists. In 2005, the National Secular Society held the inaugural \"Secularist of the Year\" awards ceremony. The award's first winner was Maryam Namazie, of the Worker-Communist Party of Iran and the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain which aims to break the taboo that comes with renouncing Islam and to oppose apostasy laws and political Islam.\n\nThe Scottish Secular Society is active in Scotland and is currently focused on the role of religion in education. In 2013 it raised a petition at the Scottish Parliament to have the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 changed so that parents will have to make a positive choice to opt into Religious Observance.\n\nAnother secularist organization is the Secular Coalition for America. The Secular Coalition for America lobbies and advocates for separation of church and state as well as the acceptance and inclusion of Secular Americans in American life and public policy. While Secular Coalition for America is linked to many secular humanistic organizations and many secular humanists support it, as with the Secular Society, some non-humanists support it.\n\nLocal organizations work to raise the profile of secularism in their communities and tend to include secularists, freethinkers, atheists, agnostics, and humanists under their organizational umbrella.\n\nStudent organizations, such as the Toronto Secular Alliance, try to popularize nontheism and secularism on campus. The Secular Student Alliance is an educational nonprofit that organizes and aids such high school and college secular student groups.\n\nIn Turkey, the most prominent and active secularist organization is Atatürkist Thought Association (ADD), which is credited for organizing the Republic Protests – demonstrations in the four largest cities in Turkey in 2007, where over 2 million people, mostly women, defended their concern in and support of secularist principles introduced by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.\n\nLeicester Secular Society founded in 1851 is the world's oldest secular society.\n\n\"See also the references list in the article on secularization\"\n\n\n"}

It passed through the Petit Ballon and Grand Ballon before reaching Le Vieil Armand (Hartmannswillerkopf) and passing a line through Thann and Cernay. It then ran its course to Altkirch and the Sundgau and the Swiss border.\n\nWhile Alsace comprises the \"départements\" of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin the front line just ran through the Haut-Rhin.\n\nThe fighting in this area in the 1914-1918 war can be divided into\n\n\nWe are dealing with a front line that starts to the south of St Die des Vosges and runs right down to the Swiss border. We shall cover the German cemetery south of Saulcy-sur-Meurthe, La Croix aux Mines, the Col du Bonhomme and the town of La Bonhomme as well as the French National cemetery at Duchesne. Next we will identify memorials and cemeteries in the area to the north and south of Orbey and the valley of Orbey. This will cover the Linge area, the memorial of Linge and the battle fought there, as well as covering memorials or cemeteries at Lapoutrie, Labaroche and Hohrod. We shall then deal with Munster and the area south of Munster and then the Hohneck peak and the Petit Hohneck. . We shall then look at the Grand Ballon and the Petit Ballon before proceeding to Guebwiller, Soultz, Moosch and Hartmannswiller finally dealing with Cernay, Thann, Altkirch and the Swiss border town of Pfetterhouse.\n\nMunster itself and all the villages in the Munster valley were subjected to artillery bombardments. One such was Metzeral and here in 1915 there was some fierce fighting in June 1915. General Pouydraguin of the 47th French Infantry joined with General Serret and his 66th French Infantry in an offensive.\nOn 9 June the population of Metzeral and Sondernach were evacuated and the French attack started on 15 June and on the 20th and 21st Metzeral was attacked with the fighting taking place in the village itself. Metzeral and the Fecht valley were now in ruins but the French offensive had failed. One month later the fighting would start at Linge.\n\nAfter the end of 1915 fighting in the Vosges was less intense but the various cemeteries scattered around the area bear witness to the great loss of life. One such cemetery is known as the \"Chêne Millet\" and holds the remains of 2,632 Frenchmen. It is located between Metzeral and Mittach..\n\nThe Route des Crêtes or \"Road of the Ridges\" was a major construction in the region ordered by Joffre and finished in the summer of 1915. It ran from the Col du Bonhomme in the north to the Hartmannswillerkopf in the south and was built to facilitate the delivery of supplies to the French troops on the passes and mountains they held, as well, of course, as moving the soldiers themselves when it was necessary to bolster forces in any given area.\n\nFrom Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines the Route des Crêtes runs down to the Col du Bonhomme on the route connecting Saint-Dié-des-Vosges and Colmar. The route continues south via the Col de Louchbach to the Col de Calvaire where it enters the department of Vosges. The route then passes the Gazon du Faing from where there is a panoramic view stretching to the Black Forest across the Rhine valley in Germany and the Hohneck, Petit Ballon and Grand Ballon summits in the Vosges mountains. From here the road then crosses the Col de la Schlucht a pass which connects Gérardmer with Colmar. The road then passes the Hohneck mountain. After passing the Kastelberg, Rainkopf and Rotherbachkopf peaks the road returns to the Haut-Rhin department before it crosses the Cols du Herrenberg and Hahnenbrunnen then reaching Le Markstein. The road now reaches its highest point at the Col du Grand Ballon before passing the Col Amic on the descent to Cernay and passing Hartmannswillerkopf.\n\n\n"}
