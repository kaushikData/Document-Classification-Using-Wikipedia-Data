The Dust Bowl (which gives the nickname the Dirty Thirties) in the United States further emphasised the scarcity of wealth. Herbert Hoover worsened the situation with his failed attempt to balance the budget by raising taxes. Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected, as a response, in 1933, and introduced the New Deal. The founding of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the funding of numerous projects (e.g. the Hoover Dam) helped restore prosperity in the US.\n\nMeanwhile, authoritarian regimes emerged in several countries in Europe and South America, in particular the Third Reich in Germany. Germany elected Adolf Hitler, who imposed the Nuremberg Laws, a series of laws which discriminated against Jews and other ethnic minorities. Weaker states such as Ethiopia, China, and Poland were invaded by expansionist world powers, the last of these attacks leading to the outbreak of the World War II on September 1, 1939, despite calls from the League of Nations for worldwide peace. World War II helped end the Great Depression when governments spent money for the war effort. The 1930s also saw a proliferation of new technologies, especially in the fields of intercontinental aviation, radio, and film.\n\n\n\nThe rise of Nazism\n\n\nUnited States\nSaudi Arabia\nSpain\n\n\n\n\n\nHertzog of South Africa, whose National Party had won the 1929 election alone, after splitting with the Labour Party, received much of the blame for the devastating economic impact of the depression.\n\n\n\n\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\n\n\nMany technological advances occurred in the 1930s, including:\n\n\nIn the art of film making, the Golden Age of Hollywood entered a whole decade, after the advent of talking pictures (\"talkies\") in 1927 and full-color films in 1930: more than 50 classic films were made in the 1930s:\nmost notable were \"Gone With The Wind\" and \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\nIn 1930, Howard Hughes produces Hell's Angels (film), the first movie blockbuster to be produced outside of a professional studio, independently, as well as becoming the most expensive movie made, at that time, costing roughly 4 million dollars, and taking four years to make. Hell's Angels was an epic masterpiece, valued, and relative to the people at those specific times, of harsh war.\n\n\n\nThe most characteristic North American fashion trend from the 1930s to 1945 was attention at the shoulder, with butterfly sleeves and banjo sleeves, and exaggerated shoulder pads for both men and women by the 1940s. The period also saw the first widespread use of man-made fibers, especially rayon for dresses and viscose for linings and lingerie, and synthetic nylon stockings. The zipper became widely used. These essentially U.S. developments were echoed, in varying degrees, in Britain and Europe. Suntans (called at the time \"sunburns\") became fashionable in the early 1930s, along with travel to the resorts along the Mediterranean, in the Bahamas, and on the east coast of Florida where one can acquire a tan, leading to new categories of clothes: white dinner jackets for men and beach pajamas, halter tops, and bare midriffs for women.\n\nFashion trendsetters in the period included The Prince of Wales (King Edward VIII from January 1936 until his abdication that December) and his companion Wallis Simpson (the Duke and Duchess of Windsor from their marriage in June 1937), socialites like Nicolas de Gunzburg, Daisy Fellowes and Mona von Bismarck and such Hollywood movie stars as Fred Astaire, Carole Lombard and Joan Crawford.\n\nSocial Realism became an important art movement during the Great Depression in the United States in the 1930s. Social realism generally portrayed imagery with socio-political meaning. Other related American artistic movements of the 1930s were American scene painting and Regionalism which were generally depictions of rural America, and historical images drawn from American history. Precisionism with its depictions of industrial America was also a popular art movement during the 1930s in the USA. During the Great Depression the art of photography played an important role in the Social Realist movement. The work of Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, Margaret Bourke-White, Lewis Hine, Edward Steichen, Gordon Parks, Arthur Rothstein, Marion Post Wolcott, Doris Ulmann, Berenice Abbott, Aaron Siskind, Russell Lee, Ben Shahn (as a photographer) among several others were particularly influential.\n\nThe Works Progress Administration part of the Roosevelt Administration's New Deal sponsored the Federal Art Project, the Public Works of Art Project, and the Section of Painting and Sculpture which employed many American artists and helped them to make a living during the Great Depression.\n\nMexican muralism was a Mexican art movement that took place primarily in the 1930s. The movement stands out historically because of its political undertones, the majority of which of a Marxist nature, or related to a social and political situation of post-revolutionary Mexico. Also in Latin America Symbolism and Magic Realism were important movements.\n\nIn Europe during the 1930s and the Great Depression, Surrealism, late Cubism, the Bauhaus, De Stijl, Dada, German Expressionism, Symbolist and modernist painting in various guises characterized the art scene in Paris and elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nProminent criminals of the Great Depression:\n\n\nThe following articles contain brief timelines which list the most prominent events of the decade:\n\n1930 • 1931 • 1932 • 1933 • 1934 • 1935 • 1936 • 1937 • 1938 • 1939\n\n"}

The goal of the organization was described by Ashton Hawkins as \"informing the public on arts issues.\" The organization is now defunct and its website (culturalpolicycouncil.org) has been removed from the web. Some of its members now actively take part in Cultural Policy Research Institute.\n\nThe organization has been famous for its views on heritage issues and advocating the lawful circulation of antiquities in a regulated trade that balances the interests of national heritage, archeological preservation and the international interest in cultural exchange by museum loans and the private market. ACCP's treasurer William Pearlstein has described Middle Eastern cultural heritage laws (especially those of Iraq) as \"retentionist\" and expressed a desire for the possibility of circulation of licensed exported antiquities. \n\nSome Archaeologists, academics, and cultural heritage lawyers have found these statements worrisome, as the members of ACCP are politically influential figures. Archaeological Institute of America's code of ethics maintain that its members \"refuse to participate in the trade in undocumented antiquities and refrain from activities that enhance the commercial value of such objects. Undocumented antiquities are those that are not documented as belonging to a public or private collection before December 30, 1970 when the AIA Council endorsed the UNESCO Convention on Cultural Property, or that have not been excavated and exported from the country of origin in accordance with the laws of that country.\" (Source: AIA official webpage) It is widely believed by many academics that the trade and collectorship of antiquities fuel the looting and destruction of archaeological sites around the world.\n\nAccording to published news reports and its own website, the ACCP was directed by Ashton Hawkins, former executive vice-president and Counsel to the Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The group had its inaugural meeting with a 45-people Board of Advisers on 9 October 2002. According to an Art Newspaper article (see below), among them were the antiquities collector Shelby White (see Leon Levy), the former Getty curator Arthur Houghton (a vice-president), the former Kimbell Art Museum director Edmund Pillsbury, and the legal scholar Prof John Merryman. Several lawyers from major museums were also there. William Pearlstein was the treasurer of the group and has also represented the National Association of Dealers in Ancient, Oriental and Primitive Art. \n\nAshton Hawkins, former lawyer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and current president of ACCP was reported in the Art Newspaper article as stating the following: \"We believe that legitimate dispersal of cultural material through the market is one of the best ways to protect it. We're interested in the protection of culture as much as the protection of legitimate collecting.\".\n\nThe ACCP's board of directors included President Ashton Hawkins, Vice President Arthur Houghton, Treasurer William Pearlstein, Educational coordinator Kate Fitz Gibbon and Secretary Arielle Kozloff.\n\nThe council appeared in the forefront of cultural heritage protection debates during the American 2003 invasion of Iraq. A 2003 article in Science discusses Ashton and Pearlstein's advocacy for \"liberalization\" in the issuance of foreign-dig permits in Iraq and reconsideration of Iraqi cultural heritage laws to allow “some objects [to be] certified for export.\" On ACCP's activities concerning Iraqi cultural heritage, Zainab Bahrani’s article \"Looting and Conquest\" takes a critical counter-position. Bahrani wrote that “William Pearlstein, of the American Council for Cultural Policy (ACCP), an organization that met with the White House and the Pentagon right before the [Iraq] war and right after the looting [of the National Museum of Iraq], is appealing for the cultural theft to continue by other means, calling Iraq's antiquities-preservation laws \"retentionist,\" and saying he \"hoped that Iraq would grant more excavation permits and consider export permits for redundant objects.\" She adds that such “opportunism opens the door to more cultural and historical plunder, a base scramble much like the parceling off of sites and antiquities that occurred in the nineteenth century.”\n\nACCP Advisory Board member Kate Fitz Gibbon, who served on the Cultural Property Advisory Committee to the US President from 2000—2003, has recently edited a book entitled \"Who owns the past: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law\" (Rutgers University Press 2005), which mostly features contributors affiliated with ACCP (e.g. William Pearlstein, Shelby White, Kate Fitz Gibbon etc.), and intends to propagate the legitimacy of \"the ability of museums and private collectors [in the US] to own art from other countries\" in the public opinion. Jean M. Borgatti (Clark University) published a favorable account of this book on H-Net reviews. According to Borgatti, the book in the overall sense critiques what they call \"retentive cultural nationalisms\" of \"source-nations\" who insist that archaeological artifacts should remain in the country of origin. The authors of the book present themselves as \"cultural internationalists\" who consider ancient artifacts as works of art that need to be circulated (in the antiquities market, Western museums, among Western collectors) to promote a \"cultural understanding\". \n\nCultural property is internationally protected by the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.\n\n"}
{"id": "16992056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16992056", "title": "Amice", "text": "Amice\n\nThe amice is a liturgical vestment used mainly in the Roman Catholic church, Lutheran church, some Anglican churches, and Armenian and Polish National Catholic churches.\n\nThe amice consists of a white cloth connected to two long ribbon-like attachments, by which it is fastened around the shoulders of the priest. Before the liturgical reforms of 1972, its use was mandatory for all Roman Catholic masses, but it is only required today if the alb does not cover the priest's ordinary clothing. Many priests choose to wear the amice for reasons of tradition or to prevent damage to their other vestments due to perspiration.\n\nCertain mendicant orders, such as the Dominicans and Franciscans, and some other orders with hooded habits, often donned the amice over the raised hood. The priest, or minister, then fastened the ribbons – crossed at the chest – behind his chest. The alb was donned over the hood and amice, and fastened. The hood/amice could then be retracted neatly around the collar.\n\nIn several Mediaeval uses, such as the Sarum Rite, the amice bore a broad stiff band of brocade or other decoration, giving the impression of a high collar. These were called \"apparelled amices\". This practice was abandoned at Rome at about the end of the 15th century, but continued in other parts of Europe until much later. By 1907, however, the practice was no longer tolerated in Roman Catholic liturgy, but still exists within many Anglican communities and in the Lutheran Church of Sweden.\n\nThis collar-like amice spread to the Armenian Church, where is retained as a normal part of the priestly vestments among the Armenian Orthodox.\n\nWhile donning the amice, the priest first drapes the amice over his head (as with a hood), then lowers it to his neck, tying it around his torso. During this action he prays a short prayer asking God to clothe him with the \"helmet of salvation\".\n"}

Born in Aberdeen, Scotland and raised on the Orkney Islands, he now resides in Edinburgh. He has written more than 60 books on maritime history, naval history, historical atlases, and other historical non-fiction.\n\nAlthough born in Aberdeen, Scotland, he was raised on the Orkney Islands. In 1978, at the age of 18 he left to join the Royal Navy. He received a scholarship to the Royal Navy College in Dartmouth, and went on to study history at Aberdeen University. After receiving a degree, he returned to the Royal Navy and spent a year at sea, during which, he visited many places that would later be written about in his naval books including the Caribbean. He also gained important knowledge of military service, customs, seamanship and navigation during this time. He then studied for a master's degree at the University of St. Andrews. During this time, he explored the new field of maritime archaeology and wrote his thesis on early naval artillery. Two decades later this formed the basis for \"Sovereigns of the Sea\", his history of Renaissance warships.\n\nHe left the navy in 1983, and the following year he began a Master of Letters in Maritime Studies at St. Andrews University, a course which combined history with maritime archaeology. After completing his Masters thesis on Renaissance Naval Artillery, he found a job in 1985 as a supervisor on an excavation in the River Thames near the Tower of London, paid for by the Royal Armouries. While he was working in the Royal Armouries, The Tower and the Kremlin decided to swap exhibits – a \"Treasures of the Tower\" being shown in Moscow while \"Treasures of the Kremlin\" came to London. At the same time the curators of both museums were encouraged to exchange information, and to examine each other's collections. This ended up with Konstam studying the 18th century Russian military. A mutual colleague introduced him to a historian working for Osprey Publishing, who turned out to want someone to write a book about Peter the Great's Army. The result was two small (15,000-word) books which first appeared in 1993 – the first easily accessible account of the foundation of the Russian army to appear in English.\n\nKonstam moved to Key West, Florida in 1995 and became the Chief Curator in the Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Museum. Mel Fisher was a treasure hunter who found the wreck of the Spanish treasure galleon Nuestra Señora de Atocha off the Florida Keys. One of his jobs during this time was to create traveling exhibits which toured the United States. During the research for a pirate exhibition, he gained an increasing interest in the subject of 18th century piracy. He spent six years in Key West and wrote several more books, including \"The History of Pirates (2002)\", which went on to sell over 70,000 copies. As he gained more information through his research, he produced \"Piracy: The Complete History (2008)\", and then, to reach a wider audience, \"The World Atlas of Pirates (2009)\".\n\nHe returned to Britain in early 2001, and now resides in Edinburgh, Scotland. He continues to write about naval and general history subjects. His favorite subject is the historical period of the 16th and 17th centuries. He currently has over 70 books in print and is on the board of The Society of Authors in Scotland and board of Publishing Scotland. Konstam has also been a \"talking head\" on many cable TV shows.\n\n\n\n"}

He helped his father in his business as a manufacturing chemist. At this time, he was deeply involved in cognate studies. His interest in cognate studies ended when his father suddenly died. After his father's death, Posnansky studied at the Imperial and Royal Academy of Pola (now Pula) for the position of Naval Military Engineer in the Austro-Hungarian Navy. During his time in the Imperial and Royal Academy of Pola, he made several extensive training voyages, which took him many places, including the Easter Islands in the South Pacific Ocean, as a part of his shipboard training. While on Easter Island, he made ethnological observations, which he later published as \"Die Osterinsel und ihre praehistorischen Monumente\". Posnansky graduated from the Imperial and Royal Academy of Pola at age 18.\n\nAt age 23 in 1896, Posnansky emigrated to South America. At first, he participated in various expeditions, which explored upper reaches of the Amazon River. During these expeditions, he became an experienced navigator of it and its tributaries. He used his expertise to become the director of a river navigation company, which was called \"La Empresa de Navegacao dos rios Purus e Acre\". As captain and owner of the shallow-draught steamer and blockade runner, \"Iris\", Posnansky rescued the survivors of the Acre garrison during the Acre Campaign in Brazil. This military campaign involved a dispute between Bolivia and Brazil over of territory on the Acre River. After being wounded and captured by Brazilian forces, he escaped and became a refugee in Europe. Because of his loyalty to and support of Bolivia in this conflict, he lost all of his properties in Brazil. His exploits during the Acre Campaign (1900-1901) are detailed in his book \"Campaña del Acre: la lancha \"Iris\"; aventuras y peregrinaciones\"\n\nAfter being a refugee in Europe, Posnansky moved to Bolivia to claim compensation for his services to this country. After finding that any substantial reward was unattainable because of the bankrupt state of the Bolivian treasury, he devoted his talents towards building private businesses involved in mining and international trade. In time, he became a prosperous entrepreneur. During this time, Posnansky introduced the first car to Bolivia. Posnansky died in La Paz, Bolivia in 1946.\n\nWhile his business ventures thrived, the Bolivian Government recognized Posnansky's service during the Acre Campaign. For his sacrifices in support of the Bolivian government, it first granted him the honorific title of \"Benemerito de la Patria\" (\"Worthy of the Nation\") and full Bolivian citizenship. Later, it awarded him two gold medals, one in 1901, the other in 1903. In 1905, his government service continued when he was elected to La Paz City Council.\n\nAfter settling in Bolivia, Posnansky repeatedly traveled the Bolivian and Peruvian highlands in efforts to locate, describe, and study Inca and pre-Inca archaeological sites. He was especially interested in those found along the shoreline and on the islands of Lake Titicaca. The results of these investigations were published in books such as \"The Islands of Titicaca and Koati\" and \"Rasas y monumentos prehistoricos del Altiplano Andino\". For such research, the Bolivian Senate awarded him a gold medal in 1905 and he later became Director of the National Museum. He also authored books, which included \"Os Indios Paumaris e Ipurinas no rio Purus\" (1898) and \"Mapa del rio Acre\" (7 volumes, 1897), about South American geography and ethnology. He also lectured about archaeological subjects in Berlin, Frankfort, Nuremberg, and Treptow, Germany. In recognition of his accomplishments, the German Government conferred on him an honorary title of Professor in 1914.\n\nPosnansky's final and most important book, \"Tihuanacu, the Cradle of American Man,\" was published in 1945 (volumes I and II) and 1957 (volumes III and IV). In it, Posnansky argued that Tiwanaku was constructed approximately 15,000 BC by American peoples, although not by the ancestors of those then living in the area, the Aymara. Posnansky also saw Tiwanaku as the origin point of civilization throughout the Americas, including the Inca, the Maya and others. Since the publication of the work, these ideas have since been discredited by later archaeological research. However, the photographs, detailed descriptions of structures and inscriptions, meticulously prepared maps, and numerous photographs found in this work constitute an extremely valuable historical record of the site. Posnansky's ideas about Tiwanaku having been a full-fledged city with a large permanent population, rather than only a seasonally occupied ceremonial center, and its abandonment having been the result of prehistoric climatic change are widely accepted in principle. This book and his personal efforts also contributed significantly to the eventual preservation of the site at a time when it was being very badly damaged by neglect, stone-quarrying, and looting.\n\nPonce Sangines, C.

Later rulers, especially the successful Ivan Asen II, styled themselves \"Tsars (Emperors) of Bulgarians and Greeks\".\n\nSome members of the Asen family entered Byzantine service in the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries. The name also occurs as a family name in modern Greek, and could go back to the same name.\n\nThe origins of the dynasty, especially the ethnic background of the three Asen brothers (Teodor I Peter IV, Ivan Asen I and Kaloyan) are still a source of much controversy, debated among historians. There are three main hypothesis regarding their origins:\nIn their own administrative documents and correspondence, the three rulers viewed themselves as descendants and successors of the Bulgarian Tsars Samuil, Peter I and Simeon I, and the state they founded as a continuation of the First Bulgarian Empire. However, this could be just a way to proclaim their legitimacy for the throne of the Empire.\n\nIn a correspondence, of 1199, the Pope talks about the \"Roman descent\" of Kaloyan. However, considering the actual text says \"Nos autem audito quod de nobili urbis Romae prosapia progenitores tui originem traxerint\" (\"We heard that your forefathers come from a noble family from the city of Rome\"), it is usually dismissed as simply a hidden compliment of the Pope to Kaloyan.\n\nPope Innocent III in his letter to the Bulgarian King Kaloyan (Calojoannes) in 1204 addressed him \"King of Bulgarians and Vlachs\" (\"rex Bulgarorum et Blachorum\"); in answering the Pope, John called himself \"imperator omnium Bulgarorum et Blachorum\" (\"Emperor of all Bulgarians and Vlachs'), but signed himself \"imperator Bulgariae Calojoannes\" (\"Emperor Kaloyan of Bulgaria\"); besides, the archbishop of Veliko Tarnovo called himself \"totius Bulgariae et Blaciae Primas\" (\"Primate of all Bulgaria and Vlachia\").\n\nThe Bulgarian historiography negate, while the Romanian highlight the role of the Vlachs in the uprising. However, the scientific debate reflects the nationalistic rivality from the 19-20th century, which did not exist in the 12-13th century. Vlachs and Bulgarian Slavs jointly inhabited Bulgaria, and both groups in sufferance were united against the common cause under a leader, regardless of the leader \"race\". The Asen brothers were associated with the Vlach population of the mountainous regions around Trnovo, Niketas Choniates recorded Vlach shamans during revolt exhibition, but nevertheless of their ethnicity, it was a joint venture of the Bulgarians, Vlachs and Cumans.\n\nThe name of the dynasty comes from one of the brothers, namely Asen I. The etymology is most likely of Cuman Turkic origin, derived from \"esen\" which meant \"safe, sound, healthy\" and the Belgun nickname seems to be derived from Turkic \"bilgün\", which meant \"wise\". Further support to this connection can be found in the charters of the Great Lavra of Mt. Athos from the end of the 12th century, which mention the monastery's problems with some of the Cuman stratiotes, where \"Asen\" is listed as the name of one of those Cumans.\n\nOther study shows that the only name that makes sense is \"änish\" (descent) and the word can be found almost exclusively in the languages of the Kıpçak Turks\n\nThe Asens in Byzantium largely descend from Ivan Asen III, who ruled briefly as Emperor of Bulgaria before fleeing to Constantinople as Ivaylo's uprising was gaining momentum in 1280. A \"despotes\" under Michael VIII Palaiologos, Ivan Asen III had already been married to the Byzantine Emperor's eldest daughter, Irene Palaiologina. The couple's five sons and two daughters were the progenitors of one of the highest-regarded Byzantine noble families of their time, along with the Palaiologoi. Among the Byzantine Asens, three bore the title of \"despotes\", three that of \"sebastokrator\", two \"panhypersebastos\", one was a \"megas doux\" and two were titled \"megas primikerios\".

He is the founder of the concept of historical continuity of Greece from antiquity to the present, establishing the tripartite division of Greek history in ancient, medieval and modern, and sought to set aside the prevailing views at the time that the Byzantine Empire was a period of decadence and degeneration, not recognized as part of Greek history.\n\nPaparrigopoulos introduced this division in his teaching at the University of Athens. His main work is the multi-volume \"History of the Greek Nation\" (\"Ιστορία του Ελληνικού Έθνους\"), covering the history of the Greeks from ancient to modern times, including the rediscovery of the Greek Middle Ages and their integration as part of the national history of Greece. He is also known for contradicting with robust arguments the controversial theories of Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer regarding the racial origins of the Greeks.\n\nPaparrigopoulos was born in Constantinople in 1815. His father, a native of Vytina, was killed by the rabble of Constantinople when the Greek War of Independence erupted in 1821. Paparrigopoulos not only saw this grisly spectacle, but he also attended the execution of his brother, Michael, and of his two uncles. His mother who survived the slaughters fled to Odessa, where Paparrigopoulos accomplished his studies as a bursar of the Tsar Alexander I.\n\nIn 1830 Paparrigopoulos travelled to Greece to study in the \"Central School\" (Κεντρικό Σχολείο) of Aegina, founded by the Greek leader Ioannis Kapodistrias. He continued his studies in the universities of France and Germany.\n\nReturning to Greece Paparrigopoulos was appointed in the ministry of Justice, but in 1845 he withdrew because he did not yet possess a Greek nationality. He was reappointed as a teacher when he obtained the Greek nationality (as a \"Gortynian\"). In 1851 he became a professor of history of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.\n\nIn 1873 Paparrigopoulos lost his beloved son and famous poet, Dimitrios Paparrigopoulos. In 1876 and 1884 the Greek state utilised him for national purposes, appointing him as president of the \"National Defence\" and as president of the \"Exhibition of the relics of the War of Independence\".\n\nIn 1843, while working in the Ministry of Justice, Paparrigopoulos published his first survey, \"About the emigration of Slav tribes in Peloponnese\", contradicting with robust arguments Fallmerayer's opinion that modern Greeks are of Slav descent, having no racial relation with the ancient Greeks. In 1844, he published his second survey, \"The last year of the Greek independence\", treating the fall of Corinth. In 1855 he gave his inaugural lecture as professor of the university, contradicting a theory that did not recognise the importance of the Dorian influence on the civilization of ancient Greece.\n\nNonetheless, his monumental writing is the \"History of the Greek nation\", comprising 6 volumes, which were later complemented by Pavlos Karolidis. Paparrigopoulos published the first volume in 1860 and completed his work in 1877 with the last volume, which constituted a synopsis of the Greek War of Independence. The best edition of the \"History of the Greek nation\" is the edition of Eleftheroudakis in 1925 with the application of Karolidis. In this work he adopted the tripartite examination of periods already introduced by Spyros Zampelios (ancient Hellenism, medieval Hellenism, modern Hellenism) and used it as a tool for the narration of the course of the Greek nation throughout the centuries.\n\nPaparrigopoulos is considered the \"national\" historian of modern Greece. In his \"History of the Greek Nation\", he regarded the history of Greece from the ancient years till nowadays as a unity, insisting on the continuity of the Greek nation. At the same time he promoted the importance of the Byzantine Empire and of the Byzantine history in general. Because of his profound surveys, the disdain towards the Byzantine history was limited.\n\nThe interpretation of Byzantium's Greek character in the work of Sp. Zampelios was the first step in the effort to refute Fallmerayer's theory. It was supported that the ancient Greek civilization had not faded away, but had been creatively reshaped as it met Christianity, which took place during the Byzantine Empire. With Zampelios then, the foundations were prepared in order for a total national history to be written, in order for the past, the continuous course of the Greek nation from antiquity till the 19th century, to be narrated. This ambitious project was undertaken and completed by Constantine Paparrigopoulos, who is considered for this reason the founder of Greek national historiography, also known as Greek historism.\n\nPaparrigopoulos, as well as Sp. Zampelios set the basis for the formation of national identity in modern Greek society. Besides, their work did not concern only a closed and restricted circle of specialists and academics. It was addressed to the society of their times, in order to strengthen their national self-knowledge. Besides, Paparrigopoulos' classes at the University, which constituted the raw material for the writing of his memorable History, were frequently published in Pandora magazine, of which he was the co-publisher, as well as in the Athenian Press. The term Greek-Christian which was devised for scientific purposes, functioned towards the same direction but did not remain a simple instrument of analysis in the hands of specialists. As this term appeared in mid-ninth century exactly, it became a canvass on which the ideology of the Greek state was developed and shaped. The content of education, the orientation of historical studies and the study of tradition (folklore) were organized on this basis. In addition, the Megali Idea (Greek Great Idea) which was nebulous until that time, acquired flesh and bones. The Byzantine Empire, which had now been acclaimed a cultural mold of the Greek state which was still small, became the model for its territorial expansion.\n\nAnother great virtue of Paparrigopoulos is the elegance of his style and his literary charisma, which makes his texts readable and his narrations particularly vivid. His elegance is the main merit that places him higher than the other great modern Greek historian, Pavlos Karolidis.\n\nPaparrigopoulos not only offered a united image of the history (ancient-medieval-modern) of the Greek nation, but, at the same time, he articulated in the most stirring way the pains and the dramas of the modern Hellenism.\n\nAll his main writings are in Greek.\n\n"}

He substantially extended and revised the work of Carl Meinhof, his teacher, although he rejected some of Meinhof's theories only implicitly. Westermann is seen as one of the founders of modern African linguistics. \n\nHe carried out extensive linguistic and anthropological research in the area ranging from Senegal eastwards to the Upper Nile. His linguistic publications cover a wide range of African languages, including the Gbe languages, Nuer, Kpelle, Shilluk, Hausa, and Guang. \n\nWestermann's comparative work, begun in 1911, initially brought together much of today's Niger–Congo and Nilo-Saharan language phyla under the name Sudanic languages. His most important later publication \"Die westlichen Sudansprachen\" 1927a divided these into East and West Sudanic languages and laid the basis for what would become Niger–Congo. In this book and a series of associated articles between 1925 and 1928, Westermann both identified a large number of roots that form the basis of our understanding of Niger–Congo and set out the evidence for the coherence of many of the families that constitute it. Much of the classification of African languages associated with Joseph Greenberg actually derives from the work of Westermann.\nIn 1927 Westermann published a \"Practical Orthography of African Languages\" which became later known as the \"Westermann script\". Subsequently he published the influential and oft-reprinted \"Practical Phonetics for Students of African Languages\" in collaboration with Ida C.

The city is located along 7 km (5 mi) of the Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain. The city's population includes a high proportion of immigrants arriving since 1990, notably from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union. In it had a population of .\n\nHadera was established in 1891 as a farming colony by members of the Zionist group, Hovevei Zion, from Lithuania and Latvia. By 1948, it was a regional center with a population of 11,800. In 1952, Hadera was declared a city, with jurisdiction over an area of 53,000 dunams.\n\nHadera was founded in 1891, in the early days of modern Zionism by Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Latvia on land purchased by Yehoshua Hankin, known as the Redeemer of the Valley. The land was purchased from a Christian effendi, Selim Khuri. This was the largest purchase of land in Eretz Israel by a Zionist group, although the land was of low quality and mostly swampland. The only inhabitants prior to the purchase were a few families raising water buffaloes and selling reeds. The town may derive its name from the Arabic word \"khadra\", meaning \"green\" in reference to the wild weeds which covered the marshes on which the town is built. Historical geographer, Mordechai Eshel, citing a geographical work written in 1913, claims that the existing site whereon is now built Hadera was formerly called in Arabic \"Ǧadera\", being the site of the town, \"Gadera of Caesarea\" (Hebrew: גדרה של קיסרין), mentioned in Tosefta \"Shevi'it\", ch. 7. Others say that the ancient Gadera should be identified with \"Tel Um Qeis\".\n\nThe first modern settlers lived in a house known as the Khan near Hadera's main synagogue. Initially, Hadera was a lonely outpost of 10 families and 4 guards. In its early years, however, the town had issues with land ownership having drained the swamps with the aid of Egyptian workers sent to them by Baron Edmond de Rothschild.\n\nOld tombstones in the local cemetery reveal that out of a population of 540, 210 died of malaria. Therefore a Bible verse from the Psalms (Tehillim) was inscribed in the city's logo: \"Those who sow in tears, will reap with songs of joy.\" (Ps 126:5)\n\nRelations between the residents of Hadera and neighboring Bedouins were poor and HaShomer organization was assigned to guarding the fields. By the early twentieth century, the town had become a regional economic center. Land disputes in the area were resolved by the 1930s, by which time, the population had grown to 2,002 in 1931. Free schooling was introduced in the city in 1937 in all schools apart from the Histadrut school.\nHadera's population began to grow dramatically after Israeli independence in 1948 as immigrants flocked to the country. Among the immigrants to the city were Russian and other European immigrants and also 40 Yemenite families. In 1953, Israel's first paper mill opened in the town. Sponsored by investors from within Israel as well as from the United States, Brazil, and Australia, the mill was designed to meet all of Israel's paper needs. It was also at this time that the Givat Olga neighborhood was constructed on the coast, and Beit Eliezer in the east of the city. In 1964, Hadera was declared a city.\n\nThe city grew dramatically during the 1990s as it absorbed large numbers of Russian and Ethiopian immigrants. Hadera, considered a safe place by its inhabitants, was jolted by several acts of terrorism, including a massacre of six civilians at a Bat Mitzvah and a suicide bomber who blew himself up at a falafel stand on October 26, 2005, killing seven civilians, and 55 were injured, of them five in severe condition. In addition, four civilians were killed when a terrorist opened fire on pedestrians at a bus stop on October 28, 2001. However, since the construction of the nearby West Bank barrier, the frequency of such incidents has dropped drastically. On August 4, 2006, three rockets fired by Hezbollah hit Hadera. Hadera is south of the Lebanese border and marked the farthest point inside Israel hit by Hezbollah.\n\nHadera has traditionally been known as a backwater. However, in the 2000s, several projects were launched to improve the quality of life in Hadera. The city center was regenerated, a high-tech business park was constructed, and the world's largest desalination plant was built. In addition, the city has slowly but steadily attracted new home-buyers. Currently, a development plan is underway to turn Hadera into a major center of home ownership, business, and vacation. Some 18,000 new homes will be built, including 2,500 villas and cottages and 1,300 luxury apartments on the coast. These housing units will be built in new neighborhoods that will be built in the underdeveloped northeastern part of the city, and of the coastline will be developed. A large park and several major shopping malls will be built. Ten new hotels with a total of 1,800 rooms will also be built; the city is planned to become a future vacation destination due to its closeness to the Galilee, beaches, and access to major highways.\n\nHadera is located on the Israeli Mediterranean coastal plain, north of Tel Aviv. The city's jurisdiction covers , making it the fourth largest city in the country. Nahal Hadera Park, a eucalyptus forest covering and Hasharon Park are located on the outskirts of Hadera.\n\nHadera lies along two main Israel Railways lines: the Coastal Line and the nowadays freight-only Eastern Line. The city's railway station is located in the west of the city and is on the Tel Aviv suburban line which runs between Binyamina and Ashkelon. The city center of Hadera is located near Israel's two main north-south highways; Highway 2, linking Tel Aviv to Haifa, and Highway 4. This made Hadera an important junction for all coastal bus transportation after 1948 and into the 1950s.\n\nHadera's importance as an economic center was first recognised when Israel's first paper mill was opened here in 1953. Hadera Paper continues to be a large employer in the city. In December 2009 the world's largest desalination plant of its type, located within the municipal borders, was inaugurated. Hadera is the location of the Orot Rabin Power Plant, Israel's largest power station.\n\nAccording to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, as of October 2013, Hadera had a population of 91,634 which is growing at an annual rate of 1.2%. As of 2003, the city had a population density of 1,516.6 per km. Of the city's population of 2013 of 91,634, approximately 23,407 were immigrants, many from Ethiopia.\n\nAccording to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Hadera had a population of 540 inhabitants, consisting of 450 Jews, 89 Muslims and 1 Christian. \nHadera has grown steadily since 1948, when the city had a population of 11,800. In 1955, the population almost doubled to 22,500. In 1961 it rose to 25,600, 1972 to 32,200, and 1983, to 38,700.\n\nThe median age in Hadera is 32.8, with 23,200 people 19 years of age or younger, 12.1% between 20 and 29, 14,100 between 30 and 44, 17,600 from 45 to 64, and 9,700, 65 or older. , there were 37,500 males and 39,200 females.\n\nIn 2001, the ethnic makeup was 99.2% Jewish and other non-Arab, with no significant Arab population. In 2000, there were 27,920 salaried workers and 1,819 self-employed. The mean monthly wage in 2000 for a salaried worker was ILS 5,135, a real change of 8.0% over the course of 2000. Salaried males had a mean monthly wage of ILS 6,607 (a real change of 9.0%) compared with ILS 3,598 for females (a real change of 3.1%). The mean income for the self-employed was 6,584. A total of 1,752 people received unemployment benefits and 6,753 received income supplements.\n\nIn 2001, there were 15,622 students studying at 42 schools (24 elementary schools with 7,933 students, and 21 high schools with 7,689 students). A total of 57.5% of 12th graders were entitled to a matriculation certificate.\n\nThe Democratic School of Hadera, which opened in 1987, was the first of its kind in Israel. The Technoda, an educational center for science and technology equipped with a state-of-the-art telescope and planetarium, is located in Hadera's Givat Olga neighborhood.\n\nHadera is served by the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center.\n\nNeighborhoods of Hadera include Givat Olga, Beit Eliezer, Kfar Brandeis, Haotzar, Hephzibah, Neve Haim, Nissan, Ephraim, Bilu, Klarin, Nahaliel, Shimshon, Shlomo, Pe'er, Bialik, Beitar and The Park.\n\nHadera is home to four current football clubs: Hapoel Hadera, which currently plays in Israeli Premier League after being promoted at the end of the last season.

Late in life, when Díaz del Castillo was 84 years old and living in his encomienda estates in Guatemala, he wrote \"The True History of the Conquest of New Spain\" to defend the story of the common-soldier \"conquistador\" within the histories about the Spanish conquest of Mexico. He presents his narrative as an alternative to the critical writings of Bartolomé de Las Casas, whose Indian-native histories emphasized the cruelty of the conquest as well as the histories of the hagiographic biographers of Hernán Cortés (specifically that of Francisco López de Gómara, who Díaz del Castillo believed minimized the role of the 700 enlisted soldiers instrumental to conquering the Aztec Empire). That said, Díaz del Castillo strongly defended the actions of the conquistadors, whilst emphasising their humanity and honesty in his eyewitness narrative, which he summarised as this: \"We went there to serve God, and also to get rich.\"\n\nThe history is occasionally uncharitable about Cortés; like other professional soldiers who participated in the Conquest of New Spain, Díaz del Castillo found himself among the ruins of Tenochtitlán only slightly wealthier than when he arrived to Mexico. That was common to many soldiers, who accused Cortés of taking more loot than his agreed fifth of the Aztec treasury. Certainly, the land and gold compensation paid to many of the \"conquistadores\" proved a poor return for their investment of months of soldiering and fighting across Mexico and the Anahuac Valley. Another interpretation of the book is that the author was one of several family relatives of Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, the governor of Cuba and a mortal enemy of Cortés; many of whom later plotted against the conquistador Captain. Although the narrative minimizes the Cortés–Díaz del Castillo relationship, the author's complex relationship with Cortés and the lower captains suggests that although he represented the faction of Governor Velázquez de Cuéllar in the expedition, Díaz del Castillo fully honoured Cortés's personal and military loyalty.\n\n\n"}

It is thought to be the outline of a person who was sitting at the entrance of Hiroshima Branch of Sumitomo Bank when the atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima. It is also known as Human Shadow of Death.\n\nAccording to the museum, it is thought that the person had been sitting on the stone step waiting for the bank to open when the heat from the bomb burned the surrounding stone white and left their shadow. A black deposit was also found on the shadow. A piece of stone containing the artifact (3.3 meters wide by 2 meters high) was cut from the original location and moved to the museum.\n\nIn January 1971, the museum acquired the stone, whose human shadow had become indistinct due to weathering. In April 1975, the museum began research into preserving the shadow. In 1991, the museum reported that earnest investigation of preservation methods had commenced. At present, the stone is surrounded by glass.\n\nIt is thought that the person depicted in the stone died immediately with the flash of the atomic bomb, or after falling down after the explosion. Some people stated that they saw the person sitting at the entrance just before the bombing. A former soldier testified that he had recovered the person's body. However, the person's identity is still unknown. As of 2016, the museum exhibit states that \"Several people have suggested that the person could be a member of their family\". In the past, the museum exhibit contained a statement that the person was a 42-year-old woman named Mitsuno Koshitomo (越智ミツノ). As a result of these previous statements, some conclusions in the literature state that she was the person depicted in the stone.\n\nAccording to museum staff, many visitors to the museum believe that the shadow is the outline of a human vaporized immediately after the bombing. However, the possibility of human vaporization is not supported from a medical perspective. The ground surface temperature is thought to have ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 degrees Celsius just after the bombing. Exposing a body to this level of radiant heat would leave bones and carbonized organs behind. While radiation could severely inflame and ulcerate the skin, complete vaporization of the body is impossible.\n\nHuman Shadow Etched in Stone was originally part of the stone steps at the entrance of the Hiroshima Branch of Sumitomo Bank, located 260 meters from ground zero. The current location of the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Hiroshima Branch is Kamiya-cho 1 Chome.\n\nThe bank was built in 1928. It was designed by at the department of engineering of Sumitomo Group (now Nikken Sekkei), and was constructed by the Obayashi Corporation. The building was constructed out of reinforced concrete, with four floors above ground and one below with an open ceiling up to the third floor. The rooms for business, reception and specie were on the first floor, the meeting rooms and cafeteria on the fourth floor, and the boiler room in the basement. It was built south of the head office of Geibi Bank (Now head office of ,) which had been built the year before and was almost the same size. It had Romanesque architecture style in general, and was characterized by a large arch with molding on its front.\n\nIt was not totally destroyed in the bombing of August 6, 1945. While the interior was destroyed, the exterior remained. Fortunately, the specie room was not damaged, and the cash and passbooks remained. Papers inside the building were blown as far away as by the blast.\n\nOn the morning of the bombing, the bank was to be open as usual. Most of the employees were on their way to the office when the bomb was dropped. There were 29 employees killed immediately (including those in the branch and those on their way to work), 40 injured and none missing. Some of the survivors died within a few days from radiation sickness, while others worked until retirement. Passersby took refuge in the building as it was close to ground zero, and a large number of bodies were recovered.\n\nThe branch reopened after the war, and the entrance soon became a famous landmark of the damage caused by the atomic bombing. It was officially recognized by Hiroshima City as an A-bomb site. In those days, the shadow was called \"Human Shadow of Death\". According to a testimony, it was the second most famous sight next to the Atomic Bomb Dome. Sumitomo Bank went to great lengths to preserve the shadow. In 1959 they built a fence surrounding the stone, and in 1967 they covered the stone with tempered glass to prevent deterioration.\n\nIn 1971, the Hiroshima Branch was planned to be rebuilt. The stone around the shadow was cut out and donated to the museum.\n\nAccording to (1947–), a radiology scientist, in his childhood he heard of the saying that the shadow had been generated after human vaporization. \"Journal on the damage of atomic bombing in Hiroshima\" (広島原爆戦災誌), published by Hiroshima City in 1971, also contains a description implying human vaporization, which is now proved to be impossible.\nIn the 1994 Committee on Health and Welfare of the House of Councillors, mentioned the stone, saying \"One was vaporized and vanished immediately. Only the shadow remained.\"\n\n\n"}

His \"Nouveaux principes d'économie politique, ou de la richesse dans ses rapports avec la population\" (1819) represents the first liberal critique of early capitalism and laissez-faire economics. He was one of the pioneering advocates of unemployment insurance, sickness benefits, a progressive tax, regulation of working hours, and a pension scheme. He was also the first to coin the term \"proletariat\" to refer to the working class created under capitalism, and his discussion of \"mieux value\" anticipates the Marxist concept of surplus value. According to Gareth Stedman Jones, \"much of what Sismondi wrote became part of the standard repertoire of socialist criticism of modern industry.\"\n\nHis paternal family seem to have borne the name Simonde, at least from the time when they migrated from Dauphiné to Switzerland at the revocation of the edict of Nantes. It was not till after Sismondi had become an author that, observing the identity of his family arms with those of the once flourishing Pisan house of the Sismondi and finding that some members of that house had migrated to France, he assumed the connection without further proof and called himself Sismondi.\n\nThe Simondes, however, were themselves citizens of Geneva of the upper class, and possessed both rank and property, though the father was also a village pastor. His uncle by marriage was the prominent pastor Jacob Vernes, a friend of Voltaire and Rousseau.\n\nThe future historian was well educated, but his family wished him to devote himself to commerce rather than literature, and he became a banker's clerk in Lyon. Then the Revolution broke out, and as it affected Geneva, the Simonde family took refuge in England where they stayed for eighteen months (1793–1794). Disliking—it is said—the climate, they returned to Geneva, but found the state of affairs still unfavourable; there is even a legend that the head of the family was reduced to sell milk himself in the town. The greater part of the family property was sold, and with the proceeds they emigrated to Italy, bought a small farm in Pescia near Lucca and Pistoia, and set to work to cultivate it themselves.\n\nSismondi worked hard there, with both his hands and mind, and his experiences gave him the material of his first book, \"Tableau de l'agriculture toscane\", which, after returning to Geneva, he published there in 1801. At a young age, Sismondi had read \"The Wealth of Nations\" and became strongly attached to Smith's theories. He apparently published his first work on the subject of political economy, \"De la richesse commerciale ou principes de l'economie politique appliqué à la legislation du commerce\" (1803) to explain and popularize Smith's doctrine, but following this Sismondi spent a considerable amount of time dedicated to historical research. He again turned his attention to political economy around 1818 when he was commissioned to write an entry on \"Political Economy\" for the \"Edinburgh Encyclopædia\". This was just following a serious economic downturn after the outbreak of the first major crisis in 1815.\n\nAs an economist, Sismondi represented a humanitarian protest against the dominant orthodoxy of his time. In his 1803 book, he followed Adam Smith; but in his principal subsequent economic work, \"Nouveaux principes d'économie politique\" (1819), he insisted on the fact that economic science studied the means of increasing wealth too much, and the use of wealth for producing happiness, too little. For the science of economics, his most important contribution was probably his discovery of economic cycles. In refutation of other thinkers at the time (notably J. B. Say and David Ricardo), Sismondi challenged the idea that economic equilibrium leading to full employment would be immediately and spontaneously achieved. He wrote, \"Let us beware of this dangerous theory of equilibrium which is supposed to be automatically established. A certain kind of equilibrium, it is true, is reestablished in the long run, but it is after a frightful amount of suffering.\" He was not a socialist; but, in protesting against laissez faire and invoking the state \"to regulate the progress of wealth\", he was an interesting precursor of the German Historical school of economics.\n\nHis theory may more precisely be classed as one of periodic \"crises,\" rather than \"cycles\" per se. and as such is the earliest theorist of systemic Crisis theory. His theory was adapted by Charles Dunoyer, who introduces the notion of cycling between two phases, thus giving a modern form of economic cycle.\n\nSismondi also contributed a great deal to economics with his thoughts on aggregate demand. Observing the capitalist industrial system in England, Sismondi saw that unchecked competition both resulted in producers all increasing individual production (because of lack of knowledge of other producers' production) this was then seen as forcing employers to cut prices, which they did by sacrificing workers' wages. This yielded overproduction \"and\" underconsumption; with most of England's workforce suffering from depressed wages, workers were then unable to afford the goods they had produced, and underconsumption of goods then followed. Sismondi believed that by increasing the wages of laborers they would have more buying power, be able to buy the national output and thus increase demand.\n\nIn his book \"On Classical Economics\", Thomas Sowell devotes a chapter to Sismondi, arguing that he was a neglected pioneer.\n\nMeanwhile, he began to compile his great \"Histoire des républiques italiennes du Moyen Âge\", and was introduced to Madame de Staël. He became part of her Coppet group, he was invited or commanded—for Madame de Stael was of chief political importance—to form one of the suite with which the future Corinne made the journey to Italy, which contributed to Corinne itself during the years 1804–1805. Sismondi was not altogether at ease here, and he particularly disliked Schlegel who was also a participant. But during this journey he met the Countess of Albany, widow of Charles Edward, who all her life was gifted with a singular ability to attract the affection of men of letters. Sismondi's platonic relationship with her was close and lasted long, and they produced much valuable and interesting correspondence.\n\nIn 1807 appeared the first volumes of the above-mentioned book about the Italian republics, which, though his essay in political economy had brought him some reputation and the offer of a Russian professorship, first made Sismondi a prominent man among European men of letters. The completion of this book, which extended to sixteen volumes, occupied him, though by no means entirely, for the next eleven years. He lived at first in Geneva where he delivered some interesting lectures about the literature of southern Europe, which were continued from time to time and finally published. He held an official position: secretary of the chamber of commerce for the then department of Leman. \n\nSismondi lived in Paris from 1813 until the Restoration, supporting Napoleon Bonaparte and meeting him once. Upon completing his book on Italian history, in 1818 he began his \"Histoire des Français\", published in 29 volumes over 23 years. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, \"His untiring industry enabled him to compile many other books, but it is on these two that his fame mainly rests. The former displays his qualities in the most favourable light, and has been least injuriously affected by subsequent writings and investigations. But the latter, as a careful and accurate sketch on a grand scale, has now been superseded. Sainte-Beuve has, with benevolent sarcasm, surnamed the author \"the Rollin of French History,\" and the praise and the blame implied in the comparison are both perfectly well deserved\".\n\nIn April 1819 Sismondi married a Welshwoman, Jessie Allen (1777–1853), whose sister, Catherine Allen, was the wife of Sir James Mackintosh and another sister, Elizabeth Allen, was the wife of Josiah Wedgwood II and mother of Emma Wedgwood. This marriage appears to have been a very happy one. In 1826 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nAfter spending the last years of his life in Geneva preparing new editions of his writings, finishing his study of the French, and serving as a member of the Geneva Assembly, speaking for freedom with order, he died in 1842 of stomach cancer.\n\nBesides the works mentioned above Sismondi produced many others, never working less than eight hours a day for many years. The most important ones are: \"Littérature du midi de l'Europe\" [Literature of Southern Europe] (1813), a historical novel entitled \"Julia Severa ou l'an 492\" (1822), \"Histoire de la renaissance de la liberté en Italie\" (1832), \"Histoire de la chute de l'Empire romain\" (1835), \"Précis de l'histoire des Français\", an abridgment of his own book (1839), and several others, mainly political pamphlets.\n\nSismondi's journals and his correspondence with Channing, with the countess of Albany and with others have been published mainly by M Mongolfier (Paris, 1843) and M. de Saint-René Taillandier (Paris, 1863). The latter work serves as the main text of two admirable \"Lundis\" of Sainte-Beuve (September 1863), republished in the \"Nouveaux Lundis\", vol. VI.\n\nHe was a historian whose economic ideas passed through different phases. The acceptance of free trade principles in \"De la richesse commerciale\" was abandoned in favour of a critical posture towards free trade and industrialisation. \"Nouveaux principes d'économie politique\" attacked wealth accumulation both as an end in itself, and for its detrimental effect on the poor. He indicated contradictions of capitalism. He criticized the harsh conditions endured by the workers from the standpoint of a liberal republican. He was also a passionate opponent of slavery. Adolphe Blanqui said of him: \"No writer has shown a sympathy more notable and more touching for the working classes.\" Jean-Baptiste Say referred to Sismondi as \"that enlightened author, ingenious, eloquent and selfless.\" \n\nHis critique was noticed by Malthus, David Ricardo and J. S. Mill, who called his writing \"sprightly, and frequently eloquent.\" While a young man at Edinburgh, Thomas Carlyle translated Sismondi's article on \"Political Economy\" for David Brewster's \"Edinburgh Encyclopædia\". Sismondi subsequently influenced Carlyle's views on \"the dismal science.\" Sismondi's Italian histories were read and esteemed by Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Stendhal.\n\nSismondi influenced many major socialist thinkers including Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, and Robert Owen. Marx thought Sismondi embodied the critique of the \"bourgeois science of economics.\" In his notes, Marx excerpted various aspects of his analysis. Marx was particularly fond of Sismondi's statement that \"The Roman proletariat lived almost exclusively at the expense of society. One could almost say that modern society lives at the expense of the proletariat, from the share which it deducts from the reward of his labor.\" Henryk Grossman argued that Sismondi was a \nsignificant methodological and theoretical predecessor of Marx, particularly by identifying the contradiction between use-value and exchange-value as fundamental to capitalism. Vladimir Lenin attempted to discredit Sismondi's work because of the latter's influence on the Narodnik movement. Sismondi's writings were widely disseminated throughout Russia during the nineteenth century. Rosa Luxemburg defended Sismondi against Lenin's criticisms, as Sismondi's argument that consumption could not keep up with production under capitalism influenced Luxemburg's belief in the inherently imperialist nature of capitalism.\n\n\n\n"}

He first achieved prominence in 1990 when the contents of his on-the-record interview with then Tánaiste Brian Lenihan, in which Lenihan admitted making calls to the residence of the Irish president seeking to speak to President Hillery to urge him to refuse a Dáil dissolution in controversial circumstances (something he had previously denied), led to Lenihan's dismissal from government, his defeat in that year's Irish presidential election and the unexpected election of the left wing liberal Mary Robinson as President of Ireland.\n\nDuffy was one of six people chosen to submit international reports on heads of state to Australia's Republic Advisory Committee in 1993. He was an occasional contributor to \"The Irish Times\" and the \"Sunday Independent\", and a columnist in \"Magill\" magazine, as well as appearing on radio and television prior to his appointment to Kenny's office, but has ceased all media work since that date. \n\nDuffy was born in Drogheda in Meath in 1966. His family are long-term residents of the townland of Durhamstown in the civil parish of Ardbraccan and the barony of Lower Navan, outside Navan in County Meath. On his maternal side, through his mother Bernadette Duffy (née Cadden) he is descended from Ballydurrow, in Munterconnaught, Cavan.\n\nJim Duffy was educated in Bohermeen National School and St. Patrick's Classical School in Navan, where his classmates included the journalist Simon Cumbers (who was killed by Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia in 2004). In 1984 Duffy began to study History and Politics in University College Dublin, achieving a 2:1 degree in 1987. He received a first class honours degree for his post-graduate thesis on the presidency of Ireland in 1991.\n\nIn 1990 as part of his postgraduate thesis for his Master of Arts in Political Science Duffy interviewed senior politicians, one of whom was the then Tánaiste, Brian Lenihan. The on-the-record interview, in May 1990, formed one source for a major series of articles on the presidency of Ireland, published in \"The Irish Times\" in September 1990. In the interview Lenihan confirmed what he had previously confirmed to other writers over eight years, that on 27 January 1982 he, along with party leader Charles Haughey and a colleague, Sylvester Barrett, had repeatedly phoned Áras an Uachtaráin, the residence of the President of Ireland, to try to put pressure on the President, Patrick Hillery, to refuse a dissolution of parliament to the Taoiseach (prime minister), Dr Garret FitzGerald. (FitzGerald's government had just been defeated in Dáil Éireann in a vote on the budget.)\n\nIn October 1990, in the midst of the presidential election, FitzGerald was to be a guest, alongside Lenihan, on RTÉ One's \"Questions and Answers\" political debate programme. He has previously issued a press release about the phone calls issue, but it had received no publicity. He decided to raise the issue of the calls again on the programme, given that in the preceding week Lenihan changed his story of eight years and had now denied twice, first in a student debate, then in an Irish Press interview with Emily O'Reilly, making any calls. When challenged on the programme Lenihan maintained that his October 1990 version was correct, denying that he had played \"any hand, act of part\" in attempts to pressurise President Hillery. FitzGerald had been in Áras an Uachtaráin on the night of the calls and had been told by the President's staff that Lenihan had persistently been making calls. FitzGerald aggressively challenged Lenihan, saying \"I was in the Áras, Brian, and I know how many calls there were.\"\n\nAware that Lenihan had been one of Duffy's sources for the original article in September, with Duffy's permission the Irish Times ran a front-page story stating that Lenihan had made the calls he was now denying. In the resulting furore Lenihan's campaign manager Bertie Ahern either deliberately or accidentally revealed on a radio programme that Duffy had interviewed Lenihan. Duffy became the subject of mounting political and media pressure, with his silence being spun by Fianna Fáil press staff as evidence that the rumours that Lenihan had confirmed to him that he had made calls were false. (Lenihan had assured his campaign team that he had said nothing in the interview that could cause problems.) After three days of intense political and media pressure, Duffy released the relevant proportion of the on-the-record tape interview he had done with Lenihan. The release took place in a press conference in a Dublin hotel.\n\nThe release of the tape threw Lenihan's campaign into meltdown. Lenihan tried in a subsequent live television interview on the \"Six-One News\" to insist that what he had said to Duffy was wrong, insisting that \"on mature recollection\" his October 1990 version was the correct one, and all that he had said previously over eight years was incorrect. However his popularity plummeted by 18% overnight. The opposition Fine Gael party put down a Motion of No Confidence in the government. The Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, denied that Lenihan was under any pressure to resign. However, when the minority party in government, the Progressive Democrats, threatened to quit government unless Lenihan resigned or was sacked, and Lenihan refused to resign, the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, instructed President Hillery to sack him. Lenihan went on to become the first candidate from his party ever to lose an Irish presidential election, with the Labour Party candidate, Mary Robinson, eventually winning the office.\n\nDuffy was strongly attacked by the Taoiseach and members of the government under parliamentary privilege, with claims that his research was bogus and that he had been part of a secret plot to destroy Lenihan. However, his thesis on the presidency of Ireland was awarded a First Class honour by the National University of Ireland. He has written an account of the events of this period in the March 2006 edition of Magill magazine.\n\nOn the basis of his studies of international heads of state, Duffy was one of six people (including Sir Ellis Clarke, the former Governor-General and President of Trinidad and Tobago) commissioned in 1993 by Australia's Republic Advisory Committee to prepare reports on international republican experiences —to appear as an appendix to the committee's main report. His report, along with those of five others, was submitted as part of that larger report to the then Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating.\n\nDuffy's recommendations formed a part of the debate in Australia on the possible move from being a monarchy to become a republic. His description of heads of state as fitting three distinct categories (chief executive, Nominal chief executive and Non-Executive) was widely used in the subsequent debate, and were referred to in major speeches by all sides in the debate.\n\nDuring the constitutional referendum on creating a republic in 1999 Duffy in Australian media interviews was critical of the form of presidency being proposed, arguing in particular that the lack of security of tenure offered to the proposed office holder would seriously compromise the office holder's independence and ability to exercise their powers.\n\nThe 1999 referendum on declaring an Australian republic was ultimately defeated.\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, Duffy worked as a researcher and as a political commentator for most major Irish publications, including \"The Irish Times\", the \"Irish Independent\", the \"Sunday Independent\", the \"Sunday Times\", the \"Sunday Tribune\", \"The Sunday Business Post\" and the \"Irish Examiner\". He also was a contributor to RTÉ radio and television, the BBC, UTV and Sky News. His contributions largely focused on politics, history, religion and current affairs.\n\nHe was a columnist with \"Magill\" magazine, Ireland'a major political and current affairs magazine, until October 2007 when he resigned to take up a research post in politics.\n\nIn April and May 2007 he was one of the main contributors to \"Uachtarán\", an eight-part TG4 documentary on the office of President of Ireland.\n\nIn May 2007, the \"Sunday Independent\" reported that Duffy had been appointed a Deputy Press Officer for Fine Gael for the duration of 2007 general election.\n\nIn October 2007 Duffy was appointed a policy officer in his office by the leader of Fine Gael, Enda Kenny. Duffy resigned his post as columnist with Magill magazine and since that date has ceased to do media work. His new role also involves participating in the National Forum on Europe, a government-created think-tank on the relationship between the European Union and Ireland.\n\nHe was a contributor to the Irish Times's \"Rite and Reason\" religious column on more than one occasion. One article in 1998, proposing the existence of \"Rites of Same Sex Union\" (in effect gay marriages) in early Christian prayerbooks up to mediaeval times, caused a controversy. The article has been republished on gay websites and some religious websites worldwide and has been quoted in debates on gay marriage in the United States, France, the Netherlands and has also featured in parliamentary debates in Ireland, including a submission in 2005 from a gay advocacy group to the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which was exploring whether to amend the Constitution of Ireland to allow gay marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was also an official of the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party (\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\" / SED). During the 1960s he was a member of the politburo's \"Ideology Commission\", widely regarded as one of the most committed and effective propagandists among East Germany's mainstream academic historians. His publications and political engagement after reunificaion reflected a continuing commitment to East German-style communism.\n\nBerthold was born in Hindenburg (as Zabrze had been renamed after 1914). Hindenburg was a substantial manufacturing city in Upper Silesia: the 1921 plebiscite had identified it as a predominantly German-speaking city, albeit by a narrow margin. Lothar Berthold's father worked as a customs official. After completing his school final exams (Abitur) at a relatively young age, in 1943/44 he became a Luftwaffenhelfer (\"loosely: \"air defence assistant\"\"). In 1944 he was enrolled into the National Labour Scheme. Before the end of the year he had been conscripted into the army. He was briefly a member of the Nazi Party. By the time the war ended, in May 1945, he had already been promoted to a junior officer rank.\n\nThe ending of the war brought industrial scale ethnic cleansing to Silesia followed by frontier changes. Berthold found himself relocated to the central portion of Germany, administered now as the Soviet occupation zone. Communist Party membership was no longer outlawed, and early in 1946 he became a youthful member of the re-emerging Communist Party of Germany. He was actively involved in the contentious party merger which led, in April 1946, to the launch of the Socialist Unity Party (\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\" / SED), quickly signing his party membership over to the newly united - albeit effective as such only in the Soviet zone - \"party of the left\". Comrades attest that it was as a result of the education reforms in the emerging communist German state that he was able, almost immediately, to enroll at the Friedrich Schiller University at Jena where he studied History, German studies and Philosophy between 1946 and 1950, emerging with a degree and a Level I teaching qualification.\n\nIn October 1949 the Soviet occupation zone had been relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany), seen by critics as a new kind of German one-party dictatorship, with the SED as its ruling party. Berthold worked between 1950 and 1952 as a research assistant at the party's Karl Marx Academy, located at that time Berlin. The focus of his work was on the history of the German labour movement and, more specifically, on the development of the Communist Party in Germany. In 1952 he added a teaching position at the academy to his research work. He received his doctorate in 1955 for a piece of work (subsequently published as a book) on Communist Party history. In 1960 he passed his habilitation (higher academic qualification) which opened the way to a lifelong academic career. The same year he was appointed to a professorship at the academy.\n\nIn 1962 he was appointed to as position at the Party Central Committee's Institute for Marxism–Leninism, initially as head of the Department for the History of the Labour Movement. He also served, between 1962 and 1964, as a deputy president of the institute. He was promoted in 1964, becoming the institute's president in succession to Roland Bauer. Along with this position, which Berthold held for the next four years, he was appointed a member of the politburo's influential \"Ideology Commission\". Along with his responsibilities at the institute, between 1962 and 1968 Berthold was editor in chief of \"Beiträge zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung\", an academic journal focusing on the history of the labour movement, a topic of considerable importance for the national leadership.\n\nIn 1967 the eldest of the Bertholds' three daughters, Erika-Dorothea, became friendly with Florian Havemann, whose father, Robert Havemann was one of the country's most high-profile (and intellectually brilliant) political dissidents. The crushing of the Prague Spring movement in August 1968 through an invasion by fraternal tanks from around the Warsaw Pact caused unease at many levels in East Germany, but most people kept their doubts to themselves. Nevertheless, a number of young people, including some of the adolescent children of East German intellectuals, such as Thomas Brasch, Florian Havemann and his girl-friend, Erika-Dorothea Berthold, expressed their opposition to the Warsaw Pact intervention through a series of street protests in Berlin. They also painted the name \"Dubcek\" on walls and distributed leaflets spelling out their concerns. After slightly less than three months in investigatory custody, the young people faced trial between 21 and 28 October 1968 and were condemned to prison terms or, in the case of Florian Havemann who was only 16, \"educational measures\". In November 1968 those sentenced to prison terms were released on probabtion because, it was reported, they had displayed \"remorseful insight\" (\"reuevolle Einsicht\"). Erika-Dorothea Berthold was nonetheless prevented from completing her schooling. She was already living with her boy-friend in a commune and was now, despite her stellar academic pedigree, required to train for work as a librarian. Lothar and Erika Berthold (Erika-Dorothea's mother) were appalled. The shock was all the greater because of the prominent part in the protest played by the eldest daughter of a committed academic member of the \"Ideology Commission\". By the end of 1968 Lothar Berthold, as the young protester's father, had been obliged to resign not merely from the commission but also from the presidency of the Institute for Marxism–Leninism and \"associated functions\".\n\nLothar Berthold won the Patriotic Order of Merit in bronze in 1963 and then, after just two years, in silver. A normal progression during the next ten or so years would have been to the gold version of the same award. That never happened, but he did win other - possibly less prestigious - awards from the government over the next couple of decades, and it soon became apparent that removal from the Institute for Marxism–Leninism would not mark the end of his academic career. Between 1969 and 1972 he was employed as an academic research assistant at the Central Institute for History of the (East) German Academy of Sciences and Humanities in central Berlin. Between 1972 and 1976 he served as the institute's deputy director. In 1976 he took over from Werner Mussler as a director of the Akademie Verlag, which was the publishing house affiliated with the academy. He held core operational responsibilities as the publisher's director for printing and publishing. He also served, between 1979 and 1990, as director of the Weimar based business publishing operation which had, in effect, functioned as a subsidiary of the Akademie Verlag since becoming cut off from its Vienna holding company by the so-called \"iron curtain\".\n\nIn 1990, the year when social and political changes led first to the end of East Germany's forty year Soviet-style dictatorship and then to reunification, Lothar Berthold retired on health grounds, stepping down from all his functions. He does indeed appear to have been in poor and declining health during the years that followed. He nevertheless worked actively with the \"Marxist working group on the history of the German labour movement\" (\"Marxistische Arbeitskreis zur Geschichte der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung\") which functioned under the auspices of Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which was emerging as a new formulation, for a democratic Germany, of East Germany's old Socialist Unity Party (SED), which itself was by now widely (though by no means universally) discredited and disparaged. In the context of the working group he co-organised various conferences. He also continued to contribute written works to various left-wing ad communist journals.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1966 Lothar Berthold served as secretary to the authors' collective, mandated to compile and produce an eight-volume history of the German labour movement. The importance of the project is apparent from the identity of the man leading the project, Walter Ulbricht, better known then as now, for his position as the First Party Secretary - the national leader - than as a scholar of history. It was, therefore, not just as an administrator but also as a compiler-editor and author that Berthold operated at the heart of the party's propaganda structure.\n\nAlso worth highlighting in Berthold's two-volume biography of Ernst Thälmann, the hardline Stalinist leader of the Communist Party between 1925 and 1933 who was later killed by the Nazis after eleven years detained in solitary confinement. Comrades attributed great political value to the biography, seen as a reason why Berthold won the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic not once but twice. He was also active for many years as a \"Friend of the Ernst Thälmann Memorial Centre\" (\"im \"Freundeskreis der Ernst-Thälmann-Gedenkstätte\"\") and a regular speaker at events held in the where Thälmann held the last meeting of the Communist Party before the Nazis closed down political pluralism back in 1933.\n\n"}

He was a Calvinist writer of note.\n\nHe was born of poor Protestant parents near Bischofszell, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau. His university career, first at Ingolstadt (1595‑1596), then at Altdorf near Nuremberg (1597‑1598), was cut short by his poverty, from which he suffered all his life, and which was the main cause of his wanderings. In 1598 he found a rich protector in the person of Bartholomaeus Schobinger, of St Gall, by whose liberality he was enabled to study at St Gall (where he first became interested in medieval documents, which abound in the Abbey of St. Gall) and elsewhere in Switzerland. The year before his patron's death in 1604, he became secretary to Henri, duc de Bouillon, with whom he went to Heidelberg and Frankfurt. But in 1604 he entered the service of the Baron von Hohensax, the possessor of the Codex Manesse, the precious manuscript volume of old German \"Minnesänger\" of which Goldast published excerpts. Soon he was back in Switzerland, and by 1606 in Frankfurt, earning his living by preparing and correcting books for the press. In 1611 he was appointed councillor at the court of Saxe-Weimar, and in 1615 he entered the service of Graf Ernst von Schaumburg at Buckeburg. In 1624 he was forced by developments in the Thirty Years War to retire to Bremen; there in 1625 he deposited his library in that of the town, he himself returning to Frankfurt.

{"id": "103155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=103155", "title": "Migration Period", "text": "Migration Period\n\nThe Migration Period, also known as Barbarian invasions in Mediterranean countries, was a period that began as early as 300 AD in which there were widespread migrations of peoples within or into Europe during the decline of the Roman Empire, mostly into Roman territory, notably the Germanic tribes and the Huns. It has also been termed in English by the German loanword and—from the Mediterranean perspective—the Barbarian Invasions. Many of the migrations were movements of Germanic, Hunnic, Slavic and other peoples into the territory of the then declining Roman Empire, with or without accompanying invasions or war.\n\nHistorians give differing dates, but the Migration Period is typically regarded as beginning with the invasion of Europe by the Huns from Asia in 375 and ending either with the conquest of Italy by the Lombards in 568, or at some point between 700 and 800. Various factors contributed to this phenomenon, and the role and significance of each one is still very much discussed among experts on the subject. Starting in 382, the Roman Empire and individual tribes made treaties regarding their settlement in its territory. The Franks, a Germanic tribe that would later found Francia—a predecessor of modern France and Germany—settled in the Roman Empire and were given a task of securing the northeastern Gaul border. Western Roman rule was first violated with the Crossing of the Rhine and the following invasions of the Vandals and Suebi. With wars ensuing between various tribes, as well as local populations in the Western Roman Empire, more and more power was transferred to Germanic and Roman militaries.\n\nThere are contradicting opinions whether the fall of the Western Roman Empire was a result or cause of these migrations, or both. The Eastern Roman Empire was less affected by migrations and survived until the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453. In the modern period, the Migration Period was increasingly described with a rather negative connotation, and seen as contributing to the fall of the empire. In place of the fallen Western Rome, Barbarian kingdoms arose in the 5th and 6th centuries and decisively shaped the European Early Middle Ages.\n\nThe migrants comprised war bands or tribes of 10,000 to 20,000 people, but in the course of 100 years they numbered not more than 750,000 in total, compared to an average 39.9 million population of the Roman Empire at that time. Although immigration was common throughout the time of the Roman Empire, the period in question was, in the 19th century, often defined as running from about the 5th to 8th centuries AD. The first migrations of peoples were made by Germanic tribes such as the Goths (including the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths), the Vandals, the Anglo-Saxons, the Lombards, the Suebi, the Frisii, the Jutes, the Burgundians, the Alemanni, the Scirii and the Franks; they were later pushed westward by the Huns, the Avars, the Slavs and the Bulgars.\n\nLater invasions—such as the Viking, the Norman, the Hungarian, the Moorish, the Turkic and the Mongol—also had significant effects (especially in North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Anatolia and Central and Eastern Europe); however, they are usually considered outside the scope of the Migration Period.\n\nGermanic peoples moved out of southern Scandinavia and northern Germany to the adjacent lands between the Elbe and Oder after 1000 BC. The first wave moved westward and southward (pushing the resident Celts west to the Rhine by about 200 BC), moving into southern Germany up to the Roman provinces of Gaul and Cisalpine Gaul by 100 BC, where they were stopped by Gaius Marius and Julius Caesar. It is this western group which was described by the Roman historian Tacitus (56–117 AD) and Julius Caesar (100–44 BC). A later wave of Germanic tribes migrated eastward and southward from Scandinavia between 600 and 300 BC to the opposite coast of the Baltic Sea, moving up the Vistula near the Carpathians. During Tacitus' era they included lesser known tribes such as the Tencteri, Cherusci, Hermunduri and Chatti; however, a period of federation and intermarriage resulted in the familiar groups known as the Alemanni, Franks, Saxons, Frisians and Thuringians.\n\nThe Barbarian Invasions may be divided into two phases.\nThe first phase, occurring between AD 300 and 500, is partly documented by Greek and Latin historians but difficult to verify archaeologically. It puts Germanic peoples in control of most areas of what was then the Western Roman Empire. The Tervingi entered Roman territory (after a clash with the Huns) in 376. Some time thereafter in Marcianopolis, the escort to Fritigern (their leader) was killed while meeting with Lupicinus. The Tervingi rebelled, and the Visigoths, a group derived either from the Tervingi or from a fusion of mainly Gothic groups, eventually invaded Italy and sacked Rome in 410, before settling in Gaul, and then, 50 years later, in Iberia, founding a kingdom that lasted for 250 years. They were followed into Roman territory first by a confederation of Herulian, Rugian, and Scirian warriors, under Odoacer, that deposed Romulus Augustulus on 4 September 476, and later by the Ostrogoths, led by Theodoric the Great, who settled in Italy. In Gaul, the Franks (a fusion of western Germanic tribes whose leaders had been aligned with Rome since the third century AD) entered Roman lands gradually during the fifth century, and after consolidating power under Childeric and his son Clovis’s decisive victory over Syagrius in 486, established themselves as rulers of northern Roman Gaul. Fending off challenges from the Allemanni, Burgundians, and Visigoths, the Frankish kingdom became the nucleus of what would later become France and Germany. The initial Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain occurred during the fifth century, when Roman control of Britain had come to an end. The Burgundians settled in North Western Italy, Switzerland and Eastern France in the fifth century.\n\nThe second phase took place between 500 and 700 and saw Slavic tribes settling more areas of central Europe and pushing further out into southern and eastern Europe, gradually making the eastern half of the continent predominantly Slavic. Additionally, Turkic tribes such as the Avars became involved in this phase. In 567, the Avars and the Lombards destroyed much of the Gepid Kingdom. The Lombards, a Germanic people, settled in Italy with their Herulian, Suebian, Gepid, Thuringian, Bulgarian, Sarmatian and Saxon allies in the 6th century. They were later followed by the Bavarians and the Franks, who conquered and ruled most of Italy. The Bulgars, originally a nomadic group from Central Asia, had occupied the Pontic steppe north of Caucasus since the second century, but after, pushed by the Khazars, the majority of them migrated west and dominated Byzantine territories along the lower Danube in the seventh century. From this time and onward the demographic picture of the Balkans changed permanently becoming predominantly Slavic, while pockets of native people survived in the mountains of southwest Balkans, Albania and Greece.\n\nDuring the early Byzantine–Arab Wars, Arab armies attempted to invade southeast Europe via Asia Minor during the late seventh and early eighth centuries, but were defeated at the siege of Constantinople (717–718) by the joint forces of Byzantium and the Bulgars. During the Khazar–Arab Wars, the Khazars stopped the Arab expansion into Europe across the Caucasus (7th and 8th centuries). At the same time, the Moors (consisting of Arabs and Berbers) invaded Europe via Gibraltar (conquering Hispania—the Iberian Peninsula—from the Visigothic Kingdom in 711), before being halted. These battles broadly demarcated the frontiers between Christendom and Islam for the next millennium. The following centuries saw the Muslims successful in conquering most of Sicily from the Christians by 902.\n\nThe Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin from around 895 and the following Hungarian invasions of Europe, and the Viking expansion from the late 8th century conventionally mark the last large movements of the period. Christianity gradually converted the non-Islamic newcomers and integrated them into the medieval Christian order. After that, the German eastward expansion (german: \"(Deutsche) Ostsiedlung\") started in the 11th century in Eastern Europe.\n\nA number of contemporary historical references worldwide refer to an extended period of extreme weather during 535–536. Evidence of this cold period is also found in dendrochronology and ice cores. The consequences of this cold period are debated.\nAnalysis of barbarian identity and how it was created and expressed during the Barbarian Invasions has elicited discussion among scholars. Herwig Wolfram, a historian of the Goths, in discussing the equation of \"migratio gentium\" with \"\", observes that Michael Schmidt introduced the equation in his 1778 history of the Germans. Wolfram observed that the significance of \"gens\" as a biological community was shifting, even during the early Middle Ages and that \"to complicate matters, we have no way of devising a terminology that is not derived from the concept of nationhood created during the French Revolution\".\n\nThe \"primordialistic\" paradigm prevailed during the 19th century. Scholars, such as German linguist Johann Gottfried Herder, viewed tribes as coherent biological (racial) entities, using the term to refer to discrete ethnic groups. He also believed that the \"Volk\" were an organic whole, with a core identity and spirit evident in art, literature and language. These characteristics were seen as intrinsic, unaffected by external influences, even conquest. Language, in particular, was seen as the most important expression of ethnicity. They argued that groups sharing the same (or similar) language possessed a common identity and ancestry. This was the Romantic ideal that there once had been a single German, Celtic or Slavic people who originated from a common homeland and spoke a common tongue, helping to provide a conceptual framework for political movements of the 18th and 19th centuries such as Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism.\n\nFrom the 1960s, a reinterpretation of archaeological and historic evidence prompted scholars, such as Goffart and Todd, to propose new models for explaining the construction of barbarian identity. They maintained that no sense of shared identity was perceived by the \"Germani\"; a similar theory having been proposed for Celtic and Slavic groups.\n\nA theory states that the primordialist mode of thinking was encouraged by a \"prima facie\" interpretation of Graeco-Roman sources, which grouped together many tribes under such labels as \"Germanoi\", \"Keltoi\" or \"Sclavenoi\", thus encouraging their perception as distinct peoples. Modernists argue that the uniqueness perceived by specific groups was based on common political and economic interests rather than biological or racial distinctions.\n\nThe role of language in constructing and maintaining group identity can be ephemeral since large-scale language shifts occur commonly in history. Modernists propose the idea of \"imagined communities\"; the barbarian polities in late antiquity were social constructs rather than unchanging lines of blood kinship. The process of forming tribal units was called \"ethnogenesis\", a term coined by Soviet scholar Yulian Bromley. The Austrian school (led by Reinhard Wenskus) popularized this idea, which influenced medievalists such as Herwig Wolfram, Walter Pohl and Patrick Geary. It argues that the stimulus for forming tribal polities was perpetuated by a small nucleus of people, known as the \"\" (\"kernel of tradition\"), who were a military or aristocratic elite. This core group formed a standard for larger units, gathering adherents by employing amalgamative metaphors such as kinship and aboriginal commonality and claiming that they perpetuated an ancient, divinely-sanctioned lineage.\n\nThe common, track-filled map of the \"\" may illustrate such [a] course of events, but it misleads. Unfolded over long periods of time, the changes of position that took place were necessarily irregular ... (with) periods of emphatic discontinuity. For decades and possibly centuries, the tradition bearers idled, and the tradition itself hibernated. There was ample time for forgetfulness to do its work.\n\nHistorians have postulated several explanations for the appearance of \"barbarians\" on the Roman frontier: weather and crops, population pressure, a \"primeval urge\" to push into the Mediterranean or the \"domino effect\" of the Huns falling upon the Goths who, in turn, pushed other Germanic tribes before them. Entire barbarian tribes (or nations) flooded into Roman provinces, ending classical urbanism and beginning new types of rural settlements. In general, French and Italian scholars have tended to view this as a catastrophic event, the destruction of a civilization and the beginning of a \"Dark Age\" that set Europe back a millennium. In contrast, German and English historians have tended to see Roman/Barbarian interaction as the replacement of a \"tired, effete and decadent Mediterranean civilization\" with a \"more virile, martial, Nordic one\".\n\nRather than \"invasion\", German and Slavic scholars speak of \"migration\" (, , and ), aspiring to the idea of a dynamic and \"wandering Indo-Germanic people\".\n\nThe scholar Guy Halsall has seen the barbarian movement as the result of the fall of the Roman Empire, not its cause. Archaeological finds have confirmed that Germanic and Slavic tribes were settled agriculturalists who were probably merely \"drawn into the politics of an empire already falling apart for quite a few other causes\". The Crisis of the Third Century caused significant changes within the Roman Empire in both its western and its eastern portions. In particular, economic fragmentation removed many of the political, cultural and economic forces that had held the empire together.\n\nThe rural population in Roman provinces became distanced from the metropolis, and there was little to differentiate them from other peasants across the Roman frontier. In addition, Rome increasingly used foreign mercenaries to defend itself. That \"barbarisation\" parallelled changes within \"barbaricum\".\n\nFor example, the Roman Empire played a vital role in building up barbarian groups along its frontier. Propped up with imperial support and gifts, the armies of allied barbarian chieftains served as buffers against other, hostile, barbarian groups. The disintegration of Roman economic power weakened groups that had come to depend on Roman gifts for the maintenance of their own power. The arrival of the Huns helped prompt many groups to invade the provinces for economic reasons.\n\nThe nature of the barbarian takeover of former Roman provinces varied from region to region. For example, in Aquitaine, the provincial administration was largely self-reliant. Halsall has argued that local rulers simply \"handed over\" military rule to the Ostrogoths, acquiring the identity of the newcomers. In Gaul, the collapse of imperial rule resulted in anarchy: the Franks and Alemanni were pulled into the ensuing \"power vacuum\", resulting in conflict. In Spain, local aristocrats maintained independent rule for some time, raising their own armies against the Vandals. Meanwhile, the Roman withdrawal from Lowland England resulted in conflict between Saxons and the Brythonic chieftains (whose centres of power retreated westward as a result). The Eastern Roman Empire attempted to maintain control of the Balkan provinces despite a thinly-spread imperial army relying mainly on local militias and an extensive effort to refortify the Danubian \"limes\". The ambitious fortification efforts collapsed, worsening the impoverished conditions of the local populace and resulting in colonization by Slavic warriors and their families.\n\nHalsall and Noble have argued that such changes stemmed from the breakdown in Roman political control, which exposed the weakness of local Roman rule. Instead of large-scale migrations, there were military takeovers by small groups of warriors and their families, who usually numbered only in the tens of thousands. The process involved active, conscious decision-making by Roman provincial populations.\n\nThe collapse of centralized control severely weakened the sense of Roman identity in the provinces, which may explain why the provinces then underwent dramatic cultural changes even though few barbarians settled in them.\n\nUltimately, the Germanic groups in the Western Roman Empire were accommodated without \"dispossessing or overturning indigenous society\", and they maintained a structured and hierarchical (but attenuated) form of Roman administration.\n\nIronically, they lost their unique identity as a result of such an accommodation and were absorbed into Latinhood. In contrast, in the east, Slavic tribes maintained a more \"spartan and egalitarian\" existence bound to the land \"even in times when they took their part in plundering Roman provinces\". Their organizational models were not Roman, and their leaders were not normally dependent on Roman gold for success. Thus they arguably had a greater effect on their region than the Goths, the Franks or the Saxons had on theirs.\n\nBased on the belief that particular types of artifacts, elements of personal adornment generally found in a funerary context, are thought to indicate the race and/or ethnicity of the person buried, the \"Culture-History\" school of archaeology assumed that archaeological cultures represent the \"\" (homeland) of tribal polities named in historical sources. As a consequence, the shifting extensions of material cultures were interpreted as the expansion of peoples.\n\nInfluenced by constructionism, process-driven archaeologists rejected the Culture-Historical doctrine and marginalized the discussion of ethnicity altogether and focused on the intragroup dynamics that generated such material remains. Moreover, they argued that adoption of new cultures could occur through trade or internal political developments rather than only military takeovers.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the author of many books about Islam.\n\nProfessor Emeritus at University of Tunis, Mohamed Talbi was a Tunisian historian, Islamologist and scholar who authored a number of books and articles on the history of Islam and the Maghreb. Born in Tunis in 1921 and educated there and later in Paris, Talbi had an illustrious career, both as a historian of medieval North Africa and as a major theoretical thinker on Islam's nature and mission in the modern world. \n\nAmong Talbi's modern interests were religion and politics, Islam and democracy, Islam and human rights, women in Islam and Islam and religious pluralism, in the wider context of his general thinking on Qur'anic exegesis, historical analysis and religious epistemology. In his discussions of these subjects, Talbi made clear his dependence on the Quran and other traditional religious sources, while evincing also an easy incorporation of certain modern Western Ideas. Indeed, Talbi's own description of his upbringing and education in Tunisia, and in particular his doctoral studies in post-War Paris, reflected a relaxed attitude towards synthesising Islamic and modern Western thought, in both of which he possessed the requisite learning to effect such an integration. Talbi died on 1 May 2017.\n\nMohamed Talbi devoted the best part of his career to teaching and researching medieval Maghreb and Mediterranean history. His profile was that of an atypical intellectual. After a long career teaching in primary and secondary schools, Talbi took and passed the Arab Studies competitive examination. On the eve of Tunisia's independence, he joined the Institute of Higher Education of Tunis. In 1955, he became the first Dean of the School of Letter and Human Sciences of Tunis. He also chaired the school's history departement before devoting his full energies as director of the scientific journal \"\". \n\nIn 1968, Talbi defended his Ph.D. thesis at the Sorbonne. Entitled \"The Aghlabid Emirate, a political History\", it discusses Tunisia's first Muslim dynasty. Written with clarity and a forcefulness of expression, and supported by solid Arab and Latin sources, Talbi's thesis contributed greatly to a renewed understanding of a key period in the history of Ifriqiya and eastern Maghreb and the region's relationships with southern Italy. It also earned Talbi a place as one of the founders of the new school of Tunisian and Maghreb history.\n\nProlix and incisive, Talbi wrote a considerable number of articles and essays. He was one of a rare few to have addressed the history of slavery, and the key role played by slaves, in agriculture and economy. \n\nNear the end of the 1990s, Talbi turned his reflections toward a deep and systematic meditation. His small book called \"Universality of the Quran\" is a lucid essay of synthesis and analysis. It is primarily in Talbi's latest writing that the historian adopted the style of a polemicist. Talbi was appointed president of the Tunisian Academy of Sciences, Letters, and Arts between 2011 and 2012.\n\nTalbi rejected the direct association between Shura and democracy. He argues that, while desirable in itself, shura is from a time and place which had no conception of democracy as we know it. Indeed, says Talbi, neither Islam nor Western civilisation had this democratic conception before the modern period, when democracy, as political idea and practice was born- at least not democracy in our modern meaning of the term. For Talbi, democracy meant the voice of the people determining who rules and how they rule, with the associated notions of universal human rights, freedom of expression, religious pluralism and equality before the law. True democracy was for Talbi the proper political form for our age, as it embodies those values which for him constitute part of the original true Islam.\n\nDuring thirty years, Talbi has participated in a number of official and personal dialogues with Christians in North Africa and Europe. In an article on Islam and the West, published in 1987, he complains about the current poverty of Muslim initiatives or even responses to Euro-Arab or Islamo-Christian dialogue. In a prochure on the subject, he explicitly declared Islam to be open to dialogue with other faiths and cultures. For Talbi, the Muslim-Christian dialogue is not just a social event but a significant religious matter, and he has done everything possible to promote such dialogue in Tunisia and elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n"}

An archetypal nasal sound is .\n\nIn the International Phonetic Alphabet, nasalization is indicated by printing a tilde diacritic above the symbol for the sound to be nasalized: is the nasalized equivalent of , and is the nasalized equivalent of . A subscript diacritic , called an ogonek or nosinė, is sometimes seen, especially when the vowel bears tone marks that would interfere with the superscript tilde. For example, are more legible in most fonts than .\n\nNasal vowels are found in various languages around the world, such as French, Polish, Portuguese, Breton, Hindi, Hmong, Hokkien, Yoruba and Cherokee. Those nasal vowels contrast with oral vowels. Many languages, however, have only oral vowels or do not contrast oral and nasal vowels.\n\nThere are occasional cases for vowels showing contrasting degrees of nasality.. One such is Palantla Chinantec.\n\nBy far the most common nasal sounds are nasal consonants such as , or . Most nasal consonants are occular, and airflow through the mouth is blocked and redirected through the nose. Their oral counterparts are the stops.\n\nNasalized versions of other consonant sounds also exist but are much rarer than either nasal occlusives or nasal vowels. Some South Arabian languages use phonemic nasalized fricatives, such as , which sounds something like a simultaneous and . The Chinese consonant 日 \"r\"- () has an odd history; for example, it has evolved into and (or and respectively, depending on accents) in Standard Chinese; / and in Hokkien; / and / while borrowed into Japan. It seems likely that it was once a nasalized fricative, perhaps a palatal .\n\nIn Coatzospan Mixtec, fricatives and affricates are nasalized before nasal vowels even when they are voiceless. In the Hupa, the velar nasal often has the tongue not make full contact, resulting in a nasalized approximant, . That is cognate with a nasalized palatal approximant] in other Athabaskan languages.\n\nIn Umbundu, phonemic contrasts with the (allophonically) nasalized approximate and so is likely to be a true fricative rather than an approximate. In Old and Middle Irish, the lenited was a nasalized bilabial fricative.\n\nSundanese has an allophonic nasalized glottal stop ; nasalized stops can occur only with pharyngeal articulation or lower, or they would be simple nasals. Nasal flaps are common allophonically. Many West African languages have a nasal flap (or ) as an allophone of before a nasal vowel; Pashto, however, has a phonemic nasal retroflex lateral flap.\n\nOther languages, such as the Khoisan languages of Khoekhoe and Gǀui, as well as several of the !Kung languages, include nasal click consonants. Nasalization of the phonemes is denoted with a superscript preceding the consonant (for example, ). Nasalized laterals such as are easy to produce but rare or nonexistent as phonemes; often when is nasalized, it becomes .\n\nBesides nasalized oral fricatives, there are true nasal fricatives, previously called \"nareal fricatives\". They are sometimes produced by people with disordered speech. The turbulence in the airflow characteristic of fricatives is produced not in the mouth but in the nasal cavity. A tilde and trema diacritic (two dots representing the nostrils) is used for this in the extensions to the IPA: is a voiced alveolar nasal fricative, with no airflow out of the mouth, and is the voiceless equivalent; is an oral fricative with simultaneous nasal frication. No known language makes use of nasal fricatives in non-disordered speech.\n\nNasalization may be lost over time. There are also denasal sounds, which sound like nasals spoken with a head cold. They may be found in non-pathological speech as a language loses nasal consonants, as in Korean.\n\nVowels assimilate to surrounding nasal consonants in many languages, such as Thai, creating nasal vowel allophones. Some languages exhibit a nasalization of segments adjacent to phonemic or allophonic nasal vowels, such as Apurinã.\n\nContextual nasalization can lead to the addition of nasal vowel phonemes to a language. That happened in French, most of whose final consonants disappeared, but its final nasals made the preceding vowels become nasal, which introduced a new distinction into the language. An example is \"vin blanc\" ('white wine'), ultimately from Latin \"vinum\" and \"blancum\".\n\n"}

He refers to himself as \"Petro Olavo Saneropio Minoritano\" in a colophon of his Collectanea ad historiam danicam pertinentia. A later note in the same manuscript by Anders Sørensen Vedel (fol. 171v) suggests that he was dead by c. 1570.\n\nHe was presumably a monk in Roskilde monastery, for which reason Lyschander (ca. 1620) refers to him as \"Petrus Olai Roschildensis\". The byname \"Saneropius\" refers to Sonnerup parish (now in Lejre Municipality), some 10 km west of Roskilde.\n\nPetrus likely began his \"Collectanea\" in c. 1515, when he was still a young monk, as a personal notebook.\nFrom c. 1522, he was employed by his order to write a chronicle about the Franciscans in Scandinavia. After the Reformation (in 1537) the order was dissolved in Denmark, but Petrus continued his work on Danish history until c. 1560, as Danorum Gesta.\n\nThe manuscript of \"Collectanea ad historiam danicam pertinentia\" (AM 107 8°, 172 folia) is a notebook with complicated structure, extended by numerous extra pages and loose slips of paper, and numerous interlinear and marginal notes, and has never been edited in its entirety.\nThe \"Danorum Gesta\", on the other hand, is a coherent text. It is extant in the manuscripts Uppsala University Library DG 37, 86 folia, and Copenhagen, Royal Library, GKS 2461 4° (92 folia).\nIt treats the history of Denmark from 1191 to 1559, but it contains little original information.\nThe two manuscripts contain the same text from 1319, with only the Uppsala ms. containing the portion of 1191 to 1318. Both are near-contemporary copies but not autographs.\nThe greater part of the text consists of excerpts from the \"Collectanea\"; the \"Gesta\" is, in fact, the systematic synthesis of the material collected over the years in his notebook. It represents the first effort at a coherent \"Continuation of Saxo\", as presented with more lasting influence (and in print) by Arild Hvidtfeldt in 1600.\n\nThe \"Colectanea\" were extensively used by other historians already during Petrus' lifetime, notably by Paulus Helie for his \"Skiby-chronicle\", by Hans Svaning and by Anders Sørensen Vedel who inherited the \"Colectanea\" ms. after Petrus' death. Arne Magnusson acquired the ms. in 1726 and partial editions of the texts were published in \"Scriptores rerum Danicarum\" by Jakob Langebek beginning in 1772.\n\nThe \"Danorum Gesta\" was translated in part (for the period 1448–1559) into Danish, as the \"Roskilde-årbogen\", which would be very influential in the decades leading up to the publication of Arild Hvidtfeldt's \"Danske Krønike\" in 1600.\n\n"}

He was a founding member of the People's National Party (PNP) and one of the pioneers of Marxism in Jamaica. He played an important role in Jamaican politics in the years leading up to Independence in 1962. He subsequently was based in Guyana for two years, before relocating to London in 1965, working as a solicitor and co-founding the campaigning organisation Caribbean Labour Solidarity. He went on to serve as attorney-general in Grenada under the People's Revolutionary Government in 1983. He spent the latter years of his life in the UK, where he died in Bristol.\n\nHart was the author of several notable books on Caribbean history – including \"Towards Decolonisation: Political, Labour and Economic Developments in Jamaica 1939–1945\" (1999), \"Slaves who Abolished Slavery: Blacks in Rebellion\" (2002) and \"The Grenada Revolution: Setting the Record Straight\" (2005) – and he lectured on the subject at universities in the West Indies, the US, Canada and Europe. Rupert Lewis once called him \"the most consistent Caribbean activist\".\n\nRichard Hart was born in Montego Bay, Jamaica, on 13 August 1917, of mixed heritage that included Sephardic Jewish and African. He was the son of Ansell Hart, a Jamaican solicitor and author of a 1972 historical study of George William Gordon. Hart was educated in Jamaica and in England, where he was sent to boarding-school at Denstone College in Staffordshire.\n\nHe returned to Jamaica in 1937, and became a founding member of the People's National Party (PNP) in 1938; he was on the party's Executive Committee from 1941 to 1952. He had the responsibility of drafting a model trade union constitution as a member of Norman Manley's 1938 Labour Committee assisting Alexander Bustamante in the formation of a trade union, and in 1940 was arrested for organising a demonstration demanding Bustamante's release from prison. Hart sat the English Law Society examinations in Jamaica, qualifying as a solicitor in 1941. In 1942 he was imprisoned without trial by the British colonial government for his political activities.\n\nIn 1954, Hart – who self-identified as a Marxist – was one of four PNP members who were expelled from the PNP for their (alleged) communist views. The other three members were Frank Hill, Ken Hill and Arthur Henry, and they were collectively referred to as \"the four Hs\". Hart was also very active in the trade union movement in Jamaica in the 1940s and 1950s, and worked as a member of the Executive Committee of the Trade Union Council from 1946 to 1948. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Caribbean Labour Congress from 1945 to 1946 and Assistant Secretary from 1947 to 1953.\n\nBelieving in the importance of popular education to empower people and raise the level of political consciousness in the community – to which his first book, \"The Origin and Development of the People of Jamaica\" (1952), was dedicated – Hart helped establish the People's Educational Organisation (PEO), which organized a bookshop and held meetings and debates, including on the type of political party that was needed. Together with other radical thinkers and activists he then formed the People's Freedom Movement (which was later renamed the Socialist Party of Jamaica). The party disbanded in 1962.\n\nAfter the demise of the People's Freedom Movement, Hart moved to Guyana, where he worked as the editor of \"The Mirror\" newspaper, which supported the views of Cheddi Jagan, from 1963 to 1965. While in Guyana, Hart also undertook research into the history and culture of the Arawak people, making many visits to Amerindian communities in the interior. After returning to the UK Hart initiated a correspondence with Canon John P. Bennett – the first Arawak priest to be ordained as an Anglican priest – and worked to assist in the writing and publication of an Arawak-English Dictionary. The letters exchanged between Hart and Bennett would eventually be published in 1991, in a book entitled \"Kabethechino\" (\"Close Friends\"), edited by Janette Forte of the University of Guyana.\n\nOn leaving Guyana, Hart moved to London, England, where he worked as a solicitor to a Local Government Authority from 1965 to 1982. In 1974, he was a founding member of Caribbean Labour Solidarity (CLS), together with Cleston Taylor (1926–2010), Lionel Jeffrey (1926–93) and others. Hart remained the Honorary President of CLS, a group that \"sets itself the task of informing the concerned about labour issues in the region as a whole\".\n\nIn 1982, Hart moved to Grenada, where he worked as a legal consultant to the People's Revolutionary Government. He was appointed Attorney General of Grenada on 25 May 1983. An internal power struggle in the leadership of the New Jewel Movement led to the killing of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and the US Invasion of Grenada that began on 25 October 1983.\n\nHart returned to England, where he operated a private legal practice for five years until he retired in 1988. He contributed an introduction to \"In Nobody's Backyard: Maurice Bishop's Speeches, 1979–1983 – A Memorial Volume\" (Zed Books, 1984), placing the Grenada revolution in a historical context within the Caribbean, and later wrote other works on Grenada, including \"The Grenada Revolution: Setting the Record Straight\" (2005).\n\nHart was readmitted to the PNP in 2001. In 2004, he was awarded an honorary degree by the University of the West of England. In 2005, he was presented with a Gold Musgrave Medal from the Institute of Jamaica for his \"sterling contribution and achievements in the field of historical research both in Jamaica and the Caribbean\", and was awarded an honorary doctorate by The University of the West Indies (UWI). In June 2006, UWI ran a three-day conference on Hart's work, entitled \"Politics, Activism and History: The Life and Times of Richard Hart\". In 2011, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Hull.\n\nHart wrote a number of significant historical works over the years. He was also instrumental in the publication of the first Arawak dictionary in 1991. His 1999 title \"Towards Decolonisation: Political, Labour and Economic Developments in Jamaica 1938–1945\" was described by Linden Lewis in a review as: \"a meticulously documented text about the struggle for decolonization, union recognition, and the establishment of an indigenous political party in Jamaica during the War years. The text is part memoir and part historical account. As a major participant in the labor and political struggles of the 1930s and 1940s, Hart was both observer and actor in the unfolding drama of the process of decolonization.\" Hart's 2012 book, \"Caribbean Workers' Struggles\", \"is a wide-ranging and immensely readable essay that gives centre stage to the struggle for workers' rights and national independence against the forces of racism and imperialism.\" \"Socialist Review\" states: \"This book is testimony to the courageous and unceasing struggle from below that won freedom and political rights for a population of slaves.\" His last published book was \"Occupation & Control: the British in Jamaica 1660–1962\" (2013).\n\nHart died aged 96 at his home in Bristol on 21 December 2013.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On a field trip to the area where they were found in 2014 he discovered what he considered evidence of further inscriptions made up of large rocks regularly spaced and what he called “a man-made platform of megalithic construction\" and something that “appeared to be a carved chair or throne.” Sitting on it he “sensed a harmony and that I was in the midst of an ancient time calculating device\". He returned to what he called an \"observatory complex\" with caver including royal burials in June 2014 with a group of researchers who examined the site and stated that “We confirmed most of the things I’d found as potential alignments, and we confirmed that there was artifact evidence in the area that showed human occupation.” He reported this in a talk to the New York Explorers Club later that year, saying that he believed he had found an unknown civilization. \n\nReports from Chinese researchers who accompanied him were less positive. Dr. Ye Xiaohong reported that \"Two suspected cave tombs are not man-made,\" \"No artificial traces were found on the huge stone in the suspected artificial remains, neither the suspected structures for observation nor the suspected ancient topographic maps\" and that what Gosline had interpreted as ancient writing on some rocks \"were certainly produced by natural force\". The Chinese researchers also surveyed the alignments that Gosline thought related to the chair (which they agreed was a natural water-created formation) and concluded that the stone could not have been used as part of an observatory. \n\nAnother Chinese researcher who was part of Gosline's group stated that \"Gosline proclaimed that he had found several megalithic sites including observatories, palaces, and ancient cave tombs，petro-glyphs and even plan maps at Gansang, Nadou, and Bupeng in Pingguo county, Guangxi\". The conclusion was that \"We have not found any artificial remains, artifacts, and occupation layer both at Nadou and Bupeng sites\" and that most of the \"scratches, the petro-glyphs and plan maps on the rocks called by Gosline, are natural\" with a few that might be artificial and needed microscopic examination. However they did believe that the \"Gansang site might have worked as an important settlement in Youjiang River Reach.\" Commenting on the engraved stones reported by Gosline, they commented that they seemed too new, that they were too intact with \"the whole texts just fit to the sizes of the planks\", that they lacked an archaeological context and that there were too few repetitions of characters.\n\nGosline’s observation that the newly discovered inscriptions seemed to include Persian cuneiform is unproven as of 2016.\n"}

These various espionage networks had contact with various U.S. government agencies, transmitting to Moscow information that would have been deemed confidential.\n\nDuring the 1920s Soviet intelligence focused on military and industrial espionage in the United States, specifically in the aircraft and munitions industries, and penetrating the mainline federal government bureaucracies, such as the United States Department of State and War Department. These efforts had mixed results.\n\nOne chief aim was the infiltration, placement, and subversion of American political life at all levels of society. Earl Browder, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), served as an agent recruiter himself on behalf of Soviet intelligence.\n\nBrowder later stated that \"by the mid-thirties, the Party was not putting its principal emphasis on recruiting members.\" Left unstated was his intent to use party members for espionage work, where suitable. Browder advocated the use of a \"United Front\" involving other members of the left, both to strengthen advocacy of pro-Soviet policy and to enlarge the pool of potential recruits for espionage work. The illegal residency of NKVD in the US was established in 1934 by the former Berlin resident Boris Bazarov. In 1935, NKVD agent Iskhak Akhmerov entered the US with false identity papers to assist Bazarov in the collection of useful intelligence, and operated without interruption until 1939, when he left the US. Akhmerov's wife, an American who worked for Soviet intelligence, was Helen Lowry (Elza Akhmerova), the niece of CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder. Recent information from Soviet archives has revealed that Browder's younger sister Marguerite worked until 1938 as an NKVD operative in Europe. She discontinued this work only when Browder himself requested her release from duty, fearful that her work would compromise his position as General Secretary.\n\nIn the 1930s, the chief Soviet espionage organization operating in the U.S. became the GRU. J. Peters headed the secret apparatus that supplied internal government documents from the Ware group to the GRU. Browder assisted Peters in building a network of operatives in the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This group included Alger Hiss, John Abt, and Lee Pressman. Courier for the group at the time was Whittaker Chambers. Browder oversaw the efforts of Jacob Golos and his girlfriend, Elizabeth Bentley, whose network of agents and sources included two key figures at the Department of Treasury, Nathan Gregory Silvermaster and Harry Dexter White.\n\nOne early Soviet spy ring was headed by Jacob Golos. Jake Golos (birth name Jacob Golosenko, Tasin, Rasin or Raisen) was a Ukrainian-born Bolshevik revolutionary and Soviet secret police (NKVD) operative in the USSR. He was also a longtime senior official of the CPUSA involved in covert work and cooperation with Soviet intelligence agencies. He took over an existing network of agents and intelligence sources from Earl Browder. Golos' controller was the head of the NKVD's American desk, Gaik Ovakimian, also known as \"The Puppetmaster\", who would later serve a key role in the assassination of Leon Trotsky. Golos was the \"main pillar\" of the NKVD intelligence network. He had worked with Soviet intelligence from the mid-1930s, and probably earlier. He was not merely a CPUSA official assisting the NKVD (an agent or \"probationer\" in Soviet intelligence parlance) but held official rank in the NKVD, and claimed to be an oldtime Chekist.\n\nGolos established a company called \"World Tourists\" with money from Earl Browder, the General Secretary. The firm, which posed as a travel agency, was used to facilitate international travel to and from the United States by Soviet agents and CPUSA members. World Tourists was also involved in manufacturing fake passports, as Browder used such a false passport on covert trips to the Soviet Union in 1936. At World Tourist, Golos frequently met Bernard Schuster, an NKVD agent (code name \"ECHO\" and \"DICK\") and Communist Party functionary who carried out background investigations for Golos as part of the vetting process of agent candidates. In March 1940, Golos pleaded guilty to being an unregistered foreign agent, paid a $500 fine, and served probation in lieu of a four-month prison sentence.\n\nSoviet intelligence did not like Golos' refusal to allow Soviet contact with his sources (a measure implemented by Golos to protect himself and to ensure his continued retention by the NKVD). The NKVD suspected Golos of Trotskyism and tried to lure him to Moscow, where he could be arrested, but the US government got to him first. But even then, he did not reveal his agent network. After Browder went to prison in 1940, Golos took over running Browder's agents. In 1941, Golos set up a commercial forwarding enterprise, called the US Shipping and Service Corporation, with Elizabeth Bentley, his lover, as one of its officers.\n\nSometime in November 1943, Golos met in New York City with key figures of the Perlo group, a group working in several government departments and agencies in Washington, D.C. The group was already in the service of Browder. Later that same month, after a series of heart attacks over the previous two years, Golos died in bed in Bentley's arms. Bentley then took over his operations (thus the reference in the decrypts to him as a \"former\" colleague).\n\nBy the end of 1936 at least four mid-level State Department officials were delivering information to Soviet intelligence: Alger Hiss, assistant to Assistant Secretary of State Francis Sayre; Julian Wadleigh, economist in the Trade Agreements Section; Laurence Duggan, Latin American division; and Noel Field, West European division. Whittaker Chambers later testified that the plans for a tank design with a revolutionary new suspension invented by J. Walter Christie (then being tested in the U.S.A.) were procured and put into production in the Soviet Union as the Mark BT, later developed into the famous Soviet T-34 tank.\n\nIn 1993, experts from the Library of Congress traveled to Moscow to copy previously secret archives of Communist Party USA (CPUSA) records, sent to the Soviet Union for safekeeping by party organizers. The records provide an irrefutable record of Soviet intelligence and cooperation provided by those in the radical left in the United States from the 1920s through the 1940s. Some documents revealed that the CPUSA was actively involved in secretly recruiting party members from African-American groups and rural farm workers. The records contained further evidence that Soviet sympathizers had indeed infiltrated the State Department, beginning in the 1930s. Included were letters from two U.S. ambassadors in Europe to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and a senior State Department official. Thanks to an official in the State department sympathetic to the Party, the confidential correspondence, concerning political and economic matters in Europe, ended up in the hands of Soviet intelligence.\n\nIn the late 1930s and 1940 the OGPU, known as the Political Directorate, used the U.S. as one of several staging areas for multiple OGPU plots to murder exiled Soviet leader Leon Trotsky, then living in Mexico City. It was American Communists who infiltrated Trotsky's killer, the Catalan Ramón Mercader, into his own household. They were also central to the NKVD's unsuccessful efforts to free the killer from a Mexican prison. \n\nJacob Albam and the Sobles (Jack and Myra) were indicted on espionage charges by the FBI in 1957, all three were later convicted and served prison terms. The Zlatovskis remained in Paris, France, where the laws did not allow their extradition to the United States for espionage. Robert Soblen was sentenced to life in prison for his espionage work at Sandia National Laboratories, but jumped bail and escaped to Israel. After being expelled from that country, he later committed suicide in Great Britain while awaiting extradition back to the United States.\n\nDuring the second world war, Soviet espionage agents obtained classified reports on electronic advances in radio-beacon artillery fuses by Emerson Radio, including a complete proximity fuse (reportedly the same fuse design that was later installed on Soviet anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down Francis Gary Powers's U-2 in 1960). Thousands of documents from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) were photocopied or stolen, including a complete set of design and production drawings for Lockheed Aircraft's new P-80 Shooting Star fighter jet.\n\nJoseph Stalin directed Soviet intelligence officers to collect information in four main areas. Pavel Fitin, the 34-year-old chief of the KGB First Directorate, was directed to seek American intelligence concerning Hitler's plans for the war in Russia; secret war aims of London and Washington, particularly with regard to planning for Operation Overlord, the second front in Europe; any indications the Western Allies might be willing to make a separate peace with Hitler; and American scientific and technological progress, particularly in the development of an atomic weapon.\n\nThe United States Treasury Department was successfully penetrated by nearly a dozen Soviet agents or information sources, including Harold Glasser and his superior, Harry Dexter White, assistant secretary of the treasury and the second most influential official in the department. In Late May 1941 Vitaly Pavlov, a 25-year-old NKVD officer, approached White and attempted to secure his assistance to influence U.S. policy towards Japan. White agreed to assist Soviet intelligence in any way he could. The principal function of White was to aid in the infiltration and placement of Soviet operatives within the government, and protecting sources. When security concerns arose around Nathan Gregory Silvermaster, White protected him in his sensitive position at the Board of Economic Warfare. White likewise was a purveyor of information and resources to assist Soviet aims, and agreed to press for release of German occupation currency plates to the Soviet Union. The Soviets later used the plates to print unrestricted sums of money to exchange for U.S. and Allied hard goods.\n\nIn August 1945 Elizabeth Bentley, fearful of assassination by the Soviet MGB, turned herself in to the government. She implicated many agents and sources in the Golos and Silvermaster spy networks, and was the first to accuse Harry Dexter White of acting on behalf of Soviet interests in releasing occupation plates to Moscow, later confirmed by Soviet archives and former KGB officers.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9835 of 22 March 1947 tightened protections against subversive infiltration of the US Government, defining disloyalty as membership on a list of subversive organizations maintained by the Attorney General. Truman, however, was opposed to the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950, calling it a \"Mockery of the Bill of Rights\" and a \"long step towards totalitarianism\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "795212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=795212", "title": "Terra sigillata", "text": "Terra sigillata\n\nTerra sigillata is a term with at least three distinct meanings: as a description of medieval medicinal earth; in archaeology, as a general term for some of the fine red Ancient Roman pottery with glossy surface slips made in specific areas of the Roman Empire; and more recently, as a description of a contemporary studio pottery technique supposedly inspired by ancient pottery. Usually roughly translated as 'sealed earth', the meaning of 'terra sigillata' is 'clay bearing little images' (Latin \"sigilla\"), not 'clay with a sealed (impervious) surface'. The archaeological term is applied, however, to plain-surfaced pots as well as those decorated with figures in relief.\n\nTerra sigillata as an archaeological term refers chiefly to a specific type of plain and decorated tableware made in Italy and in Gaul (France and the Rhineland) during the Roman Empire. These vessels have glossy surface slips ranging from a soft lustre to a brilliant glaze-like shine, in a characteristic colour range from pale orange to bright red; they were produced in standard shapes and sizes and were manufactured on an industrial scale and widely exported. The sigillata industries grew up in areas where there were existing traditions of pottery manufacture, and where the clay deposits proved suitable. The products of the Italian workshops are also known as Aretine ware from Arezzo and have been collected and admired since the Renaissance. The wares made in the Gaulish factories are often referred to by English-speaking archaeologists as samian ware. Closely related pottery fabrics made in the North African and Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire are not usually referred to as terra sigillata, but by more specific names, e.g. African red slip wares. All these types of pottery are significant for archaeologists: they can often be closely dated, and their distribution casts light on aspects of the ancient Roman economy.\n\nModern \"Terra sig\" should be clearly distinguished from the close reproductions of Roman wares made by some potters deliberately recreating and using the Roman methods. The finish called 'terra sigillata' by studio potters can be made from most clay, mixed as a very thin liquid slip and settled to separate out only the finest particles to be used as terra sigillata. When applied to unfired clay surfaces, \"terra sig\" can be polished with a soft cloth or brush to achieve a shine ranging from a smooth silky lustre to a high gloss. The surface of ancient terra sigillata vessels did not require this burnishing or polishing. Burnishing was a technique used on some wares in the Roman period, but terra sigillata was not one of them. The polished surface can only be retained if fired within the low-fire range and will lose its shine if fired higher, but can still display an appealing silky quality.\n\nThe oldest use for the term terra sigillata was for a medicinal clay from the island of Lemnos. The latter was called \"sealed\" because cakes of it were pressed together and stamped with the head of Artemis. Later, it bore the seal of the Ottoman sultan. This soil's particular mineralic content was such that, in the Renaissance, it was seen as a proof against poisoning, as well as a general cure for any bodily impurities, and it was highly prized as a medicine and medicinal component.\n\nIn 1580, a miner named Adreas Berthold traveled around Germany selling Silesian terra sigillata made from a special clay dug from the hills outside the town of Striga, now Strzegom, Poland, and processed into small tablets. He promoted it as a panacea effective against every type of poison and several diseases, including plague. Berthold invited authorities to test it themselves. In two cases, physicians, princes and town leaders conducted trials involving dogs who were either given poison followed by the antidote or poison alone; the dogs who got the antidote lived and the dogs who got the poison alone died. In 1581, a prince tested the antidote on a condemned criminal, who survived.\n\nIn 1588 English ethnographer and translator Thomas Harriot wrote in \"A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\" that Algonquians of the mid–Atlantic region treated various sores and wounds with \"wapeih\", a kind of terra sigillata that English surgeons and physicians found to be of the same kind \"of vertue and more effectuall\" than the contemporary European sort.\n\nIn archaeological usage, the term \"terra sigillata\" without further qualification normally denotes the Arretine ware of Italy, made at Arezzo, and Gaulish samian ware manufactured first in South Gaul, particularly at La Graufesenque, near Millau, and later at Lezoux and adjacent sites near Clermont-Ferrand, and at east Gaulish sites such as Trier, Sinzig and Rheinzabern. These high-quality tablewares were particularly popular and widespread in the Western Roman Empire from about 50 BC to the early 3rd century AD. Definitions of 'TS' have grown up from the earliest days of antiquarian studies, and are far from consistent; one survey of Classical art says: \"Terra sigillata\" ... is a Latin term used by modern scholars to designate a class of decorated red-gloss pottery ... not all red-gloss ware was decorated, and hence the more inclusive term 'Samian ware' is sometimes used to characterize all varieties of it.\n- whereas Anthony King's definition, following the more usual practice among Roman pottery specialists, makes no mention of decoration, but states that terra sigillata is 'alternatively known as samian ware'. However, 'samian ware' is normally used only to refer to the sub-class of terra sigillata made in ancient Gaul. In European languages other than English, terra sigillata, or a translation (e.g. \"terre sigillée\"), is always used for both Italian and Gaulish products. Nomenclature has to be established at an early stage of research into a subject, and antiquarians of the 18th and 19th centuries often used terms that we would not choose today, but as long as their meaning is clear and well-established, this does not matter, and detailed study of the history of the terminology is really a side-issue that is of academic interest only. Scholars writing in English now often use \"red gloss wares\" or \"red slip wares\", both to avoid these issues of definition, and also because many other wares of the Roman period share aspects of technique with the traditional sigillata fabrics.\nItalian and Gaulish TS vessels were made in standardised shapes constituting services of matching dishes, bowls and serving vessels. These changed and evolved over time, and have been very minutely classified; the first major scheme, by the German classical archaeologist Hans Dragendorff (1895), is still in use (as e.g. \"Dr.29\"), and there have been many others, such as the classifications of Déchelette, Knorr, Hermet, Walters, Curle, Loeschcke, Ritterling, Hermet and Ludowici, and more recently, the \"Conspectus\" of Arretine forms and Hayes's type-series of African Red Slip and Eastern sigillatas. These reference sometimes make it possible to date the manufacture of a broken decorated sherd to within 20 years or less.\n\nMost of the forms that were decorated with figures in low relief were thrown in pottery moulds, the inner surfaces of which had been decorated using fired-clay stamps or punches (usually referred to as \"poinçons\") and some free-hand work using a stylus. The mould was therefore decorated on its interior surface with a full decorative design of impressed, intaglio (hollowed) motifs that would appear in low relief on any bowl formed in it. As the bowl dried, the shrinkage was sufficient for it to be withdrawn from the mould, in order to carry out any finishing work, which might include the addition of foot-rings, the shaping and finishing of rims, and in all cases the application of the slip. Barbotine and appliqué ('sprigged') techniques were sometimes used to decorate vessels of closed forms. Study of the characteristic decorative motifs, combined in some cases with name-stamps of workshops incorporated into the decoration, and also sometimes with the cursive signatures of mouldmakers, makes it possible to build up a very detailed knowledge of the industry. Careful observation of form and fabric is therefore usually enough for an archaeologist experienced in the study of sigillata to date and identify a broken sherd: a potter's stamp or moulded decoration provides even more precise evidence. The classic guide by Oswald and Pryce, published in 1920 set out many of the principles, but the literature on the subject goes back into the 19th century, and is now extremely voluminous, including many monographs on specific regions, as well as excavation reports on important sites that have produced significant assemblages of sigillata wares, and articles in learned journals, some of which are dedicated to Roman pottery studies.\nThe motifs and designs on the relief-decorated wares echo the general traditions of Graeco-Roman decorative arts, with depictions of deities, references to myths and legends, and popular themes such as hunting and erotic scenes. Individual figure-types, like the vessel-shapes, have been classified, and in many cases they may be linked with specific potters or workshops. Some of the decoration relates to contemporary architectural ornament, with egg-and-tongue (ovolo) mouldings, acanthus and vine scrolls and the like. While the decoration of Arretine ware is often highly naturalistic in style, and is closely comparable with silver tableware of the same period, the designs on the Gaulish products, made by provincial artisans adopting Classical subjects, are intriguing for their expression of 'romanisation', the fusion of Classical and native cultural and artistic traditions.\n\nMany of the Gaulish manufacturing sites have been extensively excavated and studied. At La Graufesenque in southern Gaul, documentary evidence in the form of lists or tallies apparently fired with single kiln-loads, giving potters' names and numbers of pots have long been known, and they suggest very large loads of 25,000–30,000 vessels. Though not all the kilns at this, or other, manufacturing sites were so large, the excavation of the \"grand four\" (big kiln) at La Graufesenque, which was in use in the late 1st and early 2nd century, confirms the scale of the industry. It is a rectangular stone-built structure measuring 11.3 m. by 6.8 m. externally, with an original height estimated at 7 metres. With up to nine 'storeys' within (dismantled after each firing), formed of tile floors and vertical columns in the form of clay pipes or tubes, which also served to conduct the heat, it has been estimated that it was capable of firing 30,000–40,000 vessels at a time, at a temperature of around 1000 °C.\n\nA 2005 work has shown that the slip is a matrix of mainly silicon and aluminium oxides, within which are suspended sub-microscopic crystals of haematite and corundum. The matrix itself does not contain any metallic ions, the haematite is substituted in aluminium and titanium while the corundum is substituted in iron. The two crystal populations are homogenously dispersed within the matrix. The colour of haematite depends on the crystal size. Large crystals of this mineral are black but as the size decreases to sub-micron the colour shifts to red. The fraction of aluminium has a similar effect. It was formerly thought that the difference between 'red' and 'black' samian was due to the presence (black) or absence (red) of reducing gases from the kiln and that the construction of the kiln was so arranged as to prevent the reducing gases from the fuel from coming into contact with the pottery. The presence of iron oxides in the clay/slip was thought to be reflected in the colour according to the oxidation state of the iron (Fe[III] for the red and Fe[II] for the black, the latter produced by the reducing gases coming into contact with the pottery during firing). It now appears as a result of this recent work that this is not the case and that the colour of the glossy slip is in fact due to no more than the crystal size of the minerals dispersed within the matrix glass.\n\nArretine ware, in spite of its very distinctive appearance, was an integral part of the wider picture of fine ceramic tablewares in the Graeco-Roman world of the Hellenistic and early Roman period. That picture must itself be seen in relation to the luxury tablewares made of silver. Centuries before Italian terra sigillata was made, Attic painted vases, and later their regional variants made in Italy, involved the preparation of a very fine clay body covered with a slip that fired to a glossy surface without the need for any polishing or burnishing. Greek painted wares also involved the precise understanding and control of firing conditions to achieve the contrasts of black and red.\nGlossy-slipped black pottery made in Etruria and Campania continued this technological tradition, though painted decoration gave way to simpler stamped motifs and in some cases, to applied motifs moulded in relief. The tradition of decorating entire vessels in low relief was also well established in Greece and Asia Minor by the time the Arretine industry began to expand in the middle of the 1st century BC, and examples were imported into Italy. Relief-decorated cups, some in lead-glazed wares, were produced at several eastern centres, and undoubtedly played a part in the technical and stylistic evolution of decorated Arretine, but Megarian bowls, made chiefly in Greece and Asia Minor, are usually seen as the most direct inspiration. These are small, hemispherical bowls without foot-rings, and their decoration is frequently very reminiscent of contemporary silver bowls, with formalised, radiating patterns of leaves and flowers. The crisp and precisely profiled forms of the plain dishes and cups were also part of a natural evolution of taste and fashion in the Mediterranean world of the 1st century BC.\n\nArretine ware began to be manufactured at and near Arezzo (Tuscany) a little before the middle of the 1st century BC. The industry expanded rapidly in a period when Roman political and military influence was spreading far beyond Italy: for the inhabitants of the first provinces of the Roman Empire in the reign of the Emperor Augustus (\"reg.\" 27 BC – AD 14), this tableware, with its precise forms, shiny surface, and, on the decorated vessels, its visual introduction to Classical art and mythology, must have deeply impressed some inhabitants of the new northern provinces of the Empire. Certainly it epitomised certain aspects of Roman taste and technical expertise. Pottery industries in the areas we now call north-east France and Belgium quickly began to copy the shapes of plain Arretine dishes and cups in the wares now known as Gallo-Belgic, and in South and Central Gaul, it was not long before local potters also began to emulate the mould-made decoration and the glossy red slip itself.\n\nThe most recognisable decorated Arretine form is Dragendorff 11, a large, deep goblet on a high pedestal base, closely resembling some silver table vessels of the same period, such as the Warren Cup. The iconography, too, tended to match the subjects and styles seen on silver plate, namely mythological and genre scenes, including erotic subjects, and small decorative details of swags, leafy wreaths and ovolo (egg-and-tongue) borders that may be compared with elements of Augustan architectural ornament. The deep form of the Dr.11 allowed the \"poinçons\" (stamps) used making the moulds of human and animal figures to be fairly large, often about 5–6 cm high, and the modelling is frequently very accomplished indeed, attracting the interest of modern art-historians as well as archaeologists. Major workshops, such as those of M.Perennius Tigranus, P. Cornelius and Cn. Ateius, stamped their products, and the names of the factory-owners and of the workers within the factories, which often appear on completed bowls and on plain wares, have been extensively studied, as have the forms of the vessels, and the details of their dating and distribution.\nItalian sigillata was not made only at or near Arezzo itself: some of the important Arezzo businesses had branch factories in Pisa, and by the beginning of the 1st century AD, the Ateius and Rasinius workshops had set up branch factories at La Muette, near Lyon in Central Gaul. Nor were the classic Arretine wares of the Augustan period the only forms of terra sigillata made in Italy: later sigillata industries in the Po Valley and elsewhere continued the tradition. The history of sigillata manufacture in Italy is succinctly summarised in Hayes 1997, pages 41–52.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, examples of the ware that were serendipitously discovered in digging foundations in Arezzo drew admiring attention as early as the 13th century, when Restoro d'Arezzo's massive encyclopedia included a chapter praising the refined Roman ware discovered in his native city, \"what is perhaps the first account of an aspect of ancient art to be written since classical times\". The chronicler Giovanni Villani also mentioned the ware.\n\nThe first published study of Arretine ware was that of Fabroni in 1841, and by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, German scholars in particular had made great advances in systematically studying and understanding both Arretine ware and the Gaulish samian that occurred on Roman military sites being excavated in Germany. Dragendorff's classification was expanded by other scholars, including S. Loeschcke in his study of the Italian sigillata excavated at the early Roman site of Haltern. Research on Arretine ware has continued very actively throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, for example with the publication and revision of Oxé-Comfort and the \"Conspectus\" of forms, bringing earlier work on stamps and shapes up to date. As with all ancient pottery studies, each generation asks new questions and applies new techniques (such as analysis of clays) in the attempt to find the answers.\n\nSigillata vessels, both plain and decorated, were manufactured at several centres in southern France, including Bram, Montans, La Graufesenque, Le Rozier and Banassac, from the late 1st century BC: of these, La Graufesenque, near Millau, was the principal producer and exporter. Although the establishment of sigillata potteries in Gaul may well have arisen initially to meet local demand and to undercut the prices of imported Italian goods, they became enormously successful in their own right, and by the later 1st century AD, South Gaulish samian was being exported not only to other provinces in the north-west of the Empire, but also to Italy and other regions of the Mediterranean, North Africa and even the eastern Empire. One of the finds in the ruins of Pompeii, destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in August AD 79, was a consignment of South Gaulish sigillata, still in its packing crate; like all finds from the Vesuvian sites, this hoard of pottery is invaluable as dating evidence.\n\nSouth Gaulish samian typically has a redder slip and deeper pink fabric than Italian sigillata. The best slips, vivid red and of an almost mirror-like brilliance, were achieved during the Claudian and early Neronian periods (Claudius, \"reg\". AD 41–54; Nero, \"reg\". AD 54–68). At the same period, some workshops experimented briefly with a marbled red-and-yellow slip, a variant that never became generally popular. Early production of plain forms in South Gaul initially followed the Italian models closely, and even the characteristic Arretine decorated form, Dragendorff 11, was made. But many new shapes quickly evolved, and by the second half of the 1st century AD, when Italian sigillata was no longer influential, South Gaulish samian had created its own characteristic repertoire of forms. The two principal decorated forms were Dragendorff 30, a deep, cylindrical bowl, and Dragendorff 29, a carinated ('keeled') shallow bowl with a marked angle, emphasised by a moulding, mid-way down the profile. The footring is low, and potters' stamps are usually bowl-maker's marks placed in the interior base, so that vessels made from the same, or parallel, moulds may bear different names. The rim of the 29, small and upright in early examples of the form, but much deeper and more everted by the 70s of the 1st century, is finished with rouletted decoration, and the relief-decorated surfaces necessarily fall into two narrow zones. These were usually decorated with floral and foliate designs of wreaths and scrolls at first: the Dr.29 resting on its rim illustrated in the lead section of this article is an early example, less angular than the developed form of the 60s and 70s, with decoration consisting of simple, very elegant leaf-scrolls. Small human and animal figures, and more complex designs set out in separate panels, became more popular by the 70s of the 1st century. Larger human and animal figures could be used on the Dr.30 vessels, but while many of these have great charm, South Gaulish craftsmen never achieved, and perhaps never aspired to, the Classical naturalism of some of their Italian counterparts.\n\nIn the last two decades of the 1st century, the Dragendorff 37, a deep, rounded vessel with a plain upright rim, overtook the 29 in popularity. This simple shape remained the standard Gaulish samian relief-decorated form, from all Gaulish manufacturing regions, for more than a century. Small relief-decorated beakers such as forms Déchelette 67 and Knorr 78 were also made in South Gaul, as were occasional 'one-off' or very ambitious mould-made vessels, such as large thin-walled flagons and flasks. But the mass of South Gaulish samian found on Roman sites of the 1st century AD consists of plain dishes, bowls and cups, especially Dr.18 (a shallow dish) and Dr.27 (a little cup with a distinctive double curve to the profile), many of which bear potters' name-stamps, and the large decorated forms 29, 30 and 37.\n\nA local industry inspired by Arretine and South Gaulish imports grew up in the Iberian provinces in the 1st century AD. \"Terra sigillata hispanica\" developed its own distinctive forms and designs, and continued in production into the late Roman period, the 4th and 5th centuries AD. It was not exported to other regions.\n\nThe principal Central Gaulish samian potteries were situated at Lezoux and Les Martres-de-Veyre, not far from Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne. Production had already begun at Lezoux in the Augustan period (Augustus, \"reg\". 27 BC–AD 14), but it was not until the reign of Trajan (AD 98–117), and the beginning of a decline in the South Gaulish export trade, that Central Gaulish samian ware became important outside its own region. Though it never achieved the extensive geographical distribution of the South Gaulish factories, in the provinces of Gaul and Britain, it was by far the most common type of fine tableware, plain and decorated, in use during the 2nd century AD. The quality of the ware and the slip is usually excellent, and some of the products of Les Martres-de-Veyre, in particular, are outstanding, with a lustrous slip and a very hard, dense body. The surface colour tends towards a more orange-red hue than the typical South Gaulish slips.\n\nVessel-forms that had been made in South Gaul continued to be produced, though as the decades passed, they evolved and changed with the normal shifts of fashion, and some new shapes were created, such as the plain bowl with a horizontal flange below the rim, Dr.38. Mortaria, food-preparation bowls with a gritted interior surface, were also made in Central Gaulish samian fabric in the second half of the 2nd century (Dr.45). There is a small sub-class of Central Gaulish samian ware with a glossy black slip, though the dividing line between black terra sigillata and other fine black-gloss wares, which were also manufactured in the area, is sometimes hazy. When a vessel is a classic samian form and decorated in relief in the style of a known samian potter, but finished with black slip rather than a red one, it may be classed as black samian.\nThough the Central Gaulish forms continued and built upon the South Gaulish traditions, the decoration of the principal decorated forms, Dr.30 and Dr.37, was distinctive. New human and animal figure-types appeared, generally modelled with greater realism and sophistication than those of La Graufesenque and other South Gaulish centres. Figure-types and decorative details have been classified, and can often be linked to specific workshops Lezoux wares also included vases decorated with barbotine relief, with appliqué motifs, and a class usually referred to as 'cut-glass' decoration, with geometric patterns cut into the surface of the vessel before slipping and firing. Two standard 'plain' types made in considerable numbers in Central Gaul also included barbotine decoration, Dr.35 and 36, a matching cup and dish with a curved horizontal rim embellished with a stylised scroll of leaves in relief.\n\nDuring the second half of the 2nd century, some Lezoux workshops making relief-decorated bowls, above all that of Cinnamus, dominated the market with their large production. The wares of Cinnamus, Paternus, Divixtus, Doeccus, Advocisus, Albucius and some others often included large, easily legible name-stamps incorporated into the decoration, clearly acting as brand-names or advertisements. Though these vessels were very competently made, they are heavy and somewhat coarse in form and finish compared with earlier Gaulish samian ware.\n\nFrom the end of the 2nd century, the export of sigillata from Central Gaul rapidly, perhaps even abruptly, ceased. Pottery production continued, but in the 3rd century, it reverted to being a local industry.\n\nThere were numerous potteries manufacturing terra sigillata in East Gaul, which included Alsace, the Saarland, and the Rhine and Mosel regions, but while the samian pottery from Luxeuil, La Madeleine, Chémery-Faulquemont, Lavoye, Remagen, Sinzig, Blickweiler and other sites is of interest and importance mainly to specialists, two sources stand out because their wares are often found outside their own immediate areas, namely Rheinzabern, near Speyer, and Trier.\n\nThe Trier potteries evidently began to make samian vessels around the beginning of the 2nd century AD, and were still active until the middle of the 3rd century. The styles and the potters have been divided by scholars into two main phases, Werkstatten I and II. Some of the later mould-made Dr.37 bowls are of very poor quality, with crude decoration and careless finishing.\n\nThe Rheinzabern kilns and their products have been studied since Wilhelm Ludowici (1855–1929) began to excavate there in 1901, and to publish his results in a series of detailed reports. Rheinzabern produced both decorated and plain forms for around a century from the middle of the 2nd century. Some of the Dr.37 bowls, for example those with the workshop stamp of Ianus, bear comparison with Central Gaulish products of the same date: others are less successful. But the real strength of the Rheinzabern industry lay in its extensive production of good-quality samian cups, beakers, flagons and vases, many imaginatively decorated with barbotine designs or in the 'cut-glass' incised technique. Ludowici created his own type-series, which sometimes overlaps with those of other sigillata specialists. Ludowici's types use combinations of upper- and lower-case letters rather than simple numbers, the first letter referring to the general shape, such as 'T' for \"Teller\" (dish).\n\nIn general, the products of the East Gaulish industries moved away from the early imperial Mediterranean tradition of intricately profiled dishes and cups, and ornamented bowls made in moulds, and converged with the later Roman local traditions of pottery-making in the northern provinces, using free-thrown, rounded forms and creating relief designs with freehand slip-trailing. Fashions in fine tablewares were changing. Some East Gaulish producers made bowls and cups decorated only with rouletted or stamped decoration, and in the 3rd and 4th centuries, Argonne ware, decorated with all-over patterns of small stamps, was made in the area east of Rheims and quite widely traded. Argonne ware was essentially still a type of sigillata, and the most characteristic form is a small, sturdy Dr.37 bowl. Small, localised attempts to make conventional relief-decorated samian ware included a brief and unsuccessful venture at Colchester in Britain, apparently initiated by potters from the East Gaulish factories at Sinzig, a centre that was itself an offshoot of the Trier workshops.\n\nIn the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, there had been several industries making fine red tablewares with smooth, glossy-slipped surfaces since about the middle of the 2nd century BC, well before the rise of the Italian sigillata workshops. By the 1st century BC, their forms often paralleled Arretine plain-ware shapes quite closely. There were evidently centres of production in Syria; in western Turkey, exported through Ephesos; Pergamon; Çandarlı, near Pergamon; and on Cyprus, but archaeologists often refer to eastern sigillata A from Northern Syria, eastern sigillata B from Tralles in Asia Minor, eastern sigillata C from ancient Pitane, and eastern sigillata D (or Cypriot sigillata) from Cyprus, as there is still much to be learnt about this material. While eastern sigillata C is known to come from Çandarli (ancient Pitane), there were likely other workshops in the wider region of Pergamon. By the early 2nd century AD, when Gaulish samian was completely dominating the markets in the Northern provinces, the eastern sigillatas were themselves beginning to be displaced by the rising importance of African Red Slip wares in the Mediterranean and the Eastern Empire. In the fourth century AD, Phocaean red slip appears as a successor to Eastern sigillata C.\n\nIn the 1980s two primary groups of Eastern Terra Sigillata in the Eastern Mediterranean basin were distinguished as ETS-I and ETS-II based on their chemical fingerprints as shown by analysis by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). ETS-I originated in Eastern Cyprus, whereas the ETS-II was probably made in Pamphylia, at Perge, Aspendos and Side. However this classification has been criticized, and is not universally accepted. A potter's quarter at Sagalassos inland from the southern Turkish coast has been excavated since it was discovered in 1987, and its wares traced to many sites in the region. It was active from around 25 to 550 AD.\n\nAfrican red slip ware (ARS) was the final development of terra sigillata. While the products of the Italian and Gaulish red-gloss industries flourished and were exported from their places of manufacture for at most a century or two each, ARS production continued for more than 500 years. The centres of production were in the Roman provinces of Africa Proconsularis, Byzacena and Numidia; that is, modern Tunisia and part of eastern Algeria. From about the 4th century AD, competent copies of the fabric and forms were also made in several other regions, including Asia Minor, the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt. Over the long period of production, there was obviously much change and evolution in both forms and fabrics. Both Italian and Gaulish plain forms influenced ARS in the 1st and 2nd centuries (for example, Hayes Form 2, the cup or dish with an outcurved rim decorated with barbotine leaves, is a direct copy of the samian forms Dr.35 and 36, made in South and Central Gaul), but over time a distinctive ARS repertoire developed.\n\nThere was a wide range of dishes and bowls, many with rouletted or stamped decoration, and closed forms such as tall ovoid flagons with appliqué ornament (Hayes Form 171). The ambitious large rectangular dishes with relief decoration in the centre and on the wide rims (Hayes Form 56), were clearly inspired by decorated silver platters of the 4th century, which were made in rectangular and polygonal shapes as well as in the traditional circular form. Decorative motifs reflected not only the Graeco-Roman traditions of the Mediterranean, but eventually the rise of Christianity as well. There is a great variety of monogram crosses and plain crosses amongst the stamps.\n\nIn contrast to the archaeological usage, in which the term \"terra sigillata\" refers to a whole class of pottery, in contemporary ceramic art, 'terra sigillata' describes only a watery refined slip used to facilitate the burnishing of raw clay surfaces to promote glossy surface effects in low fire techniques, including primitive and unglazed alternative western-style Raku firing. Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature glazed ceramic techniques.\n\nIn 1906 the German potter Karl Fischer re-invented the method of making terra sigillata of Roman quality and obtained patent protection for this procedure at the \"Kaiserliche Patentamt\" in Berlin.\n\nModern terra sigillata is made by allowing the clay particles to separate into layers by particle size. A deflocculant such as sodium silicate is often added to the watery clay/water slip mixture to facilitate separation of fine particle flocs or aggregates. For undisturbed deflocculated slip settling in a transparent container, these layers are usually visible within 24 hours. Siphoning off the topmost layers of slip, which contain the smallest clay particles, produces terra sigillata. The remaining larger clay-particle layers are discarded.\n\nTerra sigillata is usually brushed or sprayed in thin layers onto dry or almost dry unfired ware. The ware is then burnished with a soft cloth before the water in the terra sigillata soaks into the porous body or with a hard, smooth-surfaced object . The burnished ware is fired, often to a lower temperature than normal bisque temperature of approximately 900 °C. Higher firing temperatures tend to remove the burnished effect because the clay particles start to recrystalize.\n\nSince the 18th century Samian ware pots have been found in sufficient numbers in the sea near Whitstable and Herne Bay that local people used them for cooking.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4100081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4100081", "title": "Think globally, act locally", "text": "Think globally, act locally\n\nThe phrase \"Think globally, act locally\" or \"Think global, act local\" has been used in various contexts, including planning, environment, education, mathematics, and business.\n\n\"Think globally, act locally\" urges people to consider the health of the entire planet and to take action in their own communities and cities. Long before governments began enforcing environmental laws, individuals were coming together to protect habitats and the organisms that live within them. These efforts are referred to as grassroots efforts. They occur on a local level and are primarily run by volunteers and helpers.\n\n\"Think Globally, Act Locally\" originally began at the grassroots level, however, it is now a global concept with high importance. It is not just volunteers who take the environment into consideration. It is corporations, government officials, education system, and local communities.\n\nWarren Heaps states, \"It's really important to recognize that markets are different around the world, and company compensation programs should reflect a balance between global corporate philosophy and local practice and culture\".\n\nThe original phrase \"Think global, act local\" has been attributed to Scots town planner and social activist Patrick Geddes.\nAlthough the exact phrase does not appear in Geddes' 1915 book \"Cities in Evolution,\" the idea (as applied to city planning) is clearly evident: \" 'Local character' is thus no mere accidental old-world quaintness, as its mimics think and say. It is attained only in course of adequate grasp and treatment of the whole environment, and in active sympathy with the essential and characteristic life of the place concerned.\"— Patrick Geddes, was a Scottish biologist, sociologist, philanthropist and pioneering town planner. He was also responsible for introducing the concept of \"region\" to architecture and planning. He has made significant contributions to the consideration of the environment. Geddes believed in working with the environment, versus working against it.\n\nTown planning is important to understanding of the idea \"think globally, act locally\". Urban management and development highly impacts the surrounding environment. The ways in which this is initiated is vital to the health of the environment. Corporations need to be aware of global communities when expanding their companies to new locations.Not only do corporations need to be aware of global differences, but also Urban and rural areas who plan on expanding or changing the dynamics of their community. As stated \"Addressing the complex urban environmental problems, in order to improve urban livability through Urban Environmental Strategies (UES), involves taking stock of the existing urban environmental problems, their comparative analysis and prioritization, setting out objectives and targets, and identification of various measures to meet these objectives\".\n\nThe first use of the phrase in an environmental context is disputed. Some say it was coined by David Brower, founder of Friends of the Earth, as a slogan for FOE when it was founded in 1969, although others attribute it to René Dubos in 1977. Canadian \"futurist\" Frank Feather also chaired a conference called \"Thinking Globally, Acting Locally\" in 1979 and has claimed the paternity of the expression. Other possible originators include French theologian Jacques Ellul.\n\nThe term was increasingly applied to initiatives in international education and was advanced by Stuart Grauer in his 1989 University of San Diego publication, Think Globally, Act Locally: A Delphi Study of Educational Leadership Through the Development of International Resources in the Local Community. In this publication it was attributed to Harlan Cleveland.\nIt is said that this term was used by German-American sociologist Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy in the 1950s or earlier, prior to the formation of the United Nations Organization.\n\nIt is not only corporations that are acknowledging the importance of environmental issues, but also the education system. Government officials and school boards across the world are beginning to develop a new way of teaching. Globalization is now thought of as an important concept to understanding the world. Certain schools believe it is important to discuss global issues as young as 5 years old. It is students who are our future, therefore understanding the concept of \"think globally, act locally\" is fundamental to our future.\n\nThe term is also used in business strategy, where multinational corporations are encouraged to build local roots.\nThis is sometimes expressed by converging the words \"global\" and \"local\" into the single word \"glocal,\" a term used by several companies (notably Sony Corporation and other major Japanese multinationals) in their advertising and branding strategies in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nCurrently more and more corporations are finding it extremely important to analyze the environmental damage of their company. The pressure they receive from government officials and local communities regarding environmental issues is vital to their company's image. Glocalization is an emerging concept throughout the business world. It was first developed by the Japanese, however, it has now emerged throughout Western society. Glocalization refers to the practice of conducting business according to both local and global considerations \n\nThe phrase is an in-joke among mathematicians, as it is often used in situations where the global structure of an object (e.g., a manifold, a Diophantine equation, or a group) can be inferred from the local structure. (See Hasse principle for a detailed description of one such example.)\n\n\n"}
