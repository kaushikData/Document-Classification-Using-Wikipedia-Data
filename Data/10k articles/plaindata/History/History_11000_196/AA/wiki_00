The apology was delivered by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.\n\nFor more than a decade since the \"Bringing Them Home\" report was submitted to Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, he and his coalition colleagues consistently rejected calls for a formal government apology, though some coalition government members stated that they were personally sorry for the outcomes of the policy. They were concerned that a formal apology could be construed as an admission of deliberate wrongdoing, rather than acknowledging that the originally stated intentions of the government were believed to be in the interests of the children and their futures. Howard and his supporters were concerned that such an apology would suggest that the government would be admitting liability in any duty-of-care legal proceedings.\n\nAfter the 2007 federal election the newly installed Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced on 11 December 2007 that the government would make an apology to Indigenous Australians, the wording of which would be decided in consultation with Aboriginal leaders.\n\nThe Liberal Party opposition was split on the issue. Its leader Brendan Nelson initially said that an apology would risk encouraging a \"culture of guilt\" in Australia. However, support for an apology was expressed by other senior Liberals, such as Malcolm Turnbull, Peter Costello, Bill Heffernan, and former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Former Liberal minister Judi Moylan said: \"I think as a nation we owe an apology. We shouldn't be thinking about it as an individual apology — it's an apology that is coming from the nation state because it was governments that did these things.\" Nelson later said that he supported the government apology. Following a party meeting, the Liberal Party as a whole expressed its support for an apology, and it achieved bipartisan consensus. Nelson stated: \"I, on behalf of the Coalition, of the alternative government of Australia, are providing in-principle support for the offer of an apology to the forcibly removed generations of Aboriginal children.\"\n\nLyn Austin, chairwoman of Stolen Generations Victoria, expressed why she believed an apology was necessary, recounting her experiences as a stolen child:\nI thought I was being taken just for a few days. I can recall seeing my mother standing on the side of the road with her head in her hands, crying, and me in the black FJ Holden wondering why she was so upset. A few hundred words can't fix this all but it's an important start and it's a beginning[...]\nI see myself as that little girl, crying myself to sleep at night, crying and wishing I could go home to my family. Everything's gone, the loss of your culture, the loss of your family, all these things have a big impact.\nAt 9:30am on 13 February 2008, Rudd presented the apology to Indigenous Australians as a motion to be voted on by the house. The form of the apology was as follows:\n\nThe text of the apology did not refer to compensation to Aboriginal people as a whole, nor to members of the Stolen Generations specifically. Rudd followed the apology with a 20-minute speech to the house about the need for this action. The government's apology and his speech were widely applauded among both Indigenous Australians and the non-indigenous general public.\n\nBrendan Nelson also delivered a 20-minute speech. He endorsed the apology but in his speech Nelson referred to the \"under-policing\" of child welfare in Aboriginal communities, as well as a host of social ills blighting the lives of Aboriginal people.\n\nThe Alice Springs Crown Prosecutor Nanette Rogers with great courage revealed to the nation in 2006 the case of a four-year-old girl drowned while being raped by a teenager who had been sniffing petrol. She told us of the two children – one a baby – sexually assaulted by two men while their mothers were off drinking alcohol. Another baby was stabbed by a man trying to kill her mother.\n\nNelson's speech was considered controversial and received mixed reactions. Thousands of people who had gathered in public spaces in Canberra and Melbourne to hear the apology turned their backs on the screens that broadcast Nelson speaking. In Perth, people booed and jeered until the screen was switched off. In Parliament House's Great Hall, elements of the audience began a slow clap, with some finally turning their backs. There were similar reactions and walk-outs in Sydney and elsewhere.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the House of Representatives unanimously adopted the proposed apology motion. Six members of Nelson's opposition caucus — Don Randall, Sophie Mirabella, Dennis Jensen, Wilson Tuckey, Luke Simpkins, and Alby Schultz — left the House in protest at the apology. Peter Dutton was the only Opposition front bencher to abstain from the apology.\n\nTom Calma, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, gave a speech formally responding to the government's apology.\n\nLater that day, the Senate considered a motion for an identical apology. The Leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown, attempted to amend the motion to have it include words committing parliament to offering compensation to those who suffered loss under past indigenous policies, but was opposed by all the other parties. The original motion was passed unanimously.\n\n"}

He is the founder and current director of the Foreign Affairs Oral History Program at the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. Since 1985 he has conducted over a thousand oral histories of retired American diplomats.\n\nBorn in Chicago in 1928, Kennedy moved with his mother and two elder brothers to the Pasadena area of California in the early 1930s, where he attended a series of public elementary schools. Later his mother took him to Annapolis where a brother attended the Naval Academy. Living in Annapolis he developed a strong interest in history, particularly American. He went to Kent School in Connecticut, graduating in 1946 then on to Williams College where he obtained an honors degree in history. Upon graduating in 1950, Kennedy joined the United States Air Force as an enlisted man in the intelligence branch. After a year's study of Russian at the Army Language School in Monterrey, California, he served in Korea during the Korean War and Germany. At the end of his four-year enlistment he studied at Boston University and received a MA in history. Having taken and passed the Foreign Service written examination in 1954 he took the oral examination after leaving the Air Force and passed that hurdle and entered the Foreign Service in 1955.\n\nIn his 30 years in the Foreign Service Kennedy was a consular officer dealing with the protection of American citizens abroad, the issuance of visas to foreigners and assistance to the growing throng of Americans visiting overseas in Frankfurt, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, then in the war zone of South Vietnam as consul general, then in more peaceful Athens, Greece, Seoul, South Korea and finally Naples, Italy as consul general.\n\nKennedy retired from the Foreign Service in 1985 and wrote a well-received history of the United States Consular Service which was published in 1990 by the Greenwood Press. A revised edition was published in 2015 and covered the years up to 1924. Realizing that the work of American diplomats was barely acknowledged, except for a few great names, such as Benjamin Franklin, in the teaching of American history, he started an oral history program, first at George Washington University in 1985 and then at Georgetown University. These efforts were barely funded and the oral history did not have much support until the creation of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training in 1986 by a group of retired Foreign Service officers. Since that time Stu Kennedy has been director of the Foreign Affairs Oral History Program of the Association. He has conducted some 1,000 oral histories of retired American diplomats whose careers range from the 1920s to the present. These are inclusive interviews running about 10 hours, especially those done in later periods, and cover early childhood, education, experiences outside the diplomatic period as well as service to the State Department. Both career and non-career officers are covered. The texts of the interviews are available on the Library of Congress's website, Frontline Diplomacy, and on the website of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training.\n\nKennedy was awarded the Foreign Service Cup from the Director General of the Foreign Service in 1997 for his work as an oral historian and in 2014 received the Award for Lifetime Contribution to American Diplomacy from the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA). As of 2017 he is still conducting interviews.\n\n\n"}

The \"Chronicon\" was written in the form of a rotulus (or scroll) rather than a codex. The original, and sole extant copy, of the scroll is preserved in Turin (Archivio di Stato, Nuova collezione, \"museo\"). The scroll consists of twenty-eight pieces of parchment sewn together, of which fragments are now missing. The work is divided into five sections, plus an appendix; of which sections four and five are incomplete.\n\nThe \"Chronicon\" relates the story of monastery of Novalesa from its foundation, by the patrician Abbo in 726, up to the mid-eleventh century. Its main purpose was to emphasise the connection between the revived eleventh-century community at Novalesa and the earlier community of monks, who had been forced to abandon the monastery in 906 by incursions into the western Alps by Saracens (Muslims from Al-Andalus). When the monks finally returned to Novalesa, in the early eleventh century, they found that their monastery had lost its formerly important status in the region. The anonymous author of the \"Chronicon\" blamed Arduin Glaber of Turin for this. The \"Chronicon\" accuses Arduin Glaber of taking advantage of the monks’ absence to usurp their lands in the valley of Susa. \n\nThe text draws on both oral sources and written ones. In addition to charters (legal documents, recording grants of rights and/or authority), the anonymous author made use of narrative sources including Paul the Deacon's \"Historia Langobardorum\", the \"Liber Pontificalis\", and the Latin heroic epic Waltharius.\n\n\n"}

This political administration included all the towns and elizates that existed within its territory. The elizates were all governed by the Foral law, while the towns had their own law. The county of Durango was a vassal state of the Kingdom of Pamplona (later, Navarre), and in the 13th Century it became a constituent part of the Lordship of Biscay. It has been part of the territory of Biscay since then. Its capital city was the town of Durango.\n\nThe first known reference of the existence of a political organization in the territory of Durango was in the year 1050, when Eneco Lupiz is appointed regent of \"the territories of Biscay and Durango\". It appears again in the record of a committee that took place in the church of San Agustin-Etxebarria in the year 1053, this time with the name \"Duranko\". The County of Durango is also mentioned along the County of Álava in relation to its close relationship with the Kingdom of Navarre. During the 11th century the lands of Durango, along with the Lordship of Biscay, moved back and forward between the kingdoms of Castile and Navarre, that kept losing and reconquering the land. In the year 1200, Alfonso VIII of Castile invades the county of Alava and lays siege to the city of Vitoria. Alava and Durango are then ultimately conquered by Castile. In the year 1212, Castilian king Alfonso VIII merges the County of Durango into the Lordship of Biscay, which is awarded to Diego López II de Haro for his war efforts in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. However, Durango maintained its economical and political autonomy, despite being now part of the Lordship.\n\nThe County of Durango was formed by twelve elizates and four towns or cities that occupy the same territory that today does Durangaldea, a region of the province of Biscay and successor of this county. The elizates were Abadiño, Berriz, Mallabia, Mañaria, Iurreta, Garai, Zaldibar, Arrazola, Axpe, Apatamonasterio, Izurtza and San Agustin-Etxebarria, while the four towns were Durango (also the capital), Elorrio, Ermua and Otxandio.\n\nIn 1630 Elorrio annexed the elizate of San Augstin-Etxebarria, and in present time the elizates of Axpe, Arrazola and Apatamonasterio are joined together forming the municipality of Atxondo.\n\nThe ordinary meetings between the representatives of the elizates and towns took place in the called the Audience House. The first documented Audience House was located in the neighborhood of Kurutzesaga in Durango, which was known as \"the Old Audience\" and it is known that there were issues about its ownership between the County and the administration of the town of Durango. \n\nIn 1578, long after the incorporation of the county into the Lordship of Biscay, the House of Astola is acquired and the meetings start taking place there. This house dates the year 1570 and takes place of a previous one, destroyed in a fire. In the House of Astola lived some of the authorities of the County and was also the location of the county's prison. \n\nThe extraordinary meetings between the representatives of the County were held in a field between the hermitages of San Salvador and San Clemente in the neighborhood of Gerediaga, Abadiño, under an oak and seated on stones positioned on a semicircle. The building still stands on its original location and has been recently reformed by the Government of Biscay. The oak was lost around the 18th century. \n\n"}

For instance, with the head of a bear, whether couped or erased, in English heraldry the separation is done horizontally under the neck, which is not lost, whereas in Scottish heraldry the usual practice is for the head to be separated from the body vertically, without keeping the neck attached to it.\n\n"}

In 1970, she became one of the founders of the peronist revolutionary movement Montoneros along with Fernando Abal Medina, who developed a romantic relationship with her. She played a key role in the kidnapping and killing of General Pedro Eugenio Aramburu.\n\nArrostito was born in Buenos Aires, the daughter of a middle-class couple, and grew up in a leftist background, ideologically opposed to Peronism. She graduated as an elementary school teacher and married a communist militant, Rubén Ricardo Roitvan. She later became a hard-line militant under the influence of a left-wing Peronist leader of Irish ancestry, John William Cooke. Arrostito was the only founder of Montoneros with neither Catholic nor Nationalist affiliation.\n\nNorma Arrostito left the communist party in 1967, and joined the organization \"Comando Camilo Torres\", where she met Mario Eduardo Firmenich, Carlos Ramus and Fernando Abal Medina. She fell in love with the latter, despite being seven years older than he was, and broke her relationship with Roitvan. They were trained in guerrilla warfare in Cuba during 1968, and back in Argentina they split from the \"Comando Camilo Torres\" to create a new cell. They were joined by Nélida Arrostito, a sister of Norma and her husband, Carlos Alberto Maguid. Her \"nom de guerre\" was \"Gaby\" (shortened form of the name \"Gabriela\") or \"Gaviota\" (seagull). The organization carried out in a series of operations against the security forces, which ended on 1 June 1970 in the kidnapping and murder of General Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, a former \"de facto\" President and one of the leaders of the Revolución Libertadora which overthrew Perón in 1955. Norma played a supporting role during the kidnapping and she wrote and sent \"dispatches\" to the media updating the process of \"trial\" and \"execution\" of Aramburu. This operation, code named \"Pindapoy\", marked the first public action of Montoneros. Argentina was then under military rule, but the return of Peron to power was a matter of time. The death of Aramburu prompted the fall of president Juan Carlos Onganía and triggered a huge manhunt of suspected terrorists. On 20 September, a police raid caught Ramus and Abal Medina in a restaurant in William Morris, a neighborhood in the western outskirts of Buenos Aires, killing both of them after a brief shootout. After Abal Medina's death, Arrostito was known inside the organisation as \"la viuda\" (\"the widow\").\n\nAfter the military departed from power, Arrostito and her camarades of Montoneros were granted an amnesty by a decree of Héctor José Cámpora, who had won the presidential elections of March 1973. She became staff supervisor of Oscar Bidegain, Governor of Buenos Aires Province and sympathizer of Montoneros ideology. On 3 September 1973, the magazine \"La Causa Peronista\" published an interview with Arrostito and Firmenich where they described in detail the kidnapping and assassination of Aramburu.\n\nDuring Perón's last term (1973–1974), the relationship between the right wing of the party and leftist organisations, including Montoneros strained to the point of no return. In his May Day speech, Perón took sides and denounced Montoneros as \"imberbes\" (\"beardless brats\") and mercenaries to the service of foreign interests. The organisation was proscribed after Perón's death in July, and by September Norma and his companions were forced to live in hideouts and to meet in secret. Meanwhile, the guerrilla operations against security forces reached its climax in 1975. On 24 March 1976, a military coup overthrew president Isabel Perón. The armed forces stepped up the repression not only of leftist guerrillas, but also of their affiliates and even relatives. Arrostito was reported shot and killed after a fierce firefight with an army patrol on 2 December 1976. The truth was that Norma was captured alive and illegally imprisoned at the Navy's school of mechanical engineering, the ESMA (\"Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada\"). The military faked her death in order to keep Montoneros in the belief that a lot of compromising information had been lost with her. Arrostito, however, endured more than a year of torture and humiliation without betraying her camarades. She was eventually killed by a lethal injection of pentothal on 15 January 1978. Her body was never found.\n\n\n"}

Its discussion also includes the way objects are made and their purely visual aspects. In painting, formalism emphasizes compositional elements such as color, line, shape, texture, and other perceptual aspects rather than the historical and social context. At its extreme, formalism in art history posits that everything necessary to comprehending a work of art is contained within the work of art. The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, that is, its conceptual aspect is considered to be of secondary importance.\n\nThe historical origin of the modern form of the question of aesthetic formalism is usually dated to Immanuel Kant and the writing of his third Critique where Kant states: \"Every form of the objects of sense is either \"figure\" (\"Gestalt\") or \"play\" (\"Spiel\"). In the latter case it is either play of figures or the mere play of sensations. The charm (\"Reiz\") of colors... may be added, but the delineations (\"Zeichnung\") in the... composition (\"Komposition\")... constitute the proper object of the pure judgment of taste.\" The philosopher Donald Crawford has summarized Kant's position stating: \"Thus, for Kant, form consists of the spatial... organization of elements: figure, shape, or delineation... In the parts of the \"Critique of Judgment\" in which form is emphasized as the essential aspect of beauty, Kant is consistently a pure formalist.\"\n\nThe philosopher Nick Zangwill of Glasgow University has defined formalism in art as referring to those properties \"that are determined solely by sensory or physical properties—so long as the physical properties in question are not relations to other things and other times.\" The philosopher and architect Branko Mitrovic has defined formalism in art and architecture as \"the doctrine that states that the aesthetic qualities of works of visual art derive from the visual and spatial properties.\"\n\nAccording to the observation that works of art can in general contain formal properties and nonformal properties, the philosopher Nick Zangwill has delineated three types of formalism as they are encountered at the turn of the 21st century. First, Zangwill identifies \"extreme formalists\" who think \"that all works of art are purely formal works—where a work is purely formal if all its aesthetic properties are formal aesthetic properties,\" then he defines \"anti-formalist\" thinkers as those who \"think that no works of art have formal aesthetic properties.\" The third type which Zangwill identifies as representing the transition of the philosophy of aesthetics into the 21st century is that of \"moderate formalism\", where its principal exponents defend the principle \"that all the aesthetic properties of works of art in a select class are formal, and second, that although many works of art outside that class have nonformal aesthetic properties, many of those works also have important formal aesthetic properties that must not be ignored.\"\n\nThe philosopher Michalle Gal has offered a moderate version of formalism, entitled \"Deep Formalism\", which is a symbolic formalism based on philosophical aestheticism. The artwork is defined by her as deep form: \"a form steeped in content that cannot be extracted from it. Artistic content, since it has no existence or sense apart from the form, cannot actually be referred to, other than speculatively. The content seals the form in an opaque, non-reflective, productive symbol.\" Here she introduces a broad concept of symbol, an opaque-productive symbol: one that is not transparent to preconceived or pre-determined referents and meanings, but rather produces new ones.\n\nA formal analysis is an academic method in art history and criticism for analyzing works of art: \"In order to perceive style, and understand it, art historians use 'formal analysis'. This means they describe things very carefully. These descriptions, which may include subjective vocabulary, are always accompanied by illustrations, so that there can be no doubt about what exists objectively\".\n\n\n"}

As executive director and publisher he supported \"Kore\", a Freiburg publisher of feminist books and women's literature. He first published his theories in the late 1980s. In 1999 he presented his theory in the book \"Was Jesus Caesar?\" Since then he has continued his research and written several articles. He has participated in documentary films on Caesar and Christ, given academic lectures, and reconstructed Caesar's funeral ceremony in Spain, based on the historical sources. Carotta lives in Kirchzarten near Freiburg.\n\nFrancesco Carotta's theory runs contrary to all established theories on the historical Jesus. Carotta postulates that the historical person behind the Biblical figure Jesus Christ was not Jesus of Nazareth, but the Roman statesman Gaius Julius Caesar, from whose cult Christianity developed over the course of several generations.\n\nThe thesis of Carotta's book \"Jesus was Caesar\" is based on a comparison of the gospels, especially the earliest Gospel of Mark, with the ancient sources about the last years in the life of Caesar and his immediate legacy. Roman sources include Appian, Plutarch and Suetonius, who all relied to some extent on Caesar's contemporary Gaius Asinius Pollio and his lost \"Historiae\", which according to Carotta might constitute the \"Latin Ur-Gospel\". This is augmented by comparisons from archaeology, numismatics, iconography, liturgy, and ritual traditions. Carotta argues that the multiple parallels he sees between the lives and cults of Caesar and Jesus can best be explained by his theory that Jesus Christ is based on the deified Julius Caesar, transformed and mirrored in the eastern Hellenistic and judaizing regions of the Roman Empire.\n\nWithin Carotta's theory the gospels are \"hypertexts\" after a \"diegetic transposition\" of Latin and Greek Roman sources (\"hypotexts\") on Caesar's life from the beginning of the Civil War, the crossing of the Rubicon, until his assassination, funeral and deification, conforming to Jesus' mission from the Jordan to his arrest, crucifixion and resurrection. Textually transformed from Rome to Jerusalem in Caesar's eastern veteran colonies, the Gospel narrative with its altered geography, dramatic structure, its characters and newly adopted cultural environment, would therefore have been written neither as a mimetic approximation of Caesarian attributes nor as a mythological amalgam, but as a directly dependent, albeit mutated rewriting (\"réécriture\") of actual history.\n\nHe argues that, following this initial transposition, there was at first a redaction of the Caesarian Ur-Gospel inspired by Augustan history and theogony, whereby the later synoptic gospels by Matthew and Luke incorporated (among other pericopes) the Nativity of Jesus, originally transposed from the nativity of Augustus, and the resurrection narrative, according to the chronological-biographical structures in the historical account by Nicolaus of Damascus. Later generations produced more discrete traditions like the Gospel of John, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Book of Revelation. According to Carotta, the ultimate early Christian metamorphosis of the eastern Caesar-religion, which was to reinterpret the foundational cult of the Julian imperial dynasty with regard to the contested Palestine, was provoked by the new Flavian theopolitical ideology, which also induced the rewriting of the vita of Vespasian's court historian Flavius Josephus into the hagiography of Saint Paul in the second part of Acts.\n\nCarotta's book and its translations have drawn little serious academic attention. Except for few feuilleton write-ups the first German edition of Carotta's book was not reviewed.\n\nOutside of Germany his theory drew little response, while the 2003 Dutch translation caused a controversial and at times heated debate in the Dutch media: historian Thomas von der Dunk, philosopher Andreas Kinneging and philosopher Paul Cliteur were among those who supported Carotta's theory, while philosopher Willem J. Ouweneel, theologian Matthijs de Jong, historians Marc van Uytfanghe and Anton van Hooff, and the \"Dutch Bible Society\" dismissed the book. The discussion was revived briefly when a feature documentary about Carotta's research was released in 2007. In an issue of the Dutch magazine \"Quest Historie\" dealing with conspiracy theories, theologian Annette Merz, while acknowledging the similarities between the lives of Jesus and Julius Caesar, was quoted as arguing that Carotta would have to refute the non-Christian sources for the existence of Jesus.\n\nDominican priest Jerome Murphy-O'Connor criticized Carotta for avoiding explanations on why the \"figure called Jesus Christ\" would have been \"invented\" and given a \"life modeled on that of Julius Caesar\", and \"why there should be four versions of the career of Jesus\". Latinist Maria Wyke called Carotta's views \"eccentric\" and described the connections between Caesar and Jesus listed by him as \"sweeping and often superficial parallels, however detailed and justified at book length\". Spanish philologist Antonio Piñero called Carotta's reading of the Gospel as a diegetic transposition an \"ingenious exercise\" but also noted several methodological shortcomings which made the theory \"completely implausible\".\n\nDuring a 2008 lecture and in a subsequent article Carotta presented an extension of his theory, which interprets the Gospel as a diegetic transposition (\"see above\"). In 2009 Carotta wrote an article in which he supported the arguments for the authenticity of the so-called \"Orpheos Bakkikos\", a supposedly syncretistic early Christian amulet showing the Crucifixion of Christ. Carotta postulates that the lost amulet showed the funerary wax effigy of Caesar, presented on a \"tropaeum\". In a 2011 article Carotta argued for a restitution of the Liberalia (17 March) as the correct date of Caesar's funeral ceremony, and for a dismissal of the chronology developed by 19th century German scholars. In a 2012 book containing earlier and new articles he argued that Fulvia was the mother of Christianity and possibly the author of the ur-gospel.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57522627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57522627", "title": "Hamar Chronicle", "text": "Hamar Chronicle\n\nThe Hamar Chronicle () is a book written in the 1500s by an unknown author. It describes life in the town of Hamar during the Catholic era (until 1537). The book is an important source for the study of Hamar's history because it describes the settlement of the town.\n\nThe book is first and foremost a local patriotic depiction of Hamar in the Middle Ages. It discusses the most important buildings (the cathedral, the bishop's residence, St. Olaf's Monastery, the cruciform church, Saint George's Church, the town hall, and the prison) as well as the life of the town and how it was governed, and it contains a short narrative about the last bishop's departure from the town. In addition, it lists all of the bishops in Hamar during the Catholic era.\n\nThe author of the Hamar Chronicle is unknown, but from the language and the description there is reason to believe that the author was from Hedmarka, if not Hamar itself. On the other hand, the book tells about its origins: on July 22, 1553 many important people gathered at the Hamar farm (i.e., the bishop's residence) to review the bishop's letters and books. Following royal orders from Copenhagen, some of the Catholic archives were to be registered, and lensmann Christen Munk, the son-in-law of Truid Ulfstand, was to be responsible. He had gathered freeholders with allodial tenure and other secular men together, and together they were to record the most important of the town's buildings, streets, organization and population. Strikingly, it also presents many memories of the city's golden age and a narrative of earthquakes and the last bishop's struggle. It is widely believed that these observations were added by Trugels the cantor, the church choral director.\n\nThe Hamar Chronicle describes portents before Bishop Mogens was captured. The chronicle says that in the middle of the night all the bells in the cathedral, the monastery, and the church began to ring of their own accord. In the church and the cathedral it was as though it were the middle of the day, and there was a sound as if two armies would fight. The chronicle goes on to say: \"Dernest om höy dags tijd beteede sig en gresselig stor orm oc forferdelig, som kaldis Siöormen, udi Miöß, som var gandske lang oc meget stor, oc siuntes at naa fra öens landt oc jnd udi Kongsland\" (Next there appeared in the middle of the day an enormously large and abominable sea serpent, called the Sjøorm, in Lake Mjøsa, which was exceedingly long and very large, and it seemed to be coming from the island [i.e., Helgøya, the 'holy island'] and approaching the land of the king.) It then relates how one of the bishop's men killed the beast with an arrow and how they disposed of its enormous carcass.\n\nFinally, the chronicle describes the occasion and the events of the day that Bishop Mogens was captured and sent to Denmark. The bishop had to surrender because of Truid Ulfstand's forces' modern weapons: bullets and gunpowder against the bishop's arrows and crossbows. When the bishop left the city, he fell on his knees and thanked God for every day he had spent in the city. He asked the city to pray for him and said he would return. Then the chronicle states that he prayed: \"O Gud fader udi himmelen, findes vj icke för, da Gud giffue det vj findis i himmerige. Denne bön bad hand med grædende taare oc sagde, vale, vale, vale.\" (O God, Father in heaven, we do not exist for gifts from God, but to find heaven. He prayed this prayer while crying tears, and said farewell, farewell, farewell.)\n\nThe chronicle also describes what Hamar's coat of arms looked like, and it is from this depiction that today's municipal coat of arms was designed in 1899, on the occasion of the town's 50th anniversary. The chronicle states: \"Hammers vaaben det var en vhrhane med udslagen vinger vdi toppen paa it grönt furutræ\" (Hamar's coat of arms was a black grouse with outspread wings at the top of a green pine). The chronicle says that this coat of arms was carved into the woodwork over the town hall in the old marketplace.\n\n"}

Because most insects are small and the majority cannot be identified without the examination of minute morphological characters, entomologists often make and maintain insect collections. Very large collections are conserved in natural history museums or universities where they are maintained and studied by specialists. Many college courses require students to form small collections. There are also amateur entomologists and collectors who keep collections.\n\nHistorically, insect collecting has been widespread and was in the Victorian age a very popular educational hobby. Insect collecting has left traces in European cultural history, literature and songs (e.g., Georges Brassens's \"La chasse aux papillons\" (\"The Hunt for Butterflies\")). The practice is still widespread in many countries, and is particularly common among Japanese youths.\n\nInsects are passively caught using funnels, pitfall traps, bottle traps, malaise traps, flight interception traps and other passive types of insect traps, some of which are baited with small bits of sweet foods (such as honey). Different designs of ultraviolet light traps such as the Robinson trap are also used by entomologists for collecting nocturnal insects (especially moths) during faunistic survey studies. Aspirators or \"pooters\" suck up insects too small or delicate to handle with fingers.\nSeveral different types of nets are commonly used to actively collect insects. Aerial insect nets are used to collect flying insects. The bag of a butterfly net is generally constructed from a lightweight mesh to minimize damage to delicate butterfly wings. A sweep net is used to collect insects from grass and brush. It is similar to a butterfly net, except that the bag is generally constructed from more rugged material.The sweep net is swept back and forth through vegetation quickly turning the opening from side to side and following a shallow figure eight pattern. The collector walks forward while sweeping, and the net is moved through plants and grasses with force.This requires a heavy net fabric such as sailcloth to prevent tearing, although light nets can be used if swept less vigorously. Sweeping continues for some distance and then the net is flipped over, with the bag hanging over the rim, trapping the insects until they can be removed with a pooter. Other types of nets used for collecting insects include beating nets and aquatic nets. Leaf litter sieves are used by coleopterists and to collect larvae.\n\nOnce collected, a killing jar is used to kill required insects before they damage themselves trying to escape. However, killing jars are generally only used on hard-bodied insects. Soft-bodied insects, such as those in the larval stage, are generally fixed in a vial containing an ethanol and water solution. Another now mostly historical approach is Caterpillar inflation where the innards were removed and the skin dried.\n\nThe usual method of display is in a glass-covered box, with the insects mounted on specially made non corrosive insect pins stuck into suitable foam plastic or paper covered cork at the bottom of the box. Common pins are not used. Very small insects may be pinned on \"minuten\" (very tiny headless pins) stuck into a block of foam plastic on a standard insect pin. Alternatively they may be glued onto a small piece of card on the pin. There are specific procedures for proper mounting that are used to show off the insects' essential characteristics. Techniques and equipment may be varied to deal with various species or requirements. For example, one or both of the wings of a beetle or grasshopper can be pulled open and fanned out to show the wing structure that otherwise would be hidden. At least the date and place of capture should be written or computer printed onto a piece of paper or card transfixed by the pin. This is called a data label.\nRare insects, or those from distant parts of the world, may also be acquired from dealers or by trading. Some noted insect collections have been sold at auction.\n\n\"Pokémon\" creator Satoshi Tajiri's childhood hobby of insect collecting is the inspiration behind the popular video game series.\n\n\nPicture Guide series For college students.

Few details are known of his life: after the death of St Nicholas I, he was briefly exiled from Rome at the behest of the emperor Louis II, but was recalled by Adrian II. Possessed of considerable learning, he was closely associated with Anastasius, Librarian of the Roman Church (died 879).\n\nAt the instance of Pope John VIII (872-82), John wrote a life of St. Gregory the Great, making use of the works of this pope and above all of extracts made at an earlier date from the pope's letters in the archives of the Roman Church. The work is divided into four books: in the first he gives an account of the life of Gregory up to the time of his pontificate; in the second, of his activities as pope; in the third, of his teachings; and in the fourth, of his progress in perfection. The life was most recently edited by the Maurists. For John VIII, John also composed in 876 an adaptation of the Cena Cypriani.\n\nJohn also intended to write a detailed history of the Church, and at his request the aforesaid Anastasius compiled a history in three parts (\"tripartita\") from Greek sources for the use of John, whose purpose, however, was never executed. On the invitation of Bishop Gaudericus of Velletri (867-79), he undertook to re-edit the \"Gesta Clementis\", a life of Pope Clement I (died about end of the 1st century), but did not live to finish the work, which Gaudericus undertook to complete, though it never appeared in full. \n\nA letter from a certain Johannes Diaconus to Senarius, \"vir illustris\", treats of the ceremonies of baptism; it is not however, the work of the John treated here, but of an older deacon of this name.

In post-World War II Germany, after the defeat of the Nazis and Nazi Germany, the far-right was outlawed by the Allied occupation forces, preventing political continuity of the Nazi Party in a new, post-war form. In West Germany, reformed far-right parties were able to reestablish a foot hold in the national parliament in the early years of the new Federal Republic, courtesy in part to the post-war issues the new country faced. With the recovery of the German economy, the \"Wirtschaftswunder\", the far-right declined in appeal. The far-right, from the 1960s, was characterised by fragmentation and infighting. Following the German reunification, in the early 1990s, the far-right has regained strength and become more of a threat to the democratic Germany again.\n\nIn East Germany, a communist country, the far-right was declared extinct by the government despite the fact that a quarter of all members of the ruling communist party, in 1954, had formerly been members of the Nazi Party. Despite the official line, racism and far-right ideology existed and, towards the end of the country's existence in the late 1980s, increased. It was however swept under the carpet by the ruling authorities as ordinary violence and hooliganism rather than being allowed to be seen as a resurface of far-right ideology.\n\nThe German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the far-right () as a movement against the equality of all people as guaranteed by the German constitution, and as enemies of the democratic nature of the German state. Their aim is to establish an authoritarian state, modelled on the \"Führerprinzip\". The far-right places undue value on race and ethnicity which results in xenophobia and racism. Antisemitism is a core principal of their ideology. Far-right publications generally glorify Germany's Nazi past and the armed forces of the era, the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS, offering historically revisionist publications and attempting to promote the myth of the \"Clean Wehrmacht\" and \"Clean Waffen-SS\". Far-right publisher are however careful to not out-rightly deny or trivialise the Holocaust, this being a criminal offence in Germany, as many have been prosecuted for such offences in the past.\n\nThe German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, as of 2017, classifies three political parties as far-right, the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), \"Die Rechte\" and Der III. Weg, with a combined membership of 6,050.\n\nHistorically, a small number of long-standing far-right newspapers and magazines have been published since the early 1950s, like the \"National Zeitung\" and \"Nation Europa\", while a larger number of publications have only existed for a short duration. The pulp magazine \"Der Landser\", which existed for almost 60 years, glorified the German armed forces and omit the war crimes committed by Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS, without providing any historical context and was eventually terminated after a complaint by the Simon Wiesenthal Center.\n\nThe far-right print media in Germany is predominately organised in the \"\", GfP, the largest far-right association of publishers, authors and book sellers, which was formed by former SS officers and Nazi officials in 1960.

J. K.; January 15, 1828 – March 23, 1890) was a Canadian author, editor, historian, and poet. \n\nKatzmann published short poems from time to time, and afterwards became a regular contributor to various periodicals and newspapers, including the \"Colonist\", the \"Record\", and the \"Guardian\". For two years, she edited the \"Provincial Magazine\", one of the earliest of its kind published in Halifax. For this, she wrote \"Tales of our Village,\"—sketches of the early history of Dartmouth and Preston interwoven with local traditions. She invariably signed all she wrote with her initials, M. J. K., and by this sobriquet, became well known to all her friends.\n\nShe was married in 1869 to William Lawson, Esq., of Halifax, in which town she was then living. After her marriage, her time was largely given to work among the poor, and to social and benevolent schemes, particularly those connected with the Church of England, of which she was a devoted member. She preserved to the end of her life that love for literary work which she had early displayed, and any event of interest in the community was sure to call forth sympathetic lines which were now signed with the initials M. J. K. L. In 1887, she obtained the Akins Historical Prize of King's College, Windsor, for her \"History of the, Townxhi* of Dartmouth, Preston, and Lawrencetown\". She died at Halifax, on Sunday, March 23, 1890, after several weeks of painful illness, leaving one child, a daughter.\n\nMary Jane Katzmann was born at \"Maroon Hall\" in Preston, Nova Scotia, the second daughter of Mary Prescott and Lieutenant Christian Conrad Casper Katzmann. Her father, who was a native of Hanover, Germany, came to Nova Scotia with H. M. 60th Regiment, or King's German Legion, in which he was a Lieutenant. earned a British Army commission in the Peninsular War. When he left the regiment, about 1822, he settled in Preston, where he resided until his death on December 15, 1843. Her mother was a Nova Scotian, a granddaughter of Dr. Jonathan Prescott, of Massachusetts, who came to Nova Scotia and settled there with other New England Loyalists. Through him the family claims relationship with the historian Prescott.\n\nFrom a very early age, Katzmann showed unusual intelligence and signs of that love for literature which always characterized her. She could read at the age of three, and from that time devoured eagerly the limited number of books which were at her disposal in Maroon Hall. \"Scott's Tales of a Grandfather\" and \"Chambers Journal\" were her especial favourites. Owing to the remoteness of the country district in which she lived, educational advantages were few; and, save for the help given by her own family, she was almost entirely self-taught. Her quickness of perception and wonderful memory no doubt compensated to a great extent for the lack of other advantages.led there with other New England Loyalists. Through him the family claims relationship with the historian Prescott.\n\nIn 1845, her poetry came to the attention of Joseph Howe, who praised it in his \"Nights with the Muses\" column in \"The Nova Scotian.\" Between 1848 and 1851, Katzmann published a large amount of verse in the \"Halifax Guardian\".\n\nIn January 1852, she became editor of \"The Provincial,\" a new literary journal, \"and under her expert guidance it became possibly the best of the early Nova Scotian periodicals. The format and printing were superior, and the quality of the contributions was commendable... Katzmann tailored her publication to attract a wide audience, both male and female; she also strove to include articles of regional origin rather than selected reprints.\"\n\nThe magazine \"was well received by its readers but sufficient subscriptions were not forthcoming, and publication ceased with the December 1853 issue. Nothing further is known of the editor until 1866, when she was operating the Provincial Bookstore in Halifax.\"\n\nIn 1869, Katzmann married Halifax businessman William Lawson. She turned over the bookstore to her sister, and became a proper non-working Victorian wife (though she continued to write). She spent much time on \"charitable and social causes, particularly those associated with the Church of England.\" They had one daughter.\n\nLawson worked a series she had written in the \"Provincial\", \"Tales of Our Village,\" into the book, \"History of the Townships of Dartmouth, Preston and Lawrencetown, Halifax County, N.S.\", for which she won the Akins Historical Prize from King's College in 1887.\n\nShe died of cancer in Halifax in 1890.\n\nHer two books, \"Frankincense and Myrrh\" (a collection of her poetry) and \"History of the Townships of Dartmouth, Preston, and Lawrencetown, Halifax County, N.S.\",\" were published posthumously in 1893, edited by poet Constance Fairbanks and historian Harry Piers.\n\n\"As a poet Katzmann was prone to generalities, melodramatic effects, and dull religious and moral didacticism — characteristics that mark the verse of contemporary ‘female poets’ in Britain and the United States upon whom she patterned herself,\" says the \"Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature\", \"but she was always technically competent, at her best when writing descriptive verse or charming song-like lyrics.\"\n\n\"The Dictionary of Canadian Biography (DCBO)\" calls her prize-winning historical study, \"History of the Townships of Dartmouth, Preston and Lawrencetown, Halifax County, N.S.\", \"her enduring contribution to Canadian literature. Although it relies heavily on description and anecdote, and reads much like a Victorian travelogue, the book nevertheless reveals a fine sense of historical detail and comprehension.\" As well, \"although it can in no way be compared to a modern sociological study, it does convey, in a fashion which many early regional histories lack, a colourful sense of the people and the times.\"\n\nThe \"DCBO\" says of Katzmann's career: \"In an age when women accomplished little beyond the circle of home and charity, her success, although limited to the provincial sphere, was threefold: as the capable and youthful editor of a successful, if short-lived, periodical, as an able businesswoman in a circle dominated by male initiative, and as one of the first native Nova Scotian women to achieve literary recognition, and certainly the first to make an enduring impression.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16436951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16436951", "title": "More danico", "text": "More danico\n\nThe phrase more danico is a Medieval Latin legal expression which may be translated as \"in the Danish manner\", i.e. under Medieval Scandinavian customary law\". It designates a type of traditional marriage practiced in northern Europe during the Middle Ages.\n\n\"Danish\" formerly meant \"Norse\" (cf. Danish tongue).\n\nThe examples that have come down to us involve powerful rulers in a union with a highborn woman of somewhat lesser rank. Rarely, it occurred to legitimize an abduction, as with Rollo and Poppa, who was taken after a battle at Bayeux; but this is not a defining characteristic. While Roman law had not distinguished between elopement and bride kidnapping (both being \"raptus in parentes\"), the distinction was significant in Germanic law. Still, according to Reynolds, the consent of the \"parentes\" was required in the \"more danico\" case. This consent could still be obtained after the fact, if an elopement was involved.\n\nThe word \"secular\" here should not be interpreted to mean that no context of Germanic religion was involved. Although the form of any ritual that might have been employed is unknown, it is sometimes assumed that it was a type of handfasting.\n\n\"More danico\" permitted polygyny (serial or simultaneous), but is not synonymous with it. The \"putting away\" of a \"more danico\" wife could apparently be done at the mere wish of the husband; the rights of the wife are unclear. Often the putting away was done with the intention of marrying a still higher-ranking woman \"more christiano\"; but since there are numerous instances of the husband returning to the \"more danico\" wife, it is possible that the relationship had merely been deactivated or kept in the background. The union could also be fully dissolved, so that the wife was free to marry another man. Her consent in the matter may or may not have been required; again, the consensual aspect is unknown. (See below.)\n\nBy tradition and customary law, the children of such a relationship were in no way considered of lesser rank or disadvantaged with respect to inheritance. Many sons \"more danico\" went on to become dukes or kings by succession or conquest.\n\nIncreasingly discouraged by the Christian Church, the practice gradually died out. Proponents of the Friedelehe theory claimed that the institution left a vestige in the institution of morganatic marriage, but this interpretation is now discredited .\n\nIt was not until the nation consciousness of the western nations was well developed and national laws were codified that it became the norm that all persons in a country were to be subject to the same law. Previously, each man was held accountable according to the laws of his own people.\nBy accepting baptism and vassalage under a Christian prince under Charles the Simple after the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte in 911, Rollo had placed the Vikings of Normandy on the inevitable path of Christianization; but they clung to some old customs.\n\nThere was a perennial political tension between canon law and the traditional law. The Church deprecated this type of traditional union, employing the terms \"bastardy\" and \"concubinage\". On a purely political level, temporal rulers of more fully Christianized entities did not ignore the advantage of denigrating their enemies in moral terms with respect to their marriage customs.\n\nThe instrumentality of Christian clergy at a marriage ceremony was not specifically required by the Church until the Council of Trent on November 11, 1563.\n\nThe Roman ethnographer Tacitus writing in his \"De origine et situ Germanorum\" described the customs of the Germanic tribes and praised their monogamy. However, by the Viking Age they had acquired a reputation for their polygyny.\n\nSpeaking of the Swedes, Adam von Bremen said: \n\nNorman chronicler William of Jumieges uses the term explicitly to refer to two relationships:\n\n\nModern historians have applied the term to various irregular or polygynous unions formed by several other monarchs of the Viking age, including Harald Fairhair, Canute the Great, Harold Godwinson and Cerball mac Dúnlainge.\n\nKnown to us from the histories of William of Jumièges and Orderic Vitalis, the purport of the phrase \"more danico\" is based in both the historical context, as well as in the meaning of the words within the fabric of the Latin language and the underlying Old Norse.\n\nOrderic Vitalis spoke Old English until the age of ten, when he was forced to adopt Norman French; he wrote in a stilted, but fluent and educated Medieval Latin. In the vernacular he would have spoken of the custom as \"danesche manere\" (Norman French), as would William of Jumièges, who was Norman, but also wrote in Latin.\n\n\"More\" \"by custom\" is the ablative case of the Latin word for \"manner\", the subject form being \"mos\" (cf. \"More judaico\", \"according to Jewish custom\").\nIn Lewis & Short's \"Latin Dictionary\", the semantic range of the Latin word \"mos\" is elongated along the axis of \"arbitrary↔required\", extending from \"wont\" or \"caprice\" on the one end, to \"law\" or \"precept\" on the other end:\n\n\nThus the term \"mos/mor-\" captures the ambiguity between the official Christian view of the practice as a despicable and self-indulgent \"fashion\", on the one hand, and the Germanic institution sanctioned by ancient traditional \"law\", on the other hand (cf. Marriage \"à la façon du pays\", \"marriage according to local custom\").\n\nDuring the Viking Age, the essentially tribal entities that became the modern Scandinavian nations differed in some customs, but had a concept of themselves as a unity. For example, according to the Gray Goose Laws of the Icelandic Commonwealth recorded in 1117, Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders and Danes spoke the same language, using \"dǫnsk tunga\" or \"dansk tunga\" (\"Danish tongue\") or \"norrønt mál\" (\"Nordic language\") to name their language, Old Norse. Here \"dansk\" meant \"Norse\". Furthermore,\"more danico\" (Danish \"efter dansk skik\") was not merely a \"Norse custom\", but prevalent among other Germanic peoples such as the Franks (see above).\n\nIt is also worth noting that Rollo, founder of the Norman dynasty, is claimed as Norwegian in the Norse sagas, but as Danish by William of Jumièges.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27899755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27899755", "title": "Movses Khorenatsi", "text": "Movses Khorenatsi\n\nMovses Khorenatsi (ca. 410–490s AD; , , also written as \"Movsēs Xorenac‘i\" and Moses of Khoren, Moses of Chorene, and Moses Chorenensis in Latin sources) was a prominent Armenian historian from the period of Late Antiquity and the author of the \"History of Armenia\".\n\nKhorenatsi is credited with the earliest known historiographical work on the history of Armenia written in Armenian, but was also a poet, or hymn writer, and a grammarian. The \"History of Armenia\" was written at the behest of Prince Sahak of the Bagratuni dynasty and has had an enormous impact on Armenian historiography. It was used and quoted extensively by later medieval Armenian authors. Although other Armenians such as Agathangelos had previously written histories on Armenia, Movses' work holds particular significance because it contains unique material on the old oral traditions in Armenia before its conversion to Christianity and, more importantly, traces Armenian history from Movses' day back to its origins.\n\nKhorenatsi is considered to be the \"father of Armenian history\" (\"patmahayr\"), and is sometimes referred to as the \"Armenian Herodotus.\" Khorenatsi's work became the first attempt of a universal history of Armenia.\n\nMovses identified himself as a young disciple of Mesrop Mashtots, inventor of the Armenian alphabet, and is recognized by the Armenian Apostolic Church as one of the Holy Translators.\n\nMovses' biographical details are given at the very end of the \"History of the Armenians\" but additional information provided by later medieval Armenian historians have allowed modern scholars to piece together additional information on him. Movses was believed to have been born in the village of Khorni (also spelled as Khoron and Khoronk) in the Armenian province of Taron or Turuberan sometime in 410. However, some scholars contend that if he was born here, he would have then been known as Movses of Khorneh or Khoron. They instead move the location of his birth from Taron to the Armenian province of Syunik, in the village of Khorena in the region of Harband.\n\nHe received his education in Syunik' and was later sent to be taught under the auspices of Mesrop Mashtots, the creator of the Armenian alphabet, and Catholicos Sahak Partev. In having considerable difficulty translating the Bible from Greek to Armenian, Mesrop and Sahak felt the need to send Movses and several of their other students to Alexandria, Egypt, at that time the center of education and learning, so that they themselves learn the Greek and Syriac languages, as well as grammar, oratory, theology and philosophy.\n\nThe students left Armenia sometime between 432 and 435. First they went to Edessa where they studied at the local libraries. Then they moved towards Jerusalem and Alexandria. After studying in Alexandria for five to six years, Movses and his classmates returned to Armenia, only to find that Mesrop and Sahak had died. Movses expressed his grief in a lament at the end of \"History of the Armenians\":\n\nTo further complicate their problems, the atmosphere in Armenia that Movses and the other students had returned to was one that was extremely hostile and they were viewed at with contempt by the native population. While later Armenian historians blamed this on an ignorant populace, Persian ideology and policy also lay at fault, since its rulers \"could not tolerate highly educated young scholars fresh from Greek centers of learning.\" Given this atmosphere and persecution by the Persians, Movses went into hiding in a village near Vagharshapat and lived in relative seclusion for several decades.\nGyut, Catholicos of All Armenians (461–471), one day met Movses while traveling through the area and, unaware of his true identity, invited him to supper with several of his students. Movses was initially silent, but after Gyut's students encouraged him to speak, Movses made a marvelous speech at the dinner table. One of the Catholicos' students was able to identify Movses as a person Gyut had been searching for; it was soon understood that Gyut was one of Movses' former classmates and friends. Gyut embraced Movses and, being either a Chalcedonian Christian, or, at least, tolerant of them (since Movses was also Chalcedonian), brought his friend back from seclusion and appointed him to be a bishop in Bagrevan.\n\nServing as a bishop, Movses was approached by Prince Sahak Bagratuni (died in 482 during Charmana battle against Persian army), who, having heard of Movses' reputation, asked him to write a history of the Armenians, especially the biographies of Armenian kings and the origins of the Armenian \"nakharar\" families. Armenian historian Artashes Matevosyan placed Movses' completion of \"History\" to the year based on his research on the \"Chronicle\" by the sixth century Armenian historian Atanas Taronatsi.\n\nOne of his primary reasons for taking up Sahak Bagratuni's request is given in the first part of \"Patmutyun Hayots\", or \"History of the Armenians\": \"For even though we are small and very limited in numbers and have been conquered many times by foreign kingdoms, yet too, many acts of bravery have been performed in our land, worthy of being written and remembered, but of which no one has bothered to write down.\" His work is a first historical record that covered the whole history of Armenia from a very ancient period until the death of the historian. His \"History\" served as a textbook to study the history of Armenia until the eighteenth century. Movses' history also gives a rich description of the oral traditions that were popular among the Armenians of the time, such as the romance story of \"Artashes and Satenik\" and the birth of the god Vahagn. Movses lived for several more years, and he died sometime in the late .\n\nThree possible early references to Movses in other sources are usually identified. The first one is in Ghazar Parpetsi’s \"History of the Armenians\" (about 500 A.D.), where the author details the persecution of several notable Armenian individuals, including the “blessed Movses the philosopher,” identified by some scholars as Movses Khorenatsi. But there is no indication in Parpetsi that this Movses had \"composed any historical works.\" The second one is the \"Book of Letters\" (sixth century), which contains a short theological treatise by \"Movses Khorenatsi.\" However, this treatise, not being an historical work, cannot be convincingly attributed to the historian Movses. The third possible early reference is in a tenth-eleventh centuries manuscript containing a list of dates attributed to Athanasius (Atanas) of Taron (sixth century): under the year 474, the list has \"Moses of Chorene, philosopher and writer.\" This mention is, however, considered as too uncertain.\n\nBeginning in the nineteenth century, as a part of a general trend in those years to reexamine critically the validity of classical sources, Movses' \"History\" was cast into doubt. The conclusions reached by Alfred von Gutschmid ushered in the \"hypercritical phase\" of the study of Movses' work. Many European and Armenian scholars writing at the turn of the twentieth century reduced its importance as a historical source and dated the \"History\" to sometime in the seventh to ninth centuries. Stepan Malkhasyants, an Armenian philologist and expert of Classical Armenian literature, likened this early critical period from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries to a \"competition,\" whereby one scholar attempted to outperform the other in their criticism of Movses.\n\nIn the early decades of the twentieth century, scholars such as F. C. Conybeare, Manuk Abeghian, and Stepan Malkhasyants rejected the conclusions of the scholars of the hypercritical school. Ethnographic and archaeological research during this time confirmed information which was found only in Movses' work and supported their view to move back the dating to the fifth century. \n\nEarlier critical points were revived in the second half of the twentieth century. For instance Robert W. Thomson, the former holder of the chair in Armenian Studies at Harvard University and the translator of several classical Armenian works, claimed that Movses' account contained various anachronisms. His approach in evaluating Movses's work was criticized when the English translation of \"History of the Armenians\" appeared in 1978. The points he raised have since been challenged. Vrej Nersessian, the Curator of the Christian Middle East Section at the British Library, took issue with many of Thomson’s points, including his later dating of the writing and his contention that Movses was merely writing an apologist work for the Bagratunis:\n\nGagik Sargsyan, an Armenian scholar of the Classics and a leading biographer of Movses, also admonished Thomson for anachronistic hypercriticism and for stubbornly rehashing and \"even exaggerating the statements once put forward\" by the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century scholars, and in particular, by Grigor Khalatyants (1858–1912). Sargsyan noted that Thomson, in condemning Movses' failure to mention his sources, ignored the fact that \"an antique or medieval author may have had his own rules of mentioning the sources distinct from the rules of modern scientific ethics.\" Thomson's allegation of Movses' plagiarism and supposed distortion of sources was also countered by scholars who contended that Thomson was \"treating a medieval author with the standards\" of twentieth century historiography and pointed out that numerous classical historians, Greek and Roman alike, engaged in the same practice. Aram Topchyan, a Research Fellow at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem of Armenian Studies, concurred with this observation, and noted that it was odd that Thomson would fault Movses for failing to mention his sources because this was an accepted practice among all classical historians.\n\nKhorenatsi's work is recognized as an important source for the research of Urartian and early Armenian history.\n\nThe following works are also attributed to Movses:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "703035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=703035", "title": "Near Eastern archaeology", "text": "Near Eastern archaeology\n\nNear Eastern Archaeology (sometimes known as Middle Eastern archaeology) is a regional branch of the wider, global discipline of archaeology. It refers generally to the excavation and study of artifacts and material culture of the Near East from antiquity to the recent past.\n\nThe description \"Near Eastern\" for this branch of archaeology is, of course, highly Eurocentric and Americocentric, reflecting the origins and growth of the field in Western academic traditions. However, in the absence of better solutions, and the continued heavy involvement of Western academics, the term has taken hold and remains in frequent use.\n\nThe definition of the Near East is usually based on the Fertile Crescent; the region between the Nile Valley (modern Egypt) and Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Also usually included are Iran, the Arabian peninsula and its islands, Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), Cyprus and North Africa west of Egypt. The history of archaeological investigation in this region grew out of the 19th century discipline of Biblical archaeology, efforts mostly by Europeans to uncover evidence for Biblical (Old and New Testaments) narratives. Much archaeological work in this region is still influenced by that discipline, although within the last three decades there has been a marked tendency by some archaeologists to dissociate their work from Biblical frameworks.\n\nNear Eastern Archaeology is a term with a wide, often generalised application, and is frequently divided into further regional sub-branches, the archaeology of modern states in the region or along broad thematic lines. Regions can be loosely defined, but are often based on recognizable entities that evidence cultural cohesion and coincide with topographical zones. Scholars may differ on the way the region is divided. Regional divisions also may change from period to period.\n\nThe most common fields of study are Biblical archaeology dealing with the region and history of the Bible; Assyriology dealing with Mesopotamia; Egyptology dealing with the ancient history of what is today Egypt and parts of the Sudan; and prehistoric archaeology which is not tied to a region but instead deals with the origins of culture before the invention of writing.\n\nEgyptology is one example of a specialized branch that deals with the Nile Valley cultures of Egypt and associated regions in sub-Saharan Africa, the Sinai Peninsula to the east, and parts of North Africa. It includes language studies, history and archaeology and their related disciplines. Nowadays, there is much work also done on the prehistoric archaeological record and its practitioners are best described as prehistorians.\n\nThe name Levant (or Syria-Palestine) is used to refer to the area adjacent to the east coast of the Mediterranean. The southern region included in this term encompasses Israel, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and part of Jordan. Palestine was its ancient Roman and Byzantine name and was also in use during the Crusades (1095–1291), the period of Ottoman rule (1517-1917) and the British Mandate (1918–1948). The same region is also called the Holy Land, the Land of Israel, and Canaan because of biblical associations. The foregoing names can be perceived as having political overtones, meaning that the more neutral, geographically based term the southern Levant has become popular with archaeologists who wish to refer to this area without prejudice or political orientation. In many contexts the Sinai Peninsula is also considered to be part of the southern Levant, although it is part of the modern state of Egypt. Archaeologically, it is distinguished from the heartland of Egypt, the Nile Valley and Delta.\n\nThe term northern Levant can be used to refer to Lebanon, the Syrian littoral and portions of the Mediterranean coast of Turkey in the province of Hatay. More usually, these regions are included in greater Syria, a name used to refer to the whole area between Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Arabia. The Mediterranean coast of Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and parts of Northern Israel are also known as Phoenicia, after the ancient kingdom. However, this term suffers from the same problems as Canaan and equivalents and so is generally now only used in a strict historical sense.\n\nThe landmass of Anatolia, most of modern Turkey, is bordered by several seas and includes parts of Northern Mesopotamia. The Tigris and Euphrates rise in Turkey and flow south into Iraq.\n\nCyprus (ancient Alashiya), a large island in the eastern Mediterranean was a separate cultural entity during most periods of human occupation. However, its proximity to both Anatolia and the northern and southern Levant was responsible for influences from and to both these regions. This was especially the case as Cyprus was an important source of copper for much of the region.\n\nMesopotamia (\"The Land of Two Rivers\") is considered to begin more or less near the modern border with Iraq and refers to the flat valley of the southern Tigris and Euphrates rivers and their tributaries. These rivers empty into the Shatt al-Arab waterway that separates Iraq from Iran. Sumerology is a very specialized discipline that deals with the history, language and archaeology of ancient Sumer (southern Mesopotamia), mostly during the 4th and 3rd millennium BCE. Assyriology deals with the Assyrians who succeeded the Sumerians and covers much of the region while that language was still in use.\n\nIran, sometimes known as Persia, includes a large plateau and its periphery, including the Zagros Mountains. Sub-disciplines of this region deal mostly with the languages, history and archaeology of regions within this large area.\n\nThe Arabian Peninsula and its offshore islands is a separate geographical zone that has contacts with Sinai, the well-watered regions to the north, and by sea with the far-east.\n\nDue to the historic interest in the archaeology of the Near East, especially due to the Biblical links of the area, there are a large number of organisations dedicated to the archaeological investigation of the region. These include the American Schools of Oriental Research which publishes the journal \"Near Eastern Archaeology Magazine\", the Council for British Research in the Levant which publishes the journal Levant, and The Netherlands Institute for the Near East which publishes the journal Bibliotheca Orientalis.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52365696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52365696", "title": "North European hypothesis", "text": "North European hypothesis\n\nThe North European hypothesis was a linguistic and archaeological theory that tried to explain the spread of the Indo-European languages in Eurasia from an original homeland (Urheimat) located in southern Scandinavia or in the North German Plain. This hypothesis, advanced by Karl Penka, Hermann Hirt, Gustaf Kossinna and others, had some success in the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century being endorsed by National Socialism but is today considered outdated by the majority of the academics who tend to favor the Kurgan hypothesis.\nIt has been recently recovered by Jean Haudry and Carl-Heinz Boettcher.\n\nAccording to Penka, the first to propose a Nordic Urheimat, the primitive Indo-European people had to be sedentary farmers native of the north, formed without external interference since the Paleolithic. The presence of the term to indicate the copper (*\"ayes\") in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European vocabulary would restrict the homeland (Urheimat) in a culture of the late Neolithic or the Chalcolithic. Terms in favor of a northern location would be, among others, the ones to indicate the beech (\"bhāghos\") and the sea (*\"mori\").\n\nFor Boettcher, the very first period of formation of the future proto-Indo-European peoples began in the late Paleolithic, when global warming, which followed the Wurm glaciation, allowed to the hunter-gatherers settled in the gliacial shelters to repopulate northern Europe, now free of ices. They gave rise to archaeological manifestations such as the Hamburg culture and the Federmesser culture. In these areas of the north are common boreal phenomena apparently described in some indoeuropean myths. These groups of hunters and fishermen are the basis of the next Maglemosian culture (9000-6500 BC approximately). The rising of the sea level in northern Europe caused the flooding of part of the territories occupied by Maglemosians (Doggerland) and drove them south. The heirs of this culture developed the cultures of Ertebølle and Ellerbek. Boettcher compares their activities with those of the Vikings of the following millenniums. They are described as a developing warrior society, which deals with trade and piracy, going up the rivers to raid the lands occupied by the Danubian farmers of the southern plains, subduing them and become their leaders.\n\nThe fusion of these two populations gave rise to the so-called Funnelbeaker culture (4200-2600 BC), extended from the Netherlands to north-western Ukraine, which would be the original habitat of the first Indo-Europeans; for Haudry \"The Neolithic Funnelbecker culture agrees well with the traditional image of the Indo-European people confirmed by linguistic paleontology: in this culture there are simultaneously breeding and plant cultivation, the horse, the wagon and the battle-axe, fortifications and signs of a hierarchically organized society \". The first Indo-European culture would be then a synthesis of the Ertebølle culture and the final stages of the Linear Pottery culture. This prehistoric fusion of two different populations would explain some common myths to the Indo-European mythology studied by Georges Dumezil as the Rape of the Sabines in Rome or the war between the Aesir and Vanir of Norse mythology, that would show the union between warrior groups and groups of producers/farmers.\n\nLater cultures, such as the Globular Amphora culture and the Corded Ware culture would represent the expansion of the Indo-Europeans (or \"Indogermanen\") from their original locations in the North European Plain toward Russia (Middle Dnieper culture, Fatyanovo-Balanovo culture) and Asia (Koban culture). Similar movements of Nordic populations would have irradiated from the north to the west and the south of Europe, including in Anatolia (Troy,) between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age.\n\n\n"}

Scarrow completed a master's degree at the University of East Anglia after working at the Inland Revenue, and then went into teaching as a lecturer, firstly at East Norfolk Sixth Form College, then at City College Norwich.\n\nHe is best known for his \"Eagles of the Empire\" series of Roman military fiction set in the territories of the Roman Empire, covering the second invasion of Britain and the subsequent prolonged campaign undertaken by the rump of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. As of June 2016, there are 16 books in the series; the latest, \"Day of the Caesars\", was published in 2017.\n\nHe has also written another series, \"Revolution\", focusing on Wellington and Napoleon, whose first title, \"Young Bloods\", was published in 2006. The second volume, \"The Generals\", was released on 31 May 2007 and the third volume \"Fire and Sword\" was released in January 2009. The fourth and final novel of the series was released in Jun 2010 and is called \"The Fields of Death\". He began publishing a new series in 2011 titled \"Gladiator\".\n\nAsked by the \"Edinburgh Book Review\" about the inspiration behind his interest in the Roman era, Scarrow said, \"Firstly, great Latin teachers – Gordon Rodway and then Reg Nash, who inspired a love of the language and more enduringly a fascination with Roman history and culture. Secondly, when I was growing up in the seventies swords and sandals epics seemed to be on the TV regularly. Not to mention the brilliant \"I, Claudius\"\". Scarrow cites the inspiration for his 'earthy' characters as being from his time in the Officer Training Corps.\n\nThe \"Eagles of the Empire\" series centres upon two main protagonists, Quintus Licinius Cato and Lucius Cornelius Macro, who are both Roman soldiers. Macro, a veteran with nearly 15 years' service (at the start of the first novel) in the Roman Army, has recently been appointed to the Centurionate. Cato is in his teen years, grew up in the Imperial Palace as a slave, and at the start of the series joins the Eagles as Macro's Optio. The first book starts in 42 AD. The books cover the experiences of the two soldiers, initially as experienced centurion and new optio, in battles in Germania and the invasion of Britain by Claudius as part of the Legio II Augusta. The 6th book \"The Eagle's Prophecy\" has them serving as part of the Imperial Navy east of Italy. The 7th and 8th put them in Rome's eastern provinces as agents of the Emperor's secretary Tiberius Claudius Narcissus. The 9th sees them shipwrecked on the island of Crete, fighting against a full-scale uprising. The 11th is set in Rome with the leads hoping to save the emperor from the shady Liberators. \"The Blood Crows\" is set once again in Britannia. The two protagonists are faced with defeating tribal rebels.\n\nThe two characters Cato and Macro were additionally used in one book of the TimeRiders series: Gates of Rome. They served as supporting characters when the three protagonists travel back to ancient Rome. Scarrow allowed his brother Alex to make use of the characters in his novel.\n\nIn 2007 the publisher announced the intention to cease using the word \"Eagle\" in the title of books in this series, starting with \"Centurion\". The change was apparently because the publisher wanted to attract more new readers to the series.\n\n\n\"The Revolution Quartet\" centres upon the lives of Napoleon Bonaparte and Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington. The first book in the quartet starts in 1769, and follows the two young men through their youth and onto their military careers.\n\n\nThe \"Gladiator\" series is aimed at the young adult audience, unlike his \"Eagle\" series.\n\n\n\n\nThe following are books which are either stand-alone novels or have yet to be confirmed as parts of a series.\n\n\n\nIn November 2006, Simon Scarrow was accepted to fill the post of Writer in Residence at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys, a position he said he was \"honoured to accept\".\n\nSimon Scarrow's brother, Alex Scarrow, is also an author of numerous novels.\n\n"}

Every language in a language family that descends from the same language as the others is a sister to them.\n\nA commonly given example is the Romance languages, each one of which is a continuation of spoken Latin. Italian and French have about 89% lexical overlap, meaning the words share 89 percent of the same characteristics and root origins. Both Italian and French have a huge number of similar words. Similarly, Spanish and Portuguese have about 89% lexical overlap, so many words are shared or similar between those two languages (see also cognates). Spanish and Romanian's overlap is lower, at about 67%. Spanish and Portuguese have undergone Arabic influence and Romanian has undergone many different influences over the years, particularly from the Slavic languages and Greek. Along with a large amount of shared vocabulary, the Romance languages share numerous features of morphology and syntax because they are all continuations of their common ancestor, Latin. \n\nThe Scots language is considered to be a sister language of English, as they are both descended from the common ancestor Old English (via Early Middle English). The phonological development of the two languages is divergent, with different loanwords entering each language from sources such as Norse, Latin and French. Political and cultural events have largely dictated the decline of broad Scots as a standard variety in the modern period, and Scots is currently confined to largely spoken use and unofficial functions.\n\n"}

The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive wooden horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.\n\nTrojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering, for example where a user is duped into executing an e-mail attachment disguised to appear not suspicious, (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on some fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else . Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer. Trojans may allow an attacker to access users' personal information such as banking information, passwords, or personal identity. It can infect other devices connected to the network. Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a Trojan.\n\nUnlike computer viruses and worms, Trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.\n\nThis terminology occurred for the first time in a US Air Force report in 1974 on the analysis of vulnerability in computer systems. It was made popular by Ken Thompson in his 1983 Turing Award acceptance lecture \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\", subtitled:\nHe mentioned that he knew about the possible existence of Trojan horses in a report on the security of Multics of which he was unfortunately unable to find a reference. However Paul Karger and Roger Schell affirm that this is their above cited report.\n\nTrojan in this way may require interaction with a malicious controller (not necessarily distributing the Trojan) to fulfill their purpose. It is possible for those involved with Trojans to scan computers on a network to locate any with a Trojan installed, which the hacker can then control.\n\nSome Trojans take advantage of a security flaw in older versions of Internet Explorer and Google Chrome to use the host computer as an anonymizer proxy to effectively hide Internet usage, enabling the controller to use the Internet for illegal purposes while all potentially incriminating evidence indicates the infected computer or its IP address. The host's computer may or may not show the internet history of the sites viewed using the computer as a proxy. The first generation of anonymizer Trojan horses tended to leave their tracks in the page view histories of the host computer. Later generations of the Trojan tend to \"cover\" their tracks more efficiently. Several versions of Sub7 have been widely circulated in the US and Europe and became the most widely distributed examples of this type of Trojan.\n\nIn German-speaking countries, spyware used or made by the government is sometimes called \"govware\". Govware is typically a Trojan software used to intercept communications from the target computer. Some countries like Switzerland and Germany have a legal framework governing the use of such software. Examples of govware Trojans include the Swiss MiniPanzer and MegaPanzer and the German \"state trojan\" nicknamed R2D2. German govware works by exploiting security gaps unknown to the general public and accessing smartphone data before it becomes encrypted via other applications.\n\nDue to the popularity of botnets among hackers and the availability of advertising services that permit authors to violate their users' privacy, Trojans are becoming more common. According to a survey conducted by BitDefender from January to June 2009, \"Trojan-type malware is on the rise, accounting for 83-percent of the global malware detected in the world.\" Trojans have a relationship with worms, as they spread with the help given by worms and travel across the internet with them. BitDefender has stated that approximately 15% of computers are members of a botnet, usually recruited by a Trojan infection.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was designed by Simon Wiesenthal as well as international and Austrian researchers. The institute is located in Vienna, Austria. It is financed by the City of Vienna and the Austrian .\n\nThe Jewish Community Vienna (Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien, IKG) and several other renowned institutions initiated the idea to establish an international Shoah research institute in Vienna in 2002. Simon Wiesenthal was still personally involved in designing the concept for the institute before his death in 2005.\n\nIn December 2002, the City of Vienna confirmed that it would financially support the project with a sum to match that to be provided by the Republic of Austria. In March 2008, support by the Republic of Austria for the VWI was also finally confirmed in a speech in the council of ministers. There followed the establishment of the office, taking up work in the spring of 2009.\n\nThe preliminary phase in 2010 and 2011 is to see the groundwork being laid for a specialized scholarly library and an institute-affiliated archive (based on the Holocaust-relevant documents of the IKG archive) as well as the design and trial of various forms of public events – such as lectures, book presentations, conferences and workshops as well as public media interventions in remembrance of the Shoah. This was followed by the preparation of a scholarly research program as well as a long-term development plan for the institute.\n\nIn December 2016, VWI moved to its new premises in the city centre of Vienna on Rabensteig 3.\n\nThe supporting body of the VWI is an association that had been formed in the founding phase of the VWI by the Jewish Community Vienna, the Jewish Documentation Center (Dokumentationszentrum des Bundes Jüdischer Verfolgter des Naziregimes), the Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance (Dokumentationsarchiv des österreichischen Widerstandes DÖW), the Institute of Contemporary History at the University of Vienna (Institut für Zeitgeschichte der Universität Wien), the Institute of Conflict Research (Institut für Konfliktforschung), the Jewish Museum Vienna and the International Research Centre for Cultural Studies (Internationales Forschungszentrum Kulturwissenschaften, IFK). Following a dispute on the permission for use of the archive of the Jewish Community Vienna, the Institute of Conflict Research and the IFK left the supporting body in November 2009, their representatives also resigning from their posts in the VWI board of directors.\n\nAfter the settlement of this dispute, a lending agreement on the use of the Holocaust-relevant materials in the IKG archive – as envisaged by the original board of directors – was signed by the new board of directors in November 2009. Subsequently, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and the Centre for Jewish Cultural History at the University of Salzburg (Zentrum für jüdische Kulturgeschichte, Universität Salzburg) joined the supporting body of the VWI in the beginning of 2010. The development of the institute and preparation for full operation was continued on the basis of the step-by-step plan as agreed on in the founding phase. With the arrival of the first fellows in autumn 2012 the institute started its all-out operation.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the VWI is appointed by the members of the supporting body. This holds the highest decision-making power in all organisational aspects of the VWI.\n\nAnton Pelinka was the first Chairman of the Board, the historian and philosopher Ingo Zechner VWI's first Managing Director. In November 2009, after a dispute on the proper usage of the archives of the IKG (intended to become a part of the holdings of the VWI), several members of the Board and the Managing Director resigned. Under the new Chairman of the Board, the professor of law at the University of Salzburg, Georg Graf, is deputies being Brigitte Bailer-Galanda and Ariel Muzicant this conflict – well documented in the Austrian media - finally was settled, and a contract on the usage of the archives already worked out by the former Board in accordance with the IKG was signed.\n\nIn January 2010, the Viennese contemporary historian Béla Rásky became VWI's new Managing Director. As of October 2012, sociologist Éva Kovács from the Centre of Social Studies at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences became the institute's Research Programme Director.\n\nThe International Academic Board is a key actor in all academic issues. The board consists of at least nine, maximum twelve internationally renowned experts, of whom no more than three are allowed to be from within Austrian academic institutions. Particular care is taken that the board remains interdisciplinary. Members and employees of members of the supporting body of the VWI cannot join the International Academic Board. The International Academic Board is elected for a period of three years at the general assembly, like the board.\n\nAs of January 2018, the members of the board are as follows (in alphabetical order):\n\n\nThe activities of the VWI fall into the three categories research, documentation and education. Within these categories, the institute addresses all issues related to antisemitism, racism and the Holocaust, including its emergence and aftermath.\n\nResearch is to be international and interdisciplinary at the VWI. It takes one of two forms: on the one hand, there is an annually announced fellowship program for Senior, Research and Senior Fellows, while on the other hand research projects of varying length will be conducted. Various research projects on the history of antisemitism and the Holocaust have been already worked out by the Research Programme Director, the Managing Director and the staff members of the institute (with the support of the Academic Advisory Board), are already filed for application.\n\nSince November 2010, VWI is a member in the consortium for the EU project European Holocaust Research Infrastructure – EHRI which entered in its second phase – EHRI-2 – in the end of 2014.\n\nThe aim of the documentation project of the VWI is to unite thematically relevant but hitherto separated archival materials, ensure their safekeeping and make them accessible to search tools. A first step in this direction has been taken in the form of cooperation in producing the online platform ns-quellen.at which had been commissioned to the \"Research Office. Association for Academic and Cultural Services\" (Forschungsbüro. Verein für wissenschaftliche und kulturelle Dienstleistungen) and was completed in March 2011. Digitalization of the Holocaust-relevant parts of the IKG archive began in September 2010 with work on the so-called Jerusalem materials of the archive. This work is conducted using the archival software \"scopeArchiv\", which is in widespread use in Austria. The scholarly library of the VWI of the VWI is currently numbering approx. 14,000 volumes so far, concentrating to some extent on books on Holocaust-Studies which are not accessible in Austria. The institute library is a public reference library. The library catalogue can be searched via the Austrian joint library system (OBV).\n\nSince the autumn of 2012, the institute hosts two senior, two research and four junior fellows a year. In general, the call for proposals is announced at the end of a calendar year. Decision on grants is made by a sub-commission of the Academic Advisory Board and a research staff member of the VWI in the spring of each year.\n\nIn the autumn of 2014, the e-Journal of the institute – S:I.M.O.N. - Shoah: Intervention. Methods. DocumentatiON. - went online, publishing the peer-reviewed manuscripts of the Simon Wiesenthal Lectures, the Working Papers of the fellows and articles selected by the Editorial Committee. VWI's book series is edited by the Viennese publishing house new academic press.\n\nThe institute's German-speaking, annual newsletter VWI im Fokus informs on all upcoming events and activities.\n\nTo achieve its aims of education, the VWI organises events such as book presentations, media and/or arts interventions in the public space in remembrance of the Shoah. An exhibition centre and an online platform are planned for when the institute has taken up full operation.\n\nThe \"Simon Wiesenthal Lectures\" which have by now grown into a VWI trademark event, aim to bring current Holocaust research to a wider public with the help of renowned international researchers. They take place approx. every two months in the roof-top foyer of the Austrian State Archives at the Minoritenplatz in Vienna.\n\nAt the end of a calendar year, VWI organises its annual \"Simon Wiesenthal Conference\": In 2011, the conference's topic was \"Scores of Commemoration. The Holocaust in Music\", while in 2012, \". Early Confrontations of the Mass Murder of the Jews\". In 2013, VWI - together with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum - hosted the Simon Wiesenthal Conference under the title \"Collaboration in Eastern Europe during World War II and the Holocaust\".\n\n"}

Most strictly, the term \"yakusha-e\" refers solely to portraits of individual artists (or sometimes pairs, as seen in this work by Sharaku). However, prints of kabuki scenes and of other elements of the world of the theater are very closely related, and were more often than not produced and sold alongside portraits.\n\n\"Ukiyo-e\" images were almost exclusively images of urban life; the vast majority that were not landscapes were devoted to depicting courtesans, sumo, or kabuki.\n\nRealistic detail, inscriptions, the availability of playbills from the period, and a number of other resources have allowed many prints to be analyzed and identified in great detail. Scholars have been able to identify the subjects of many prints down to not only the play, roles, and actors portrayed, but often the theater, year, month, and even day of the month as well.\n\nOver the course of the Edo period, as \"ukiyo-e\" as a whole developed and changed as a genre, \"yakusha-e\" went through a number of changes as well. Many prints, particularly earlier ones, depict actors generically, and very plainly, showing in a sense their true natures as actors merely playing at roles. Many other prints, meanwhile, take something of the opposite tack; they show kabuki actors and scenes very elaborately, intentionally obscuring the distinction between a play and the actual events it seeks to evoke.\n\nOnly a few artists were innovative enough to stand apart from the masses, creating works more distinctive in style. These artists, beginning with Katsukawa Shunshō, depicted actors elaborately and idealistically, but with the realistic details of individualized faces. Individual actors, such as Ichikawa Danjūrō V, can now be recognized across roles and even as depicted by different artists.\n\nTorii Kiyonobu (1664–1729) was likely one of the first to produce actor prints in the mainstream \"ukiyo-e\" style. An artist from the Torii school which painted theater signboards, Kiyonobu was no stranger to the theater or to artistic depictions of it. In 1700, he published a book of full-length portraits of Edo kabuki actors in various roles. Though he took much, stylistically, from the Torii school style as a whole, there are significant elements of his style that were innovative and new. His dramatic forms would guide the core of \"ukiyo-e\" style for the next eighty years. It is possible that his prints may have even affected kabuki itself, as actors sought to match their performances to the dramatic, bombastic, and intense poses of the art.\n\nBy the 1740s, artists such as Torii Kiyotada were making prints depicting not only the actors themselves, in portraits or in stage scenes, but the theaters themselves, including the audience, architecture, and various staging elements.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, many \"ukiyo-e\" artists produced actor prints and other depictions of the kabuki world. Most of these drew strongly upon the Torii style, and were essentially promotional works, \"generalized, highly stylized billboards meant to attract the crowd with their bold line and color\". It was not until the 1760s and the emergence of Katsukawa Shunshō that actors began to be portrayed in such a way that the individual actors could be identified across different prints depicting different roles. Shunshō focused on facial features and idiosyncrasies of the individual actors.\n\nThis drastic change in style was emulated by Shunshō's students of the Katsukawa school, and by many other ukiyo-e artists of the period. The realistic, individualized style replaced that of the Torii school's idealistic, dramatic, but ultimately generalized style which had dominated for seventy years.\n\nSharaku is one of the most famous and influential \"yakusha-e\" printers along with Kiyonobu; working roughly a century after Kiyonobu, the two are often said to represent the beginnings and peak of kabuki depictions in prints. Sharaku's works are very bold and energetic, and demonstrate an unmistakably unique style. His portraits are easily among the most individualized and distinctive portrayals in all of ukiyo-e. However, his personal style was not emulated by other artists, and can be seen only in the works created by Sharaku himself, during the incredibly short period in which he produced prints, between 1794 and 1795.\n\nMeanwhile, Utagawa Toyokuni emerged almost simultaneously with Sharaku. His most well-known actor prints were published in 1794–1796, in a collection called \"Yakusha butai no sugata-e\" (役者舞台の姿絵, \"Views of Actors on Stage\"). Though his works lack the unique energy of Sharaku's, he is considered one of the greatest artists in \"large-head\" portraits, and in ukiyo-e in general for his depictions of other subjects and in other formats. Though the figure print began to enter serious decline around the turn of the 19th century, headshot portraits continued to be produced. Artists of the Utagawa school, emulating Toyokuni's style, created highly characterized depictions of artists that, while not particularly realistic, were nevertheless highly individualized. The characters and, perhaps, actual appearances of a great number of individual actors, who would otherwise be known only by their names, are thus known to modern scholarship.\n\nThe sentiments of the above paragraph notwithstanding, there appeared a 開花年齢 [A Flowering Age] of 役者絵 (c.1860-75), when actors’ names could again be printed alongside their image, even if any scenic background was added by other artists (which was normally acknowledged), and, more importantly, date identifications were ascribed by means of singe Censor Seal. There prints, of Kabuki virtuosi, were abundant, numbering more than the usual press runs, they included images of, for example: young 一 代目河原崎権十郎 [Kawarazaki Gonjuro I ]; the newly-renamed 四代目中村芝 [Nakamura Shikan IV]; the aging 四代目市川小團 次 [Ichikawa Kodanji IV]; and the 15-year-old, virtuoso 女形 [onnagata; ladies’ roles] 三代目 沢村田之助 [Sawamara Tanosuke III]. This blossoming of 役者絵 -- they truly are portraits, not merely good caricatures -- advertised plays in the season; new presentations of any said play, which could number many in a season, replete with new costumes (contemporary reports claimed that costumes only lasted some weeks in performance), or were presented \"gratis\" as souvenirs of any presentation. All were eagerly awaited by an insatiably acquisitive, theater-going public. See the description of the print here by clicking on the image. \n\n\n\n"}
