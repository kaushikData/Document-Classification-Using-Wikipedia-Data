He left Turkey in 1923 when the Kemalists declared a new republic. In 1927, at a conference of Kurdish nationalists held in Beirut, a committee was formed, the Xoybûn. He is known for having been the first modern linguist to compile and organise the grammar of the modern form of the Northern Kurdish language, Kurmanji, and having designed the Latin-based Hawar alphabet, which is now the formal alphabet of Kurmanji and is also frequently used for the other dialects of the Kurdish Language, having replaced the Arabic-based, Cyrillic-based, Persian-based and Armenian-based alphabets formerly used for Kurmanji.\n\nCeladet was born to Mir Ali Bedir Khan, son of the last emir of the Bohtan Bedir Khan Beg, and Circassian Senihe Hanım. Sources differ as to his birthplace: according to Kurdish sources he was born in a suburb of Istanbul, Turkey; however, according to Encyclopædia Britannica, he was born in Syria. He held a master's degree in law from Istanbul University, completed his studies in Munich, and spoke several foreign languages including Arabic, Kurdish, Russian, German, Turkish, Persian and French.\n\nIn 1919, Celadet and his brother Kamuran Ali Bedirxan accompanied British officer Edward Noel in his travels through Iraq. Noel was assessing the possibility of the creation of an official nation of Kurdistan.\nAli Badirkhan left Turkey for Egypt in 1923 when the Ankara Government declared the new republic. In 1927, at a conference of Kurdish nationalists held in Beirut, a committee was formed, the Xoybûn, to coordinate the movement. Jaladat Ali Badirkhan was elected as the first president of this committee. Three years later, the Xoybûn became involved in the Kurdish independence movement in Ağrı Province, called Republic of Ararat. After the defeat of the Ararat movement, he moved to Iran. Reza Shah Pahlavi, King of Iran, tried to persuade him to stay away from Kurdish nationalist movement, and offered him a consulate job, but had him expelled from the country when he did not agree. Then he moved to Iraq, but the British did not want him to stay, and he finally moved to Syria in 1931, where he lived his remaining two decades in exile.\n\nAfter the defeat of Kurdish nationalist movements in Turkey, Iraq and Iran, he devoted himself to the Kurdish cultural issues. In 1935 he married his cousin, Rewşen Xanim. He had two children from this marriage, Cemşîd and Sînemxan. During his last years, he faced severe economic problems, and worked as a farmer. In July 1951, he fell into a well during an incident and died.\n\nHis daughter Sînemxan, lives in Baghdad; she has written several books on Kurdistan's history.\n\nHis work in exile concentrated on a Latin alphabet for the Kurdish language. In 1931, he published the Kurdish grammar book \"Bingehên rêzimana Kurdî\" (or \"Bingehên gramera kurdmancî\"). The French authorities in Syria permitted his publishing of a Kurdish-oriented cultural magazine, \"Hawar\", beginning on 15 May 1932. It was initially bi-monthly, and primarily in Kurdish, with three or four pages per issue in French. Although the first 23 issues, from 1932 to 1935, were published using the Arabic alphabet, his principal purpose was the further development and spread of the Latin-based alphabet he had developed for northern Kurdish (i.e., Kurmanji), and issues 24 to 57, from 1941 to 1943 (monthly), were published in the standard Latin-based Kurdish alphabet, also known as the \"Bedirxan script\". It is still used by Kurds in Turkey and Syria. And it is still used for Zazaki and Kurmanji and partly Sorani in Kurdistan Regional Government. From 1942 until 1945, he published a separate monthly journal named \"Ronahî\", comprising 28 issues. In 1970, the French translation of his book on Kurdish grammar was published in France.\n\n\n"}

She was a descendant of Bilali Muhammad, an enslaved person and a Muslim from West Africa who worked on Thomas Spalding's plantation.\n\nBailey grew up in the settlement of Belle Marsh on Sapelo Island, one of many communities that traced their heritage back to freed slaves who purchased land on the isolated island.\n\nBailey left Sapelo Island briefly to live with family on St. Simons Island, then settled in Hog Hammock on her return to the island in 1966. Bailey ran a guest house there, The Wallow Lodge, with her husband Julius Bailey and their seven children.\n\nShe took pride in her heritage, which she described specifically as Saltwater Geechee. She worked to preserve and document Geechee-Gullah stories and ways of life in the face of a dwindling population and increasing real estate development – a trend bringing wealthy white people to build large vacation homes on the historically black island. She taught crafts she herself had learned from her father: basket weaving, cast net knitting, herb collecting, and midwifery. She was known locally as a griot, a storyteller and unofficial historian of Sapelo Island.\n\nBailey traveled to Sierra Leone in 1989, where she investigated the links between Sapelo Island and West African traditions. She noted similar forms of vernacular architecture, as well as similar agricultural techniques and cooking styles.\n\nBailey served as vice president of the Sapelo Island Cultural and Revitalization Society, which she co-founded in 1993 with Inez Grovner. They began organizing Sapelo Island Cultural Days, held annually in October, which aimed to bring in tourists and generate income to help preserve the community.\n\nHer first book, the memoir \"God, Dr. Buzzard, and the Bolito Man: A Saltwater Geechee Talks About Life on Sapelo Island, Georgia,\" was written with Christena Bledsoe and published in 2000. The book collects stories about her own childhood, as well as tales about her ancestors and the history of Sapelo Island.\n\nBailey was one of the authors, with Ray Crook, Norma Harris, and Karen Smith, of \"Sapelo Voices: Historical Anthropology and the Oral Traditions of Gullah-Geechee Communities on Sapelo Island, Georgia\", published in 2003 by The State University of West Georgia. In the book, which collects oral history interviews that were conducted in 1992, she asks questions of the island's elders and joins them in reminiscences of the ways of the past.\n\nBailey worked with cuisine revivalists to bring Purple Ribbon sugarcane, a strain close to extinction, to Sapelo Island. They planted it on her farm in Hog Hammock as well as at Dr. Bill Thomas and Jerome Dixon's Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms in nearby Shellman Bluff. Its first yield – 50 gallons of Sapelo Purple Ribbon Sugarcane Syrup – was harvested just after her death in late 2017.\n\nBailey and her family worked with Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms to cultivate Sapelo Red Peas, Sapelo's first commercial crop, and brought their first harvest to market in 2014. She had a wide network of academics, scientists, and chefs who supported her work with farming and food, including food historian David Shields, geneticist Stephen Kresovich, chef Linton Hopkins, and chef Sean Brock.\n\nIn 2004, she received a Governor's Award in the Humanities for her cultural preservation work.

The name is anachronistic, and no Banu Qasi is attested until Mutarrif ibn-Musa during the 780s, but he is identified with just his father's name and not explicitly linked to Cassius or the Banu Qasi. Historians point out that the origins of the Banu Qasi, as recounted by Ibn al-Qutiyya, could be a product of the spurious antiquarianism of the later Umayyad period rather than reliable genealogy, satisfying the need for stories which bridged the conquest. \n\nAccording to the tenth century Gothic Muwallad historian Ibn al-Qūṭiyya, Count Cassius converted to Islam in 714, shortly after the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, as a client (\"mawali\") of the Umayyads; his family came to be called the \"Banu Qasi\" (, the \"sons [or descendants] of Cassius\"). Cassius had converted at the hands of the Arab, Hassan ibn Yassar al-Hudhali, qadi in Zaragoza at the time of Abd ar-Rahman's arrival in the peninsula, as a means to preserve his lands and political power. Cassius joined forces with Musa ibn Nusayr and Tariq ibn Ziyad, and is reported to have travelled to Damascus to personally swear allegiance to the Caliph Al-Walid I. \n\nThe eleventh century Arab historian Ibn Hazm attributed five sons to Cassius: Fortun, Abu Tawr, Abu Salama, Yunus, and Yahya. The Banu Qasi dynasty descended from Fortun, the eldest son; the second son may have been the Abu Taur of Huesca who invited Charlemagne to Zaragoza in 778; and the \"Banu Salama\", a family that ruled Huesca and Barbitanya (Barbastro) in the late tenth century, may have descended from Abu Salama.\n\nAt the time of the Muslim arrival and after, Cassius ruled an area comprising Tudela, Tarazona, Borja, and, probably, Ejea.\n\n\n"}

This assembly approved the \"Constitution of Havana\" on 30 September and 1 and 2 October 1928, as their project of giving a Provisional Constitution for a Catalan Republic.\n\nThe Draft Constitution was written by Josep Conangla i Fontanilles (Montblanc 1875 – Havana 1965), a Catalan essayist and poet living in Havana, and the leading Catalan separatist in the Americas during the 20th Century.\n\nIn 1931 the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, but the lack of a strong leader and mature separatist party extinguished the aspirations to independence embodied in this text. Therefore, the constitution never came into effect, and instead the Catalan authorities presented the Draft Statute of Catalonia of 1932 to the Spanish Government.

Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, the poet and author Sir John Betjeman, Sir John Summerson, Robert Byron, the architect Sir Albert Richardson, Oliver Messel, and Sir Osbert Sitwell were among its most prominent early active members. Since 1971, the Georgian Group has been a national amenity society. \n\nThe Georgian Group acts as a statutory consultee in the planning process in England and Wales, when consideration is being given to proposals to alter or demolish listed buildings dating, in whole or in part, from between 1700 and 1837. The Victorian Society plays a similar role for buildings built between 1837 and 1914. It is notified of many thousands of applications each year. (In Scotland the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland, formerly the Georgian Group of Edinburgh, is now the relevant statutory consultee). \n\nThe Group has a similar role in the Church of England and Church in Wales faculty systems, and also advises the internal planning bodies of the Methodist, Roman Catholic, Baptist and United Reformed Church, on alterations to listed churches and chapels, including on the re-ordering or removal of historic fixtures and fittings.\n\nIn 2002 the Georgian Group introduced its annual awards which are aimed at recognizing exemplary conservation and restoration projects in the United Kingdom. An award is also given for high quality new buildings in a Georgian context. \n\nIts present headquarters is at 6 Fitzroy Square, London W1, a large Robert Adam town house which it has restored. Its extensive library and an important collection of architectural watercolours and engravings, the Pardoe Collection, are housed within its headquarters and are available for public examination by appointment. \n\nSince the early 1980s the Georgian Group has employed specialist regional caseworkers to undertake its advisory work within the planning process. Any member of the public can ask the Group for assistance in preventing the destruction of a Georgian building, although the Group's resources are limited. There are four casework regions: London and the South East, Central and Northern England, South West England and the Cotswolds, and Wales. The caseworkers are responsible to a Senior Caseworker and a committee of expert advisers. Recent senior caseworkers have included Clare Campbell MA, Andrew Martindale BA, and John Neale MA IHBC.

From 1928 to 1932 he was a student scholarship holder at University College Galway, graduating in 1932 with a Bachelor of Commerce, and a Bachelor of Arts, with first-class honours in both, and a specialisation in \"History, Ethics, Politics\" for the latter. Mary Donovan O'Sullivan was one of his professors of history, and Liam Ó Briain, professor of Romance languages, was a stimulating influence. At this time Hayes-McCoy was a member of the Republican Club, a committee member of the Literary and Debating Society, and in 1931 he was one of the founding members of a new Irish Students' Association.\n\nHayes-McCoy pursued his PhD at the University of Edinburgh (conferred July 1934), and then spent two years at the Institute of Historical Research, London, in the Tudor seminar of J.E.Neale, rewriting his PhD and eventually publishing it as Scots mercenary forces in Ireland, 1565–1603 (Dublin and London, 1937), with a foreword by Eoin MacNeill. This was characterised by meticulous archival research, and it anticipated by sixty years the much vaunted New British History of the late twentieth century by tracing the interconnections between events in England, Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nIn the absence of an academic post, Hayes-McCoy became an assistant keeper in the Art and Industrial Division at the National Museum of Ireland (1939–1959), with a responsibility for the Military History, and the [Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]] collections. One of his first tasks was to prepare a standing exhibition on Irish history before 1916. His research, long-standing personal interest in the military, and his curatorial experience, helped form an expert knowledge of historical Irish warfare. This led to his role in co-founding The Military History Society of Ireland in 1949 whose journal \"The Irish Sword\" he edited (1949–1959). Hayes-McCoy described the vagaries of setting up such a body, its reception, and the historiographical considerations attendant on it, in a paper published posthumously in \"The Irish Sword\".\n\nOn 19 August 1941 Hayes-McCoy had married Mary Margaret \"May\" O'Connor (daughter of C.J. and M.B. O'Connor, New Ross/Enniscorthy). They had three daughters and two sons (Mary, Ann, Ian, Robert, Felicity). The family home was in Dublin. \n\nEarning high reputation by continued research and by publishing led to Hayes-McCoy's receipt of the D.Litt. degree from the National University, and to his membership in the Royal Irish Academy (1950). In his professional career, he published prolifically (this is apart from the broad spectrum of press publications) – a comprehensive list was made by Harman Murtagh. The works that were judged most influential, were his Scots mercenary forces in Ireland 1565–1603 (1937) (\"a pioneer study in Scots-Irish relations\"), the papers \"The early history of guns in Ireland\" (1938–1939), \"Strategy and tactics in Irish warfare, 1593–1601\" (1941), \"The army of Ulster, 1593–1601\" (1951), the controversial \"Gaelic society in Ireland in the late sixteenth century\" (1963), and the monographs Irish battles (London 1969), and A history of Irish flags from earliest times (Dublin 1979). A member of the Irish Manuscripts Commission, his most notable contribution was the publication Ulster and other Irish maps, c.1600 (Dublin 1964).\n\nIn 1946, he was appointed to a committee of eight historians to advise on setting up the Bureau of Military History – a body established for the creation and compilation of material on the history of the Irish movements for independence, 1913–1921, specifically from witness statements. The committee was also to further offer guidance and oversee progress of the Bureau in co ordination with the Ministry of Defence.\n\nHaving begun writing for the press at an early stage, G.A.Hayes-McCoy's public position at the Museum encouraged him to go further. He had broad involvement with local history groups to whom he presented papers, and also worked for newspapers and for radio and television. To the national and Galway press he usually contributed articles on military aspects of Irish history, as well as book reviews, but he also used them as a platform to engage with what he saw were flaws in the education of history in Ireland which during his lifetime was constrained by a certain degree of political and cultural state control.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Hayes-McCoy became involved in a number of paratheatrical events of national significance one of which – the \"Pageant of St.Patrick\" for which he wrote the script (An Tóstal 1954) – was realised on an immense scale. He scripted these works to begin with(1947, 1953, 1954), and was later principally engaged as historical consultant (1947, 1955, 1956, [1957]). In that capacity, he collaborated in 1955 and 1956 with Micheál Mac Liammóir and Denis Johnston on their scripts for pageants on St.Patrick and on the Táin Bó Cuailgne, at times finding it difficult to square the historical liberties taken by these artists with his own role. \n\nOn Irish radio and television Hayes-McCoy was most active in the mid-1960s; editing and contributing to Thomas Davis lectures series, writing scripts for a series of thirty children's programmes on all aspects of Irish history, and preparing the television series \"Irish battles\" and \"The long winter\". As well as writing for RTÉ, Ireland's national broadcaster, he contributed scripts to BBC N Ireland's schools radio programmes.\n\nIn 1959 Hayes-McCoy succeeded to the chair of his former history professor at UCG with the full remit of lecturing (in English), administering examinations to undergraduates, and supervising postgraduate theses – among those of his students who continued in the field of history were Nicholas Canny, Martin Coen, Patrick Melvin, Peter Toner, Tony Claffey, and Breandán Ó Bric. After his appointment to UCG, the family home remained in Dublin and Hayes-McCoy commuted to Galway weekly during term time.\n\nIn the early 1960s Hayes-McCoy became a spokesperson for the movement rekindled by the Old Galway Society to preserve the landmark \"Lion's Tower\" in that city. The ultimate failure of the campaign informed Hayes-McCoy's regret, expressed a year later, that Ireland was forgetful about its past and that \"we don't bother to find out about it or to maintain our ancient heritage\", and, on a perceived spirit of conformity: \"take my own city of Galway, it is now more prosperous than it was, but it is no longer distinctive. I do not believe that it is essential for progress that we should lose our heritage\" \n\nWhile at one time member and secretary of the London Sinn Féin office (Roger Casement Cumann, 1935), and informed by a pride of country and place, Hayes-McCoy's professional and private outlook were marked by a distrust of nationalism or of any antagonising national agendas compromising genuine scholarship. In a paper drafted on tendencies in modern historical studies, he criticised the two historiographical extremes, each to be avoided, each unfortunately characteristic of the moment – extreme de-bunking and extreme 'adding for effect'. 'A history is a record of fact; to add pseudo-facts is as grave a sin as to leave out real facts that may change the colour of the whole'.\n\nHayes-McCoy's abiding pastime was drawing. Among his papers in the James Hardiman Library, NUI Galway are c. 40 items with predominantly maritime subjects, and he had a special regard for the history of ships, and a romantic liking of the sea. He also had a lifelong interest in Robert Louis Stevenson, Sir Walter Scott, and their works, and in the Pre-Raphaelite movement. \n\nG.A.Hayes-McCoy's middle age was marked by intermittent ill health. He died on 27 November 1975 in his room at the Great Southern Hotel, Eyre Square, Galway.\n\nHayes-McCoy's papers are held at the James Hardiman Library, National University of Ireland, Galway.

{"id": "12904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12904", "title": "Glyph", "text": "Glyph\n\nIn typography, a glyph is an elemental symbol within an agreed set of symbols, intended to represent a readable character for the purposes of writing. Glyphs are considered to be unique marks that collectively add up to the spelling of a word or contribute to a specific meaning of what is written, with that meaning dependent on cultural and social usage. \n\nIn contrast, in most languages written in any variety of the Latin alphabet, the dot on a lower-case \"i\" is not a glyph because it does not convey any distinction, and an \"i\" in which the dot has been accidentally omitted is still likely to be recognized correctly. However, in Turkish it is a glyph because that language has two distinct versions of the letter \"i\", with and without a dot. Also, in Japanese syllabaries, a number of the characters are made up of more than one separate mark, but in general these separate marks are not glyphs because they have no meaning by themselves. However, in some cases, additional marks fulfill the role of diacritics, to differentiate distinct characters. Such additional marks constitute glyphs. In general, a diacritic is a glyph, even if it is contiguous with the rest of the character like a cedilla in French, the ogonek in several languages, or the stroke on a Polish \"Ł\".\n\nSome characters such as \"æ\" in Icelandic and the \"ß\" in German may be regarded as glyphs, yet they were originally ligatures, but over time have become characters in their own right, and these languages treat them as separate letters. However, a ligature such as \"ſi\", that is treated in some typefaces as a single unit, is arguably not a glyph as this is just a quirk of the typeface, essentially an allographic feature, and includes more than one grapheme. In normal handwriting, even long words are often written \"joined up\", without the pen leaving the paper, and the form of each written letter will often vary depending on which letters precede and follow it, but that does not make the whole word into a single glyph.\n\nTwo or more glyphs which have the same significance, whether used interchangeably or chosen depending on context, are called allographs of each other.\n\nThe term has been used in English since 1727, borrowed from \"glyphe\" (in use by French antiquaries since 1701), from the Greek γλυφή, \"glyphē\", \"carving,\" and the verb γλύφειν, \"glýphein\", \"to hollow out, engrave, carve\" (cognate with Latin \"glubere\" \"to peel\" and English \"cleave\").\n\nThe word \"hieroglyph\" (Greek for sacred writing) has a longer history in English, dating from an early use in an English to Italian dictionary published by John Florio in 1598, referencing the complex and mysterious characters of the Egyptian alphabet.\nThe word \"glyph\" first came to widespread European attention with the engravings and lithographs from Frederick Catherwood's drawings of undeciphered glyphs of the Maya civilization in the early 1840s. \n\nIn graphonomics, the term glyph is used for a noncharacter, i.e. either a subcharacter or multicharacter pattern. Most typographic glyphs originate from the characters of a typeface. In a typeface each character typically corresponds to a single glyph, but there are exceptions, such as a font used for a language with a large alphabet or complex writing system, where one character may correspond to several glyphs, or several characters to one glyph.\n\nIn archaeology, a glyph is a carved or inscribed symbol. It may be a pictogram or ideogram, or part of a writing system such as a syllable, or a logogram.\n\nA glyph is \"the specific shape, design, or representation of a character\". It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface, of an element of written language, which could be a grapheme, or part of a grapheme, or sometimes several graphemes in combination (a composed glyph). If there is more than one allograph of a unit of writing, and the choice between them depends on context or on the preference of the author, they now have to be treated as separate glyphs, because mechanical arrangements have to be available to differentiate between them and to print whichever of them is required. The same is true in computing. In computing as well as typography, the term \"character\" refers to a grapheme or grapheme-like unit of text, as found in natural language writing systems (\"scripts\"). In typography and computing, the range of graphemes is broader than in a written language in other ways too: a typographical font often has to cope with a range of different languages each of which contribute their own graphemes, and it may also be required to print other symbols such as dingbats. The range of glyphs required increases correspondingly. In summary, in typography and computing, a glyph is a graphical unit.\n\n\n"}

She studied Education and History at Cambridge University and in 1973, during her third year there, she met her future husband, Anthony John Clark, a scientist from Lincolnshire, who later became director of the Roslin Institute and was awarded an OBE. With John she has two children Charlie (born 1989) and Laurie (born 1991). After John's death in 2004 she married Jim Kendall in 2011. Helen died on 14 August 2015 after a two-year illness with Motor Neurone Disease. She created a blog to chart her progress and share its effects with others.\n\nHelen moved to Edinburgh in 1977 where she volunteered at the National Museum before getting her first job as an Art Assistant at the Royal Scottish Museum, now the National Museum of Scotland. In 1982, she became Assistant Keeper of Social History at Beamish North of England Open Air Museum in County Durham, where she first began getting involved in recording oral history.\n\nHelen returned to Edinburgh to become the Keeper of Social History at Edinburgh City Museums from 1985 to 2005; then Special Projects Manager until her retirement in 2012. She shared the task of setting up a new social history museum, the People's Story Museum, which opened in 1989 and \"explores the lives of Edinburgh's ordinary people at work and play from the late 18th century to today\", using oral testimony and first hand experience.\n\nIn 2009 Helen prepared the Votes for Women exhibition at the Museum of Edinburgh as part of Gude Cause. In the same year she became a member of the Gude Cause New Media Group (renamed Gude Cause Project) to develop links to a digital record of films, recordings and photographs made of activities organised nationally, leading up to the Gude Cause procession in Edinburgh.\n\nIn 2014 Helen was interviewed for the WEA Scotland Breaking the Mould project which was researching material for a publication relating to women and women's groups, with connections to Edinburgh, involved in Social and Political Activism in the 100 years after the beginning of WWI. The publication, \"Breaking the Mould: Edinburgh\", includes a tribute to Helen who died just as it was going to the printers. \n\nFor many years Helen was a member of the DRBs Scottish Women's History Group and of Protest in Harmony, an Edinburgh-based radical singing group.\n\nThe opening of the People's Story Museum coincided with the publication of Helen's first book, \"Sing a Rebel Song: The Story of James Connolly\". Her second book, \"Raise the Banners High\", was published in 1999 and illustrates and examines the wide range of Trade Union banners held by Edinburgh Museums. These banners and flags were carried by Edinburgh workers as symbols of their causes whether in celebration or to campaign against a working practice or injustice. Her third book, written with Elizabeth Carnegie, \"She Was Aye Workin\"' \"– Memories of Tenement Women in Edinburgh and Glasgow\", published in 2002 used oral history sources to give \"a vivid picture of tough, resilient women, and communities\".\n"}
{"id": "51282178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51282178", "title": "Helga Adler", "text": "Helga Adler\n\nHelga Adler (born Helga Obuchoff: 21 December 1943) spent the earlier part of her career as an East German historian and, latterly, politician. She was politically engaged during the build up to German reunification, but in November 1991 resigned, sidelined and disillusioned, from what had by then become the Party of Democratic Socialism, Since then she been formally unaffiliated politically, but very far from uninterested.\n\nShe has been a committed feminist through most of her career, and was the director of the Paula Panke Women's Centre (\"Frauenzentrum Paula Panke e.V.\") in Berlin-Pankow between 1998 and 2009.\n\nHelga Obuchoff was born in Praschnitz a mid-sized town in the Zichenau region of what had become East Prussia following the frontier changes agreed and implemented by the governments of Germany and the Soviet Union four years earlier, in 1939. Her father had volunteered for army service in 1939, and was promoted by the end of the war to the rank of a junior officer. After the ethnic cleansing of 1944/45 the Obuchoffs and their three children ended up living with relatives in the Harz region, before moving on and settling in Genthin, a small industrial town near Magdeburg, where Helga Obuchoff grew up. The entire central portion of what had been Germany was administered as the Soviet occupation zone after 1945, and her father engaged in the politics of the time and place, becoming by 1956 the first secretary in the Genthin district of the Socialist Unity Party (\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\" / SED), created in 1946 and, after October 1949, the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. As a young mother in a war-ravaged country with a desperate shortage of working age males, Obuchoff's mother was able to benefit from education and other practical career support that would not have been available to German women of earlier generations, and later became the Operations Manager at Genthin's large sugar refinery.\n\nBy the time she was old enough to attend secondary school, the education system had been reconfigured. Between 1950 and 1958 Obuchoff attended the Polytechnic Secondary School (\"Polytechnische Oberschule\" / POS) in Wernigerode and then, when the family relocated, moved on to the POS in Genthin. Between 1958 and 1962 she attended Genthin's well respected Extended Secondary School (\"Erweiterte allgemeinbildende polytechnische Oberschule\" / EOS) which was where, in 1962, she passed her School Final Exams (Abitur), opening the way to university level education. However, her immediate next step, in 1962/63, was a training in Magdeburg as a draftswoman for the construction sector. \n\nIt was only to be expected that, as the daughter of a dedicated party official, Helga Obuchoff had been a member of the party's youth wing, the Free German Youth (\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\" / FDJ) since 1958: in 1963 she became one of the by now one and a half million members of the country's ruling SED (party). In 1963 she enrolled at Berlin's Humboldt University where she studied History and Art history, concluding her undergraduate studies in 1968 with a history degree. After this she worked between 1968 and 1974 as a researcher at the Party Central Committee's in Berlin, holding a teaching chair in history. From 1974 to 1975, and again between 1978 and 1990, she held a post as a researcher at the in East Berlin. Between 1975 and 1978 she combined her roles in Berlin with her work as a researcher at the International Peace Institute (\"Internationales Institut für Frieden\") in Vienna, where the focus of her work was on the peace movement. However, in 1979 it was from the in Berlin that she received her doctorate for work on socialist and democratic movements and the peace movement in Western Europe and the USA (\"...soziale und demokratische Bewegungen sowie über die Friedensbewegung in Westeuropa und den USA \"), subjects on which as an established researcher at the Institute she was also able to act as an advisor to the political establishment. She was also able to apply herself to contemporary social movements in her study of the German Federal Republic (West Germany), such as the \"new political platforms in the struggle against nuclear power\" among which she identified students, women, gays and lesbians.\n\n1989 was a year of increasing street protests in East Germany, mirrored by a loss of self-confidence within the party leadership which reflected uncertainty over the extent to which any traditional hard-line government response to the protestors would be supported by Mikhail Gorbachev, whose advocacy of greater openness had actually encouraged political discussion in East Germany. Underlying the political tensions was the financial bankruptcy of the state which was forcing the government to solicit additional funding from West Germany. In June 1989 Adler was a member of an East German delegation headed up by Egon Krenz for an exploratory meeting with Oskar Lafontaine. The meeting was important because Krenz and LaFontaine were seen as potential future leaders of their countries at a time when Erich Honnecker was well past retirement age and Helmut Kohl had already been in power for eight years. LaFontaine occupied a position on the political left within (for most of the time) the West German political establishment, while there were hopes that Krenz might be more open to new ideas than the existing East German geruntocracy. At a time when few dared (or, from the position of the East Germany political establishment, wished) to contemplate reunification, good personal relations between LaFontaine and Krenz nevertheless offered the prospect of closer future relations between East and West Germany. Adler later recalled their meeting, at which LaFontaine had politely but firmly criticised the recent so-called Tiananmen Square Massacre and condemned the falsification of election results in East Germany. Krenz initially responded expansively and positively, but then appeared to withdraw his earlier comments after receiving fresh instructions from the leadership in Berlin.\n\nThe breach of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the subsequent realisation that Soviet troops in East Germany had no orders to intervene in order to suppress popular dissent, appeared to rule out a rerun in Berlin of the 1968 Prague Spring or of East Germany's own sad experiences back in 1953. This triggered a series of events which presaged political change and which, as matters turned out, culminated in German reunification, formally in October 1990. There were those who thought the survival of East Germany's ruling SED (party) in doubt. At the end of 1989 Helga Adler was one of those who took a lead in insisting that the old party could and must be reformed in order to preserve socialist values through an uncertain future, as part of which she took a lead in establishing what one source defines as the \"Initiative Movement\" (\"Initiativbewegung\") which was part of the process leading to the emergence of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which as the discredited authoritarianism of the German Democratic Republic crumbled, could evolve into something better able to operate under democratic structures. Between March 1990 and November 1991 Helga Adler served as a member of the PDS party executive (\"Parteivorstand\"). Within the leadership team, reflecting her years of academic research, she headed up the Commission on Foreign Policy, Pressure Groups and Labour Associations. In February and March 1991 Helga Adler also served as spokesperson for the party executive. Nevertheless, in November 1991 she resigned from all her party offices, also resigning her party membership. She complained of a monolithic approach by the new party leadership under Gregor Gysi, that left insufficient room for discussion, even though he was keen, for external consumption, to present the party as something colourful, diverse, feminine, punky and youthful (\"... als etwas Buntes, Vielfältiges, Weibliches, Punkiges, Junges\"). Several of the party's \"more progressive\" comrades resigned at the same time, apparently for broadly the same reasons.\n\nFrom December 1991 till the start of 1993 Adler worked as a researcher in \"Netzwerk Wissenschaft\" in Berlin. Between 1992 and 1999 she was a member of the executive board with the Marburg based , a left-leaning think tank / pressure group. In 1997 she accepted the directorship of the Paula Panke Women's Centre (\"Frauenzentrum Paula Panke e.V.\") in Berlin-Pankow, running the centre with energy and commitment till 2008 or 2009. She also, in 1999, became spokeswoman for the \"Berlin Women's Network\" (\"Berliner FrauenNetzwerk\").\n\nSince 2011 Adler has represented The Left (party) in the Berlin-Pankow local council, although formally she remains unaffiliated politically. \n"}

His ca. 1575 memoir, \"Memoria de las cosas y costa y indios de la Florida\", is one of the most valuable contemporary accounts of American Indian life from that period. The manuscript can be found in the General Archive of the Indies. In all, he produced five documents describing the peoples of native Florida.\n\nAround 1549, when Fontaneda was thirteen, he and his brother were sailing to Spain, to study in Salamanca, when their ship wrecked on the coast of Florida, possibly during a hurricane. The crew and passengers were rescued by the Calusa, who enslaved them and eventually sacrificed everyone besides Fontaneda; the boy apparently escaped death by correctly interpreting their commands to sing and dance for them. He spent the next seventeen years living among the Calusa and other tribes, learning several languages and travelling extensively through Florida. Around 1566 Fontaneda was rescued from his captivity by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, Florida's first Spanish governor and founder of St. Augustine, who bargained for his freedom from King Carlos. An alternate claim is that Fontaneda was rescued by the Huguenots of Fort Caroline in 1565, and reunited with the Spanish when they took over the fort. He served as an interpreter and guide for Menéndez on a number of missions for the next several years, and returned to Spain in 1569 to reclaim his parents' property from the Crown. In 1575 he wrote his memoir, which proved valuable to historians of the day such as Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, and remains so today.\n\nFontaneda provides the city of Tampa's earliest written mention. He names 22 important villages of the Calusa, the first being \"Tanpa\". He gives no details concerning the exact location of Tanpa, but archaeologist Jerald Milanich places the Calusa village of Tanpa at the mouth of Charlotte Harbor, the original \"Bay of Tanpa\". A later Spanish expedition did not notice Charlotte Harbor while sailing north along the west coast of Florida and assumed that the current Tampa Bay was the bay they sought. The name was accidentally transferred north.\n\nHis \"Memoir\" also proved instrumental in the development of the Fountain of Youth legend as an early mention of Juan Ponce de León looking for the healing waters in Florida, a detail almost inseparable from the myth today. Though Fontaneda did not believe the story, later historians were less incredulous.\n\n"}

He also was the author or editor of more than 50 books, including at least seven novels.\n\nDriggs was born in Pleasant Grove, Utah. His parents had come to Utah with the Mormon pioneers. Driggs studied at Brigham Young Academy, the University of Utah, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees, the University of Chicago, and New York University where he received his Ph.D. in 1926.\n\nDriggs first began teaching in a small school in Pleasant Grove just after graduating from Brigham Young Academy. He later was on the faculty of what is now Southern Utah University when it opened in 1897. From 1907 to 1923, he was a member of the University of Utah faculty, serving for part of that time as the principal of the university's teacher training school. From 1927 until his retirement in 1942 Driggs was an English professor at New York University. He made his home, for many decades, in Bayside, New York.\n\nIn 1897, Driggs married Eva Frampton in the Salt Lake Temple. They had two sons, H. Wayne Driggs (1902–1951) and H. Perry Driggs. Wayne studied at the University of Utah and New York University as his father had. He was serving as president of what is now Southern Utah University at the time of his death. Perry was an artist and advertising executive, he illustrated at least one of his father's books.\n\nDriggs was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was heavily involved with the church's Sunday School, serving as a member of the organization's general board from 1910 to 1930. He was also involved in starting the first LDS Church Sunday Schools in New York City and Washington, D.C.. Also in New York City, Driggs served for a time as the branch president. When the New York Stake was organized in 1934, Driggs was made a member of the stake high council.\n\nFrom 1908 to 1911 Driggs was the president of the Utah Library and Gymnasium Association. In this capacity he supported the building of joint Library-gymnasiums with the goal of getting those who came for recreation to also read books. In 1919 he served as vice president of the National Education Association. In 1928 he was the president of the Oregon Trail Memorial Association.\nIn 1948, Driggs married Margaret Brazier Quarrier, who had three children from a previous marriage. She died in 2008.\n\nDriggs first novel \"Wild Roses: A Tale of the Rockies\" was published in 1916. Among the novels Driggs wrote were \"Ben the Wagon Boy\" (1944) based on the story of his father, Benjamin Driggs. He also wrote \"George, the Handcart Pioneer\" (1952). He wrote a history of Pleasant Grove, Utah and also co-edited with Ezra Meeker \"Ox-Team days on the Oregon Trail\". He also wrote many English text books.\n\nHe is honored by later historians for his work in collecting the memories of the Oregon Trail and the Pony Express, while there were still surviving people to give first-hand accounts. His book \"The Old West Speaks\" came out in the 1950s, just as television popularized Westerns for a whole new generation.

Ibn Amira was Qadi of Mallorca and worked for the Almohad sultan in Valencia and Sevilla. He moved to Morocco in 1239/40 (after the fall of Valencia in 1238) and continued to work for the sultan there.\n\nIbn Amira was born at Alzira in the province of Valencia. He was born into a well-known Berber family established in al-Andalus, in Shatiba (Xàtiva, Valencia), by the eleventh century. He started his studies in Alzira and focused on \"hadith\", \"fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence), and literature. He was taught by some of the most famous scholars of his day, such as the traditionist Abu l-Rabi Ibn Salim and the grammarian al-Shalawbin.\n\nThe theme of paradise lost (\"al-firdaws al-mafqud\") was expressed by the Valencian exile in his 'Letter to a Friend'. This friend was the poet Ibn al-Abbar. \"An ocean of sadness rages inside us, Our hearts, desperate, burn with eternal flames. The city was so beautiful with its gardens and rivers, The nights were imbued with the sweet fragrance of narcissus.\"\n\nIbn Amira was also the author of a manuscript about the history of Mallorca, \"Tarij Mayurqa\".

{"id": "53414748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53414748", "title": "Jewish quarter of Inca", "text": "Jewish quarter of Inca\n\nInca is a town of 30,000 inhabitants located at the center of the island of Majorca in the Spanish province of Islas Baleares.\n\nA Jewish population is known to have existed on Inca since Jaume I conquered Majorca in 1229, although their presence had already been reported by Severus, bishop of Menorca, in the 5th century.\n\nThe origin of the Jewish quarter (named \"call\" in Catalan) dates from a 1346 order issued by king Peter IV of Aragon upon request from the Governor of Majorca, Gilabert de Centelles, because of disturbances caused by the mostly Christian inhabitants of Inca, who were displeased with the widespread presence of Jews in the town.\n\nThe Governor's lieutenant, Berenguer de Oms, aided by an advisor, made the first proposal for a location for the Jewish quarter. The Jewish community directly informed the king about their refusal of the proposed location because the place known as \"\"Carrer d'en Prats\" had houses in utter disrepair. King Peter IV agreed and informed Gilabert de Centelles about the reservations the Jews had about the place, and ordered that a legal expert trusted by the community be appointed to pick a proper location.\n\nBecause Gilabert de Centelles was due to travel to Valencia and Catalonia on royal business, he delegated the task on Guillermo de Lagostera, who arrived at Inca in 1353 together with legal expert Ramon de Capeir as well as Jaume de Buadella, who was a jury in Palma. They met with the juries of Inca and the secretaries of the aljama and reached an agreement on the place called \"Carrer d'en Pascolet\".\"\n\nFrom then on, economic troubles began. The already existing houses were confiscated, and Jews were charged a price for them that owners did not accept. A period of almost 24 years of constant reclamations to the Governor and to the King ensued. The King decreed that the difference between the appraised value of the houses and the amount paid for them would need to be covered by the University of Inca, which sparked confrontations between house owners and the university.\n\nA committee of two Christians and two Jews was appointed to negotiate the sale and rent prices for the houses in the \"call\", but the University sent a written complaint to the King and the whole process was paralyzed for 10 years. The Governor then gave the order to comply with the King's mandate and resume the process, but it was not actually done until 1363, under new Governor Bernardo de Tous. A new appraisal committee, with two Christians named Montroig and Palou, and two Jews named Faquim and Fallux, was chosen.\n\nNo written record of the place exists between 1363 and 1372. It is known that the previous owners of the confiscated houses appealed to the authorities with new complaints about the prices.\n\nIn 1372, the secretaries of the aljama filed a complaint because routine attacks by Christians on Jews were pushing Jews to leave. Governor Tous ordered the building of two gates to keep the Jewish quarter enclosed so Christians would not assault Jews. Until then only one gate had existed, called \"En Reboll\".\n\nJews are believed to have taken possession of the \"call\" between September and October 1372.\n\nIn 1391, at the time when Christians were launching attacks on Jewish communities in Aragon and Castile, the ones in Inca and Palma suffered a similar fate, and houses and businesses were burned down.\n\nThe Jewish quarter of Inca can be considered the secondary aljama of Majorca. The main one was in Palma, but beginning in 1383 the secretaries of the aljama in Palma delegated functions on their peers in Inca, making the community effectively independent. This arrangement was short-lived as the neighborhood was destroyed in 1391 and most of the survivors converted to Christianity.\n\nAll evidences indicate that the \"call\" had a synagogue. In documents from 1392, convert Bartomeua claimed inheritance rights on properties owned by her grandfather \"\"Jucef Ben Baharon, rabbi of the Jewish School of the Call\".\"\n\nIn the town map made by Dr. Sebastià Sans in 1808, the Jewish quarter appears as \"El Call\" and numbered with 10.\n\nBased on an investigation conducted by Antoni Ginard, Joan Estrany and Francesca Tugores at the University of the Balearic Islands, Jeroni de Berard is currently believed to have made in 1790 the oldest map of Inca, later used by his sometimes collaborator Sebastià Sans to make his own in 1808.\n\nThe owners of the house of Can Monroig, formerly known as Can Mora, carried out a process of total restoration. During the excavation, they found architectural remains and pottery likely dating from the \"call\" or Muslim times.\n\nThe Jewish \"call\" can be found between Sant Francesc, Virtut, Can Valella, Pare Cerdà, El Call, and La Rosa streets.\n\nApproximately 306 people are estimated to have lived in the \"call\", most of which worked in crafts and trading.\n\n\n"}

He was the only child of Edmund Brewster Green, of Smyrna, Delaware, and Mary Fiske Bound, of Middletown, Connecticut. His father was editor of newspapers in Hartford, New York City, and Panama, where he died in 1852, and his widow married Edwin W. Stoughton, of New York, in 1855. On the second marriage of his mother, Edmund Fiske Green assumed the name of his maternal great-grandfather, John Fiske.\n\nAs a child, Fiske exhibited remarkable precocity. He lived at Middletown during childhood, until he entered Harvard. He graduated from Harvard College in 1863 and from Harvard Law School in 1865.\nHe had already admitted to the Suffolk bar in 1864, but never practised law. His career as author began in 1861, with an article on \"Mr. Buckle's Fallacies\" published in the \"National Quarterly Review\". After that, he was a frequent contributor to American and British periodicals.\n\nFrom 1869 to 1871, he was university lecturer on philosophy at Harvard, in 1870 instructor in history there, and assistant librarian 1872-1879. On resigning the latter position in 1879, he was elected a member of the board of overseers, and at the expiration of the six-years' term was re-elected in 1885. Beginning in 1881, he lectured annually on American history at Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, and beginning in 1884 held a professorship of American history at that institution, but continued to make his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He lectured on American history at University College London in 1879, and at the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1880. He gave many hundreds of lectures, chiefly upon American history, in the principal cities of the United States and Great Britain. Fiske was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1884.\n\nThe largest part of his life was devoted to the study of history, but at an early age inquiries into the nature of human progress led him to a careful study of the doctrine of evolution, and it was through the popularization of Charles Darwin's work that he first became known to the public. He applied himself to the philosophical interpretation of Darwin's work and produced many books and essays on this subject. His philosophy was influenced by Herbert Spencer's views on evolution. In a letter from Charles Darwin to John Fiske, dated from 1874, the naturalist remarks: \"I never in my life read so lucid an expositor (and therefore thinker) as you are.\"\nNineteenth-century enthusiasm for brain size as a simple measure of human performance, championed by scientists including Darwin's cousin Francis Galton and the French neurologist Paul Broca, led Fiske to believe in the racial superiority of the \"Anglo-Saxon race\". Fiske's beliefs on race did not preclude his commitment to abolitionist causes. Indeed, so anti-slavery was he that twenty-three years after the cessation of the American Civil War, he declared the North's victory complete \"despite the feeble wails\" of \"unteachable bigots.\" In his book \"The Destiny of Man\" (1884), he devotes a whole chapter to the \"End of the working of natural selection upon man\", describing it as \"a fact of unparalleled grandeur.\" In his view, \"the action of natural selection upon Man has [...] been essentially diminished through the operation of social conditions.\"\n\nIn books such as \"Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy\" (), Fiske aimed to show that \"in reality there has never been any conflict between religion and science, nor is any reconciliation called for where harmony has always existed.\" On page 364, he demonstrates his sensitivity to Christianity as a religion:\n\nWe arrive at a deeper reason than has hitherto been disclosed for the difference between our position with reference to Christianity, and that which has been assumed by Radicalism and by Positivism. It is not merely that we refuse to attack Christianity because we recognize its necessary adaptation to a certain stage of culture, not yet passed by the average minds of the community ; it is that we still regard Christianity as, in the deepest sense, our own religion.\n\nFiske was a popular lecturer on these topics in his early career. Later he turned to historical writings, publishing books such as \"The Discovery of America\" (1892). In addition, he edited, with James Grant Wilson, \"Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography\" (1887). He died, worn out by overwork, at Gloucester, Massachusetts, July 4, 1901.\n\n\n\nIn a brief, but scathing critique of this book in his Preface to \"The New Nation,\" 1962, the historian Merrill Jensen called Fiske's work \"a book of vast influence but of no value as either history or example.\" A few sentences farther in Jensen's Preface, he stated, \"Andrew C. McLaughlin, an impeccably conservative historian of the Constitution who wrote a far better book on the same period, said that Fiske's book was 'altogether without scientific standing, because it is little more than a remarkably skillful adaptation of a very few secondary authorities showing almost no evidence of first hand acquaintance with the sources.'\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17569527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17569527", "title": "Jordan–Israel Mixed Armistice Commission", "text": "Jordan–Israel Mixed Armistice Commission\n\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel Mixed Armistice Commission (HKJI MAC) was the United Nations organisation of observers which dealt with complaints from Jordan and Israel to maintain the fragile cease fire along the demarcation line (Green Line) between Israel and Jordan. At the closing of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, on 3 April 1949, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan signed a truce with Israel called the 1949 Armistice Agreements. The United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation posted Military Observers as part of the Mixed Armistice Commissions (MACs) to Observe the truce on the Cease fire line and to liaise with the Israeli and Jordanian local area commanders. While the 1948 war was concluded with the 1949 Armistice Agreements it has not marked the end of the Arab–Israeli conflict. The HKJ/IMAC was the organisation which monitored the Jordan/Israel truce agreement, the HJK/IMAC Headquarters was located in Jerusalem close to the Green Line and, through close liaison with the UNTSO headquarters in Government House, Jerusalem, was charged with supervising the truce, investigating border incidents, and taking remedial action to prevent the recurrence of such incidents along the Jordan/Israel Green Line.\n\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel Mixed Armistice Commission (HKJIMAC) maintained its headquarters (HQ) in the Jerusalem, after the \"Barrel Incident\" the HKJIMAC HQ was moved into the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) close to the Mandelbaum Gate. The overall HQ of the UNTSO after moving from Cairo to Haifa ended up in Government House, Jerusalem.\n\nMount Scopus Demilitarisation Agreement of 7 July 1948 the agreement was initialled by Franklyn M Begley, a UN official, Colonel Abdullah el Tell and by Colonel David Shaltiel, the Jordanian and Israeli military commanders in Jerusalem.\n\nMount Scopus Demilitarisation Agreement of 21 July 1948 Israeli and Jordanian local commanders with subsidiary agreement initialled by Franklyn M Begley and the local Jordanian commander but not by the Israeli commander.\n\nIn late 1951 General de Ridder negotiated a local commanders' agreement in an effort to reduce border tension. On the first day of February 1952, a new agreement went into effect and for three full months all complaints were handled by the local commanders. Incidents did occur during the period of February to May but they were considered as less serious and far fewer than before. In May 1952 the Local Commanders' Agreement fell before the constant criticism of the Israeli delegates to the MAC. They claimed it was ineffective and yet their own Local Commanders spoke highly of the arrangement. By the end of May 1952 occurrence of incidents was more frequent and they were also becoming more serious.\n\nFurther \"Agreements on measures to curb infiltration\" which was put in force from May 1952. The new agreement stipulated that instructions would be given to all local authorities and commanders to-strengthen measures to ensure the prevention of all illegal crossings of the demarcation line. It was also provided that firing would he reduced to a strict minimum; that it would be prohibited during the day-time on people who had crossed the demarcation line, unless they resisted arrest. Stolen property was to be returned as soon as found, without waiting for any-thing to be handed over by the other side in return; flocks found grazing on the wrong side of the demarcation line would be returned immediately subject to payment, according to fixed rates, for their keep and also for the damage they might have caused. It was, moreover, agreed that complaints would be kept at a minimum by attempting to settle minor incidents at the local, commander's level. A few days after that new agreement had come into force, the Jordanians captured an Israel driving-school vehicle which had made an apparently strange mistake in leaving the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway and crossing the demarcation line in very difficult terrain in the Latrun area. There were in the vehicle a civilian and three soldiers. The new agreement provided that members of the security forces of either Party who crossed the demarcation line \"by mistake\" should be returned after interrogation. The Jordanians having delayed the return of the three soldiers, Israel announced on 8 January 1953 that the new agreement to reduce and solve incidents was null and void. The agreement provided that, if it came to expiration, the old \"agreement on measures to curb infiltration\", signed on 13 May 1952, would automatically re-enter into force. On 8 January 1953, Israel also gave formal notice of its desire to terminate the old agreement to two weeks' time, as permitted by the text of that agreement. On 22 January 1953, the local commander's agreement for the prevention and settlement of minor incidents, particularly the crossing of the line by infiltrators or by flocks, came to an end. On that day an Israeli soldier was killed when an Israeli patrol crossed the demarcation line and exchanged fire with the. inhabitants of Falameh village.<ref name=\"S/PV.630 of 27 October 1953\">UN Doc S/PV.630 of 27 October 1953 Major General Vagn BENNIKE Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization Report to UN</ref>\n\nFollowing the 101 (1953). Resolution of 24 November 1953 [S/3139/Rev.2] where the Security Council \"took note of the fact that there is substantial evidence of crossing of the demarcation line by unauthorized persons often resulting in acts of violence and requests the Government of Jordan to continue and strengthen the measures which they are already taking to prevent such crossing.\" The Jordanian authorities carried out the following measures:\n\n(a) Increase of the number of police assigned to the border area;\n\n(b) Increase of the number of patrols;\n\n(c) Replacement of village mukhtars and area commanders, where laxity of border control was suspected;\n\n(d) Removal from the border area of suspected infiltrators and imposing of heavy sentences on known infiltrators;\n\nCommander E H Hutchison USMC (Chairman of the MAC) was able to confirm and verify that Jordan had increased the number of border police and border patrols by over 30 per cent and that three village Mukhtars and thirteen area commanders had been moved from their sectors because of laxness in border control. Also that the jails at Nablus, Hebron, and Amman were \"loaded\" with prisoners, many of whom were being held on nothing more than suspicion of infiltration. Commander E H Hutchison USMC had seen the order that was sent out from Arab Legion Headquarters to area commanders to prevent illegal cultivation. At the same time new powers had been granted to local judges to enable them to take firmer measures against those who grazed their flocks too close to the border or cultivated beyond the UN line of demarcation. Bedouin tribes living east of the Wadi Araba in the southern part of Jordan had been warned to stay back from the frontier area. The UN observers were aware of all of Jordan's efforts to curb infiltration and that those efforts had reached the total capabilities of the country.\n\nThe HKJIMAC condemned Israel expelling some 200 inhabitants of the village of Wadi Fukin and sending them across the Armistice Agreement lines on 15 July 1949.\n\nIn late December 1951 a rape murder occurred. The MAC investigating officer, Major Loreaux, reported to the Chairman of the Mixed Armistice Commission, Commander E H Hutchison USNR and Commandant Bouvet that the body of the girl had been found hidden in a cave about a mile from the Jordan/Israel border, \"the girl had been raped, murdered and that her face had been mutilated\". Major Loreaux reported that at the scene there was nothing, however, that indicate that Jordanian infiltrators had committed the crime. The case had not therefore been discussed by the Mixed Armistice Commission. Major Loreaux further\n\n“expressed the opinion that the Israeli police would have a better chance of finding the killer than the Arabs would.”\n\nOn 6 January 1952 at Beit Jalla an Israeli \"reprisal raid\" occurred where three houses were demolished by explosive charges. In the first house targeted the upper floor had been completely destroyed by a demolition charge. The lower part of the house which had been built into the side of the hill, was still partially intact, although bullet holes pockmarked the walls and doors.\n\nThe inhabitants of the first house, a twenty-three-year-old Arab and his wife, had been killed by the blast.\n\n\"There was little left for burial.\"\n\nAt the second target the demolition charge had been less effective and only one wall was damaged the windows, however, were all shattered and the walls, as with the first house targeted, were again pockmarked by the heavy rifle and sub-machine gun fire. Commander E H Hutchison then searched the vicinity for evidence and interrogated witnesses. The adult male occupant of the second house was brought to the investigators for interrogation. While relating the events, the father held tightly to his little three-year-old daughter \"as if he might lose her at any moment.\"\n\nThe fathers’ version of events was that on hearing a blast, this was his neighbor's house being demolished by explosive, just seconds before the wall of his own home was blown in.\n\n“He had grabbed a rifle and told his wife to take their daughter and rush to the main part of the village for safety. The wife, who was eight-months pregnant, moved cautiously to follow his orders. She had taken only a few steps from the back door when the Israelis, who were firing from behind a stone wall, turned their fire in her direction. The bullet that passed through her body from the back snuffed out the life she was carrying, but her own life was miraculously spared.”\n\nThe third house targeted contained the bodies of a mother and her four children, ranging in age from 6 to 14.\n\n“They were sprawled about the room their bodies riddled by bullets and grenade fragments.”\n\nCommander Hutchison then collected up the available evidence; there was abandoned demolition charges bearing the Israeli markings. Pinned to the three targeted houses was also a \"rose coloured leaflet\".\n\n“The messages, written in Arabic Translated as, \"There will always be arrows in our quiver': \"On 4 December 1951, persons from Beit Jalla killed a young Jewess near Beit Vaghan after committing towards her a crime that will never be expiated. What we have done here now is recompense for this horrendous crime we can never remain silent when it comes to criminals. There will always be arrows in our quivers for the likes of these. Let those who would know, (know) BEWARE.”\n\nThe United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation issued a condemnation to Israel for the \"serious breach of the General Armistice Agreement\" in the Beit Jalla reprisal raid.\n\nThe Israeli delegates did not deny the guilt of Israel they abstained in the voting. No Israeli attempt to bring to trial the estimated 45 persons responsible for this crime was ever made known to the Commission. Those Observers who had been on the mission for many months merely shrugged it off: \"People carrying out official orders are seldom brought to trial\n\n22nd and 28–29 January 1953 Israeli military forces estimated at 120 to 150 men, using 2-inch mortars, 3-inch mortars, P.I.A.T. (projectors, infantry, anti-tank) weapons, bangalore torpedoes (long metal tubes containing an explosive charge), machine-guns, grenades and small arms, crossed the demarcation line and attacked the Arab villages of Falameh (22 January) and Rantis (28/29 January). At Falameh the mukhtar was killed, seven other villagers were wounded, and three houses were demolished. The attack lasted four and a half hours. Israel was condemned for this act by the Mixed Armistice Commission.\nThe body of an Israeli soldier with an Israeli identification disc marked with the number 232046 and the name Yehuda Kacim, in Hebrew was handed over to two officers of the Israeli Army who accepted it as that of an Israeli soldier without any reservations on 23 January.\n\n22 April 1953, firing broke out at sunset within Jerusalem along the demarcation line on a length of about 4 kilometres. It lasted two hours, until the cease-fire arranged by United Nations observers came into effect. On the following day, there were isolated shots in the early morning and in the afternoon. There were twenty Jordanian casualties-ten killed and ten wounded. Six Israelis were wounded. The Jerusalem incident was investigated by United Nations observers. After studying the evidence thus collected, my predecessor, General Riley, in a report to the Security Council on the violation of the cease-fire [S/3607], stated that it appeared impossible to determine who fired the first shot.\n\nOn 25, 26 and 27 May 1953, the two parties submitted complaints alleging violation of the General Armistice Agreement by civilians and military personnel in the Al-Dawayima area. In an emergency meeting of the Mixed Armistice Commission, both parties agreed to a mixed investigation. United Nations observers accompanied the representatives to the demarcation line to establish the facts. Despite the cease-fire which had been previously arranged, heavy firing broke out during the investigation. The origin of the incident was the illegal cultivation by Jordanians of land in Israel territory. Armed Jordanians had penetrated Israel territory to harvest crops, and other Jordanians had fired across the demarcation line to protect the harvesters. On the other hand, Israel troops had fired across the demarcation line at Jordanians in Jordan territory, and Israeli soldiers had burned crops in Jordan territory. The use of specially manufactured incendiary bombs to destroy a lorry inside the village of Qibya. The necks and trigger attachments of these bombs which were found near the burned vehicle at Qibya was the type of bomb used by Israel military forces to burn the field of grain inside Jordan on 28 May 1953 in the Al-Dawayima area. This incident was discussed at the 122nd Mixed Armistice Commission meeting.\n\nDuring the latter part of May 1953, incidents took place which cost the lives of three persons and in which six others were wounded. There seemed to be no motive for these crimes other than killing for the sake of killing. On the night of 25–26 May, an armed group from Jordan attacked two homes in Beit Arif, wounding two women. The same night, armed Jordanians attacked a home in Beit Nabala, killing a woman and wounding her husband and two children. Jordan was condemned for all three of these attacks. On the night of 9 June, armed Jordanians blew up a house in Tirat Yehuda, killing one man, And two nights later an armed band struck at a house in Kfar Hess, killing a woman and seriously wounding her husband. Jordan was again condemned by the Mixed Armistice Commission for these attacks. Both Governments were greatly concerned over the happenings during this fortnight, and a great effort was made to stop the work of these groups, which seemed bent on creating tension along the border.\n\n11 August 1953, Israel military forces using demolition mines, bangalore torpedoes, 2-inch mortars, machine-guns and small arms attacked the villages of Idna, Surif and Wadi Fukin, inflicting casualties among the inhabitants and destroying dwellings. The body of an Israel soldier in full uniform with identification tag was found in the village of Idna after the attack. The Mixed Armistice Commission condemned Israel for these attacks.\n\n2 September 1953: Palestinian infiltrated from Jordan, and reached the neighbourhood of Katamon, in the heart of Jerusalem. They threw hand grenades in all directions. Miraculously, no one was hurt.\n\n2 October 1953: The explosion of a land mine on the Israel railway north of Eyal derailed an Israel freight train. The Mixed Armistice Commission has held Jordan responsible for this act of violence which caused no loss of life and relatively little damage, as the train was made up of empty tank cars.\n\n14 15 October 1953: Qibya massacre The crossing of the demarcation line by a force approximating one half of a fully equipped battalion from the Israel regular army. Into Qibya village, to attack the inhabitants by firing from automatic weapons, throwing grenades, and using Bangalore torpedoes together with TNT explosive. Forty-one dwelling houses and a school building were destroyed. Resulting in the murder of forty-two lives (later increased to 53) including men, women [and] children, and the wounding of fifteen persons and the damage of a police car, [and] at the same time, the crossing of a part of the same group into Shuqba village, [are] a breach of article III, para-graph 2 of the General Armistice Agreement. With the report of E. H. HUTCHISON \"Commander, United States Navy\"\n\nIsrael Unit 101 commanded by Ariel Sharon, attacks Qibya in the West Bank killing 53 Palestinians. between thirty and forty buildings had been completely demolished, including the school, the water-pumping station, the police station and the telephone office. Bullet-riddled bodies near the doorways and multiple bullet hits on the doors of the demolished houses indicated that the inhabitants had been forced to remain inside until their homes were blown up over them. Witnesses were uniform in describing their experience as a night of horror, during which Israel soldiers moved about in their village blowing up buildings, firing into doorways and windows with automatic weapons and throwing hand grenades. A number of unexploded hand grenades, marked with Hebrew letters indicating recent Israel manufacture, and three bags of TNT were found in and about the village.\n\nBy the time the acting chairman of the Mixed Armistice Commission left Qibya, twenty-seven bodies had been dug from the rubble. The villagers were digging for others who they claimed were still buried beneath the building stones. They believed that the number of dead might reach sixty. Six wounded persons were seen in the village, and the acting chairman was told that there were other wounded persons in the hospital.\n\n16 December 1953, two Israeli soldiers were killed while on patrol inside Israel territory (approximate M. R. 1433-1097). On 21 December, the Mixed Armistice Commission condemned Jordan for this incident.<ref name=\"S/3183 & Corr.1 of 1 March 1954\">UN Doc S/3183 & Corr.1 of 1 March 1954 Report by the Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine to the Security Council pursuant to the Council's resolution S/3139/Rev.2 of 24 November 1953</ref>\n\n18 December 1953, a car was ambushed on the Hebron road (approximate M.R. 1658-1221) inside Jordan and an Arab Legion medical officer was killed.

Israel was condemned for this incident (24 December).\nThe last three incidents were apparently reprisal attacks for the killing of the two Israeli soldiers on 16 December. Two Arabs responsible for this crime were arrested by the Jordan police a few days later.\n\n14 February 1954, an Israeli villager on guard duty at Mahasyia, near Deiraban, (approximate M.

No evidence was introduced to indicate that Jordanians were guilty of this crime and on 18 February the Chairman voted against the Israeli draft resolution condemning Jordan.\n\n18 February, the Mixed Armistice Commission condemned Israel and Jordan for firing across the demarcation line on 14 February near Deir al-Ghusun (approximate M. R. 1575-1955) in the northern area. This firing resulted in the killing, of one Jordanian.\n\n16 March 1954, Israelis of the Ein Gev colony began ploughing 130 dunums of land situated near the colony and belonging to the Arab population of demilitarised Nuqeib, in violation of the verbal agreement concluded at Samara in 1950 to the effect that the two parties should retain and work the said land until the problem was settled.\n\n17 March 1954: Ma-aleh Akrabim incident. A Party of Arabs ambushed a bus travelling from Eilat to Tel Aviv, and opened fire at short range when the bus reached the area of Ma'ale Akrabim in the northern Negev. In the initial ambush, the gunmen killed the driver and wounded most of the passengers. The gunmen then boarded the bus, and shot each passenger, one by one. Eleven passengers were murdered. Survivors recounted how the murderers spat on the bodies and abused them. The Israeli claimed that the gunmen could clearly be traced back to the Jordanian border, some 20 km from the site of the attack.

Israel communications referring to alleged violations by Jordan of the General Armistice Agreement have been addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, with the request that they should be circulated to the members of the Security Council. The Chief of Staff of the Truce Supervision Organization in Jerusalem has been informed of such alleged violations of the General Armistice Agreement only on receiving from New York a copy of the Security Council document. The non-co-operation of the Israel Government has prevented the investigation of such alleged violations in conformity with the provisions of the General Armistice Agreement.\n\n29 March 1954 at 07.00 hours, local time, at Nahalin village, some 35 kilometres from the demarcation line \"an Israel armed force, well equipped, surrounded the village from three directions and penetrated inside the village and opened fire from different automatic weapons, threw hand-grenades and placed mines at some houses, including the mosque of the village. As a result of this brutal attack, 9 persons—8 men and 1 woman—were killed, and 14 others were injured and taken to hospital. Fire lasted for about one hour and a half, and was returned by the village guards. Then the aggressors withdrew. Mines, grenades and other warlike materials bearing Hebrew markings were found on the spot.\n\n13 November 1966, the police fort at Rujm al-Madfa' was destroyed when seventeen tanks took up position and opened fire against the police post, using explosive charges.

Twenty Jordanian army trucks, 2 Jordanian army jeeps and one civilian, bus were totally demolished. One Jordanian army truck had been damaged by machine-gun fire. In a flour mill, 2 explosive charges were found which had failed to detonate. The United Nations Military Observers also observed in the area, one Bedouin dwelling tent and 3 Jordanian army tents completely destroyed. 20 domestic animals which had been killed either by explosions or by small arms fire. At Kh Jimba a column of 60 to 70 vehicles, including armored cars, jeeps and tanks, crossed the ADL towards the villages of Kh Jimba and Kh El Markaz.

He was a grandson of José de la Riva-Agüero y Looz and a patrilineal descendant of José de la Riva-Agüero y Sánchez-Boquete, first President of Peru, and the Princess Caroline-Arnoldine de Looz-Corswarem.\n\nHe was educated at Recoleta Sacred Heart School and University of San Marcos, where he read philosophy, human sciences and law. While at San Marcos, he gained a reputation for academic excellence and political activism, and was part of the so-called Generation of 900. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Doctorate degree in human sciences in 1905 and 1910, respectively, and a Bachelor of Arts in law in 1911. Riva-Agüero wrote his senior thesis on \"History in Peru\" (\"La Historia en el Perú\"), the earliest work of historiography to be written in Latin America. Eventually, he became a lecturer of history of Peru at San Marcos in 1910.\n\nIn 1911, he published an article defending the issuance of an amnesty law for the political prisoners involving in the 1909 coup d'état attempt against the Augusto Leguía's regime. The Leguía's Minister of the Interior, Juan de Dios Salazar, ordered his arrest, which immediately provoked bitter university protests and demonstrations that resulted in violent political repression by the National Gendarmerie. This event was the first confrontation between university students and police forces in the history of Peru. A few days after his imprisonment, he was released due to political pressure and the Minister resigned from his office.\n\nAfter a long journey through Spain, where he did research in several archives and gave lectures in Seville, Riva-Agüero co-founded the moderate Democratic National Party in 1915 and supported the presidential candidature of the Civilista José Pardo y Barreda in the April 1915 election. Immediately after Leguía's 1919 coup against Pardo, he wrote a manifesto and went into voluntary exile in Europe. During his first years in exile Riva-Agüero lived in Madrid, then he moved to Paris and later to Rome, where spent the most part of the eleven years of the Leguía's Government. When his mother died in 1926, he succeeded her as Marquis of Montealegre de Aulestia and was legally adopted by her maternal aunt Rosa Julia, 4th Marquise of Casa-Dávila, who later inherited him the title and a large fortune. In exile, Riva-Agüero abandoned his moderate views and came into contact with the works of Catholic rightist authors such as Jacques Bainville and Charles Maurras and soon became a disciple of their ideas.\n\nRiva-Agüero returned to Peru in August 1930 when a military coup led by Commander Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro overthrew the Leguía's regime. In June 1931, he was elected as Director of the Institute of History at University of San Marcos, but resigned after just one month due to differences with the student government. Although he initially refused to take up any seat in the 1931 Constituent Assembly or otherwise participate in the Sánchez Cerro's interim \"junta\", he supported the Commander's presidential candidature in the 1931 general election. In May that same year, he had been appointed Mayor of Lima by the Samanez Ocampo's provisional Government. As Mayor, he especially patronize cultural activities, but also had to deal with the 1931 telephone strike.\n\nAfter the Sánchez Cerro's assassination in 1933, the Assembly proclaimed General Óscar R. Benavides President of the Republic. In November 1933, Benavides appointed Riva-Agüero Prime Minister and Minister of Justice. He appointed Commander A. Henriod to head the Ministry of Interior and advocated a policy of repression against the leftist APRA and the Communist Party.\n\nAfter his spell as Prime Minister Riva-Agüero moved further to the right. He launched his own hard-line Catholic \"Acción Patriótica\" movement after the model of \"Action Française\" and before long he had changed the name of this group to the Peruvian Fascist Brotherhood. He personally declared his support for Italian fascism and Falangism although it has been argued that politically he was more of a very elitist Catholic rightist who also supported Hispanidad. Initially Riva-Agüero gained a strong following for his new endeavour but before long his newfound extremism, combined with his increasingly odd personal behaviour, began to lose him his credibility. He became strongly anti-Semitic and soon took to praising Adolf Hitler, losing him some support. Meanwhile, he started insisting that followers called him the Marquis of Aulestia, a title that had been in the family but had long since fell into disuse and which had little currency in a republic such as Peru, and his generally arrogant demeanour cost him more support. His persona was further damaged when he even took to occasional bouts of public transvestism at functions. He finally drifted into obscurity in 1942 when Peru officially became one of the Allies although he continued to write articles in defence of the Axis powers until his death.\n\n\n\n"}

Presently the oldest preserved building on the island, since October 2012 the hut has been hosting the \"Livingston Island Museum\", a branch of the National Museum of History in Sofia. It was the first permanent building established by Bulgaria in Antarctica, which laid the foundations for Bulgaria’s systematic scientific research in the Livingston Island area under the Antarctic Treaty System. The building is a designated Historic Site or Monument of Antarctica.\n\nThe hut is located at , which is 70 m south by east of the main building of St. Kliment Ohridski base and 200 m from the coast of South Bay, at elevation 15.5 m. It stands between two branches of the melt-water Rezovski Creek, surmounted by Pesyakov Hill and Sinemorets Hill, and overlooking Grand Lagoon.\n\nThe Lame Dog Hut is a Bulgarian-made 6 by 3.5 m sandwich panel structure (metal face sheets, polyurethane foam core) with a mess area and accommodation capacity for 6 persons. It has a particular technical and architectural value in its materials, design and method of construction, namely in the ingenuity and skills demonstrated by the Bulgarian scientists and technical personnel who, by using material at hand, converted what was, basically, a standard dwelling container designed for use in the then Bulgarian logging industry in northern Russia, into a cozy and hospitable Antarctic facility much favoured by people from various nations visiting or working at the Bulgarian base. The experience gained during the construction and maintenance of the Lame Dog Hut was instrumental in the subsequent expansion of the Bulgarian base.\n\nThe name \"Lame Dog Hut\" dates to around 1999, when the hut was found bouncing in the wind with its support legs damaged during the winter. This somewhat peculiar name became established both in common usage and also in the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute’s official documentation. \n\nThe prefabricated hut made in Pazardzhik was assembled on Livingston Island during the First Bulgarian Antarctic Expedition by the team of Zlatil Vergilov, Asen Chakarov, Stefan Kaloyanov and Nikolay Mihnevski from 26 to 28 April 1988, with the logistic support of the Soviet Research Ship \"Mikhail Somov\" under Captain Feliks Pesyakov. It was renovated and, together with the adjacent Russian Hut, a small storehouse, commissioned as Antarctic base St. Kliment Ohridski (often shortened by non-Bulgarians to \"Ohridski base\") on 11 December 1993. It remained the base’s only dwelling facility (with tents used when additional accommodation was necessary) until a new main building was completed in 1998. Occupied during all summer seasons since 1993, the hut has proved most suitable under local conditions. It has also been used as radio shack and post office (Post Office \"Antarctica 1090\" maintained by Bulgarian Posts Plc) since 1994.\n\nSince October 2012 the Lame Dog Hut has been hosting a museum exhibition of associated artefacts from the early Bulgarian science and logistic operations in Antarctica, designated as \"Livingston Island Museum\" – a branch of the National Museum of History in Sofia.\n\nSince June 2015 the hut has been designated a Historic Site or Monument of Antarctica (HSM 91). As the oldest preserved building on Livingston Island (since 2009, when the old buildings of the nearby Spanish base Juan Carlos I were removed and replaced by new ones), the hut and its associated artefacts are considered part of the cultural and historic heritage of the island and Antarctica. Another Historic Site or Monument on Livingston Island is the San Telmo Cairn (HSM 59) at Cape Shirreff, which commemorates the 644 officers, soldiers and seamen lost when the Spanish warship \"San Telmo\" sank nearby in September 1819.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4531292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4531292", "title": "Linkage (linguistics)", "text": "Linkage (linguistics)\n\nIn historical linguistics, a linkage is a group of related languages that is formed when a proto-language breaks up into a network of dialects that gradually differentiates into separate languages.\n\nThe term was introduced by Malcolm Ross in his study of Western Oceanic languages . It is contrasted with a family, which arises when the proto-language speech community separates into groups that are isolated from each other, rather than forming a network.\n\nLinkages are formed when languages emerged historically from the diversification of an earlier dialect continuum. Its members may have diverged despite sharing subsequent innovations, or such dialects may have come into contact and so converged. In any dialect continuum, innovations are shared between neighbouring dialects in intersecting patterns. The patterns of intersecting innovations continue to be evident as the dialect continuum turns into a linkage.\n\nAccording to the comparative method, a group of languages that exclusively shares a set of innovations constitutes a \"(genealogical) subgroup\". A linkage is thus usually characterised by the presence of intersecting subgroups. The tree model does not allow for the existence of intersecting subgroups and so is ill-suited to represent linkages, which are better approached using the wave model.\n\nThe cladistic approach underlying the tree model requires the common ancestor of each subgroup to be discontiguous from other related languages and unable to share any innovation with them after their \"separation\". That assumption is absent from Ross and François's approach to linkages. Their genealogical subgroups also have languages descended from a common ancestor, as defined by a set of exclusively-shared innovations), but whosr common ancestor may not have been discretely separated from its neighbours. For example, a chain of dialects {A B C D E F} may undergo a number of linguistic innovations, some affecting {BCD}, others {CDE}, still others {DEF}. Insofar as each set of dialects was mutually intelligible at the time of the innovations, all can be seen as forming separate languages. Among them, Proto-BCD will be the language ancestral to the subgroup BCD, Proto-CDE the language ancestral to CDE and so on. As for the language descended from dialect D, it will belong simultaneously to three \"intersecting subgroups\" (BCD, CDE and DEF).\n\nIn both the tree and the linkage approaches, genealogical subgroups are strictly defined by their shared inheritance from a common ancestor. Simply, although trees entail that all proto-languages must be discretely separated, the linkage model avoids that assumption.\n\nFrançois also claims that a tree can be considered a special case of a linkage in which all subgroups happen to be nested and temporally ordered from broadest to narrowest.\n\nAn example of a linkage is the one formed the Central Malayo-Polynesian languages of the Banda Sea (a sea in the South Moluccas in Indonesia). The Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages are commonly divided into two branches, Central Malayo-Polynesian and Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, each having certain defining features that unify them and distinguish them from the other. However, whereas Proto-Eastern and Proto-Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian can be reconstructed (the sibling and the parent of Central Malayo-Polynesian, respectively), a Proto-Central Malayo-Polynesian language reconstruction, distinct from Proto-Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian does not seem feasible.\n\nIt may be that the branches of Central Malayo-Polynesian are each as old as Eastern Malayo-Polynesian but that they went on to exchange features that are now considered to define them as a family. The features common to Eastern Malayo-Polynesian can be assumed to have been present in a single ancestral language, but that is not the case for Central Malayo-Polynesian.\n\nThis scenario does not amount to a denial of a common ancestry of the Central Malayo-Polynesian languages. It is only a reinterpretation of the \"age\" of the relationship to be just as old as their relationship to Eastern Malayo-Polynesian.\n\nFrançois (2014, p. 171) suggests that most of the world's language families are really \"linkages\" that are made up of intersecting, not nested, subgroups. He cites the Oceanic languages of northern Vanuatu as well as those of Fiji and of Polynesia and at least some sections of the Pama-Nyungan, Athabaskan, Semitic, Sinitic, and Indo-European families.\n\nWithin Indo-European, Indo-Aryan, Western Romance and Germanic, in turn, form linkages of their own.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11584195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11584195", "title": "Marjorie Barnard", "text": "Marjorie Barnard\n\nMarjorie Faith Barnard AO (16 August 18978 May 1987) was an Australian novelist and short story writer, critic, historian - and librarian. She went to school and university in Sydney, and then trained as a librarian. She was employed as a librarian for two periods in her life (1923–1935 and 1942–1950), but her main passion was writing.\n\nBarnard met her collaborator, Flora Eldershaw (1897–1956), at the University of Sydney, and they published their first novel, \"A House is Built\" in 1929. Their collaboration spanned the next two decades, and covered the full range of their writing: fiction, history and literary criticism. They published under the pseudonym M. Barnard Eldershaw. Marjorie Barnard was a significant part of the literary scene in Australia between the wars and, for both her work as M. Barnard Eldershaw and in her own right, is recognised as a major figure in Australian letters.\n\nBarnard was born in Ashfield, Sydney, to Ethel Frances and Oswald Holme Barnard, and was their only surviving child. She had polio as a child and was taught by a governess until she was 10 years old. She then attended the Cambridge School and Sydney Girls High School. After high school, she went to the University of Sydney, from which she graduated with first class honours and the first University Medal for History in 1918. She was offered a scholarship to Oxford, but her father refused her permission to go, and so she trained as a librarian at the Sydney Teachers' College. She worked as a librarian at the Public Library of New South Wales and then the Sydney Technical College until 1935 when she left to write full-time, at the encouragement of her friend, writer and literary critic, Nettie Palmer, and made possible through a small allowance from her father. She wrote to Nettie Palmer at the time that she was seeking \"some sort of fulfilment, to run my vital energy into a creative mould instead of just letting it soak into the thirsty sand of a daily round\".\n\nShe joined the Fellowship of Australian Writers in 1935, of which Flora Eldershaw was President for a couple of terms. During the next five years, she, Flora Eldershaw and Frank Dalby Davison were known as \"the triumvirate\" for their joint work on political and cultural policy. As well as Flora Eldershaw and Frank Dalby Davison, Marjorie Barnard knew many of the leading writers of her time, including Vance and Nettie Palmer, Miles Franklin, Katharine Susannah Prichard, Eleanor Dark, Xavier Herbert and Patrick White.\n\nBarnard travelled overseas several times, the first time in 1933 with her mother. She loved travel but in 1986 stated that \"I think it's dangerous for writers to leave their roots. I am - was - an Australian writer\".\n\nIn the late 1930s, though she still lived at home, she and Flora Eldershaw took a flat in Potts Point where they held regular gatherings which operated something like a literary salon. Many of the leading literary and cultural figures of the time visited the flat, and it was here that she was able to spend time with Frank Dalby Davison whom she admitted many years later had been her love. She wrote of this relationship to her writer friend, Jean Devanny, \"I was deeply in love with him ... We were lovers for eight years ... In 1942 I knew things were coming to an end ... I was, as he said, very naïve\". She admitted to Devanny that the break-up of this relationship was the cause of a serious illness.\n\nHer father died in 1940, leaving her with an ailing mother. She returned to library work in 1942, at the Public Library of New South Wales and then the CSIRO. However, her mother's death in 1949 left her 'modestly independent' enabling her to leave work in 1950.\n\nMarjorie Barnard never married, and destroyed essentially all her correspondence. However, several of her correspondents, particularly Nettie Palmer and Jean Devanny, kept her letters to them, and some of these are now held in Australian libraries and archives, such as the National Library of Australia.\n\nShe died at Point Clare on the Central Coast of New South Wales, in 1987, aged 89.\n\nMarjorie Barnard's writing career spanned four decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, with the majority of her works being written in the 1930s-1940s, a period in Australia noted for its flowering of women writers. Despite this, in an interview in 1986, she stated that there was no such thing as a \"woman writer\", that \"there are writers good and bad. Only the work counts\". In the same interview, she also said, \"I never achieved what I set out to do; I never achieved the goals I set myself for each book. I suppose the only exception to that would be \"The Persimmon Tree\"\". She wrote little in the last twenty years of her life.\n\nBarnard's writing career was inspired by her meeting Flora Eldershaw in her first year at university, and her first work was a children's book, \"The Ivory Gate\", published in 1920. However, on seeing an advertisement for \"The Bulletin\" prize, she and Eldershaw wrote their first collaborative novel, \"A House is Built\", which went on to win the prize in 1928, shared with Katharine Susannah Prichard's \"Coonardoo\".\n\nUsing the pseudonym M. Barnard Eldershaw, they wrote five novels, as well as a wide range of non-fiction works including histories and criticisms, such as their well-regarded \"Essays in Australian Fiction\" (1938). This book contained essays on Henry Handel Richardson, Katharine Susannah Prichard, Leonard Mann, Martin Boyd (under his pseudonym Martin Mills), Christina Stead and Eleanor Dark.\n\nTheir final collaborative novel was \"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\". It was published in 1945 as \"Tomorrow and Tomorrow\". It is considered to be one of Australia's major early science fiction novels and was highly regarded by Australia's only Nobel Prize winner for literature, Patrick White. However, it was censored for political reasons at the time and was not published in its entirety until Virago Press reissued it in 1983.\n\nWhile it is generally accepted that Barnard was the more expressive writer of the two, and that Eldershaw contributed her acute critical sense, Rorabacher also states that in their early collaborative novels it is impossible to distinguish their separate contributions. Overall, Barnard did more of the creative writing while Eldershaw focused on the structure and development of their major works. However, because Eldershaw was the more outgoing and articulate of the two, it was frequently assumed, at the time, that she was the dominant partner. This did not spoil their partnership, which lasted two decades, bearing testament to the fact that both derived value from it.\n\nBarnard's most successful fictional work written in her own right is \"The Persimmon Tree and Other Stories\" (1943). It was reissued by Virago in 1985, with the inclusion of three additional stories not previously published in book form. The title story, \"The Persimmon Tree\", is one of Australia's most anthologised stories. The stories were published soon after the end of her relationship with Davison, and were seen by Barnard as some \"compensation for the hurt that was integral to their production\". As Dever writes, \"stories such as ‘The Persimmon Tree’, ‘The Woman Who Did the Right Thing’ and ‘Beauty is Strength’ take as their themes the consequences of illicit love, rivalry between women and the withdrawal and stoicism sometimes demanded of injured lovers\".\n\nAfter Eldershaw's death, Barnard continued to write, mostly histories and literary criticism, including, in 1967, the first biography of Miles Franklin. She admired Franklin's character and energy but was less enamoured of her literary abilities, writing that 'her writings are eclipsed by her personality' and that 'she was no philosopher, displayed little skill in constructing her books, and not much originality in plot.'\n\nHer \"History of Australia\", published in 1963, was well-reviewed at the time. One reviewer compared it favourably with histories by Keith Hancock, A.G.L. Shaw, Max Crawford and Douglas Pike, writing that she \"writes good narrative prose and avoids, on the whole, analysis, although she can provide good commonsense summaries (as on the convict tradition or the Federation movement) when she wishes\". He goes on to say that \"her argument is not original, but she states it with clarity, a well-calculated density of detail, and with authority, especially when she writes on the subject she knows best, Macquarie's world\". He does however note that there are some errors and inconsistencies, and gaps in the bibliography.\n\nWhile she never joined a political party, she was affected by the social and political upheavals of the 1930s. During this period, Barnard, Eldershaw and Frank Dalby Davison worked together to ensure the Fellowship of Australian Writers (FAW) functioned as a trade union of professional writers and that it adopted progressive positions on political questions. It was this work that resulted in their being known as 'the triumvirate'. Fiona Capp writes, for example, that through the FAW Barnard and Eldershaw actively lobbied against National Security regulations and infringements on the freedom of speech.\n\nBarnard regarded herself as a 'nineteenth century liberal' and defined herself as a pacifist. In 1940, she joined the Peace Pledge Union. She edited a collection of essays defending freedom, which was not published, and a pamphlet \"The Case for the Future\", which was banned by the censor. She also joined the Australian Labor Party as confirmed in several letters to Nettie Palmer, although later denied that she had ever joined. Dever suggests that this denial may be due to the Cold War witch hunts of the 1950s in which her name, among others, was mentioned. She suggests that Barnard received more criticism at that time than Eldershaw, who was frequently defended as a member of the CLF Advisory Board, and that, not being fond of publicity, she was likely to have been \"deeply disturbed\" by \"the accusations and embarrassingly public attention\".\n\nBarnard provided for a biennial prize in her will, in which $500 is offered as first prize for a short story of 3,000 words. When Yasmine Gooneratne won the award in 1991, it was titled the Marjorie Barnard Literary Award for Fiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is speculated that the resulting cooling would lead to widespread crop failure and famine. When developing computer models of nuclear-winter scenarios, researchers use the conventional bombing of Hamburg, and the Hiroshima firestorm in World War II as example cases where soot might have been injected into the stratosphere, alongside modern observations of natural, large-area wildfire-firestorms.\n\n\"Nuclear winter,\" or as it was initially termed, \"nuclear twilight,\" began to be considered as a scientific concept in the 1980s, after it became clear that an earlier hypothesis, that fireball generated NOx emissions would devastate the ozone layer, was losing credibility. It was within this context that the climatic effects of soot from fires was \"chanced upon\" and soon became the new focus of the climatic effects of nuclear war. In these model scenarios, various soot clouds containing uncertain quantities of soot were assumed to form over cities, oil refineries, and more rural missile silos. Once the quantity of soot is decided upon by the researchers, the climate effects of these soot clouds are then modeled. The term \"nuclear winter\" was a neologism coined in 1983 by Richard P. Turco in reference to a 1-dimensional computer model created to examine the \"nuclear twilight\" idea, this 1-D model output the finding that massive quantities of soot and smoke would remain aloft in the air for on the order of years, causing a severe planet-wide drop in temperature. Turco would later distance himself from these extreme 1-D conclusions.\n\nAfter the failure of the predictions on the effects of the 1991 Kuwait oil fires, that were made by the primary team of climatologists that advocate the hypothesis, over a decade passed without any new published papers on the topic. More recently, the same team of prominent modellers from the 1980s have begun again to publish the outputs of computer models, these newer models produce the same general findings as their old ones, that the ignition of 100 firestorms, each comparable in intensity to that observed in Hiroshima in 1945, could produce a \"small\" nuclear winter. These firestorms would result in the injection of soot (specifically black carbon) into the Earth's stratosphere, producing an anti-greenhouse effect that would lower the Earth's surface temperature. The severity of this cooling in Alan Robock's model suggests that the cumulative products of 100 of these firestorms could cool the global climate by approximately 1 °C (1.8 °F), largely eliminating the magnitude of anthropogenic global warming for two to three years. Robock has not modeled this, but has speculated that it would have global agricultural losses as a consequence.\n\nAs nuclear devices need not be detonated to ignite a firestorm, the term \"nuclear winter\" is something of a misnomer. The majority of papers published on the subject state that without qualitative justification, nuclear explosions are the cause of the modeled firestorm effects. The only phenomenon that is modeled by computer in the nuclear winter papers is the climate forcing agent of firestorm-soot, a product which can be ignited and formed by a myriad of means. Although rarely discussed, the proponents of the hypothesis state that the same \"nuclear winter\" effect would occur if 100 conventional firestorms were ignited.\n\nA much larger number of firestorms, in the thousands, was the initial assumption of the computer modelers who coined the term in the 1980s. These were speculated to be a possible result of any large scale employment of counter-value airbursting nuclear weapon use during an American-Soviet total war. This larger number of firestorms, which are not in themselves modeled, are presented as causing nuclear winter conditions as a result of the smoke inputted into various climate models, with the depths of severe cooling lasting for as long as a decade. During this period, summer drops in average temperature could be up to 20 °C (36 °F) in core agricultural regions of the US, Europe, and China, and as much as 35 °C (63 °F) in Russia. This cooling would be produced due to a 99% reduction in the natural solar radiation reaching the surface of the planet in the first few years, gradually clearing over the course of several decades.\n\nOn the fundamental level, since the advent of photographic evidence of tall clouds were captured, it was known that firestorms could inject soot smoke/aerosols into the stratosphere but the longevity of this slew of aerosols was a major unknown. Independent of the team that continue to publish theoretical models on nuclear winter, in 2006, Mike Fromm of the Naval Research Laboratory, experimentally found that each natural occurrence of a massive wildfire firestorm, much larger than that observed at Hiroshima, can produce minor \"nuclear winter\" effects, with short-lived, approximately one month of a nearly immeasurable drop in surface temperatures, confined to the hemisphere that they burned in. This is somewhat analogous to the frequent volcanic eruptions that inject sulfates into the stratosphere and thereby produce minor, even negligible, volcanic winter effects.\n\nA suite of satellite and aircraft-based firestorm-soot-monitoring instruments are at the forefront of attempts to accurately determine the lifespan, quantity, injection height, and optical properties of this smoke. Information regarding all of these properties is necessary to truly ascertain the length and severity of the cooling effect of firestorms, independent of the nuclear winter computer model projections.\n\nPresently, from satellite tracking data, stratospheric smoke aerosols dissipate in a time span under approximately two months. The existence of any hint of a tipping point into a new stratospheric condition where the aerosols would not be removed within this time frame remains to be determined.\n\nThe nuclear winter scenario assumes that 100 or more city firestorms are ignited by nuclear explosions, and that the firestorms lifts large amounts of sooty smoke into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere by the movement offered by the pyrocumulonimbus clouds that form during a firestorm. At above the Earth's surface, the absorption of sunlight could further heat the soot in the smoke, lifting some or all of it into the stratosphere, where the smoke could persist for years if there is no rain to wash it out. This aerosol of particles could heat the stratosphere and prevent a portion of the sun's light from reaching the surface, causing surface temperatures to drop drastically. In this scenario it is predicted that surface air temperatures would be the same as, or colder than, a given region's winter for months to years on end.\n\nThe modeled stable inversion layer of hot soot between the troposphere and high stratosphere that produces the anti-greenhouse effect was dubbed the \"Smokeosphere\" by Stephen Schneider et al. in their 1988 paper.\n\nAlthough it is common in the climate models to consider city firestorms, these need not be ignited by nuclear devices; more conventional ignition sources can instead be the spark of the firestorms. Prior to the previously mentioned solar heating effect, the soot's injection height is controlled by the rate of energy release from the firestorm's fuel, not the size of an initial nuclear explosion. For example, the mushroom cloud from the bomb dropped on Hiroshima reached a height of six kilometers (middle troposphere) within a few minutes and then dissipated due to winds, while the individual fires within the city took almost three hours to form into a firestorm and produce a pyrocumulus cloud, a cloud that is assumed to have reached upper tropospheric heights, as over its multiple hours of burning, the firestorm released an estimated 1000 times the energy of the bomb.\n\nAs the incendiary effects of a nuclear explosion do not present any especially characteristic features, it is estimated by those with Strategic bombing experience that as the city was a firestorm hazard, the same fire ferocity and building damage produced at Hiroshima by one 16-kiloton nuclear bomb from a single B-29 bomber could have been produced instead by the conventional use of about 1.2 kilotons of incendiary bombs from 220 B-29s distributed over the city.\n\nWhile the firestorms of Dresden and Hiroshima and the mass fires of Tokyo and Nagasaki occurred within mere months in 1945, the more intense and conventionally lit Hamburg firestorm occurred in 1943. Despite the separation in time, ferocity and area burned, leading modelers of the hypothesis state that these five fires potentially placed five percent as much smoke into the stratosphere as the hypothetical 100 nuclear-ignited fires discussed in modern models. While it is believed that the modeled climate-cooling-effects from the mass of soot injected into the stratosphere by 100 firestorms (one to five teragrams) would have been detectable with technical instruments in WWII, five percent of that would not have been possible to observe at that time.\n\nThe exact timescale for how long this smoke remains, and thus how severely this smoke affects the climate once it reaches the stratosphere, is dependent on both chemical and physical removal processes.\n\nThe most important physical removal mechanism is \"rainout\", both during the \"fire-driven convective column\" phase, which produces \"black rain\" near the fire site, and rainout after the convective plume's dispersal, where the smoke is no longer concentrated and thus \"wet removal\" is believed to be very efficient. However, these efficient removal mechanisms in the troposphere are avoided in the Robock 2007 study, where solar heating is modeled to quickly loft the soot into the stratosphere, \"detraining\" or separating the darker soot particles from the fire clouds' whiter water condensation.\n\nOnce in the stratosphere, the physical removal mechanisms affecting the timescale of the soot particles' residence are how quickly the aerosol of soot collides and coagulates with other particles via Brownian motion, and falls out of the atmosphere via gravity-driven dry deposition, and the time it takes for the \"phoretic effect\" to move coagulated particles to a lower level in the atmosphere. Whether by coagulation or the phoretic effect, once the aerosol of smoke particles are at this lower atmospheric level, cloud seeding can begin, permitting precipitation to wash the smoke aerosol out of the atmosphere by the wet deposition mechanism.\n\nThe chemical processes that affect the removal are dependent on the ability of atmospheric chemistry to oxidize the carbonaceous component of the smoke, via reactions with oxidative species such as ozone and nitrogen oxides, both of which are found at all levels of the atmosphere, and which also occur at greater concentrations when air is heated to high temperatures.\n\nHistorical data on residence times of aerosols, albeit a different mixture of aerosols, in this case stratospheric sulfur aerosols and volcanic ash from megavolcano eruptions, appear to be in the one-to-two-year time scale, however aerosol–atmosphere interactions are still poorly understood.\n\nSooty aerosols can have a wide range of properties, as well as complex shapes, making it difficult to determine their evolving atmospheric optical depth value. The conditions present during the creation of the soot are believed to be considerably important as to their final properties, with soot generated on the more efficient spectrum of burning efficiency considered almost \"elemental carbon black,\" while on the more inefficient end of the burning spectrum, greater quantities of partially burnt/oxidized fuel are present. These partially burnt \"organics\" as they are known, often form tar balls and brown carbon during common lower-intensity wildfires, and can also coat the purer black carbon particles. However, as the soot of greatest importance is that which is injected to the highest altitudes by the pyroconvection of the firestorm – a fire being fed with storm-force winds of air – it is estimated that the majority of the soot under these conditions is the more oxidized black carbon.\n\nA study presented at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December 2006 found that even a small-scale, regional nuclear war could disrupt the global climate for a decade or more. In a regional nuclear conflict scenario where two opposing nations in the subtropics would each use 50 Hiroshima-sized nuclear weapons (about 15 kiloton each) on major population centers, the researchers estimated as much as five million tons of soot would be released, which would produce a cooling of several degrees over large areas of North America and Eurasia, including most of the grain-growing regions. The cooling would last for years, and, according to the research, could be \"catastrophic\".\n\nA 2008 study by Michael J. Mills et al., published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that a nuclear weapons exchange between Pakistan and India using their current arsenals could create a near-global ozone hole, triggering human health problems and causing environmental damage for at least a decade. The computer-modeled study looked at a nuclear war between the two countries involving 50 Hiroshima-sized nuclear devices on each side, producing massive urban fires and lofting as much as five million metric tons of soot about into the mesosphere. The soot would absorb enough solar radiation to heat surrounding gases, causing a series of surface chemistry reactions that would break down the stratospheric ozone layer protecting Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.\n\nA \"nuclear summer\" is a hypothesized scenario in which, after a nuclear winter has abated, a greenhouse effect then occurs due to carbon dioxide released by combustion and methane released from the decay of the organic matter that froze during the nuclear winter.\n\nIn 1952, a few weeks prior to the Ivy Mike (10.4 megaton) bomb test on Elugelab island, there were concerns that the aerosols lifted by the explosion might cool the Earth. Major Norair Lulejian, USAF, and astronomer Natarajan Visvanathan, studied this possibility, reporting their findings in \"Effects of Superweapons Upon the Climate of the World\". According to a document by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency\", this report was the initial study of the \"nuclear winter\" concept that was popularized by others decades later. It indicated no appreciable chance of explosion-induced climate change.\n\nFollowing numerous surface bursts of high yield Hydrogen bomb explosions on Pacific Proving Ground islands such as those of Ivy Mike in 1952 and Castle Bravo (15 Mt) in 1954, \"The Effects of Nuclear Weapons\" by Samuel Glasstone was published in 1957, containing a section entitled \"Nuclear Bombs and the Weather\", which states: \"The dust raised in severe volcanic eruptions, such as that at Krakatoa in 1883, is known to cause a noticeable reduction in the sunlight reaching the earth … The amount of [soil or other surface] debris remaining in the atmosphere after the explosion of even the largest nuclear weapons is probably not more than about 1 percent or so of that raised by the Krakatoa eruption. Further, solar radiation records reveal that none of the nuclear explosions to date has resulted in any detectable change in the direct sunlight recorded on the ground.\" The US Weather Bureau in 1956 regarded it as conceivable that a large enough nuclear war with megaton-range surface detonations could lift enough soil to cause a new ice age.\n\nIn the 1966 RAND corporation memorandum \"The Effects of Nuclear War on the Weather and Climate\" by E. S. Batten, while primarily analysing potential dust effects from surface bursts, it notes that \"in addition to the effects of the debris, extensive fires ignited by nuclear detonations might change the surface characteristics of the area and modify local weather patterns ... however, a more thorough knowledge of the atmosphere is necessary to determine their exact nature, extent, and magnitude.\"\n\nIn the United States National Research Council (NRC) book \"Long-Term Worldwide Effects of Multiple Nuclear-Weapons Detonations\" published in 1975 it states that a nuclear war involving 4,000 Mt from \"present arsenals\" would probably deposit much less dust in the stratosphere than the Krakatoa eruption, judging that the effect of dust and oxides of nitrogen would probably be slight climatic cooling which \"would probably lie within normal global climatic variability, but the possibility of climatic changes of a more dramatic nature cannot be ruled out\".\n\nIn the 1985 report \"The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange\", the Committee on the Atmospheric Effects of Nuclear Explosions argues that a \"plausible\" estimate on the amount of stratospheric dust injected following a surface burst of 1 Mt is 0.3 teragrams, of which 8 percent would be in the micrometer range. The potential cooling from soil dust was again looked at in 1992, in a US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on geoengineering, which estimated that about 10 kg (100 teragrams) of stratospheric injected soil dust with particulate grain dimensions of 0.1 to 1 micrometer would be required to mitigate the warming from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, that is, to produce ~2 °C of cooling.\n\nIn 1969, Paul Crutzen discovered that oxides of nitrogen (NOx) could be an efficient catalyst for the destruction of the ozone layer/stratospheric ozone. Following studies on the potential effects of NOx generated by engine heat in stratosphere flying Supersonic Transport (SST) airplanes in the 1970s, in 1974, John Hampson suggested in the journal \"Nature\" that due to the creation of atmospheric NOx by nuclear fireballs, a full-scale nuclear exchange could result in depletion of the ozone shield, possibly subjecting the earth to ultraviolet radiation for a year or more. In 1975, Hampson's hypothesis \"led directly\" to the United States National Research Council (NRC) reporting on the models of ozone depletion following nuclear war in the book \"Long-Term Worldwide Effects of Multiple Nuclear-Weapons Detonations\".\n\nIn the section of this 1975 NRC book pertaining to the issue of fireball generated NOx and ozone layer loss therefrom, the NRC present model calculations from the early-to-mid 1970s on the effects of a nuclear war with the use of large numbers of multi-megaton yield detonations, which returned conclusions that this could reduce ozone levels by 50 percent or more in the northern hemisphere.\n\nHowever independent of the computer models presented in the 1975 NRC works, a paper in 1973 in the journal \"Nature\" depicts the stratospheric ozone levels worldwide overlaid upon the number of nuclear detonations during the era of atmospheric testing. The authors conclude that neither the data nor their models show any correlation between the approximate 500 Mt in historical atmospheric testing and an increase or decrease of ozone concentration. In 1976, a study on the experimental measurements of an earlier atmospheric nuclear test as it affected the ozone layer also found that nuclear detonations are exonerated of depleting ozone, after the at first alarming model calculations of the time. Similarly, a 1981 paper found that the models on ozone destruction from one test and the physical measurements taken were in disagreement, as no destruction was observed.\n\nIn total about 500 Mt were atmospherically detonated between 1945 and 1971, peaking in 1961–62, when 340 Mt were detonated in the atmosphere by the United States and Soviet Union. During this peak, with the multi-megaton range detonations of the two nations nuclear test series, in exclusive examination, a total yield estimated at 300 Mt of energy was released. Due to this, 3 × 10 additional molecules of nitric oxide (about 5,000 tons per Mt, 5 × 10 grams per megaton) are believed to have entered the stratosphere, and while ozone depletion of 2.2 percent was noted in 1963, the decline had started prior to 1961 and is believed to have been caused by other meteorological effects.\n\nIn 1982 journalist Jonathan Schell in his popular and influential book \"The Fate of the Earth\", introduced the public to the belief that fireball generated NOx would destroy the ozone layer to such and extent that crops would fail from solar UV radiation and then similarly painted the fate of the Earth, as plant and aquatic life going extinct. In the same year, of 1982, Australian physicist Brian Martin, who frequently corresponded with John Hampson who had been greatly responsible for much of the examination of NOx generation, penned a short historical synopsis on the history of interest in the effects of the direct NOx generated by nuclear fireballs, and in doing so, also outlined Hampson's other non-mainstream viewpoints, particularly those relating to greater ozone destruction from upper-atmospheric detonations as a result of any widely used anti-ballistic missile (ABM-1 Galosh) system. However, Martin ultimately concludes that it is \"unlikely that in the context of a major nuclear war\" ozone degradation would be of serious concern. Martin describes views about potential ozone loss and therefore increases in ultraviolet light leading to the widespread destruction of crops, as advocated by journalist Jonathan Schell in\"The Fate of the Earth\", as highly unlikely.\n\nMore recent accounts on the specific ozone layer destruction potential of NOx species are much less than earlier assumed from simplistic calculations, as \"about 1.2 million tons\" of natural and anthropogenic generated stratospheric NOx is believed to be formed each year according to Robert P. Parson in the 1990s.\n\nThe first published suggestion that a cooling of climate could be an effect of a nuclear war, appears to have been originally put forth by Poul Anderson and F.N. Waldrop in their post-war story \"Tomorrow's Children\", in the March 1947 issue of the \"Astounding Science Fiction\" magazine. The story, primarily about a team of scientists hunting down mutants, warns of a \"Fimbulwinter\" caused by dust that blocked sunlight after a recent nuclear war and speculated that it may even trigger a new Ice Age. Anderson went on to publish a novel based partly on this story in 1961 titling it \"Twilight World\". Similarly in 1985 it was noted by T. G. Parsons that the story \"Torch\" by C. Anvil, which also appeared in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" magazine, but in the April 1957 edition, contains the essence of the \"Twilight at Noon\"/\"nuclear winter\" hypothesis. In the story a nuclear warhead ignites an oil field, and the soot produced \"screens out part of the sun's radiation\", resulting in Arctic temperatures for much of the population of North America and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe 1988 Air Force Geophysics Laboratory publication \"An assessment of global atmospheric effects of a major nuclear war\" by H. S. Muench et al. contains a chronology and review of the major reports on the nuclear winter hypothesis from 1983–86. In general these reports arrive at similar conclusions as they are based on \"the same assumptions, the same basic data\", with only minor model-code differences. They skip the modeling steps of assessing the possibility of fire and the initial fire plumes and instead start the modeling process with a \"spatially uniform soot cloud\" which has found its way into the atmosphere.\n\nAlthough never openly acknowledged by the multi-disciplinary team who authored the most popular 1980s TTAPS model, in 2011 the American Institute of Physics states that the TTAPS team (named for its participants, who had all previously worked on the phenomenon of dust storms on Mars, or in the area of asteroid impact events: Richard P. Turco, Owen Toon, Thomas P. Ackerman, James B. Pollack and Carl Sagan) announcement of their results in 1983 \"was with the explicit aim of promoting international arms control\". However, \"the computer models were so simplified, and the data on smoke and other aerosols were still so poor, that the scientists could say nothing for certain.\"\n\nIn 1981, William J. Moran began discussions and research in the National Research Council (NRC) on the airborne soil/dust effects of a large exchange of nuclear warheads, having seen a possible parallel in the dust effects of a war with that of the asteroid-created K-T boundary and its popular analysis a year earlier by Luis Alvarez in 1980. An NRC study panel on the topic met in December 1981 and April 1982 in preparation for the release of the NRC's \"The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange\", published in 1985.\n\nAs part of a study on the creation of oxidizing species such as NOx and ozone in the troposphere after a nuclear war, launched in 1980 by \"AMBIO\", a journal of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Paul J. Crutzen and John Birks began preparing for the 1982 publication of a calculation on the effects of nuclear war on stratospheric ozone, using the latest models of the time. However they found that in part as a result of the trend towards more numerous but less energetic, sub-megaton range nuclear warheads (made possible by the ceaseless march to increase ICBM warhead accuracy/Circular Error Probable), the ozone layer danger was \"not very significant\".\n\nIt was after being confronted with these results that they \"chanced\" upon the notion, as \"an afterthought\" of nuclear detonations igniting massive fires everywhere and, crucially, the smoke from these conventional fires then going on to absorb sunlight, causing surface temperatures to plummet. In early 1982, the two circulated a draft paper with the first suggestions of alterations in short-term climate from fires presumed to occur following a nuclear war. Later in the same year, the special issue of \"Ambio\" devoted to the possible environmental consequences of nuclear war by Crutzen and Birks was titled \"Twilight at Noon\", and largely anticipated the nuclear winter hypothesis. The paper looked into fires and their climatic effect and discussed particulate matter from large fires, nitrogen oxide, ozone depletion and the effect of nuclear twilight on agriculture. Crutzen and Birks' calculations suggested that smoke particulates injected into the atmosphere by fires in cities, forests and petroleum reserves could prevent up to 99% of sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface. This darkness, they said, could exist \"for as long as the fires burned\", which was assumed to be many weeks, with effects such as: \"The normal dynamic and temperature structure of the atmosphere would ... change considerably over a large fraction of the Northern Hemisphere, which will probably lead to important changes in land surface temperatures and wind systems.\" An implication of their work was that a successful nuclear decapitation strike could have severe climatic consequences for the perpetrator.\n\nAfter reading a paper by N. P. Bochkov and E. I. Chazov, published in the same edition of \"Ambio\" that carried Crutzen and Birks's paper \"Twilight at Noon\", Soviet atmospheric scientist Georgy Golitsyn applied his research on Mars dust storms to soot in the Earth's atmosphere. The use of these influential Martian dust storm models in nuclear winter research began in 1971, when the Soviet spacecraft Mars 2 arrived at the red planet and observed a global dust cloud. The orbiting instruments together with the 1971 Mars 3 lander determined that temperatures on the surface of the red-planet were considerably colder than temperatures at the top of the dust cloud. Following these observations, Golitsyn received two telegrams from astronomer Carl Sagan, in which Sagan asked Golitsyn to \"explore the understanding and assessment of this phenomenon.\" Golitsyn recounts that it was around this time that he had \"proposed a theory to explain how Martian dust may be formed and how it may reach global proportions.\"\n\nIn the same year Alexander Ginzburg, an employee in Golitsyn's institute, developed a model of dust storms to describe the cooling phenomenon on Mars. Golitsyn felt that his model would be applicable to soot after he read a 1982 Swedish magazine dedicated to the effects of a hypothetical nuclear war between the USSR and the US. Golitsyn would use Ginzburg's largely unmodified dust-cloud model with soot assumed as the aerosol in the model instead of soil dust and in an identical fashion to the results returned, when computing dust-cloud cooling in the Martian atmosphere, the cloud high above the planet would be heated while the planet below would cool drastically. Golitsyn presented his intent to publish this Martian derived Earth-analog model to the Andropov instigated \"Committee of Soviet Scientists in Defence of Peace Against the Nuclear Threat\" in May 1983, an organization that Golitsyn would later be appointed a position of vice-chairman of. The establishment of this committee was done with the expressed approval of the Soviet leadership with the intent \"to expand controlled contacts with Western \"nuclear freeze\" activists\". Having gained this committees approval, in September 1983, Golitsyn published the first computer model on the nascent \"nuclear winter\" effect in the widely read \"Herald of the Russian Academy of Sciences\".\n\nOn 31 October 1982, Golitsyn and Ginsburg's model and results were presented at the conference on \"The World after Nuclear War\", hosted in Washington, D.C.\n\nBoth Golitsyn and Sagan had been interested in the cooling on the dust storms on the planet Mars in the years preceding their focus on \"nuclear winter\". Sagan had also worked on Project A119 in the 1950s–60s, in which he attempted to model the movement and longevity of a plume of lunar soil.\n\nAfter the publication of \"Twilight at Noon\" in 1982, the TTAPS team have said that they began the process of doing a 1-dimensional computational modeling study of the atmospheric consequences of nuclear war/soot in the stratosphere, though they would not publish a paper in \"Science\" magazine until late December 1983. The phrase \"nuclear winter\" had been coined by Turco just prior to publication. In this early paper, TTAPS used assumption based estimates on the total smoke and dust emissions that would result from a major nuclear exchange, and with that, began analyzing the subsequent effects on the atmospheric radiation balance and temperature structure as a result of this quantity of assumed smoke. To compute dust and smoke effects, they employed a one-dimensional microphysics/radiative-transfer model of the Earth's lower atmosphere (up to the mesopause), which defined only the vertical characteristics of the global climate perturbation.\n\nInterest in the environmental effects of nuclear war, however, had continued in the Soviet Union after Golitsyn's September paper, with Vladimir Alexandrov and G. I. Stenchikov also publishing a paper in December 1983 on the climatic consequences, although in contrast to the contemporary TTAPS paper, this paper was based on simulations with a three-dimensional global circulation model. (Two years later Alexandrov disappeared under mysterious circumstances). Richard Turco and Starley L. Thompson were both critical of the Soviet research. Turco called it \"primitive\" and Thompson said it used obsolete US computer models. Later they were to rescind these criticisms and instead applauded Alexandrov's pioneering work, saying that the Soviet model shared the weaknesses of all the others.\n\nIn 1984, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) commissioned Golitsyn and N. A. Phillips to review the state of the science. They found that studies generally assumed a scenario where half of the world's nuclear weapons would be used, ~5000 Mt, destroying approximately 1,000 cities, and creating large quantities of carbonaceous smoke – 1– being most likely, with a range of 0.2– (NAS; TTAPS assumed ). The smoke resulting would be largely opaque to solar radiation but transparent to infrared, thus cooling the Earth by blocking sunlight, but not creating warming by enhancing the greenhouse effect. The optical depth of the smoke can be much greater than unity. Forest fires resulting from non-urban targets could increase aerosol production further. Dust from near-surface explosions against hardened targets also contributes; each megaton-equivalent explosion could release up to 5 million tons of dust, but most would quickly fall out; high altitude dust is estimated at 0.1–1 million tons per megaton-equivalent of explosion. Burning of crude oil could also contribute substantially.\n\nThe 1-D radiative-convective models used in these studies produced a range of results, with coolings up to 15–42 °C between 14 and 35 days after the war, with a \"baseline\" of about 20 °C. Somewhat more sophisticated calculations using 3-D GCMs produced similar results: temperature drops of about 20 °C, though with regional variations.\n\nAll calculations show large heating (up to 80 °C) at the top of the smoke layer at about ; this implies a substantial modification of the circulation there and the possibility of advection of the cloud into low latitudes and the southern hemisphere.\n\nIn a 1990 paper entitled \"Climate and Smoke: An Appraisal of Nuclear Winter\", TTAPS gave a more detailed description of the short- and long-term atmospheric effects of a nuclear war using a three-dimensional model:\n\nFirst 1 to 3 months:\n\nFollowing 1 to 3 years:\n\nOne of the major results of TTAPS' 1990 paper was the re-iteration of the team's 1983 model that 100 oil refinery fires would be sufficient to bring about a small scale, but still globally deleterious nuclear winter.\n\nFollowing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and Iraqi threats of igniting the country's approximately 800 oil wells, speculation on the cumulative climatic effect of this, presented at the World Climate Conference in Geneva that November in 1990, ranged from a nuclear winter type scenario, to heavy acid rain and even short term immediate global warming.\n\nIn articles printed in the \"Wilmington Morning Star\" and the \"Baltimore Sun\" newspapers in January 1991, prominent authors of nuclear winter papers – Richard P. Turco, John W. Birks, Carl Sagan, Alan Robock and Paul Crutzen – collectively stated that they expected catastrophic nuclear winter like effects with continental-sized effects of sub-freezing temperatures as a result of the Iraqis going through with their threats of igniting 300 to 500 pressurized oil wells that could subsequently burn for several months.\n\nAs threatened, the wells were set on fire by the retreating Iraqis in March 1991, and the 600 or so burning oil wells were not fully extinguished until November 6, 1991, eight months after the end of the war, and they consumed an estimated six million barrels of oil per day at their peak intensity.\n\nWhen Operation Desert Storm begun in January 1991, coinciding with the first few oil fires being lit, Dr. S. Fred Singer and Carl Sagan discussed the possible environmental effects of the Kuwaiti petroleum fires on the ABC News program \"Nightline\". Sagan again argued that some of the effects of the smoke could be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter, with smoke lofting into the stratosphere, beginning around above sea level in Kuwait, resulting in global effects. He also argued that he believed the net effects would be very similar to the explosion of the Indonesian volcano Tambora in 1815, which resulted in the year 1816 being known as the \"Year Without a Summer\".\n\nSagan listed modeling outcomes that forecast effects extending to South Asia, and perhaps to the Northern Hemisphere as well. Sagan stressed this outcome was so likely that \"It should affect the war plans.\" Singer, on the other hand, anticipated that the smoke would go to an altitude of about and then be rained out after about three to five days, thus limiting the lifetime of the smoke. Both height estimates made by Singer and Sagan turned out to be wrong, albeit with Singer's narrative being closer to what transpired, with the comparatively minimal atmospheric effects remaining limited to the Persian Gulf region, with smoke plumes, in general, lofting to about and a few as high as .\n\nSagan and his colleagues expected that a \"self-lofting\" of the sooty smoke would occur when it absorbed the sun's heat radiation, with little to no scavenging occurring, whereby the black particles of soot would be heated by the sun and lifted/lofted higher and higher into the air, thereby injecting the soot into the stratosphere, a position where they argued it would take years for the sun blocking effect of this aerosol of soot to fall out of the air, and with that, catastrophic ground level cooling and agricultural effects in Asia and possibly the Northern Hemisphere as a whole. In a 1992 follow-up, Peter Hobbs and others had observed no appreciable evidence for the nuclear winter team's predicted massive \"self-lofting\" effect and the oil-fire smoke clouds contained less soot than the nuclear winter modelling team had assumed.\n\nThe atmospheric scientist tasked with studying the atmospheric effect of the Kuwaiti fires by the National Science Foundation, Peter Hobbs, stated that the fires' modest impact suggested that \"some numbers [used to support the Nuclear Winter hypothesis]... were probably a little overblown.\"\n\nHobbs found that at the peak of the fires, the smoke absorbed 75 to 80% of the sun's radiation. The particles rose to a maximum of , and when combined with scavenging by clouds the smoke had a short residency time of a maximum of a few days in the atmosphere.\n\nPre-War claims of wide scale, long-lasting, and significant global environmental effects were thus not borne out, and found to be significantly exaggerated by the media and speculators, with climate models by those not supporting the nuclear winter hypothesis at the time of the fires predicting only more localized effects such as a daytime temperature drop of ~10 °C within 200 km of the source.\n\nSagan later conceded in his book \"The Demon-Haunted World\" that his predictions obviously did not turn out to be correct: \"it \"was\" pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4–6 °C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared.\"\n\nThe idea of oil well and oil reserve smoke pluming into the stratosphere serving as a main contributor to the soot of a nuclear winter was a central idea of the early climatology papers on the hypothesis; they were considered more of a possible contributor than smoke from cities, as the smoke from oil has a higher ratio of black soot, thus absorbing more sunlight. Hobbs compared the papers' assumed \"emission factor\" or soot generating efficiency from ignited oil pools and found, upon comparing to measured values from oil pools at Kuwait, which were the greatest soot producers, the emissions of soot assumed in the nuclear winter calculations were still \"too high\". Following the results of the Kuwaiti oil fires being in disagreement with the core nuclear winter promoting scientists, 1990s nuclear winter papers generally attempted to distance themselves from suggesting oil well and reserve smoke will reach the stratosphere.\n\nIn 2007, a nuclear winter study, noted that modern computer models have been applied to the Kuwait oil fires, finding that individual smoke plumes are not able to loft smoke into the stratosphere, but that smoke from fires covering a large area like some forest fires can lift smoke into the stratosphere, and recent evidence suggests that this occurs far more often than previously thought. The study also suggested that the burning of the comparably smaller cities, which would be expected to follow a nuclear strike, would also loft significant amounts of smoke into the stratosphere:\n\nHowever the above simulation notably contained the assumption that no dry or wet deposition would occur.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2003, commentators noted that no peer-reviewed papers on \"nuclear winter\" were published.\n\nBased on new work published in 2007 and 2008 by some of the authors of the original studies, several new hypotheses have been put forth, primarily the assessment that as few as 100 firestorms would result in a nuclear winter. However far from the hypothesis being \"new\", it drew the same conclusion as earlier 1980s models, which similarly regarded 100 or so city firestorms as a threat.\n\nA minor nuclear war with each country using 50 Hiroshima-sized atom bombs as air-bursts on urban areas could produce climate change unprecedented in recorded human history. A nuclear war between the United States and Russia today could produce nuclear winter, with temperatures plunging below freezing in the summer in major agricultural regions, threatening the food supply for most of the planet. The climatic effects of the smoke from burning cities and industrial areas would last for several years, much longer than previously thought. New climate model simulations, which are said to have the capability of including the entire atmosphere and oceans, show that the smoke would be lofted by solar heating to the upper stratosphere, where it would remain for years.\n\nCompared to climate change for the past millennium, even the smallest exchange modeled would plunge the planet into temperatures colder than the Little Ice Age (the period of history between approximately 1600 and 1850 AD). This would take effect instantly, and agriculture would be severely threatened. Larger amounts of smoke would produce larger climate changes, and for the 150 teragrams (Tg) producing a true nuclear winter (1 Tg is 10 grams), making agriculture impossible for years. In both cases, new climate model simulations show that the effects would last for more than a decade.\n\nA study published in the \"Journal of Geophysical Research\" in July 2007, titled \"Nuclear winter revisited with a modern climate model and current nuclear arsenals: Still catastrophic consequences\", used current climate models to look at the consequences of a global nuclear war involving most or all of the world's current nuclear arsenals (which the authors judged to be one similar to the size of the world's arsenals twenty years earlier). The authors used a global circulation model, ModelE from the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which they noted \"has been tested extensively in global warming experiments and to examine the effects of volcanic eruptions on climate.\" The model was used to investigate the effects of a war involving the entire current global nuclear arsenal, projected to release about 150 Tg of smoke into the atmosphere, as well as a war involving about one third of the current nuclear arsenal, projected to release about 50 Tg of smoke. In the 150 Tg case they found that:\n\nIn addition, they found that this cooling caused a weakening of the global hydrological cycle, reducing global precipitation by about 45%. As for the 50 Tg case involving one third of current nuclear arsenals, they said that the simulation \"produced climate responses very similar to those for the 150 Tg case, but with about half the amplitude,\" but that \"the time scale of response is about the same.\" They did not discuss the implications for agriculture in depth, but noted that a 1986 study which assumed no food production for a year projected that \"most of the people on the planet would run out of food and starve to death by then\" and commented that their own results show that, \"This period of no food production needs to be extended by many years, making the impacts of nuclear winter even worse than previously thought.\"\n\nIn 2014, Michael J. Mills (at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, NCAR) et al. published \"Multi-decadal global cooling and unprecedented ozone loss following a regional nuclear conflict\" in the journal \"Earth's Future\". The authors used computational models developed by NCAR to simulate the climatic effects of a soot cloud that they suggest would be a result, of a regional nuclear war in which 100 \"small\" (15 Kt) weapons are detonated over cities. The model had outputs, due to the interaction of the soot cloud:\n\nglobal ozone losses of 20–50% over populated areas, levels unprecedented in human history, would accompany the coldest average surface temperatures in the last 1000 years. We calculate summer enhancements in UV indices of 30–80% over Mid-Latitudes, suggesting widespread damage to human health, agriculture, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Killing frosts would reduce growing seasons by 10–40 days per year for 5 years. Surface temperatures would be reduced for more than 25 years, due to thermal inertia and albedo effects in the ocean and expanded sea ice. The combined cooling and enhanced UV would put significant pressures on global food supplies and could trigger a global nuclear famine.\n\nResearch published in the peer-reviewed journal \"Safety\" suggested that no nation should possess more than 100 nuclear warheads because of the blowback effect on the aggressor nation's own population because of \"nuclear autumn\".\n\nThe four major, largely independent underpinnings that the nuclear winter concept has and continues to receive criticism over, are regarded as: firstly, would cities readily firestorm, and if so how much soot would be generated. Secondly, \"atmospheric\" longevity; would the quantities of soot assumed in the models remain in the atmosphere for as long as projected or would far more soot precipitate as black rain much sooner. Third, \"timing\" of events; how realistic is it to start the firestorms or war modelling in late spring or summer, which almost all US-Soviet winter papers assume, so as to depict the maximum possible cooling results. Lastly, the issue of \"darkness or opacity\"; how much light-blocking effect the assumed quality of the soot reaching the atmosphere would have.\n\nWhile the highly popularized initial 1983 TTAPS 1-dimensional model forecasts were widely reported and criticized in the media, in part because every later model predicts far less of its \"apocalyptic\" level of cooling, most models continue to suggest that some deleterious global cooling would still result, under the assumption that a large number of fires occurred in the spring or summer. Starley L. Thompson's less primitive mid-1980s 3-Dimensional model, which notably contained the very same general assumptions, led him to coin the term \"nuclear autumn\" to more accurately describe the climate results of the soot in this model, in an on camera interview in which he dismisses the earlier \"apocalyptic\" models.\n\nA major criticism of the assumptions that continue to make these model results possible appeared in the 1987 book \"Nuclear War Survival Skills\" (\"NWSS\"), a civil defense manual by Cresson Kearny for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. According to the 1988 publication \"An assessment of global atmospheric effects of a major nuclear war\", Kearny's criticisms were directed at the excessive amount of soot that the modelers assumed would reach the stratosphere. Kearny cited a Soviet study that modern cities would not burn as firestorms, as most flammable city items would be buried under non-combustible rubble and that the TTAPS study included a massive overestimate on the size and extent of non-urban wildfires that would result from a nuclear war. The TTAPS authors responded that, amongst other things, they did not believe target planners would intentionally blast cities into rubble, but instead argued fires would begin in relatively undamaged suburbs when nearby sites were hit, and partially conceded his point about non-urban wildfires. Dr. Richard D. Small, director of thermal sciences at the Pacific-Sierra Research Corporation similarly disagreed strongly with the model assumptions, in particular the 1990 update by TTAPS that argues that some 5,075 Tg of material would burn in a total US-Soviet nuclear war, as analysis by Small of blueprints and real buildings returned a maximum of 1,475 Tg of material that could be burned, \"assuming that all the available combustible material was actually ignited\".\n\nAlthough Kearny was of the opinion that future more accurate models would \"indicate there will be even smaller reductions in temperature\", including future potential models that did not so readily accept that firestorms would occur as dependably as nuclear winter modellers assume, in \"NWSS\" Kearny did summarize the comparatively moderate cooling estimate of no more than a few days, from the 1986 \"Nuclear Winter Reappraised\" model by Starley Thompson and Stephen Schneider. This was done in an effort to convey to his readers that contrary to the popular opinion at the time, in the conclusion of these two climate scientists, \"on scientific grounds the global apocalyptic conclusions of the initial nuclear winter hypothesis can now be relegated to a vanishing low level of probability.\"\n\nHowever while a 1988 article by Brian Martin in \"Science and Public Policy\" states that although \"Nuclear Winter Reappraised\" concluded the US-Soviet \"nuclear winter\" would be much less severe than originally thought, with the authors describing the effects more as a \"nuclear autumn\", other statements by Thompson and Schneider show that they \"resisted the interpretation that this means a rejection of the basic points made about nuclear winter\". In the Alan Robock et al. 2007 paper they write that \"because of the use of the term 'nuclear autumn' by Thompson and Schneider [1986], even though the authors made clear that the climatic consequences would be large, in policy circles the theory of nuclear winter is considered by some to have been exaggerated and disproved [e.g., Martin, 1988].\" In 2007 Schneider expressed his tentative support for the cooling results of the limited nuclear war (Pakistan and India) analyzed in the 2006 model, saying \"The sun is much stronger in the tropics than it is in mid-latitudes. Therefore, a much more limited war [there] could have a much larger effect, because you are putting the smoke in the worst possible place\", and \"anything that you can do to discourage people from thinking that there is any way to win anything with a nuclear exchange is a good idea.\"\n\nThe contribution of smoke from the ignition of live non-desert vegetation, living forests, grasses and so on, nearby to many missile silos is a source of smoke originally assumed to be very large in the initial \"Twilight at Noon\" paper, and also found in the popular TTAPS publication. However, this assumption was examined by Bush and Small in 1987 and they found that the burning of live vegetation could only conceivably contribute very slightly to the estimated total \"nonurban smoke production\". With the vegetation's potential to sustain burning only probable if it is within a radius or two from the surface of the nuclear fireball, which is at a distance that would also experience extreme blast winds that would influence any such fires. This reduction in the estimate of the non-urban smoke hazard is supported by the earlier preliminary \"Estimating Nuclear Forest Fires\" publication of 1984, and by the 1950–60s in-field examination of surface-scorched, mangled but never burnt-down tropical forests on the surrounding islands from the shot points in the Operation Castle, and Operation Redwing test series.\n\nA paper by the United States Department of Homeland Security, finalized in 2010, states that after a nuclear detonation targeting a city \"If fires are able to grow and coalesce, a firestorm could develop that would be beyond the abilities of firefighters to control. However experts suggest in the nature of modern US city design and construction may make a raging firestorm unlikely\". The nuclear bombing of Nagasaki for example, did not produce a firestorm. This was similarly noted as early as 1986–88, when the assumed quantity of fuel \"mass loading\" (the amount of fuel per square meter) in cities underpinning the winter models was found to be too high and intentionally creates heat fluxes that loft smoke into the lower stratosphere, yet assessments \"more characteristic of conditions\" to be found in real-world modern cities, had found that the fuel loading, and hence the heat flux that would result from efficient burning, would rarely loft smoke much higher than 4 km.\n\nRussell Seitz, Associate of the Harvard University Center for International Affairs, argues that the winter models' assumptions give results which the researchers want to achieve and is a case of \"worst-case analysis run amok\". In September 1986 Seitz published \"Siberian fire as 'nuclear winter' guide\" in the journal \"Nature\" in which he investigated the 1915 Siberian fire which started in the early summer months and was caused by the worst drought in the region's recorded history. The fire ultimately devastated the region burning the world's largest boreal forest, the size of Germany. While approximately 8 ˚C of daytime summer cooling occurred under the smoke clouds during the weeks of burning, no increase in potentially devastating agricultural night frosts occurred. Following his investigation into the Siberian fire of 1915, Seitz criticized the \"nuclear winter\" model results for being based on successive worst-case events: “The improbability of a string of 40 such coin tosses coming up heads approaches that of a pat royal flush. Yet it was represented as a \"sophisticated one-dimensional model\" – a usage that is oxymoronic, unless applied to [the British model Lesley Lawson] Twiggy.”\n\nSeitz cited Carl Sagan, adding an emphasis: \"\"In almost any realistic case\" involving nuclear exchanges between the superpowers, global environmental changes sufficient to cause an extinction event equal to or more severe than that of the close of the Cretaceous when the dinosaurs and many other species died out are likely.” Seitz comments: “The ominous rhetoric italicized in this passage puts even the 100 megaton [the original 100 city firestorm] scenario … on a par with the 100 million megaton blast of an asteroid striking the Earth. This [is] astronomical mega-hype …” Seitz concludes:\nSeitz's opposition caused the proponents of nuclear winter to issue responses in the media. The proponents believed it was simply necessary to show only the possibility of climatic catastrophe, often a worst-case scenario, while opponents insisted that to be taken seriously, nuclear winter should be shown as likely under \"reasonable\" scenarios. One of these areas of contention, as elucidated by Lynn R. Anspaugh, is upon the question of which season should be used as the backdrop for the US-USSR war models, as most models choose the summer in the Northern Hemisphere as the start point to produce the maximum soot lofting and therefore eventual winter effect, whereas it has been pointed out that if the firestorms occurred in the autumn or winter months, when there is much less intense sunlight to loft soot into a stable region of the stratosphere, the magnitude of the cooling effect from the same number of firestorms as ignited in the summer models, would be negligible according to a January model run by Covey et al. Schneider conceded the issue in 1990, saying \"a war in late fall or winter would have no appreciable [cooling] effect\".\n\nAnspaugh also expressed frustration that although a managed forest fire in Canada on 3 August 1985 is said to have been lit by proponents of nuclear winter, with the fire potentially serving as an opportunity to do some basic measurements of the optical properties of the smoke and smoke-to-fuel ratio, which would have helped refine the estimates of these critical model inputs, the proponents did not indicate that any such measurements were made. Peter V. Hobbs, who would later successfully attain funding to fly into and sample the smoke clouds from the Kuwait oil fires in 1991, also expressed frustration that he was denied funding to sample the Canadian, and other forest fires in this way. Turco wrote a 10-page memorandum with information derived from his notes and some satellite images, claiming that the smoke plume reached 6 km in altitude.\n\nIn 1986, atmospheric scientist Joyce Penner from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory published an article in \"Nature\" in which she focused on the specific variables of the smoke's optical properties and the quantity of smoke remaining airborne after the city fires and found that the published estimates of these variables varied so widely that depending on which estimates were chosen the climate effect could be negligible, minor or massive.\nThe assumed optical properties for black carbon in more recent nuclear winter papers in 2006 are still \"based on those assumed in earlier nuclear winter simulations\".\n\nJohn Maddox, editor of the journal \"Nature\", issued a series of skeptical comments about nuclear winter studies during his tenure. Similarly S. Fred Singer was a long term vocal critic of the hypothesis in the journal and in televised debates with Carl Sagan.\n\nIn a 2011 response to the more modern papers on the hypothesis, Russell Seitz published a comment in \"Nature\" challenging Alan Robock's claim that there has been no real scientific debate about the 'nuclear winter' concept. In 1986 Seitz also contends that many others are reluctant to speak out for fear of being stigmatized as \"closet Dr. Strangeloves\", physicist Freeman Dyson of Princeton for example stated \"It's an absolutely atrocious piece of science, but I quite despair of setting the public record straight.\" According to the Rocky Mountain News, Stephen Schneider had been called a fascist by some disarmament supporters for having written his 1986 article \"Nuclear Winter Reappraised.\" As MIT meteorologist Kerry Emanuel similarly wrote a review in \"Nature\" that the winter concept is “notorious for its lack of scientific integrity” due to the unrealistic estimates selected for the quantity of fuel likely to burn, the imprecise global circulation models used, and ends by stating that the evidence of other models, point to substantial scavenging of the smoke by rain. Emanuel also made an \"interesting point\" about questioning proponent's objectivity when it came to strong emotional or political issues that they hold.\n\nWilliam R. Cotton, Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, specialist in cloud physics modeling and co-creator of the highly influential, and previously mentioned RAMS atmosphere model, had in the 1980s worked on soot rain-out models and supported the predictions made by his own and other nuclear winter models, but has since reversed this position according to a book co-authored by him in 2007, stating that, amongst other systematically examined assumptions, far more rain out/wet deposition of soot will occur than is assumed in modern papers on the subject: \"We must wait for a new generation of GCMs to be implemented to examine potential consequences quantitatively\" and revealing that in his experience, \"nuclear winter was largely politically motivated from the beginning\".\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis, Fidel Castro and Che Guevara called on the USSR to launch a nuclear first strike against the US in the event of a US invasion of Cuba. In the 1980s Castro was pressuring the Kremlin to adopt a harder line against the US under President Ronald Reagan, even arguing for the potential use of nuclear weapons. As a direct result of this a Soviet official was dispatched to Cuba in 1985 with an entourage of \"experts\", who detailed the ecological effect on Cuba in the event of nuclear strikes on the United States. Soon after, the Soviet official recounts, Castro lost his prior \"nuclear fever\". In 2010 Alan Robock was summoned to Cuba to help Castro promote his new view that nuclear war would bring about Armageddon. Robock's 90 minute lecture was later aired on the nationwide state-controlled television station in the country.\n\nHowever, according to Robock, insofar as getting US government attention and affecting nuclear policy, he has failed. In 2009, together with Owen Toon, he gave a talk to the United States Congress but nothing transpired from it and the then presidential science adviser, John Holdren, did not respond to their requests in 2009 or at the time of writing in 2011.\nIn a 2012 \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" feature, Robock and Toon, who had routinely mixed their disarmament advocacy into the conclusions of their \"nuclear winter\" papers, argue in the political realm that the hypothetical effects of nuclear winter necessitates that the doctrine they assume is active in Russia and US, \"mutually assured destruction\" (MAD) should instead be replaced with their own \"self-assured destruction\" (SAD) concept, because, regardless of whose cities burned, the effects of the resultant nuclear winter that they advocate, would be, in their view, catastrophic. In a similar vein, in 1989 Carl Sagan and Richard Turco wrote a policy implications paper that appeared in \"AMBIO\" that suggested that as nuclear winter is a \"well-established prospect\", both superpowers should jointly reduce their nuclear arsenals to \"Canonical Deterrent Force\" levels of 100–300 individual warheads each, such that in \"the event of nuclear war [this] would minimize the likelihood of [extreme] nuclear winter.\"\n\nAn originally classified 1984 US interagency intelligence assessment states that in both the preceding 1970s and 80s, the Soviet and US military were already following the \"existing trends\" in warhead miniaturization, of higher accuracy and lower yield nuclear warheads, this is seen when assessing the most numerous physics packages in the US arsenal, which in the 1960s were the B28 and W31, however both quickly became less prominent with the 1970s mass production runs of the 50 Kt W68, the 100 Kt W76 and in the 1980s, with the B61. This trend towards miniaturization, enabled by advances in inertial guidance and accurate GPS navigation etc., was motivated by a multitude of factors, namely the desire to leverage the physics of equivalent megatonnage that miniaturization offered; of freeing up space to fit more MIRV warheads and decoys on each missile. Alongside the desire to still destroy hardened targets but while reducing the severity of fallout collateral damage depositing on neighboring, and potentially friendly, countries. As it relates to the likelihood of nuclear winter, the range of potential thermal radiation ignited fires was already reduced with miniaturization. For example, the most popular nuclear winter paper, the 1983 TTAPS paper, had described a 3000 Mt counterforce attack on ICBM sites with each individual warhead having approximately one Mt of energy; however not long after publication, Michael Altfeld of Michigan State University and political scientist Stephen Cimbala of Pennsylvania State University argued that the then already developed and deployed smaller, more accurate warheads (e.g. W76), together with lower detonation heights, could produce the same counterforce strike with a total of only 3 Mt of energy being expended. They continue that, \"if\" the nuclear winter models prove to be representative of reality, then far less climatic-cooling would occur, even if firestorm prone areas existed in the target list, as lower fusing heights such as surface bursts, would also limit the range of the burning thermal rays due to terrain masking and shadows cast by buildings, while also temporarily lofting far more localized fallout when compared to airburst fuzing – the standard mode of employment against un-hardened targets. This logic is similarly reflected in the originally classified 1984 \"Interagency Intelligence assessment\", which suggests that targeting planners would simply have to consider target combustibility along with yield, height of burst, timing and other factors to reduce the amount of smoke to safeguard against the potentiality of a nuclear winter. Therefore, as a consequence of attempting to limit the target fire hazard by reducing the range of thermal radiation with fuzing for surface and sub-surface bursts, this will result in a scenario where the far more concentrated, and therefore deadlier, \"local\" fallout that is generated following a surface burst forms, as opposed to the comparatively dilute \"global\" fallout created when nuclear weapons are fuzed in air burst mode.\n\nAltfeld and Cimbala also argued that belief in the possibility of nuclear winter would actually make nuclear war more likely, contrary to the views of Sagan and others, because it would serve yet further motivation to follow the \"existing trends\", towards the development of more accurate, and even lower explosive yield, nuclear weapons. As the winter hypothesis suggests that the replacement of the then Cold War viewed strategic nuclear weapons in the multi-megaton yield range, with weapons of explosive yields closer to tactical nuclear weapons, such as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), would safeguard against the nuclear winter potential. With the latter capabilities of the then, largely still conceptual RNEP, specifically cited by the influential nuclear warfare analyst Albert Wohlstetter. Tactical nuclear weapons, on the low end of the scale have yields that overlap with large conventional weapons, and are therefore often viewed \"as blurring the distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons\", making the prospect of using them \"easier\" in a conflict.\n\nIn an interview in 2000 with Mikhail Gorbachev (the leader of the Soviet Union from 1985–91), the following statement was posed to him: \"In the 1980s, you warned about the unprecedented dangers of nuclear weapons and took very daring steps to reverse the arms race\", with Gorbachev replying \"Models made by Russian and American scientists showed that a nuclear war would result in a nuclear winter that would be extremely destructive to all life on Earth; the knowledge of that was a great stimulus to us, to people of honor and morality, to act in that situation.\"\n\nHowever, a 1984 US Interagency Intelligence Assessment expresses a far more skeptical and cautious approach, stating that the hypothesis is not scientifically convincing. The report predicted that Soviet nuclear policy would be to maintain their strategic nuclear posture, such as their fielding of the high throw-weight SS-18 missile and they would merely attempt to exploit the hypothesis for propaganda purposes, such as directing scrutiny on the US portion of the nuclear arms race. Moreover, it goes on to express the belief that if Soviet officials did begin to take nuclear winter seriously, it would probably make them demand exceptionally high standards of scientific proof for the hypothesis, as the implications of it would undermine their military doctrine – a level of scientific proof which perhaps could not be met without field experimentation. The un-redacted portion of the document ends with the suggestion that substantial increases in Soviet Civil defense food stockpiles might be an early indicator that Nuclear Winter was beginning to influence Soviet upper echelon thinking.\n\nIn 1985 \"Time\" magazine noted \"the suspicions of some Western scientists that the nuclear winter hypothesis was promoted by Moscow to give anti-nuclear groups in the U.S. and Europe some fresh ammunition against America's arms buildup.\"\nIn 1985, the United States Senate met to discuss the science and politics of nuclear winter. During the congressional hearing, the influential analyst Leon Gouré presented evidence that perhaps the Soviets have simply echoed Western reports rather than producing unique findings. Gouré hypothesized that Soviet research and discussions of nuclear war may serve only Soviet political agendas, rather than to reflect actual opinions of Soviet leadership.\n\nIn 1986, the Defense Nuclear Agency document \"An update of Soviet research on and exploitation of Nuclear winter 1984–1986\" charted the minimal [public domain] research contribution on, and Soviet propaganda usage of, the nuclear winter phenomenon.\n\nThere is some doubt as to when the Soviet Union began modelling fires and the atmospheric effects of nuclear war. Former Soviet intelligence officer Sergei Tretyakov claimed that, under the directions of Yuri Andropov, the KGB invented the concept of \"nuclear winter\" in order to stop the deployment of NATO Pershing II missiles. They are said to have distributed to peace groups, the environmental movement and the journal \"Ambio\" disinformation based on a faked \"doomsday report\" by the Soviet Academy of Sciences by Georgii Golitsyn, Nikita Moiseyev and Vladimir Alexandrov concerning the climatic effects of nuclear war. Although it is accepted that the Soviet Union exploited the nuclear winter hypothesis for propaganda purposes, Tretyakov's inherent claim that the KGB funnelled disinformation to \"AMBIO\", the journal in which Paul Crutzen and John Birks published the 1982 paper \"Twilight at Noon\", has not been corroborated . In an interview in 2009, conducted by the National Security Archive, Vitalii Nikolaevich Tsygichko; a Senior Analyst at the Soviet Academy of Sciences and military mathematical modeler, stated that Soviet military analysts were discussing the idea of \"nuclear winter\" years before U.S. scientists, although they did not use that exact term.\n\nA number of solutions have been proposed to mitigate the potential harm of a nuclear winter if one appears inevitable; with the problem being attacked at both ends, from those focusing on preventing the growth of fires and therefore limiting the amount of smoke that reaches the stratosphere in the first place, and those focusing on food production with reduced sunlight, with the assumption that the very worst-case analysis results of the nuclear winter models prove accurate and no other mitigation strategies are fielded.\n\nIn a report from 1967, techniques included various methods of applying liquid nitrogen, dry ice, and water to nuclear-caused fires. The report considered attempting to stop the spread of fires by creating firebreaks by blasting combustible material out of an area, possibly even using nuclear weapons, along with the use of preventative Hazard Reduction Burns. According to the report, one of the most promising techniques investigated was initiation of rain from seeding of mass-fire thunderheads and other clouds passing over the developing, and then stable, firestorm.\n\nIn Feeding Everyone No Matter What, under the worst case scenario predictions of nuclear winter, the author's present various unconventional food possibilities including; natural-gas-digesting bacteria the most well known being Methylococcus capsulatus, that is presently used as a feed in Fish farming, Bark bread a long-standing famine food utilizing the edible inner bark of trees and part of Scandinavian history during the Little Ice Age, mention is similarly given to increased fungiculture or mushrooms such as the honey fungi that grow directly on moist wood without sunlight, and variations of wood or cellulosic biofuel production, which typically already creates edible sugars/xylitol from inedible cellulose, as an intermediate product before the final step of alcohol generation.\n\nThe minimum annual global wheat storage is approximately 2 months. To feed everyone despite nuclear winter, years of food storage prior to the event has been proposed. While the suggested masses of preserved food would likely never get used as a nuclear winter is comparatively unlikely to occur, the stockpiling of food would have the positive result of ameliorating the effect of the far more frequent disruptions to regional food supplies caused by lower-level conflicts and droughts. There is however the danger that if a sudden rush to food stockpiling occurs without the buffering effect offered by Victory gardens etc., it may exacerbate current food security problems by elevating present food prices.\n\nDespite the name \"nuclear winter\", nuclear events are not necessary to produce the modeled climatic effect. In an effort to find a quick and cheap solution to the global warming projection of at least 2 ˚C of surface warming as a result of the doubling in CO levels within the atmosphere, through solar radiation management (a form of climate engineering) the underlying nuclear winter effect has been looked at as perhaps holding potential. Besides the more common suggestion to inject sulfur compounds into the stratosphere to approximate the effects of a volcanic winter, the injection of other chemical species such as the release of a particular type of soot particle to create minor \"nuclear winter\" conditions, has been proposed by Paul Crutzen and others. According to the threshold \"nuclear winter\" computer models, if one to five teragrams of firestorm-generated soot is injected into the low stratosphere, it is modeled, through the anti-greenhouse effect, to heat the stratosphere but cool the lower troposphere and produce 1.25 °C cooling for two to three years; and after 10 years, average global temperatures would still be 0.5 °C lower than before the soot injection.\n\nSimilar climatic effects to \"nuclear winter\" followed historical supervolcano eruptions, which plumed sulfate aerosols high into the stratosphere, with this being known as a volcanic winter.\n\nSimilarly, extinction-level comet and asteroid impacts are also believed to have generated impact winters by the pulverization of massive amounts of fine rock dust. This pulverized rock can also produce \"volcanic winter\" effects, if sulfate-bearing rock is hit in the impact and lofted high into the air, and \"nuclear winter\" effects, with the heat of the heavier rock ejecta igniting regional and possibly even global forest firestorms.\n\nThis global \"impact firestorms\" hypothesis, initially supported by Wolbach, H. Jay Melosh and Owen Toon, suggests that as a result of massive impact events, the small sand-grain-sized ejecta fragments created can meteorically re-enter the atmosphere forming a hot blanket of global debris high in the air, potentially turning the entire sky red-hot for minutes to hours, and with that, burning the complete global inventory of above-ground carbonaceous material, including rain forests. This hypothesis is suggested as a means to explain the severity of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, as the earth impact of an asteroid about 10 km wide which precipitated the extinction is not regarded as sufficiently energetic to have caused the level of extinction from the initial impact's energy release alone.\n\nThe global firestorm winter, however, has been questioned in more recent years (2003–2013) by Claire Belcher, Tamara Goldin and Melosh, who had initially supported the hypothesis, with this re-evaluation being dubbed the \"Cretaceous-Palaeogene firestorm debate\" by Belcher. The issues raised by these scientists in the debate are the perceived low quantity of soot in the sediment beside the fine-grained iridium-rich asteroid dust layer, if the quantity of re-entering ejecta was perfectly global in blanketing the atmosphere, and if so, the duration and profile of the re-entry heating, whether it was a high thermal pulse of heat or the more prolonged and therefore more incendiary \"oven\" heating, and finally, how much the \"self-shielding effect\" from the first wave of now-cooled meteors in dark flight contributed to diminishing the total heat experienced on the ground from later waves of meteors.\n\nIn part due to the Cretaceous period being a high-atmospheric-oxygen era, with concentrations above that of the present day. Owen Toon et al. in 2013 were critical of the re-evaluations the hypothesis is undergoing.\n\nIt is difficult to successfully ascertain the percentage contribution of the soot in this period's geological sediment record from living plants and fossil fuels present at the time, in much the same manner that the fraction of the material ignited directly by the meteor impact is difficult to determine.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "295123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295123", "title": "Rijeka", "text": "Rijeka\n\nRijeka (; , ; ; ) is the principal seaport and the third-largest city in Croatia (after Zagreb and Split). It is located in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County on Kvarner Bay, an inlet of the Adriatic Sea and has a population of 128,624 inhabitants. \nHistorically, because of its strategic position and its excellent deep-water port, the city was fiercely contested, especially among Italy, Hungary (serving as the Kingdom of Hungary's largest and most important port), and Croatia, changing hands and demographics many times over centuries. According to the 2011 census data, the overwhelming majority of its citizens (94.52%) are Croats, along with small numbers of Bosniaks, Italians and Serbs. The city has a strong local sense of identity and the autochthonous inhabitants of Rijeka are referred to as Fiumans.\n\nRijeka is the main city of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County. The city's economy largely depends on shipbuilding (shipyards \"3. Maj\" and \"Viktor Lenac Shipyard\") and maritime transport. Rijeka hosts the Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc, first built in 1765, as well as the University of Rijeka, founded in 1973 but with roots dating back to 1632 School of Theology.\n\nApart from Croatian and Italian, linguistically the city is home to its own unique dialect of the Venetian language, \"Fiuman\", with an estimated 20,000 speakers among the autochthonous Italians, Croats and other minorities. Historically Fiuman served as the main lingua franca between the many ethnicities inhabiting the multiethnic port-town. In certain suburbs of the modern extended municipality the autochthonous population still speaks the Chakavian tongue, a dialect of the Croatian language.\n\nIn 2016, Rijeka was selected as the European Capital of Culture for 2020, alongside Galway, Republic of Ireland.\n\nHistorically, Rijeka was also called Tharsatica, Vitopolis (), or Flumen () in Latin. The city is called \"Rijeka\" in Croatian, \"Reka\" in Slovene, and \"Reka\" or \"Rika\" in the local dialects of the Chakavian language. It is called \"Fiume\" () in Italian. All these names mean \"river\" in their respective languages. Meanwhile, Hungarian has adopted the Italian name while in German the city has been called \"Sankt Veit am Flaum\"—St Vito on the river Flaum—or \"Pflaum\" ().\n\nRijeka is located in western Croatia, southwest of the capital, Zagreb, on the northern coast of Rijeka Bay (), as part of a larger Kvarner Gulf of the Adriatic Sea, which is a large bay Mediterranean Sea most deeply indented to the European mainland. The Bay of Rijeka, which is bordered by Vela Vrata (between Istria and the island of Cres), Srednja Vrata (between Cres and Krk Island) and Mala Vrata (between Krk and the mainland) is connected to the Bay of Kvarner and is deep enough (about ) for the biggest sailing ships. The City of Rijeka lies at the mouth of river Rječina and in the Vinodol micro-region of the Croatian coast. Two important land transport routes start in Rijeka due to its location. The first route is to the Pannonian Basin given that Rijeka is located alongside the narrowest point of the Dinaric Alps (about ). The other route, across Postojna Gate connects Rijeka with Slovenia, Italy and beyond.\n\nThough traces of Neolithic settlements can be found in the region, the earliest modern settlements on the site were Celtic Tharsatica (modern Trsat, now part of Rijeka) on the hill, and the tribe of mariners, the Liburni, in the natural harbour below. The city long retained its dual character. Pliny mentioned Tarsatica in his \"Natural History\" (iii.140).\n\nIn the time of Augustus, the Romans rebuilt Tharsatica as a \"municipium\" Flumen (MacMullen 2000), situated on the right bank of small river Rječina (whose name means \"the big river\"). It became a city within the Roman Province of Dalmatia until the 6th century.\nAfter the 4th century Rijeka was rededicated to St. Vitus, the city's patron saint, as \"Terra Fluminis sancti Sancti Viti\" or in German \"Sankt Veit am Pflaum\". From the 5th century onwards, the town was ruled successively by the Ostrogoths, the Byzantines, the Lombards, and the Avars. Croats settled the city starting in the 7th century giving it the Croatian name, \"Rika svetoga Vida\" (\"the river of St. Vitus\"). At the time, Rijeka was a feudal stronghold surrounded by a wall. At the center of the city, its highest point, was a fortress.\n\nIn 799 Rijeka was attacked by the Frankish troops of Charlemagne. Their Siege of Trsat was at first repulsed, during which the Frankish commander Duke Eric of Friuli was killed. However, the Frankish forces finally occupied and devastated the castle, while the Duchy of Croatia passed under the overlordship of the Carolingian Empire. From about 925, the town was part of the Kingdom of Croatia, from 1102 in personal union with Hungary. Trsat Castle and the town was rebuilt under the rule of the House of Frankopan. In 1288 the Rijeka citizens signed the Law codex of Vinodol, one of the oldest codes of law in Europe.\n\nRijeka even rivalled with Venice when it was purchased by the Habsburg emperor Frederick III, Archduke of Austria in 1466. It would remain under Habsburg overlordship for over 450 years, except for French rule between 1805 and 1813, until its occupation by Croatian and subsequently Italian irregulars at the end of World War I.\n\nAfter coming under Habsburg rule in 1466, the town was attacked and plundered by Venetian forces in 1509. While Ottoman forces attacked the town several times, they never occupied it. From the 16th century onwards, Rijeka was largely rebuilt in its present Renaissance and Baroque style. Emperor Charles VI declared the Port of Rijeka a free port (together with the Port of Trieste) in 1719 and had the trade route to Vienna expanded in 1725.\n\nBy order of Empress Maria Theresa in 1779, the city was annexed to the Kingdom of Hungary and governed as \"corpus separatum\" directly from Budapest by an appointed governor, as Hungary's only international port. From 1804, Rijeka was part of the Austrian Empire (Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia after the Compromise of 1867), in the Croatia-Slavonia province.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the prominent economical and cultural leader of the city was Andrija Ljudevit Adamić. Fiume also had a significant naval base, and in the mid-19th century it became the site of the Austro-Hungarian Naval Academy (K.u.K. Marine-Akademie), where the Austro-Hungarian Navy trained its officers.\n\nGiovanni de Ciotta (mayor from 1872 to 1896) proved to be an authoritative local political leader. Under his leadership, an impressive phase of expansion of the city started, marked by major port development, fuelled by the general expansion of international trade and the city's connection (1873) to the Austro-Hungarian railway network. Modern industrial and commercial enterprises such as the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company \"Adria\", and the paper mill, situated in the Rječina canyon, producing cigarette paper sold around the world, became trademarks of the city.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century (up to World War I) was a period of rapid economic growth and technological dynamism for Rijeka. The industrial development of the city included the first industrial scale oil refinery in Europe in 1882 and the first torpedo factory in the world in 1866, after Robert Whitehead, manager of the \"Stabilimento Tecnico Fiumano\" (an Austrian engineering company engaged in providing engines for the Austro-Hungarian Navy), designed and successfully tested the world's first torpedo.\n\nRijeka also became a pioneering centre for high-speed photography. The Austrian physicist Peter Salcher working in Rijeka's Austro-Hungarian Marine Academy took the first photograph of a bullet flying at supersonic speed in 1886, devising a technique that was later used by Ernst Mach in his studies of supersonic motion.\n\nRijeka's port underwent tremendous development fuelled by generous Hungarian investments, becoming the main maritime outlet for Hungary and the eastern part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the fifth port in the Mediterranean, after Marseilles, Genoa, Naples and Trieste. The population grew rapidly from only 21,000 in 1880 to 50,000 in 1910. Major civic buildings constructed at this time include the Governor's Palace, designed by the Hungarian architect Alajos Hauszmann. There was an ongoing competition between Rijeka and Trieste, the main maritime outlet for Austria – reflecting the rivalry between the two components of the Dual Monarchy. The Austro-Hungarian Navy sought to keep the balance by ordering new warships from the shipyards of both cities.\n\nApart from the rapid economic growth, the period encompassing the second half of the 19th century and up to World War I also saw a shift in the ethnic composition of the city. The Kingdom of Hungary, which administered the city during that period, favoured the Hungarian element in the city and encouraged immigration from all lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In this period the city became a melting pot encompassing most of the main ethnicities and cultures in empire, being also a main departure port for emigration to the New World. The mixed ethnic composition would open the doors to the controversial \"Fiume's Question\" in the years following World War I and the demise of the Habsburg Empire.\nAt the last Austro-Hungarian census in 1911, the \"corpus separatum\" had a population of 49,608 people and was composed of the following linguistic communities:\n\nHabsburg-ruled Austria-Hungary's disintegration in October 1918 during the closing weeks of World War I led to the establishment of rival Croatian-Serbian and Italian administrations in the city; both Italy and the founders of the new Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) claimed sovereignty based on their \"irredentist\" (\"unredeemed\") ethnic populations.\n\nAfter a brief military occupation by the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes, followed by the unilateral annexation of the former Corpus Separatum by Belgrade, an international force of British, Italian, French and American troops entered the city in November 1918. Its future came under discussion at the Paris Peace Conference during the course of 1919.\nItaly based its claim on the fact that Italians comprised the largest single nationality within the city (46.9% of the total population). Croats made up most of the remainder and were a majority in the surrounding area Andrea Ossoinack, who had been the last delegate from Fiume to the Hungarian Parliament, was admitted to the conference as a representative of Fiume, and essentially supported the Italian claims. Nevertheless, the city had a strong and very active Autonomist Party, which also had its delegates at the Paris conference and was represented by Ruggero Gotthardi.\n\nOn 10 September 1919, the Treaty of Saint-Germain was signed, declaring the Austro-Hungarian monarchy dissolved. Negotiations over the future of the city were interrupted two days later when a force of Italian nationalist irregulars led by the poet Gabriele d'Annunzio seized control of the city without casualties and acclaimed by a part of the population. Because the Italian government, wishing to respect the international agreement, did not want to annex Fiume, d'Annunzio and the intellectuals at his side eventually established a state, the Italian Regency of Carnaro, a unique social experiment for the age and a revolutionary cultural experience in which various international intellectuals of diverse walks of life took part (like Osbert Sitwell, Arturo Toscanini, Henry Furst, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Harukichi Shimoi, Guglielmo Marconi, Alceste De Ambris, Léon Kochnitzky, Whitney Warren).\n\nAmong the many political experiments that took place during this period, d'Annunzio and his men undertook a first attempt to establish a movement of non-aligned nations in the so-called League of Fiume, an organisation antithetic to the Wilsonian League of Nations, which it saw as a means of perpetuating a corrupt and imperialist \"status quo\". The organisation was aiming primarily at helping all oppressed nationalities in their struggle for political dignity and recognition, establishing links with many movements on various continents, but it never found the necessary external support and its main legacy remains today the Regency of Carnaro's recognition of Soviet Russia, the first state in the world to have done so.\nThe Liberal Giovanni Giolitti became Premier of Italy again in June 1920; this signalled a hardening of official attitudes to d'Annunzio's \"coup\". On 12 November, Italy and Yugoslavia concluded the Treaty of Rapallo, which envisaged Fiume becoming an independent state, the Free State of Fiume, under a government acceptable to both powers. d'Annunzio's response was characteristically flamboyant and of doubtful judgment: his declaration of war against Italy invited the bombardment by Italian royal forces which led to his surrender of the city at the end of the year, after five days' resistance (known as Bloody Christmas). Italian troops freed the city from d'Annunzio's militias in December 1920.\n\nIn a subsequent democratic election the Fiuman electorate on April 24, 1921 approved the idea of a free state of Fiume-Rijeka with an Italo-Fiuman-Yugoslav consortium for the port, giving an overwhelming victory to the independentist Autonomist Party. Fiume became a full-fledged member of the League of Nations and the ensuing election of Rijeka's first president, Riccardo Zanella, was met with official recognition and greetings from all major powers.\nThe subsequent formation of a constituent assembly for the new country did not put an end to strife within the city. A brief Italian nationalist seizure of power ended with the intervention of an Italian royal commissioner, and another short-lived peace was interrupted by a local Fascist putsch in March 1922 which ended with a third Italian intervention to ripristinate the previous order. Seven months later the Kingdom of Italy itself fell under Fascist rule and Fiume's fate was therefore set, the Italian Fascist Party being among the strongest proponents of the annexation of Fiume to Italy. The Free State of Fiume thus was to officially become the first country victim of fascist expansionism.\n\nThis period of diplomatic acrimony closed with the bilateral Treaty of Rome (27 January 1924), signed by Italy and Yugoslavia. With it the two neighbouring countries were agreeing on invading and partitioning the territory of the small state. Most of the territory of the old Corpus Separatum became part of Italy, while a few northern villages of Croatian-Slovenian language were annexed by Yugoslavia. The annexation happened de facto on the 16th of March 1924, and it inaugurated circa twenty years of Italian government for the city proper.\n\nWith the Treaty of Rome (27 January 1924) between the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the two countries agreed to annex and split the territory of the Free State of Fiume between themselves. The formal annexation (16 March 1924) inaugurated 19 years of Italian fascist rule and the city became the seat of the newly formed Province of Carnaro.\nIn this period Fiume lost its commercial hinterland and thus part of its economic potential, due to it becoming a border town with little strategic importance for the Kingdom of Italy. But thanks to it retaining the Free Port status, and its iconic image in the fascist nation-building myth it gained many specific concessions from the government in Rome, a separate tax treatment from the rest of the Kingdom and a more humble than in Hungarian times, but continuous inflow of investments from the state. This could still not avoid a substantial slowing of the economic and demographic growth compared to the previous Austro-Hungarian period.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II Rijeka immediately found itself in an awkward position. The city was overwhelmingly Italian, but its immediate surroundings and the city of Sušak, just across the Rječina river (today a part of Rijeka proper) were inhabited almost exclusively by Croatians and part of a potentially hostile power – Yugoslavia. Once the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Croatian areas surrounding the city were occupied by the Italian military, setting the stage for an intense and bloody insurgency which would last until the end of the war.\nPartisan activity included guerrilla-style attacks on isolated positions or supply columns, sabotage and killings of civilians believed to be connected to the Italian and (later) German authorities. This, in turn, was met by stiff reprisals from the Italian and German military. On 14 July 1942, in reprisal for the killing of 4 civilians of Italian origin by the Partisans, the Italian military killed 100 men from the suburban village of Podhum, resettling the remaining 800 people to concentration camps.\n\nAfter the surrender of Italy to the Allies in September 1943, Rijeka and the surrounding territories were occupied by Germany, becoming part of the Adriatic Littoral Zone. The partisan activity continued and intensified. On 30 April 1944, in the nearby village of Lipa, German troops killed 263 civilians in reprisal for the killing of several soldiers during a partisan attack.\nBecause of its industries (oil refinery, torpedo factory, shipyards) and its port facilities, the city was also a target of frequent (more than 30) Anglo-American air attacks, which caused widespread destruction and hundreds of civilian deaths. Some of the worst bombardments happened on 12 January 1944 (attack on the refinery, part of the Oil Campaign), on 3–6 November 1944, when a series of attacks resulted in at least 125 deaths and between 15 and 25 February 1945 (200 dead, 300 wounded).\n\nThe area of Rijeka was heavily fortified even before World War II (the remains of these fortifications can be seen today on the city outskirts). This was the fortified border between Italy and Yugoslavia which, at that time, cut across the city area and its surroundings. As Yugoslav troops approached the city in April 1945, one of the fiercest and largest battles in this area of Europe ensued. The 27,000 German and additional Italian troops fought tenaciously from behind these fortifications (renamed \"Ingridstellung\" – Ingrid Line – by the Germans). Under the command of the German general Ludwig Kübler they inflicted thousands of casualties on the attacking Yugoslav partisans, which were forced to charge uphill against well-fortified positions to the north and east of the city. Ultimately the Germans were forced to retreat. Before leaving the city, in an act of wanton destruction (World War II was almost over), the German troops destroyed the harbour area and other infrastructure with a number of big explosive charges. However, the German attempt to break out of the partisan encirclement north-west of the city was unsuccessful. Of the approximately 27,000 German and other troops retreating from the city, 11,000 were killed (many were executed after surrendering), while the remaining 16,000 were taken prisoner. Yugoslav troops entered Rijeka on 3 May 1945. The city had suffered extensive damage in the war. The economic infrastructure was almost completely destroyed, and of the 5400 buildings in the city at the time, 2890 (53%) were either completely destroyed or heavily damaged.\n\nThe city's fate was again resolved by a combination of force and diplomacy. Despite the requests of the Fiuman government in exile and the initial promises of large autonomy for the city by the Yugoslav authorities (up to it becoming a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), the city became part of Yugoslavia (within the federal state of Croatia). The situation was formalised by the Paris peace treaty between Italy and the wartime Allies on 10 February 1947, despite the protests of the last democratically elected government and its president in exile Riccardo Zanella, and the attempts by experienced Italian foreign minister Carlo Sforza to uphold the previous Wilsonian plans for a Free State solution, with a local headquarter for the newly created United Nations. Once the change to Yugoslav sovereignty was formalised, and in particular in the years leading to the Trieste Crisis of 1954, 58,000 of the 66,000 Italian speakers were gradually pushed to either emigrate (they became known in Italian as \"esuli\" or the \"exiled ones\" from Istria, Fiume and Dalmatia) or endure a harsh oppression by the new Yugoslav communist regime during the first decades of its existence. The Yugoslav communist party opted for Stalinist approach in solving the local ethnic question in particular after the Autonomist-sympathisers gained massive support in the first local elections held on the city's territory after the war.\n\nThe discrimination and persecution many inhabitants experienced at the hands of the Yugoslav officials in the last days of World War II and the first years of peace still remain painful memories for the \"esuli\" and somewhat of a taboo topic for Rijeka's political milieu, which is still largely denying the events.\nSummary executions of alleged fascists (often well-known anti-fascists or openly apolitical), aimed at hitting the local intellectual class, the Autonomists, Italian public servants, military officials and even ordinary civilians (at least 650 executions of Italians took place after the end of the war) forced most ethnic Italians to leave Rijeka/Fiume in order to avoid becoming a victim of harsher retaliation. The removal was a meticulously-planned operation, aimed at convincing the hardly assimilable Italian part of the autochthonous population to leave the country, as testified decades later by representatives' of the Yugoslav leadership.\nThe most notable victims of the political and ethnic repression of locals in this period has been the Fiume Autonomists purge hitting the autonomists still living in the city, and now associated in the Liburnian Autonomist Movement. These actively helped the Yugoslav partisans in liberating the region from Fascist and Nazi occupation, and despite previous promises of large autonomy for Fiume inside the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, were killed by the Yugoslav secret police OZNA in the days leading and following the Yugoslav army entry the city.\nIn the subsequent years the Yugoslav authorities joined the municipalities of Fiume and Sušak and after 1954 less than one third of the original population of the now united municipalities (mostly the ethnic Croats) remained in the city. The old municipality of Fiume lost in these years more than 85% of the original population. Subsequently, the city was resettled by many immigrants from various parts of Yugoslavia, changing heavily the city's demographics and its linguistic composition. This years coincided also with a period of reconstruction and new industrialisation. During the period of the Yugoslav communist administration in the 1950s–1980s the city became the main port of the Federal Republic and started to grow once again both demographically and economically thanks to the fact it got once again a solid hinterland, as well as the refurbishing of its traditional manufacturing industries after the war, its maritime economy and its port, now the largest in the country. It soon became the second richest (GDP per capita) district of Yugoslavia. Many of these industries were a product of a socialist planned economy and the unique Yugoslav cooperative model, and they have not been able to adapt when the economy transitioned to a fully market-oriented model in the early 1990s, not last due to many cases of embezzlement and corruption during the hastened privatisation process in the newly formed Republic of Croatia.\n\nThus in 1991 Yugoslavia broke apart, and the federal state of Croatia became independent during the Croatian War of Independence. Since then, the city has stagnated economically and its demography has plunged. Some of its largest industries and employers went out of business (among the most prominent the Jugolinija shipping company, the torpedo factory, the paper mill and many other medium or small manufacturing and commercial companies, often in the midst of big corruption scandals and a badly planned privatization). Others are struggling to stay economically viable (like the city's landmark 3. Maj shipyards). The city passed from more than 80,000 workers in production to only 5,000 within two decades. A difficult and uncertain transition of the city's economy away from manufacturing and towards the service industry and tourism is still in progress. In 2020 Rijeka will be the European Capital of Culture alongside Galway, in 2018 it was announced that, 65 years after the abolishment of Italian as an official language of Rijeka, new Croatian-Italian bilingual road signs will be placed for the occasion. \n\nThe Rijeka Carnival Croatian: \"Riječki karneval\") is held each year before Lent (between late January and early March) in Rijeka, Croatia. Established in 1982, it has become the biggest carnival in Croatia. Every year there are numerous events preceding the carnival itself. First the mayor of Rijeka gives the symbolic key of the city to Meštar Toni, who is \"the maestro\" of the carnival, and he becomes the mayor of the city during the carnival, although this is only figuratively. Same day, there is an election of the carnival queen. As all the cities around Rijeka have their own events during the carnival time, Queen and Meštar Toni are attending most of them.\n\nAlso, every year the Carnival charity ball is held in the Governor's palace in Rijeka. It is attended by politicians, people from sport and media life, as well as a number of ambassadors.\n\nThe weekend before the main event there are two other events held. One is Rally Paris – Bakar. (after the Dakar rally). The start is a part of Rijeka called Paris after the restaurant located there, and the end is in city of Bakar, located about south east. All of the participants of the rally wear masks, and the cars are mostly modified old cars. The other event is the children's carnival, held, like the main one, on Rijeka`s main walkway Korzo. The groups that participate are mostly from kindergartens and elementary schools, including groups from other parts of Croatia and neighboring countries. In 1982 there were only three masked groups on Rijeka`s main walkway Korzo. In recent years, the international carnival has attracted around 15,000 participants from all over the world organized in over 200 carnival groups, with crowds of over 100,000.\n\nIn the census of 2011, city proper had a population of 128,624, which include:\n\nOther groups, including Slovenians and Hungarians, formed less than 1% each.\n\nThe following tables list the city's population, along with the population of ex-municipality (disbanded in 1995), the urban and the metropolitan area.\n\n\nPanoramic view of Rijeka from Opatija:\n\nPanoramic view of Rijeka and Učka:\nScientists, professors and inventors\n\nArts and culture\n\nPolitics and institutions\n\nEconomists and Entreprenurs\n\nFamous sportsmen\n\nMusicians\n\n\nThe terrain configuration, with mountains rising steeply just a few kilometres inland from the shores of the Adriatic, provides for some striking climatic and landscape contrasts within a small geographic area. Beaches can be enjoyed throughout summer in a typically Mediterranean setting along the coastal areas of the city to the east (Pećine, Kostrena) and west (Kantrida, Preluk). At the same time, the ski resort of Platak, located only about from the city, offers alpine skiing and abundant snow during winter months (at times until early May). The Kvarner Bay and its islands are visible from the ski slopes.\nRijeka has a Humid subtropical climate with warm summers and relatively mild and rainy winters. Snow is rare (usually three days per year, almost always occurring in patches). There are 20 days a year with a maximum of or higher, while on one day a year the temperature does not exceed . Fog appears in about four days per year, mainly in winter. The climate is also characterized by frequent rainfall. Cold (bora) winds are common in wintertime.\n\nThe Port of Rijeka is the largest port in Croatia, with a cargo throughput in 2017 of 12.6 million tonnes, mostly crude oil and refined petroleum products, general cargo and bulk cargo, and 260,337 Twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). The port is managed by the Port of Rijeka Authority. The first record of a port in Rijeka date back to 1281, and in 1719, the Port of Rijeka was granted a charter as a free port. There are ferry connections between Rijeka and the surrounding islands and cities, but no direct international passenger ship connections. There are coastal lines to Split and onward to Dubrovnik, which operate twice weekly and have international connections.\n\nThe city is difficult to get to by air outside of the tourist season. The city's own international airport, Rijeka Airport is located on the nearby island of Krk across the tolled Krk Bridge. Buses, with a journey time of approximately 45 minutes, operate from Rijeka city center and nearby Opatija, with a schedule based on the planned arrival and departure times of flights. Handling 142,111 passengers in 2017, the facility is more of a charter airport than a serious transport hub, although various scheduled airlines have begun to service it with a comparatively large number of flights coming from airports in Germany. Most of these flights only operate during the toursit season between approximately May and October. Alternative nearby airports include Pula (90 minutes drive from Rijeka) and Zagreb (around 2.5 hours).\n\nRijeka has efficient road connections to other parts of Croatia and neighbouring countries. The A6 motorway connects Rijeka to Zagreb via the A1, while the A7 motorway, completed in 2004, links Rijeka with Ljubljana, Slovenia, via Ilirska Bistrica and with Trieste, Italy. The A7 acts as the Rijeka bypass motorway and facilitates access to the A8 motorway of the Istrian Y network starting with the Učka Tunnel, and linking Rijeka with Istria. As of August 2011, the bypass is being extended eastwards to the Krk Bridge area and new feeder roads are under construction.\n\nRijeka is integrated into the Croatian railway network and international rail lines. A fully electrified railway connects Rijeka to Zagreb and beyond towards Koprivnica and the Hungarian border as part of Pan-European corridor Vb. Rijeka is also connected to Trieste and Ljubljana by a separate electrified line that extends northwards from the city. Rijeka has direct connections by daily trains to Vienna, Munich, and Salzburg, and night trains running through Rijeka. Construction of a new high performance railway between Rijeka and Zagreb, extending to Budapest is planned, as well as rail links connecting Rijeka to the island of Krk and between Rijeka and Pula.\n\nThe history of Rijeka's organised sports started between 1885 and 1888 with the foundation of the Club Alpino Fiumano in 1885, the Young American Cycle Club in 1887 (the first club of this American league to be founded in a foreign land), and the Nautico Sport Club Quarnero in 1888 by the Hungarian minority of the city. Even earlier, in 1873, following the initiative by Robert Whitehead, the first football match to be disputed in today's Republic of Croatia territory was played in Rijeka: the Hungarian Railways team and the English engineers-led team of the Stabilimento Tecnico di Fiume (later Torpedo Factory of Fiume). The first football club in Fiume was founded under the name of Fiumei Atletikai Club.\n\nToday, HNK Rijeka are the city's main football team. They compete in the Croatian First Football League and were the champions of Croatia in 2016–17. Until July 2015, HNK Rijeka were based at the iconic Stadion Kantrida. With Kantrida awaiting reconstruction, they are based at the newly-built Stadion Rujevica, their temporary home ground located in the club's new training camp. Additionally, HNK Orijent 1919 are based in Sušak and play in the Croatian Third Football League.\n\nRijeka's other notable sports clubs include RK Zamet and ŽRK Zamet (handball), VK Primorje EB (waterpolo), KK Kvarner (basketball) and ŽOK Rijeka (women's volleyball).\n\nRijeka hosted the 2008 European Short Course Swimming Championships. In its more than 80 years of history, LEN had never seen so many records set as the number of them set at \"Bazeni Kantrida\" (Kantrida Swimming Complex). A total of 14 European Records were set of which 10 World Records and even 7 World Best Times. This championship also presented a record in the number of participating countries. There were more than 600 top athletes, from some 50 European countries. Swimmers from 21 nations won medals and 40 of the 51 national member Federations of LEN were present in Rijeka.\n\nRijeka is twinned with:\nA stylised version of Fiume during the 1920s was one of the main settings in the 1992 movie Porco Rosso by world acclaimed Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, as the town in front of which the fantastical \"Hotel Adriano\" is found and to which it is connected by a boat service taken by the protagonist. Bruce Sterling's November 2016 novel written in collaboration with Warren Ellis, \"Pirate Utopia\", a Dieselpunk alternative history, is set in Fiume (now Rijeka) in 1920 during the short-lived Italian Regency of Carnaro. The 1980s American TV series \"The Winds of War\" was in part filmed in Rijeka and the surrounding areas. The popular German western Winnetou movies from the 1960s, based on Karl May novels, were in part filmed on location in the outskirts of Rijeka. The setting of the popular 1970s cartoon series Professor Balthazar was inspired by Rijeka. The TV series \"\" (\"The Paper\"), which has been streaming on Netflix since April 2018, is based in Rijeka and the city was used as the main filming location.\n\n\n"}

The Serbian Revival began earlier than the Bulgarian National Revival. The first revolt in the Ottoman Empire to acquire a national character was the Serbian Revolution (1804–1817), which was the culmination of the Serbian renaissance. According to Jelena Milojković-Djurić: \"The first literary and learned society among the Slavs was Matica srpska, founded by the leaders of Serbian revival in Pest in 1826.\" Vojvodina became the cradle of the Serbian renaissance during the 19th century. Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787–1864) was the most instrumental in this period.\n\nThe Serbian Revival threatened to jeopardize Austria, to question its strategic interests. The Serbs had established the short-lived Serbian Vojvodina during the 1848 Revolutions through armed conflict with the Hungarians, as part of the Revival.\n\nAlthough the Serbian Revival adopted the idea of cooperation between the Yugoslav peoples, and was influenced by its national policy basis and possibility of establishment of a Yugoslav state, it still, in a cultural and national-political view, stayed Pan-Serb.\n\n"}

The field is concerned with the study of material remains to reconstruct and interpret past life-ways of alien civilizations. Xenoarchaeology is not currently practiced by mainstream archaeologists due to the current lack of any material for the discipline to study.\n\nThe name derives from Greek \"xenos\" (ξένος) which means 'stranger, alien', and archaeology 'study of ancients'.\n\nXenoarchaeology is sometimes called \"astroarchaeology\" or \"exoarchaeology\", although some would argue that the prefix exo- would be more correctly applied to the study of human activities in a space environment.\n\nOther names for xenoarchaeology, or specialised fields of interest, include Probe SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), extraterrestrial archaeology, space archaeology, SETA (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Artifacts), Dysonian SETI, Planetary SETI, SETT (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Technology), SETV (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Visitation), extraterrestrial anthropology, areoarchaeology and selenoarchaeology.\n\nIt is arguably the case that, due to the immense distances between stars, any evidence we discover of extraterrestrial intelligence, whether it be an artifact or an electromagnetic signal, may come from a long-vanished civilization. Thus the entire SETI project can be seen as a form of archaeology. Additionally, due to the extreme age of the universe, there may be a reasonable expectation for astrobiology research to produce evidence of extinct alien life prior to the discovery of alien life itself.\n\nThe study of alien cultures might offer us glimpses into our own species' past or future development.\n\nVicky Walsh argued for the existence of \"exo-artifacts\" using the principle of mediocrity and the Drake equation. She proposed that a theoretical and speculative field of archaeology be established in order to test outlandish claims, and to prepare for a time when undeniably extraterrestrial artifacts needed to be analysed. \"If it is possible to construct an abstract archaeology that can be tested and refined on earth and then applied to areas beyond our planet, then the claims for ETI remains on the moon and Mars may really be evaluated in light of established archaeological theory and analysis\".\n\nBen McGee similarly proposed the creation of a set of interdisciplinary, proactive xenoarchaeological guidelines, arguing that identifying suspected artifacts of astrobiology is all that is required to justify establishing a methodology for xenoarchaeology. He emphasized the necessity of proactive xenoarchaeological work in order to avoid future bias, mischaracterization, and information mismanagement, and he cites three scenarios under which such a methodology or set of guidelines would be useful, those being \"remote sensing\" of a potential xenoarchaeologial artifact, encountering an artifact during \"human exploration,\" and \"terrestrial interception\" of an artifact.\n\nGreg Fewer has argued that archaeological techniques should be used to evaluate alleged UFO landing or crash sites, such as Roswell.\n\nThe origins of the field have been traced to theories about a hypothetical Martian civilization based on observations of what were perceived as canals on Mars. These theories, of which Percival Lowell was the most famous exponent, were apparently inspired by a mistranslation of a quote by Giovanni Schiaparelli.\n\nThe 1997 Theoretical Archaeology Group conference featured a session on \"archaeology and science fiction\".\n\nThe 2004 annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association featured a session \"Anthropology, Archaeology and Interstellar Communication\".\n\nPlanetary SETI is concerned with the search for extraterrestrial structures on the surface of bodies in the Solar System. Claims for evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts can be divided into three groups, the Moon, Mars, and the other planets and their satellites.\n\nExamples of sites of interest include the \"bridge\" sighted in the Mare Crisium in 1953, and the \"Blair Cuspids\", \"an unusual arrangement of seven spirelike objects of varying heights\" at the western edge of the \"Mare Tranquillitatis\", photographed by in Lunar Orbiter 2 on November 20, 1966. In 2006, Ian Crawford proposed that a search for alien artifacts be conducted on the Moon.\n\nPercival Lowell's mistaken identification of Martian canals was an early attempt to detect and study an alien culture from its supposed physical remains. More recently, there was interest in the supposed Face on Mars.\n\nThe Society for Planetary SETI Research is a loose organization of researchers interested in this field. The organization does not endorse any particular conclusions drawn by its members on particular sites.\n\nA great deal of research and writing has been done, and some searches conducted for extraterrestrial probes in the Solar System. This followed the work of Ronald N. Bracewell.\n\nRobert Freitas, Christopher Rose and Gregory Wright have argued that interstellar probes can be a more energy-efficient means of communication than electromagnetic broadcasts.\n\nIf so, a solarcentric Search for Extraterrestrial Artifacts (SETA) would seem to be favored over the more traditional radio or optical searches.\nRobert A. Freitas coined the Term SETA in the 1980s.\n\nOn the basis that the Earth-Moon or Sun-Earth libration orbits might constitute convenient parking places for automated extraterrestrial probes, unsuccessful searches were conducted by Freitas and Valdes.\n\nIn a 1960 paper, Freeman Dyson proposed the idea of a Dyson sphere, a type of extraterrestrial artifact able to be searched for and studied at interstellar distances. Following that paper, several searches have been conducted.\n\nIn a 2005 paper, Luc Arnold proposed a means of detecting smaller, though still mega-scale, artifacts from their distinctive transit light curve signature. \"(see Astroengineering)\".\n\nA subculture of enthusiasts studies purported structures on the Moon or Mars. These controversial \"structures\" (such as the Face on Mars) are not accepted as more than natural features by most scientists, examples of the pareidolia phenomenon.\n\nPalaeocontact or ancient astronaut theories, espoused by Erich von Däniken and others, are further examples of fringe theories. These claim that the Earth was visited in prehistoric times by extraterrestrial beings.\n\nXenoarchaeological themes are common in science fiction. Works about the exploration of enigmatic extraterrestrial artifacts have been satirically categorized as Big Dumb Object stories.\n\nSome of the more prominent examples of xenoarchaeological fiction include Arthur C. Clarke's novel \"Rendezvous with Rama\", H. Beam Piper's short story \"Omnilingual\", and Charles Sheffield's Heritage Universe series.\n\nJack McDevitt's science fiction novels often revolve around human or alien historical and archaeological mysteries.\n\n\"Mass Effect\"'s plot revolves around technologies in the form of structures, transportation, buildings and machines left behind by an extinct alien race.\n\nThe primary setting of \"\" takes place on a massive structure created by an ancient, extinct alien super race. These structures feature prominently in the sequels \"Halo 2\", \"Halo 3\", and \"Halo 4\".\n\nIn the video game \"Borderlands\", and its sequel \"Borderlands 2\", the Atlas corporation started mining the planet Pandora after finding evidence of an ancient material called Eridium. This material was supposedly created by extraterrestrial creatures or is a natural product of long-term planetary production.\n\nIn the video game \"Stellaris\", players usually found extraterrestrial artifacts from a extinct civilization before actually encounter native space creatures or other extraterrestrial civilizations.Such discovery would also raise a \"Exist of extraterrestrial life has been proven\" news event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Nakonechny was married to a ceramic artist Valentyna Kukharska and had two children.\n\nIn his writings, Nakonechny was a staunch defender of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). In his memoir (Shoah in Lviv) about the Holocaust in Lviv he attempted to rebuff the claims by Polish, Jewish, German and American historians that OUN in particular, and Ukrainian nationalists in general, were complicit in the Holocaust. In some extreme cases he denied what he saw with his own eyes. – \"Nakonechny wrote positively of the Ukrainian militia in Lviv, organized by OUN and later dissolved by the Gestapo and replaced by the Ukrainian auxiliary police. He did not consider that the militiamen might have been involved in the pogroms, although this is what Holocaust scholars generally think.\" Prof. John-Paul Himka referred to him as a type of traditionalists for whom Ukrainians remained an immaculate nation free of any form of wrongdoing in World War II whatsoever.\n\nIn spite of well-proven and widely known historical facts about the Final Solution in the territory of modern-day Ukraine, Nakonechny rejected the notion that Ukrainian nationalists participated in the destruction of the Jews. \"For Nakonechny, it was 'various Ukrainophobes' who manufactured tales about Ukrainian participation in the Holocaust. Anti-Ukrainian ideology is more important for them than historical truth\" according to him.\n\nOver the years Nakonechny wrote many historical publications on history of Ukraine, librarian studies, history of Lviv, Ukrainian - Jewish relations during World War II and others.\n"}
