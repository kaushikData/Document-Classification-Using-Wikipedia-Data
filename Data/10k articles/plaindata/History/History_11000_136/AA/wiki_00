{"id": "1621609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1621609", "title": "Abraham Firkovich", "text": "Abraham Firkovich\n\nAbraham (Avraham) ben Samuel Firkovich (Hebrew אברהם בן שמואל - \"Avraham ben Shmuel\"; Karayce: Аврагъам Фиркович - \"Avragham Firkovich\") (1786–1874) was a famous Karaite writer and archeologist, collector of ancient manuscripts, and a Karaite Hakham. He was born in Lutsk, Volhynia, then lived in Lithuania, and finally settled in Çufut Qale, Crimea. Gabriel Firkovich of Troki was his son-in-law.\n\nAbraham Firkovic was born into a Crimean Karaite farming family in the Lutsk district of Volhynia, then part of the Russian Empire, now Ukraine. At age 25 he went bankrupt. He then began to study Hebrew, Torah and other holy books. In 1818 he was appointed junior hazzan of the Lutsk Crimean Karaites community. Because of a dispute with the older hazzan he had to leave and emigrate to Evpatoria in Crimea, where he was appointed in 1823 to the hacham and the head of the local Crimean Karaites community. In 1825, he sent a letter to the Czar, that proposed to settle the Jewish population from the border of Russia and bring the Jews working the land, but the proposal was rejected. In 1828 he moved to Berdichev, where he met Hasidism and Jewish Scriptures that were unacceptable to the Karaites, such as the Talmud. The encounter with Rabbinical Jews brought Firkovic into conflict with them. He published a book, \"Massah and Meribah\" (Yevpatoria, 1838) which raised serious allegations against the Jewish way of life. In later years when he was reconciled with the Rabbinites, he apologized for the sentiments contained in that pamphlet. In 1830 he visited Jerusalem, where he collected many Jewish manuscripts. On his return he remained two years in Constantinople, as teacher in the Karaite community there. He then went to Crimea and organized a society to publish old Karaite works, of which several appeared in Yevpatoria (Koslov) with comments by him. In 1838 he was the teacher of the children of Sima Babovich, the head of the Russian Crimean Karaites, who one year later recommended him to Count Vorontzov and to the Historical Society of Odessa as a suitable man to send to collect material for the history of the Crimean Karaites. In 1839, Firkovich began excavations in the ancient cemetery of Çufut Qale, and unearthed many old tombstones, claiming that some of them dated from the first centuries of the common era. The following two years were spent in travels through the Caucasus, where he ransacked the genizot of the old Jewish communities and collected many valuable manuscripts. He went as far as Derbent, and returned in 1842. In later years he made other journeys of the same nature, visiting Egypt and other countries. In Odessa he became the friend of Bezalel Stern and of Simchah Pinsker, and while residing in Wilna he made the acquaintance of Samuel Joseph Fuenn and other Hebrew scholars. In 1871 he visited the small Karaite community in Halych, Galicia, where he introduced several reforms. From there he went to Vienna, where he was introduced to Count Beust and also made the acquaintance of Adolph Jellinek. He returned to pass his last days in Çufut Qale, of which there now remained only a few buildings and many ruins. However, Firkovich's house is still preserved in the site.\n\nFirkovich collected a vast number of Hebrew, Arabic and Samaritan manuscripts during his many travels in his search for evidence concerning the traditions of his people. These included thousands of Jewish documents from throughout the Russian Empire in what became known as the First Firkovich Collection. His Second Collection contains material collected from the Near East. His visit took place about thirty years before Solomon Schechter's more famous trip to Egypt. Though this \"Second Firkovich Collection\" contains only 13,700 items in comparison to Schechter's 140,000, the Firkovich documents are generally more complete.\n\nAs a result of his research he became focused on the origin of the ancestors of the Crimean Karaites who he claimed where the descendants of Israelite teachers (mainly from the tribes of Simeon and Levi and their Carian bodyguard from Caphtor) who had arrived in Crimea to convert the natives before the common era (thus not being culpable for the crucifixion of Jesus). His theories persuaded the Russian imperial court that Crimean Karaites cannot be accused in Jesus' Crucifixion and they were excluded from the restrictive measures against Jews.\n\nUpon his death in 1874, Firkovich's collection was bought by the Russian National Library.\n\nAmong the treasures in the Firkovich collection is a manuscript of the \"Garden of Metaphors\", an aesthetic appreciation of Biblical literature written in Judeo-Arabic by one of the greatest of the Sephardi poets, Moses ibn Ezra.\n\nProbably the greatest service that Firkovich rendered to Jewish studies was the awakening of interest in Karaite history and literature, that led to the discussion of his alleged discoveries. His personal contributions to it are mostly of a bibliographical nature, and great caution is necessary in utilizing his materials.\n\nFirkovich's chief work is his \"Abne Zikkaron,\" containing the texts of inscriptions discovered by him (Wilna, 1872). It is preceded by a lengthy account of his travels to Daghestan, characterized by Strack as a mixture of truth and fiction. His other works are \"Ḥotam Toknit,\" antirabbinical polemics, appended to his edition of the \"Mibḥar Yesharim\" by Aaron the elder (Koslov, 1835); \"Ebel Kabod,\" on the death of his wife and of his son Jacob (Odessa, 1866); and \"Bene Reshef\", essays and poems, published by Peretz Smolenskin (Vienna, 1871).\n\nAbraham Firkovich collected several distinct collections of documents. In sum the Firkovich collection contains approximately 15,000 items; of which many are fragmentary.\n\nThis collection contains material from the Crimea and the Caucasus. It was largely collected between 1839 and 1840, but with additions from Firkovich as late as 1852. It was originally owned by the Odessa Society of History and Antiquities and was stored in the Odessa museum.\nSome of these documents deteriorated due to chemical treatment performed by Firkovich. Other documents which were suspected forgeries disappeared; Firkovich claimed they had been stolen. The collection was moved to the Imperial Public Library in 1863.\n\nIn 1844 the Russian historian Arist Kunik, a leading anti-Normanist, and Bezalel Stern, an influential Russian Maskil, would study and partly describe the discovery.\n\nBriefly stated, the discoveries include the major part of the manuscripts described in Pinner's \"Prospectus der Odessaer Gesellschaft für Geschichte und Alterthum Gehörenden Aeltesten Hebräischen und Rabbinischen Manuscripte\" (Odessa, 1845), a rather rare work which is briefly described in \"Literaturblatt des Orients\" for 1847, No. 2. These manuscripts consist of:\n\n\nContains material from the Crimea and the Caucasus largely collected between 1839 and 1841. It was purchased by the Imperial Public Library in 1862.\n\nAnother collection of 317 Samaritan manuscripts, acquired in Nablus, arrived in the St. Petersburg Imperial Academy in 1867 (see Fürst, \"Geschichte des Karäerthums\", iii. pp. 176, Leipsic, 1869)\n\nIn 1864 Firkovich acquired a large collection of Samaritan documents in Nablus. He sold the documents to the Imperial Public Library in 1870. In sum the collection contains 1,350 items.\n\nContains material collected from the Near East. The material was collected between 1863 and 1865. Firkovich collected in Jerusalem, Aleppo and also in Cairo. Firkovich concealed where he obtained the documents. He possibly collected from the Cairo Geniza thirty years before Solomon Schechter discovered it. Firkovich sold this collection to the Imperial Public Library in 1873.\n\nFirkovich has come to be regarded as a forger, acting in support of Karaite causes. He wished to eliminate any connection between Rabbinic Judaism and the Karaites by declaring that the Karaites were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes. Firkovich successfully petitioned the Russian government to exempt the Karaites from anti-Jewish laws on the grounds that Karaites had immigrated to Europe before the crucifixion of Jesus and thus could not be held responsible for his death.\n\nS. L. Rapoport has pointed out some impossibilities in the inscriptions (\"Ha-Meliẓ,\" 1861, Nos. 13-15, 37); A. Geiger in his \"Jüdische Zeitschrift\" (1865, p. 166), Schorr in \"He-Ḥaluẓ,\" and A. Neubauer in the \"Journal Asiatique\" (1862–63) and in his \"Aus der Petersburger Bibliothek\" (Leipzig, 1866) have challenged the correctness of the facts and the theories based upon them which Jost, Julius Fürst, and Heinrich Grätz, in their writings on the Karaites, took from Pinsker's \"Liḳḳuṭe Ḳadmoniyyot,\" in which the data furnished by Firkovich were unhesitatingly accepted. Further exposures were made by Strack and Harkavy (St. Petersburg, 1875) in the \"Catalog der Hebr. Bibelhandschriften der Kaiserlichen Oeffentlichen Bibliothek in St. Petersburg\"; in Harkavy's \"Altjüdische Denkmäler aus der Krim\" (ib. 1876); in Strack's \"A. Firkowitsch und Seine Entdeckungen\" (Leipsic, 1876); in Fränkel's \"Aḥare Reshet le-Baḳḳer\" (\"Ha-Shaḥar,\" vii.646 et seq.); in Deinard's \"Massa' Ḳrim\" (Warsaw, 1878); and in other places. \n\nIn contradiction, Firkovich's most sympathetic critic, Chwolson, gives as a résumé of his belief, after considering all controversies, that Firkovich succeeded in demonstrating that some of the Jewish tombstones from Chufut-Kale date back to the seventh century, and that seemingly modern forms of eulogy and the method of counting after the era of creation were in vogue among Jews much earlier than had been hitherto suspected. Chwolson alone defended him, but he also was forced to admit that in some cases Firkovich had resorted to forgery. In his \"Corpus Inscriptionum Hebraicarum\" (St. Petersburg, 1882; Russian ed., ib. 1884) Chwolson attempts to prove that the Firkovich collection, especially the epitaphs from tombstones, contains much which is genuine.\n\nIn 1980, V. V. Lebedev investigated the Firkovich collection and came to the conclusion that forgery cannot be attributed to Firkovich, but rather it was done by the previous owners, in an attempt to increase the price of the manuscripts.\n\nFor many years the manuscripts were not available to Western scholars. The extent of Firkovich’s forgeries is still being determined. Firkovich’s materials require careful examination on a case by case basis. His collection remains of great value to scholars of Jewish studies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21295163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21295163", "title": "African-American heritage of presidents of the United States", "text": "African-American heritage of presidents of the United States\n\nThe African-American heritage of United States presidents relates mostly to questions and claims made by amateur historians as to whether five presidents of the United States who were accepted as white also had significant recent African ancestry. There is no disagreement that President Barack Obama (2009–2017) had a Kenyan father and an American mother of mostly European ancestry. (She and Obama are thought also to be descended from the African indentured servant known in colonial records as John Punch.) The academic consensus of historians is that no president other than Obama has had recent (from the colonial period in U.S. history or after) African ancestry; it rejects claims to the contrary.\n\nThese claims have been made by the historian William Estabrook Chancellor, amateur historian J. A. Rogers, ophthalmologist Leroy William Vaughn, and Auset BaKhufu. All but Chancellor base their theories chiefly on the work of J. A. Rogers, who apparently self-published a pamphlet in 1965 claiming that five presidents of the United States, widely accepted as white, also had African ancestry. Vaughn's and BaKhufu's books also appear to have been self-published.\n\nHistorians' and biographers' studies of these presidents have not supported such claims, nor have the claims been published in any peer-reviewed journal. These authors are generally ignored by scholars. They repeat each other's material and are classified as \"rumormongers and amateur historians.\" Vaughn and BaKhufu have added little substantive research to their claims, although there has been extensive new documentation of race relations by others in the decades since Rogers published his pamphlet.\n\nCitizenship and associated claims have split on two dimensions: formal legal citizenship, and full social and political citizenship. While claims of African ancestry may have created social scandal (and that varied in time and place), even in Thomas Jefferson's time, a person of less than one-quarter African ancestry could be considered legally white. Later this was changed so that a person had to have at least seven-eighths European ancestry to be legally white. Jefferson's mixed-race children from his relationship with Sally Hemings, were seven-eighths white. There is ample evidence in historical records that people of mixed race were accepted as white and full citizens in communities, as they were documented as exercising the rights of citizens to bear arms and vote. Social acceptance by the majority-white community was often the key as to whether a person was considered white, more than details about ancestry, especially in early periods on the frontier when few records were kept and people often did not know much about their origins.\n\nThis classification of ancestry and social class was separate from the legal status derived from \"partus sequitur ventrem\", the law that made children born to slave mothers also slaves. This law hardened slavery as a racial caste system. But, it was not until after the end of slavery and regaining of power by conservative whites in the late 19th-century South that they passed laws to create racial segregation and Jim Crow. From 1890 to 1908, southern states of the former Confederacy passed constitutional amendments and legislation making voter registration more difficult, essentially disfranchising most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites. Such disfranchisement essentially lasted until the civil rights movement gained Congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to protect constitutional rights of citizens to vote.\n\nIn the early 20th century, southern states tried to find more ways to enforce segregation. Beginning with Tennessee in 1910, through Oklahoma in 1931, most southern states adopted the one-drop rule, and hardened racial lines so that a person of any African ancestry was to be recorded as and considered as black in the binary society. During the same period, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Utah retained their old \"blood fraction\" statutes \"de jure\", but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirty-second) to be equivalent to one-drop \"de facto.\"\n\nIn recent decades, United States historians have more thoroughly explored the years of slavery and opened up discussion of race relations. They have noted that numerous mixed-race families of varying proportions of European and African ancestry developed in colonial and antebellum United States. In award-winning research, Paul Heinegg traced the ancestry of free black families in North Carolina in the 1790 census, finding that most were descended from free people of color in colonial Virginia who migrated to other areas. They were mostly descendants of unions between white women, indentured servant or free, and African men, slave, indentured or free, from years when associations among the working class were fluid. The historian Dr. Ira Berlin praised Heinegg's \"meticulous research\" in his Foreword to his work. Because the white women were free, their mixed-race children were born free.\n\nNell Irvin Painter examined issues of power in \"Southern History Across the Color Line\" (2002). Joshua Rothman looked closely at antebellum Virginia and numerous mixed-race families in \"Notorious in the Neighborhood: Sex and Families across the Color Line in Virginia, 1787–1861\" (2003). In two books, the scholar Annette Gordon-Reed showed how historians had ignored evidence of Thomas Jefferson's and Sally Hemings' long affair and mixed-race children, who were seven-eighths white. In her deep research, however, she did not support claims that Jefferson was of mixed-race descent. DNA studies in 1998 showed a match between the Jefferson male line and a descendant of Eston Hemings, leading experts to conclude that Jefferson was likely the father of Hemings' children. The Thomas Jefferson Foundation agrees that the weight of historical evidence supports this conclusion.\n\nPresident Barack Obama had a Kenyan father and an American mother of mostly European ancestry. A conspiracy theory arose over whether Obama was born in the U.S., a claim generally being that he was born in Africa, which might have denied him the right to be President even if elected. Drawing on a combination of historical documents and Y-DNA analysis, Ancestry.com stated in July 2012 that it is a strong likelihood that Obama is an eleventh great-grandson of the African John Punch, who was formerly an indentured servant and later a slave, through his mother Stanley Ann Dunham. Punch lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.\n\nNone of the claims below have been verified by reliable sources in peer-reviewed publications. Mainline historians do not support these claims.\n\nVaughn and others claim Thomas Jefferson's mother Jane Randolph Jefferson was of mixed-race ancestry. The academic consensus does not support such claims. In her recent analyses of historical evidence about the Hemings and Jeffersons, for example, the scholar Annette Gordon-Reed makes no claim of African descent in the Randolph family.\n\nSpecifically, Vaughn says, \"The chief attack on Jefferson was in a book written by Thomas Hazard in 1867 called \"The Johnny Cake Papers\". Hazard interviewed Paris Gardiner, who said he was present during the 1796 presidential campaign, when one speaker states that Thomas Jefferson was a mean-spirited son of a half-breed Indian squaw and a Virginia mulatto father.\" An overlapping claim is that, in an 18th-century Presidential campaign, someone speaking against Jefferson's candidacy and in favor of that of John Adams accused Jefferson of being \"half Injun, half nigger, half Frenchman\" and born to a \"mulatto father\" or slave and \"a half-breed Indian squaw\", this birth to a mulatto and an Indian allegedly \"well-known in the neighbourhood where he was raised\" but otherwise unproven. Vaughn also quoted biographer Samuel Sloan's statement that there was \"something strange\" about Thomas Jefferson's reportedly destroying papers and personal effects of his mother Jane Randolph Jefferson after her death. That is the extent of his evidence.\n\nThe Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which owns and operates Monticello, the major public history site on Jefferson, characterizes Jefferson's parents this way: \"His father Peter Jefferson was a successful planter and surveyor and his mother Jane Randolph a member of one of Virginia's most distinguished families.\" They describe the quote in \"The Johnny Cake Papers\" as one frequently repeated, but it is attributed in written sources to the 1800 rather than the 1796 election campaign and clearly is one made by political opponents. \"The Johnny Cake Papers\" were a collection of folk tales published in 1879, not 1867, and only one tale commented on Jefferson. The Foundation states:\n\nTo date we have not found this quotation in any sources contemporary to the election of 1800. Its earliest known appearance in print is actually in a collection of New England folk tales, \"The Johnny-Cake Papers\". First published in 1879, the stories told date in many cases back to the beginning of the 19th century, while others are thought to be even older. The reference in question appears in the \"Seventeenth Baking,\" in which a \"most veracious stump orator from Providence\" spoke expansively on the achievements of [president] John Adams,\n\n\nDixon Wecter, in his essay \"Thomas Jefferson, The Gentle Radical,\" discusses various portrayals of Jefferson by his political enemies, and mentions that \"the Jonnycake [sic] Papers later burlesqued such caricatures...\"\n\nAndrew Jackson referred to a charge that his \"Mother ... [was] held to public scorn as a prostitute who intermarried with a Negro, and [that his] ... eldest brother [was] sold as a slave in Carolina.\" Less specific was a rumor of Jackson having \"colored blood\", meaning having \"Negro\" ancestry; this rumor was unproven. President Jackson's father was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, in current-day Northern Ireland, around 1738. Scholars Hendrik Booraem, Robert Remini, and H. W. Brands are agreed he had no black ancestors.\n\nAbraham Lincoln's mother Nancy Hanks was claimed to be of African descent.\n\nAccording to historian William E. Barton, a rumor \"current in various forms in several sections of the South\" was that Lincoln's biological father was Abraham Enloe, which Barton dismissed as \"false\". According to Doug Wead, Enloe publicly denied this connection to Lincoln but is reported to have privately confirmed it. Another claim was that Lincoln was \"part Negro\", but that was unproven. Mail received by Lincoln called him \"a negro\" and a \"mulatto\". Thomas Lincoln's \"complexion [was] swarthy\". According to Lincoln's law partner William H. Herndon, Lincoln had \"very dark skin\" although \"his cheeks were leathery and saffron-colored\" and \"his face was ... sallow,\" and \"his hair was dark, almost black\". Abraham Lincoln described himself \"ca.\" 1838–'39 as \"black\" and his \"complexion\" in 1859 as \"dark\" but whether he meant either in an ancestral sense is unknown. The Charleston \"Mercury\" described him as being \"of ... the dirtiest complexion\".\n\nWarren G. Harding was said to have African ancestry; one claim was by his political opponent, a controversial and racist historian, William Estabrook Chancellor. Chancellor said Harding's father was a mulatto and Harding's great-grandmother was black. During Harding's campaign, Democratic opponents spread rumors that Harding's great-great-grandfather was a West Indian black and that other blacks might be found in his family tree. Chancellor publicized rumors, based on supposed family research, but perhaps reflecting no more than local gossip. In an era when the \"one-drop rule\" would classify a person with any African ancestry as black, and black people in the South had been effectively disenfranchised, Harding's campaign manager responded, \"no family in the state (of Ohio) has a clearer, a more honorable record than the Hardings', a blue-eyed stock from New England and Pennsylvania, the finest pioneer blood.\" \"Many biographers have dismissed the rumors of Harding's mixed-race family as little more than a political scandal and Chancellor himself as a Democratic mudslinger and racist ideologue.\" According to Chancellor, Harding got his only academic degree from Iberia College, which had been \"founded to educate fugitive slaves.\" The college was founded by abolitionist supporters in the Presbyterian Church in Ohio for students of both genders and all races. \nWhen asked directly about Chancellor's account, Harding did not make any effort to deny that he may have had an African-American ancestor. He said he did not know and demonstrated that it was not a significant issue.\n\nThe rumors may have been sustained by a statement Harding allegedly made to newspaperman James W. Faulkner on the subject, which he perhaps meant to be dismissive: \"How do I know, Jim? One of my ancestors may have jumped the fence.\" However, while there are gaps in the historical record, studies of his family tree have not found evidence of an African-American ancestor.\n\nIn 2015 genetic testing of Harding's descendants determined, with more than a 95% percent chance of accuracy, that he lacked sub-Saharan African forebears within four previous generations.\n\nCalvin Coolidge's mother Victoria Moor was claimed to be of a mixed-race family in Vermont. Vaughn noted that her surname was derived from \"Moor\", a European term for people of North Africa. He did not note that another meaning of her surname is the landscape feature of moor or bog. People's surnames were often based on such landscape features when surnames became generally adopted in 14th century England. Moor/Moore is a common name in England, Scotland, and Ireland.\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower's mother was said to be of mixed blood from Africa and mulatto. However, historians and biographers of Eisenhower had documented his parents' German, Swiss and English ancestry and long history in America. Some of his immigrant ancestors settled in Pennsylvania in 1741 and after, migrated west to Kansas.\n\nBefore the Constitution of the United States was drafted, John Hanson was one of the Presidents of the Continental Congress, and thus not considered one of the Presidents of the United States by mainstream historians. Though he was a white man from Maryland, a false claim has circulated on the Internet claiming that he was actually the first Black President of the United States, the claim including that the black President Hanson appears on the back of the United States two-dollar bill, but that confused the white Hanson with Senator John Hanson, an African-American man with the same name who helped colonize Liberia, while the face on the two-dollar bill is that of Thomas Heyward, Jr., a white man whose face is in shadow in the portrait reproduced on the currency.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt had an ancestor born in North Africa. His ancestor Henry Smith was born to English parents Col. William \"Tangier\" and Martha (Tunstall) Smith in Tangier in present-day Morocco on 19 Jan. 1678/9. While Smith's parents were married in Tangier in 1675, they were both born in England and were of European ancestry. The Mayorship of Tangiers held by Col. William Smith has been used by his descendants to distinguish themselves from other Smith through use of the compound surname Tangiers Smith ever since.\n\n\n"}

Later migrations out of the Fertile Crescent would carry early agricultural practices to neighboring regions—westward to Europe and North Africa, northward to Crimea, and eastward to Mongolia.\n\nThe ancient people of the Sahara imported domesticated animals from Asia between 6000 and 4000 BCE. In Nabta Playa by the end of the 7th millennium BCE, prehistoric Egyptians had imported goats and sheep from Southwest Asia.\n\nForeign artifacts dating to the 5th millennium BCE in the Badarian culture in Egypt indicate contact with distant Syria. In predynastic Egypt, by the beginning of the 4th millennium BCE, ancient Egyptians in Maadi were importing pottery as well as construction ideas from Canaan.\n\nBy the 4th millennium BCE shipping was well established, and the donkey and possibly the dromedary had been domesticated. Domestication of the Bactrian camel and use of the horse for transport then followed. Charcoal samples found in the tombs of Nekhen, which were dated to the Naqada I and II periods, have been identified as cedar from Lebanon. Predynastic Egyptians of the Naqada I period also imported obsidian from Ethiopia, used to shape blades and other objects from flakes. The Naqadans traded with Nubia to the south, the oases of the western desert to the west, and the cultures of the eastern Mediterranean to the east.\n\nPottery and other artifacts from the Levant that date to the Naqadan era have been found in ancient Egypt. Egyptian artifacts dating to this era have been found in Canaan and other regions of the Near East, including Tell Brak and Uruk and Susa in Mesopotamia.\n\nBy the second half of the 4th millennium BCE, the gemstone lapis lazuli was being traded from its only known source in the ancient world—Badakhshan, in what is now northeastern Afghanistan—as far as Mesopotamia and Egypt. By the 3rd millennium BCE, the lapis lazuli trade was extended to Harappa, Lothal and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley Civilization of modern-day Pakistan and northwestern India. The Indus Valley was also known as Meluhha, the earliest maritime trading partner of the Sumerians and Akkadians in Mesopotamia. The ancient harbor constructed in Lothal, India, around 2400 BCE is the oldest seafaring harbour known.\n\nThe overland route through the Wadi Hammamat from the Nile to the Red Sea was known as early as predynastic times; drawings depicting Egyptian reed boats have been found along the path dating to 4000 BCE. Ancient cities dating to the First Dynasty of Egypt arose along both its Nile and Red Sea junctions, testifying to the route's ancient popularity. It became a major route from Thebes to the Red Sea port of Elim, where travelers then moved on to either Asia, Arabia or the Horn of Africa. Records exist documenting knowledge of the route among Senusret I, Seti, Ramesses IV and also, later, the Roman Empire, especially for mining.\n\nThe Darb el-Arbain trade route, passing through Kharga in the south and Asyut in the north, was used from as early as the Old Kingdom of Egypt for the transport and trade of gold, ivory, spices, wheat, animals and plants. Later, Ancient Romans would protect the route by lining it with varied forts and small outposts, some guarding large settlements complete with cultivation. Described by Herodotus as a road \"traversed ... in forty days,\" it became by his time an important land route facilitating trade between Nubia and Egypt. Its maximum extent was northward from Kobbei, 25 miles north of al-Fashir, passing through the desert, through Bir Natrum and Wadi Howar, and ending in Egypt.\n\nShipbuilding was known to the Ancient Egyptians as early as 3000 BCE, and perhaps earlier. Ancient Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull, with woven straps used to lash the planks together, and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams. The Archaeological Institute of America reports that the earliest dated ship—75 feet long, dating to 3000 BCE—may have possibly belonged to Pharaoh Aha.\n\nAn Egyptian colony stationed in southern Canaan dates to slightly before the First Dynasty. Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan—with his name stamped on vessels—and exported back to Egypt, from regions such as Arad, En Besor, Rafiah, and Tel Erani. In 1994 excavators discovered an incised ceramic shard with the serekh sign of Narmer, dating to c. 3000 BCE. Mineralogical studies reveal the shard to be a fragment of a wine jar exported from the Nile valley to Palestine.\nDue to Egypt's climate, wine was very rare and nearly impossible to produce within the limits of Egypt. In order to obtain wine, Egyptians had to import it from Greece, Phoenicia, and Palestine. These early friendships played a key role in Egypt's ability to conduct trade and acquire goods that were needed.\nThe Palermo stone mentions King Sneferu of the 4th Dynasty sending ships to import high-quality cedar from Lebanon. In one scene in the pyramid of Pharaoh Sahure of the Fifth Dynasty, Egyptians are returning with huge cedar trees. Sahure's name is found stamped on a thin piece of gold on a Lebanon chair, and 5th dynasty cartouches were found in Lebanon stone vessels. Other scenes in his temple depict Syrian bears. The Palermo stone also mentions expeditions to Sinai as well as to the diorite quarries northwest of Abu Simbel.\n\nThe oldest known expedition to the Land of Punt was organized by Sahure, which apparently yielded a quantity of myrrh, along with malachite and electrum. Around 1950 BCE, in the reign of Mentuhotep III, an officer named Hennu made one or more voyages to Punt. In the 15th century BCE, Nehsi conducted a very famous expedition for Queen Hatshepsut to obtain myrrh; a report of that voyage survives on a relief in Hatshepsut's funerary temple at Deir el-Bahri. Several of her successors, including Thutmoses III, also organized expeditions to Punt.\n\nThe legendary Sesostris (likely either Pharaoh Senusret II or Senusret III of the Twelfth dynasty of Egypt) is said to have started work on an ancient \"Suez\" Canal joining the River Nile with the Red Sea. This ancient account is corroborated by Aristotle, Pliny the Elder, and Strabo.\n\nOne of their kings tried to make a canal to it (for it would have been of no little advantage to them for the whole region to have become navigable; Sesostris is said to have been the first of the ancient kings to try), but he found that the sea was higher than the land. So he first, and Darius afterwards, stopped making the canal, lest the sea should mix with the river water and spoil it.\n\n165. Next comes the Tyro tribe and, on the Red Sea, the harbour of the Daneoi, from which Sesostris, king of Egypt, intended to carry a ship-canal to where the Nile flows into what is known as the Delta; this is a distance of over 60 miles. Later the Persian king Darius had the same idea, and yet again Ptolemy II, who made a trench 100 feet wide, 30 feet deep and about 35 miles long, as far as the Bitter Lakes.\n\nRemnants of an ancient west-east canal, running through the ancient Egyptian cities of Bubastis, Pi-Ramesses, and Pithom were discovered by Napoleon Bonaparte and his cadre of engineers and cartographers in 1799. Other evidence seems to indicate the existence of an ancient canal around the 13th century BC, during the time of Ramesses II. Later construction efforts continued during the reigns of Necho II, Darius I of Persia and Ptolemy II Philadelphus.\n\n\"Psammetichus left a son called Necos, who succeeded him upon the throne. This prince was the first to attempt the construction of the canal to the Red Sea—a work completed afterwards by Darius the Persian—the length of which is four days’ journey, and the width is such as to admit of two triremes being rowed along it abreast. The water is derived from the Nile, which the canal leaves a little above the city of Bubastis, near Patumus, the Arabian town, being continued thence until it joins the Red Sea.\" \n\n\"This [the canal from the Nile to the Red Sea] was begun by Necho II [610 BCE – 595 BCE], and completed by Darius I, who set up stelae c. 490 [BCE], ... and later restored by Ptolemy II Philadelphus, Trajan and Hadrian, and Amr ibn el-'Asi, the Muslim conqueror of Egypt. Its length from Tell el-Maskhuta to Suez was about .\n\nShipping over the Nile River and from Old Cairo and through Suez continued further through the efforts of either 'Amr ibn al-'As, Omar the Great, or Trajan. The Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur is said to have ordered this ancient canal closed so as to prevent supplies from reaching Arabian detractors.\n"}

The calendar is largely based on an older version of the Hindu calendar though unlike the Indian systems, it employs a version of the Metonic cycle. The calendar therefore has to reconcile the sidereal years of the Hindu calendar with Metonic cycle's tropical years by adding intercalary months and intercalary days on irregular intervals.\n\nAlthough the name \"Culāsakaraj\" is a generic term meaning \"Lesser Era\" in Pali, the term \"Chula Sakarat\" is often associated with the various versions of the calendar used in regions that make up modern-day Thailand. The calendar is used in Myanmar and the Sipsong Panna area of China. In Thailand, it is only used in academia for Thai history studies.\n\nThe name Chula Sakarat is a loan translation from the Thai, which itself is derived from Pali \"culā\" \"small\" and Sanskrit \"śaka\" + \"rāja\", literally meaning \"Scythian king\" (the meaning was thought and held to be \"era\" by some of those having adopted the Indianised culture in Indochina, including the Thais).\n\nIn Thailand, this era is used in contrast with the Shalivahana era, commonly known in Southeast Asia as \"Mahāsakaraj\" or the Great or Major Era (, ; ; ).\n\nThe calendar was launched in 640 CE in Sri Ksetra Kingdom (in modern Myanmar) with the epochal year 0 date of 22 March 638. It was largely a recalibration of then prevailing Mahasakaraj or Saka Era. It was later adopted by the Pagan Kingdom. According to the Chiang Mai Chronicles and the Chiang Saen Chronicles, Chiang Mai, Chiang Saen and their tributary states of middle and upper Tai country (except Lamphun and Sukhothai) submitted to King Anawrahta and adopted the calendar in the mid-11th century in place of Mahasakaraj, the standard calendar of the Khmer Empire. However, scholarship says the earliest evidence of Burmese calendar in modern Thailand dates only to mid-13th century.\n\nThe use of the calendar appears to have spread southward to the Sukhothai and eastward to Laotian states in the following centuries. The official adoption farther south by the Ayutthaya Kingdom and farther east by Lan Xang came only after King Bayinnaung's conquests of those kingdoms in the 16th century. Subsequent Siamese kingdoms retained the Burmese calendar as the official calendar under the name of \"Chula Sakarat\" (Culasakaraj) until 1889.\n\nThe calendar fell out of use throughout the region in the second half of the 19th century with the advent of European colonialism. The only remaining independent state Siam too dropped the calendar on 1 April 1889 per King Chulalongkorn (Rama V)'s decree. It was replaced by Rattanakosin Era. Today, the calendar is used purely for cultural and religious festivals in Myanmar. Thailand has moved on to its own version of Buddhist calendar since 1941 although the Chula Sakarat era dates remain the most commonly used and preferred form of entry by the academia for Thai history studies.\n\nVarious regional versions of Chula Sakarat/Burmese calendar existed across various regions of mainland Southeast Asia. Unlike Burmese systems, Sipsong Panna, Kengtung, Lan Na, Lan Xang and Sukhothai systems refer to the months by numbers, not by names . This means reading ancient texts and inscriptions in Thailand requires constant vigilance, not just in making sure one is correctly operating for the correct region, but also for variations within regions itself when incursions cause a variation in practice. However, Cambodian (Khmer) month system, which begins with Margasirsa as the first month, demonstrated precisely by the names and numbers.\n\nNote: The Sukhothai and Lan Xang numbering systems and the now abandoned Burmese numbering system are the same.\n\nCambodian and Thai systems give animal names to the years from a cycle of 12. The practice also existed in Burma but had died out by the 17th century. In March 1638, King Thalun of Burma rejected the proposal by King Prasat Thong of Siam to change the animal names of the calendar months because the animal naming system was no longer in use in Burma.\n\nChula Sakarat, like the Burmese calendar, was largely based on the Hindu calendar, an older version of \"Surya Siddhanta\". However, unlike Hindu calendar, it also uses a 19-year Metonic cycle. In order to reconcile the sidereal months of Hindu calendar with Metonic cycle's solar years, the calendar inserts intercalary months and days on some schedule.\n\nThe Siamese system uses three similar but not identical types of lunar years used by the Burmese system. Each calendar has the same regular year of 354 days and a leap year of 384 days. However, whereas the Burmese calendar adds the intercalary day only in a leap cycle according to its Metonic cycle, the Siamese calendar adds the intercalary day to a regular year. The Siamese calendar does add the extra day in the same place (Jyestha/Nayon), however.\n\nDown to the mid-19th century, the Burmese calendar and its Siamese cousin both used the \"Surya\" method. But between 1840 and 1853, Konbaung Dynasty switched to what it believed was a more accurate method called \"Thandeikta\" (a hybrid of the old \"Surya\" and an updated version of \"Surya\" from India). Thandeikta introduced a slightly longer solar year (0.56 second a year longer than the old system) and a slightly longer lunar month that produces a smaller gap between the two. However, it has turned out that the new system is actually slightly \"less\" accurate (0.56 second a year) than the old system in terms of the drift from the scientifically measured tropical year. At any rate, the old and the new systems are 23 minutes 50.8704 seconds and 23 minutes 51.4304 seconds respectively ahead of the actual tropical year. The error continues to mount.\n\nSince the Thandeikta system not only does not solve but actually increases the accumulating drift issue, Burmese calendarists have resorted to periodically modifying the intercalation schedule of the Metonic cycle, starting in 1839 CE, using apparent reckoning. The fixed Metonic cycle remained in place in Siam.\n\n\n"}

He was said to be tall, handsome but shy. He was accused of being a Catholic sympathiser whilst it remained illegal, and joined the newly created Scottish Episcopal Church, close in practice to the Catholic Church. Dean Ramsay, head of the Episcopal Church, was one of his friends.\n\nBorn in Durris Castle to Euphemia Russell and John Innes of Leuchars WS.

He was buried on 5 August at Warriston Cemetery in Edinburgh. The grave lies on the east side of the main west path, just beyond the large Celtic cross to Horatio McCulloch. Given that Innes was one of the richest persons in Edinburgh, the gravestone is exceptionally modest.\n\nHe was the author of \"Memoir of Thomas Thomson, Advocate\" (1854), \"Scotland in the Middle Ages\" (1860), \"Sketches of Early Scottish History\" (1861), \"Lectures on Scotch Legal Antiquities\" (1872) and \"Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character\" (1875, co-written with Dean Ramsay)).

In a more restricted sense, the Indies can be used to refer to the islands of Southeast Asia, especially the Indonesian Archipelago and the Philippine Archipelago. The name \"Indies\" is derived from the River Indus and is used to connote parts of Asia that came under Indian cultural influence.\n\nDutch-occupied colonies in the area were known for about 300 years as the Dutch East Indies before Indonesian independence, while Spanish-occupied colonies were known as the Spanish East Indies before the American conquest and later Philippine independence. The East Indies may also include the former French-occupied Indochina, former British territories Brunei and Singapore and former Portuguese East Timor. It does not, however, include the former Dutch New Guinea western New Guinea (West Papua), which is geographically considered to be part of Melanesia.\n\nThe inhabitants of the East Indies are almost never called East Indians, distinguishing them both from inhabitants of the Caribbean (which is also called the West Indies) and from the indigenous peoples of the Americas who are often called \"American Indians.\" In colonial times they were just \"natives\". However, the peoples of the East Indies comprise a wide variety of cultural diversity, and the inhabitants do not consider themselves as belonging to a single ethnic group. Buddhism, Islam, Christianity and Hinduism are the most popular religions throughout the region, while Sikhism, Jainism, Chinese folk religion and various other traditional beliefs and practices are also prominent in some areas. The major languages in this area draw from a wide variety of language families, and should not be confused with the term Indic, which refers only to a group of Indo-Iranian languages from South Asia.\n\nThe extensive East Indies are subdivided into two sections (from a European perspective), archaically called Hither India and Further India. The first is the former British India, the second is Southeast Asia.\n\nRegions of the East Indies are sometimes known by the colonial empire they once belonged to, hence, \"British East Indies\" refers to Malaysia, \"Dutch East Indies\" means Indonesia, and \"Spanish East Indies\" means the Philippines.\n\nHistorically, the king of Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) was identified with \"Prester John of the Indies\", since that part of the world was imagined to be one of \"Three Indias\".\n\nExploration of these regions by European powers first began in the late 15th century and early 16th century led by the Portuguese explorers. The Portuguese described the entire region they discovered as the \"Indies\". Eventually, the region would be broken up into a series of \"Indies\": The East Indies, which was also called \"Old Indies\" or \"Great Indies\", consisting of India, and the West Indies, also called \"New Indies\" or \"Little Indies\", consisting of the Americas.\n\nThese regions were important sources of trading goods, particularly cotton, indigo and spices after the establishment of European trading companies: the British East India Company and Dutch East India Company, among others, in the 17th century.\n\nThe New World was initially thought to be the easternmost part of the \"Indies\" by explorer Christopher Columbus, who had grossly underestimated the westerly distance from Europe to Asia. Later, to avoid confusion, the New World came to be called the \"West Indies\", while the original Indies came to be called the \"East Indies\".\n\nThe designation \"East Indian\" was once primarily used to describe people of all of the East Indies, in order to avoid the potential confusion from the term American Indian who were once simply referred to as \"Indians\" (see the Native American name controversy for more information).\n\n"}

Feminist art publishing in the 1980s,\" was included in the 1995 book \"\".\n\nHer book first published in 1998, \"Seeing Ourselves: Women's Self Portraits\" discusses women creating their own images and the power of self-portrait rather than being portrayed as objects, as well as a historical look at gender, identity and representation. The book is an in-depth look at history, starting with the self-portraits of Medieval nuns and eventually ending in the 21st century, the book is acknowledging themes in the self portraits including motherhood, female beauty, musical talents as seen in early work and in the 20th century themes of sexuality, pain, race, gender and disease. Some artists in the book \"Seeing Ourselves: Women's Self Portraits\" include: Judith Leyster, Anna Dorothea Therbusch, Marie-Nicole Dumont, Hortense Haudebourt-Lescot, Suzanne Valadon, Gwen John, Paula Modersohn-Becker, Charlotte Berend-Corinth, Frida Kahlo, Wanda Wulz, Charlotte Salomon, Judy Chicago, Jo Spence, Hannah Wilke, Carolee Schneemann, Cindy Sherman, Tracey Emin and more. The 2016 edition of \"Seeing Ourselves: Women's Self Portraits\" is fully revised and includes a new afterword by the author about selfies.\n\nThe 2010 book, \"Frida Kahlo: Face to Face\" was co-authored with American artist Judy Chicago, and focused on Frida Kahlo's career as well as Kahlo's artwork in relation to topics like female self portraiture and commercialization.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The golden number of any Julian or Gregorian calendar year can be calculated by dividing the year by 19, taking the remainder, and adding 1.

The IIC seeks to promote the knowledge, methods and working standards needed to protect and preserve historic and artistic works throughout the world.\n\nIIC is an independent international organisation supported by individual and institutional members. It is a forum for communication among those professionals who have responsibility for the preservation of cultural heritage. It aims to advance knowledge, practice and standards for the conservation of historic and artistic works through its publications and conferences. It also promotes professional excellence and public awareness through its awards and scholarships.\n\nThe current Council of the institute (2018-2019) is:\n\nOfficers:\n\nOrdinary Members of Council:\n\nIIC's Council attempts to reflect the geographical and professional balance of the worldwide conservation profession. Council Members, including the Secretary-General and Treasurer, are volunteers, as are the editors of \"Studies in Conservation\" and IIC's Congress preprints. The institute has a permanent secretariat in London with a staff of four.\n\nIIC co-operates closely with other organisations in the field, notably the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property and the Committee for Conservation of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) as well as national and regional conservation groups.\n\nIIC is a learned society and is also registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales.\n\nIn 1930, the International Museums Office of the League of Nations held a conference in Rome on the examination and conservation of works of art. Following this meeting, the Museums Office issued a series of publications on the subject. In 1932 a technical journal of conservation studies, \"Technical Studies in the Field of the Fine Arts\", was established by the Fogg Museum (Harvard University), under the managing editorship of George L. Stout. It continued publication until 1942.\n\nThe repatriation of art treasures after World War II brought together experts from Europe and the United States. They proposed the revival of \"Technical Studies\" and the formation of an international body of conservators to continue the interchange of information on the care and conservation of works of art. Between 1946 and 1948 a series of meetings was held to discuss these proposals. Foremost among those involved in the meetings were George L. Stout, W.G. Constable (Boston), Ian Rawlins (London), and Paul Coremans (Brussels).\n\nIn December 1948 at a meeting of the ICOM Commission on the Care of Paintings in London, it was announced that a new international institute for conservation was about to be incorporated with offices in London and that its interests would be the scientific and technical study of the subject.\n\nOn April 27, 1950, the International Institute for the Conservation of Museum Objects (which acquired its present name in 1959) was incorporated as a limited company in the United Kingdom. Its aims were \"to improve the state of knowledge and standards of practice and to provide a common meeting ground and publishing body for all who are interested in and professionally skilled in the conservation of museum objects”. The Institute was to be concerned with:\n\nThe office was established with the help of a grant from the Nuffield Foundation. London was chosen as the \"midpoint\" between the United States and continental Europe. Office space was provided free by the Trustees of the National Gallery (London). The Institute moved to its own independent offices in 1968.\n\nThe membership was to consist of Fellows who were to be persons highly qualified in (or in positions of great authority in) conservation and Associates who were to be \"persons anxious to promote the objects of the Institute\". Later a category of Institutional Members was introduced.\n\nWhen the IIC was founded in 1950, the Founder Fellows were George L. Stout, Rutherford J. Gettens, Richard Buck, W.G. Constable, Murray Pease, Ian Rawlins, Harold Plenderleith, Sir Wallace Akers (chairman of ICI), Helmut Ruhemann, and Paul Coremans. Others who joined in that first year included Arthur van Schendel, René Sneyers, and Sheldon and Caroline Keck. Stout became the IIC's first President, with Plenderleith its Treasurer and Rawlins its Secretary-General.\n\nThe IIC membership grew quickly. In October 1952 there were 62 members (38 of them Fellows) with 64 candidates for associate membership in process of election; by March 1952, there were 167 members (50 of them Fellows).\n\n\n\nIn May 1952, the first issue of the \"IIC Newsletter\" appeared; this later became the \"IIC Bulletin\" and in turn was succeeded in 2007 by \"News in Conservation\". In October 1952, \"Studies in Conservation\" began publication. \"IIC Abstracts\", an international journal of abstracts of the technical literature and the forerunner of \"Art and Archaeology Technical Abstracts\", was first published in 1955. With changing editorship, it ran for five volumes ending with Vol.5, no.4 (Autumn 1965). In 2000, the first volume of the annual \"Reviews in Conservation\" was published.\n\n\"Studies in Conservation\" is a peer-reviewed academic journal, produced eight times a year, on the conservation of historic and artistic works. \"Studies in Conservation\" publishes original work on a range of subjects including, but not limited to, advances in conservation practice, novel methods of treatment, preventive conservation, issues of collection care, conservation history and ethics, examination methods for works of art, new research in the analysis of artistic materials or mechanisms of deterioration, and conservation issues in display and storage.\n\nPublished annually from 2000 until 2010, \"Reviews in Conservation\" has now been incorporated into \"Studies in Conservation\".\n\n\"News in Conservation\" is published electronically every other month. It aims to provide a place where opinions, news, and information can be shared and discussed. Free to the general public for download from the IIC web-site, \"News in Conservation\" contains news from the IIC Council and regional groups, as well as job vacancies, conference listings, and notices, along with a mixture of news stories, features, interviews, and other articles relating to all aspects of conservation in every issue.\n\nIIC operates a lively Facebook page and Twitter and LinkedIn presence as well as a discussion group on LinkedIn. These allow for the rapid sharing of conservation news and events and, at LinkedIn, an active discussion forum for conservation issues and topics\n\nIn 1961, with the help of a grant from the Gulbenkian Foundation, the IIC held its first international conference. That meeting, in Rome, was attended by 150 people, and the papers were published by Butterworths under the title \"Recent Advances in Conservation\". Subsequently, conferences have been held at two- or three-year intervals with published preprints on a topic of current interest. Past conferences are:\nIn 2011 IIC instigated its Student & Emerging Conservator Conference series. These events are aimed at helping recent graduates and those still studying conservation to develop their skills and gain valuable career insights. They offer invaluable networking opportunities and panel discussions with webcasts, studio visits and a lively social programme.\n\nThe first conference in this series was\nThis was followed by:\nWith the next event planned for 2019.\n\nIIC's Regional Groups began in 1958. Regional Groups are independent associations affiliated or associated with IIC. A Regional Group is required to adhere to the aims and objectives of the IIC as expressed in the Memorandum of Association. Its by-laws must be approved by the IIC Council and its officers should be members of IIC. The first Regional Groups formed were the IIC-United Kingdom Group (now Icon, the Institute of Conservation) and the IIC-American Group (now the American Institute for Conservation). There are currently Regional Groups in Scandinavia, Austria, Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, and Spain as well as an Arabic Group.\n\nIIC Honorary Fellowship was established to recognise outstanding contributions to heritage conservation. The first Honorary Fellowship was awarded to Edward W. Forbes in 1958. Since that date the award has been made to the following individuals:\n\nThe Keck Award, endowed by Sheldon and Caroline Keck, is presented every two years at the IIC Congress to the individual or group who has, in the opinion of the Council, contributed most towards promoting public understanding and appreciation of the accomplishments of the conservation profession.\n\nPast winners of the Keck Award are:\nThe Forbes Prize Lecture has been delivered at every IIC Congress since the Rome Congress in 1961. In 1958 a Forbes Prize Fund had been set up at the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, to which financial contributions were made in recognition of Edward W. Forbes's services to conservation. The fund was to be administered by IIC to provide some kind of prize for outstanding work in the field of conservation. It was agreed in 1960 that the accumulated funds should be awarded in the form of a fee for a Forbes Lecture at the 1961 IIC Rome Conference, and the first Forbes Prize lecture was given there by Harold Plenderleith.\n\nPast Forbes Prize Lecturers:\nThe HP Image Permanence Award, sponsored by Hewlett-Packard and given with participation of IIC, was run until 2013 and recognised outstanding contributions that advance the longevity of photographic and fine art images created via modern digital methods. Past winners are:\n\n\nThe Gabo Trust - IIC Travelling Scholarship is a monetary award that allows individuals to travel around the world with the aim of carrying out research on the conservation of sculpture and meeting and seeing the work of other conservators and learning about their approaches, ethics, materials, and methods.\n\nThe Brommelle Memorial Fund was established in 1990 in memory of Norman Brommelle, who was Secretary-General of IIC between 1958 and 1988. The fund is used to provide assistance for students of conservation who wish to attend the Institute's international congresses.\n\nIIC supports conservation institutions and individual conservators who cannot afford the cost of membership through its Opportunities Fund. The fund is maintained through contributions of members and allows successful applicants to receive up to three years' membership of IIC without charge.\n\n"}
{"id": "22777913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22777913", "title": "Is God Dead?", "text": "Is God Dead?\n\n\"Is God Dead?\" was an April 8, 1966, cover story for the news magazine \"Time\". A previous article, from October 1965, had investigated a trend among 1960s theologians to write God out of the field of theology. The 1966 article looked in greater depth at the problems facing modern theologians, in making God relevant to an increasingly secular society. Modern science had eliminated the need for religion to explain the natural world, and God took up less and less space in people's daily lives. The ideas of various scholars were brought in, including the application of contemporary philosophy to the field of theology, and a more personal, individual approach to religion.\n\nThe issue drew heavy criticism, both from the broader public and from clergymen. Much of the criticism was directed at the provocative magazine cover, rather than the content of the article. The coverall black with the words \"Is God Dead?\" in large red textmarked the first time in the magazine's history that text with no accompanying image was used. In 2008, the \"Los Angeles Times\" named the \"Is God Dead?\" issue among \"10 magazine covers that shook the world\".\n\nIn 1966, Otto Fuerbringer had been editor of the news magazine \"Time\" for six years. He helped to increase the circulation of the magazine, partly by changing its rather austere image. Though a conservative himself, he made the magazine focus extensively on the counter-culture and the political and intellectual radicalism of the 1960s. A best-selling 1964 issue, for instance, had dealt with the sexual revolution. Already in October 1965 the magazine had published an article on the new radical theological movement.\n\nThe April 8, 1966, cover of \"Time\" magazine was the first cover in the magazine's history to feature only type, and no photo. The coverwith the traditional, red borderwas all black, with the words \"Is God Dead?\" in large, red text. The question was a reference to Friedrich Nietzsche's much-quoted postulate \"God is dead\" (), which he first proposed in his 1882 book \"The Gay Science\".\n\nThe article accompanying the magazine cover, titled \"Toward a Hidden God\" and written by religion editor John T. Elson, mentioned the so-called \"God Is Dead\" movement only briefly in its introduction. In a footnote it identified the leaders of the movement as \"Thomas J. J. Altizer of Emory University, William Hamilton of Colgate Rochester Divinity School, and Paul van Buren of Temple University\", and explained how these theologians had been trying to construct a theology without God. This theme had already been dealt with in greater detail in the shorter and less prominent article \"The \"God Is Dead\" Movement\", on October 22, 1965.\nThe article pointed out that while this movement had roots in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, it also drew on a broader range of thinkers. For example, philosophers and theologians like Søren Kierkegaard and Dietrich Bonhoeffer expressed concerns about the role of God in an increasingly secularised world. The immediate reality did not indicate a death of God or religion; Pope John XXIII's Second Vatican Council had done much to revitalize the Roman Catholic Church, while in the United States, as many as 97% declared a belief in God. Evangelical ministers such as Billy Graham and Christian artists like the playwright William Alfred could be brought as witness to the continued vitality of the Christian church. Nevertheless, this religiosity was mostly skin-deep; only 27% of Americans called themselves deeply religious.\n\nThe article then went on to explain the history of monotheism, culminating in the omnipresent Catholic church of the European Middle Ages. This zenith, however, was, according to the article, the beginning of the demise of Christianity: as society became increasingly secularised, the religious sphere of society became marginalised. Scientific discovery, from the Copernican Revolution to Darwin's theory of evolution, eliminated much of the need for religious explanations to life. Newton and Descartes were perhaps personally devout men, but their discoveries \"explained much of nature that previously seemed godly mysteries.\"\n\nHaving laid out the philosophical and historical background, the article then asserted that there was still much curiosity among the general population about God and His relation to the world, and that for the modern theologian who wished to address this curiosity, there seemed to be four options:\nAccording to the article, some contemporary ministers and theologians chose to focus on the life and teachings of Jesus, rather than on God, since Christ was a figure with great appeal among the broader population, but this solution ran dangerously close to ethical humanism. Biblical literalism, on the other hand, might have had an appeal to the fervent believer, but did not speak to most people in a world where the language of the Bible was increasingly unfamiliar.\n\nThe article described other attempts that had been made to solve to the problems of religion, including the adaptation of contemporary philosophical terminology to explain God, and cited efforts made to adapt the writings of Martin Heidegger and Alfred North Whitehead to modern theology. At the same time it noted that Ian Ramsey of Oxford had spoken of so-called \"discernment situations\"; situations in life that led man to question his own existence and purpose, and turn towards a greater power. The article concluded that the current crisis of faith could be healthy for the church, and that it might force clergymen and theologians to abandon previously held certainties: \"The church might well need to take a position of reverent agnosticism regarding some doctrines that it had previously proclaimed with excessive conviction.\"\n\nThe publication of the article immediately led to a public backlash. Editorial pages of newspapers received numerous letters from angry readers, and clergymen vehemently protested the content of the article. Even though the article itself explored the theological and philosophical issues in depth, \"[m]any people...were too quick to judge the magazine by its cover and denounced \"Time\" as a haven of godlessness\". For \"Time\" the issue caused around 3,500 letters to the editorthe largest number of responses to any one story in the history of the magazine. Reader criticism was targeted at Thomas J. J. Altizer in particular. Altizer left Emory in 1968, and by the end of the decade the \"death of God\" movement had lost much of its momentum. In its issue of December 26, 1969, \"Time\" ran a follow-up cover story asking, \"Is God Coming Back to Life\"?\n\nThe magazine cover also entered the realm of popular culture: in a scene from the 1968 horror movie \"Rosemary's Baby\", the protagonist Rosemary Woodhouse picks up the issue in a doctor's waiting room. The \"Is God Dead?\" issue was to have an enduring place in American journalism. In 2008, the \"Los Angeles Times\" listed the issue in a featured titled \"10 magazine covers that shook the world\". In April 2009, \"Newsweek\" magazine ran a special report on the decline of religion in the United States under the title \"The End of Christian America\". This article also referenced the radical \"death of God\" theological movement of the mid-1960s. The front cover carried the title \"The Decline and Fall of Christian America\" in red letters on a black background, reminiscent of the 1966 \"Time\" cover. The April 3, 2017 cover of \"Time\" featured a cover that asked \"Is Truth Dead?\" in a similar style to the iconic \"Is God Dead?\" cover, in a cover story about the alleged falsehoods perpetuated by President Donald Trump.\n\n"}

He was educated at Sydney before enrolling at Trinity College, Toronto, in 1854. Although he was a good student, he left the university two years later and worked as a parliamentary reporter for a Toronto newspaper. In 1860, he was in Halifax, where he founded, together with Joseph C. Crosskill, his own newspaper, the \"Evening Reporter\". In May 1867, Bourinot left this newspaper and worked as a freelance writer for some time, until he secured a job as a clerk at the Senate of Canada in May 1869. In the following years, he steadily advanced through various grades until he was appointed chief clerk of the House of Commons of Canada in December 1880. a post he would occupy until his death 22 years later.\n\nA founding member of the Royal Society of Canada, he also acted as its honorary secretary, and in 1892 served as president of the society. He wrote many books political history, some of which were considered references for decades to come. His \"Parliamentary Procedure and Practice in Canada\" (Montréal, 1884) is considered a standard work, and was cited as recently as 24 October 2013 by the Speaker of the Senate, the Honourable Noel Kinsella. \"How Canada is governed\" (Toronto, 1895) was a widely used textbook, and \"Canada under British rule, 1760 – 1900\" (Cambridge, England, 1900) was also popular.

For films in which any portion of the footage remains (including trailers), see List of incomplete or partially lost films.\n\nFilms may go missing for a number of reasons. One major contributing factor is the common use of nitrate film until the early 1950s. This type of film is highly flammable, and there have been several devastating fires, such as the Universal Pictures fire in 1924, the 1937 Fox vault fire and the 1965 MGM vault fire.\n\nBlack-and-white film prints judged to be otherwise worthless were sometimes incinerated to salvage the meager scrap value of the silver image particles in their emulsions. Films have disappeared when production companies went bankrupt. Occasionally, a studio would remake a film and destroy the earlier version. Silent films in particular were once seen as having no further commercial value and were simply junked to clear out expensive storage space.\n\nThis is necessarily an incomplete list. Martin Scorsese's Film Foundation claims that \"half of all American films made before 1950 and over 90% of films made before 1929 are lost forever.\" Deutsche Kinemathek estimates that 80–90% of silent films are gone; the film archive's own list contains over 3500 lost films.\n\nA study by the Library of Congress states that 75% of all silent films are now lost.

He did this by rescuing the amazing work of gunmaker John Hall at the Harpers Ferry Armory from obscurity. During 1815-1834, Hall had pulled together all previous progress on industrial standardization and combined it with brilliant machine designs and effective team management to realize the long-desired goal of true parts interchangeability. Hall’s innovative breechloading US Rifle Model 1819 was the first product ever made in large numbers whose components could be freely exchanged with one another and still function. Earlier industrial historians had often credited Eli Whitney with perfecting standardized parts prior to Smith, but although Whitney did make some progress toward the goal, he ultimately gave up the effort. Smith’s research on Hall’s work at Harpers Ferry has put the Maine craftsman back in his proper position in the industrial pantheon. (David Hounshell, From the American System to Mass Production, 1800-1932, p. 29.) Hall’s manufacturing technique became known as the American System, and today it is universal. “Although recognized by his contemporaries as a major contributor to the American System,” wrote industrial historian David Hounshell in 1984, “John H. Hall escaped the attention of modern historians until recently. Merritt Roe Smith’s Harpers Ferry and the New Technology has provided an outstanding study of Hall’s achievements.” (Hounshell, American System, p. 39.)\n\n\n"}

The historic area was almost completely wiped out during the Allied bomb attack during the Second World War. After the war Dresden fell under Soviet occupation and later the communist German Democratic Republic who rebuilt the Neumarkt area in socialist realist style and partially with historic buildings. However huge areas and parcels of the place remained untilled. After the fall of Communism and German reunification the decision was made to restore the Neumarkt to its pre-war look.\n\nDue to its location on a slight rise above the flood-prone Elbe River, the Neumarkt was one of the first areas of Dresden's old city to be settled, with a small village arising around the old Frauenkirche. However, it was not actually located within the city walls until the city was expanded in 1530, from which point on, the old town contained two market squares. The square located around the Kreuzkirche was renamed \"Altmarkt\" (German for \"Old Market\"), and the square surrounding the Frauenkirche was named the \"Neumarkt\" (\"New Market\").\n\nDuring the reign of August II the Strong, a great number of structures in Dresden were built in Baroque style, including the present-day Frauenkirche, and numerous other houses surrounding the Neumarkt. After damage sustained to buildings through artillery fire in the Seven Years' War, a number of structures on the Neumarkt were rebuilt in the Rococo and late Baroque styles.\n\nDuring the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the Neumarkt remained largely unchanged, except for renovations to the Johanneum completed in 1873 and the construction of the Albertinum and Academy of Arts completed at the end of the 1800s.\n\nDuring the bomb attack on Dresden in February 1945, the area around the Neumarkt was almost entirely destroyed in the resulting firestorm. The main structure of the Frauenkirche survived the initial bombing and firestorm, before collapsing a few days later. During the 1950s and 60s under rule of the German Democratic Republic, the Neumarkt and Altmarkt formed a mostly vacant area through the middle of the old city, save for the ruins of the Frauenkirche standing as a memorial to the horrors of war. The two squares were separated by the widened Wilsdruffer Strasse, then from 1969 by the Palace of Culture, and then later by new apartment blocks.\n\nThe completion of the reconstructed Dresden Frauenkirche in 2005 marked the first step in rebuilding the Neumarkt. Organisations such as the Gesellschaft Historischer Neumarkt Dresden actively encourage an historically-faithful reconstruction of the structures around the Neumarkt, giving an outward appearance as close as possible to that from before 1945. \n\nThe areas around the square have been divided into 8 \"Quarters\", with each being rebuilt as a separate project, the majority of buildings to be rebuilt either to the original structure or at least with a facade similar to the original.\n\nQuarter I and the front section of Quarters II, III, IV and V(II) have since been completed, with Quarter VIII currently under construction.\n\nThe reconstruction of the structures surrounding the Neumarkt has created some controversy, with architecture critic Andreas Ruby criticising the attempt to reconstruct the historic character of the city as inauthentic, likening it to the recreation of Venice to be found at the Venetian Resort Hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nThere has also been extensive debate as to what extent contemporary architecture should be present on the rebuilt Neumarkt.\n\n"}

{"id": "462477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=462477", "title": "Persian literature", "text": "Persian literature\n\nPersian literature (, \"Adabiyât-i fârsi\") comprises oral compositions and written texts in the Persian language and it is one of the world's oldest literatures. It spans over two-and-a-half millennia. Its sources have been within Greater Iran including present-day Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Caucasus, and Turkey, regions of Central Asia (such as Tajikistan) and South Asia where the Persian language has historically been either the native or official language. For instance, Rumi, one of best-loved Persian poets born in Balkh (in what is now the modern-day Afghanistan) or Vakhsh (in what is now the modern-day Tajikistan), wrote in Persian and lived in Konya, then the capital of the Seljuks in Anatolia. The Ghaznavids conquered large territories in Central and South Asia and adopted Persian as their court language. There is thus Persian literature from Iran, Mesopotamia, Azerbaijan, the wider Caucasus, Turkey, western parts of Pakistan, India, Tajikistan and other parts of Central Asia. Not all Persian literature is written in Persian, as some consider works written by ethnic Persians in other languages, such as Greek and Arabic, to be included. At the same time, not all literature written in Persian is written by ethnic Persians or Iranians, as Turkic, Caucasian, and Indic poets and writers have also used the Persian language in the environment of Persianate cultures.\n\nDescribed as one of the great literatures of humanity, including Goethe's assessment of it as one of the four main bodies of world literature, Persian literature has its roots in surviving works of Middle Persian and Old Persian, the latter of which date back as far as 522 BCE, the date of the earliest surviving Achaemenid inscription, the Behistun Inscription. The bulk of surviving Persian literature, however, comes from the times following the Arab conquest of Persia c. 650 CE. After the Abbasids came to power (750 CE), the Iranians became the scribes and bureaucrats of the Arab empire and, increasingly, also its writers and poets. The New Persian language literature arose and flourished in Khorasan and Transoxiana because of political reasons, early Iranian dynasties such as the Tahirids and Samanids being based in Khorasan.\n\nPersian poets such as Ferdowsi, Sa'di, Hafiz, Attar, Nezami, Rumi and Omar Khayyam are also known in the West and have influenced the literature of many countries.\n\nVery few literary works of Achaemenid Iran have survived, due partly to the destruction of the library at Persepolis. Most of what remains consists of the royal inscriptions of Achaemenid kings, particularly Darius I (522–486 BC) and his son Xerxes. Many Zoroastrian writings were destroyed in the Islamic conquest of Iran in the 7th century. The Parsis who fled to India, however, took with them some of the books of the Zoroastrian canon, including some of the Avesta and ancient commentaries (\"Zend\") thereof. Some works of Sassanid geography and travel also survived, albeit in Arabic translations.\n\nNo single text devoted to literary criticism has survived from Pre-Islamic Iran. However, some essays in Pahlavi, such as \"Ayin-e name nebeshtan\" (Principles of Writing Book) and \"Bab-e edteda’I-ye\" (Kalileh o Demneh), have been considered as literary criticism (Zarrinkoub, 1959).\n\nSome researchers have quoted the \"Sho'ubiyye\" as asserting that the Pre-Islamic Iranians had books on eloquence, such as 'Karvand'. No trace remains of such books. There are some indications that some among the Persian elite were familiar with Greek rhetoric and literary criticism (Zarrinkoub, 1947).\n\nWhile initially overshadowed by Arabic during the Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphates, New Persian soon became a literary language again of the Central Asian and West Asian lands. The rebirth of the language in its new form is often accredited to Ferdowsi, Unsuri, Daqiqi, Rudaki, and their generation, as they used Pre-Islamic nationalism as a conduit to revive the language and customs of ancient Iran.\n\nSo strong is the Persian inclination to versifying everyday expressions that one can encounter poetry in almost every classical work, whether from Persian literature, science, or metaphysics. In short, the ability to write in verse form was a pre-requisite for any scholar. For example, almost half of Avicenna's medical writings are in verse.\n\nWorks of the early era of Persian poetry are characterized by strong court patronage, an extravagance of panegyrics, and what is known as سبک فاخر \"exalted in style\". The tradition of royal patronage began perhaps under the Sassanid era and carried over through the Abbasid and Samanid courts into every major Iranian dynasty. The Qasida was perhaps the most famous form of panegyric used, though quatrains such as those in Omar Khayyam's Ruba'iyyat are also widely popular.\n\nKhorasani style, whose followers mostly were associated with Greater Khorasan, is characterized by its supercilious diction, dignified tone, and relatively literate language. The chief representatives of this lyricism are Asjadi, Farrukhi Sistani, Unsuri, and Manuchehri. Panegyric masters such as Rudaki were known for their love of nature, their verse abounding with evocative descriptions.\n\nThrough these courts and system of patronage emerged the epic style of poetry, with Ferdowsi's \"Shahnama\" at the apex. By glorifying the Iranian historical past in heroic and elevated verses, he and other notables such as Daqiqi and Asadi Tusi presented the \"Ajam\" with a source of pride and inspiration that has helped preserve a sense of identity for the Iranian People over the ages. Ferdowsi set a model to be followed by a host of other poets later on.\n\nThe 13th century marks the ascendancy of lyric poetry with the consequent development of the ghazal into a major verse form, as well as the rise of mystical and Sufi poetry. This style is often called Araqi (Iraqi) style, (western provinces of Iran were known as The Persian Iraq (Araq-e-Ajam) and is known by its emotional lyric qualities, rich meters, and the relative simplicity of its language. Emotional romantic poetry was not something new however, as works such as Vis o Ramin by As'ad Gorgani, and \"Yusof o Zoleikha\" by Am'aq Bokharai exemplify. Poets such as Sana'i and Attar (who ostensibly have inspired Rumi), Khaqani Shirvani, Anvari, and Nizami, were highly respected ghazal writers. However, the elite of this school are Rumi, Sadi, and Hafiz Shirazi.\n\nRegarding the tradition of Persian love poetry during the Safavid era, Persian historian Ehsan Yarshater notes, \"As a rule, the beloved is not a woman, but a young man. In the early centuries of Islam, the raids into Central Asia produced many young slaves. Slaves were also bought or received as gifts. They were made to serve as pages at court or in the households of the affluent, or as soldiers and bodyguards. Young men, slaves or not, also, served wine at banquets and receptions, and the more gifted among them could play music and maintain a cultivated conversation. It was love toward young pages, soldiers, or novices in trades and professions which was the subject of lyrical introductions to panegyrics from the beginning of Persian poetry, and of the ghazal. \"\nDuring the same Safavid era, many subjects of the Iranian Safavids were patrons of Persian poetry, such as Teimuraz I of Kakheti.\n\nIn the didactic genre one can mention Sanai's \"Hadiqat-ul-Haqiqah\" (Garden of Truth) as well as Nizami's \"Makhzan-ul-Asrār\" (Treasury of Secrets). Some of Attar's works also belong to this genre as do the major works of Rumi, although some tend to classify these in the lyrical type due to their mystical and emotional qualities. In addition, some tend to group Naser Khosrow's works in this style as well; however true gems of this genre are two books by Sadi, a heavyweight of Persian literature, the \"Bustan\" and the \"Gulistan\".\n\nAfter the 15th century, the Indian style of Persian poetry (sometimes also called \"Isfahani\" or \"Safavi\" styles) took over. This style has its roots in the Timurid era and produced the likes of Amir Khosrow Dehlavi, and Bhai Nand Lal Goya.\n\nThe most significant prose writings of this era are Nizami Arudhi Samarqandi's \"Chahār Maqāleh\" as well as Zahiriddin Nasr Muhammad Aufi's anecdote compendium \"Jawami ul-Hikayat\".\nShams al-Mo'ali Abol-hasan Ghaboos ibn Wushmgir's famous work, the \"Qabus nama\" (\"A Mirror for Princes\"), is a highly esteemed Belles-lettres work of Persian literature. Also highly regarded is \"Siyasatnama\", by Nizam al-Mulk, a famous Persian vizier. \"Kelileh va Demneh\", translated from Indian folk tales, can also be mentioned in this category. It is seen as a collection of adages in Persian literary studies and thus does not convey folkloric notions.\n\nAmong the major historical and biographical works in classical Persian, one can mention Abolfazl Beyhaghi's famous \"Tarikh-i Beyhaqi\", \"Lubab ul-Albab\" of Zahiriddin Nasr Muhammad Aufi (which has been regarded as a reliable chronological source by many experts), as well as Ata-Malik Juvayni's famous \"Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i Juvaini\" (which spans the Mongolid and Ilkhanid era of Iran). Attar's \"Tazkerat-ol-Owliya\" (\"Biographies of the Saints\") is also a detailed account of Sufi mystics, which is referenced by many subsequent authors and considered a significant work in mystical hagiography.\n\nThe oldest surviving work of Persian literary criticism after the Islamic conquest of Persia is \"Muqaddame-ye Shahname-ye Abu Mansuri\", which was written during the Samanid period. The work deals with the myths and legends of Shahname and is considered the oldest surviving example of Persian prose. It also shows an attempt by the authors to evaluate literary works critically.\n\n\"One Thousand and One Nights\" () is a medieval folk tale collection which tells the story of Scheherazade ( \"Šahrzād\"), a Sassanid queen who must relate a series of stories to her malevolent husband, King Shahryar ( \"Šahryār\"), to delay her execution. The stories are told over a period of one thousand and one nights, and every night she ends the story with a suspenseful situation, forcing the King to keep her alive for another day. The individual stories were created over several centuries, by many people from a number of different lands.\n\nThe nucleus of the collection is formed by a Pahlavi Sassanid Persian book called \"Hazār Afsānah\" (, \"Thousand Myths\"), a collection of ancient Indian and Persian folk tales.\n\nDuring the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the 8th century, Baghdad had become an important cosmopolitan city. Merchants from Persia, China, India, Africa, and Europe were all found in Baghdad. During this time, many of the stories that were originally folk stories are thought to have been collected orally over many years and later compiled into a single book. The compiler and 9th-century translator into Arabic is reputedly the storyteller \"Abu Abd-Allah Muhammad el-Gahshigar\". The frame story of Shahrzad seems to have been added in the 14th century.\n\nThe biggest Persian dictionary is \"Dehkhoda Dictionary\" (16 volumes) by\nAli-Akbar Dehkhoda. It is the largest comprehensive Persian dictionary ever published, comprising 16 volumes (more than 27000 pages). It is published by the Tehran University Press (UTP) under the supervision of the Dehkhoda Dictionary Institute. It traces the historical development of the Persian language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world.\nHe names 200 Persian lexicographical works in his dictionary, the earliest, \"Farhang-i Oim\" () and \"Farhang-i Menakhtay\" (), from the late Sassanid era.\n\nThe most widely used Persian lexicons in the Middle Ages were those of Abu Hafs Soghdi () and Asadi Tusi (), written in 1092.\n\nAlso highly regarded in the contemporary Persian literature lexical corpus are the works of Dr. Mohammad Moin. The first volume of Moin Dictionary was published in 1963.\n\nIn 1645, Christian Ravius completed a Persian-Latin dictionary, printed at Leiden. This was followed by J. Richardson's two-volume Oxford edition (1777) and Gladwin-Malda's (1770) Persian-English Dictionaries, Scharif and S. Peters' Persian-Russian Dictionary (1869), and 30 other Persian lexicographical translations through the 1950s.\n\nCurrently English-Persian dictionaries of Manouchehr Aryanpour and Soleiman Haim are widely used in Iran.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare referred to Iran as the \"land of the Sophy\". Some of Persia's best-beloved medieval poets were Sufis, and their poetry was, and is, widely read by Sufis from Morocco to Indonesia. Rumi (Maulānā ), in particular is renowned both as a poet and as the founder of a widespread Sufi order. The themes and styles of this devotional poetry have been widely imitated by many Sufi poets. See also the article on Sufi poetry.\n\nMany notable texts in Persian mystic literature are not poems, yet highly read and regarded. Among those are \"Kimiya-yi sa'ādat\", \"Asrar al-Tawhid\" and \"Kashf ul Mahjoob\".\n\nStarting from the early 16th century, Persian traditions had a large impact on Georgian ruling elites, which in turn resulted in Persian influence on Georgian art, architecture and literature. This cultural influence lasted until the arrival of the Russians.\n\nJamshid Sh. Giunashvili remarks on the connection of Georgian culture with that of the Persian literary work \"Shahnameh\":\n\nFarmanfarmaian in the \"Journal of Persianate Studies\":\n\nDespite that Asia Minor (or Anatolia) had been ruled various times prior to the Middle Ages by various Persian-speaking dynasties originating in Iran, the language lost its traditional foothold there with the demise of the Sassanian Empire. Centuries later however, the practise and usage in the region would be strongly revived. A branch of the Seljuks, the Sultanate of Rum, took Persian language, art and letters to Anatolia. They adopted Persian language as the official language of the empire. The Ottomans, which can \"roughly\" be seen as their eventual successors, took this tradition over. Persian was the official court language of the empire, and for some time, the official language of the empire. The educated and noble class of the Ottoman Empire all spoke Persian, such as sultan Selim I, despite being Safavid Iran's archrival and a staunch opposer of Shia Islam. It was a major literary language in the empire. Some of the noted earlier Persian literature works during the Ottoman rule are Idris Bidlisi's \"Hasht Bihisht\", which begun in 1502 and covered the reign of the first eight Ottoman rulers, and the \"Salim-Namah\", a glorification of Selim I. After a period of several centuries, Ottoman Turkish (which was highly Persianised itself) had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature, which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation. However, the number of Persian and Arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88%. The Ottomans produced thousands of Persian literary works throughout their century long lifespan.\n\nWith the emergence of the Ghaznavids and their successors such as the Ghurids, Timurids and Mughal Empire, Persian culture and its literature gradually moved into South Asia too. In general, from its earliest days, Persian literature and language was imported into the subcontinent by culturally Persianised Turkic and Afghan dynasties. Persian became the language of the nobility, literary circles, and the royal Mughal courts for hundreds of years. In the early 19th century, Hindustani replaced it.\n\nUnder the Moghul Empire of India during the 16th century, the official language of India became Persian. Only in 1832 did the British army force the South Asia to begin conducting business in English. Persian poetry in fact flourished in these regions while post-Safavid Iranian literature stagnated. Dehkhoda and other scholars of the 20th century, for example, largely based their works on the detailed lexicography produced in India, using compilations such as Ghazi khan Badr Muhammad Dehlavi's \"Adat al-Fudhala\" (), Ibrahim Ghavamuddin Farughi's \"Farhang-i Ibrahimi\" (), and particularly Muhammad Padshah's \"Farhang-i Anandraj\" ().\n\nPersian literature was little known in the West before the 18-19th century. It became much better known following the publication of several translations from the works of late medieval Persian poets, and it inspired works by various Western poets and writers.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most popular Persian poet of the 19th and early 20th centuries was Omar Khayyam (1048–1123), whose \"Rubaiyat\" was freely translated by Edward Fitzgerald in 1859. Khayyam is esteemed more as a scientist than a poet in his native Persia, but in Fitzgerald's rendering, he became one of the most quoted poets in English. Khayyam's line, \"A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and thou\", is known to many who could not say who wrote it, or where:\nThe Persian poet and mystic Rumi (1207–1273) (known as Molana in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan; and as Mevlana in Turkey), has attracted a large following in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Popularizing translations by Coleman Barks have presented Rumi as a New Age sage. There are also a number of more literary translations by scholars such as A. J. Arberry.\n\nThe classical poets (Hafiz, Sa'di, Khayyam, Rumi, Nizami and Ferdowsi) are now widely known in English and can be read in various translations. Other works of Persian literature are untranslated and little known.\n\nDuring the last century, numerous works of classical Persian literature have been translated into Swedish by baron Eric Hermelin. He translated works by, among others, Farid al-Din Attar, Rumi, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Sa'adi and Sana'i. Influenced by the writings of the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, he was especially attracted to the religious or Sufi aspects of classical Persian poetry. His translations have had a great impact on numerous modern Swedish writers, among them Karl Wennberg, Willy Kyrklund and Gunnar Ekelöf. More recently classical authors such as Hafez, Rumi, Araqi and Nizami Aruzi has been rendered into Swedish by the iranist Ashk Dahlén, who has published several essays on the development of Persian literature. Excerpts from Ferdousi's \"Shahnama\" has also been translated into Swedish prose by Namdar Nasser and Anja Malmberg.\n\nDuring the last century, numerous works of classical Persian literature have been translated into Italian by Alessandro Bausani (Nizami, Rumi, Iqbal, Khayyam), Carlo Saccone ('Attar, Sana'i, Hafiz, Nasir-i Khusraw, Nizami, Ahmad Ghazali, Ansari of Herat), Angelo Piemontese (Amir Khusraw Dihlavi), Pio Filippani-Ronconi (Nasir-i Khusraw, Sa'di), Riccardo Zipoli (Kay Ka'us, Bidil), Maurizio Pistoso (Nizam al-Mulk), Giorgio Vercellin (Nizami 'Aruzi), Giovanni Maria D'Erme ('Ubayd Zakani, Hafiz), Sergio Foti (Suhrawardi, Rumi, Jami), Rita Bargigli (Sa'di, Farrukhi, Manuchehri, 'Unsuri), Nahid Norozi (Sohrab Sepehri, Khwaju of Kerman, Ahmad Shamlu), Faezeh Mardani (Forugh Farrokhzad, Abbas Kiarostami). A complete translation of Firdawsi's \"Shah-nama\" was made by Italo Pizzi in the 19th century.\n\nIn the 19th century, Persian literature experienced dramatic change and entered a new era. The beginning of this change was exemplified by an incident in the mid-19th century at the court of Nasereddin Shah, when the reform-minded prime minister, Amir Kabir, chastised the poet Habibollah Qa'ani for \"lying\" in a panegyric qasida written in Kabir's honor. Kabir saw poetry in general and the type of poetry that had developed during the Qajar period as detrimental to \"progress\" and \"modernization\" in Iranian society, which he believed was in dire need of change. Such concerns were also expressed by others such as Fath-'Ali Akhundzadeh, Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani, and Mirza Malkom Khan. Khan also addressed a need for a change in Persian poetry in literary terms as well, always linking it to social concerns.\nThe new Persian literary movement cannot be understood without an understanding of the intellectual movements among Iranian philosophical circles. Given the social and political climate of Persia (Iran) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which led to the Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906–1911, the idea that change in poetry was necessary became widespread. Many argued that Persian poetry should reflect the realities of a country in transition. This idea was propagated by notable literary figures such as Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda and Abolqasem Aref, who challenged the traditional system of Persian poetry in terms of introducing new content and experimentation with rhetoric, lexico-semantics, and structure. Dehkhoda, for instance, used a lesser-known traditional form, the mosammat, to elegize the execution of a revolutionary journalist. 'Aref employed the ghazal, \"the most central genre within the lyrical tradition\" (p.  88), to write his \"Payam-e Azadi\" (Message of Freedom).\n\nSome researchers argue that the notion of \"sociopolitical ramifications of esthaetic changes\" led to the idea of poets \"as social leaders trying the limits and possibilities of social change\".\n\nAn important movement in modern Persian literature centered on the question of modernization and Westernization and whether these terms are synonymous when describing the evolution of Iranian society. It can be argued that almost all advocates of modernism in Persian literature, from Akhundzadeh, Kermani, and Malkom Khan to Dehkhoda, Aref, Bahar, and Taqi Rafat, were inspired by developments and changes that had occurred in Western, particularly European, literatures. Such inspirations did not mean blindly copying Western models but, rather, adapting aspects of Western literature and changing them to fit the needs of Iranian culture.\n\nFollowing the pioneering works of Ahmad Kasravi, Sadeq Hedayat, Moshfeq Kazemi and many others, the Iranian wave of comparative literature and literary criticism reached a symbolic crest with the emergence of Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub, Shahrokh Meskoob, Houshang Golshiri and Ebrahim Golestan.\n\nPersian literature in Afghanistan has also experienced a dramatic change during the last century. At the beginning of the 20th century, Afghanistan was confronted with economic and social change, which sparked a new approach to literature. In 1911, Mahmud Tarzi, who came back to Afghanistan after years of exile in Turkey and was influential in government circles, started a fortnightly publication named \"Saraj’ul Akhbar\". \"Saraj\" was not the first such publication in the country, but in the field of journalism and literature it launched a new period of change and modernization. \"Saraj\" not only played an important role in journalism, it also gave new life to literature as a whole and opened the way for poetry to explore new avenues of expression through which personal thoughts took on a more social colour.\n\nIn 1930 (1309 AH), after months of cultural stagnation, a group of writers founded the Herat Literary Circle. A year later, another group calling itself the Kabul Literary Circle was founded in the capital. Both groups published regular magazines dedicated to culture and Persian literature. Both, especially the Kabul publication, had little success in becoming venues for modern Persian poetry and writing. In time, the Kabul publication turned into a stronghold for traditional writers and poets, and modernism in Dari literature was pushed to the fringes of social and cultural life.\n\nThree of the most prominent classical poets in Afghanistan at the time were Qari Abdullah, Abdul Haq Betab and Khalil Ullah Khalili. The first two received the honorary title \"Malek ul Shoara\" (King of Poets). Khalili, the third and youngest, was drawn toward the \"Khorasan style\" of poetry instead of the usual \"Hendi style\". He was also interested in modern poetry and wrote a few poems in a more modern style with new aspects of thought and meaning. In 1318 (AH), after two poems by Nima Youshij titled \"Gharab\" and \"Ghoghnus\" were published, Khalili wrote a poem under the name \"Sorude Kuhestan\" or \"The Song of the Mountain\" in the same rhyming pattern as Nima and sent it to the Kabul Literary Circle. The traditionalists in Kabul refused to publish it because it was not written in the traditional rhyme. They criticized Khalili for modernizing his style.\n\nVery gradually new styles found their way into literature and literary circles despite the efforts of traditionalists. The first book of new poems was published in the year 1957 (1336 AH), and in 1962 (1341 AH), a collection of modern Persian (Dari) poetry was published in Kabul. The first group to write poems in the new style consisted of Mahmud Farani, Baregh Shafi’i, Solayman Layeq, Sohail, Ayeneh and a few others. Later, Vasef Bakhtari, Asadullah Habib and Latif Nazemi, and others joined the group. Each had his own share in modernizing Persian poetry in Afghanistan. Other notable figures include Leila Sarahat Roshani, Sayed Elan Bahar and Parwin Pazwak. Poets like Mayakovsky, Yase Nien and Lahouti (an Iranian poet living in exile in Russia) exerted a special influence on the Persian poets in Afghanistan. The influence of Iranians (e.g. Farrokhi Yazdi and Ahmad Shamlou) on the newly established Afghan prose and poetry, especially in the second half of the 20th century, must also be taken into consideration.\n\nProminent writers from Afghanistan like Asef Soltanzadeh, Reza Ebrahimi, Ameneh Mohammadi, and Abbas Jafari grew up in Iran and were influenced by Iranian writers and teachers.\n\nThe new poetry in Tajikistan is mostly concerned with the way of life of people and is revolutionary. From the 1950s until the advent of new poetry in France, Asia and Latin America, the impact of the modernization drive was strong. In the 1960s, modern Iranian poetry and that of Mohammad Iqbal Lahouri made a profound impression in Tajik poetry. This period is probably the richest and most prolific period for the development of themes and forms in Persian poetry in Tajikistan. Some Tajik poets were mere imitators, and one can easily see the traits of foreign poets in their work. Only two or three poets were able to digest the foreign poetry and compose original poetry. In Tajikistan, the format and pictorial aspects of short stories and novels were taken from Russian and other European literature. Some of Tajikistan's prominent names in Persian literature are Golrokhsar Safi Eva, Mo'men Ghena'at, Farzaneh Khojandi and Layeq Shir-Ali.\n\nAmong the best-known playwrights are:\n\nWell-known novelists include:\n\n\n\nPioneers of Persian literary criticism in 19th century include Mirza Fath `Ali Akhundzade, Mirza Malkom Khan, Mirza `Abd al-Rahim Talebof and Zeyn al-`Abedin Maraghe`i.\n\nProminent 20th century critics include:\n\n\nSaeed Nafisi analyzed and edited several critical works. He is well known for his works on Rudaki and Sufi literature. Parviz Natel-Khanlari and Gholamhossein Yousefi, who belong to Nafisi's generation, were also involved in modern literature and critical writings. Natel-Khanlari is distinguished by the simplicity of his style. He did not follow the traditionalists, nor did he advocate the new. Instead, his approach accommodated the entire spectrum of creativity and expression in Persian literature. Another critic, Ahmad Kasravi, an experienced authority on literature, attacked the writers and poets whose works served despotism.\n\nContemporary Persian literary criticism reached its maturity after Sadeq Hedayat, Ebrahim Golestan, Houshang Golshiri, Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub and Shahrokh Meskoob. Among these figures, Zarrinkoub held academic positions and had a reputation not only among the intelligentsia but also in academia. Besides his significant contribution to the maturity of Persian language and literature, Zarrinkoub boosted comparative literature and Persian literary criticism. Zarrinkoub's \"Serr e Ney\" is a critical and comparative analysis of Rumi's Masnavi. In turn, Shahrokh Meskoob worked on Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh, using the principles of modern literary criticism.\n\nMohammad Taghi Bahar's main contribution to this field is his book called \"Sabk Shenasi\" (Stylistics). It is a pioneering work on the practice of Persian literary historiography and the emergence and development of Persian literature as a distinct institution in the early part of the 20th century. It contends that the exemplary status of Sabk-shinasi rests on the recognition of its disciplinary or institutional achievements. It further contends that, rather than a text on Persian ‘stylistics’, Sabk-shinasi is a vast history of Persian literary prose, and, as such, is a significant intervention in Persian literary historiography.\n\nJalal Homaei, Badiozzaman Forouzanfar and his student, Mohammad Reza Shafiei-Kadkani, are other notable figures who have edited a number of prominent literary works.\n\nCritical analysis of Jami's works has been carried out by Ala Khan Afsahzad. His classic book won the prestigious award of Iran's Year Best book in the year 2000.\n\nHistorically, the modern Persian short story has undergone three stages of development: a formative period, a period of consolidation and growth, and a period of diversity.\n\nIn this period, the influence of the western literature on the Iranian writers and authors is obvious. The new and modern approaches to writing is introduced and several genres have developed specially in the field of short story. The most popular trends are toward post-modern methods and speculative fiction.\n\nNotable Persian poets, modern and classical, include Mehdi Akhavan-Sales, Simin Behbahani, Forough Farrokhzad, Mohammad Zohari, Bijan Jalali, Mina Assadi, Siavash Kasraie, Fereydoon Moshiri, Nader Naderpour, Sohrab Sepehri, Mohammad-Reza Shafiei-Kadkani, Ahmad Shamlou, Nima Yushij, Houshang Ebtehaj, Mirzadeh Eshghi (classical), Mohammad Taghi Bahar (classical), Aref Ghazvini (classical), Parvin Etesami (classical), and Shahriar (classical).\n\nA few notable classical poets have arisen since the 19th century, among whom Mohammad Taghi Bahar and Parvin Etesami have been most celebrated. Mohammad Taghi Bahar had the title \"king of poets\" and had a significant role in the emergence and development of Persian literature as a distinct institution in the early part of the 20th century. The theme of his poems was the social and political situation of Iran.\n\nParvin Etesami may be called the greatest Persian woman poet writing in the classical style. One of her remarkable series, called \"Mast va Hoshyar\" (The Drunk and the Sober), won admiration from many of those involved in romantic poetry.\n\nNima Yushij is considered the father of modern Persian poetry, introducing many techniques and forms to differentiate the modern from the old. Nevertheless, the credit for popularizing this new literary form within a country and culture solidly based on a thousand years of classical poetry goes to his few disciples such as Ahmad Shamlou, who adopted Nima's methods and tried new techniques of modern poetry.\n\nThe transformation brought about by Nima Youshij, who freed Persian poetry from the fetters of prosodic measures, was a turning point in a long literary tradition. It broadened the perception and thinking of the poets that came after him. Nima offered a different understanding of the principles of classical poetry. His artistry was not confined to removing the need for a fixed-length hemistich and dispensing with the tradition of rhyming but focused on a broader structure and function based on a contemporary understanding of human and social existence. His aim in renovating poetry was to commit it to a \"natural identity\" and to achieve a modern discipline in the mind and linguistic performance of the poet.\n\nNima held that the formal technique dominating classical poetry interfered with its vitality, vigor and progress. Although he accepted some of its aesthetic properties and extended them in his poetry, he never ceased to widen his poetic experience by emphasizing the \"natural order\" of this art. What Nima Youshij founded in contemporary poetry, his successor Ahmad Shamlou continued.\n\nThe Sepid poem (which translates to white poem), which draws its sources from this poet, avoided the compulsory rules which had entered the Nimai’ school of poetry and adopted a freer structure. This allowed a more direct relationship between the poet and his or her emotional roots. In previous poetry, the qualities of the poet’s vision as well as the span of the subject could only be expressed in general terms and were subsumed by the formal limitations imposed on poetic expression.\n\nNima’s poetry transgressed these limitations. It relied on the natural function inherent within poetry itself to portray the poet’s solidarity with life and the wide world surrounding him or her in specific and unambiguous details and scenes. Sepid poetry continues the poetic vision as Nima expressed it and avoids the contrived rules imposed on its creation. However, its most distinct difference with Nimai’ poetry is to move away from the rhythms it employed. Nima Youshij paid attention to an overall harmonious rhyming and created many experimental examples to achieve this end.\n\nAhmad Shamlu discovered the inner characteristics of poetry and its manifestation in the literary creations of classical masters as well as the Nimai’ experience. He offered an individual approach. By distancing himself from the obligations imposed by older poetry and some of the limitations that had entered the Nimai’ poem, he recognized the role of prose and music hidden in the language. In the structure of Sepid poetry, in contrast to the prosodic and Nimai’ rules, the poem is written in more \"natural\" words and incorporates a prose-like process without losing its poetic distinction.\nSepid poetry is a developing branch of Nimai’ poetry built upon Nima Youshij's innovations. Nima thought that any change in the construction and the tools of a poet’s expression is conditional on his/her knowledge of the world and a revolutionized outlook. Sepid poetry could not take root outside this teaching and its application.\n\nAccording to Simin Behbahani, Sepid poetry did not receive general acceptance before Bijan Jalali's works. He is considered the founder of Sepid poetry according to Behbahani.\nBehbahani herself used the \"Char Pareh\" style of Nima, and subsequently turned to ghazal, a free-flowing poetry style similar to the Western sonnet. Simin Behbahani contributed to a historic development in the form of the ghazal, as she added theatrical subjects, and daily events and conversations into her poetry. She has expanded the range of traditional Persian verse forms and produced some of the most significant works of Persian literature in the 20th century.\n\nA reluctant follower of Nima Yushij, Mehdi Akhavan-Sales published his \"Organ\" (1951) to support contentions against Nima Yushij's groundbreaking endeavors. In Persian poetry, Mehdi Akhavan Sales has established a bridge between the \"Khorassani\" and \"Nima\" Schools. The critics consider Mehdi Akhavan Sales as one of the best contemporary Persian poets. He is one of the pioneers of free verse (new style poetry) in Persian literature, particularly of modern style epics. It was his ambition, for a long time, to introduce a fresh style to Persian poetry.\n\nForough Farrokhzad is important in the literary history of Iran for three reasons. First, she was among the first generation to embrace the new style of poetry, pioneered by Nima Yushij during the 1920s, which demanded that poets experiment with rhyme, imagery, and the individual voice. Second, she was the first modern Iranian woman to graphically articulate private sexual landscapes from a woman's perspective. Finally, she transcended her own literary role and experimented with acting, painting, and documentary film-making.\n\nFereydoon Moshiri is best known as conciliator of classical Persian poetry with the New Poetry initiated by Nima Yooshij. One of the major contributions of Moshiri's poetry, according to some observers, is the broadening of the social and geographical scope of modern Persian literature.\n\nA poet of the last generation before the Islamic Revolution worthy of mention is Mohammad-Reza Shafiei-Kadkani (M. Sereshk). Though he is from Khorassan and sways between allegiance to Nima Youshij and Akhavan Saless, in his poetry he shows the influences of Hafiz and Mowlavi. He uses simple, lyrical language and is mostly inspired by the political atmosphere. He is the most successful of those poets who in the past four decades have tried hard to find a synthesis between the two models of Ahmad Shamloo and Nima Youshij.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, a new generation of Iranian poets continues to work in the New Poetry style and now attracts an international audience thanks to efforts to translate their works. Éditions Bruno Doucey published a selection of forty-eight poems by Garus Abdolmalekian entitled \"Our Fists under the Table\" (2012), translated into French by Farideh Rava. Other notable names are poet and publisher Babak Abazari (1984–2015), who died under mysterious circumstances in January 2015, and emerging young poet Milad Khanmirzaei.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the late 17th century, during his search for a corrosion-resistant coating for iron, he developed a recipe that included asphaltum, linseed oil and burnt umber. Once applied to metal and heated the coating turned black and was extremely tough and durable.\n\nPontypool is in a steep valley in South Wales, surrounded by coal and iron working. The iron used was produced by the furnaces of Blaenavon to the North, and most of the \"Pontypool ware\" was actually produced in nearby Usk or Newport, at the Southern end of the valley.\n\nIn the late 17th century, there was a developing trade in metal goods made of thin iron sheet, spurred by development of the rolling mill. Rustproofing this iron was important. Tin plating had been developed in Germany, and British manufacturers needed to compete.\n\nWhile it was the growth of the iron foundries and tin plating that gave birth to japanning on metal, tin plated iron was not the only metal used. There are examples of brass, copper and bronze used as substrates. In France copper was the metal primarily used. Because it had to be hammered into shape rather than rolled and stamped the surface was uneven. This did not provide the best surface for japanning thus it has a greater tendency to flake off than the smoother English tinware. When the French made tinware it was often trimmed with bronze.\n\nThe use of metal allowed a variety of forms that were required to withstand heat and water. Coffee pots, tea sets, candle sticks and other household items could all be japanned and decorated in the popular fashion.\n\nThese japanned metal objects are very stable so a great many still survive. Many pieces survive today with little rust. In most cases it is easy to ascertain the underlying metal because it can be seen in losses or scratches. If the japanning is intact, a magnet can be used to identify iron. Most iron trays show some rust on the back where only a single coating was applied. Even the tin plated iron objects show rust in some areas.\n\nIt is worth remembering the unavailability of effective paint, at this time. The surface finishes that did exist either had poor adhesion to their substrate, or required either a porous or an organic substrate to bond to. Today's resin-based paints for metals had not been invented.\n\nSimilar recipes or \"secret varnishes\" were also used in Birmingham. In his book on Pontypool japan (W. D. John, 1953), published one of the recipes the workmen had handed down through generations:\n\nThe linseed oil was heated together with the umber and the asphaltum while the litharge and cobalt were added slowly. According to the recipe, the varnish was ready when a drop of varnish dripped onto cold glass remained in a ball. After cooling, the turpentine was added. There was also a pale clear version which omitted the asphaltum and the cobalt. In modern tests, this varnish worked equally well on papier mâché and metal plates. Three coats produced a durable glossy black finish.\n\nThis recipe is similar to one for gold size published by both (Robert Dossie, 1764) and (Stalker and Parker, 1688). In that version, linseed oil is boiled together with gum animi, asphaltum, litharge and umber in approximately the same proportions as the Pontypool recipe. (Watin, 1755) also describes the use of asphaltum as an addition to the well-known spirit varnishes of the day. It appears that the secret recipe for Pontypool japan had been in existence for some time before its use for japanning metal.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57441127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57441127", "title": "Save Venice Inc.", "text": "Save Venice Inc.\n\nSave Venice Inc. (SV) is a U.S. non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of art and architecture and the preservation of cultural heritage sites in Venice, Italy. Headquartered in New York City, it has an office in Venice, an active chapter in Boston, and supporters across the United States and Europe.\n\nSave Venice Inc. organizes special events, including annual masquerade balls, educational trips and lectures, and biennial galas in Venice, to raise funds and awareness for the preservation of Venetian art and architecture. Since its founding in December 1971, SV has restored more than 450 works of art and architecture in Venice. \n\nSave Venice Inc. was established in the wake of the catastrophic flooding in Italy in November 1966, which particularly damaged Florence Florence and also Venice Venice. The immediate response was the Committee to Rescue Italian Art (CRIA), which brought together donors, art historians, art conservators, and others to conserve damaged and imperiled works of art, architecture, books and manuscripts. Although CRIA’s work was accomplished quickly, closing its New York office in 1971 and its Florentine office in 1973, the organization’s success had drawn the world’s attention to the fragility of Italian artistic treasures and encouraged many others to take up the cause. \nRecognizing the devastation in Venice, Col. James A. Gray of the International Fund for Monuments (IFM) (now the World Monuments Fund) enlisted Professor John McAndrew of Wellesley College to coordinate administrative and academic assistance. In February 1969, the Venice Committee of the IFM began writing letters, organizing events, and raising money for Venice. By April, they had raised almost half a million dollars in cash, pledges, and donated art, and had founded chapters in Boston and California.\n\nIn December 1971, the organization changed its name and separated from the IFM to focus uniquely on the city of Venice. The founding members of SV were John McAndrew (1904-1978), Professor of Art History at Wellesley College; his wife, Betty Bartlett McAndrew (1906-1986); Sydney J. Freedberg (1914-1997), Chairman of the Department of Fine Art at Harvard University and later Chief Curator Emeritus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.; his wife Kathleen Wick; Eleanor Garvey (1918-2013), curator at Harvard’s Houghton Library; and lawyer Stuart Johnson. \n\nBeginning as a volunteer organization, Save Venice relied heavily upon the personal friendships of the McAndrews, as well as the historic connections between Venice and Boston. All mailings were hand-addressed by volunteers, gathered around a members’ dining table at home; fundraising efforts included sales of art, particularly paintings and works on paper, many taken from the walls of the McAndrews’ or their friends’ houses.\n\nRestoration projects ranged in scope and expense. Early conservation treatments could be as small as the repair of a damaged 15th-century map or as monumental as the restoration of Tintoretto’s huge \"Paradise\" in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio in the Palazzo Ducale (a canvas measuring 74 feet wide). Some altarpieces in churches and pictures in palaces had never been cleaned and were barely visible beneath layers of yellowed varnish, candle grease, and smoke. A related goal was to retain as much as possible of the original context of a work of art by keeping it in the place for which it was made, rather than transferring works to museums for safekeeping. Another major concern was to establish scientific laboratories for cleaning, restoration, and the instruction of these methods to new generations of conservators. As part of this, bursaries and scholarships were established for workmen, restorers, and scholars alike.\n\nMcAndrew, an architectural historian with a deep love for Venice, was the guiding spirit of Save Venice until his death in 1978. He was succeeded by Rollin van Nostrand (Bump) Hadley, the Director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. By the late 1980s, the heart of the organization had moved from Boston to New York, and a professional staff was hired. Laurence Lovett was elected President of Save Venice in 1986. Realizing that the needs of Venice far-eclipsed available money, he hired Beatrice Guthrie, who had been enormously successful in raising funds for the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Soon her husband, Dr. Randolph Guthrie, a prominent plastic surgeon, joined the Board as Treasurer and eventually succeeded Lovett as President. Together, the Guthries rapidly transformed Save Venice, increasing its annual fund-raising more than one hundred times. The increased ambition of Save Venice Inc. was most evident in its 1987 decision to restore the entire church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli necessitating a dramatic upturn in funds required. This led to the development of the first multiday galas in Venice, a long-weekend format with educational components, social events, and a black-tie benefit dinner that continues to take place every two years and that has been taken up by many other organizations. Through these galas in Venice, benefit dinners in New York and elsewhere, trips and cruises, corporate sponsors, commercial endorsements, bequests, and a membership program, Save Venice has raised in some years as much for Venice as the two dozen other private committees devoted to Venice combined.\n\nPresidents\n\n\nChairman of the Board\n\n\nExecutive Director\n\n\nDirector, Venice Office\n\n\nDirector, New York Office\n\n\nRestoration projects are selected once a year, after Board members gather in Venice to visit potential projects suggested by numerous parties — government agencies, museums, churches, academics, and friends. Decisions are made with guidance from the Project Committee, composed of a dozen art experts in the United States. Restorations are executed by trained conservators under the supervision of specialists in the Italian Superintendencies of Fine Arts and Monuments.\n\nSave Venice has an average of thirty restorations in progress at any given time, including buildings, paintings, statuary, books, and archives. Scholarship is supported through fellowships, exhibitions, conferences, and summer internships. Other educational efforts include numerous publications and an annual lecture series in Venice, New York, Boston, and Los Angeles.\n\nAmong the largest projects have been:\n\nThe Rosand Library and Study Center (RLSC) was established in 2014 when David Rosand (1938-2014), professor of art history at Columbia University and Save Venice board member, bequeathed his library of some 4500 volumes to Save Venice. The collection includes a variety of rare books, along with offprints, dissertations, and journals. While the focus of the library is the art and history of Venice, with particular depth in the Venetian Renaissance, the collection ranges from Chinese calligraphy to Abstract Expressionism. Additionally, the library is supplemented by Save Venice’s restoration files, which document its more than four decades of conservation projects, as well as the photographic archives of restorations. The library is open to readers by appointment. \n\nThe establishment and organization of the library was headed by Mary E. Frank, then chair of the Save Venice Education Resources Committee, who oversaw the cataloguing of the books in New York and their move to Save Venice’s Venetian office in Palazzo Contarini Polignac.\n\nOn June 18, 2015, both local and international supporters joined Save Venice to commemorate the official inauguration of the RLSC. \n\nThe Rosand Library & Study Center holds monthly roundtable discussions, usually in Italian, that focus on the latest conservation projects of Save Venice and feature presentations and dialogue between art restorers and art historians. \n\nThe New York Education & Enrichment Series organizes lectures throughout the year on Venetian art, history, and culture presented by art historians, conservators, curators, and artists. Lectures are often held at NYU’s Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marimò and the Italian Cultural Institute. \n\nTypically held at the historic Chilton Club in Back Bay, the Boston Chapter maintains a series of three lectures, organized in the winter/spring, on topics related to Venetian history, art, architecture, or music, as well as an Annual General Meeting in the early autumn. \n\nHeld every other year in Venice, the four-day gala often takes as its theme an event associated with Venice, such as Carnival in February, or the Biennale in June, or Regatta Week in late August. The gala gives its guests an opportunity to experience the city of Venice at a special seasonal moment and also to see Save Venice’s restoration work first-hand.\n\nThe annual masked ball held in New York is a black-tie fundraising dinner that aims to recreate lavishly the spirit of Venice for an evening and promote the art, culture, and traditions of the city. \n\nPast events in Boston include a costume ball and silent auction recreating the 1961 Festival del Cinema on the Lido (2006); a black-tie dinner followed by an Edwardian brunch, both celebrating Italian artistic inspiration, and held inside the historic Ames-Webster Mansion in Back Bay (2010); a “Library at Night” fundraiser at The Boston Public Library (2013); a celebration of Tony Duquette and Elsie de Wolfe with a lecture and book signing of “The Walk to Elsie’s” with authors Hutton Wilkinson and M. Flynn Kuhnert (2015); and a masked ball at the Algonquin Club in Back Bay (2016).\n\nThe mission of the Young Friends of Save Venice is to involve young supporters (up to 39 years old) in the preservation of Venice’s artistic patrimony. The Young Friends group in New York have played a major role in the planning of the annual ball in New York, and have raised more than five million dollars for restorations in Venice. In Boston since the late -1990s, the Young Friends of Save Venice brought in a cohort of much-needed younger members and raised large sums through a series of Carnevale and other themed parties in the winter.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was formerly a professor of history at, and later served as President of, the former St. John's Seminary College (closed 2002) in Camarillo, California. Additionally, he is known for his extensive writings about the history of the Catholic Church in Mexico and the devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe.\n\nPoole was born in Oxnard, California, the son of Beatrice Hessie Smith and Joseph Outhwaite Poole, Sr., and was raised in North Hollywood. While in grammar schools there, his classmates included both the sons of the noted singer, Bing Crosby, as well as the future Cardinal Roger Mahony. For high school, he attended Los Angeles College, which was a minor seminary run by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles for high-school age boys who were considering the priesthood.\n\nUpon his graduation in 1947 he joined the Congregation of the Mission of Saint Vincent de Paul, taking his vows in 1949. He did his seminary studies at the Vincentian seminary in Perryville, Missouri, earning a bachelor's degree in 1952. He completed his theological studies and was ordained in 1956, afterwards teaching in seminaries in the Midwestern United States. He received a Master's degree in Spanish literature in 1958 and then in 1961 his doctorate in history, both from St. Louis University.\n\nAlthough his focus had been American and European history, Poole's dissertation was titled \"The Indian Problem in the Third Mexican Provincial Council, 1585\" in which he analyzed recently found documents from the first Provincial Councils of the Catholic Church in Mexico.\n\nPoole wrote an article in 1964 for the Jesuit magazine \"America\" entitled \"Tomorrow's Seminaries\", in which he reflected on his experiences from teaching seminarians. The article was a sensation in Church circles, and he was soon approached to write a book on the topic. He contracted with the American branch of the German publishing house Herder & Herder, which specialized in works on Catholic topics. They published his book, \"Seminary in Crisis\" in 1965. He was involved as an expert consultant on seminary formation for the United States Conference of Bishops and other authorities for the next twenty years.\n\nHe continued to take an interest in the Council which he had studied for his dissertation, and wrote several articles on it for scholarly journals with Hispanic focus. As a result, he was led to translate the \"Apologia\" of the Spanish Dominican friar and bishop, Bartolomé de las Casas, who was a major defender of Native American rights in the new colonies of the Spanish Empire. This was a Latin work of the speeches Las Casas delivered at the Valladolid debate of 1550-1551. This was published in 1974 by Northern Illinois University Press; a second edition appeared in 1992 and is still in print.\n\nPoole also researched the life of Pedro Moya de Contreras, the third Archbishop of Mexico, who had convoked and presided at the Third Mexican Council. This biography was published by the University of California Press in 1987. A second, revised edition was published by the University of Oklahoma Press in 2011, and a Spanish translation by the Colegio de Michoacán, Mexico. His research into the archbishop's life caused him to be interested in that of the prelate's mentor, Juan de Ovando. In 2004 the University of Oklahoma Press published the biography, \"Juan de Ovando: Governing the Spanish Empire in the Reign of Philip II\".\n\nIn 1971 Poole was assigned to teach Church history at St. John's Seminary College, which at that time was administered by his religious congregation for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. He was appointed as President of the College in 1980, but resigned in 1984 due to a disagreement with the Archdiocese about structural changes in the school.\n\nAfter his retirement from active teaching in 1990, Poole became the archivist for the Western Province of his Congregation.\n\nIn addition to that, though, he was able to work on an interest he had long felt on the history of the apparitions of Our Lady of Guadalupe. For this he undertook the study of Classical Nahuatl, and published several works in that field.\n\nPoole's writings regarding Our Lady of Guadalupe include the books \"Our Lady of Guadalupe: The Origins and Sources of a Mexican National Symbol, 1531-1797\", an English translation of Luis Laso de la Vega's Nahuatl account of the apparition, \"Huei tlamahuiçoltica\", and a translation and critical edition of two Nahuatl plays about the Virgin. In 2006 he published \"The Guadalupan Controversies in Mexico\", where, along with other experts in the field, he disputed the historicity of Juan Diego, the Aztec man to whom the Virgin is believed to have appeared. Poole opposed the efforts to have him declared a saint, in which he was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n"}

Next, God reveals to an angel that he will test Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice Isaac. The angel conveys this instruction to Abraham who, though he is distraught, agrees to comply with it. Abraham takes Isaac to the place of sacrifice, his grief made all the greater by Isaac (not yet knowing he is the \"qweke best\" intended for sacrifice) being eager to aid his father. When Abraham reveals that he means to kill him, Isaac at first pleads for his life. However, when he learns that it is God's will that he should die, Isaac acquiesces in his death, even urging his father not to tarry over the deed. Abraham binds Isaac so that he will not deflect his father's sword but when he draws that sword and prepares to strike, the angel appears and takes it out of his hand. The angel reveals that God is pleased with Abraham's obedience and that Isaac need not be sacrificed after all. Leaving them with a ram, the angel departs. As they make the offering, God appears above (the medieval custom was to have God act at a higher level than other characters) and promises them that “for thys dede | I schall mvltyplye yowres botheres [both] sede | As thyke as sterres be in the skye”. In an epilogue a doctor, a stock figure in medieval drama, appears and points the moral that we should obey God's commandments and not rail against the designs God has for us.\n\nThe text of the play was lost until the 19th century, when a manuscript was found in a commonplace book dating from around 1470–80 at Brome Manor, Suffolk, England. The manuscript itself has been dated at 1454 at the earliest. This manuscript is now housed at Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.\n\nWhile Joseph Quincy Adams reckoned the Brome Abraham “must be dated as early as the fourteenth century,”, most other scholars assign various periods of the fifteenth century for the play's composition.\n\nThe Brome Abraham's relation to the play of the same subject in the cycle of Chester Mystery Plays has attracted attention. A comparison of the texts reveals around 200 lines of striking similarity, in particular during the debates between Abraham and Isaac that are at the hearts of the plays. A. M. Kinghorn judged the Brome play to be a superior reworking of the Chester barbers' play of Abraham, and accordingly dated the play to late in the fifteenth century. However, comparing the two, J. Burke Severs decided that the Chester play was an expansion and reworking of the Brome one.\n\nIt is not known whether the play was originally part of a larger cycle of mystery plays, such as at Chester Mystery Plays and York Mystery Plays, or if it stood by itself, as Osborn Waterhouse of the Early English Text Society believed, though he conceded that it was to be supposed “that the stage was the usual pageant, and the mode of performance practically identical with that of the regular cycle plays.”\n\nThe play is often considered the best of Middle English Abraham plays, humane in its treatment of infanticide, inventive in its language; Lucy Toulmin Smith, a nineteenth-century editor, found it to be superior to others of the period on the same subject and in the twentieth century George K. Anderson thought the play, its \"human qualities\" and characterisation, \"unusually good\", and Gassner thought it \"a masterpiece\". Adams noted that it was often reprinted due to its being \"justly regarded as the best example of pathos in the early religious drama\".\n\nThe \"Brome Abraham\" was performed in 1980 by Poculi Ludique Societas in Toronto.\n\nAll of the surviving English mystery cycles deal with the story of Abraham and Isaac:\n\nThere is also another individual 15th-century English play on the binding of Isaac, the so-called \"Northampton Abraham\", which is sometimes also referred to as the \"Dublin Abraham\", as the manuscript is kept at Trinity College Library, Dublin. The subject also features in the first part of the Cornish language Ordinalia.\n\n\n"}

Many of these reservists were the only breadwinners for their families, while the wealthy were able to hire substitutes.\n\nMinister of War Arsenio Linares y Pombo called up the Third Mixed Brigade of \"Cazadores\" (Light Infantry), which was composed of both active and reserve units in Catalonia. Among these were 520 men who had completed active duty six years earlier, and who had not anticipated further service. Many of the Cazadores, plus other reservists, were the only breadwinners for their families. One could hire a substitute if unable or unwilling to fight, but this cost 6,000 \"reales\" which was beyond the means of most laborers, who did not earn more than 20 \"reales\" or 5 pesetas a day, barely enough to sustain themselves and their families. Accordingly the well-off were better placed to legally avoid further service than members of the working classes. Finally, conscripted service in North Africa for the perceived benefit only of wealthy mining interests was deeply unpopular. \n\nThe incident began when \"a party of conscripts boarded ships owned by the marquess of Comillas, a noted Catholic industrialist, en route for Morocco. The soldiers were accompanied by patriotic addresses, the Royal March, and religious medals distributed by pious well dressed ladies. Spain's narrow social construction was thus on display for all to see, an affluent Catholic oligarchy impervious to the rise of secular mass politics. As the crowd jeered and whistled, emblems of the Sacred Heart were thrown into the sea.\" The rebellion had started.\n\nThese actions, coupled with anarchist, anti-militarist, and anti-colonial philosophies shared by many in the city (Barcelona later became a stronghold for the anarchists during the Spanish Civil War), resulted in the union \"Solidaridad Obrera\" - directed by a committee of anarchists and socialists - calling a general strike against Maura's call-up of the reservists on Monday 26 July 1909. Although the civil governor Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo had received ample warning of the growing discontent, acts of vandalism were provoked by elements called the \"jóvenes bárbaros\" (Young Barbarians), who were associated with the Radical Republican Party (Partido Republicano Radical) of Alejandro Lerroux.\n\nBy Tuesday workers had occupied much of central Barcelona, halting troop trains and overturning trams. By Thursday, there was street fighting, with a general eruption of riots, strikes, and the burnings of convents.\n\nMany of the rioters were antimilitarist, anticolonial and anticlerical. The rioters considered the Roman Catholic Church to form part of the corrupt bourgeois class whose sons did not have to go to war, and much public opinion had been turned against the Church by anarchist elements within the city. Thus not only were convents burned, but sepulchers were profaned and graves were emptied. Of 112 buildings set fire to during the disturbances, 80 were church-owned or associated.\n\nAfter disturbances in downtown Barcelona, civil guards and police fired on demonstrators in Las Ramblas, resulting in the construction of barricades in the streets and the proclamation of martial law. The government, declaring a state of war, ordered troops to end the revolt. Working class conscripts recruited from Barcelona and already stationed in the city, were considered unreliable under the circumstances. Accordingly, other army units were brought in from Valencia, Zaragoza, Pamplona and Burgos. These finally ended the revolt, causing dozens of deaths.\n\nPolice and army casualties were eight dead and 124 wounded.\nOf the civilians, 104–150 were reportedly killed. More than 1,700 individuals were indicted in military courts for \"armed rebellion\". Five were sentenced to death and executed (including Francesc Ferrer, founder of the Escuela Moderna); 59 received sentences of life imprisonment. Alejandro Lerroux fled into exile.\n\nGeneral European condemnation in the press was immediate. King Alfonso XIII, alarmed by the reaction at home and abroad, dismissed Premier Antonio Maura from power afterward, replacing him with Segismundo Moret.\n\n"}

{"id": "2267847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267847", "title": "Unilineal evolution", "text": "Unilineal evolution\n\nUnilineal evolution, also referred to as classical social evolution, is a 19th-century social theory about the evolution of societies and cultures. It was composed of many competing theories by various anthropologists and sociologists, who believed that Western culture is the contemporary pinnacle of social evolution. Different social status is aligned in a single line that moves from most primitive to most civilized. This theory is now generally considered obsolete in academic circles.\n\nTheories of social and cultural evolution are common in modern European thought. Prior to the 18th century, Europeans predominantly believed that societies on Earth were in a state of decline. European society held up the world of antiquity as a standard to aspire to, and ancient Greece and ancient Rome produced levels of technical accomplishment which Europeans of the Middle Ages sought to emulate. At the same time, Christianity taught that people lived in a debased world fundamentally inferior to the Garden of Eden and Heaven. During the Age of Enlightenment, however, European self-confidence grew and the notion of progress became increasingly popular. It was during this period that what would later become known as 'sociological and cultural evolution' would have its roots.\n\nThe Enlightenment thinkers often speculated that societies progressed through stages of increasing development and looked for the logic, order and the set of scientific truths that determined the course of human history. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, for example, argued that social development was an inevitable and determined process, similar to an acorn which has no choice but to become an oak tree. Likewise, it was assumed that societies start out primitive, perhaps in a Hobbesian state of nature, and naturally progress toward something resembling industrial Europe.\n\nWhile earlier authors such as Michel de Montaigne discussed how societies change through time, it was truly the Scottish Enlightenment which proved key in the development of cultural evolution. After Scotland's union with England in 1707, several Scottish thinkers pondered on the relationship between progress and the 'decadence' brought about by increased trade with England and the affluence it produced. The result was a series of 'conjectural histories'. Authors such as Adam Ferguson, John Millar, and Adam Smith argued that all societies pass through a series of four stages: hunting and gathering, pastoralism and nomadism, agricultural, and finally a stage of commerce. These thinkers thus understood the changes Scotland was undergoing as a transition from an agricultural to a mercantile society.\n\nPhilosophical concepts of progress (such as those expounded by the German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel) developed as well during this period. In France authors such as Claude Adrien Helvétius and other philosophers were influenced by this Scottish tradition. Later thinkers such as Comte de Saint-Simon developed these ideas. Auguste Comte in particular presented a coherent view of social progress and a new discipline to study it—sociology.\n\nThese developments took place in a wider context. The first process was colonialism. Although Imperial powers settled most differences of opinion with their colonial subjects with force, increased awareness of non-Western peoples raised new questions for European scholars about the nature of society and culture. Similarly, effective administration required some degree of understanding of other cultures. Emerging theories of social evolution allowed Europeans to organize their new knowledge in a way that reflected and justified their increasing political and economic domination of others: colonized people were less-evolved, colonizing people were more evolved. The second process was the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism which allowed and promoted continual revolutions in the means of production. Emerging theories of social evolution reflected a belief that the changes in Europe wrought by the Industrial Revolution and capitalism were obvious improvements. Industrialization, combined with the intense political change brought about by the French Revolution and US Constitution which were paving the way for the dominance of democracy, forced European thinkers to reconsider some of their assumptions about how society was organized.\n\nEventually, in the 19th century, three great classical theories of social and historical change were created: the social evolutionism theory, the social cycle theory and the Marxist historical materialism theory. Those theories had one common factor: they all agreed that the history of humanity is pursuing a certain fixed path, most likely that of the social progress. Thus, each past event is not only chronologically, but causally tied to the present and future events. Those theories postulated that by recreating the sequence of those events, sociology could discover the laws of history.\n\nWhile social evolutionists agree that the evolution-like process leads to social progress, classical social evolutionists have developed many different theories, known as theories of unilineal evolution. Social evolutionism was the prevailing theory of early socio-cultural anthropology and social commentary, and is associated with scholars like Auguste Comte, Edward Burnett Tylor, Lewis Henry Morgan, and Herbert Spencer. Social evolutionism represented an attempt to formalize social thinking along scientific lines, later influenced by the biological theory of evolution. If organisms could develop over time according to discernible, deterministic laws, then it seemed reasonable that societies could as well. This really marks the beginning of Anthropology as a scientific discipline and a departure from traditional religious views of \"primitive\" cultures.\n\nThe term \"classical social evolutionism\" is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer (who coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest\") and William Graham Sumner. In many ways Spencer's theory of 'cosmic evolution' has much more in common with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Auguste Comte than with contemporary works of Charles Darwin. Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as 'Social Evolutionism'. Although he wrote that societies over time progressed, and that progress was accomplished through competition, he stressed that the individual (rather than the collectivity) is the unit of analysis that evolves, that evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon.\n\nBoth Spencer and Comte view the society as a kind of organism subject to the process of growth—from simplicity to complexity, from chaos to order, from generalization to specialization, from flexibility to organization. They agreed that the process of societies growth can be divided into certain stages, have their beginning and eventual end, and that this growth is in fact social progress—each newer, more evolved society is better. Thus progressivism became one of the basic ideas underlying the theory of social evolutionism.\n\nAuguste Comte, known as father of sociology, formulated the law of three stages: human development progresses from the theological stage, in which nature was mythically conceived and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from supernatural beings, through metaphysical stage in which nature was conceived of as a result of obscure forces and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from them until the final positive stage in which all abstract and obscure forces are discarded, and natural phenomena are explained by their constant relationship. This progress is forced through the development of human mind, and increasing application of thought, reasoning and logic to the understanding of world.\n\nHerbert Spencer believed that society was evolving toward increasing freedom for individuals; and so held that government intervention, ought to be minimal in social and political life, differentiated between two phases of development, focusing is on the type of internal regulation within societies. Thus, he differentiated between military and industrial societies. The earlier, more primitive military society has a goal of conquest and defence, is centralised, economically self-sufficient, collectivistic, puts the good of the group over the good of the individual, uses compulsion, force, and repression, rewards loyalty, obedience and discipline. The industrial society has a goal of production and trade, is decentralised, interconnected with other societies via economic relations, achieves its goals through voluntary cooperation and individual self-restraint, treats the good of the individual as the highest value, regulates the social life via voluntary relations, and values initiative, independence, and innovation.\n\nRegardless of how scholars of Spencer interpret his relation to Darwin, Spencer proved to be an incredibly popular figure in the 1870s, particularly in the United States. Authors such as Edward L. Youmans, William Graham Sumner, John Fiske, John W. Burgess, Lester Frank Ward, Lewis H. Morgan and other thinkers of the gilded age all developed theories of social evolutionism as a result of their exposure to Spencer as well as Darwin.\n\nLewis H. Morgan, an anthropologist whose ideas have had much impact on sociology, in his 1877 classic \"Ancient Societies\" differentiated between three eras: savagery, barbarism and civilisation, which are divided by technological inventions, like fire, bow, pottery in savage era, domestication of animals, agriculture, metalworking in barbarian era and alphabet and writing in civilisation era. Thus Morgan introduced a link between the social progress and technological progress. Morgan viewed the technological progress as a force behind social progress, and any social change—in social institutions, organisations or ideologies have their beginning in the change of technology. Morgan's theories were popularised by Friedrich Engels, who based his famous work \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\" on it. For Engels and other Marxists, this theory was important as it supported their conviction that materialistic factors—economical and technological—are decisive in shaping the fate of humanity.\n\nÉmile Durkheim, another of the 'fathers' of sociology, has developed a similar, dichotomical view of social progress. His key concept was social solidarity, as he defined the social evolution in terms of progressing from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity. In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together. In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation is extensive. Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on population growth and increasing population density, second on increasing 'morality density' (development of more complex social interactions) and thirdly, on the increasing specialisation in workplace. To Durkheim, the most important factor in the social progress is the division of labor.\n\nAnthropologists Edward Burnett Tylor in England and Lewis H. Morgan in the United States worked with data from indigenous people, whom they claimed represented earlier stages of cultural evolution that gave insight into the process and progression of cultural evolution. Morgan would later have a significant influence on Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who developed a theory of cultural evolution in which the internal contradictions in society created a series of escalating stages that ended in a socialist society (see Marxism). Tylor and Morgan elaborated upon, modified and expanded the theory of unilinear evolution, specifying criteria for categorizing cultures according to their standing within a fixed system of growth of humanity as a whole while examining the modes and mechanisms of this growth.\n\nTheir analysis of cross-cultural data was based on three assumptions:\nTheorists usually measured progression (that is, the difference between one stage and the next) in terms of increasing social complexity (including class differentiation and a complex division of labor), or an increase in intellectual, theological, and aesthetic sophistication. These 19th-century ethnologists used these principles primarily to explain differences in religious beliefs and kinship terminologies among various societies.\n\nThere were however notable differences between the work of Lester Frank Ward's and Tylor's approaches. Lester Frank Ward developed Spencer's theory but unlike Spencer, who considered the evolution to be general process applicable to the entire world, physical and sociological, Ward differentiated sociological evolution from biological evolution. He stressed that humans create goals for themselves and strive to realise them, whereas there is no such intelligence and awareness guiding the non-human world, which develops more or less at random. He created a hierarchy of evolution processes. First, there is cosmogenesis, creation and evolution of the world. Then, after life develops, there is biogenesis. Development of humanity leads to anthropogenesis, which is influenced by the human mind. Finally, when society develops, so does sociogenesis, which is the science of shaping the society to fit with various political, cultural and ideological goals.\n\nEdward Burnett Tylor, pioneer of anthropology, focused on the evolution of culture worldwide, noting that culture is an important part of every society and that it is also subject to the process of evolution. He believed that societies were at different stages of cultural development and that the purpose of anthropology was to reconstruct the evolution of culture, from primitive beginnings to the modern state.\n\nFerdinand Tönnies describes the evolution as the development from informal society, where people have many liberties and there are few laws and obligations, to modern, formal rational society, dominated by traditions and laws and are restricted from acting as they wish. He also notes that there is a tendency of standardization and unification, when all smaller societies are absorbed into the single, large, modern society. Thus Tönnies can be said to describe part of the process known today as the globalisation. Tönnies was also one of the first sociologists to claim that the evolution of society is not necessarily going in the right direction, that the social progress is not perfect, it can even be called a regress as the newer, more evolved societies are obtained only after paying a high costs, resulting in decreasing satisfaction of individuals making up that society. Tönnies' work became the foundation of neo-evolutionism.\n\nThe early 20th century inaugurated a period of systematic critical examination, and rejection of unilineal theories of cultural evolution. Cultural anthropologists such as Franz Boas, typically regarded as the leader of anthropology's rejection of classical social evolutionism, used sophisticated ethnography and more rigorous empirical methods to argue that Spencer, Tylor, and Morgan's theories were speculative and systematically misrepresented ethnographic data. Additionally, they rejected the distinction between \"primitive\" and \"civilized\" (or \"modern\"), pointing out that so-called primitive contemporary societies have just as much history, and were just as evolved, as so-called civilized societies. They therefore argued that any attempt to use this theory to reconstruct the histories of non-literate (i.e. leaving no historical documents) peoples is entirely speculative and unscientific. They observed that the postulated progression, a stage of civilization identical to that of modern Europe, is ethnocentric. They also pointed out that the theory assumes that societies are clearly bounded and distinct, when in fact cultural traits and forms often cross social boundaries and diffuse among many different societies (and is thus an important mechanism of change). Boas in his culture history approach focused on anthropological fieldwork in an attempt to identify factual processes instead of what he criticized as speculative stages of growth.\n\nLater critics observed that this assumption of firmly bounded societies was proposed precisely at the time when European powers were colonizing non-Western societies, and was thus self-serving. Many anthropologists and social theorists now consider unilineal cultural and social evolution a Western myth seldom based on solid empirical grounds. Critical theorists argue that notions of social evolution are simply justifications for power by the elites of society. Finally, the devastating World Wars that occurred between 1914 and 1945 crippled Europe's self-confidence. After millions of deaths, genocide, and the destruction of Europe's industrial infrastructure, the idea of progress seemed dubious at best.\n\nThus modern socio-cultural evolutionism rejects most of classical social evolutionism due to various theoretical problems:\n\nBecause social evolution was posited as a scientific theory, it was often used to support unjust and often racist social practices—particularly colonialism, slavery, and the unequal economic conditions present within industrialized Europe.\n\n"}

{"id": "52335237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52335237", "title": "Xiao Han", "text": "Xiao Han\n\nXiao Han (蕭翰) (d. 949), probably né Shulü Han (述律翰), also named Dilie (敵烈), courtesy name Hanzhen (寒真), was a general of the Khitan Liao dynasty. After a brief Liao conquest of central China after Liao's second emperor Emperor Taizong destroyed Later Jin, Xiao was left in control of Later Jin's former capital Daliang, but was unable to hold it. He later plotted against Emperor Taizong's nephew and successor Emperor Shizong and was executed.\n\nIt is not known when Xiao Han was born. His father was Xiao Dilu (蕭敵魯) — probably still using the surname of Shulü (述律) at the time — who was a chancellor of Khitan Empire (which would later become Liao) northern court, and who was a brother of Empress Shulü Ping, the wife of Khitan's first emperor Emperor Taizu and a son of Emperor Taizu's aunt. Despite this close relationship, at some point, Xiao Han's mother was put to death by Empress Shulü, causing him to resent the empress from that point on.\n\nThe earliest reference to Xiao Han's military career was in 922, when Zhang Wenli, then in control of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), was under the attack by the army of Khitan's southern neighbor Jin and sought Khitan aid. While the Chinese accounts were that then Jin-commander Li Sizhao (adoptive cousin of Jin's prince Li Cunxu) died in battle with Zhang's army, Xiao's biography in the \"History of Liao\" contained a different narrative — that it was Xiao, whom Emperor Taizu sent to aid Zhang, who killed Li Sizhao.\n\nIn any case, after Emperor Taizu's death and succession by Emperor Taizu's son Emperor Taizong — who had married Xiao Han's sister Xiao Wen as his empress, and whose sister, according to the Chinese historical source \"Zizhi Tongjian\", Xiao Han might have married, although it might have been a confusion with Xiao Han's later marriage — Xiao Han became the commander of Emperor Taizong's Han guards. In 945 (by which time Emperor Taizong had changed the name of his Khitan state to Liao, and by which time central China was ruled by Later Jin), when Emperor Taizong's army was battling that of the Later Jin general Du Wei and initially prevailed, Xiao advocated having the Liao cavalry get off their horses and shooting at Du's army with bows. Emperor Taizong agreed, but once the Liao cavalry soldiers did so, a Later Jin counterattack caused the battle to go against Liao with heavy losses, much to Emperor Taizong's regret.\n\nBy spring 947, Emperor Taizong had entered Later Jin's capital Daliang and taken its emperor Shi Chonggui captive. He initially declared himself the emperor of China as well, but soon tired of Han rebellions. He decided to return to Liao proper, and he left Xiao Han in charge of Daliang, as the military governor (\"Jiedushi\") of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered at Daliang). Xiao wanted to seize some 50 remaining Later Jin ladies in waiting from Zide Palace (滋德宮), but the eunuch in charge, Zhang Huan (張環), refused. He forcibly broke down the palace door and seized the ladies in waiting, and then burned Zhang to death by holding heated iron against Zhang's body.\n\nBy summer 947, Emperor Taizong had died on the way back to Liao proper, and had been succeeded by his nephew Yelü Ruan (as Emperor Shizong). Xiao himself was facing increasing pressure from Han rebellions, and he considered how he could withdraw from Daliang safely, particularly with one of the main resisters to Liao rule, Liu Zhiyuan (who had declared himself emperor of a new state later known as Later Han, bearing down on him. He decided to claim that Emperor Taizong had ordered that he turn over central China over to Li Congyi, a prince of Later Jin's predecessor state Later Tang. He forcibly seized Li and Li's mother Consort Dowager Wang from Luoyang and had them brought to Daliang, and then declared Li emperor, before withdrawing. (Li later surrendered to Liu, but was killed.)\n\nAs Xiao withdrew toward Liao proper, when he reached Heng Prefecture (恆州, Chengde's capital), he and another Liao general, Yelü Mada (耶律麻荅), had soldiers surround the mansion of an ethnically Han chancellor, Zhang Li, as Yelü Mada and he both bore grudges against Zhang. He wanted to kill Zhang, but Yelü Mada persuaded him not to, although Zhang soon died in anger. Xiao joined Emperor Shizong on the way back to Liao proper, as Emperor Shizong prepared to confront the army of Empress Dowager Shulü, who wanted Emperor Taizong's younger brother Yelü Lihu to be emperor. As the two armies met, Empress Dowager Shulü inquired of Xiao, \"What resentment do you have that you rebelled against me?\" He responded to her, \"Your subject's mother was sinless, but the Empress Dowager killed her. I cannot fail to have anger toward you.\" Later, after Empress Dowager Shulü decided to capitulate based on the advice of Yelü Wuzhi (耶律屋質), Emperor Shizong was able to take the throne. In 948, Xiao married Emperor Shizong's sister Yelü Abuli (耶律阿不里).\n\nAlso in 948, Xiao entered into a conspiracy against Emperor Shizong with Emperor Taizong's son Yelü Tiande (耶律天德), Emperor Taizong's cousin Yelü Liuge (耶律劉哥), and Yelü Liuge's brother Yelü Pendu (耶律盆都). When their plot was discovered, Yelü Tiande was executed; Yelü Liuge was exiled; and Yelü Pendu was sent as an emissary to Xiajiasi. Xiao was caned, but after he swore that he was not involved, was released. In 949, however, he and Yelü Abuli tried to write Emperor Taizu's younger brother Yelü Anduan (耶律安端) to try to persuade Yelü Anduan to join a new conspiracy. Their letter was intercepted by Yelü Wuzhi, who presented it to Emperor Shizong. As a result, Xiao was executed, and Yelü Abuli was imprisoned, and she died of illness while imprisoned.\n\n"}
