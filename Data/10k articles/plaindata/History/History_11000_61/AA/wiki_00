The major outbreak of violence took place on the night of Friday 10/11 July, with smaller disturbances on the following two nights.\n\nThe riots were characterised by the Scarman report into the 1981 riots in England as \"copycat riots\" – taking place after the Brixton riots in London, and around the same time as the Toxteth riots in Liverpool and the Moss Side riots in Manchester – though some have argued that this is an oversimplification. The immediate flashpoint was an attack on a locally well-known Police Superintendent who was trying to calm rumours of an impending march by the right-wing National Front. The following disturbances resulted in 121 arrests and 40 injuries to police officers, alongside widespread damage to property.\n\nBefore the riots Handsworth had been considered to be a good example of successful community policing, though local Black British youths later disputed the claim that relations between them and the police had been amicable: around 40% of them had been stopped and searched over the previous 12 months. Handsworth had a mixed population of white, black and Asian residents, but surveys after the riots showed little evidence of significant racial tension. A week before the riots, during the weekend that saw CS gas used against rioters for the first time on the British Mainland in Toxteth, Liverpool, a reporter from \"The Times\" had visited a festival in Handsworth Park and found \"8,000 people, black and white\" in \"a spirit as amiable and peaceful as a rural village fete\". The most common reasons for the riots reported by participants were unemployment, boredom and the imitation of events elsewhere.\n\n"}

In contrast, Aboriginal people were losing their freedom. In 1871 the Board developed controls over where people could live and work, what they could do and who they could meet or marry. They removed Aboriginal children from their families, starting the process that created the Stolen Generation.\n\nIn 1886, Victoria's parliament passed what became known as the Half-Caste Act and started to remove Aboriginal people of mixed descent, known as \"half-castes\", from the Aboriginal stations or reserves to force them to assimilate into white society. These expulsions separated families and communities, causing distress and leading to protest. Nevertheless, the Board refused to assist the expelled people. It was assumed that the expulsions would lead to the decline in the population of the reserves and their eventual closure. The failure of this policy and its inhumanity led to Victoria's \"Aborigines Act\" of 1910 and \"Aboriginal Lands Act\" of 1970, which abandoned this policy.\n\n"}

Benda is best known as the author of the \"Geschichte der Stadt Gablonz und ihrer Umgebung\" (\"History of the Town of Jablonec nad Nisou\"), which was published in 1876-77.\n\nBenda was born on 27 November 1845 as a German-speaking Bohemian in the town of Jablonec nad Nisou (now in the Czech Republic). Most sources indicate he was born in 1845 and died in 1878 but several sources say he was born in 1841 and died in 1876.\n\nHe was the last of a notable family of Jizera glass engravers in the region, going back several centuries. His father, Edward Benda (1819-1901), was a member of the Rifle Brigade Jablonec (Schützenkorps). Benda attended the local school and was then taught the glass family trade. In 1866, he was sent with the Imperial Army to participate in the Austro-Prussian War. After returning, he began extensive research in local historical studies. \nBenda became a prominent figure in public and social life in Jablonec, a member of several associations and served on the council. He was particularly involved in the Industrial and Educational Support Association (\"Industrieller Bildungs und Unterstützungsverein\") and saw the importance of education in promoting economic development. From 1872, he was responsible for the federal library and in 1875 he became president of the Pindter Heinrich Association, until his death. Well connected politically, Benda was a noted liberal activist in the region and also served on the board of directors of the Duchcov-Podmokly Railway along with Herbert Gutman, Dr. Moriz Aron, and Richard Lederer.\n\nHe is best known as the author of the \"Geschichte der Stadt Gablonz und ihrer Umgebung\" which was published in 1876-77, shortly before his death. The book was the first complete history of the town, and took the perspective of the Jablonec craftsman, with attention to the social and economic life of the town, history and business development and civil society. In his work, Benda reported that in 1865 there were only 69 people in Jablonec, in comparison to 1876 when there were 145 in the whole district. The third section of the book is devoted to the Hussite Wars of the Prussian-Austrians; Benda, like his father, was interested in the military and weaponry. The fourth section is dedicated to local administration and the court and district affairs; and the fifth section, on industry, covers the important local industries including linen, cloth, manufacture of paper boxes, oil paintings and glass. The book also covers the ethnographic history of the city including its superstitions, tales and legends.\n\nIn the autumn of 1878 Benda contracted typhoid and died, on 12 November 1878, at almost 33 years of age. Today, Benda's book on the history of Jablonec is permanently on public display in the reading room of the Museum of Glass and Jewellery in Jablonec.\n\n"}

ALF is a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\n\nThe ALF was founded in April 1969, as a front of the Iraqi-led faction of the Ba'ath Party, then led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr. The ALF has always followed Iraqi government policy on all matters. In line with the pan-Arab ideology of the Ba'ath Party, the ALF was initially opposed to \"Palestinization\" of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, preferring to argue in terms of the wider Arab world's war with Israel, which it regarded as under the natural leadership of Iraq.\n\nThe ALF was the main group active in Iraq's small Palestinian population of approximately 34,000, but a very minor group in all other Palestinian communities. It has maintained a small following in the refugee camps of Lebanon, and has a minuscule presence in the Palestinian territories. Samir Sanunu is the representative of ALF in Lebanon.\n\nThe first leader of ALF was its secretary-general, Zeid Heidar. Heidar was born in Syria in the 1930s into a family of Arab nationalists. In 1956 he joined the Ba'ath Party in Syria. In 1968 he went to Iraq after the coup and was a part of the Ba'ath Party in Iraq. In 1969, he was appointed by the government of Iraq secretary-general of the Ba'ath Party in Palestine, the ALF. In June 1969 the ALF became a member of the newly formed PLO, a device for Iraq to be able to influence the PLO and the events in Palestine. In 1974, the ALF joined the Rejectionist Front, initially strongly backed by Iraq, which was formed by hard-line Palestinian factions which rejected what they perceived as the increasing moderation of the PLO.\n\nAfter the PLO entered into the Oslo Accords with Israel, the ALF opposed the accords, in line with Iraqi government policy. This brought about a split in the ALF in 1993, with a pro-Arafat Oslo faction becoming the Palestinian Arab Front and re-locating to the Palestinian territories; while the remainder of the ALF remaining in the Rejectionist Front.\n\nOther leaders of ALF have included Munif al-Razzaz, Abd al-Wahhab al-Kayyali and Abd al-Rahim Ahmad. al-Kayyali became secretary-general in at least 1972-74, and served on the PLO Executive Council from January 1973. He was assassinated in Beirut in 1981 by unidentified gunmen. Ahmad was the secretary-general from 1975 (possibly 1974) until his death in 1991, and was a member of PLO Executive Council from 1977. The present secretary-general is Rakad Salem (Abu Mahmoud) who was held in Israeli jail between 2001 and 2006.\n\nThe ALF gained some significance during the al-Aqsa Intifada, which started in 2000, as a distributor of financial contributions from the Iraqi government to families of \"martyrs\" with extra grants for the families of suicide bombers.\n\nAfter the 2003 American invasion of Iraq, the fall of the Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist government, and dissolution of the Ba'ath Party, large numbers of the Palestinian refugees who had been living in Iraq were forced to flee Iraq, and many ALF members fled the country for security reasons for Lebanon and the West Bank.\n\nToday, the secretary-general of ALF continues to be Rakad Salem, who holds Iraqi citizenship. He was imprisoned by Israel in 2001 for distributing Iraqi funds to families of suicide bombers. He was one of 57 Palestinians released in 2006 as a goodwill gesture. The ALF continues to have a seat on the PLO Executive Committee, since 1993 held by Mahmoud Ismael. What the status and position of the ALF is since the 2003 end of Iraqi support is uncertain.\n\nThe headquarters of ALF are in Ramallah, West Bank. The ALF published a monthly newspaper, \"Sawt al-Jamahir\" (Arabic: \"Voice of the Masses\"), which was edited by Rakad Salem. The newspaper was financed by the Iraqi government until 2003, and it is uncertain whether the paper has continued to be published since then.\n\nALF has not been involved in armed attacks on Israel since at least the early 1990s, and it is no longer believed to possess any significant military capabilities. It is not designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States, and is not on the terrorist lists of the UN, the EU or any other country.\n\n"}

These caves are reported to occur within the front face of White Mountain. The mouths of the two smaller caves have collapsed. Only the largest cave, which is 6 meters (18 feet) high, can be entered. The vague resemblance of the top of White Mountain to a pyramid has been the focus of speculation.\n\nTwo pipe-like structures have been reported from the largest cave. One of these is described as being 40 cm (16 in) in diameter, one only preserved as a reddish-brown half-pipe formation. Dozens of upright pipe-like features, about 10 to 40 cm (4 to 16 inches) in diameter, were also found protruding from White Mountain above the largest cave.\n\nSimilar formations were found on shore and within Tuosu Lake, also transliterated as \"Lake Toson,\" which lies 80 meters (260 feet) from the mouth of the largest cave. On the beach of the lake, about 40 meters (130 feet) from the mouth of the largest cave, apparently flat-lying, hollow, pipe-like features were found, reddish-brown, and ranging in diameter from 2 to 4.5 cm (0.8 to 1.8 inch) and have an east–west orientation. Another group of similar features, presumably vertical, either protrude from or lie just below the surface of the lake, but the reports are unclear. Tuosu Lake is a saline and alkaline lake with a dominant bacterial population made of \"Halomonas\".\n\nSimilar features have been found elsewhere, e.g. naturally occurring sandstone Liesegang-ring \"pipes\" in Arkansas and \"hematite pipes\" and \"hematite columns\" found sandstones in Utah.\n\nAssociated with these pipe-like features are objects that were described as \"rusty scraps\" and \"strangely shaped stones\". Analysis of the former by Liu Shaolin at a local smeltery reportedly found that they consist of 30 percent ferric oxide (oxidized iron) and large amounts of silicon dioxide and calcium oxide. Because any metallurgical analysis reports the composition of a material analyzed not in terms of the actual minerals comprising it, but only in terms of percentages of the oxides of the specific elements present, the calcium present in the analyzed material could have been in the form of calcite, a mineral that naturally forms concretions.\n\nAccording to news stories, the pipes were first discovered by a group of scientists from the United States who were seeking dinosaur fossils. The scientists are said to have reported the formations to local authorities in Delingha. However, the pipes did not attract attention until a later report, possibly one of six made by Ye Zhou, appeared in the \"Henan Dahe Bao\" (河南大河报 'Henan Great River News') in June 2002. Quin Jianwen, a local official, discussed the pipe-like features with journalists of the Xinhua News Agency on June 16, 2002. The local government now promotes the features as a tourist attraction, to which road signs and tourist guides lead visitors.\n\nAccording to a 2003 article in the \"Xinmin Weekly\", Chinese scientists using atomic emission spectroscopy found the Baigong Pipes to contain organic matter of plant origin. In addition, the news article also stated that tree rings were found in sections of these rock formations and, as a result, they were judged to be fossil trees or tree roots..\n\nThe state-run newspaper \"People's Daily\" reported on a 2007 investigation in which a research fellow from the Chinese Earthquake Administration reported they had found some of the pipes to be highly radioactive.\n\n"}

In 1118 there is the first indirect reference to the existence of such a link in a document in which there is mention of a customs post in the vicinity of the present-day town of Zwickau. \n\nThe first direct reference is in 1143 when a document records a \"semita bohemica\" that ran from Altenburg via Waldenburg and Zschopau to Bohemia.

{"id": "44244983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44244983", "title": "Draped turban", "text": "Draped turban\n\nA draped turban or turban hat is a millinery design in which fabric is draped to create headwear closely moulded to the head. Sometimes it may be stiffened or padded, although simpler versions may just comprise wound fabric that is knotted or stitched. It may include a peak, feather or other details to add height. It generally covers most or all of the hair.\n\nIn fashion, the draped turban has a history dating back to at least the late 18th century, and had revivals in most decades of the 20th century. Notably, it rose to popularity in the 1910s as a symbol of eastern glamour, while in the 1940s it was worn by everyone from Hollywood stars to land girls. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was revived by designers including Biba in the UK and Halston in the US – and worn by royalty and hippies alike. More recently, new designs began appearing on the fashion catwalks and in the second \"Sex and the City\" movie.\n\nWhile earlier portraits show examples of the turban in women's dress – notably Vermeer's 1665 portrait \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" – the draped turban is first recorded as a widespread fashion in Britain in the late 18th century, rising to even greater popularity during the Regency era; this was a fashion said to be inspired by increased trade with India for the import of cottons. The fashion may also have been partly inspired by growing interest in, and knowledge of, the Ottoman Empire and Turkey. The writings of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu on Turkey are also said to have been an influence. There are several portraits of her in turban style headgear and the turban was also sometimes known as the \"turk\" or \"chiffonet\".\n\nThe style of turban was initially simple, in keeping with the drape of gowns of the time, but as its popularity developed it tended to follow the fashion in hair and became progressively larger as hairstyles became more elaborate. Turbans might be lavishly decorated with plumes for balls and functions, but also for daywear – as satirised in a 1796 James Gillray cartoon, \"High Change in Bond Street\". The fashion remained during the early decades of the 19th century, with examples of Paris and London fashions from the 1830s showing ornate turban headdresses topped with tall plumes.\n\nPaul Poiret, the so-called 'Sultan de la mode', included the turban in his revival of 'oriental' styles in the early 1910s. As part of his research Poiret visited the Victoria and Albert Museum in order to study its collection of antique Indian turbans, declaring \"I admired unwaveringly the diversity of their so logical and so elegant forms.\"\n\nTurbans continued gaining in popularity from the early 1920s. Some of this may have been due to the increasing availability of the motor car, since the close-fitting design helped to protect the hair and head from the elements. A 1923 fashion report in \"The Times\" described the arrival of neat leather caps and new turban designs, adding that the turban is: \"seen in many embroidered and swathed varieties, some of which are built on 'beret', others on Russian designs, turning right off the face, and some on close-fitting lines.\" Its popularity survived the decade, a 1929 newspaper report on the autumn Paris fashions noted that the cloche hat had given way to the Basque beret and the turban trimmed with ribbon bows. Designs were typically made of silk, felt or velvet and could be finished with additional details such as feathers or brooches.\n\nIn 1937, the turban hat was tipped as one of the \"smartest models in the new millinery\", with new designs being shown in heavier fabrics such as velvet. In London, \"The Times\" reported on a Paris ensemble of astrakhan fur coat with velvet dress and draped velvet turban to match. The following year, it featured a high draped turban with attached veil as being among the latest bridal fashions. \nThe hat remained popular in Europe throughout wartime – it may have been helped by the fact that women were working in manual jobs in factories and farms. It was a design that could be created with minimal sewing skills and helped to conceal the hair when access to hairdressers, shampoo, and even water, might be limited. Simple patterns for draped turbans had been published from the 1920s. The Ministry of Information in the UK showcased a turban as part of a series of photographs to promote possibilities for wartime chic during a period when utility clothing and rationing were interrupting the traditional fashion industry. While DIY turbans were easy to construct – a wartime British Pathé film even demonstrated how to make a selection of designs with a couple of knotted scarves as part of its \"Ways and Means\" series – many materials used for making hats were excluded from the worst rationing strictures during the war, and this may help to explain the rise in whimsical hat styles for those who could afford them.\n\nWhile the fashion for the turban was partly borne of necessity in Europe, it became chic when it appeared on the heads of Hollywood icons. The French milliner Madame Paulette (Pauline Adam de la Bruyère) is often credited with reviving the turban and claimed to have been inspired by the designs she saw on French girls cycling the streets of Paris during the war. She went on to create hats worn by Gloria Swanson, Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo. Later, she would also create designs for fashion houses such as Chanel and Ungaro Madame Agnès, who had trained under Caroline Reboux, was also designing turbans and a black fabric creation with ornate padded top-piece and scarf draping carried under the chin is part of the museum collection of the FIDM in Paris.\n\nWhile Lana Turner created an iconic image of femme fatale in turban in \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\", the growing US popularity of South American stars such as Carmen Miranda also raised the profile of the draped turban as glamour wear – Miranda wore hers in a variety of extreme permutations in her films.\n\nVersions of the draped turban started to gain in popularity again from the mid 1950s; in 1955, \"The Times\" reported on a Dior ensemble taking in the eastern trend and comprising sheath dress in brocaded silk, matching jacket trimmed with sable fur and brocaded silk draped turban. Turban styles were adapted to accommodate more bouffant hair styles. Milliner Claude Saint-Cyr – who designed hats for the Queen – featured a new supple felt turban in 1956 that covered the ears and rose to a draped peak at the back of the head.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the London boutique Biba featured turbans, often paired with kaftans or diaphanous blouses – a look in keeping with the prevailing trends for both 1920s/30s and eastern styles. Often turbans were created as part of eveningwear; an example of a Biba evening coat and matching turban in rayon and Lurex knit is now part of the Victoria and Albert Museum archive. American designer Halston also featured the turban for eveningwear, and dressed fashion icons such as Bianca Jagger. The fashion for draped turbans also spread beyond disco glamour – Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins and the Queen all wore them with daywear.\n\nTurbans were tipped as a potential eveningwear accessory in 2006, as part of a 1970s disco revival. They began appearing on the fashion catwalks in 2007 and made an appearance in \"Sex and the City 2\" – including a gold model from Ralph Lauren's 2009 collection.\n\n"}

Now in the Library of the University of Leipzig, the \"Ebers Papyrus\" is among the most important ancient Egyptian medical papyri. It is one of two of the oldest preserved medical documents anywhere—the other being the \"Edwin Smith Papyrus\" (\"ca.\" 1600 BCE).\n\nAt Göttingen he studied jurisprudence, and at Berlin Oriental languages and archaeology. Having made a special study of Egyptology, he became in 1865 \"Dozent\" in Egyptian language and antiquities at Jena, becoming professor in 1868. In 1870 he was appointed professor in these subjects at Leipzig. He had made two scientific journeys to Egypt, and his first work of importance, \"Ägypten und die Bücher Moses,\" appeared in 1867–1868. In 1874 he edited the celebrated medical papyrus (\"Papyrus Ebers\") which he had discovered in Thebes (translation by H. Joachim, 1890).\n\nEbers early conceived the idea of popularising Egyptian lore by means of historical romances. \"Eine ägyptische Königstochter\" was published in 1864 and obtained great success. His subsequent works of the same kind—\"Uarda\" (1877), \"Homo sum\" (1878), \"Die Schwestern\" (1880), \"Der Kaiser\" (1881), of which the scene is laid in Egypt at the time of Hadrian, \"Serapis\" (1885), \"Die Nilbraut\" (1887), and \"Kleopatra\" (1894), were also well received, and did much to make the public familiar with the discoveries of Egyptologists. Ebers also turned his attention to other fields of historical fiction—especially the 16th century (\"Die Frau Bürgermeisterin,\" 1882; \"Die Gred,\" 1887)—without, however, attaining the success of his Egyptian novels.\n\nHis other writings include a descriptive work on Egypt (\"Aegypten in Wort und Bild,\" 2nd ed., 1880); \"Palestine in Picture and Word\" (\"\"), an 1884 translation of the English series \"Picturesque Palestine, Sinai, and Egypt\"; a life (1885) of his old teacher, the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius; and a guide to Egypt (1886). In 1889, the state of his health led him to retire from his chair at Leipzig on a pension.\n\nEbers's \"Collected Works\" appeared in 25 volumes at Stuttgart (1893–1895). Many of his books have been translated into English. For his life, see his \"Die Geschichte meines Lebens\" (Stuttgart, 1893); also R. Gosche, \"G.

In 1773, he joined the order of Capuchin friars, and in 1779 was ordained priest. He had meanwhile continued his classical and philological studies, and his liberal views brought him into frequent conflict with his superiors.\n\nIn 1784, while at the monastery of Mödling, near Vienna, he wrote to the emperor Joseph II, making suggestions for the better education of the clergy and drawing his attention to the irregularities of the monasteries. The searching investigation which followed raised up against him many implacable enemies. In 1784 he was appointed professor of Oriental languages and hermeneutics in the university of Lemberg, when he took the degree of doctor of divinity; and shortly afterwards he was released from his monastic vows on the intervention of the emperor.\n\nIn 1788 he brought out his tragedy of \"Sidney\", an exposé of the tyranny of James II and of the fanaticism of the Roman Catholics in England. This was attacked so violently as profane and revolutionary that he was compelled to resign his office and seek refuge in Silesia. In Breslau he met with a cordial reception from G. W. Komn, the publisher, and was, moreover, subsequently employed by the prince of Carolath-Schbnaich as tutor to his sons. In 1791 Fessler was converted to Lutheranism and next year contracted an unhappy marriage, which was dissolved in 1802, when he married again.\n\nIn 1796 he went to Berlin, where he founded a humanitarian society. In April 1800, through his introduction, the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte was initiated into freemasonry in a Berlin lodge. Fessler was commissioned by the freemasons to assist Fichte in reforming the statutes and ritual of their lodge. At first Fichte was the warm admirer of Fessler, and was disposed to aid Fessler in his proposed reform. But later he became Fessler's bitter opponent. Their controversy attracted much attention among freemasons. Soon after this, Fessler obtained a government appointment in connection with the newly acquired Polish provinces, but in consequence of the battle of Jena (1806) he lost this office, and remained in very needy circumstances until 1809, when he was summoned to St. Petersburg by Alexander I, to fill the post of court councillor, the professorship of oriental languages and philosophy at the Alexander-Nevski Academy, and finally minister to the Court of St. James (Britain). This office, however, he was soon obliged to resign, owing to his alleged atheistic tendencies, but he was subsequently nominated a member of the legislative commission by the Emperor.\n\nIn 1815 he went with his family to Sarepta, where he joined the Moravian community and again became strongly orthodox. This cost him the loss of his salary, but it was restored to him upon his return in 1817. In November 1820, he was appointed consistorial president of the evangelical communities at Saratov and subsequently became chief superintendent of the Lutheran communities in St. Petersburg. In recognition of his important services to Hungary as a historian, he was in 1831 elected a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He died at St. Petersburg.\n\nFessler was a voluminous writer, and during his life exercised great influence; but, with the possible exception of the history of Hungary, none of his books has any value now. He did not pretend to any critical treatment of his materials, and most of his historical works are practically historical novels. He did much, however, to make the study of history popular. His works are all written in German.\n\nHis most important works are:\n\n"}

Perkins was perhaps the first mulatto commissioned officer in the Royal Navy. He rose from obscurity to be one of the most successful ship captains of the Georgian navy. He captained a 10-gun schooner during the American War of Independence and in a two-year period captured at least 315 enemy ships.\n\nLater in his career Perkins acted for the navy as a spy and undertook missions to Cuba and Saint-Domingue (modern day Haiti). At the start of the slave revolt in Saint-Domingue he was captured in Cap-Français and sentenced to death for supplying the rebel slave army with weapons.\n\nAfter his rescue he was promoted commander in 1797 and then post-captain in 1800. Perkins went on to cause an international incident with the Danes when he fired on two of their ships during peacetime. Toward the end of his career he participated in capture of the islands of Saint Eustatia and Saba from the French. Perkins also attacked a 74-gun ship-of-the-line with a 32-gun frigate.\n\nJohn Perkins was probably born in Kingston, Jamaica in the middle of the 18th century. Very little is known of his birth or early life. One account written 30 years after his death described him as of mixed race. \n\nIn 1775 Perkins first appears in the records of the Royal Navy when he was appointed to the 50-gun , the flagship of the commander-in-chief of the Jamaica station as an extra pilot. \"His knowledge of the different ports, &C. in the West Indies was, perhaps, seldom equalled, and never surpassed.\"\n\nIn 1778 he was placed in command of the schooner \"Punch\", a ship probably armed with ten 2 or 4-pounder guns, though no detailed records survive. At this time he received his nickname Jack Punch, most probably earned because of the name of his command. During the next two years Perkins claimed to have captured 315 ships, an average of three per week, a claim that was later endorsed by the Jamaican House of Assembly.\nAdmiral Sir Peter Parker, and subsequent admirals, used Perkins in clandestine missions against the French at Cap-Français, a province in the South West of Saint-Domingue, and the Spanish in Havana, Cuba. Parker eventually commissioned Perkins as a lieutenant and gave him command of . The 12-gun \"Endeavour\" was an American-built schooner with a keel of 60 feet and beam of 20. Governor Archibald Campbell stated in a letter of recommendation that \"By the gallant exertions of this officer some hundred vessels were taken, burnt, or destroyed, and above three thousand men added to the list of prisoners of war in favour of Britain; in short, the character and conduct of Captain Perkins were not less admired by his superior officers in Jamaica, than respected by those of the enemy.\"\nIn 1782 Perkins captured a much larger vessel containing several important French officers. The commander of the Jamaica station, Admiral George Rodney, promoted Perkins to master and commander of \"Endeavour\", and added two guns to her raising her armament to fourteen guns, thus putting her on the official Navy List as a sloop-of-war. Rodney's promotion of Perkins was disallowed. Rodney wrote later to Philip Stephens, First Secretary to the Admiralty, in an attempt to confirm the promotion. \"I must therefore desire you will please represent to their Lordships, that on my arrival at Jamaica, I found Mr. Perkins lieutenant and commander of the Endeavour schooner – that he bore an excellent character, and had done great service.\" Despite his request Perkins was demoted back to the rank of lieutenant and the guns ordered to be removed. At the end of the American War of Independence he was \"on the beach\" (meaning that he was without a posting on a ship) as a half-pay lieutenant. \nFor several years between 1783 and 1790 Perkins disappeared from the books of the Royal Navy. It may be during this time that he turned to piracy as there is a French source and several English records that describe him as such.\n\nIn 1790, fifteen years after he had first joined the navy, Perkins made an application to the Jamaican House of Assembly for their assistance in achieving his promotion. After presenting his certificates to the assembly, the assembly investigated Perkins’ claim and resolved to make an application to the Admiralty for his promotion to post-captain.\n\nIn 1790 Perkins volunteered once more and served under Admiral Philip Affleck. For several years there is no record that he held an official command but in 1792 Captain Thomas McNamara Russell of the 32-gun frigate , on a relief mission to the authorities on Saint-Domingue, was informed that a British officer was under arrest and due to be executed in Jérémie for supplying arms to the rebel slaves. Officially Britain and France were not at war and Russell requested that Perkins be released. The French authorities promised that he would be and then later refused. After numerous letters had been exchanged Russell determined that the French had no intention to release Perkins. Russell sailed around Cap-Français to Jérémie and met with the 12-gun under Captain Nowell. It was agreed that Nowell's first lieutenant, an officer named Godby, would go ashore and recover Perkins whilst the two ships remained offshore within cannon shot, ready to land an invasion force if need be. Lieutenant Godby landed and after negotiations Perkins was released. Perkins then disappears once more from the records for a short time.\n\nIn September 1793 Perkins returned to the books of the Navy. Perkins is listed as commanding , a 4-gun schooner.<ref name=\"ADM8/69\"> ADM 8/69 Admiralty Records held at the National Archives, Kew</ref> He accompanied Commodore John Ford's squadron when the British, at the request of French Royalists mounted a campaign against Saint-Domingue. On arrival Ford's squadron captured amongst other vessels a schooner belonging to the French Navy named \"Convention Nationale\". She was renamed and Ford gave command of her to Perkins. Ford described Perkins as \"an Officer of Zeal, Vigilance and Activity.\" In 1794 \"Marie Antoinette\" made up part of the squadron commanded by the newly promoted Rear-Admiral Ford that accompanied Brigadier-General John Whyte that briefly captured Port-au-Prince. At the time some forty five vessels lay in harbour and these were all made prizes. In 1796 \"Marie Antoinette\" made up part of a small squadron that captured the schooner \"Charlotte\" and brig \"Sally\". Perkins remained with her until he was promoted master and commander.\n\nThe circumstances of his promotion are unrecorded, but in 1797 Admiral Sir Hyde Parker promoted Perkins to commander of , a brig of 14 guns. Subsequently, HMS \"Drake\", in company with a squadron under Captain Hugh Pigot, consisting of the 32-gun frigates and , and the cutter , were involved in the cutting out of eight enemy ships at Port-de-Paix on 20 April 1797. On 25 October 1798 \"Drake\" captured the French privateer \"La Favorite\". The prize money for Perkins (amounting to 2/8 of the total value of the vessel) was 53 pounds 13 shillings and 9 pence. In inflation-adjusted terms this would be approximately £ as of 20.\n\nIn \"Drake\", in company with , Captain Poyntz, Perkins captured four French corvettes, the 18-gun \"Egyptienne\", the 16-gun \"Eole\", the 12-gun \"Levrier\" and the 8-gun \"Vengeur\" on 24 November 1799 off Cape Tiburon.\n\nPerkins was promoted on 6 September 1800 to post-captain in the 32-gun frigate . In early 1801 Perkins moved to the 22-gun . \n\nIn March 1801, \"Arab\", in company with the 18-gun British privateer \"Experiment\", caught and challenged two Danish vessels, the brig , under the command of Captain Carl Wilhelm Jessen, and the schooner \"Den Aarvaagne\". \"Arab\" approached the two Danish vessels and, according to Danish accounts, without warning, fired several broadsides at \"Lougen\" before the Danish ship was able to return fire. \"Lougen\", which had escaped serious damage, began to return fire steadily. \"Experiment\" initially attempted to capture \"Aarvaagne\", but \"Aarvaagne\" obeyed orders to stay out of the fight and instead escaped south to Christiansted on St Croix with its intelligence on British actions. \"Experiment\" then joined \"Arab\" in the attack on \"Lougen\", with the two British ships sandwiching the Danish ship. During the engagement, which lasted for over an hour, one of \"Lougen\"s shots struck the \"Arab\"s cathead and loosed the bower anchor. (Perkin's reported that it was the first shot from \"Lougen\" that loosed the bower anchor.) \"Arab\"s crew was unable to cut the anchor free, leaving \"Arab\" unable to manoeuvre effectively. This allowed Jessen to steer a course that brought him under the protection of the shore batteries and then into St Thomas. Captain Jessen of the \"Lougen\" was awarded a presentation sword made of gold, a medal and 400 rixdollars (the equivalent of a whole year's salary for a Captain in the Danish Navy) by the Danish government for his actions.\n\nOn 13 April 1801 \"Arab\" captured the Spanish privateer \"Duenda\".\n\nOn 16 April 1801 Perkins, in company with Colonel Richard Blunt and a detachment of the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), laid siege to and captured the wealthy islands of Sint Eustatius and Saba, capturing their French garrisons, forty-seven cannon and 338 barrels of gunpowder. Eustatia had been the most profitable of the islands in the Dutch West Indies.\n\nAfter several further cruises Perkins was transferred in 1802 into the 32-gun frigate .\n\nBetween 20 November and 4 December 1803 \"Tartar\" was in company with Commodore John Loring's squadron when the squadron captured the French ships of war \"Le Decouverte\", \"La Clorinde\", \"La Surveillante\", \"La Vertu\", and \"Le Cerf\". \"La Surveillante\" and \"La Clorinde\" were bought into British service. \"La Surveillante\" had on board at her surrender General Rochambeau the commander of the French forces on Saint-Domingue. On 25 July 1804, while in company with under Captain James Walker, \"Tartar\" was involved in the capture of the French 74-gun ship of the line \"Duquesne\", and two 16-gun brigs sailing with her. \"Tartar\" outsailed her larger companions and kept the \"Duquesne\" and her consorts engaged until the larger British ships came up and the French squadron surrendered. A seaman's share of the prize money aboard the \"Tartar\" for the capture was 6 shillings and 8 pence. A petty officer's share was 1 pound, 13 shillings and 11 pence.\n\nIn January 1804 Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the commander of the slave rebellion in Haiti declared independence from France. Perkins was sent by Admiral Duckworth and Governor Nugent in \"Tartar\" as a British observer to the island. Perkins was accompanied by Edward Corbet. Corbet was a government advisor appointed by Nugent. Perkins described the situation on Haiti in his official letters to the Admiral. \"I assure you that it is horrid to view the streets in different places stained with the Blood of these unfortunate people, whose bodies are now left exposed to view by the river and sea side. In hauling the seine the evening we came to our anchor several bodies got entangled in it, in fact such scenes of cruelty and devastation have been committed as is impossible to imagine or my pen describe.\"\n\nIn March 1804 Perkins resigned his commission on health grounds. It is rumoured that Perkins finally visited England in 1805 although there is no supporting evidence for this. There is no further record of his involvement with the Navy or Haiti. Perkins died on 27 January 1812 at his home in Jamaica. According to his obituary he suffered for many years with a condition described as \"asthma\" and that this was the cause of his demise.\n\nThere is no record of a wife and the records concerning his estate have disappeared.\nHis obituary in the Naval Chronicle described his actions while in command of the schooner \"Punch\": \n\n\n"}

It must have been between 1160 and 1209 that he held this position; but the date at which he lived and wrote cannot be more accurately determined. Up to the year 1139 he follows closely the history written by his predecessor, Prior Richard; thenceforward he is an independent though not a very valuable authority. He is best informed as to the events of the north country; his want of care, when he ventures farther afield, may be illustrated by the fact that he places in 1145 King Stephen's siege of Oxford, which really occurred in 1142.\n\nEven for northern affairs his chronology is faulty; from 1140 onwards his dates are uniformly one year too late. Prior Richard is not the only author to whom John is indebted; he incorporates in the annal of 1138 two other narratives of the Battle of the Standard, one in verse by the monk Serlo of Wilton, another in prose by Abbot Aelred of Rievaulx; and also a poem, by a Glasgow clerk, on the death of Somerled.\n\nThe one manuscript of John's chronicle is a late 12th-century copy; Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 139.

Her areas of expertise include female iconography, mother-right cultures and the origins of patriarchy.\n\nIn 1970, Dashu founded the Suppressed Histories Archives to research and document women's history and to make the full spectrum of women's history and culture visible and accessible. The collection includes 15,000 slides and 30,000 digital images. Since the early 1970s, Dashu has delivered visual presentations on women's history throughout North America, Europe and Australia.\n\nDashu is the author of \"Witches and Pagans: Women in European Folk Religion, 700–1100\" (2016), the first volume of a planned 16-volume series called \"Secret History of the Witches.\"\n\nDashu grew up in West Chicago, Illinois. In 1968, she earned a scholarship to Harvard University, where she began her research in women's history. Facing \"entrenched resistance\" to feminist scholarship, she chose to leave the university to become an independent scholar. After founding the Suppressed Histories Archives in 1970, she began presenting on women's history in 1973, sharing slides of her research at feminist bookstores, cafe and women's centers. Dashu's slide presentations offered visual history at a time when lesbian history and art was not easily accessible.\n\nIn 1976, Dashu was involved in the Inez García defense committee. In the early 1980s, Dashu worked in the Household Workers' Rights organization, a Union WAGE project established in 1979 for working women.\n\nDashu's decades-long work has focused on women's history around the world, including Europe, Asia and Africa. Areas of focus include women shamans and priestesses, witches and the witch trials, folk religion and pagan European traditions. Her work has cited evidence in support of egalitarian matrilineages, and she authored a critique of Cynthia Eller's \"The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory\" (2000). Her article \"Knocking Down Straw Dolls: A Critique of Cynthia Eller's The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory\" was reprinted in the journal \"Feminist Theology\" in 2005. Dashu has also published in the 2011 anthology \"Goddesses in World Culture\", edited by Patricia Monaghan.\n\nIn 2016, Dashu published \"Witches and Pagans: Women in European Folk Religion, 700-1100\". The work is the first volume of a 16-part series titled \"Secret History of the Witches\". The series explores the cultural history and suppression of women in Europe, spanning 2,000 years. The next volume, under the working title \"Pythias, Melissae and Pharmakides\", will focus on Greece.\n\nPresenting materials from the Suppressed Histories Archives, Dashu has given talks at hundreds of universities, conferences and festivals around the world. In addition to the images and articles available on her website, Dashu also offers online courses on women's history via webcast.\n\nDashu served as a historical consultant for Donna Deitch's 1975 documentary \"Woman to Woman\" and for the San Francisco Women's Building mural in 1994.\n\nDashu makes feminist paintings, posters and prints. Her art has appeared in \"Witch Dream Comix\" (1975), the anthology \"She Is Everywhere!: An Anthology of Writing in Womanist/Feminist Spirituality\" (2005), \"Sinister Wisdom\", Daughters of the Moon Tarot, and in books by Judy Grahn, Diane Stein, and Martha Shelley, as well as other feminist, lesbian, and pagan publications. She also provided the illustrations for her book \"Witches and Pagans\" and uses her own illustrations to recreate incomplete or damaged artifacts shown in her presentations.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1983, Dashu co-produced the weekly radio program \"A World Wind\" with Chana Wilson on KPFA in Berkeley, California. The program featured international women's music, news and culture. In 1981, Dashu produced the women's history program \"Flashes from Our Past\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30726095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30726095", "title": "Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt", "text": "Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt\n\nIn Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood ( \"gammāʿat /al-ikhwan/el-ekhwan al-muslimīn\", ) – a Sunni Islamist religious, political, and social movement – is, or was, considered the largest, best-organized political force in Egypt, with adherents estimated to number between 2 and 2.5 million. Founded in Egypt by Hassan al-Banna in March 1928, the group spread to other Muslim countries but has its largest, or one of its largest, organizations in Egypt, despite a succession of government crackdowns in 1948, 1954, 1965, and 2013 after plots, or alleged plots, of assassination and overthrow were uncovered.\n\nFollowing the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, it first had great success. It launched a civic political party—the Freedom and Justice Party—to contest elections, which it described as having \"the same mission and goals, but different roles\" than the Brotherhood, and agreeing to honor all Egypt's international agreements. The party won almost half the seats in the 2011–12 parliamentary elections, and its candidate, Mohamed Morsi, won the June 2012 presidential election. However President Mohammad Morsi was overthrown after mass protests within a year and a crackdown ensued that some have called more damaging to the movement than any \"in eight decades\". \nHundreds of members were killed, and hundreds—including Morsi and most of the Brotherhood's leadership—were imprisoned. Among the general Egyptian population, a \"huge hostility\" was felt towards the MB. \nIn September 2013, an Egyptian court banned the Brotherhood and its associations, and ordered that its assets be seized; \nand in December the military-backed interim government declared the movement a terrorist group following the bombing of security directorate building in Mansoura, (the Brotherhood later issued a statement condemning violence).\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna, an Egyptian schoolteacher, who preached implementing traditional Islamic Sharia law in all aspects of life, from everyday problems to the organization of the government. Inspired by Islamic reformers Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida, he believed that Islam had lost its social dominance to corrupt Western influences and British imperial rule.\nThe organisation initially focused on educational and charitable work, but quickly grew to become a major political force as well. (Sources disagree as to whether the Brotherhood was hostile to independent working-class and popular organisations, or supported efforts to create trades unions and unemployment benefits.) It championed the cause of poor Muslims, and played a prominent role in the Egyptian nationalist movement, fighting the British, Egypt's occupier/dominator. It engaged in espionage and sabotage, as well as support for terrorist activities orchestrated by Haj Amin al-Husseini in British Mandate Palestine, and up to and during World War II some association with Britain's enemy, the German Nazis, dissemination of anti-Jewish, and anti-Western propaganda.\n\nOver the years, the Brotherhood spread to other Muslim countries, including Syria Jordan, Tunisia, etc. as well as countries where Muslims are in the minority. These groups are sometimes described as \"very loosely affiliated\" with the Egyptian branch and each other.\n\nIn November 1948, following several bombings and assassination attempts, the government arrested 32 leaders of the Brotherhood's \"secret apparatus\" and banned the Brotherhood. At this time the Brotherhood was estimated to have 2000 branches and 500,000 members or sympathizers. In succeeding months Egypt's prime minister was assassinated by Brotherhood member, and following that Al-Banna himself was assassinated in what is thought to be a cycle of retaliation.\n\nIn 1952, members of the Muslim Brotherhood are accused of taking part in an event that marked the end of Egypt's \"liberal, progressive, cosmopolitan\" era – an arson fire that destroyed some \"750 buildings\" in downtown Cairo – mainly night clubs, theatres, hotels, and restaurants frequented by British and other foreigners.\n\nIn 1952 the monarchy was overthrown by nationalist military officers of the Free Officers Movement. While the Brotherhood supported the coup it vigorously opposed the secularist constitution that the coup leaders were developing. In 1954 another unsuccessful assassination was attempted against Egypt's prime minister (Gamal Abdel Nasser), and blamed on the \"secret apparatus\" of the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood was again banned and this time thousands of its members were imprisoned, many of them held for years in prisons and sometimes tortured.\n\nOne of them was the very influential theorist, Sayyid Qutb, who before being executed in 1966, issued a manifesto proclaiming that Muslim society had become \"jahiliyya\" (no longer Islamic) and that Islam must be restored by the overthrow of Muslim states by an Islamic vanguard, also revitalising the ideal of Islamic universalism. Qutb's ideology became very influential outside of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, but the Brotherhood's leadership distanced itself from Qutb and adhered to nonviolent reformist posture.\n\nImprisoned Brothers were gradually released after Anwar Sadat became president of Egypt in 1970, and were sometimes enlisted to help fight Sadat's leftist opposition. Brethren were allowed to publish the magazine Da'wa, though the organization remained illegal. During this time, more radical Qutb-inspired Islamist groups blossomed, and after Sadat signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1979, the Muslim Brotherhood became confirmed enemies of Sadat. Sadat was assassinated by a violent Islamist group Tanzim al-Jihad on 6 October 1981, shortly after he had Brotherhood leaders (and many other opposition leaders) arrested.\n\nAgain with a new president, (Hosni Mubarak), Brotherhood leaders (Supreme Guide Umar al-Tilmisani and others) were released from prison. Mubarak cracked down hard against radical Islamists but offered an \"olive branch\" to the more moderate Brethren. The brethren reciprocated, going so far as to endorse Mubarak's candidacy for president in 1987.\n\nThe Brotherhood dominated the professional and student associations of Egypt and was famous for its network of social services in neighborhoods and villages. However, the government did not approve of the Brotherhood's renewed influence (it was still technically illegal), and resorted to repressive measures starting in 1992.\n\nIn the 2000 parliamentary elections, the Muslim Brotherhood won 17 parliamentary seats. In 2005, it won 88 seats (20% of the total compared to 14 seats for the legally approved opposition parties) to form the largest opposition bloc, despite the arrest of hundreds of Brotherhood members. It lost almost all but one of these seats in the much-less-free 2010 election, which was marred by massive arrests of both Brethren and polling place observers. Under Egypt's emergency law Brethren could only stand as independents, but were easily identified since they campaigned under the slogan – 'Islam Is the Solution'.\n\nDuring and after the 2005 election the Brethren launched what some have called a \"charm offensive.\" Its leadership talked about its \"responsibility to lead reform and change in Egypt.\" It addressed the `Coptic issue', insinuating that the Brethren would do away with Egypt's decades-old church building-permit system that Coptic Christians felt was discriminatory. Internationally the Brethren launched an English-language website and some of the Muslim Brotherhood's leaders participated in an Initiative to 'Re-Introduc[e] the Brotherhood to the West', \"listing and addressing many 'Western misconceptions about the Brotherhood.'\"\n\nSeeing this campaign as a direct threat to its position as an indispensable ally of the west against radical Islamism, the Egyptian government introduced an amendment to the constitution that removed the reference to Islam as 'the religion of the state,` and would have allowed women and Christians to run for the presidency. Brotherhood MPs responded by walking out of parliament rather than voting on the bill. In addition, the movement has also reportedly played into the government's hands provoking non-Islamist Egyptians by staging a militia-style march by masked Brotherhood students at Cairo's Al Azhar University, complete with uniforms and martial arts drills, reminding many of the Brotherhood's era of 'secret cells'.\n\nAccording to another observer: \n\nafter a number of conciliatory engagements and interactions with the West\", the Brotherhood retreated into its comfort zone of inflammatory rhetoric intended for local consumption: all suicide bombers are `martyrs`; `Israel` regularly became `the Jews`; even its theological discourse became more confrontational and oriented to social conservatism.\n\nTwo years later the Egyptian government amended the constitution, skewing future representation against independent candidates for parliament, which are the only candidates the Brotherhood can field. The state delayed local council elections from 2006 to 2008, disqualifying most Muslim Brotherhood candidates. The Muslim Brotherhood boycotted the election. The government incarcerated thousands of rank-and-file Muslim Brotherhood members in a wave of arrests and military trials, the harshest such security clampdown on the Brotherhood \"in decades.\" \n\nFollowing the 2011 revolution that overthrew Hosni Mubarak, the Brotherhood was legalized and emerged as \"the most powerful\" and \"most cohesive political movement\" in Egypt. Its newly formed political party won two referendums, far more seats than any other party in the 2011–12 parliamentary election, and its candidate Mohamed Morsi won the 2012 presidential election. However within a year there were mass protests against his rule and he was overthrown by the military.\n\nIn the January–February 2011 uprising itself, the Brotherhood remained \"on the sidelines\", but even before it was officially legalized it launched a new party called the Freedom and Justice Party. The party rejected \"the candidacy of women or Copts for Egypt's presidency\", although it did not oppose their taking cabinet positions. In its first election the party won almost half of 498 seats in the 2011–12 Egyptian parliamentary election.\n\nIn the first couple of years after the revolution, critics speculated about both secret collusion between the Brotherhood and the powerful (secular oriented) military, and a looming showdown between the two. The Brotherhood and the military both supported the March constitutional referendum which most Egyptian liberals opposed as favoring established political organizations. It was said to have stopped the \"second revolution\" against military rule by remaining uninvolved during violent clashes between revolutionaries and the military in late 2011, and protests over the thousands of secretive military trials of civilians.\n\nEgyptian author Ezzedine C. Fishere worried that the Brotherhood had \n\nmanaged to alienate its revolutionary and democratic partners and to scare important segments of society, especially women and Christians. Neither the Brotherhood nor the generals showed willingness to share power and both were keen on marginalising the revolutionary and democratic forces. It is as if they were clearing the stage for their eventual showdown.\n\nWhile the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) dissolved the parliament dominated by the Brotherhood and other Islamic parties, the Brotherhood won the presidential election, defeating Ahmed Shafik, a former military officer and prime minister of Mubarak.\n\nWithin a short period, serious public opposition developed to President Morsi. In late November 2012, he issued a temporary constitutional declaration granting himself the power to legislate without judicial oversight or review of his acts, on the grounds that he needed to \"protect\" the nation from the Mubarak-era power structure. He also put a draft constitution to a referendum that opponents complained was \"an Islamist coup.\" These issues—and concerns over the prosecutions of journalists, the unleashing of pro-Brotherhood gangs on nonviolent demonstrators; the continuation of military trials; and new laws that permitted detention without judicial review for up to 30 days, and impunity given to Islamist radical attacks on Christians and other minorities—brought hundreds of thousands of protesters to the streets starting in November 2012. During Morsi's year-long rule there were 9,000 protests and strikes.\n\nBy April 2013, Egypt had \"become increasingly divided\" between President Mohamed Morsi and \"Islamist allies\" and an opposition of \"moderate Muslims, Christians and liberals\". Opponents accused \"Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood of seeking to monopolize power, while Morsi's allies say the opposition is trying to destabilize the country to derail the elected leadership\". Adding to the unrest were severe fuel shortages and electricity outages—which evidence suggests were orchestrated by Mubarak-era Egyptian elites.\n\nBy 29 June the Tamarod (rebellion) movement claimed it had collected more than 22 million signatures calling for Morsi to step down. A day later, mass demonstrations occurred across Egypt urging Morsi to step down. Demonstrations in support of him were organized as a response.\n\nOn 3 July, the head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi responded to the demands of the protesters in Tahrir Square during the 30 June Demonstration and after discussing the issue with the main political parties and religious leaders of the country and removed President Mohamed Morsi and suspended the constitution. Brotherhood supporters staged sit-ins throughout the country, setting up camps and shutting down traffic.\n\nThe crackdown that followed has been called the worst for the Brotherhood's organization \"in eight decades\". On 14 August, the military declared a month-long state of emergency in response to their violence after removing the camps. In retaliation Brotherhood supporters looted and burned police stations and dozens of churches.\n\nThe sit-in dispersal lead to clashes, resulting in the deaths of 638 people and injury of some 4000. By 19 August, al Jazeera reported that \"most\" of the Brotherhood's leaders were in custody. On that day Supreme Leader Mohammed Badie was arrested, crossing a \"red line\", as even Hosni Mubarak had never arrested him.\n\nOn 23 September, a court ordered the group outlawed and its assets seized. Two days later security forces shuttered the main office of the newspaper of the Freedom and Justice Party, and confiscated its equipment. Muslim Brotherhood criticized the decision to seize its assets and those of MB linked charities as opening the door to Christian charities and part of a campaign against Islam.\n\nSome question whether the military and security services can effectively crush the Brotherhood. Unlike the last major crackdown in the 1950s, when Egypt's \"public sphere and information space\" was tightly-controlled, the Brotherhood has a larger and broader international presence beyond the reach of Egypt's government to sustain itself.\n\nOthers—such as Hussein Ibish and journalist Peter Hessler—believe its \"unlikely\" that the Brotherhood will return to political prominence soon, because of its aggressive but incompetent performance while in power. According to Hessler, the group antagonized the powerful entrenched government institutions, the news media and millions of non-supporters, acting \"with just enough aggression to provoke an outsized response\", while not having nearly enough military resources to defend itself against that response. It \"no longer leads the anti-government movement,\" and has even lost its \"religious credibility\", such that \"at mosques, even staunch opponents of the coup told me that they wouldn't vote for the Brotherhood again.\" Hessler also argues that \"the strong showing for the party in post-revolution elections exaggerated MB strength, noting that in one Upper Egytpian district (El-Balyana), the MB party had dominated the Presidential vote and nearly won a parliamentary seat, but the Brotherhood itself had only ten local members in a district of approximately six hundred thousand. Since then its support has declined drastically.\".\n\nHussein Ibish believes the Brotherhood is being challenged by the Salafi movement, and is undergoing a crisis so severe that \"what ultimately emerges from the current wreckage [may] be unrecognisably different\" from the traditional Brotherhood.\n\nA day after the 2013 bombing of a security directorate building in Mansoura, the interim government declared the Muslim Brotherhood movement a terrorist group—despite the fact that another group, the Sinai-based Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, claimed responsibility for the blast. On 24 March 2014, an Egyptian court sentenced 529 members of the Muslim Brotherhood to death, an act described by Amnesty International as \"the largest single batch of simultaneous death sentences we've seen in recent years […] anywhere in the world.\" On 15 April 2014, an Egyptian court banned current and former members of the Muslim Brotherhood from running in the presidential and parliamentary elections.\n\nIn 2015, a split appeared in the Brotherhood between an old guard afraid that resorting to violence could mean the annihilation of the Brotherhood, and a new leadership, joined by the rank and file, that believed that \"only by bleeding\" the regime could it \"be brought to its knees.\" \nIn May, Mahmoud Hussein, the (former) secretary general of the Muslim Brotherhood, reported on his Facebook page that Mahmoud Ezzat had \"taken over\" the Muslim Brotherhood. On the official Brotherhood website a spokesperson replied: \"We affirm that the group's institutions, which was elected by its base last February, manages its affairs and that only the official spokesman of the group and its official outlets represent the group and its opinion.\"\n\nObservers attribute the dispute to a number of factors. Robert Worth notes the disastrous situation into which the old leadership had led the MB, the disruption of the MB hierarchy by the \"decapitation\" of the leadership through arrests and imprisonment, and the dislocation of exile (often to Turkey and Qatar) of much of the rank and file. Samuel Tadros credits changes in the MB to the influence of Revolutionary Salafists, many of whom allied with the Brotherhood in the year before the As-Sisi coup. When Islamists broke through security barriers to join the Brotherhood at Nahda and Rab'a squares, \"ideas flowed freely and bonds were created\", with the Salafists influencing MB more than vice versa. Salafist joined the anti-coup alliance of the MB, and its youth moved from using molotov cocktails in self-defense to offense. The MB structure broken, young members are now influenced by \"takfiri sheikhs\" on satellite channels.\n\nMembers blamed President Morsi not for alienating non-members with his non-inclusive rule, but for being insufficiently revolutionary and not crushing the state institutions that would later overthrow him. The slogan, \"Our peacefulness is stronger than bullets,\" has been replaced by \"All that is below bullets is peacefulness.\" A new body, the Administrative Office for Egyptians Abroad, clashed with the Old Guard of Ibrahim Mounir, Deputy Supreme Guide Mahmoud Ghozlan and others.\n\nAt the same time as the split, a statement titled \"Nidaa al-Kinana\" (Egypt Call) signed by 159 international MB and Egyptian Salafist Islamic scholars and endorsed by the Brotherhood was released. It declared the As-Sisi regime criminal and murderous and stated that the current regime was an enemy of Islam, and it was the religious duty of Muslims to \"eliminate it by all legitimate means. ... Any leaders, judges, officers, soldiers, media figures or politicians, and anyone [else] who is definitely proved to be involved (even if only through incitement) in violating the honor of women, shedding the blood of innocents and unlawful killing – [all these] are murderers according to the shari'a, and must be punished according to the shari'a.\" (The punishment for murderers per sharia is death.) As of mid-2015 over 600,000 people had \"endorsed\" the petition.\n\nIn June 2015, the \"Revolutionary Punishment\" movement celebrated six months of attacks, including the killing of 157 and wounding of 452 security personal, the destruction of 162 military cars and 53 buildings.\n\n\"Murshid\" (\"supreme guide\" or \"General leaders\" (G.L.)) of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt have been:\n\nThe Brotherhood itself describes the \"principles of the Muslim Brotherhood\" as including firstly the introduction of the Islamic Sharia as \"the basis controlling the affairs of state and society;\" and secondly work to unify \"Islamic countries and states, mainly among the Arab states, and liberating them from foreign imperialism\". It denounces the \"catchy and effective terms and phrases\" like \"fundamentalist\" and \"political Islam\" which it claims are used by \"Western Media\" to pigeonhole the group, and points to its \"15 Principles\" for an Egyptian National Charter, including \"freedom of personal conviction... opinion... forming political parties... public gatherings... free and fair elections...\"\n\nIn October 2007, the Muslim Brotherhood issued a detailed political platform. Amongst other things it called for a board of Muslim clerics to oversee the government, and for limiting the office of the presidency to Muslim men. In the 'Issues and Problems' chapter of the platform, it declared that a woman was not suited to be president because the post's religious and military duties 'conflict with her nature, social and other humanitarian roles.' While underlining 'equality between men and women in terms of their human dignity,` the document warned against 'burdening women with duties against their nature or role in the family.'\n\nIn his writing, Hassan Al-Banna outlined a strategy for achieving power of three stages: \n\nThe Brotherhood's self-description as moderate and rejecting violence has created disagreement among observers. Political moderation is a contested concept, and various authors have a put forth a range of opinions on the issue. For some, this is a question of using violence or not: a Western author, (Eric Trager), interviewing 30 current and former members of the Brotherhood in 2011 and found that the Brethren he talked to emphasised \"important exceptions\" to the position of non-violence, namely conflicts in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, Iraq, and Palestine. Trager quotes the former Supreme Guide Mohammed Mahdi Akef as telling him \n\nWe believe that Zionism, the United States, and England are gangs that kill children and women and men and destroy houses and fields. ... Zionism is a gang, not a country. So we will resist them until they don't have a country.\n\nTrager and other have also noted the MB's use of the honorific \"sheikh\" to refer to Osama bin Laden. While the Brotherhood differs with bin Laden and al-Qaeda, it has not condemned them for the 9-11 attacks because it does not believe they were responsible. A recent statement by the Brotherhood on the issue of violence and assassinations condemned the killing of \"Sheikh Osama bin Laden\" by the United States, saying: \"The whole world, and especially the Muslims, have lived with a fierce media campaign to brand Islam as terrorism and describe the Muslims as violent by blaming the September 11th incident on al-Qaeda.\"\n\nAl-Qaeda was supported by Mohammed Mahdi Akef, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Bin Laden was praised by Akef.\n\nHowever, according to authors writing in the Council on Foreign Relations magazine Foreign Affairs: \"At various times in its history, the group has used or supported violence and has been repeatedly banned in Egypt for attempting to overthrow Cairo's secular government. Since the 1970s, however, the Egyptian Brotherhood has disavowed violence and sought to participate in Egyptian politics.\" Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor, calls the Brotherhood \"conservative and non-violent\".\n\nAccording to the Israeli-affiliated media-watchdog group Memri, the Arabic language (but not the English language) website of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood has displayed much anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content. A report by Memri found articles engaging in Holocaust denial, praising jihad and martyrdom, condemning the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, calling for the destruction of Israel, and condemning negotiations with non-Muslims to regain lands lost by Islam. A \"common motif\" of the website is Antisemitic conspiracy theories warning Muslims against \"the covetous and exploitative nature of the 'Jewish character'\".\n\nOn 13 March 2013, the Muslim Brotherhood released a statement opposing the UN declaration 'End Violence against Women' on the grounds that it would \"undermine Islamic ethics and destroy the family\", and \"would lead to complete disintegration of society\".\n\nIn the book \"Secret of the Temple\", written by Tharwat al-Khirbawy, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt, Khirbawy \"explores the ideology of Mursi and the small group of leaders at the top of the movement, examining their devotion to Sayyid Qutb, a radical ideologue executed in 1966 for plotting to kill president Gamal Abdel Nasser.\" The book has been \"dismissed by Brotherhood leaders as part of a smear campaign.\"\n\nTalking to television channel France 24 shortly before he was elected president, Mohammed Morsi stated: \"The majority of the people are Muslims and the non-Muslims, our brothers, are citizens with full responsibilities and rights and there is no difference between them. If any Muslim says anything other than this, he is not understanding Sharia.\"\n\nHowever, after he became president critics complained that attitudes of and actions by Brotherhood leaders concerning non-Muslims changed. In late April 2013 a fatwa issued by a member of the MB general guide's office -- 'Abd Al-Rahman Al-Barr (who is often referred to as the movement's mufti) -- forbade Muslims from greeting Christians on their Easter holiday, explaining that Easter and resurrection were contrary to the Muslim faith. \"Jesus did not die and was not crucified, but rather Allah gave him protection from the Jews and raised [Jesus] up to Him... which is why we do not greet anyone for something we strongly believe is wrong. ...\" The Israeli-affiliated media-watchdog group Memri quoted Coptic and opposition leaders attacking the fatwa and noting that in the past MB leaders and even Al-Barr himself had not only allowed but practiced the greeting of Christians on Easter. Columnist A'la Al-'Aribi in the daily Al-Wafd attacked the fatwa as \"politics disguised as shari'a...\" Al-Barr's previous \"view reflected the position of the MB at that time – but now that circumstances have changed [and the MB is in power], he has changed his position...\"\n\nAnother article in newsobserver.com noted President and former MB official Mohammed Morsi \"has done little to assuage concerns\" of Christians by being \"slow to condemn the latest round of sectarian violence\" in April 2013, not attend the naming of the new Coptic pope, and having no plans to attend Coptic Easter services – an annual custom of the former Egyptian President.\n\nIn August 2013, following the 3 July 2013 Coup and clashes between the military and Morsi supporters, there were widespread attacks on Christian Coptic churches and institutions. \"USA Today\" reported that \"forty churches have been looted and torched, while 23 others have been attacked and heavily damaged\". The Facebook page of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party was \"rife with false accusations meant to foment hatred against Copts\", according to journalist Kirsten Powers. The party's page claimed that the Church had declared \"war against Islam and Muslims\". Despite the Christians relatively minor role in the campaign against President Morsi, the page justified the attacks by saying: \"After all this people ask why they burn the churches.\" Later it posted: \"For every action there is a reaction\" and \"The Pope of the Church is involved in the removal of the first elected Islamist president. The Pope of the Church alleges Islamic Sharia is backwards, stubborn, and reactionary.\" On 15 August, nine Egyptian human rights groups under the umbrella group \"Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights\", released a statement saying,\n\nIn December … Brotherhood leaders began fomenting anti-Christian sectarian incitement. The anti-Coptic incitement and threats continued unabated up to the demonstrations of June 30 and, with the removal of President Morsi … morphed into sectarian violence, which was sanctioned by … the continued anti-Coptic rhetoric heard from the group's leaders on the stage … throughout the sit-in.\n\nThe Brotherhood applies a highly selective membership process which gives its \"internal cohesiveness and ideological rigidity\" and is unique among Egyptian political/social organizations in its \"breadth\" and \"depth\" of networks. The long (typically at least four and a half years) and closely monitored membership process is thought to have prevented infiltration by state security during the presidencies of Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak. Its structure bears some similarity to a similar Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, in having a hierarchical organization where many supporters do not reach the level of full members. Potential members are recruited by recruiters who do not at first identify themselves as Brothers to prospective members.\n\nEstimates of the Brotherhood's membership and supporters vary between 600,000 and 100,000. According to anthropologist Scott Atran, while the Brotherhood has 600,000 dues paying members in Egypt it can count on only 100,000 militants in a population of more than 80 million Egyptians. The \"New York Times\" describes it as having drawing on \"support from hundreds of thousands of members and millions of affiliates and sympathizers throughout\" Egypt.\n\nHow unified and powerful the Brotherhood is, is disputed. Former deputy chairman, Muhammad Habib has said, \"there are fissures\" in the Brotherhood, \"and they may be to the very core. There is concern among the younger members that the leadership does not understand what's going on around it.\" Another high-ranking member, Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, who was recently expelled from the Brotherhood, warned of the possibility of \"an explosion.\" Other observers (Eric Trager) have described the Brotherhood as \"Egypt's most cohesive political movement, with an unparalleled ability to mobilize its followers ...\"\n\nFollowing the 2013 crackdown, the \"most leaders\" of the top rank (the Brotherhood's Guidance Office), second rank (Shura Council) and third rank (heads of municipalities and administrative bureaus) are \"either in prison, exile or hiding\", according to Khalil al-Anani of Al-Monitor. Journalist Kareem Fahim, describes the group as having \"fallen back on the organizational structure that sustained it for decades\" when it was banned. He reports that the Brotherhood is \"becoming more decentralized, but also more cohesive and rigid\".\n\n\n\nThe brotherhood operates 21 hospitals throughout Egypt, providing modern medical care at subsidized prices. It also operates job-training programmes, schools in every governorate in the country and programs to support widows and orphans.\n\nAn estimated 1,000 of the roughly 5,000 legally registered NGOs and associations in Egypt are run by the Brotherhood according to Abul Futouh, a leading brotherhood member. Its clinics are reputed to have more available basic supplies and more up-to-date equipment. However, the Brotherhood's network of organizations is complex, sometimes operate under different names, and is difficult to track.\n\nThe Brotherhood's response to the 1992 earthquake in Cairo, where 50,000 people were made homeless, was an example of the group's effectiveness, compared to that of the Egyptian government. It quickly mobilized to provide victims with food and blankets and setting up makeshift medical clinics and tents for shelter.\n\nAccording to Kareem Fahim, following the 2013 crackdown members have started to abandon \"activities like preaching and social work\" as they focus on \"resistance to the military-backed government\".\n\nThe \"Muslim Sisterhood\" is the female division of the Muslim Brotherhood. The members of the Muslim Sisterhood have been traditionally more involved in charitable activities than other members of Muslim Brotherhood. They are credited with keeping the Brotherhood together during the dark days of the 1950s and 1960s when many male members were intentionally dispersed across Egypt's prisons in order to cripple the apparatus, but the sisters \"acted as an informal prison support network, carrying ideas and messages from prison to prison to sustain the Brotherhood, and were vital to their rebirth\".\n\nThe work of the Muslim Sisterhood has help to attract new members to the Muslim Brotherhood. Many of these members come from university campuses, mosques and trade unions. During the Egyptian revolution of 2011, members of the Muslim Sisterhood have become more politically active, and they participated in the founding of the Freedom and Justice Party by the Muslim Brotherhood in April 2011. Not an auxiliary group, they intend to play an equal role in the government.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "65218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65218", "title": "Pillars of Hercules", "text": "Pillars of Hercules\n\nThe Pillars of Hercules (Latin: \"Columnae Herculis\", Greek: Ἡράκλειαι Στῆλαι, Arabic: أعمدة هرقل / \"Aʿmidat Hiraql\", Spanish: \"Columnas de Hércules\") was the phrase that was applied in Antiquity to the promontories that flank the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. The northern Pillar, Calpe Mons, is the Rock of Gibraltar. A corresponding North African peak not being predominant, the identity of the southern Pillar, Abila Mons, has been disputed throughout history, with the two most likely candidates being Monte Hacho in Ceuta and Jebel Musa in Morocco.\n\nAccording to Greek mythology adopted by the Etruscans and Romans, when Hercules had to perform twelve labours, one of them (the tenth) was to fetch the Cattle of Geryon of the far West and bring them to Eurystheus; this marked the westward extent of his travels. A lost passage of Pindar quoted by Strabo was the earliest traceable reference in this context: \"the pillars which Pindar calls the 'gates of Gades' when he asserts that they are the farthermost limits reached by Heracles.\" Since there has been a one-to-one association between Heracles and Melqart since Herodotus, the \"Pillars of Melqart\" in the temple near Gades/Gádeira (modern Cádiz) have sometimes been considered to be the true \"Pillars of Hercules\".\n\nAccording to Plato's account, the lost realm of Atlantis was situated beyond the Pillars of Hercules, in effect placing it in the realm of the Unknown. Renaissance tradition says the pillars bore the warning \"Ne plus ultra\" (also \"Non plus ultra\", \"nothing further beyond\"), serving as a warning to sailors and navigators to go no further.\n\nAccording to some Roman sources, while on his way to the garden of the Hesperides on the island of Erytheia, Hercules had to cross the mountain that was once Atlas. Instead of climbing the great mountain, Hercules used his superhuman strength to smash through it. By doing so, he connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and formed the Strait of Gibraltar. One part of the split mountain is Gibraltar and the other is either Monte Hacho or Jebel Musa. These two mountains taken together have since then been known as the Pillars of Hercules, though other natural features have been associated with the name. Diodorus Siculus, however, held that instead of smashing through an isthmus to create the Straits of Gibraltar, Hercules \"narrowed\" an already existing strait to prevent monsters from the Atlantic Ocean from entering the Mediterranean Sea. In some versions, Heracles instead built the two to hold the sky away from the earth, liberating Atlas from his damnation. \n\nBeyond Gades, several important Mauretanian colonies (in modern-day Morocco) were founded by the Phoenicians as the Phoenician merchant navy pushed through the Pillars of Hercules and began constructing a series of bases along the Atlantic coast starting with Lixus in the north, then Chellah and finally Mogador.\n\nNear the eastern shore of the island of Gades/Gadeira (modern Cádiz, just beyond the strait) Strabo describes the westernmost temple of Tyrian Heracles, the god with whom Greeks associated the Phoenician and Punic Melqart, by \"interpretatio graeca\". Strabo notes that the two bronze pillars within the temple, each eight cubits high, were widely proclaimed to be the true Pillars of Hercules by many who had visited the place and had sacrificed to Heracles there. But Strabo believes the account to be fraudulent, in part noting that the inscriptions on those pillars mentioned nothing about Heracles, speaking only of the expenses incurred by the Phoenicians in their making. The columns of the Melqart temple at Tyre were also of religious significance.\n\nSyriac scholars were aware of the Pillars through their efforts to translate Greek scientific works into their language as well as into Arabic. The Syriac compendium of knowledge known as \"Ktaba d'ellat koll 'ellan\". \"The Cause of all Causes\", is unusual in asserting that there were three, not two, columns\n\nIn \"Inferno\" XXVI Dante Alighieri mentions Ulysses in the pit of the Fraudulent Counsellors and his voyage past the Pillars of Hercules. Ulysses justifies endangering his sailors by the fact that his goal is to gain knowledge of the unknown. After five months of navigation in the ocean, Ulysses sights the mountain of Purgatory but encounters a whirlwind from it that sinks his ship and all on it for their daring to approach Purgatory while alive, by their strength and wits alone.\nThe Pillars appear as supporters of the coat of arms of Spain, originating in the impresa of Spain's sixteenth century king Charles I, who was also the Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V. It was an idea of the Italian humanist Luigi Marliano. It bears the motto \"Plus Ultra\", Latin for \"further beyond\", implying that the pillars were a gateway.This was modified from the phrase \"Nec plus ultra\", \"Nothing more beyond\" after the discovery of the Americas, which laid to rest the idea of the Pillars of Hercules as the westernmost extremity of the inhabitable world which had prevailed since Antiquity.\n\nThe Pillars appear prominently on the engraved title page of Sir Francis Bacon's \"Instauratio Magna\" (\"Great Renewal\"), 1620, an unfinished work of which the second part was his influential \"Novum Organum\". The motto along the base says \"Multi pertransibunt et augebitur scientia\" (\"Many will pass through and knowledge will be the greater\"). The image was based on the use of the pillars in Spanish and Habsburg propaganda.\n\nOn the Spanish coast at Los Barrios are Torres de Hercules which are twin towers that were inspired by the \"Pillars of Hercules\". These towers were the tallest in Andalusia until Cajasol Tower was completed in Seville in 2015.\n\n"}

Conceived around the time of the Caxton Celebration of 1877, it was an ambitious expansion of a \"Specimens\" column then appearing in the \"Paper & Printing Trades Journal\", a widely read trade publication issued by London printers and publishers Field & Tuer and edited by Andrew White Tuer. \n\nThe official proposal was made in a letter written in 1879 by Thomas Hailing of the Oxford Printing Works, Cheltenham, to Tuer, who replied that if 100 printers would participate, his firm would handle the arrangements. Printers, and their employees and apprentices, were invited to send in examples of their work in the number of anticipated subscribers for each year. In return, they received a bound, collated set of all specimens accepted. The cost was one shilling (three shillings for American subscribers). For an additional cost, the finished volume was bound in half vellum laced with catgut. \n\nResponse to the call for specimens for the first issue exceeded all expectations, and publication, originally announced as biannual, was quickly changed to annual. John Ruskin praised the goals of the project in a letter quoted in the introduction to the first volume, and a copy of Volume VI was accepted by Queen Victoria.\n\nInitially most of the contributions came from Great Britain and the United States, but by the mid-1880s the \"Exchange\" included as many as 400 specimens from around the world. For the first three years, Tuer and his editorial assistant, Robert Hilton, commented frankly and often amusingly on each specimen, but with the increase in both number and international participation, detailed critiques became burdensome and, perhaps, politically sensitive. Volumes I–VIII (1880–1887) were published by Field & Tuer at the Leadenhall Press, London, and the content represented both old-style and new \"Artistic\" printing. \n\nAfter Volume VIII, Tuer turned publication over to Hilton, who had moved on to become editor of a new journal, the \"British Printer\", published by the firm of Raithby & Lawrence. The \"Exchange\" began to decline under Hilton's editorship, leaning heavily toward the new \"Leicester Free Style\" of typography developed by the firm's foreman Robert Grayson, and the venture ended a few years after Raithby & Lawrence sued Hilton for violating an agreement not to start a competing publication. The last two (much slimmer) volumes each covered two years, with the final one not issued until early 1898, containing only 123 specimens. \n\nAt its best, the \"Printers' International Specimen Exchange\" taught a generation of printers how to examine learn from printed work, and it inspired similar ventures in Germany, France, and the United States.\n\n\n"}

For example, in Europe, the Celts and the Germanic tribes are considered to have been protohistoric when they began appearing in Greek and Roman sources.\n\nProtohistoric may also refer to the transition period between the advent of literacy in a society and the writings of the first historians. The preservation of oral traditions may complicate matters as these can provide a secondary historical source for even earlier events. Colonial sites involving a literate group and a non-literate group are also studied as protohistoric situations.\n\nIt can also refer to a period in which fragmentary or external historical documents, not necessarily including a developed writing system, have been found. For instance, the Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea, the Yayoi and the Mississippian groups recorded by early European explorers are protohistoric.\n\nIn \"The Oxford Illustrated History of Prehistoric Europe\", an article by Timothy Taylor says, \n\nIn the abstract of a later paper on \"slavery in the first millennium Aegean, Carpatho-Balkan and Pontic regions\", Taylor, who is primarily an archaeologist, says, \n\nFor other examples, see also the writings of Brian Fagan on the protohistory of North America and the work of Muhammed Abdul Nayeem on that of the Arabian Peninsula\n\nAs with prehistory, determining when a culture may be considered prehistoric or protohistoric is sometimes difficult for archaeologists.

Many of these peoples of course also experienced periods of prehistory and history.\n\n\n"}

It has a population of 3,598 and is believed to be the world's only all-Jewish town outside Israel and the United States.\n\nThe village is located across the Qudiyalçay River (or Kudyal River) from the larger town of Quba. It is the primary settlement of Azerbaijan's population of highland, or mountain Jews who make up the population of approximately 4,000. The most widely spoken language in Qırmızı Qəsəbə is Juhuri. Qırmızı Qəsəbə is considered to be the world's last surviving shtetl.\n\nThe settlement is sometimes referred to as the Red Town or the Red Village, possibly because of the red tiling used on many of the roofs. Other sources attribute the name to the protected status the town received during the Soviet period, when it was shielded from persecution during World War II.\n\nInitially spread throughout the mountainous region, the Jewish population of the highlands became centered around Qaba. The settlement is sometimes referred to as the Red Town or the Red Village, possibly because of the red tiling used on many of the roofs.\n\nQuba is one of the popular regions of Azerbaijan. In the past, the guests visiting Azerbaijan were invited to visit Quba because of its proximity to the capital city. Lezgins, Tats, Khinalug people, Budukh people and Kryts people were living in peace and friendship with Turks in Quba for centuries. Qırmızı, being located in Quba where the mountain Jews reside, is also important in promoting Quba.\n\nOfficially, Jews were registered with 213,138 people in 34 settlements of the Caucuses in 1881. Over the past hundred years, along with highland Jews, other ethnolinguistic groups or the regions - Ashkenazi, Krymchaks, Kurdish Jews, and Georgian Jews also lived in Azerbaijan. However, since the 19th century, the majority of Jewish population of republic is consisting of mountainous Jews.\n\nThe first Jewish settlement in the area was named \"Kulgat\" on the left bank of the Gudjalchay, just a few kilometers from present day Qırmızı. The old grave stones in the Kulgat area and other evidences that partially had been destroyed during the attacks of the Nadir Shah proves that the Jews had lived here.\n\nWhile the highland Jews had been in the area around Quba since at least the 13th century, the formal creation of Krasnaya Sloboda is traced back to the 18th century. In 1742 the Khan of Quba, Fatali Khan, gave the Jews permission to set up a community free of persecution across the river from the city of Quba. Originally referred to as Yevreiskaya \"Sloboda\" (Jewish Settlement), the name was changed to Krasnaya Sloboda (Red Settlement) under Soviet rule.\n\nThe Jews who moved here from different places lived in 9 settlements. The Jews from Gilan moved to the settlement in the 1780. The Gilaki settlement of the Gilani Jews located in the center of the Red settlement. People coming from Baku and Quba lived in the settlement of Mizrahi (\"East\"). Migration from different locations influenced the diversity of employment. For example, Jews moving from mountainous regions were engaged in various agricultural fields, and people who immigrated from Iran were engaged in trade.\n\nThe massive settlement in the Red town began in 1731. After the death of Huseynali Khan in 1758, his son Fatali Khan was leader of Quba khanate. Khan highly appreciating the loyalty, wisdom, and industriousness of the mountain Jews, gave them a great opportunity for engaging in agriculture, gardening, trade, and crafts. Favorable living conditions created for Jews in Quba caused the relocation of Jews from other villages, such as Qusar, Ucgun, Shudukh, Griz, and even from Baku, Iran, Turkey and other places to Quba.\n\nFinally, mountain Jews who escaped attacks and persecutions joined the shelter of heading Husseinanli Khan in Quba. The Quba Khanate, which were developing during the years of Hussein Khan (1722-1758) and his son Fatali Khan (1758-1789), consist of the northern lands of Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan, from Derbent to Lankaran. Since 1722, mountain Jews have settled in the territory of Gudyalchay.\n\nAmong Russian Jews, the town once was known as \"little Jerusalem\". Located at the intersection of East and West, more than 40 minorities and ethnic groups live in Azerbaijan, including Talyshs, Avars, Lezgins, Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians, Poles and others.\n\nThe town has had an influx of financial support from relatives living in Israel and features the new Bet Knesset Synagogue. However, after Azerbaijan's independence in 1991, many residents emigrated to Israel, the United States, and Europe, and the population dropped from the roughly 18,000 that lived there during the era of Communism.\n\nThe Jewish residents continue their worship in the remaining synagogues. Only eight of the thirteen synagogues have been preserved in the settlement.\n\nTwo synagogues exist in Qırmızı Qəsəbə: \"Altı günbəz\" (Grand) synagogue which was built in 1888 and renovated in 2000, and \"Giləki\" (Hilaki) synagogue which was built in 1896 and renovated recently.\n\nSynagogues do not have a special call during worship. People come and pray because they know the time of worship. Morning worship begins at 8am. The afternoon worship comes at 8:00 p.m. and at 9:00 p.m. evening worship. Following tradition, women do not worship in the synagogue though may come to synagogues on holidays.\n\nResidents speak in 3 language: Judeo-Tat which mountain Jews speak in daily life, Russian and Azerbaijan language. The majority of residents of this settlement have also mastered English. One of the two schools here is taught in Azerbaijani or Russian.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10707911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10707911", "title": "Rua Kenana Hepetipa", "text": "Rua Kenana Hepetipa\n\nRua Tapunui Kenana (1869–1937) was a Māori prophet, faith healer and land rights activist. He called himself Te Mihaia Hou, the New Messiah, and claimed to be Te Kooti Arikirangi's successor Hepetipa (Hephzibah) who would reclaim Tūhoe land that had been lost to Pākehā ownership. Rua's beliefs split the Ringatū Church, which Te Kooti had founded in around 1866/1868. In 1907 Rua formed a non-violent religious community at Maungapōhatu, the sacred mountain of Ngāi Tūhoe, in the Urewera. By 1900, Maungapōhatu was one of the few areas that had not been investigated by the Native Land Court. The community, also known as New Jerusalem, included a farming co-operative and a savings bank. Many Pākehā believed the community was subversive and saw Rua as a disruptive influence.\n\nIn 1916 police mounted an armed expedition, arriving at Maungapōhatu on 2 April to arrest Rua for sedition. He was found not guilty on this charge but imprisoned for resisting arrest. Rua was released in April 1918 and returned to Maungapōhatu, the community was however in decline and by the early 1930s, most people had left to find work elsewhere. Rua moved on to Matahi in the eastern Bay of Plenty and lived there until his death in 1937.\n\nIn September 2017, the government committed to pardon him as part of a treaty settlement.\n\nRua was born in 1869 at Maungapōhatu in the Urewera Country New Zealand. He was the posthumous son of Kenana Tumoana, who was killed at Makaretu in November 1868 while fighting for Te Kooti, and of Ngahiwi Te Rihi. Rua was a member of the Tamakaimoana hapū of the Tūhoe tribe and, although not a chief in his own right, was of high birth and could trace his descent from Potiki and Toroa of the Mataatua canoe.\n\nIn 1887 Rua left Maungapōhatu to learn farming. He worked on sheep stations in the Gisborne and Bay of Plenty districts and was a member of a shearing gang on the East Coast. During this period he studied the Bible. In 1905 he returned to Maungapōhatu where he set himself up as a prophet of the New Testament type. Here he formed his new self-sufficient community at Maungapōhatu which he called the \"New Jerusalem\" with its eventual population of between 800–1000 followers.\n\nTe Kooti Arikirangi, the founder of the Ringatu religion, had predicted before he died that he would have successor. Rua's statement that he was the successor to Te Kooti was first announced through an experience that he underwent on Maungapōhatu, the sacred mountain of Tūhoe. The oral narratives tell how Rua and his first wife, Pinepine Te Rika, were directed to climb the mountain by a supernatural apparition, later revealed to be the archangel Gabriel. There they were shown a hidden diamond, the guardian-stone of the land, whose bright light was shielded by Te Kooti's shawl. Rua, in his turn, covered it again to protect it. In some versions of the narrative Rua met both Whaitiri, the ancestress of Tūhoe, and Christ on the mountain. Rua would soon claim to be the Māori brother of Christ.\n\nThe first of three periods of settlement at Maungapōhatu, Rua arrived at this isolated outpost as the winter set in. Those who were there can still remember the harshness of that first year: the potato crop failed and there were no pigs to be had. Tatu, one of the Riwaiti, had to go back to Te Whaiti to collect 6 sows to start their own breeding colony. At least 50 people died that winter, most of them children, from the inadequacy of the houses, an outbreak of typhoid which came from the valley camps, and a measles epidemic which devastated the community. Sometimes there was nothing to eat but huhu, and the coarse toi leaves, normally used only for clothing. But from this inauspicious beginning, the community struggled on to a first summer of great plenty. Two groups had come together to build ‘te pa tapu o te atua’, the sacred pā of the Lord, the Tūhoe, about half the entire tribe, and the Whakatohea, who through confiscation were almost landless. To signify the union between these two Mataatua tribes, Rua constructed the house of the Lord, Hiruharama Hou, built with two gables. One side was for Tūhoe and the other for Whakatohea.\nRua claimed to be the new Christ, the son of Jehovah, and said that no one who joined him would die. He called himself Te Mihaia Hou, the New Messiah. Rua owed his power to the great skill with which he applied the scriptures to the day today events in the lives of those who believed in him. His prophetic sayings (nga kupu whakari) gave meaning to a harsh existence, and offered hope to the future. He attempted to create a new system of land ownership and land usage. He organised a strong communal basis in all the settlements he founded but also emphasised the concept of family ownership of property. He cast aside all traditional Māori tapu practices and replaced them with new forms specifically associated with the faith in himself as the Promised Messiah. His followers vested their lands in Rua and he had these surveyed and sold back to them. The settlement was administered by the prophet's own parliament. He also formed a Māori mining company to exploit the mineral resources of the Urewera. At the prophet's command, 5 miles of forest were cleared and a prosperous farming community grew up under his leadership. Rua acted as his people's banker and took tithes of all they earned. In return, he gave them a prosperity they had never before known.\n\nRua built a curious two-storied circular temple of worship at Maungapōhatu , called the Hīona (Zion) that also became his parliament from where the community affairs were administered. This circular meeting house, built in 1908, was decorated with a design of blue clubs and yellow diamonds, and stood within the inner sanctum of the pa. This was Rua's “Council Chamber and Court House” – also known as “Rua's Temple”. Rua thought it was modelled on the Jerusalem Temple (even though his chamber was not to be a place of worship), but the actual model was the present day Dome of the Rock on Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a Muslim holy site and one of the most sacred of Islamic shrines. Its unique cylinder shape would make it one of a kind He grew his hair long and affected a bushy beard in the patriarchal tradition fashioned on the Jewish Nazirite. As his reading of the Bible appeared to prescribe seven wives, Rua kept to this number and immediately replaced any who died or ran away. In all he had 12 wives and over 70 children.\n\nFrom the King-ite tradition he inherited the idea that Māori possessed a separate nationality, and this, together with the success of his community, aroused the jealousy of local chiefs and incurred the Government's enmity. Through his personal vision his messianic religion promised the return of Māori lands and mana to Māori, and the end of their subjection to pākehā rule. He wanted to remove the Tūhoe people totally from European influence and induced many to sell all their stock and farming interests.\n\nBy 1908 Rua's struggle for power had brought the Tūhoe to the brink of civil war and the Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward intervened to curb the prophet's influence. The Government had organised a meeting in March 1908 at Ruatoki of all the Tūhoe tribes in an attempt to sort out the political differences between the two main Tūhoe factions, that of Rua Kenana and Numai Kereru, chief of the Ngatirongo and the main opponent among the Tūhoe of Rua's Christian-Judaic religious movement. Because conflict was expected, the New Zealand Prime Minister had decided to informally visit both parties before the conference. At a dramatic encounter with Sir Joseph Ward on the Whakatane beach front on 23 March 1908, Rua and Joseph Ward exchanged words. Rua, flanked by some of his wives and supporters while seated on a chair that had been borrowed from the pub, acknowledged Joseph Ward approaching. Ward addressed both parties publicly, asking for their assistance in reconciling the differences in the forthcoming meeting at Ruatoki. To Rua's followers Ward said that he could not accept all that Rua had asked for. In particular, his request for his supporters to be placed on the European electoral role (presumably because they were outnumbered in the Eastern Maori electorate) was unacceptable, for Māori have \"special representation of their own.” To Rua's request to have a special Māori government, he said, “I told Rua... that in New Zealand King Edward is king, and is represented here by his government or king. There can’t be two suns shining in the sky at the same time.” Rua replied to Ward, \"Yes, there is only one sun in the heavens, but it shines on one side – the Pākehā side – and it darkens on the other.”\n\nRua had become a political embarrassment, and there arose the need by the Government to make an example of this man widely seen as an agitator, hoping a crackdown would discourage other Māori activists. The mainstream Anglican church encouraged the Government to suppress Rua Kenana. In 1907, the church passed a motion that supported \"the recent action of the Government in the direction of the suppression of tohungism (traditional Māori healing), and trusts that it may be possible for the Church to make more aggressive action among the tribes which are specifically affected by this evil.\" Authorities saw Rua Kenana as a disruptive influence and targeted him with the Tohunga Suppression Act 1907, which banned traditional Māori healers from using herbs and other healing methods which were part of their traditional medicine. The Tohunga Suppression Act was designed to neutralise powerful traditional Māori leaders and tailor-made as a political weapon specifically against Rua Kenana and his movement of dissenting Māori.\n\nAs a result of a number of charges of obtaining alcohol in 1910, Rua was fined for sly grogging and, in 1915, served a short gaol sentence for a similar offence. On his release he resumed his sly grogging.\n\nRua insisted that his people boycott military service, pertaining it was immoral to fight for a Pākehā King and Country given the injustice meted out on Māori under the British crown. Rua said, \"I have 1400 men here and I am not going to let any of them enlist or go to war. You have no king now. The King of England he is no good. He is beat. The Germans will win. Any money I have I will give to the Germans. The English are no good. They have two laws. One for the Māori and one for the Pākehā. When the Germans win I am going to be king here. I will be king of the Māori and of the Pākehā.\" This was taken by the establishment as sedition and finally gave the Government and Rua's detractors the incentive to intervene against Kenana and the Maungapōhatu community.\n\nDuring the First World War the New Zealand Government had concerns that Rua opposed Tūhoe men enlisting for war, these concerns resulted in rumours that he openly supported Germany. The Government arrested Rua after a 1915 hahunga, a bone cleansing ceremony, where he allegedly supplied liquor without a licence. He was summoned to appear before a magistrate on 19 January 1916, Rua said he would appear at the February court session as he was busy harvesting cocksfoot grass but his non-appearance was deemed to be contempt of court and preparations began for an armed police expedition to arrest him.\n\nOn 2 April 1916 a 70-strong, and heavily armed, police party arrived at Maungapōhatu to arrest him for sedition. Because Rua's village was so remote, the police had to take a lot of equipment and camped on the way. They moved like a small army with wagons and pack-horses, and included \"New Zealand Herald\" photographer Arthur Breckon. So as not to alert the Maungapōhatu village of their intention to spring an attack they did not wear their police uniforms till just before the raid. They were convinced that when they reached Maungapōhatu there would be an ambush.\n\nThere was no violent resistance from Rua personally, but his supporters fought a brisk half-hour gun battle with the police in which two Māori, including Rua's son Toko, were killed and two wounded. Four constables were also wounded. Rua was arrested and transported to Rotorua, his hair and beard removed. From Rotorua, with six other Māori prisoners including Whatu, Rua was transferred to Auckland and sent directly to Mount Eden Prison. Rua was held, at first, on a nine months sentence imposed for the 1915 charges and now increased by his default of fines. After a trial on sedition which lasted 47 days, New Zealand's longest until 1977, he was found not guilty; but sentenced to one year's imprisonment for resisting the police.\nWhen he returned to the Urewera, the settlement at Maungapōhatu was broken, divided, and the lands overgrown and much of the community having relocated. The Presbyterian Mission under Rev. John Laughton had moved into Maungapōhatu and was teaching Presbyterian Christianity and Pākehā value systems. This shocked Rua, as he had banned pākehā schools from the original community. The costs of defence at the various trials had ruined the community financially as it had to sell stock and land to meet the debt. The community was even ordered to pay the costs of the entire police operations and raid at Maungapōhatu . Even though the supreme court had found Rua's arrest illegal and a legal petition had been drafted to Parliament on 1 May 1917 on behalf of the Maungapōhatu people calling for a full public inquiry into the events of 2 April 1916, and the behaviour of the police there and later intimidating witnesses, no compensation was ever offered to Maungapōhatu.\n\nEventually Rua moved downstream to Matahi, a community he had founded on the Waimana River in the eastern Bay of Plenty in 1910, where he lived until his death on 20 February 1937. He was survived by five wives, nine sons, and 13 daughters. Belief in his divinity did not long survive him, however, as he failed to fulfill his promise to rise from the dead. Little now remains of Maungapōhatu, and his church (Te Wairua Tapu) boasts few followers. The Urewera Country is peaceful, a contrast to what it was in the days of the Prophet Rua.\n\nIn September 2017, the government committed to pardon him as part of a treaty settlement.\n\n\n\n"}

A modern road by this name, part of the SS4 highway, runs from Rome to Osteria Nuova in Orvieto.\n\nThe Old Salt Route, about , was a medieval route in northern Germany, linking Lüneburg (in Lower Saxony) with the port of Lübeck (in Schleswig-Holstein), which required more salt than it could produce itself. Lüneburg, first mentioned in the 10th century, grew rich on the salterns surrounding the town. Traders shipped salt via Lauenburg, to Lübeck, which supplied all the coasts of the Baltic Sea. Lüneburg and its salt were major factors of power and wealth of the Hanseatic League. After a long period of prosperity, its importance declined after 1600. The last of the salt mines was closed in 1980, ending the thousand-year tradition.\n\nIn France, the salt route was longer than a portage between navigable streams. Salt unloaded at the ports of Nice and Ventimiglia could travel by two salt roads leading away from the coastal area, from Nice up the Vésubie valley, via Saint-Martin-Vésubie at the head of the valley, or from Ventimiglia inland through the Roya Valley, over the Col de Tende pass and into Piedmont.\nIn Ethiopia blocks of salt, called \"amoleh\", were carved from the salt pans of the Afar Depression, especially around Lake Afrera, then carried by camel west to Atsbi and Ficho in the highland, whence traders distributed them throughout the rest of Ethiopia, as far south as the Kingdom of Kaffa.\n\nBefore the People's Republic of China annexed Tibet and closed the borders in the 1950s, salt trade between Nepal and Tibet crossed passes through the Himalayas such as the gorges of the upper Karnali and Gandaki rivers. Caravans of pack animals brought rice up from Nepal's Terai and lower hills in exchange for salt from dry lakes on the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nThe salt highways of Europe were the navigable rivers, where by medieval times shipments of salt coming upstream passed rafts and log-trains of timber, which could only be shipped downstream. And even along Europe's coasts, once long-distance trade was revived in the 11th century, the hot and sunny south naturally outproduced the wet north. By the Late Middle Ages the expanding fishing fleets of the Low Countries required more salt than could be produced locally; the balance was made up with salt from the Iberian Peninsula: \"The United Provinces could have been brought to their knees if their supplies of salt had been blocked at the end of the sixteenth century. Spain did no more than dream of this,\" Fernand Braudel has written. In Ming China, salt as well as rice was shipped from south to north, along the Imperial Canal as far as Beijing.\n\nIn France, a major source of marine salt with access to expansive hinterlands in need of it was the wetlands region in Languedoc called the Camargue; from the salt pans called \"salines\", convoys of boatloads of salt could be carried up the Rhone to Seyssel where it had to be off-loaded and carried by mule train inland to the little village of Regonfle near Geneva, where it rejoined a waterway.\n\nOf the early modern period in Europe, Fernand Braudel remarked that in spite of the flux and reflux of economics:\n\"no salt mine was ever abandoned and the scale of the equipment needed put these mines in the hands of merchants from very early days. Salt-marshes on the other hand, were exploited by artisanal methods: the merchants took control only of transport and marketing, both in Setúbal in Portugal and in Peccais in Languedoc. Salt marketing was probably quite big business along the Atlantic seabord or the Rhône valley.\"\n\nThe vast interior of Poland was salt-starved, its maritime districts lying under rainy skies and fronting the Baltic Sea. By medieval times the process of mining for fossil salt supplemented the age-old techniques of evaporating sea salt in tidal pans. By the 14th century, at Wieliczka near Kraków, Braudel reports that peasant extraction of salt from brine evaporated in large shallow iron pans had been eliminated by the early industrialisation of salt mining. \"Galleries and shafts were now dug to a depth of 300 metres, and enormous winches powered by teams of horses brought blocks of salt to the surface. At its peak, production stood at 40,000 tons a year and the mines employed 3,000 workers. By 1368, the cooperation of the Polish state had been obtained.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "208369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208369", "title": "Thermoluminescence dating", "text": "Thermoluminescence dating\n\nThermoluminescence dating (TL) is the determination, by means of measuring the accumulated radiation dose, of the time elapsed since material containing crystalline minerals was either heated (lava, ceramics) or exposed to sunlight (sediments). As a crystalline material is heated during measurements, the process of thermoluminescence starts. Thermoluminescence emits a weak light signal that is proportional to the radiation dose absorbed by the material. It is a type of luminescence dating.\n\nThe technique has wide application, and is relatively cheap at some US$300–700 per object; ideally a number of samples are tested. Sediments are more expensive to date. The destruction of a relatively significant amount of sample material is necessary, which can be a limitation in the case of artworks. The heating must have taken the object above 500° C, which covers most ceramics, although very high-fired porcelain creates other difficulties. It will often work well with stones that have been heated by fire. The clay core of bronze sculptures made by lost wax casting can also be tested.\n\nDifferent materials vary considerably in their suitability for the technique, depending on several factors. Subsequent irradiation, for example if an x-ray is taken, can affect accuracy, as will the \"annual dose\" of radiation a buried object has received from the surrounding soil. Ideally this is assessed by measurements made at the precise findspot over a long period. For artworks, it may be sufficient to confirm whether a piece is broadly ancient or modern (that is, authentic or a fake), and this may be possible even if a precise date cannot be estimated.\n\nNatural crystalline materials contain imperfections: impurity ions, stress dislocations, and other phenomena that disturb the regularity of the electric field that holds the atoms in the crystalline lattice together. These imperfections lead to local humps and dips in the crystalline material's electric potential. Where there is a dip (a so-called \"electron trap\"), a free electron may be attracted and trapped.\n\nThe flux of ionizing radiation—both from cosmic radiation and from natural radioactivity—excites electrons from atoms in the crystal lattice into the conduction band where they can move freely. Most excited electrons will soon recombine with lattice ions, but some will be trapped, storing part of the energy of the radiation in the form of trapped electric charge (Figure 1).\n\nDepending on the depth of the traps (the energy required to free an electron from them) the storage time of trapped electrons will vary as \"some traps are sufficiently deep to store charge for hundreds of thousands of years\".\n\nIn thermoluminescence dating, these long-term traps are used to determine the age of materials: When irradiated crystalline material is again heated or exposed to strong light, the trapped electrons are given sufficient energy to escape. In the process of recombining with a lattice ion, they lose energy and emit photons (light quanta), detectable in the laboratory.\n\nThe amount of light produced is proportional to the number of trapped electrons that have been freed which is in turn proportional to the radiation dose accumulated. In order to relate the signal (the thermoluminescence—light produced when the material is heated) to the radiation dose that caused it, it is necessary to calibrate the material with known doses of radiation since the density of traps is highly variable.\n\nThermoluminescence dating presupposes a \"zeroing\" event in the history of the material, either heating (in the case of pottery or lava) or exposure to sunlight (in the case of sediments), that removes the pre-existing trapped electrons. Therefore, at that point the thermoluminescence signal is zero.\n\nAs time goes on, the ionizing radiation field around the material causes the trapped electrons to accumulate (Figure 2). In the laboratory, the accumulated radiation dose can be measured, but this by itself is insufficient to determine the time since the zeroing event.\n\nThe \"Radiation Dose Rate\" - the dose accumulated per year-must be determined first. This is commonly done by measurement of the alpha radioactivity (the uranium and thorium content) and the potassium content (K-40 is a beta and gamma emitter) of the sample material.\n\nOften the gamma radiation field at the position of the sample material is measured, or it may be calculated from the alpha radioactivity and potassium content of the sample environment, and the cosmic ray dose is added in. Once all components of the radiation field are determined, the accumulated dose from the thermoluminescence measurements is divided by the dose accumulating each year, to obtain the years since the zeroing event.\n\nThermoluminescence dating is used for material where radiocarbon dating is not available, like sediments. Its use is now common in the authentication of old ceramic wares, for which it gives the approximate date of the last firing. An example of this can be seen in Rink and Bartoll, 2005.\n\nThermoluminescence dating was modified for use as a \"passive sand migration analysis tool\" by Keizars, \"et al.\", 2008 (Figure 3), demonstrating the direct consequences resulting from the improper replenishment of starving beaches using fine sands, as well as providing a \"passive\" method of policing sand replenishment and observing riverine or other sand inputs along shorelines (Figure 4).\n\nOptically stimulated luminescence dating is a related measurement method which replaces heating with exposure to intense light. The sample material is illuminated with a very bright source of green or blue light (for quartz) or infrared light (for potassium feldspars). Ultraviolet light emitted by the sample is detected for measurement.\n\n\n\n"}

The Greek language also underwent a vowel shift near the beginning of the Common Era, which included iotacism. Among the Semitic languages, the Canaanite languages underwent a shift in which Proto-Semitic *ā became ō in Proto-Canaanite (a language likely very similar to Biblical Hebrew).\n\nA vowel shift can involve a merger of two previously different sounds, or it can be a chain shift.\n\nOne of the several major vowel shifts that is currently underway in the US is the Northern Cities Vowel Shift. This change pattern is characterized by the longer and lower vowels moving forward and upward, while the shorter vowels move downward and backward. This vowel rotation, for example, is noticeable as the vowel sound in “coffee” is moving toward the vowel in “father.” While there are undoubtedly several other change patterns that define the shift in the Northern Cities, they are diffusing throughout the North in a unique manner, and are inherently different from dialect shifts taking place in other regions.\n\nIn addition to the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, the dialect change patterns that are taking place in the South also indicate undeniable pronunciation changes in the region. In contrast to the changes in the North, however, the Southern Cities Vowel Shift is characterized by the shorter, front vowels moving upward and adopting the characteristics of traditionally longer vowels. To exemplify this Southern vowel change, the vowel in the word “bed” is commonly used, as the “e” moves upward and gains a glide and causes the word to be pronounced more like “bayd.”\n\n\nWolfram, Walt and Natalie Schilling-Estes.

He was assassinated in 1980.\n\nBorn into a working-class family in Georgetown in the then British Guiana (now Guyana), Walter Rodney was a bright student, attending Queen's College, where he became a champion debater and athlete, and then attending university on a scholarship at the University College of the West Indies (UCWI) in Jamaica, graduating in 1963 with a first-class degree in History, thereby winning the Faculty of Arts prize.\n\nRodney earned a PhD in African History in 1966 at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, England, at the age of 24. His dissertation, which focused on the slave trade on the Upper Guinea Coast, was published by the Oxford University Press in 1970 under the title \"A History of the Upper Guinea Coast 1545-1800\" and was widely acclaimed for its originality in challenging the conventional wisdom on the topic.\n\nRodney traveled widely and became very well known internationally as an activist, scholar and formidable orator. He taught at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania during the period 1966-67 and later in Jamaica at his alma mater University of the West Indies in Mona. He was sharply critical of the middle class for its role in the post-independence Caribbean. He was also a strong critic of capitalism and argued for a socialist development template.\n\nOn 15 October 1968 the government of Jamaica, led by prime minister Hugh Shearer, declared Rodney \"persona non grata\". The decision to ban him from ever returning to Jamaica and his subsequent dismissal by the University of the West Indies, Mona caused protests by students and the poor of West Kingston which escalated into a riot, known as the Rodney Riots, resulting in six deaths and causing millions of dollars in damages. The riots which started on 16 October 1968 triggered an increase in political awareness across the Caribbean, especially among the Afrocentric Rastafarian sector of Jamaica, documented in Rodney's book \"The Groundings with my Brothers\" published by Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications in 1969.\n\nIn 1969, Rodney returned to the University of Dar es Salaam, where he served as a Professor of History until 1974.\n\nRodney became a prominent Pan-Africanist, and was important in the Black Power movement in the Caribbean and North America. While living in Dar es Salaam he was influential in developing a new centre of African learning and discussion.\n\nIn 1974 Rodney returned to Guyana from Tanzania. He was due to take up a position as a professor at the University of Guyana but the Guyanese government prevented his appointment. Increasingly active in politics, he founded the Working People's Alliance, a party that provided the most effective and credible opposition to the PNC government. In 1979 he was arrested and charged with arson after two government offices were burned.\n\nOn 13 June 1980, Rodney was killed in Georgetown, at the age of thirty-eight, by a bomb in his car, a month after returning from celebrations during the independence in Zimbabwe in a time of intense political activism. He was survived by his wife, Patricia, and three children. His brother, Donald Rodney, who was injured in the explosion, said that a sergeant in the Guyana Defence Force, named Gregory Smith, had given Walter the bomb that killed him. After the killing Smith fled to French Guiana, where he died in 2002.\n\nIt is widely believed, but not proven, that the assassination was set up by then-President Linden Forbes Burnham. Rodney believed that the various ethnic groups that had been historically disenfranchised by the ruling colonial class should work together, which was in conflict with Burnham.\n\nIn early 2015, a Commission of Inquiry (COI) was held during which a new witness, Holland Gregory Yearwood, came forward claiming to be a longstanding friend of Rodney and a former member of the WPA. Yearwood testified that Rodney presented detonators to him weeks prior to the explosion asking for assistance in assembling a bomb.\n\nRodney's most influential book was \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa\", published in 1972. In it he described an Africa that had been consciously exploited by European imperialists, leading directly to the modern underdevelopment of most of the continent. The book became enormously influential as well as controversial: it was groundbreaking in that it was among the first to bring a new perspective to the question of underdevelopment in Africa. Rodney's analysis went far beyond the previously accepted approach in the study of Third World underdevelopment.\n\n\"Instead of being interested primarily in the inter-relations of African trade and politics, as many of us were at that time, Walter Rodney focused his attention on the agricultural basis of African communities, on the productive forces within them and on the processes of social differentiation. As a result, his research raised a whole set of fresh questions concerning the nature of African social institutions on the Upper Guinea coast in the sixteenth century and of the impact of the Atlantic slave trade. In doing so, he helped to open up a new dimension. Almost immediately he stimulated much further writing and research on West Africa, and he initiated a debate, which still continues and now extends across the whole range of African history.When teaching at the Universities of Dar es Salaam and the West Indies, he launched and sustained a large number of discussion groups which swept up and embraced many who had had little or no formal education. As a writer, he reached out to contact thousands in \"The Groundings with my Brothers\" (1969) and in his influential \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa\" (1972).\" — Remarks by Professor John Richard Gray, \"History Today\", Vol. 49, Issue 9, 1980.\"When we think of Walter Rodney as a Revolutionary Scholar we are talking about two things, Radical Scholar and his revolutionary contribution to the study of History ie. History of Africa. Walter Rodney was a pioneering scholar who provided new answers to old questions and posed new questions in relation to the study of Africa.\" — Remarks by Professor Winston McGowan at the Walter Rodney Commemorative Symposium held at York College, USA, in June 2010.\n\n\"Walter Rodney was no captive intellectual playing to the gallery of local or international radicalism. He was clearly one of the most solidly ideologically situated intellectuals ever to look colonialism and its contemporary heir black opportunism and exploitation in the eye\" — Remarks by Wole Soyinka, Oduduwa Hall, University of Ife, Nigeria, Friday, 27 June 1980.\n\nRodney's community-grounded approach to mass education during the 1960s and his detailed descriptions of his pedagogical approach in \"Groundings\" (1969) document his role as an important critical pedagogue and contemporary of Paulo Freire.\n\n\nRodney's death was commemorated in a poem by Martin Carter entitled \"For Walter Rodney,\" by the dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson in \"Reggae fi Radni,\" and by Kamau Brathwaite in his poem \"Poem for Walter Rodney\" (\"Elegguas,\" 2010).\n\nIn 1977, the African Studies Centre, Boston University, inaugurated the Walter Rodney Lecture Series.\n\nIn 1982, the American Historical Association posthumously awarded Walter Rodney the Albert J. Beveridge Award for \"A History of the Guyanese Working People, 1881-1905\".\n\nIn 1984, the Centre for Caribbean Studies of the University of Warwick established the Walter Rodney Memorial Lecture in recognition of the life and work of one of the most outstanding scholar-activists of the Black Diaspora in the post-World War II era.\n\nIn 1993, the Guyanese government posthumously awarded Walter Rodney Guyana's highest honour, the Order of Excellence of Guyana. The Guyanese government also established the Walter Rodney Chair in History at the University of Guyana.\n\nIn 1998, the Institute of Caribbean Studies, University of the West Indies, inaugurated the Walter Rodney Lecture Series.\n\nIn 2004, Rodney's widow Patricia and his children donated his papers to the Robert L. Woodruff Library of the Atlanta University Center. Since 2004, an annual Walter Rodney Symposium has been held each 23 March (Rodney's birthday) at the Center under the sponsorship of the Library and the Political Science Department of Clark Atlanta University, and under the patronage of the Rodney family.\n\nIn 2005, the London Borough of Southwark erected a plaque in the Peckham Library Square in commemoration of Dr. Walter Rodney, the political activist, historian and global freedom fighter.\n\nIn 2006, an International Conference on Walter Rodney was held at the Institute of Development Studies of the University of Dar es Salaam.\n\nIn 2006, the Walter Rodney Essay Competition was established at the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan\n\nIn 2010, the Walter Rodney Commemorative Symposium was held at York College\n\nThe Department of African American Studies at Syracuse University established the Angela Davis/Walter Rodney Award of Academic Achievement.\n\nThe Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS) at the University of Michigan established the DuBois-Mandela-Rodney Post-doctoral Fellowship Program\n\nIn 2012, the Walter Rodney Conference celebrating the 40th anniversary of the publication of \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa\" was held at Binghamton University.\n\nRodney is the subject of the 2010 documentary film by Clairmont Chung, \"W.A.R. Stories: Walter Anthony Rodney\".\n\nThe Walter Rodney Close in the London Borough of Newham has been named in honor of Rodney.\n\nWalter Rodney is listed on the Black Achievers Wall in the International Slavery Museum, Liverpool, UK.\n\n\n\n"}

The distinguished Teacher of the Republic of Dagestan and the Russian Federation.\n\nYagutil Mishiev was born on March 29, 1927 in Qırmızı Qəsəbə (English: Red Town - a village and municipality in the Quba Rayon of Azerbaijan, USSR). In 1943 he finished school because of the need for teachers and was sent to complete teachers courses. In that same year, in September, at 16 years old, he started teaching in school. In 1944, he completed a diploma program using methods of distance learning with a degree from The Kuban Pedagogical College, Kuba, Azerbaijan. In 1945, while working at a school, he started a math degree at the Kuban Pedagogical Institute. In 1947, he attained a diploma of a teacher of physics and mathematics.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1951, he actively helped the board of the municipality of Kuba, Azerbaijan to prepare documents to award a medal to those who worked on the labor front of World War II. The medal is called \"Doblisneye Trud\", valiant work during World War II from 1941–1945. In 1946, he was asked by the head of the Kuba military enlistment office to complete a census of veterans in order to be able to award them the medal entitled \"For the Victory Over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945\". In 1951, the Mishiev family moved to Derbent, a city in the Dagestan Republic of Russia. From 1954, Yagutil Mishiev worked as a teacher of mathematics in \"The School for Working Youth\", also titled School №1. In 1963, he got a master's degree of a math teacher from Dagestan State University. For many years, Mishiev worked as the director of the Museum of Regional Studies. Mishiev also collected unique materials of the history of the city. From 1976 to 1991, Mishiev worked as the principal of School №11 in Derbent. From 1991 to 1997, Yagutil Israelovich Mishiev worked as a chief specialist in the City Department of Education.\n\nSince 1997, Mishiev resides in Rishon Letzion, Israel. In Israel, Mishiev has written several books about the history and the historical architectural monuments of the city of Derbent. His titles include \"A Long Road of 5000 Years\" and \"Derbent and World Civilization\". Also, he wrote a \"Russian-English Dictionary of Mathematical Terms\". That work was written for pupils, students, teachers and parents. A book \"Our Roots\", Mishiev wrote a record of his family and their doings. His latest book, \"Only memory does not get old\" was devoted to the history of Jewish civilization.\n\nIn 1952, the Commission of the Ministry of Culture of Russia ordered the closure of the museum of regional studies because the exhibits did not meet the minimum requirements for a particular historical period as laid out by the Ministry for a museum. Recommendations were made for certain changes, after which the museum could reopen. It was necessary for new leadership of the museum. The Department of Culture of the city of Derbent sent Mishiev to work on the museum. Mishiev started to create a new exposition. In 1953, the museum was able to re-open. Working for years in the museum, Mishiev traveled around the Derbent District to collect unique materials and information about the history of the city. He studied the archives of the city of Derbent as well as the Azerbaijan State Museum of History in Baku and also in The Regional Museum of Dagestan in Makhachkala. Soon, scholars of Dagestan, the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences started to inquire on various issues related to the museum. In the second half the 50s, the museum started to promote the history of the historic city of Derbent and educate people about it. Mishiev conducted lectures and regularly appeared in the pages of the city’s newspaper titled \"Znamya Kommunizma\", (The Banner of Communism) as well as in the regional newspaper titled Leninchi, written in the Azerbaijani language. The museum work that started in 1952 became a part of his life.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49262302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49262302", "title": "Zlatko Hasanbegović", "text": "Zlatko Hasanbegović\n\nZlatko Hasanbegović (; born 14 June 1973) is a Croatian historian and politician who has served as a member of the Croatian Parliament since 2016. He served as Minister of Culture in the Cabinet of Tihomir Orešković from 22 January to 19 October 2016. Hasanbegović is also a member of the Zagreb Assembly and one of the founders of the Independents for Croatia party.\n\nAs a historian, Hasanbegović's interests are relations between the modern Croatian ideologies, especially \"pravaštvo\" (Croatian nationalist ideology) and its relations towards Islam in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 19th and 20th centuries. He researches Muslim elements of the Croatian bourgeois culture until 1945 and relations of political parties as well as religious and national relations in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the Austrian-Hungarian occupation until the communist takeover. He was an associate of the Institute of Humanities Ivo Pilar.\n\nZlatko Hasanbegović was born on 14 June 1973 in Zagreb to Zumreta Hasanbegović (née Prohić) from Gračanica and Ibrahim Hasanbegović from Bosanska Gradiška. His mother's side of the family moved from Gračanica (modern day Bosnia and Herzegovina) to the Croatian capital of Zagreb in 1941. His maternal grandfather, Sabrija Prohić, was a rich industrialist with properties across the former Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During World War II, the Prohić family helped hide a Jewish girl from Gračanica in their house in Zagreb. Hasanbegović's grandparents Sabrija and Safeta Prohić, along with his aunt and uncle Esma and Avdo Prohić, were posthumously named \"Righteous among the Nations\" by Israel in 2018. Hasanbegović was forbidden from attending the award ceremony.\n\nAfter the war, they were accused for smuggling foreign currency and arrested by the Communists. Sabrija Prohić tried to escape to Argentina, but was caught and later killed as a \"class enemy\", while their entire property was confiscated.\n\nHasanbegović finished elementary and high school in Zagreb, after which he enrolled in Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences where he graduated in history. He gained his doctorate on the same Faculty in 2009 in the field of history under supervisory of Ivo Goldstein.\n\nHasanbegović is working as a research associate at the Ivo Pilar Institute of Social Sciences. He is the editor of \"Pilar\" journal, member of executive committee of the Majlis of Zagreb's Muslim community,\n\nHe is president of the Supervisory Board of the Honorary Bleiburg Platoon, an organisation which is the main organizer of the commemoration for Bleiburg repatriations, and associate of various initiatives for the determination of victims of communist terror. The subject of his interest is the relation of modern Croatian national ideology, in particular the Party of Rights and its present-day offshoots, Islam in Croatia and Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 19th and 20th centuries. Hasanbegović researched the Muslim component of Croatian bourgeois culture until 1945 and the political and religious-ethnic relations in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the 1878 Austro-Hungarian rule until the communist takeover in the 1940s.\n\nHasanbegović has published Croatian translations of several essays: \"Against Democracy and Equality: The European New Right\" by Tomislav Sunić, \"The Holocaust Industry\" by Norman Finkelstein, \"Intellectual Terrorism\" by Jure Vujić, \"Communism and Nazism\" by Alain de Benoist, and \"Wahhabism\" by Hamid Algar.\n\nHe entered politics in his youth when he was a member of the Croatian Pure Party of Rights (HČSP). In 2015 he joined the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). On 8 May 2015 during the \"Otvoreno\" show on Croatian Radiotelevision Hasanbegović stated that anti-fascism is not in the foundations of the Croatian Constitution; \"Croatian War of Independence is the only war in the 20th century from which Croats came out as true winners and the only basis on which Croatia should be built. Ghosts and goblins of the past will cause a permanent rift and endless debate. Anti-fascism is not the foundation of Croatia, but a platitude that has no basis in the constitutional text, not being mentioned anywhere.\"\n\nDeputy Parliament Speaker and professor of constitutional law Robert Podolnjak from the governing Bridge of Independent Lists party, among many others, posited that anti-fascism is founded in the Croatian Constitution.\n\nHasanbegović said that his remarks about anti-fascism were related to the Yugoslav totalitarian legacy and Titoism: \"All who abuse the notion of anti-fascism, which can be fluid, as is well-known to historians, know that various meanings can be attributed to that notion. Stalin, Tito, Pol Pot and also U.S. General Patton were anti-fascists. Everyone knows that those were different persons. We are not talking about abstract anti-fascism but about the particular Yugoslav Communist totalitarian legacy.\"\n\nOn 22 January 2016, Hasanbegović was appointed as Minister of Culture by Prime Minister Tihomir Orešković. A part of the cultural workers expressed their dissatisfaction mainly due to his comments about anti-fascism and his lack of experience in management of culture. Civic initiative \"Platform 112\", which brings together 70 NGOs, held a protest in front of the Parliament on the day when the new Government was approved, urging MPs to vote against the Cabinet of Tihomir Orešković because of Hasanbegović. The Croatian Journalists' Association issued a statement in which they strongly opposed the nomination of Hasanbegovic as Minister of Culture.\n\nThe Israel-based Simon Wiesenthal Center urged the Croatian government to dismiss Hasanbegović, saying he took a disdainful attitude towards Croatian resistance to fascism during World War Two. The Croatian Helsinki Committee (HHO) and the \"Initiative EU 1481\" of \"Matica hrvatska\" dismissed the accusations against Hasanbegović as unfounded. Hasanbegović stated that the protests against him were not supported by any facts but based on a selective use of his different statements.\n\nAs one of his first moves as minister, Hasanbegović announced that there is no need for the continuation of government funding of any non-profit media. The International and European Federations of Journalists joined their affiliates in Croatia, the HND and the Trade Union of Croatian Journalists (Sinoh) in condemning this decision, as well as the Hasanbegović's dissolution of the Expert Committee for non-profit media before the end of its mandate.\n\nUnder the new budget for 2016, the Croatian government stopped funding certain cultural projects and non-profit media, which Hasanbegović described as \"racket money\", adding that tax-payers' money will no longer be distributed in a non-transparent way for neither the left-wing nor right-wing media.\n\nIn May, he signed a cooperation deal with Hungary's Minister Zoltán Balog. At the 17th electoral convention of the HDZ, Hasanbegović was elected to the HDZ Presidency and received most votes.\n\nAfter Croatian Parliament supported motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Orešković, his whole Cabinet resigned while the Parliament dismissed itself which led to new election. On 2016 parliamentary election, Hasanbegović was elected to the Parliament as HDZ's candidate. In the aftermath, newly elected president of HDZ Andrej Plenković formed a new government with new culture minister being Nina Obuljen Koržinek and not Hasanbegović for which he expressed his dissatisfaction.\n\nIn May 2017, Hasanbegović decided to participate in the Zagreb local elections on the independent list of Bruna Esih, who ran against the official HDZ candidate. Hasanbegović also criticized the HDZ leader Andrej Plenković, saying that his path \"is wrong and leads to moral quagmire\". The HDZ soon announced that Hasanbegović was evicted from the party. The independent list won 8,23% of the vote in the local election and Hasanbegović became a member of the Zagreb Assembly. Following the elections, Hasanbegović and Esih formed a new political party, the Independents for Croatia. The new party formed a majority in the assembly with the incumbent mayor Milan Bandić, on condition that the name of Zagreb’s Marshal Tito Square was changed to Republic of Croatia Square.\n\nIn 1996, Hasanbegović wrote at least two articles in the magazine \"The Independent State of Croatia\", named after the fascist Independent State of Croatia (NDH), in which he glorified the Ustashe as heroes and martyrs. The magazine was edited by the far-right Croatian Liberation Movement (HOP) and Hasanbegović was described as a young HOP member in it. Commenting on his texts from 1996 twenty years later, Hasanbegović said that the crimes of the Ustashe were \"the biggest moral lapse\" of the Croatian people in their history, adding: \"Using totally peripheral statements I made as a student more than 20 years ago and taking them out of context is nothing but political manipulation\". He also denied that he was ever a member of the Croatian Liberation Movement.\n\nIn 1993, Hasanbegović posed for a photo in Split at an event of the 9th Battalion of the Croatian Defence Forces (HOS), the Croatian Party of Rights' paramilitary (1991-1992), wearing a cap with what is allegedly an Ustashe Militia badge. The photograph's resurfacing in 2016 and its circulation in the Croatian media caused major backlash. Hasanbegović denied he was wearing an Ustashe cap, claiming the photo had been manipulated and that he wore a black cap of the HOS. A similar or identical cap, with an Ustashe badge, was worn by some members of the 9th HOS Battalion during their gatherings in the 1990s.\n\n"}
{"id": "11099992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11099992", "title": "Čedomilj Mijatović", "text": "Čedomilj Mijatović\n\nČedomilj Mijatović (or Chedomille Mijatovich, also spelled Mijatovitch, Miyatovich and Miyatovitch. His first name was often abbreviated in his publications to Chedo or Cheda, , October 6/18, 1842 – May 14, 1932) was a Serbian statesman, economist, historian, writer, politician, diplomat and one of the leaders of the Progressive Party. He was six times minister of Finance in the Principality/Kingdom of Serbia, three time minister of foreign affairs and minister plenipotentiary in Serbia to the Court of St James's (1884–1885; 1895–1900, and 1902/1903), to Romania (1894), and the Ottoman Empire (1900). He is one of the most important liberals in history of Serbian politics. Mijatović's authority as a writer on Serbia is universally acknowledged, and he had contributed largely to the Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition (1875–1889) and Eleventh Edition (1911).\n\nHis father Milan (1805–1852) was a lawyer who came to Serbia from southern Austrian Empire and became a teacher of Latin, history and geography in Belgrade's First Gymnasium (Grammar School). However, Čedomilj Mijatović was primarily influenced by his mother, Rakila Kristina (1826–1901), who was of mixed Serbian-Spanish origin.\n\nMijatović studied a combination of economic courses and sciences in Munich, Zurich and Leipzig between 1863 and 1865 and completed his education by gaining experience from the National Bank of Austria and Kredit Anstalt in Vienna. During his studies in Germany he met his future British wife Elodie Lawton (1825–1908), previously a dedicated abolitionist in Boston, who influenced him significantly, and turned him into a devoted Anglophile. She was the first English-speaking female historian in Serbia and she published \"The History of Modern Serbia\" in 1872. Later she published a collection of Serbian folk short stories and a collection of Serbian epic poems.\n\nAt the age of 23 he became a professor at the Belgrade's Grande École, the highest educational institution in Serbia of that age. He taught political economy and wrote three very influential textbooks, two of which were based on Lorenz von Stein. In these works he demonstrated his affinity for liberal economy and influenced many later Serbian economists to take similar positions. As a professor he started campaigning in favour of building a railway through Serbia. He gained many supporters among merchants and educated men for this idea, but many opposed him in Serbia during this campaign. He was also the earliest critique of communist and socialist utopian ideas in Serbia. His translation of Henry Thomas Buckle's book \"History of Civilisation in England\", was published in Serbian in 1871 and influenced several generations of pro-Western Serbs.\n\nMiјatović's wife was a member of the Wesleyan Church and was able to imbue her husband with nonconformist religious devotion. However, he always remained faithful to the Serbian Orthodox Church but wanted to bring some religious zeal into it. That was not a very popular task in Serbia of his time. He found a collaborator in this endeavour in the person of a Belgrade priest Aleksa Ilić who established a religious monthly \"Hrishchanski Vesnik\" (\"Christian Messenger\", in Serbian Cyrillic: \"Хришћански весник\"), the first journal dedicated to religious revival in Serbia. A Scottish philanthropist Francis Mackenzie who settled in Belgrade helped this project materially and Miјatović remained one of the main contributors of the journal.\n\nHe was the most active and influential Serbian translator from English during the 19th century. The bibliography of his translations includes about a dozen titles. Most of them deal with religious topics. That was his effort to contribute to religious revival. His translations into Serbian include: sermons of well-known British preachers such as Dr. Charles Haddon Spurgeon, Canon Henry Parry Liddon and Dr. Macduff. He also translated John Bunyan's \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" and Dr. David Brown's \"Commentaries to the Gospels\".\n\nAt the age of thirty-one he was already Minister of Finance at the end of 1873. He started his career as a protégé of the leader of the subsequent Liberal Party, Jovan Ristić, but soon joined the club of so-called young conservatives who turned into a kind of the personal party of the Serbian ruler, Prince Milan Obrenović (Prince from 1868, and King from 1882 till 1889). In the Government of Jovan Marinović, from November 1873 till December 1874 he was Minister of Finance for the second time and in that capacity he was instrumental in bringing important reforms. He introduced the metric system to Serbia. Serbia joined the Latin Monetary Union and he baptised the new domestic currency, the \"dinar\", after mediaeval Serbian silver coins. He always considered his most important achievement in this government the law stipulating the amount of property that had to be left to peasants, and could not be confiscated to cover their debts. This minimal amount included peasant's house, a yoke of oxen, the plough, and five acres of land. He was elected for the third time as Minister of Finance in the Government of Danilo Stefanović (Stefanović) in 1875.\n\nThe group of young conservatives he joined established the newspaper \"Videlo\" and soon came to power in October 1880. In the Government of Milan Piroćanac, Mijatović got two tenures. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs for the fourth time and Minister of Finance. Being a close friend of the ruler and in control of the two key ministries he was considered by many diplomats as the most influential person of this Cabinet. Prince Milan used him for the most significant missions. The two decisions that shaped Serbia's history for many years were carried out by Mijatović.\nWhen modern political parties were created in Serbia, in 1881, the Progressive Party turned out to be the only of the three Serbian parties (the other two being the mostly pro-Russian Liberal Party and very pro-Russian Radical Party) that was ready to make an agreement with Austria-Hungary, which became the most influential country in Serbia after the Congress of Berlin in 1878. The ruler decided to open a new page in Serbian foreign policy and arranged that a secret convention should be signed with the Habsburg Monarchy. Mijatović was gradually entrusted by the ruler to complete this task and on June 28, 1881 he signed the Secret Convention by which Serbia got the diplomatic and political backing of the Habsburg Empire but abandoned her independence in the field of Foreign Policy. When the two other most prominent members of the Cabinet, Prime Minister Piroćanac and Home Minister Garašanin learned about the exact contents of the Convention they decided to resign but had to accept the new reality in the end. In return Mijatović had to resign his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs and kept only his tenure at the Ministry of Finance. His last act as Minister of Foreign Affairs was to sign a Consular Convention and a Commercial Agreement with the United States of America on October 14. 1881. During talks that preceded the signing of the Secret Convention Mijatović was well received in Vienna by the Emperor Francis Joseph and other dignitaries of the Empire. The Emperor later decorated him with the first class of the Order of the Iron Crown, which entitled its bearer to become Austro-Hungarian count. Serbian citizens were banned by the Serbian constitution to accept any nobility titles. It is not clear if Mijatović ever officially submitted application to become an Austro-Hungarian count, yet he used this title openly since 1915, being the only Serb from the Kingdom of Serbia who did it.\n\nAs the Minister of Finance Mijatović had to secure Serbia's commitments from the Berlin Treaty by which she undertook to build the part of the Vienna-Constantinople railway line that went through Serbia. Since Serbia could not finance the project herself a proper foreign creditor had to be found and a Parisian financial society called Union Général was selected in 1881. Unfortunately it faced bankruptcy as soon as the beginning of 1882, which brought the already shaky state of Serbian finances very close to complete disaster. Learning of the bankruptcy Mijatović urgently travelled to Paris and there supported by Austro-Hungarian diplomacy found a way out. Another financial house Comptoir National D'Escompte took on the projects without detriment to Serbia. In spite of this success the reputation of Mijatović's party suffered a serious blow and never recovered. It turned out that the agents of the Union Général in Belgrade had tried to bribe many MPs and politicians and the reputation of the Progressivists suffered the most from this. He took personal part in preparing a law on the establishment of the National Bank of Serbia that was passed by the Serbian Parliament in January 1883. He advocated establishment of such institution long before and had an opportunity to establish it during his tenure. The Government of the Progressivists resigned in October 1883.\n\nBeing a lonely Serbian Anglophile Mijatović wished to be appointed as the first Serbian Minister in London, but had to wait until October 1884 when he became the second Serbian Minister at the Court of St James's. During this tenure he came into contact with many influential persons but his diplomatic post in London soon ended since he was appointed to be the sole Serbian negotiator in Bucharest where peace negotiations were scheduled following the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Serbia attacked Bulgaria on November 14, 1885 and within two weeks suffered a humiliating defeat. It was thanks to the Secret Convention signed with Austria-Hungary that Serbia was able to get out of the war without suffering more serious consequences. In Bucharest Miyatović and the Bulgarian representative Ivan Evstratiev Geshov concluded, on March 3, 1886, one of the shortest treaties in diplomatic history with one article only: „Article seul et unique. – L’état de paix qui a cessé d’exister entre le Royaume de Serbie et le Principauté du Bulgarie le 2–14 Novembre, 1885, est rétabli à partir de l’échange de ratification du present traité qui aura lieu à Bucharest.” Mijatović proved to be a peacemaker since he had ignored instructions from Belgrade that were prepared in such a way that he was supposed to find an excuse for new war. Apparently Mijatović was more worried about what sort of reputation he would have in England if negotiations failed than about criticism from Belgrade for his conciliatory approach.\n\nHaving returned from Bucharest Mijatović became for the fifth time Finance Minister in the Government of Milutin Garašanin in 1886/1887. Finally in 1887/1889 he was for the second time Foreign Minister in the Government of Nikola Hristić (Hristić). In this capacity he signed renewal of the Secret Convention. However, the decision of King Milan to abdicate on March 6, 1889 effectively ended his special position at the Court. The new government encouraged persecution of the members of the Progressive Party. Faced with all these failures he decided to leave Serbia and withdrew to Britain in September 1889.\n\nHe found refuge in London where he spent years between 1889 and 1894 and was committed to writing novels in Serbian based on gothic novels of Sir Walter Scott and historical works. Novels that he wrote in these years made him perhaps the most popular Serbian writer of his age. He added to his fame by publishing a book entitled \"On Conditions for Success\" [\"О условима успеха\"/\"O uslovima uspeha\"] in 1892 based on Samuel Smiles' bestseller \"Self-Help\". In Britain he became well known when he published a book on the last Byzantine Emperor. Owing to this book he was elected to be an honorary member of the Royal Historical Society, being the first Serb to attain such a distinction. Some time earlier he had become the second President of the Serbian Royal Academy, in 1888, but he resigned this post in 1889. It was in London, where Mijatović obtained introductions to the most celebrated writers in Britain, and became a contributor to the Encyclopædia Britannica.\n\nIn 1894 he returned from his self-exile to become Minister of Finance for the sixth and last time, but his tenure ended with the resignation of the whole Government after only two months in April 1894. He spent the rest of that year as a Serbian Minister in Bucharest but was recalled at the end of 1894. In April 1895 he got his favourite appointment. He became for the second time Serbian Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of St James's and kept this position until 1900. During this mandate he represented Serbia at the Hague Peace Conference in May–July 1899 where he advocated very progressive views, but both Aleksandar Obrenović and the Serbian Government did not share his enthusiasm for the instruments of international law and international arbitration. In 1900 he was put in the most important diplomatic place for Serbia. He became Serbian Minister in Constantinople but was recalled since he did not agree with the marriage of the Serbian King Alexander with a lady who was a commoner and a widow. He became Serbian senator in 1901 and stayed in London trying to establish a Serbian Commercial Agency. At the end of 1902 he was appointed for the third time to be Serbian Minister in London.\n\nIn the early morning of June 11, 1903 a conspiracy of Serbian officers killed King Alexander Obrenović and his unpopular wife Queen Draga. Having murdered them they threw their naked bodies out of window. The new government consisted of regicides and it appointed Petar Karađorđević to be new ruler of Serbia. The very event and composition of the new Cabinet caused widespread condemnation throughout Europe but only Britain and the Netherlands decided to break off diplomatic relations with Serbia. Mijatović was himself horrified and he was the only Serbian diplomat who resigned his post on June 22. This act was never forgiven to him by influential political circles in Belgrade.\n\nMijatović's name became known around the world thanks to a clairvoyant session that he attended together with a famous Victorian journalist William Thomas Stead. The result of the clairvoyant session that took place on the night of March 20, 1903, in Stead's opinion was that 'the bloody tragedy in the palace was seen clairvoyantly three months before it took place, and described in the hearing of at least a dozen credible witnesses'. Almost all the British dailies, as well as the American and continental press, commented on the prophecy. Later he was very much influenced by Stead and became a leading Serbian adherent of spiritism.\n\nAfter the May Coup Mijatović stayed in London until the end of his life. In 1908 he published his most popular book in English that went through three British and three American editions entitled Servia and the Servians. His reputation in Serbia after 1903 suffered greatly due to false rumours that he was implicated in a conspiracy to bring Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, beloved son of Queen Victoria, to the throne of Serbia. In 1911 he met King Peter Karageorgević in Paris and from this moment he was fully reconciled with the new regime in Serbia. Therefore, it is not surprising that he was considered as an unofficial member of the Serbian delegation in London during the London Conference in December 1912. Being a widower from 1908 he was considered as a favourite candidate of both the Serbian Government and the King to become the Archbishop of Skopje, which had two years earlier been incorporated to the Serbian state. But these efforts failed.\n\nHe became very active again at the beginning of the First World War. He wrote many letters and articles to British dailies but his most remarkable action in this field was his visit to the United States and Canada. He was accompanied by the most famous British suffragette, Emmeline Pankhurst, who championed the causes of Britain's small allies (Belgium and Serbia) during World War I. A visit to the United States of America and Canada with such a well-known person caused such a sensation, brought crowds to Mijatović's lectures, and enabled him to have well attended lectures and to give interviews to the leading dailies.\n\nHe died in London on May 14, 1932.\n\nHe published 19 books in Serbian, and 6 books in English: \"Constantine, the Last Emperor of the Greeks or the Conquest of Constantinople by the Turks (A.D. 1453)\", the first Serbian contribution to Byzantine history in English; after the \"Latest Historical Researches\" (London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company, 1892); Ancestors of the House of Orange (1892); \"A Royal Tragedy. Being the Story of the Assassination of King Alexander and Queen Draga of Servia\" (London: Eveleigh Nash, 1906); \"Servia and the Servians\" (London: Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, 1908); Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace, Prince Kropotkin, C. Mijatović, J. D. Bourchier, \"A Short History of Russia and the Balkan States\" (London: The Encyclopædia Britannica Company, 1914), and \"The Memoirs of a Balkan Diplomatist\" (London, New York, Toronto and Melbourne: Cassel and Co., 1917).\n\nHis book \"Servia and the Servians\" together with his entries on Serbia in the Tenth and Eleventh editions of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" served a very important purpose of offering a favourable view of Serbia to the Anglo-American public at the beginning of the twentieth century in a very turbulent and decisive period for Serbia. He was arguably among the first Serbs to contribute to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" and some of his entries were reproduced up until 1973. The other was Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch.\n\nHis long life in Britain made him a cultural bridge between two nations. His role in British-Serbian relations in unmatched in terms of his influence on mutual relations. Many British Balkan experts were aware of this and had a very high opinion of Mijatović. James David Bourchier, a correspondent of \"The Times\", remarked that \"he is generally regarded by his fellow-countrymen as the most learned man in Servia.\" William T. Stead, who met him during the Peace Conference in The Hague, was so delighted with him that he wrote: “It was almost worth while creating the Kingdom Servia if only to qualify Čedomilj Mijatovitch for a seat in the Parliament of the Nations.” Stead also had such a high opinion of Mijatović as a diplomat that in 1903 he remarked: “He is far and away the best known, the most distinguished, and the most respected diplomatist the Balkan Peninsula has yet produced.” The leading British daily \"The Times\" covered almost every step Mijatović took during the eighties, especially through its Vienna correspondents. There are almost 300 contemporary articles of \"The Times\" mentioning Mijatović. At no time before had any Serbian minister, or any Serb at all, enjoyed such sympathies from The Times as did Mijatović in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. When he resigned his tenure of the President of the Serbian Royal Academy The Times commented: “Of all the statesmen in Servia, M. Mijatovitch is probably the one who holds the highest character in foreign countries. He has filled the principal offices in Servia, not only those that are rewards for party services, by those conferred by public consent, if not by public acclamation, on men whose abilities are not judged by mere party conflicts.”\n\nHis whole working life was strongly influenced by the culture of Victorian Britain. In introducing Gothic novels into Serbian literature he was influenced by Sir Walter Scott. The inspiration for his religious pieces originated from Charles Haddon Spurgeon and Cannon Henry Parry Liddon. Even his policy was inspired by British statesmen, especially by William Ewart Gladstone and Lord Salisbury. In Britain he became familiar with spiritualism, a widespread habit during the Victorian era. Through the influence of William Thomas Stead and Sir Oliver Lodge he gradually became an ardent believer in spiritualism and supernatural phenomena. Another British influence came in the field of parliamentarianism. Mijatović wished to copy British budgetary debates but the Serbian parliament consisting mostly of peasant MPs did not quite understand this effort. Finally he wanted to transmit a Protestant vision of ethics of labour and capital as formulated in bestsellers of Samuel Smiles and in the works of some Presbyterians. For this reason he was called in a biography published on him in Serbian \"a Victorian among Serbs\".\n\n\nAdapted from Jovan Skerlić, \"Istorija nove srpske književnosti\" / History of Modern Serbian Literature (Belgrade, 1914) pages 339-342\n"}

In 1901, Orășanu graduated from the University of Bucharest's literature and philosophy faculty. The following year, he obtained a scholarship to study modern and contemporary history in Germany, but was unable to benefit from this due to the disease that would soon claim his life. From 1895, he was a clerk at the Romanian Academy Library. In 1900, he joined the editorial committee of \"Convorbiri Literare\" magazine. He substituted for Nicolae Iorga at Bucharest's history faculty in 1901. His contributions also appeared in \"Economia națională\", \"Epoca\", \"Liga literară\", \"Literatorul\", \"Noua revistă română\", \"Revista independentă\", \"Revista societății \"Tinerimea română\"\", \"Revista poporului\", \"România Literară\" and \"Românul literar\". He sometimes used the pen names Polit and Z. Miron.\n\nOrășanu wrote poetry, but most of his output consisted of studies on history and literary history, as well as reviews of theatre, music and fine arts. Several of these studies appeared in book form: \"Bibliografia cestiunii Orientului\", 1899; \"Cronicarii moldoveni din secolul al XVII-lea\", 1899; \"Istoria României contimporane. Note critice\", 1900; \"Botanica populară. Note critice\", 1900; \"Filosofia lui La Fontaine după d. Pompiliu Eliade. Note critice\", 1901.\n\nIn the latter book, he attacked the opinions of critic Pompiliu Eliade, ridiculing his notion that the form of Mihai Eminescu's poetry marked a \"considerable regression\" from that of Vasile Alecsandri. The author also took aim at Eliade's critical methodology, characterizing it as \"strikingly similar\" to what Jean-François de La Harpe was doing in the late 18th century, and noting that this approach had long been abandoned even in France. Orășanu went on to mock Eliade's observations about the length and phonetic structure of verses, and the diagrams he used for demonstration. After finding other \"errors\" and \"aberrations\", he concluded that Eliade had written \"a pastiche of a Parisian conference, in which cheap paradoxes give the illusion of originality\".\n\nTogether with Ioan Bianu, he prepared a Romanian edition of a book by Alexandre Maurice Blanc de Lanautte, Comte d'Hauterive; this appeared in 1902 as \"Memoriu asupra vechei și actualei stări a Moldovei prezentat lui Alexandru Vodă Ipsilante la 1787\".\n"}
