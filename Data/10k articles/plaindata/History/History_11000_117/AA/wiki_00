Violence across several states in northeastern Nigeria resulted in more than 1,000 dead, with around 700 killed in the city of Maiduguri alone, according to one military official.\n\nA government inquiry later found that, while long-standing tensions existed between Boko Haram and the Nigerian Security forces, the immediate cause of the violence stemmed from a confrontation between a group of sect members and police in the city of Maiduguri. The Boko Haram members were en route to bury a comrade at the cemetery. The officers, part of a special operation to suppress violence and rampant crime in Borno State, demanded that the young men comply with a law requiring motorcycle passengers to wear helmets. They refused and, in the confrontation that followed, police shot and wounded several of the men.\n\nAccording to initial media reports, the violence began on 26 July when Boko Haram launched an attack on a police station in Bauchi State. Clashes between militants and the Nigeria Police Force erupted in Kano, Yobe and Borno soon after. But President Umaru Yar’Adua disputed this version of events, claiming that government security forces had struck first. \n\n“I want to emphasize that this is not an inter-religious crisis and it is not the Taliban group that attacked the security agents first, no. It was as a result of a security information gathered on their intention ... to launch a major attack,\" he said.\n\nNigerian troops surrounded the home of Ustaz Mohammed Yusuf, the founder and spiritual leader of Boko Haram since 2002, in Maiduguri on 28 July after his followers had barricaded themselves inside. On July 30, the military captured Yusuf and transferred him to the custody of the police. They summarily executed him in public outside police headquarters. \n\n\"Islam Online\" suggests that politics, not religion, was the cause of the violence. People such as Christian pastor George Orjih were murdered specifically because they refused to convert to Islam.\n\nPrior to the clashes, many local Muslim leaders and at least one military official had warned the Nigerian authorities about the Boko Haram sect. Those warnings were reportedly ignored.\n\nOn 26 July, more than 50 people were killed and several dozen were injured in Bauchi when a gun-battle erupted as a police station was attacked by 70 Nigerian Boko Haram sect members who possessed grenades and guns. One government soldier and 32 Boko Haram militants were killed in the aftermath of the initial attack. The government claimed that 39 militants had been killed, and confirmed the death of a soldier. The attack was initiated by Boko Haram after their leaders were detained by the police. Security forces retaliated by raiding the neighbourhoods where the group was entrenched.\n\nIsa Yuguda, State Governor of Bauchi, commented: \"We have pre-empted the militants. Otherwise the situation would have been bad. I'm calling on all the people of Bauchi to be calm and be rest assured the situation has been brought under control.\"\n\nYuguda declared a night-time curfew, and the police maintained a visible profile. Businesses remained open in the area.\n\nIn July 2009, media reported that 100 bodies were found beside police headquarters in Maiduguri. Hundreds of people were leaving their homes to escape the violence. A jailbreak was reported but was not immediately confirmed. Several civilian corpses lay in the city's streets; witnesses said they had been shot after being pulled from their cars. The country's army and police were both on patrol and firing at suspects.\n\nOn 28 July, Army soldiers reportedly launched an offensive on the compound of sect leader Mohammed Yusuf and a nearby mosque used by his followers in the Borno state capital of Maiduguri. Troops shelled Mohammed Yusuf's home in the city after Yusuf's followers barricaded themselves inside. Shots rained across the city. O\n\nOn 30 July, Nigerian security forces killed 100 Boko Haram militants in fighting in Maiduguri. Security forces fought their way into a mosque occupied by militants, raking the interior with machine gun fire. Elsewhere, Military and Police forces engaged militants in house-to-house fighting. It was initially reported that Boko Haram vice-chairman Abubakar Shekau had been killed, but he was later reported alive. Nigerian policemen were also killed. After the government declared Maidguri to be secured, Nigerian forces began setting up mortar positions to shell the remaining enemy compound.\n\nOn 30 July, Yusuf was captured by the military and handed over to the police at the police headquarters in Maiduguri. Police officers summarily executed Yusuf inside the compound in full view of public onlookers. Police officials initially claimed that either Yusuf was shot while trying to escape or died of wounds sustained during a gun battle with the military. The police also executed other Boko Haram suspects, including Yusuf's father-in-law, outside the police headquarters. \n\nOn 2 August, a group of women and children abducted by Boko Haram were found locked in a house in Maiduguri. The military said a total of 700 people were killed in Maiduguri during the clashes. The Red Cross later said that it had taken 780 bodies from the streets of the city to be buried in mass graves.\n\nA gun-battle lasting several hours took place in Potiskum. Boko Haram militants set a police station on fire using fuel-laden motorcycles. It burned to the ground, and a police officer and a fire safety officer both were killed. Police engaged the fighters and wounded several. Police arrested 23 fighters after the battle. According to Nigerian sources, 43 Boko Haram fighters were killed in a shootout near the city on 30 July.\n\nThree people were killed in an attack in Wudil, and police forces made more than 33 arrests. Wudil's senior police officer was injured.\n\n\n"}

It purports to exhibit the deeds and discourses of Gregory, and has reached us in Armenian and in Greek. The text of this history has been considerably altered, but it has always been in high favor with the Armenians. Von Gutschmid maintains that the unknown author made use of a genuine life of St. Gregory, also of a history of his martyrdom and of that of Saint Rhipsime and her companions. Historical facts are intermingled in this life with legendary or uncertain additions, and the whole is woven into a certain unity by the narrator, who may have assumed his significant name from his quality of narrator of \"the good news\" of Armenia's conversion. It has been translated into several languages, and Greek and Latin translations are found in the \"Acta Sanctorum Bollandistarum\", tome viii.\n\nAccording to Agathangelos, he was tasked by Tiridates III to write about his father Khosrov II of Armenia and his reign period. Until the 19th century, based on this fact, scholars believe that Agatangelos lived in the 4th century.

{"id": "72581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72581", "title": "Arminius", "text": "Arminius\n\nArminius (; 18/17 BC – AD 21) was a chieftain of the Germanic Cherusci tribe who commanded an alliance of Germanic tribes at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, in which three Roman legions were destroyed.\nHis victory at Teutoburg Forest would precipitate the Roman Empire's permanent strategic withdrawal from Magna Germania, and made a major contribution to the eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire. Modern historians have regarded Arminius' victory as Rome's greatest defeat. As it prevented the Romanization of the Germanic peoples, Arminius' victory has also been considered one of the most decisive battles in history, and a turning point in world history. \n\nBorn a prince of the Cherusci tribe, Arminius was made a hostage of the Roman Empire as a child. Raised in Rome, he was drafted into the Roman military at an early age, during which he was granted Roman citizenship and became a Roman knight. After serving with distinction in the Great Illyrian Revolt, he was sent to Germania to aid the local governor Publius Quinctilius Varus in completing the Roman conquest of the Germanic tribes. While in this capacity, Arminius secretly prepared a Germanic revolt against Roman rule, which culminated in the ambush and destruction of three Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest Arminius fought off retaliatory invasions by the Roman general Germanicus in the battles of Pontes Longi, Idistaviso and the Angrivarian Wall, and deposed a rival, the Marcomanni king Maroboduus. Germanic nobles, afraid of Arminius' growing power, assassinated him in 21 AD. He was remembered in Germanic legends for generations afterwards. Roman historian Tacitus designated Arminius as the liberator of the Germanic tribes and commended him for having fought the Roman Empire to a standstill at the peak of its power. \n\nDuring the unification of Germany in the 19th century, Arminius was hailed by German nationalists as a symbol of German unity and freedom. Following World War II, however, Arminius was omitted from German textbooks due to his association with militaristic nationalism, and many modern Germans are unaware of his story. The 2000th anniversary of his victory was lightly commemorated in Germany, which has replaced traditional nationalism with \"an easy-going patriotism that mainly manifests itself at sporting events.\"\n\nThe etymology of the Latin name \"Arminius\" is unknown. Marcus Velleius Paterculus, in his \"Historiae\", mentions him as \"Arminius, the son of Sigimer, a prince of [the German] nation\" and states he \"attained the dignity of equestrian rank\". Due to Roman naming conventions of the time, it is likely \"Arminius\" is an adopted name granted to him upon citizenship, or otherwise not his Cheruscan name.\n\nThe origin of the use of the name \"Hermann\" dates from the 16th century, possibly first by Martin Luther. In German, Arminius is traditionally known as \"Hermann der Cherusker\" (\"Hermann the Cheruscan\") or \"Hermann der Cheruskerfürst\" (\"Hermann the Cheruscan Prince\"). Hermann etymologically means \"Man of War\", coming from the Old High German \"heri\" \"war\" and \"man\" \"man\".\n\nArminius, born in 18 or 17 BC in Germania, was son of the Cheruscan chief Segimerus (German: \"Segimer\"; Proto-Germanic: \"Sigimariz\"; Old English: \"Sigemaer\") and trained as a Roman military commander alongside his younger brother Flavus. He had lived in Rome as a hostage in his youth, where he had served in the Roman army between 1 and 6 AD, and had received a military education and obtained Roman citizenship as well as the status of equite before returning to Germania and driving the Romans out.\n\nAround the year AD 4, Arminius assumed command of a Cheruscan detachment of Roman auxiliary forces, probably while fighting in the Pannonian wars on the Balkan peninsula. He returned to northern Germania in AD 7 or 8, where the Roman Empire had established secure control of the territories just east of the Rhine, along the Lippe and Main rivers, and was now seeking to extend its hegemony eastward to the Weser and Elbe rivers, under Publius Quinctilius Varus, a high-ranking administrative official appointed by Augustus as governor. Arminius began plotting to unite various Germanic tribes to thwart Roman efforts to incorporate their lands into the empire. Between 6 and 9 AD, the Romans were forced to move eight of eleven legions present in Germania east of the Rhine river to crush a rebellion in the Balkans, leaving Varus with only three legions to face the Germans. Additional two legions, under the command of Lucius Nonius Asprenas were stationed in Moguntiacum. This represented the perfect opportunity for Arminius to defeat Varus.\n\nIn the autumn of AD 9, the 25-year-old Arminius brought to Varus a fake report of rebellion in northern Germany. He persuaded Varus to divert the three legions under his command (composed of the 17th, 18th and 19th legions, plus three cavalry detachments and six cohorts of auxiliaries) from the march to winter quarters to suppress the rebellion. Varus and his legions marched right into the trap that Arminius had set for them near Kalkriese, the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Arminius's tribe, the Cherusci, and their allies the Marsi, Chatti, Bructeri, Chauci, and Sicambri (five out of at least fifty Germanic tribes at the time) ambushed and annihilated Varus's entire army, totaling over 20,000 men. Recent archaeological finds show the long-debated location of the three-day battle was almost certainly near Kalkriese Hill, about 20 km north of Osnabrück. When defeat was certain, Varus committed suicide by falling on his sword. Arminius's success in destroying three entire legions and driving the Romans out of Germany was one of the most devastating defeats Rome suffered in its history, and a high point of Germanic power for centuries. Roman attempts to reconquer Germania failed although they managed to break Arminius's alliance.\n\nAfter the battle, the Germans quickly annihilated every trace of Roman presence east of the Rhine. Roman settlements such as the Waldgirmes Forum were abandoned. The vastly outnumbered Roman garrison of Aliso (modern day Haltern am See), under the command of the prefect Lucius Cedicius, inflicted heavy losses on the Germans before retreating into Gaul, resisting long enough for Lucius Nonius Asprenas to organize the Roman defense on the Rhine and Tiberius to arrive with a new army. This prevented Arminius from crossing the Rhine and invading Gaul.\n\nBetween 14 and 16 AD, Germanicus launched punitive operations into Germany, fighting Arminius to a draw in the Battle at Pontes Longi and twice defeating him (according to Tacitus): first in the Battle of Idistaviso and later at the Battle of the Angrivarian Wall. Arminius also faced opposition from his father-in-law and other pro-Roman Germanic leaders. In AD 15, Roman troops managed to recapture one of the three legionary eagles lost in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In AD 16, a second eagle was retrieved. Tiberius denied the request of Germanicus to launch an additional campaign for AD 17, however, having decided the frontier with Germania would stand at the Rhine river. Instead, he offered Germanicus the honor of a triumph for his two victories. The third Roman eagle was recovered in AD 41 by Publius Gabinius, under the emperor Claudius.\n\nWith the end of the Roman threat, a war broke out between Arminius and Marbod, king of the Marcomanni. It ended with Marbod fleeing to Ravenna and Roman protection, but Arminius failed to break into the \"natural fortification\" of Bohemia, and the war ended in stalemate.\n\nIn AD 19, Germanicus died in Antioch under circumstances which led many to believe he had been poisoned by his opponents. Arminius suffered death two years later, in AD 21, murdered by opponents within his own tribe who felt that he was becoming too powerful. Tiberius allegedly had refused an earlier offer from a Chatti nobleman to poison Arminius: \"It was not by secret treachery but openly and by arms that the people of Rome avenged themselves on their enemies.\"\n\nRoman attempts to reconquer Germany failed although the Romans inflicted several defeats on the Germans.\n\nArminius's victory against the Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest had a far-reaching effect on the subsequent history of both the ancient Germanic peoples and on the Roman Empire. The Romans were to make no more concerted attempts to conquer and permanently hold Germania beyond the river Rhine and the Agri Decumates. Modern historians have regarded Arminius's victory as \"Rome's greatest defeat\" and one of the most decisive battles in history. During the Unification of Germany in the 19th century, Arminius became hailed as a symbol of German unity and freedom.\n\nArminius had married a princess named Thusnelda, whose name is preserved only by Strabo. She was captured by the Romans while pregnant, so her son Thumelicus grew up in Roman captivity. Tacitus informs he had an unusual story, which the historian promises to tell, but it has been lost to us.\n\nIn the accounts of his Roman enemies, Arminius is highly regarded for his military leadership skills and as a defender of the liberty of his people. Based on these records, the story of Arminius was revived in the 16th century with the recovery of the histories of Tacitus, who wrote in his \"Annales II, 88\":\n\nArminius was not the only reason for Rome's change of policy towards Germania. Politics also played a factor; emperors could rarely trust a large army to a potential rival, though Augustus had enough family members to wage his wars. Also, Augustus, in his 30-year reign, had annexed many territories still at the beginning of the process of Romanization.\n\nTiberius, successor of Augustus, decided that Germania was a far less developed land, possessing few villages, with only a small food surplus, and therefore was not currently important to Rome. It would require a commitment too burdensome for the imperial finances and for excessive expenditure of military force for a new achievement.\n\nModern scholars have pointed out that the Rhine was a more practical boundary for the Roman Empire than any other river in Germania. Armies on the Rhine could be supplied from the Mediterranean sea via the Rhône, Saône and Mosel, with a brief area of portage. Armies on the Elbe, however, would have to have been supplied by extensive overland routes or by ships travelling the hazardous Atlantic. Economically, the Rhine already had towns and sizable villages at the time of the Gallic conquest. The Rhine was significantly more accessible from Rome and better equipped to supply sizeable garrisons than the regions beyond.\n\nRome would control Germania by appointing client kings, which was cheaper than military campaigns. Rome chose no longer to rule directly in Germania east of the Rhine and north of the Danube; Rome preferred to exert indirect influence through client kings, so Italicus, nephew of Arminius, was appointed king of the Cherusci; Vangio and Sido became vassal princes of the powerful Suebi, etc.\n\nIf indirect methods proved insufficient to control the Germanic tribes beyond the Rhine, Roman Emperors would lead devastating punitive campaigns deep into Germania. One of them, led by the Roman emperor Maximinus Thrax, resulted in a Roman victory in AD 235 at the Battle at the Harzhorn Hill, which is located in the modern German state of Lower Saxony, east of the Weser river, between the towns of Kalefeld and Bad Gandersheim.\n\nIn the early 19th century, attempts were made to show that the story of Arminius and his victory may have lived on in the Old Norse sagas, in the form of the dragon slayer Sigurd of the Völsunga saga and the Nibelungenlied. An Icelandic account\nstates that Sigurd \"slew the dragon\" in the Gnitaheidr—today the suburb Knetterheide of the city of Bad Salzuflen, located at a strategic site on the Werre river which could very well have been the point of departure of Varus's legions on their way to their doom in the Teutoburg Forest. Also one of the foremost Scandinavian scholars of the 19th century, Guðbrandur Vigfússon, identifies Sigurd as Arminius. This educated guess was also picked up by Otto Höfler, who was a prominent National Socialist academic in World War II.\n\nIn Germany, the name \"Arminius\" was interpreted as reflecting the name \"Hermann\"\nby Martin Luther, who saw Arminius as a symbol of the German people and their fight against Rome. \"Hermann der Cheruskerfürst\" became an emblem of the revival of German nationalism fueled by the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Klein/Käppel\">Dorothea Klein (ed.), Lutz Käppel (ed.): \"Das diskursive Erbe Europas: Antike und Antikerezeption\". Peter Lang, 2008, , p. 329</ref>\n\nIn 1838, construction was started on a massive statue of Arminius, known as the \"Hermannsdenkmal\", on a hill near Detmold in the Teutoburg Forest; it was finally completed and dedicated during the early years of the Second German Empire in the wake of the German victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. The monument has been a major tourist attraction ever since, as has The Hermann Heights Monument, a similar statue erected in New Ulm, Minnesota in the United States in 1897.\n\nThe Hermann Heights monument was erected by the Sons of Hermann, a fraternal organization formed by German Americans in New York City in 1840 and named for Hermann the Cheruscan that during the 19th century flourished in American cities with large populations of German origin. Hermann, Missouri, a town on the Missouri River founded in the 1830s and incorporated in 1845, was also named for Arminius.\n\nFollowing World War II Arminius became a less known figure among West Germans and many schools shunned away from teaching the subject in any detail due to its previous association with nationalism. There was, however, a somewhat different perception in East Germany than West Germany. In East Germany, Arminius, based on a marxist reading of history, came to be seen as a revolutionary figure of sorts, leading German tribes in a fight against the Roman slaveholder society (\"Sklavenhaltergesellschaft\"). In the context of the cold war Arminius became a symbol for socialism, with Rome being a symbol for the capitalist United States as an oppressive empire.\n\nThe 2,000 year anniversary of the battle was celebrated with restraint, avoiding \"flag-waving festivals\" and other gestures that might be interpreted as nationalism. According to \"Der Spiegel\": \"The old nationalism has been replaced by an easy-going patriotism that mainly manifests itself at sporting events like the soccer World Cup.\" The German Bundesliga football-club DSC Arminia Bielefeld is named after Arminius.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the 20th and 21st centuries, law in China inherits a large number of traditions. The core of modern Chinese law is based on Germanic-style civil law, socialist law, and traditional Chinese approaches.\n\nFor most of the history of China, its legal system has been based on the Confucian philosophy of social control through moral education, as well as the Legalist emphasis on codified law and criminal sanction. Following the Revolution of 1911, the Republic of China adopted a largely Western-style legal code in the civil law tradition (specifically German-influenced). The establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 brought with it a more Soviet-influenced system of socialist law. However, earlier traditions from Chinese history have retained their influence.\n\nLaw in the People's Republic of China is currently undergoing gradual reform, as many elements inside and outside the country emphasize the need to strengthen the rule of law in China, and international trade and globalization spur transformations in various areas of Chinese domestic law.\n\nThe word for law in classical Chinese was \"fǎ\" (法). The Chinese character for \"fǎ\" denotes a meaning of \"fair\", \"straight\" and \"just\", derived from its water radical (氵). It also carries the sense of \"standard, measurement, and model\". Derk Bodde and Clarence Morris held that the concept of \"fǎ\" had an association with \"yì\" (義: \"social rightness\"). Yan Fu, in his Chinese translation of Montesquieu's \"De l'esprit des lois\" published in 1913, warned his readers about the difference between the Chinese \"fǎ\" and Western law: \"The word 'law' in Western languages has four different interpretations in Chinese as in \"lǐ\" (理: \"order\"), \"lǐ\" (禮: \"rites\", \"decorum\"), \"fǎ\" (法: \"human laws\") and \"zhì\" (制: \"control\").\n\nA term which preceded \"fǎ\" was \"xíng\" (刑), which originally probably referred to decapitation. \"Xíng\" later evolved to be a general term for laws that related to criminal punishment. The early history \"Shang Shu\" recorded the earliest forms of the \"five penalties\": tattooing, disfigurement, castration, mutilation, and death. Once written law came into existence, the meaning of \"xíng\" was extended to include not only punishments but also any state prohibitions whose violation would result in punishments. In modern times, \"xíng'penal law or criminal law. An example of the classical use of \"xíng\" is \"Xíng Bù\" (刑部, lit. \"Department of Punishment\") for the legal or justice department in imperial China.\n\nThe two major Chinese philosophical schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced the idea of law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus create a sense of shame which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to be publicly promulgated standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The common factor is that both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which knows better than its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today.\n\nUnlike many other major civilizations where written law was held in honor and often attributed to divine origin, law in early China was viewed in purely secular terms, and its initial appearance was greeted with hostility by Confucian thinkers as indicative of a serious moral decline, a violation of human morality, and even a disturbance of the total cosmic order. Historically, the people's awareness and acceptance of ethical norms was shaped far more by the pervasive influence of custom and usage of property and by inculcating moral precepts than by any formally enacted system of law. Early emperors however embraced the Legalist ideal as a way of exerting control over their large and growing territory and population. This process was integrated with traditional Chinese beliefs in the cosmic order, holding that correct behavior was behavior consonant with the appropriate responses set by \"fǎ\". \"Xíng\" states the potential costs to the individual of exceeding them and imposes penalties for these actions.\n\nThe imperial period was characterized mainly by the concept of law as serving the state, a means of exerting control over the citizenry. In the late Qing dynasty there were efforts to reform the law codes mainly by importing German codes with slight modifications. This effort continued and was amplified in the republican period resulting in the Provisional Constitution of 1912 which included the idea of equality under the law, rights for women, and broader rights for citizens vis-à-vis the government. The onset of the communist period at first rolled back the development of individual rights with the primary concept of law returning to that of a tool of the state. After the Cultural Revolution devastated the ranks of intellectuals and legal professionals, it took until 1982 for the idea of individual rights to reemerge as a significant influence on Chinese law.\n\nThe current constitution, created in 1982, states in Article V that no organization or individual is above the law and in Article III makes the People’s Congresses and state administration responsible to the people, paving the way for later efforts to allow enforcement of individual rights. Passage of the Administrative Litigation Law of 1987 created legal recourse for individuals from arbitrary government action, an avenue previously unavailable. Despite the deep-seated norm against legal proceedings, litigation in the Chinese courts has increased dramatically, especially in recent years. The continuing weakness of courts resulting from their dependence on the local government for financial support and enforcement undermines the effectiveness of these remedies but this has also begun to change with China’s initiatives to increase legal training and the professionalism of the judiciary.\n\nOne avenue of individual appeal from government action which continues to be important is the custom of \"xìnfǎng\" or petitions by citizens to the individuals officials for change. The continuing wide use of \"xìnfǎng\" reflects the fact that many officials are still able to avoid legal sanctions and the underlying avoidance of the legal system, as well as the personal ability of officials to personally intervene to change unjust results. Recently \"xìnfǎng\" has been institutionalized to some extent with the central government mandating that every level of administration establish a \"xìnfǎng\" office to handle petitions and report them up to high levels. This solution by exertion of personal power clearly goes against the idea of rule of law, and worse, some scholars have noted that \"xìnfǎng\" today functions more as an informational collection system for the government than an effective review mechanism.\n\nConfucianism and Legalism are two major Classical legal theories or philosophies developed during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, a time that saw the most impressive proliferation of new ideas and philosophies in Chinese history. While both theories call for governmental hierarchy, they differ drastically in their views of human potential and the preferred means to achieve political order. Nevertheless, both theories have influenced and continue to influence the development of cultural, social, and legal norms in China.\n\nThe basic premise of Confucianism is the idea that human beings are fundamentally good. With this optimistic view on human potential, Confucius advocates for ruling through \"li\" – traditional customs, mores, and norms – which allow people to have a sense of shame and become humane people with good character, rather than through government regulations and penal law. The idea is that people will internalize the acceptable norms and only take proper actions. This will not only lead to a harmonious social order, but it will also provide the additional benefit of improving an individual’s inner character and the overall quality of the society. In contrast, codified laws require external compliance, and people may abide by the laws without fully understanding the reason for compliance. As such, a social order achieved through formal laws does not come with the additional benefit of better citizenry. It is worth noting, however, that even Confucius did not advocate for the elimination of formal laws. Rather, according to Confucius, laws should be used minimally and reserved only for those that insist on pursuing one’s self-interests without taking into account the well being of the society.\n\nAs Confucius rejects the general use of formal laws to achieve social order, what lies vital to Confucius’ theory is the willing participation by citizens of the society to search for commonly accepted, cooperative solutions. In addition to willing participation of citizens, there must also be grounds or bases upon which commonly acceptable solutions can be arrived at – the concept known as \"li\". \"Li\" is commonly understood as a set of culturally and socially valued norms that provide guidance to proper behaviors that will ultimately lead to a harmonious society. These norms are not fixed or unchangeable over time but rather a reflection of what is accepted at a particular time in a particular context. When conflicts arise, the \"li\" have to be applied and interpreted to produce a just result and restore the harmony of the society. However, in the absence of any procedural safeguard afforded by codified laws, interpretation of \"li\" is subject to abuse.\n\nRecognizing that people in a society hold diverse interests, Confucius charges the ruler with the responsibility to unify these interests and maintain social order. This is not done by dictatorship but by setting an example. Therefore, a ruler needs not to force his people to behave properly. Instead, the ruler needs only to make himself respectful, and the people will be induced and enlightened by his superior virtues to follow his example – an ideal known as \"wúwéi\". Nevertheless, the ruler must know and understand the \"li\" to be able to create solutions to conflict and problems the society faces. As the people are to follow the moral standards and example set by the ruler, to a large extent, the quality of the ruler determines the quality of the political order.\n\nIn contrast to Confucius’ \"li\"-based theory, the Legalism advocates the utilization of codified laws and harsh punishment to achieve social order. This is due to the legalists’ belief that all human beings are born evil and self-interested. Therefore, if left unrestrained, people would engage in selfish behavior which will undoubtedly lead to social unrest. To cure this defect and force people to behave morally, the only way, believed the legalists, is to publicly promulgate clearly written laws and impose harsh punishments.\n\nRealizing that the abilities of rulers are often limited and that reliance on the ruler’s ability and judgment often leads to adverse results, the legalists designed a system in which the law is run by the state, not the ruler. This ensures that the laws will be applied impartially without the interference of personal bias of the ruler or ones who are responsible for applying the laws. It also makes it irrelevant whether the ruler has superior abilities. This non-action promoted by the legalists is their understanding of the concept of \"wuwei\", which is different from the Confucians’ understanding of the same concept.\n\nNotwithstanding such an understanding, the ruler, like in Confucianism, has the ultimate authority to decide what the law should be. Therefore, like Confucianism, Legalism is subject to abuse as well. In fact, the Qin emperor implemented strict laws and extremely harsh punishments without taking into account mitigating circumstances even for insignificant crimes. For example, books were burned and people holding different ideals were buried alive. While the Qin emperor successfully instilled fear and respect for law into the minds of his people, the harshness of the law led to his quick demise after only 14 years of reigning over China.\n\nIn summary, although both Confucianism and Legalism were developed in a period of turmoil and both were aimed at the re-unification of the country, the two theories went opposite directions with one advocating for and one against the use of formal laws to achieve social order. What the two theories have in common is their concession of the ultimate authority to the ruler, who remained above and beyond the li or law. It is true that neither theory is ideal in achieving a social order. Nevertheless, both theories have had a significant impact on the cultural and legal development in China, and their influence remains visible today.\n\nThe significant influence of the Legalist tradition in Chinese law has historically been overlooked. Although the Confucian ideology provided the fundamentals for the substance of traditional law, the Legalist school constructed the important framework of the traditional legal system. The Han dynasty retained the basic legal system established under the Qin but modified some of the harsher aspects in line with the Confucian philosophy of social control.\n\nThe Han dynasty formally recognized four sources of law: \"lü\" (律: \"codified laws\"), \"ling\" (令: \"the emperor's order\"), \"ke\" (科: \"statutes inherited from previous dynasties\") and \"bi\" (比: \"precedents\"), among which \"ling\" has the highest binding power over the other three. Most legal professionals were not lawyers but generalists trained in philosophy and literature. The local, classically trained, Confucian gentry played a crucial role as arbiters and handled all but the most serious local disputes.\n\nEventually, the incorporation of the essentials of Confucianist \"li\" into legal codes occurred with this Confucian conception dominating ancient Chinese law. Ch'ü concludes that the gradual process of Confucianisation of law was the most significant development in the legal system of China prior to 20th century modernization. The line between ruling by moral influence and ruling by punishment was not always clearly delineated. For example, \"li\" could be enforced by moral influence and legal means. The metamorphosis of \"li\" into law depended on its widespread and unvaried acceptance by society.\n\nAlthough the codification of law was largely completed by the \"Tang Code\" of CE 624, throughout the centuries the Confucian foundations of the Tang Code were retained, and indeed with some aspects of it strengthened by the later dynasties. \"The Great Ming Code\", which was a model for the Qing code, covered every part of social and political life, especially family and ritual, but also foreign relations and even relations of earthly life with the cosmos. \n\nThe Confucian notion that morality and self-discipline was more important than legal codes caused many historians, such as Max Weber, until the mid-20th century to conclude that law was not an important part of Imperial Chinese society. This notion, however, has come under extreme criticism and is no longer the conventional wisdom among Sinologists, who have concluded that Imperial China had an elaborate system of both criminal and civil law which was comparable to anything found in Europe.\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, criminal justice was based on extremely detailed \"Great Qing Legal Code\". One element of the traditional Chinese criminal justice system is the notion that criminal law has a moral purpose, one of which is to get the convicted to repent and see the error of his ways. In the traditional Chinese legal system, a person could not be convicted of a crime unless he has confessed. This often led to the use of torture, in order to extract the necessary confession. These elements still influence modern Chinese views toward law. All capital offenses were reported to the capital and required the personal approval of the emperor.\n\nThere was no civil code separate from the criminal code, which led to the now discredited belief that traditional Chinese law had no civil law. More recent studies have demonstrated that most of the magistrates' legal work was in civil disputes, and that there was an elaborate system of civil law which used the criminal code to establish torts.\n\nThe introduction and translation of Western legal texts into Chinese is believed to have been started under the auspices of Lin Zexu in 1839. More systematic introduction of Western law together with other Western sciences started with the establishment of Tongwen Guan in 1862. The major efforts in translation of Western law that continued until the 1920s prepared the building blocks for modern Chinese legal language and Chinese law. Legal translation was very important from 1896 to 1936 during which period the Chinese absorbed and codified their version of Western laws. These efforts were assisted by the medium of the Japanese legal language and law developed in Japan during the Meiji period which involved in large part Japanese translation of European Continental laws.\n\nIn the late Qing dynasty there was a concerted effort to establish legal codes based on European models. Because of the German victory in the Franco-Prussian War and because Japan was used as the model for political and legal reform, the law codes which were adopted were modeled closely after that of Germany.\n\nAttitudes toward the traditional Chinese legal system changed markedly in the late-20th century. Most Chinese and Westerners of the early 20th century regarded the traditional Chinese legal system as backward and barbaric. However, extensive research into China's traditional legal system has caused attitudes to become more favorable in the late-20th and early 21st centuries. Researchers of the early and mid-20th century tended to compare the traditional Chinese legal system to then contemporary systems, finding the former to be backward. However, more recent research compared the 18th-century Chinese legal system to European systems of the 18th century, resulting in a far more positive view of traditional Chinese law. \n\nThe Department of Punishment was changed to \"fa bu\" (法部: \"Department of Law\") in the early 1900s legal reforms.\n\nLaw in the Republic of China (Taiwan) is mainly a civil law system. The legal structure is codified into the Six Codes: the Constitution, the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedures, the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedures and in Administrative Laws.\n\nAfter the Communist victory in 1949, the newly established People's Republic of China (PRC) quickly abolished the ROC's legal codes and attempted to create a system of socialist law copied from the Soviet Union. With the Sino-Soviet split (1960-1989) and the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), all legal work came under suspicion of being counter-revolutionary, and the legal system completely collapsed.\n\nOver the past century China has had several constitutions. The first attempts towards implementing a constitution in China occurred during the final decade (1902-1912) of the Qing Dynasty. Various controlling groups subsequently promulgated different constitutions between that time and the establishment of the PRC in 1949. The PRC had a provisional constitution from its inception until the enactment of its first constitution in 1954. This initial constitution was based on the constitution of the Soviet Union. It was shortly ignored, however, and became without legal force. Although it provided for the election of the National People’s Congress (NPC) every four years as the highest state power, these guidelines were not adhered to. The second constitution of the PRC, modeled on the ideology of the Cultural Revolution, came into force in 1975. This constitution subjected the NPC to the Communist Party of China and removed previous constitutional protections such as equality under the law and private-property succession rights. It was also immediately disregarded through breaches of its provisions and non-adherence to guidelines regarding the NPC. The third constitution of the PRC was adopted in 1978. Although this version moved away from the ideologies of the Cultural Revolution, it did retain some remnants of it. It also retained Communist Party control over the state structure. However, reformists subsequently gained power, which led to the breakdown of this constitution as focus shifted to economic construction and modernization.\n\nWith the start of the Deng Xiaoping reforms (ca 1979), the need for reconstructing a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses was seen. In 1982 the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the rule of law under which even party leaders are theoretically held accountable. Legal reconstruction occurred in piece-meal fashion. Typically, temporary or local regulations would be established; after a few years of experimentation, conflicting regulations and laws would be standardized.\n\nThe Constitution of the PRC, enacted in 1982, reflects the model of the first PRC constitution. The Constitution provides for leadership through the working class, led in turn by the Communist Party. This Constitution also contains more extensive rights than any of the previous constitutions. The rights include equality before the law, political rights, religious freedom, personal freedom, social and economic rights, cultural and educational rights, and familial rights. These rights, however, are connected to social duties. The duties include safeguarding the unity, security, honor, and interests of the country, observing law and social ethics, paying taxes, and serving in the military. Neither the rights nor duties provided for in the Constitution are exhaustive.\n\nThe Constitution provides that the NPC is the supreme organ of state power over a structure of other people's congresses at various levels. The NPC has power to:\n\n\nThe NPC also includes a Standing Committee that functions much as the NPC does when the NPC is not in session. Although the Standing Committee has had some powers since 1955, its law-making powers were initially provided for in the 1982 Constitution. The NPC sits at the highest level in the hierarchy of governmental structure in the PRC. This national level is followed in descending order by the provincial level (including autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the national level), the prefectural level, the county level, and the townships and towns level. Government members at the lower two levels are directly elected, and those at the higher levels are elected by the lower levels. In addition to the NPC, the provincial people's congresses possesses legislative power and can pass laws so long as they do not contravene the Constitution or higher legislation or administrative regulations.\n\nThe Constitution states its own supremacy. However, it has been theorized that the supremacy of the Communist Party means that the Constitution and law are not supreme, and that this perspective results from the Marxist view of law as simply a superstructure combined with a lack of recognition of rule of law in philosophical or historical tradition. Although the Constitution provides for legislative, executive, judicial, and procuratorial powers, they all remain subject to Communist Party leadership. Often, important political decisions are made through actions which are not regulated by the Constitution. Additionally, courts need not rely on the Constitution in deciding cases, and they may not review legislation for Constitutionality. Nonetheless the Constitution does provide the linguistic framework for conducting government affairs and describing them in the media.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 300 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. The use of mediation committees, informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties, is one innovative device. More than 800,000 such committees operate - in both rural and urban areas.\n\nIn drafting the new laws, the PRC has not copied any other legal system wholesale, and the general pattern has involved issuing laws for a specific topic or location. Often laws are drafted on a trial basis, with the law being redrafted after several years. This process of creating a legal infrastructure piecemeal has led to many situations where the laws are missing, confusing, or contradictory, and has led to judicial decisions having more precedental value than in most civil law jurisdictions. In formulating laws, the PRC has been influenced by a number of sources, including traditional Chinese views toward the role of law, the PRC's socialist background, the German-based law of the Republic of China on Taiwan, and the English-based common law used in Hong Kong.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. The Chinese government has promoted a reform it often calls \"legalisation\" (法制化). Legalisation, among other things, has provided the régime with a gloss of legitimacy and has enhanced predictability. There have been major efforts in the rationalization and strengthening of the legal structure and institution building in terms of developing and improving the professionalism of the legislature, judiciary and legal profession. As market reforms have deepened and social inequality has widened, legal forums – ranging from mediation and arbitration commissions to courts – have come to play an increasingly prominent role.\n\nThe 1994 Administrative Procedural Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal-procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal-law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity. However political dissidents are sometimes charged on the grounds of subverting state security or of publishing state secrets. Criminal-procedures reforms also encouraged establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. Minor crimes such as prostitution and drug use are sometimes dealt with under re-education through labor laws. The PRC constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, but some have argued that they are often ignored in practice. (See Human rights in the People's Republic of China.)\n\nThe basic principles of Chinese legislative drafting include generality and flexibility. Sometimes excessive generality and omissions in Chinese law, coupled with the wide discretionary powers conferred on local authorities to implement laws, undermines the predictability and certainty of law. Furthermore, as Chinese law is intended to be educative, the language of the law is that of the ordinary language comprehensible to the average citizen, although many laws are drafted in broad and indeterminate language.\n\nAs a result of a pending trade war with the United States of America over violations of intellectual property rights of American corporations in the early 1990s, the People's Republic of China's trademark law has been modified and offers significant protections to foreign trademark-owners.\n\nAfter their respective transfers of sovereignty, Hong Kong and Macau continue to practice English Common Law and Portuguese legal systems respectively, with their own courts of final appeal. In other words, Hong Kong and Macau lie outside of the legal jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China, except on constitutional issues.\n\nDue to the growing sophistication of Chinese laws, the expansion of the rule of law, as well as an influx of foreign law firms, China has also begun to develop a legal-services market. Foreign lawyers have accompanied foreign capital and their clients to China, which has had an immense influence on the promulgation of new Chinese laws based on international norms, especially in regards to intellectual property and corporate and securities law.\n\nOn July 1, 1992, in order to meet growing demand, the Chinese government opened the legal-services market to foreign law-firms, allowing them to establish offices in China when the Ministry of Justice and the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAOIC) issued the Provisional Regulation of Establishment of Offices by Foreign Law Firms regulation.\n\nAs a result, many foreign law firms, including the United States' Baker & McKenzie and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, along with several British firms, incorporated consulting firms in their home countries or in Hong Kong and then set up subsidiaries in Beijing or Shanghai to provide legal services.\n\nHowever, many regulatory barriers to entry remain to protect the domestic legal industry. Issues relating to Chinese law must be referred to Chinese law firms, and foreign lawyers are also prohibited from interpreting or practicing Chinese law or from representing their clients in court. However, in reality many foreign law firms interpret laws and manage litigation by directing the local firms they must have cooperative relationships with. In this regard, China's restrictive legal market can be directly tied to a phobia of people asserting their legal rights in the face of rampant corruption. Information received from the State Council Legislative Office suggests that China may be allowing foreigners to sit the Chinese Lawyers Examination, or have a mutual recognition treaty with other countries to allow foreign lawyers to conduct non-litigation Chinese legal work.\n\nWhile China's legal market continues to open up, China's laws and regulations have helped the development of a number of domestic Chinese firms specializing in working with foreigners to meet the demand of a booming economy. According to \"Asia Law and Business\" magazine China Awards, the top China firms were King & Wood PRC Lawyers, Commerce & Finance Law Offices, Fangda Partners, Haiwen & Partners, Jun He Law Offices and Lehman, Lee & Xu.\n\nClassical Chinese does not have a semantic equivalent to the concept of \"rights\". The idea of rights was introduced to China from the West. Its translation as \"quánlì\" (权利) was coined by William Alexander Parsons Martin in 1864, in his translation of Henry Wheaton's \"Elements of International Law\"...\n\nOne of the most commonly used phrases in contemporary China, by legal scholars and politicians alike, is fǎzhì (法治). Fǎzhì can be translated into English as “rule of law”, but questions have often been asked whether Chinese leaders meant \"rule by law\", which means the instrumental use of laws by rulers to facilitate social control and to impose punishment as understood in the Legalist tradition. The related concepts of yǐ fǎzhì guó (以法治国: \"governing the nation with law\") and jiànshè shèhuì zhǔyì fǎzhì guójiā (建设社会主义法制国家: \"building a socialist rule of law state\") have been part of the Chinese Communist Party's official policy since the mid-1990s. In 1999, the NPC adopted an amendment to the Chinese Constitution, incorporating both concepts in Article 5.\n\nThe existence of the rule of law in China has been widely debated. When discussing Chinese law, it is worth noting that various expressions have been used, including “strengthening the law,” “tightening up the legal system,” “abiding by the law in administration,” “rule by law,” and the “rule of law”. Different shades of meanings have been attached to each of these terms, but Chinese officials and scholars have employed the expressions rather loosely and sometimes interchangeably. However, the central government had originally preferred the expression, “strengthening the law/legal system” to “the rule of law”. It was thought that the latter might give a controversial connotation of the instrumentality, while the former conveyed a straightforward meaning of strengthening the law and institutions. “Strengthening the law” meant reform of legislation and enforcement of laws.\nThere are differing theories of the rule of law. One theory is the \"thin\", or formal, theory of rule of law, and the other is the \"thick\" theory.\n\nThe \"thin\" theory of rule of law is described by Randall Peerenboom as at the basest level incorporating a legal system that imposes meaningful restraints on the state and individuals in ruling power, that the law is supreme, and that all citizens are equal before the law (Peerenboom, 2). According to Lon Fuller’s account of thin theory, rule of law exists in a society when the laws of that society are “general, public, prospective, clear, consistent, capable of being followed, stable, and enforced” (Peerenboom, 3). The thin theory has also been explained by Joseph Raz as emphasizing the formal or instrumental aspects of a legal system regardless of whether it is part of a particular political structure, i.e. a democratic or non-democratic society.[14] Thick theory rule of law espouses all the elements of thin theory in addition imposes a political, social, and economic concept into the rule of law. The rule of law is regarded by some as presupposing political or economic structures of liberal democracy, human rights and other ideal socio-legal order.[11] Some scholars believe that given China's socialist and non-democratic political system and practice, it is at best regarded as a country of rule by law with law used by the state as an instrument for social control.[12] However, others rely on the formal or thin theory of rule of law to interpret fazhi as a legal reality in China.[13] Additionally, some believe that China may still fall short of the thin theory of rule of law.\n\nOf particular relevance to the second principle set out above, was the enactment of the Administrative Permission Law of the PRC (APL) on 27 August 2003, effective from July 2004. The APL for the first time requires all laws and regulations that subject any civil act to approval requirements to be published.\n\nThe APL also provides that only those laws adopted by the National People’s Congress or its Standing Committee, administrative regulations promulgated by the State Council, and local regulations adopted by the local people’s congresses may impose administrative approval requirements. Individual ministries or agencies (central or local) do not have such powers except in specified circumstances. This is consistent with the hierarchy of laws and regulations provided under the Legislative Law of the PRC. The enactment of the APL represents an encouraging step forward.\n\nDespite the newly elevated role of courts in Chinese society, there still remains some consensus about defects in China’s legal system in regards to progressing towards the rule of law. Scholars point to the following defects as slowing movement toward rule of law. These include:\n\nIn the 2000s, the Weiquan movement began in the PRC, seeking to advance citizens' rights partly by petitioning for enforcement of existing laws, and partly through activism. Lawyers in the movement have seen some court victories, but in other cases they are unsuccessful.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29720951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29720951", "title": "Civilian casualty ratio", "text": "Civilian casualty ratio\n\nIn armed conflicts, the civilian casualty ratio (also civilian death ratio, civilian-combatant ratio, etc.) is the ratio of civilian casualties to combatant casualties, or total casualties. The measurement can apply either to casualties inflicted by or to a particular belligerent, casualties inflicted in one aspect or arena of a conflict or to casualties in the conflict as a whole. Casualties usually refer to both dead and injured. In some calculations, deaths resulting from famine and epidemics are included.\n\nStarting in the 1980s, it was often claimed that 90 percent of the victims of modern wars were civilians. The claim was repeated on on 14 December 2010, and it has been repeated in academic publications as recently as 2014. These claims, though widely believed, are not supported by detailed examination of the evidence, particularly that relating to wars (such as those in former Yugoslavia and in Afghanistan) that are central to the claims. Some of the citations can be traced back to a 1991 monograph from Uppsala University which includes refugees and internally displaced persons as casualties. Other authors cite Ruth Leger Sivard's 1991 monograph in which the author states \"In the decade of the 1980s, the proportion of civilian deaths jumped to 74 percent of the total and in 1990 it appears to have been close to 90 percent.\"\n\nThe most comprehensive examination of civilian war deaths throughout history is by William Eckhardt, in which Eckhardt states:\n\nOn the average, half of the deaths caused by war happened to civilians, only some of whom were killed by famine associated with war...The civilian percentage share of war-related deaths remained at about 50% from century to century. (p. 97)\n\nAlthough it is estimated that over 1 million people died in the Mexican Revolution, most died from disease and hunger as an indirect result of the war. Combat deaths are generally agreed to have totaled about 250,000. According to Eckhardt, these included 125,000 civilian deaths and 125,000 combatant deaths, creating a civilian-combatant death ratio of 1:1 among combat deaths.\n\nSome 7 million combatants on both sides are estimated to have died during World War I, along with an estimated 10 million non-combatants, including 6.6 million civilians. The civilian casualty ratio in this estimate would be about 59%. Boris Urlanis notes a lack of data on civilian losses in the Ottoman Empire, but estimates 8.6 million military killed and dead and 6 million civilians killed and dead in the other warring countries. The civilian casualty ratio in this estimate would be about 42%. Most of the civilian fatalities were due to famine, typhus, or Spanish flu rather than combat action. The relatively low ratio of civilian casualties in this war is due to the fact that the front lines on the main battlefront, the Western Front, were static for most of the war, so that civilians were able to avoid the combat zones.\n\nChemical weapons were widely used by all sides during the conflict and wind frequently carried poison gas into nearby towns where civilians did not have access to gas masks or warning systems. An estimated 100,000-260,000 civilian casualties were affected by the use of chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more died from the effects of such weapons in the years after the conflict ended.\n\nGermany suffered 750,000 civilian dead during and after the war due to famine caused by the Allied blockade. Russia and Turkey suffered civilian casualties in the millions in the Russian Civil War and invasion of Anatolia respectively. Armenia suffered up to 1.5 million civilians dead in the Armenian Genocide.\n\nAccording to most sources, World War II was the most lethal war in world history, with some 70 million killed in six years. The civilian to combatant fatality ratio in World War II lies somewhere between 3:2 and 2:1, or from 60% to 67%. The high ratio of civilian casualties in this war was due in part to the increasing effectiveness and lethality of strategic weapons which were used to target enemy industrial or population centers, and famines caused by economic disruption. A substantial number of civilians in this war were also deliberately killed by Axis Powers as a result of racial policies (for example, the Holocaust) or ethnic cleansing campaigns.\n\nThe median total estimated Korean civilian deaths in the Korean War is 2,730,000. The total estimated North Korean combatant deaths is 213,000 and the estimated Chinese combatant deaths is over 400,000. In addition to this the Republic of Korea combatant deaths is around 134,000 dead and the combatant deaths for the United Nations side is around 49,000 dead and missing (40,000 dead, 9,000 missing). The estimated total Korean war military dead is around 793,000 deaths. The civilian-combatant death ratio in the war is approximately 2:1 or 67%. One source estimates that 20% of the total population of North Korea perished in the war.\n\nThe Vietnamese government has estimated the number of Vietnamese civilians killed in the Vietnam War at two million, and the number of NVA and Viet Cong killed at 1.1 million—estimates which approximate those of a number of other sources. This would give a civilian-combatant fatality ratio of approximately 2:1, or 67%. These figures do not include civilians killed in Cambodia and Laos. However, the lowest estimate of 411,000 civilians killed during the war (including civilians killed in Cambodia and Laos) would give a civilian-combatant fatality ratio of approximately 1:3, or 37%. Using the lowest estimate of Vietnamese military deaths, 400,000, the ratio is about 1:1.\n\nDuring the First Chechen War, 4,000 separatist fighters and 40,000 civilians are estimated to have died, giving a civilian-combatant ratio of 10:1. The numbers for the Second Chechen War are 3,000 fighters and 13,000 civilians, for a ratio of 43:10. The combined ratio for both wars is 76:10. Casualty numbers for the conflict are notoriously unreliable. The estimates of the civilian casualties during the First Chechen war range from 20,000 to 100,000, with remaining numbers being similarly unreliable. The tactics employed by Russian forces in both wars were heavily criticized by human rights groups, which accused them of indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilian areas and other crimes.\n\nIn 1999, NATO intervened in the Kosovo War with a bombing campaign against Yugoslav forces, who were alleged to be conducting a campaign of ethnic cleansing. The bombing lasted about 2½ months, until forcing the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Kosovo.\n\nEstimates for the number of casualties caused by the bombing vary widely depending on the source. NATO unofficially claimed a toll of 5,000 enemy combatants killed by the bombardment; the Yugoslav government, on the other hand, gave a figure of 638 of its security forces killed in Kosovo. Estimates for the civilian toll are similarly disparate. Human Rights Watch counted approximately 500 civilians killed by the bombing; the Yugoslav government estimated between 1,200 and 5,000.\n\nIf the NATO figures are to be believed, the bombings achieved a civilian to combatant kill ratio of about 1:10, on the Yugoslav government's figures, conversely, the ratio would be between 4:1 and 10:1. If the most conservative estimates from the sources cited above are used, the ratio was around 1:1.\n\nAccording to military historian and Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren, for every Serbian soldier killed by NATO in 1999 (the period in which Operation Allied Force took place), four civilians died, a civilian to combatant casualty ratio of 4:1. Oren cites this figure as evidence that \"even the most moral army can make mistakes, especially in dense urban warfare\".\n\nAccording to the Watson Institute for International & Public Affairs, as of January 2015 roughly 92,000 people had been killed in the Afghanistan war, of which over 26,000 were civilians, for a civilian to combatant ratio of 0.4:1.\n\nAccording to a 2010 assessment by John Sloboda of Iraq Body Count, a United Kingdom-based organization, American and Coalition forces had killed at least 28,736 combatants as well as 13,807 civilians in the Iraq War, indicating a civilian to combatant casualty ratio inflicted by coalition forces of 1:2. However, overall, figures by the Iraq Body Count from 20 March 2003 to 14 March 2013 indicate that of 174,000 casualties only 39,900 were combatants, resulting in a civilian casualty rate of 77%.\n\nThe civilian casualty ratio for U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan is notoriously difficult to quantify. The U.S. itself puts the number of civilians killed from drone strikes in the last two years at no more than 20 to 30, a total that is far too low according to a spokesman for the NGO CIVIC. At the other extreme, Daniel L. Byman of the Brookings Institution suggests that drone strikes may kill \"10 or so civilians\" for every militant killed, which would represent a civilian to combatant casualty ratio of 10:1. Byman argues that civilian killings constitute a humanitarian tragedy and create dangerous political problems, including damage to the legitimacy of the Pakistani government and alienation of the Pakistani populace from America. An ongoing study by the New America Foundation finds non-militant casualty rates started high but have declined steeply over time, from about 60% (3 out of 5) in 2004–2007 to less than 2% (1 out of 50) in 2012. The study puts the overall non-militant casualty rate since 2004 at 15–16%, or a 1:5 ratio, out of a total of between 1,908 and 3,225 people killed in Pakistan by drone strikes since 2004.\n\nEstimates of civilian casualties from the Israeli–Palestinian conflict differ. A 2007 report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) found that, from the beginning of the second intifada in September 2000 until the end of July 2007, at least 5,848 people were killed in the conflict, over half of whom were civilians. Amongst those killed in that period, 69% of Israelis were civilians, while the report estimated 59% of Palestinian casualties were civilians, although the status of a large number of Palestinian victims was unknown. 1,010 Israelis were killed between September 29, 2000 and January 1, 2005. Of these, 773 were civilians killed in Palestinian attacks, resulting in a ratio of approximately 5:1.\n\nThere are reports that Israel also used Palestinian civilians as human shields during the First and Second Intifadas, and on at least 14 UN-documented occasions between January 2010 and March 2013 alone, with pictures showing Palestinian minors tied up to the hoods of Israeli military vehicles or in other dangerous situations to prevent any attacks against them.\n\nin May 2012 B'Tselem decided to stop addressing the question of participation in combat, with respect to Palestinians killed in the West Bank, stating that, \"while in the past there were complicated incidents in the West Bank that might have met the definition of \"combat incidents,\" in recent years the incidents meeting that definition have been almost nil.\" B'Tselem has also established a separate category for recording Palestinian police officers killed by Israel; according to B'Tselem, Israel counts the Gaza police force as a non-civilian when calculating the civilian casualty ratio, and states that such a definition is not compatible with the ICRC interpretation of international law. The International Committee of the Red Cross regards persons as civilians if they do not fulfill a \"continuous combat function\" (for example, many police officers) and do not participate directly in hostilities. Analysts state that in addition to their civilian roles such as policing traffic, police in Gaza are active in counter-intelligence and fighting dissent.\n\nThe head of the Shin Bet reported to the Israeli Cabinet that of the 810 Palestinians killed in Gaza in 2006 and 2007, 200 were civilians (a ratio of approximately 1:3). \"Haaretz\" assessed this to be an underestimation of civilian casualties. Using figures from Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem they calculated that 816 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza during the two-year period, 360 of whom were civilians. Military journalist Amos Harel wrote in \"Haaretz\" that the ratio between military targets and civilians was 1:1 in 2002–2003, when half the casualties in air assaults on the Gaza Strip were civilians. He attributed this to an Israeli Air Force (IAF) practice of attacking militants even when they had deliberately located themselves in densely populated areas. The ratio improved to 1:28 ratio in late 2005, meaning one civilian killed for every 28 combatants. It lowered, however, to 1:10 in 2006. In 2007, the ratio was at its lowest ever, more than 1:30. Figures showing an improvement from 1:1 in 2002 to 1:30 in 2008 were also cited by \"Jerusalem Post\" journalist Yaakov Katz. However, in operations in Gaza since 2008, the ratio again dropped, as low as 5:2 during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.\n\nOn its web blog, the IDF stated that the IDF's civilian-to-terrorist death ratio is the lowest in the world. It says that civilian deaths are caused by the use of human shields by Gazan militant groups, such as Hamas. The IDF blog lists various counter-terrorism methods used by the IDF to minimize civilian casualties and lower the civilian casualty ratio, including pinpoint targeting, aborting strikes due to risk of civilian casualties, and smartbombs with the ability to cancel a strike whilst in midair.\n\nSeveral analysts have attempted to calculate the Israel Defense Forces's civilian casualty ratio in the 2008–09 Gaza War. All have noted that the ratio differs significantly depending on which figures are used regarding the total number of casualties and their identity. The main sets of figures are those published by the IDF, essentially corroborated by Hamas, the opposing belligerent in the conflict, on the one hand; and those published by B'Tselem on the other hand. The final IDF report identified 709 militants out of a total of 1,161 Gaza fatalities, with another 162 whose status could not be confirmed (300 were ID'd as civilians). B'Tselem say 1,391 Palestinians were killed, of whom 759 of them did not take part in the hostilities while 350 did take part in the hostilities, 248 were police officers who were killed inside police stations, and it is not known if 32 who were killed did take part in the hostilities.\n\nThe Goldstone Report into the conflict concluded that while there were many individual Gaza policemen who were members of militant groups, the Gaza police forces were a civilian police force and \"cannot be said to have been taking a direct part in hostilities and thus did not lose their civilian immunity from direct attack as civilians\".\n\nJournalist Yaakov Katz states in \"The Jerusalem Post\" that the ratio is 1:3 according to the Israeli figures and 60% civilians (3:2) according to B'Tselem's figures. Katz describes the IDF's civilian casaulty ratio in the Gaza War and in the year preceding it as low.\n\nKatz says that over 81 percent of the 5,000 missiles the IDF dropped in the Gaza Strip during the operation were smart bombs, a percentage which he states is unprecedented in modern warfare. Journalist and commentator Evelyn Gordon writes in \"Commentary\" that the civilian casualty ratio in the 2008–09 Gaza War was 39 percent (2:3), using however only the preliminary Israeli estimates, but that 56 or 74 percent were civilians according to B'Tselem's figures, depending on whether 248 Hamas policemen are considered combatants or civilians; and 65 or 83 percent according to the figures of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. Gordon says that all of these ratios, even if the worse were correct, are lower than the normal civilian-to-combatant wartime fatality ratio in wars elsewhere, as given by the Red Cross, and states that the comparison shows that the IDF was unusually successful at minimizing civilian casualties.\n\n13 Israelis were killed during the conflict, including 10 IDF soldiers (4 killed by friendly fire), giving a civilian casualty ratio for Palestinian forces of 24% or 3:10.\n\nReports of casualties in the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict have been made available by a variety of sources. Most media accounts have used figures provided by the government in Gaza or non-governmental organizations. Differing methodologies have resulted in varied reports of both the overall death toll and the civilian casualty ratio.\n\nAccording to the main estimates between 2,125 and 2,310 Gazans were killed and between 10,626 and 10,895 were wounded (including 3,374 children, of whom over 1,000 were left permanently disabled). 66 Israeli soldiers, 5 Israeli civilians (including one child) and one Thai civilian were killed and 469 IDF soldiers and 261 Israeli civilians were injured. The Gaza Health Ministry, UN and some human rights groups reported that 69–75% of the Palestinian casualties were civilians; Israeli officials estimated that around 50% of those killed were civilians., giving Israeli forces a ratio between 1:1 and 3:1 during the conflict.\n\nIn March 2015, OCHA reported that 2,220 Palestinians had been killed in the conflict, of whom 1,492 were civilians (551 children and 299 women), 605 militants and 123 of unknown status, giving Israeli forces a ratio of 5:2.\n\nIn 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon with the stated aim of driving the PLO away from its northern borders. The war culminated in a seven-week-long Israeli naval, air and artillery bombardment of Lebanon's capital, Beirut, where the PLO had retreated. The bombardment eventually came to an end with an internationally brokered settlement in which the PLO forces were given safe passage to evacuate the country.\n\nAccording to the International Red Cross, by the end of the first week of the war alone, some 10,000 people, including 2,000 combatants, had been killed, and 16,000 wounded—a civilian-combatant fatality ratio of 5:1. Lebanese government sources later estimated that by the end of the siege of Beirut, a total of about 18,000 had been killed, an estimated 85% of whom were civilians. This gives a civilian to military casualty ratio of about 6:1.\n\nAccording to Richard A. Gabriel between 1,000 and 3,000 civilians were killed in the southern campaign. He states that an additional 4,000 to 5,000 civilians died from all actions of all sides during the siege of Beirut, and that some 2,000 Syrian soldiers were killed during the Lebanon campaign and a further 2,400 PLO guerillas were also killed. Of these, 1,000 PLO guerrillas were killed during the siege. According to Gabriel the ratio of civilian deaths to combatants during the siege was about 6 to 1 but this ratio includes civilian deaths from all actions of all sides.\n\n"}

It is the most important national holiday in the country, and is considered to be the North Korean equivalent of Christmas. Kim's birthday, which had been an official holiday since 1968, was renamed Day of the Sun in 1997, three years after his death. The name takes its significance from his name; Il-sung is Korean for \"become the sun\".\n\nNorth Koreans commemorate the holiday by visiting locations that have a connection with the leader's life, such as thousands of statues scattered across the country, or Mangyongdae, his birthplace in the capital Pyongyang. The most important observances take place in the capital, including visits to Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where Kim Il-sung's body lies in rest, and Mansu Hill Grand Monument, which features a very tall statue of the leader.\n\nThe state seeks to provide its citizens with more food and electricity than is normally available, but success is not always guaranteed. Children, in particular, receive candy and other gifts attributed to love shown by the leaders.\n\nFestivities are not confined to the date. Commemorations occur from 16 February, which is the birthday of Kim Jong-il, during what is known as the Loyalty Festival. Celebrations in April around the Day of the Sun are called the Sun Festival. The day itself is followed by two days of rest, making it a three-day holiday.\n\nKim Il-sung was born on 15 April 1912 in the village of Mangyongdae, which is now a suburb of North Korea's capital Pyongyang. He has been long identified with the Sun and is frequently called \"Sun of the nation\". He adopted his name Il-sung (), meaning \"become the Sun\" before the early 1930s as one of his \"noms de guerre\".\n\nKim Il-sung's birthday had been designated as a provisional holiday in 1962. It became official 1968, the year that saw great expansion of his cult of personality in the aftermath of a domestic political crisis known as the Kapsan Faction Incident. In 1974, the day was promoted the most important holiday of the country. It was designated as \"The Day of the Sun\" on 8 July 1997, the third anniversary of the death of Kim Il-sung, in a resolution by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Central Military Commission, the National Defence Commission, the Central People's Committee and the Administration Council of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. On the same occasion, North Korea adopted the \"Juche\" calendar which begins on the year of Kim Il-sung's birth. The purpose of the Day of the Sun was to celebrate \"the greatest festival for the Korean nation,\" and to initiate a holiday which would be of equal importance to North Koreans as Christmas is in many other places.\n\nEvery fifth and tenth anniversary is marked with more pronounced celebrations than usual. 2012 marked the centenary of the birth of Kim Il-sung. On the Day of the Sun that year, current leader Kim Jong-un gave his first public speech. Massive military parades are held on the Day of the Sun and the country's most advanced weapons are displayed. In 2012 North Korea conducted a failed missile test and the new KN-08 missile was introduced in a parade.\n\nPreparations take more than a month. Through April there are exhibitions, fireworks, song and dance events, athletics competitions, \"Juche\" idea seminars and visits to places connected with Kim Il-sung's life, including his birthplace in Mangyongdae. Some of these events take several days. Foreign art groups and dignitaries are invited to visit North Korea during this time around the day itself known as Sun Festival. The annual Kimilsungia Festival (held since 1998) and the April Spring Friendship Art Festival (since 1982) are also held at around the time of the Day of the Sun. The latter typically features foreign performers from some 20 countries whose televised performances are an anticipated and well-liked rare glimpse of foreign culture for North Koreans. It also includes the Pyongyang Marathon.\n\nAs early as midnight on the morning of Day of the Sun, people lay commemorative wreaths and floral baskets at thousands of statues of Kim Il-sung around the country. The demand for flowers is huge. The market — mostly operating informally — is estimated to be worth 600,000–1,200,000 dollars just for the Day of the Sun. Artificial flowers are favored for their low cost. In the evening, youth dress in \"hanbok\" to participate in folk dances.\n\nThe main observances take place in the capital city of Pyongyang. Flowers are laid in front of Kim Il-sung's statue on Mansu Hill. People pay respects at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun where his body lies in state. In particular, leader Kim Jong-un has paid his respects at the palace every year. Pyongyang also often hosts the \"Arirang\" Festival mass-games to coincide with the celebration of the Day of the Sun. There has been an evening fireworks display in Pyongyang since 2009 and its design has been attributed to Kim Jong-un.\n\nThe state serves special foods such as meat and liquor as well as necessities to the people on the Day of the Sun to signal that all well-being is thanks to the care of the leader. The state tries to maintain a stable supply of electricity for the day to allow people to watch television, while theaters show special movies. The food situation varies. According to North Korean defector Kim Hyun-hwa: \"The Sun Festival is one of the few occasions during which everyone can eat to their heart's content. Even those who go hungry on a regular basis usually manage to obtain three meals on this day. This is because North Korea marks it as the biggest holiday for the Korean people.\" However, in 2015 the state reportedly failed to distribute rations and did not deliver middle-school uniforms that schoolchildren were expecting to receive.\n\nChildren under the age of 12 receive bags of of candy and cookies at ceremonies at school. Upon receiving this gift, they have to bow in front of portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il in the classroom and say: \"Thank you, the Great Leader Grandfather! And, thank you Father!\" Schoolchildren also prepare performances well in advance. On the 11th through 12th their teachers choose the best ones for the Day of the Sun. The Day of the Sun is one of the few occasions on which the Korean Children's Union admits new members.\n\nGovernment and business offices, banks, and retail close for the Day of the Sun. It is also a common holiday for weddings. The Day of the Sun is followed by two days of rest, making it a three-day holiday. The day following the Day of the Sun typically features political meetings in which the Ten Principles of the ideological system are sworn allegiance for.\n\nA similar holiday exists for 16 February, the birthday of former leader Kim Jong-il, known as the Day of the Shining Star. The two-month period between the Day of the Shining Star and the Day of the Sun is known as the Loyalty Festival Period and festivities occur throughout.\n\n\n"}

The book is co-authored by Fernando Flores, Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Spinosa (a consultant philosopher specializing in commercial innovation). They concentrate on three practical activities:\n\n\nThe authors reason that human beings are at their best when engaged in imaginative and practical innovation rather than in abstract reflection, and thus challenging accepted wisdom and conventional practices within their particular environment, or as the authors claim, when they are making history. History-making, in this account, refers not to political power changes, wars or violent revolution, but to changes in the way people understand their personal qualities and deal with their particular situations.\n\nWorld disclosure (German: Erschlossenheit, literally development or comprehension) is a phenomenon first described by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger in his landmark book Being and Time. As well as the authors of this work, the idea of disclosing has also been discussed by philosophers such as John Dewey, Jürgen Habermas, Nikolas Kompridis and Charles Taylor.

{"id": "78902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78902", "title": "Epode", "text": "Epode\n\nEpode, in verse, is the third part of an ode, which followed the strophe and the antistrophe, and completed the movement.\n\nAt a certain point in time the choirs, which had previously chanted to right of the altar or stage, and then to left of it, combined and sang in unison, or permitted the \"coryphaeus\" to sing for them all, while standing in the centre. With the appearance of Stesichorus and the evolution of choral lyric, a learned and artificial kind of poetry began to be cultivated in Greece, and a new form, the epode-song, came into existence. It consisted of a verse of iambic trimeter, followed by a verse of iambic dimeter, and it is reported that, although the epode was carried to its highest perfection by Stesichorus, an earlier poet, Archilochus, was really the inventor of this form.\n\nThe epode soon took a firm place in choral poetry, which it lost when that branch of literature declined. But it extended beyond the ode, and in the early dramatists we find numerous examples of monologues and dialogues framed on the epodical system. In Latin poetry the epode was cultivated, in conscious archaism, both as a part of the ode and as an independent branch of poetry. Of the former class, the epithalamia of Catullus, founded on an imitation of Pindar, present us with examples of strophe, antistrophe and epode; and it has been observed that the celebrated ode of Horace, beginning \"Quem virum aut heroa lyra vel acri\", possesses this triple character.\n\nThe word is now mainly familiar from an experiment of Horace in the second class, for he entitled his fifth book of odes \"Epodon liber\" or the \"Book of Epodes\". He says in the course of these poems, that in composing them he was introducing a new form, at least in Latin literature, and that he was imitating the effect of the iambic distichs invented by Archilochus. Accordingly, we find the first ten of these epodes composed in alternate verses of iambic trimeter and iambic dimeter, as at, for example, \"Epode\" 5.1–2:\n\nIn the seven remaining epodes Horace diversified the measures, while retaining the general character of the distich. This group of poems belongs mostly to the early youth of the poet, and displays a truculence and a controversial heat which are absent from his more mature writings. As he was imitating Archilochus in form, he believed himself justified, no doubt, in repeating the sarcastic violence of his fierce model. The curious thing is that these particular poems of Horace, which are really short lyrical satires, have appropriated almost exclusively the name of epodes, although they bear little enough resemblance to the epode of early Greek literature.\n\n"}

{"id": "1813173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813173", "title": "Ex nihilo", "text": "Ex nihilo\n\nIn theology, the common phrase (), contrasts with (creation out of some pre-existent, eternal matter) and (creation out of the being of God). is the ongoing divine creation.\n\nThe phrase also appears in the classical philosophical formulation , which means \"out of nothing comes nothing\".\n\nWhen used outside of religious or metaphysical contexts, also refers to something coming from nothing. For example, in a conversation, one might call a topic \"\" if it bears no relation to the previous topic of discussion.\n\nAncient Near Eastern mythologies and classical creation myths in Greek mythology envisioned the creation of the world as resulting from the actions of a god or gods upon already-existing primeval matter, known as \"chaos\".\n\nAn early conflation of Greek philosophy with the narratives in the Hebrew Bible came from Philo of Alexandria (d.AD50), writing in the context of Hellenistic Judaism. Philo equated the Hebrew creator deity, Yahweh, with Aristotle's \"primum movens\" (First Cause) in an attempt to prove that the Jews had held monotheistic views even before the Greeks. However, this was still within the context of creation from pre-existing materials (i.e., \"moving\" or \"changing\" a material substratum.)\n\nThe classical tradition of creation from chaos first came under question in Hellenistic philosophy (on \"a priori\" grounds), which developed the idea that the primum movens must have created the world out of nothing.\n\nTheologians debate whether the Bible itself teaches creation \"ex nihilo\". Traditional interpreters argue on grammatical and syntactical grounds that this is the meaning of , which is commonly rendered: \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\" They find further support for this view in New Testament passages such as Hebrews 11:3—\"By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible\" and Revelation 4:11, \"For you [God] created all things, and by your will they existed and were created.\" However, other interpreters understand creation \"ex nihilo\" as a second-century theological development. According to this view, church fathers opposed notions appearing in pre-Christian creation myths and in Gnosticism—notions of creation by a demiurge out of a primordial state of matter (known in religious studies as \"chaos\" after the Greek term used by Hesiod in his \"Theogony\"). Jewish thinkers took up the idea, which became important to Judaism, to ongoing strands in the Christian tradition, and—as a corollary—to Islam.\n\nThe first sentence of the Greek version of Genesis in the Septuagint starts with the words: ἐν ἀρχῇ ἐποίησεν, translatable as \"in the beginning he made\".\n\nA verse of 2 Maccabees (a book written in Koine Greek in the same sphere of Hellenized Judaism of Alexandria, but predating Philo by about a century) expresses the following: \"I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind made likewise.\" (2Maccabees 7:28, KJV). While those who believe in \"ex nihilo\" point to God creating \"things that were not\", those who reject creation out of nothing point out that the context mentions the creation of man, who was \"made from the dust\" and not from absolutely \"nothing\". Many ancient texts tend to have similar issues, and those on each side tend to interpret the text according to their understanding.\n\nMax Weber summarizes a sociological view of the overall development and corollaries of the theological idea:\n\n[...] As otherworldly expectations become increasingly important, the problem of the basic relationship of god to the world and the problem of the world's imperfections press into the foreground of thought; this happens the more life here on earth comes to be regarded as a merely provisional form of existence when compared to that beyond, the more the world comes to be viewed as something created by god \"ex nihilo\", and therefore subject to decline, the more god himself is conceived as a subject to transcendental goals and values, and the more a person's behavior in this world becomes oriented to his fate in the next. [...]\n\nA major argument for \"creatio ex nihilo\", the first cause argument, states in summary:\n\nAn expansion of the first cause argument is the Kalam cosmological argument, which also requires \"creatio ex nihilo\": \n\nAnother argument for \"ex nihilo\" creation comes from Claude Nowell's Summum philosophy that states before anything existed, nothing existed, and if nothing existed, then it must have been possible for nothing to be. If it is possible for nothing to be (the argument goes), then it must be possible for everything to be.\n\nSome scholars have argued that Plethon viewed Plato as positing \"ex nihilo\" creation in his \"Timaeus\".\n\nEric Voegelin detects in Hesiod's chaos a \"creatio ex nihilo\".\n\nThe School of Chartres understood the creation account in Plato's Timaeus to refer to creatio ex nihilo.\n\nIn \"The Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma\" (\"Kitāb al-Amānāt wa l-Iʿtiqādāt\", \"Emunoth ve-Deoth\", completed 933) written by Saadia Gaon (c. 882−942) the metaphysical problems of the creation of the world and the unity of the Creator are discussed. In this book, Saadia Gaon gives four proofs for the doctrine of the creation of the world \"ex nihilo\" (\"yesh me-ayin\").\n\nTo harmonize the biblical statement of the creation \"ex nihilo\" with the doctrine of the primordial elements, the \"Sefer Yetzirah\" assumes a double creation, one ideal and the other real.\n\nIn introducing \"Sefer Yetzirah's\" theory of creation Saadia Gaon makes a distinction between the Biblical account of creation \"ex nihilo\", in which no process of creation is described, and \"matter formed by speech\" as described in \"Sefer Yetzirah\". The cosmogony of \"Sefer Yetzirah\" is even omitted from the discussion of creation in his magnum opus \"Emunoth ve-Deoth\".\n\nEarly Islamic philosophy, as well as key Muslim schools of thought, have argued a wide array of views, the basis always being that the creator was an eternal being who was outside of the creation (i.e., any materially based entities within all of creation), and was not a part of creation. Several schools of thought stemming from the first cause argument, and a great deal of philosophical works from Muslim scholars such as Al-Ghazali, came from the following verses in the Qur'an. The following quotations come from Muhammad Asad's translation, \"The Message of The Qur'an\":\n\nBiblical scholars and theologians within the Christian tradition such as Augustine (354–430), John Calvin (1509–1564), John Wesley (1703–1791), and Matthew Henry (1662–1714) cite Genesis1:1 in support of the idea of Divine creation out of nothing.\n\nSome of the early Christian Church Fathers with a Platonic background argued that the act of creation itself involved pre-existent matter, but made that matter in turn to have been created out of nothing.\n\nThe RigVeda quotes \"If in the beginning there was neither Being nor Non-Being, neither air nor sky, what was there? Who or what oversaw it? What was it when there was no darkness, light, life, or death? We can only say that there was the One, that which breathed of itself deep in the void, that which was heat and became desire and the germ of spirit,\" which is suggestive of the fact that Ex nihilo creator was always there and he is not controlled by time or by any previous creation.\n\nA widely supported hypothesis in modern physics is the zero-energy universe which states that the total amount of energy in the universe is exactly zero. It has been argued that this is the only kind of universe that could come from nothing. Such a universe would have to be flat in shape, a state which does not contradict current observations that the universe is flat with a 0.5% margin of error.\n\nThe paper \"Spontaneous creation of the Universe Ex Nihilo\" provides a model for a way the Universe could have been created from pure 'nothing' in information terms.\n\nThe \"first cause\" argument was rooted in ancient Greek philosophy and based on observation in physics. Originally, it was understood in the context of creation from chaos. The observed phenomenon seen in reality is that nothing moves by itself. In other words, motion is not self-caused; thus, the Classic Greek thinkers argued that the cosmos must have had a \"prime mover\" \"primum movens\". However, this scientific observation of \"motion\" does not logically extend to the idea of \"existence\", and therefore does not necessarily indicate creation from absolutely nothing.\n\nIn theology, \"ex nihilo\" creation states that there was a beginning to one's existence, and anything that exists has a beginning. This idea of a \"required beginning\" appears to contradict the proposed creator who existed \"without a beginning\". In other words, people are considered to be contingent beings, and their existence depends upon a non-contingent being. However, if non-contingency is possible, then there is no basis for arguing that contingency is required for existence, nor can it be logically concluded that the number of non-contingent beings or non-contingent things is limited to one single substance or one single Being.\n\nDavid Ray Griffin expressed his thoughts on this as follows: \"No special philosophical problems are raised by this view: If it is intelligible to hold that the existence of God requires no explanation, since something must exist necessarily and \"of itself,\" then it is not unintelligible to hold that that which exists necessarily is God \"and\" a realm of non-divine actualities.\"\n\nBruce K. Waltke wrote an extensive Biblical study of creation theology in which he argues for creation from chaos rather than from nothing - based on the Hebrew Torah and the New Testament texts. The Western Conservative Baptist Seminary published this work in 1974 and again in 1981. On a historical basis, many scholars agree that the doctrine of \"creatio ex nihilo\" was not the original intent of the Biblical authors, but instead a change in the \"interpretation\" of the texts that began to evolve in the mid-second century AD in the atmosphere of Hellenistic philosophy. The idea solidified around 200AD in arguments and in response to the Gnostics, Stoics, and Middle Platonists.\n\nThomas Jay Oord, a Christian philosopher and theologian, argues that Christians should abandon the doctrine of creation \"ex nihilo\". Oord points to the work of biblical scholars such as Jon D. Levenson, who points out that the doctrine of \"creatio ex nihilo\" does not appear in Genesis. Oord speculates that God created our particular universe billions of years ago from primordial chaos. This chaos, however, did not predate God, for God would have created the chaotic elements as well. Oord suggests that God can create all things without creating from absolute nothingness.\n\nOord offers nine objections to \"creatio ex nihilo\":\n\nProcess theologians argue that humans have always related a God to some \"world\" or another. They also claim that rejecting \"creatio ex nihilo\" provides the opportunity to affirm that God has everlastingly created and related with some realm of non-divine actualities or another (compare continuous creation). According to this alternative God-world theory, no non-divine thing exists without the creative activity of God, and nothing can terminate God's necessary existence.\n\nSome non-trinitarian Christian churches do not teach the \"ex nihilo\" doctrine:\n\nThe Vedanta schools of Hinduism reject the concept of creation \"ex nihilo\" for several reasons, for example:\n\nThe \"Bhagavad Gita\" (BG) states the eternality of matter and its transformability clearly and succinctly: \"Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature.\" The opening words of Krishna in BG2.12-13 also imply this, as do the doctrines referred to in BG16.8 as explained by the commentator Vadiraja Tirtha.\n\nMost philosophical schools in Hinduism maintain that material creation started with some minute particle (or seed) which had to be co-eternal or a part of ultimate reality (Brahman). This minute starting point is also the point into which all creation contracts at the end of each cycle. This concept varies between various traditions, such as the Vishishtadvaita tradition (which asserts that the Universe forms a part of God, created from some aspect of His divinity) and Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta traditions (which state that the minute initial particle (shuddha Maya) has always existed and was never created).\n\nScholars have suggested alternative translations from the Biblical Hebrew for the concept often rendered as \"created\" in English-language versions of Genesis 1. Van Volde, for example, suggests that the Genesis account tells of the \"separation\" of existing material rather than of creation \"ex nihilo\".\n\nNote that ordinary language may lack a concise definitive native expression for \"creation \"ex nihilo\"\" - hence the need for the technical Latinate phrase itself. The English-language word \"create\" itself comes from the Latin \"creare\" (to make, bring forth, produce, beget), with a root cognate with \"crescere\" (to arise, to grow) and allied to the English word \"crescent\" (originally meaning \"growing\").\n\n\n"}

Through his research work between 1949 and 1968 he exercised a great influence on the understanding of economic history in West Germany. Together with Wilhelm Abel and he contributed decisively to research into in Germany. He was instrumental in ensuring that social and economic history emerged as an alternative strand to the prism of historical materialism that was mainstream in many German universities during this period. From this followed an insistence in his economic research that the subject needs to be studied not simply from a theoretical quasi-mathematical standpoint, but also empirically and in the context of broader historical considerations.\n\nFriedrich Karl Lütge was born into a Protestant family at the start of the twentieth century at Wernigerode, a midsized town located in the Harz Mountains between Hanover and Halle. He was the older of twin brothers. There were also two younger siblings. His father was a captain in the German merchant navy who was much involved with Kamerun trade, but died in 1905. As a child Friedrich Lütge suffered from a spinal disease which confined him to bed for three years. On 23 September 1918, while still at school he found himself recruited into an infantry regiment as a junior officer (\"Fahnenjunker\"), but by this time the First World War was nearly over and he was never sent into the fighting of it. However, in February 1919 he found himself taken into the Freikorps (\"\"militia\" unit\") of in Berlin, and he was involved in the putting down of the Spartacus uprising. It was only in 1921 that he passed his Abitur (school leaving exams) which opened the way to university-level education.\n\nIn 1921 Lütge enrolled at the University of Freiburg where he studied and History on a course directed by . That was followed by a term at the University of Marburg where he was taught by Albert Brackmann and . He concluded his student studies at the University of Jena where he was supervised for his doctorate by . Importantly for Lütge 's subsequent academic career, it was Gutmann who awakened his interest in . His doctoral dissertation concerned \"The liberation of the peasantry in the County of Wernigerode\". He was obliged to in order to support himself and his widowed mother.\n\nBriefly, between 15 October and 16 November 1923, he belonged to the so-called Black Reichswehr.\n\nUnusually, on 1 December 1928 Friedrich Lütge was awarded a second doctorate. This time his dissertation concerned the history of the book trade in Jena, including the impact of the invention of printing. The work was supervised by Georg Menz. While working on this doctorate he was also employed in Jena as a private researcher by the economist-statistician . Projects on which he worked with Elster included the fourth edition of the \"Wörterbuchs der Volkswirtschaftslehre\" (\"loosely, \"Lexicon of Applied Economics\"\") and the . He also authored a celebratory booklet in respect of the fiftieth anniversary of the : research for this commission supported and influenced the doctorate on which he was working at the same time. In 1929 he obtained a permanent position with as a literary editor and academic researcher. At Fischer he was entrusted with producing a number of works, mostly concerned with and Economic History\n\nIt was also in 1929 that Friedrich Lütge married Eva Buchfink, a daughter of General Ernst Buchfinck. The marriage produced one recorded son and two daughters.\n\nDuring the early 1930s he pursued his career with the publisher in parallel with his academic researches, publishing several essays on social policy and agricultural history. In 1934 he published a significant piece of work in which he pointed out that in central Germany as early as the early modern period a form of landlordship and tenancy existed which was based not on service obligation, but simply the handing over of produce. That contrasted with he versions of manorialism that was normal in the northern and southern parts of Germany. He followed this up in 1937 with a broadened study of the German agrarian economy, taking his research back to the middle ages and, in particular, to the Carolingian era. This meant that there had been fundamental regional variations in land tenure arrangements in Germany far earlier than had hitherto been believed. That same year he saw to the posthumous publication of the \"Outline history of the German rural economy in the middle ages\" (\"Geschichte der deutschen Landwirtschaft des Mittelalters in ihren Grundzügen\") by his former tutor, , using manuscripts that von Below had left behind when he died ten years earlier.\n\n1933 was the year of the National Socialist take-over. It was also the year in which Lütge joined the German National People's Party (\"Deutschnationale Volkspartei, \" / DNVP), though this party had dissolved itself by the end of that year. He also had close connections with the anti-government Confessing Church. He would later insist that his various longstanding memberships of associations connected with the army, notably the Stahlhelm, afforded him a measure of independence in his interactions with the National Socialist state. When the Stahlhelm was forcibly merged into the party's own Sturmabteilung (SA) paramilitary organisation, Lütge was one of many who responded by resigning from the Stahlhelm. Unlike many of the scholars who preserved their university careers through the Hitler years, Lütge never found it necessary to join The Party itself. Nevertheless, he did join the party's \"People's Welfare\" (\"Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt\" /NSV) organisation in 1934. In 1937 he joined the party's \"Teachers' League\" (\"Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund, \" / NSDDB). And in 1944 he added the , a party organisation for university academics, to his portfolio of memberships.\n\nIn January 1936 he received his habilitation degree from the University of Jena, which opened the way to a university teaching career in respect of and Economic history. Because of the amount of relevant research work that he had already undertaken he was awarded the habilitation without any requirement to write a habilitation-dissertation. The faculty deemed the two dissertations he had already completed in respect of his doctorates sufficient. Receipt of his was delayed till the next year due to differences with government authorities. There is speculation that he only received it at all because of his longstanding personal friendship with the nationally respected economist who at this stage was still a committed party member (though he would later be executed by hanging). In 1937 Lütge began working as a teacher in his disciplines at the Jena University Law and Economics faculties.\n\nIn 1940 Lütge was offered and accepted a junior professorship in , with a particular focus on at the \"Handelshochschule Leipzig\" (HHL / \"loosely, \"Commercial academy\"\") - as it was known at that time, in Leipzig. He had already been taking a quasi-scientific approach to the housing issues which was at the time innovative. His specialities included housing-market pricing and statistics. In 1940, the year of his appointment, he was in a position to publish a systematic introduction to , which was republished in 1949. it can be seen as the first comprehensive academic monograph on the subject. He was conscripted into the army in August 1941, but was released on health grounds in May 1943 after being assessed as unsuitable for service on account of a spinal condition. He returned to the Leipzig and was promoted to a full professorship. Jointly with he took on responsibility for the annual production of the . The compendium was banned in 1944 but returned, still produced by Lütge and Preise, in 1949.\n\nWar ended in May 1945 and the western two thirds of what had been Germany was divided into four military occupation zones. Leipzig had been liberated from National Socialism in April 1945 by the US army, but a different division of Germany had already been agreed between the leaders of the victorious powers whereby Leipzig should be administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone. The American military commanders agreed that Friedrich Lütge, as a \"non-party comrade\" and a member of the anti-Nazi Confessing church should be appointed post-war rector of the \"Hochschule für Wirtschaftswissenschaften \"(\"Commercial academy\"\") as it was by now known. There were additional curatorial responsibilities. When the American troops withdrew from Leipzig in July 1945 the Soviet commanders who moved in were content to confirm his appointment. In 1946 the academy was merged into the University Faculty for Economics and Social Sciences and Lütge, now on the Leipzig university payroll, was appointed dean.\n\nLütge was no fan of Communism. He characterised the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party as \"warring brothers from the same root\" (\"feindliche Brüder des gleichen Stammes\") He therefore did what he could to resist state mandated appointments of party-line goal oriented Marxist professors to his faculty. That led to accusations that he was trying to block denazification and to protect Nazis. The university nominated him to take over as dean of their new social sciences faculty but the then rejected the appointment because of his political stance. Before his position could become any more difficult, in September 1946 Lütge accepted a chair in political economics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and relocated to the US occupation zone (after May 1949 part of West Germany) to take up his new position. The Munich job also came with directorship of the Economic History Seminar that had been created at the university by back in the 1920s. \n\nFriedrich Lütge took up his teaching chair at Munich in 1946 or 1947.. The next year his colleague , Munich's Professor of Economic History, left to take up a new position and Lütge took on his former colleague's discipline, now in charge of both the Institute and that of the university Institute for Economic History. Meanwhile, in the Soviet occupation zone (relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic / East Germany)) Lütge's 1940 book, \"Kriegsprobleme der Wohnungswirtschaft\" was consigned to the official .\n\nAlongside his duties at the university he also taught at the Technical University of Munich and at the city's then separate \"University for Politics\" (\"Hochschule für Politik München\"). That was the context in which his 1948 book \"Einführung in die Lehre vom Gelde\" (\"loosely, \"Introduction to the Doctrine of Money\"\") appeared. He had already, while still at Leipzig, highlighted the unique nature of historical landlord and tenant relationships in Bavaria, and in 1949 he published the resulting study under the title \"Die bayerische Grundherrschaft – Untersuchungen über die Agrarverfassung Altbayerns im 16.–18. Jahrhundert.\" (\"loosely \"Bavarian Manorialism - Investigations into the agrarian constitutional structures in old Bavaria during the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\"\"). In addition to these agrarian historical themes, Lütge's postwar research scope covered trade and commerce, notably in protestant Nuremberg.\n\nHe also re-evaluated conventional definitions of western historical periods through the prisms of economic and agrarian history, both in writing and in lectures, which gave rise to lively discussions between experts. In 1949 German Historians' Day took place at Munich and Lütge took the opportunity to set out his thesis that the Black Death which reached Europe between 1346 and 1350, and the ensuing changes in economic and political power balances that ensued as a result of depopulation, made 1350 a much more plausible starting point for \"Modern history\" than 1500 which then (as now) was widely - often unquestioningly - identified as the starting point for the modern era in European history. The next year he set out the contention in greater detail in the newly redesigned and relaunched . He challenged another historians' shibboleth in 1958 when he argued that the decades directly preceding the Thirty Years' War had not been a period of slow decline, marked by a succession of poor harvests in Europe, as widely believed, but that it was only the outbreak of hostilities in 1618 that put an end to several decades of dynamic economic development.\n\nIn 1960 he received an invitation, which in the end he turned down, to take a professorship in Economic History at the University of Cologne. This triggered a negotiation with his own university in Munich which led to a re-assignment of teaching responsibilities that corresponded more closely with the reality of what was already happening. At the same time his \"Seminar for Economic History\" was extended in scope and elevated in status, becoming the university \"Institute for Social and Economic History\". \n\nIn 1967 he published in a single volume a synthesis from his various regional studies concerning German from the early middle ages till the in the eighteenth/nineteenth centuries. This appeared as Volume 3 of the \"Deutschen Agrargeschichte\" (\"On German Agrarian History\") series produced by (which would eventually extend to 40 volumes). Back in 1952 he had already published \"Deutschen Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte\" (\"German Social and Economic History\") which provides a multi-faceted overview of his entire research scope, and a widely used textbook which in some ways represents his most important contribution to historiography. New reworked editions appeared in 1960 and 1966.\n\nIn 1967/68 Friedrich Lütge succeeded in obtaining funding for a second teaching chair in Economic and Social History at Munich. was invited to fill it. Friedrich Lütge himself was by this point seriously ill. He died on 25 August 1968. He was succeeded at Munich by Knut Borchardt. \n\nFrom 1955 Friedrich Lütge was a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Munich. In addition, in 1966 he became a corresponding member of the Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium. At the Munich academy he initiated the establishment of a commission for social and economic history, the committee of which he then chaired. On 18 February 1961 the \"Gesellschaft für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte\" (GSWG - \"Society for Social and Economic History\") was founded. Lütge was key to its creation. Till his death he served as its first chairman. Since 2005 the GSWG has awarded a Friedrich Lütge Prize every two years \"for outstanding dissertations on Social and Economic History\". Lütge also headed up the Economic History committee of the \"German Economic Association (\"Verein für Socialpolitik\")\" between 1958 and 1962.\n\nIn 1943 Lütge teamed up with to launch the \"Quellen und Forschungen zur Agrargeschichte\" (\"Sources and Research in Agrarian History\") series at . The times were not propitious, but after the war, joined by Wilhelm Abel, they made a success of the initiative. At the same publishing house Lütge launched another series, \"Forschungen zur Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte\" (\"Researches into Social and Economic Hostory\") in 1959.\n\nAdditionally, from the last part of 1943, together with he became co-producer of the annual , on which he had previously worked under the direction of , securing the publication's future through a difficult period. After Preiser died in August 1967, Lütge became sole producer of it, but his illness forced him out in May 1968. He seriously considered renaming the Jahrbücher as \"Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Wirtschaftsgeschichte\" (\"loosely \"Year books of National Economy and Economic History\"\") in order more accurately to reflect the interdisciplinary approach taken under his stewardship, but that name change never happened. In 1953 he also became one of the co-producers of the .\n"}
{"id": "157654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=157654", "title": "Guibert of Nogent", "text": "Guibert of Nogent\n\nGuibert de Nogent (c. 1055–1124) was a Benedictine historian, theologian and author of autobiographical memoirs. Guibert was relatively unknown in his own time, going virtually unmentioned by his contemporaries. He has only recently caught the attention of scholars who have been more interested in his extensive autobiographical memoirs and personality which provide insight into medieval life.\n\nGuibert was born of parents from the minor nobility at Clermont-en-Beauvaisis. Guibert claims that it took his parents over seven years to conceive, as he writes in his \"Monodiae\". According to his memoirs, the labour nearly cost him and his mother their lives, as Guibert turned around in the womb. Guibert's family made an offering to a shrine of the Virgin Mary, and promised that if Guibert survived, he would be dedicated to a clerical life. Since he survived, he followed this path. His father was violent, unfaithful and prone to excess, and was captured at the Battle of Mortemer, dying eight months later. In his memoirs, Guibert views his death as a type of blessing, stating that if his father had survived, he likely would have forced Guibert to become a knight, thus breaking the oath to the Virgin Mary to dedicate Guibert to the church. His mother was domineering, of great beauty and intelligence, and exceedingly zealous. Guibert writes so much about his mother, and in such detail, that some scholars, such as Archambault, have suggested that he may have had an Oedipus complex. She assumed control of his education, isolated him from his peers and hired him a private tutor, from the ages of six to twelve. Guibert remembers the tutor as brutally exacting, and incompetent; nevertheless Guibert and his tutor developed a strong bond. When Guibert was around the age of twelve, his mother retired to an abbey near Saint-Germer-de-Fly (or Flay), and he soon followed. Entering the Order at St. Germer, he studied with great zeal, devoting himself at first to the secular poets Ovid and Virgil—an experience which left its imprint on his works. He later changed his focus to theology, through the influence of Anselm of Bec, who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nIn 1104, he was chosen abbot of the poor and tiny abbey of Nogent-sous-Coucy (founded 1059) and henceforth took a more prominent part in ecclesiastical affairs, where he came into contact with bishops and court society. More importantly, it gave him time to engage in his passion for writing. His first major work of this period is his history of the First Crusade called \"Dei gesta per Francos\" (\"God's deeds through the Franks\"), finished in 1108 and touched up in 1121. The history is largely a paraphrase, in ornate style, of the \"Gesta Francorum\" of an anonymous Norman author; Crusade historians have traditionally not given it favourable reviews; the fact that he stays so close to \"Gesta Francorum\", and the difficulty of his Latin, make it seem superfluous. Recent editors and translators, however, have called attention to his excellent writing and original material. More importantly, the \"Dei gesta\" supplies us with invaluable information about the reception of the crusade in France. Guibert personally knew crusaders, had grown up with crusaders, and talked with them about their memories and experiences.\n\nFor the modern reader, his autobiography (\"De vita sua sive monodiarum suarum libri tres\"), or \"Monodiae\" (\"Solitary Songs\", commonly referred to as his \"Memoirs\"), written in 1115, is considered the most interesting of his works. Written towards the close of his life, and based on the model of the \"Confessions\" of Saint Augustine, he traces his life from his childhood to adulthood. Throughout, he gives picturesque glimpses of his time and the customs of his country. The text is divided into three \"Books.\" The first covers his own life, from birth to adulthood; the second is a brief history of his monastery; the third is a description of an uprising in nearby Laon. He provides invaluable information on daily life in castles and monasteries, on the educational methods then in vogue, and gives insights into some of the major and minor personalities of his time. His work is coloured by his passions and prejudices, which add a personal touch to the work.\n\nFor example, he was quite sceptical about the propriety of Catholic relics of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and numerous Catholic saints, and entertained doubts about their authenticity, noting that some shrines and pilgrimage sites made conflicting claims about which bodily remnants, clothing or other sacred objects were held at which site.\n\n\n"}

He was a lieutenant ranked veteran of World War II. By his political views Järv was an anarcho-syndicalist.\n\nJärv was born in a farmer's family in Western Finnish municipality of Korsholm. After graduating from high school in Vaasa Järv went to sea at the age of 18. As the Winter War broke out on November 1939 he enlisted in the Finnish Army as a volunteer. Later at World War II Järv was a platoon leader in the 61st Infantry Regiment that consisted almost exclusively of Swedish-speaking Finns. He was a member of patrol unit, leading recon and combat patrols behind the enemy lines. On September 1943 Järv was seriously wounded by a landmine and he spent rest of the war at Saint Göran Hospital in Stockholm.\n\nJärv carried a camera through the war and took a plenty of pictures that were later published in his books. The 2004 Finnish war film \"Beyond the Front Line\" is based on Järv's diaries. In 1945 Järv helped his former superior Alpo Marttinen flee Finland to Sweden, although Järv said he didn't like Marttinen as a person. Colonel Marttinen, who later joined the United States Army, was involved with the Weapons Cache Case.\n\nAfter the war was over, Järv received a scholarship from Uppsala University and moved to Sweden where he spent the rest of his life. Järv had a great interest in reading and collecting books since his childhood. Järv's personal library had more than 14,000 copies. He worked as a librarian and later as a deputy director at the National Library of Sweden.\n\nIn 1973 Järv was awarded an Honorary degree by Uppsala University. He was also a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities. Järv wrote and translated more than 50 books as well as dozens of articles in various publications. His own books were mostly an essay collections of Ancient history, politics and philosophy. Järv was the Editor-in-chief in Swedish culture magazines \"Horisont\", \"Radix\" and \"Fenix\" and was known as an eminent expert on Franz Kafka.\n\nJärv was first introduced to anarchist ideas as a teenager by the books of Peter Kropotkin. On his time at the sea Järv was influenced by Finnish syndicalist Niilo Wälläri who was the leader of Finnish Seamen’s Union. During the war Järv suited anarchist ideas on his role as a platoon leader. Järv treated his men equally to himself and the decisions were made democratically. This often led to conflicts with his superior officers and Järv was considered as \"unmilitary\". In 1952 Järv joined the Swedish anarcho-syndicalist union SAC and started writing articles in its newspaper \"Arbetaren\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "236975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236975", "title": "Interview", "text": "Interview\n\nAn interview is a conversation where questions are asked and answers are given. In common parlance, the word \"interview\" refers to a one-on-one conversation between an \"interviewer\" and an \"interviewee\". The interviewer asks questions to which the interviewee responds, usually so information may be transferred from interviewee to interviewer (and any other audience of the interview). Sometimes, information can be transferred in both directions. communication, unlike a speech, which produces a one-way flow of information.\n\nInterviews usually take place face to face and in person, although modern communications technologies such as the Internet have enabled conversations to happen in which parties are separated geographically, such as with videoconferencing software, and telephone interviews can happen without visual contact. Interviews almost always involve spoken conversation between two or more parties, although in some instances a \"conversation\" can happen between two persons who type questions and answers back and forth. Interviews can range from unstructured or free-wheeling and open-ended conversations in which there is no predetermined plan with prearranged questions, to highly structured conversations in which specific questions occur in a specified order. They can follow diverse formats; for example, in a ladder interview, a respondent's answers typically guide subsequent interviews, with the object being to explore a respondent's subconscious motives. Typically the interviewer has some way of recording the information that is gleaned from the interviewee, often by writing with a pencil and paper, sometimes transcribing with a video or audio recorder, depending on the context and extent of information and the length of the interview. Interviews have a duration in time, in the sense that the interview has a beginning and an ending.\n\nThe traditional two-person interview format, sometimes called a one-on-one interview, permits direct questions and followups, which enables an interviewer to better gauge the accuracy of responses. It is a flexible arrangement in the sense that subsequent questions can be tailored to clarify earlier answers. Further, it eliminates any possible distortion by having third parties present.\n\nFace to face interviewing makes it easier for people to interact and form a connection, and it helps both the potential employer and potential hire who they might be interacting with. Further, face to face interview sessions can be more enjoyable.\n\nInterviews can happen in a wide variety of contexts:\n\nEmployment. Interviews in an employment context are typically called job interviews which describe a formal consultation for the purpose of evaluating the qualifications of the interviewee for a specific position. Interviews are seen as a useful tool in assessing qualifications. A specific type of job interview is a case interview in which the applicant is presented with a question or task or challenge, and asked to resolve the situation. Sometimes to prepare for job interviews, candidates are treated to a mock interview as a training exercise to prepare the respondent to handle questions in the subsequent 'real' interview. Sometimes the interviews happen in several waves, with the first interview sometimes being called a \"screening interview\" which is a shorter length interview, followed by more in-depth interviews later on, usually by company personnel who can ultimately hire the applicant. Technology has enabled new possibilities for interviewing; for example, video phoning technology has enabled applicants to interview for jobs despite being in different cities or countries than the interviewer. \n\nPsychology. Psychologists use a variety of interviewing methods and techniques to try to understand and help their patients. In a psychiatric interview, a psychiatrist or psychologist or nurse asks a battery of questions to complete what is called a psychiatric assessment. Sometimes two people are interviewed by an interviewer, with one format being called couple interviews. Criminologists and detectives sometimes use cognitive interviews on eyewitnesses and victims to try to ascertain what can be recalled specifically from a crime scene, hopefully before the specific memories begin to fade in the mind.\n\nResearch. In marketing research and academic research, interviews are used in a wide variety of ways. Interviews are often used in qualitative research in which firms try to understand how consumers think. Consumer research firms sometimes use computer-assisted telephone interviewing to randomly dial phone numbers to conduct highly structured telephone interviews, with scripted questions and responses entered directly into the computer.\n\nJournalism and other media. Typically, reporters covering a story in journalism conduct interviews over the phone and in person to gain information for subsequent publication. Reporters can interview political candidates on television shows. In a talk show, a radio or television \"host\" interviews one or more people, with the choice of topic usually being chosen by the host, sometimes for the purposes of entertainment, sometimes for informational purposes. Such interviews are often recorded and some of them can be released on an interview disc. \n\nOther situations. Sometimes college representatives or alumni conduct college interviews with prospective students as a way of assessing a student's suitability while offering the student a chance to learn more about a college. Some services specialize in coaching people for interviews. Embassy officials may conduct interviews with applicants for student visas before approving their visa applications.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was extraordinarily popular in its day, and held an influence on popular theatre for over a century. Its echoes can be seen in the works of Rabelais. A number of phrases from the play became proverbs in French, and the phrase \"Let us return to our muttons\" (\"retournons à nos moutons\") even became a common English calque.\n\nIn the play there are only five characters: the title character, his wife Guillemette, a clothier named Guillaume Joceaulme, a shepherd named Thibault l’Aignelet, and finally a judge. Every character except the last is dishonest in some way, which is exploited to great effect.\n\nThe play focuses on issues including the complex emerging state structure and honesty. In total, it can be performed in approximately one hour.\n\nMaster Pierre Pathelin is a local village lawyer with no professional, formal training who has very little work, due to the emerging class of professionally trained clerks and lawyers. In order to obtain cloth to replace his and his wife's holey clothing, he visits the clothier Guillaume Joceaulme. By flattering him, Pathelin convinces the clothier — against his better judgment — to let him have six yards of fine cloth on credit. However, he promises Joceaulme that he can visit his house that day to be paid.\n\nWhen Pathelin arrives home he tells his wife Guillemette that the clothier is due to arrive home and to pretend that Pathelin has been sick in bed for almost three months. After some humorous arguments, Joceaulme barges in on Pathelin, who is in bed and raving like a madman. In time Pathelin's entertaining babble moves from one French dialect to another, which Guillemette has to explain away.\n\nAfter Joceaulme gives up on attempting to retrieve his payment, he turns his thoughts to his shepherd, Thibault l’Aignelet, who has been stealing Joceaulme's sheep and eating them for the past three years. Joceaulme summons Aignelet to court, and the latter goes to Pathelin in order to be legally represented. Pathelin directs Aignelet to say only \"Baaa\" (like a sheep) when anyone questions him in court in the hope that the judge will find Joceaulme's case groundless, as it will appear that he has taken a mentally-challenged person to court.\n\nAt the trial Joceaulme instantly recognizes Pathelin. He tries to explain the details of both cases (the stolen cloth and the stolen sheep) to the judge, but he is unable to do so clearly, and the judge conflates the two cases. Because of Joceaulme's incoherent case against the shepherd (and the latter's one word nonsense response of \"Baaa\"), the judge rules against him. Pathelin attempts to collect his fee from Aignelet, but the latter only answers Pathelin's demands with \"Baaa.\" Pathelin realizes that his brilliant defense is now being used against him, and he goes home.\n\n"}

His literary heritage is regarded to be the foundation of modern Ukrainian literature and, to a large extent, the modern Ukrainian language. Shevchenko is also known for many masterpieces as a painter and an illustrator.\n\nIn March 2014, by the 200th birth anniversary of the poet the first interactive map of sites dedicated to Taras Shevchenko was created.\n\nOn the interactive map \"The World of Shevchenko\" created by the Inter (TV channel) and information portal Podrobnosti, 1060 monuments of Kobzar, towns, villages, museums, schools, theaters named in his honor have been defined. These objects are located in 32 countries on different continents. The interactive map allows users to view monuments with a help of sight-seeing service.\n\nAmong the most notable objects commemorating Shevchenko are the symbolic kobza sculpture in Canberra, Australia's capital, graffiti of poet's portrait in Kharkiv and the memorial in Washington. The most distant objects dedicated to the poet are the monument in Beijing (distance from Kyiv is 6456 km), Shevchenko street in Khabarovsk (6900 km), memorial in Washington (7847 km), Buenos Aires (12 826 km) and Canberra (14 913 km).\n\nTaras Shevchenko has been commemorated by the naming of geographic places including:\n\n\n\nThere are many monuments to Shevchenko throughout Ukraine, most notably at his memorial in Kaniv and in the center of Kyiv, just across from the Kyiv University that bears his name. The Kyiv Metro station, Tarasa Shevchenka, is also dedicated to Shevchenko. Among other notable monuments to the poet located throughout Ukraine are the ones in Kharkiv (in front of the Shevchenko Park. Kharkiv|Shevchenko Park), Lviv, Luhansk and many others.\n\nAfter Ukraine gained its independence in the wake of the 1991 Soviet Collapse, some Ukrainian cities replaced their statues of Lenin with statues of Taras Shevchenko and in some locations that lacked streets named to him, local authorities renamed the streets or squares to Shevchenko.\n\nIn 2001, the Ukrainian society \"Prosvita\" raised the initiative of building a Church near the Chernecha Mount in Kaniv, where Taras Shevchenko is buried. The initiative got a rather supportive response in the society. Since then many charity events have been held all over the country to gather donations for the above purpose. A marathon under the slogan \"Let's Build a Church for the Kobzar\" by the First National Radio Channel of Ukraine collected 39,000 hryvnias (about US$7,500) in October 2003.\n\nOutside of Ukraine, monuments to Shevchenko have been put up in several locations of the former USSR associated with his legacy, both in the Soviet and the post-Soviet times. The modern monument in Saint Petersburg was erected on December 22, 2000, but the first monument (pictured) was built in the city in 1918 on the order of Lenin shortly after the Great Russian Revolution. There is also a monument located next to the Shevchenko museum at the square that bears the poet's name in Orsk, Russia (the location of the military garrison where the poet served) where there are also a street, a library and the Orsk Pedagogical Institute|Pedagogical Institute named to the poet. There are Shevchenko monuments and museums in the cities of Kazakhstan where he was later transferred by the military: Aqtau (the city was named \"Shevchenko\" between 1964 and 1992) and nearby Fort Shevchenko (renamed from Fort Alexandrovsky in 1939), and a street after him in Vilnius, where he also lived. T.G. Shevchenko University in Tiraspol, the capital of Transnistria, is the main university of that region.\nThere is also a bilingual Taras Sevchenko high school in Sighetu Marmatiei, Romania. A monument to Taras Shevchenko on a street that bears his name can also be found in the city centre of Tashkent, Uzbekistan.\n\nOutside of Ukraine and the former USSR, monuments to Shevchenko have been put up in many countries, usually under the initiative of local Ukrainian diasporas. There are several memorial societies and monuments to him throughout Canada and the United States. \nThe most notable American monument is the large bronze and granite monument in Washington, D.C., near Dupont Circle designed by artist Leo Mol. The carving of the granite stonework was by Vincent Illuzzi of Barre, Vermont. There is also a monument in Soyuzivka in New York State, Tipperary Hill in Syracuse, New York.\n\nA park in Elmira Heights, N.Y. and a street is named after Shevchenko in New York City's East Village. A section of Connecticut Route 9 that goes through New Britain is also named after Shevchenko.\n\nThe most notable Canadian monument is the bronze and granite statue of Taras Shevchenko in Ottawa, created by Leo Mol, and unveiled on June 26, 2011. (see Taras Shevchenko Monument Ottawa).\nThe Leo Mol sculpture garden in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, contains many images of Taras Shevchenko.\n\nA two-tonne bronze statue of Shevchenko, located in a memorial park outside of Oakville, Ontario was discovered stolen in December 2006. It was taken for scrap metal; the head was recovered in a damaged state, but the statue was not repairable. The head is on exhibit at the Taras Shevchenko Museum & Memorial Park Foundation in Toronto.\n\nA Taras Shevchenko Museum & Memorial Park Foundation is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. A video tour of the museum was created in March 2010. Among other exhibits, the video tour includes footage of Shevchenko's death mask.\n\nThere is a Shevchenko Boulevard in the Lasalle borough of Montreal, Quebec. The town of Vita in Manitoba, Canada was originally named Shevchenko in his honor.\n\nThere is a statue of Taras Shevchenko at Ukraine Square in Curitiba, Brazil.\n\nThere is a Shevchenko Square in Paris located in the heart of the central Saint-Germain-des-Prés district.\n\nThe British band New Order released a live video on Factory Records titled \"Taras Shevchenko\", recorded in 1981 at the Ukrainian National Home in the East Village of New York City; the initial scenes feature a digitised version of the Shevchenko self-portrait.

Harsgor's expertise was in the history of Europe in the late Middle Ages.\n\nHarsgor was born Michael Goldberg in Bucharest into a Jewish family who were refugees from the October Revolution in Russia who settled in Romania. Early on, Harsgor's parents had the desire to give him a Western education and therefore his family moved to France. The economic crisis of 1929 damaged his father's business and therefore in 1933 his family returned to Romania. Harsgor's family intended to immigrate to the Land of Israel but this proved impossible during World War II. His entire family perished in the Holocaust. Because he was a member of the Socialist–Zionist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair the Romanian fascist authorities sentenced him to 20 years of imprisonment with hard labor. Harsgor ended up working in the printing press of the prison. In 1944 he was released from prison, and continued to be active in the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement.\n\nIn 1946, after being active in gathering Jewish teenagers in Romania and facilitating their immigration to Palestine, he himself immigrated to Palestine. The British authorities in Palestine limited the Jewish immigration quota at that time and all the passengers on the ship taking him to Palestine were seized imprisoned in camps in Cyprus. They were released in early 1949 after the establishment of the State of Israel. In Cyprus Harsgor changed his name from Goldberg to Harsgor.\n\nHarsgor was a member of Kibbutz Zikim and was the person who gave the kibbutz its name.

For his academic achievement Harsgor was awarded the degree of Docteur d'État, a degree which is usually not awarded to foreigners. Between 1962 and 1966 Harsgor taught history in the Municipal High School Ironi D in Tel Aviv.\n\nIn 1974, Harsgor was in Lisbon during the Carnation Revolution, and as a result, the history of Portugal became one of his major topics of interest.\n\nFor more than twenty years, Harsgor hosted the regularly weekly seven o'clock evening program \"Sha'a Historit\" (History Hour) on the Galatz radio station, along with the Israeli radio broadcaster Alex Ansky.\n\nHis grandson is former deputy mayor of Kfar Saba, Ilai Harsgor Hendin.\n\nHarsgor died on 10 February 2011 at the age of 86 in the city of Kfar Saba due to kidney disease.\n\n"}

{"id": "3745308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3745308", "title": "Paleoceanography", "text": "Paleoceanography\n\nPaleoceanography is the study of the history of the oceans in the geologic past with regard to circulation, chemistry, biology, geology and patterns of sedimentation and biological productivity. Paleoceanographic studies using environment models and different proxies enable the scientific community to assess the role of the oceanic processes in the global climate by the re-construction of past climate at various intervals. Paleoceanographic research is also intimately tied to paleoclimatology.\n\nPaleoceanography makes use of so-called proxy methods as a way to infer information about the past state and evolution of the worlds oceans. Several geochemical proxy tools include long-chain organic molecules (e.g. alkenones), stable and radioactive isotopes, and trace metals. Additionally, sediment cores can also be useful; the field of paleoceanography is closely related to sedimentology and paleontology.\n\nSea-surface temperature (SST) records can be extracted from deep-sea sediment cores using oxygen isotope ratios and the ratio of magnesium to calcium (Mg/Ca) in shell secretions from plankton, from long-chain organic molecules such as alkenone, from tropical corals near the sea surface, and from mollusk shells.\n\nOxygen isotope ratios (δO) are useful in reconstructing SST because of the influence temperature has on the isotope ratio. Plankton take up oxygen in building their shells and will be less enriched in their δO when formed in warmer waters, provided they are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the seawater. When these shells precipitate, they sink and form sediments on the ocean floor whose δO can be used to infer past SSTs. Oxygen isotope ratios are not perfect proxies, however. The volume of ice trapped in continental ice sheets can have an impact of the δO. Freshwater characterized by lower values of δO becomes trapped in the continental ice sheets, so that during glacial periods seawater δO is elevated and calcite shells formed during these times will have a larger δO value.\n\nThe substitution of magnesium in place of calcium in CaCO shells can be used as a proxy for the SST in which the shells formed. Mg/Ca ratios have several other influencing factors other than temperature, such as vital effects, shell-cleaning, and postmortem and post-depositional dissolution effects, to name a few. Other influences aside, Mg/Ca ratios have successfully quantified the tropical cooling that occurred during the last glacial period.\n\nAlkenones are long-chain, complex organic molecules produced by photosynthetic algae. They are temperature sensitive and can be extracted from marine sediments. Use of alkenones represents a more direct relationship between SST and algae and does not rely on knowing biotic and physical-chemical thermodynamic relationships needed in CaCO studies. Another advantage of using alkenones is that it is a product of photosynthesis and necessitates formation in the sunlight of the upper surface layers. As such, it better records near-surface SST.\n\nThe most commonly used proxy to infer deep-sea temperature history are the Mg/Ca ratios in benthic foraminifera and ostracodes. The temperatures inferred from the Mg/Ca ratios have confirmed an up to 3 °C cooling of the deep ocean during the late Pleistocene glacial periods. One notable study is that by Lear et al. [2002] who worked to calibrate bottom water temperature to Mg/Ca ratios in 9 locations covering a variety of depths from up to six different benthic foraminifera (depending on location). The authors found an equation calibrating bottom water temperature of Mg/Ca ratios that takes on an exponential form:\n\nwhere Mg/Ca is the Mg/Ca ratio found in the benthic foraminifera and BWT is the bottom water temperature.\n\nSalinity is a more challenging quantity to infer from paleorecords. Deuterium excess in core records can provide a better inference of sea-surface salinity than oxygen isotopes, and certain species, such as diatoms, can provide a semiquantitative salinity record due to the relative abundances of diatoms that are limited to certain salinity regimes.\n\nSeveral proxy methods have been used to infer past ocean circulation and changes to it. They include carbon isotope ratios, cadmium/calcium (Cd/Ca) ratios, protactinium/thorium isotopes (Pa and Th), radiocarbon activity (δC), neodymium isotopes (Nd and Nd), and sortable silt (fraction of deep-sea sediment between 10 and 63 μm). Carbon isotope and cadmium/calcium ratio proxies are used because variability in their ratios is due partly to changes in bottom-water chemistry, which is in turn related the source of deep-water formation. These ratios, however, are influenced by biological, ecological, and geochemical processes which complicate circulation inferences.\n\nAll proxies included are useful in inferring the behavior of the meridional overturning circulation. For example, McManus et al. [2004] used protactinium/thorium isotopes (Pa and Th) to show that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation had been nearly (or completely) shut off during the last glacial period. Pa and Th are both formed from the radioactive decay of dissolved uranium in seawater, with Pa able to remain supported in the water column longer than Th: Pa has a residence time ~100–200 years while Th has one ~20–40 years. In today's Atlantic Ocean and current overturning circulation, Th transport to the Southern Ocean is minimal due to its short residence time, and Pa transport is high. This results in relatively low Pa / Th ratios found by McManus et al. [2004] in a core at 33N 57W, and a depth of 4.5 km. When the overturning circulation shuts down (as hypothesized) during glacial periods, the Pa / Th ratio becomes elevated due to the lack of removal of Pa to the Southern Ocean. McManus et al. [2004] also note a small raise in the Pa / Th ratio during the Younger Dryas event, another period in climate history thought to have experienced a weakening overturning circulation.\n\nBoron isotope ratios (δB) can be used to infer both recent as well as millennial time scale changes in the acidity, pH, and alkalinity of the ocean, which is mainly forced by atmospheric CO concentrations and bicarbonate ion concentration in the ocean. δB has been identified in corals from the southwestern Pacific to vary with ocean pH, and shows that climate variabilities such as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) can modulate the impact of ocean acidification due to rising atmospheric CO concentrations. Another application of δB in plankton shells can be used as an indirect proxy for atmospheric CO concentrations over the past several million years.\n\n"}

Before the advent of turnpikes or toll roads, ridgeway trails continued to provide the firmest and safest cart tracks. They are generally an opposite to level, valley-bottom, paved roads, which require engineering work to shore up and maintain. Unmaintained valley routes may require greater travelling distances than ridgeways.\n\nPrehistoric roads in Europe often variously comprised stretches of ridgeway above the line of springs, sections of causeway through bog and marsh, and other trackways of neither sort which crossed flat country.\n\nA revival of interest in ancient roads and recreational walking in the 19th century brought the concept back into common use. Some ancient routes, in particular The Ridgeway National Trail of southern England, have been reprised as long-distance footpaths.\n\nAlong ridge lines of hills, soil is often exposed and dry because of wind and natural drainage, and vegetation tends to be thinner. Where a beaten track evolves into a busier \"road,\" constant passage by beasts, sleds and wheeled vehicles suppresses regrowth of vegetation. With the help of rain (and soil creep), a shallow trail can be worn down into the topsoil and smoothed without any purposeful road-making work. The thin soil and rocky subsoil, combined with the natural drainage provided by the slopes on each side, also tended to keep such roads dry.\n\nIn western Europe, where prehistoric roads have been extensively documented with the help of itineraries, traces on old maps and extant marks on the landscape, ridgeways are a typical feature of long-distance ancient routes through rugged, high-rainfall parts of Germany and across the island of Great Britain. These ancient trackways generally ran along the hilltops, only descending when necessary to cross valleys.\n\nAs such, they are an opposite to modern-style roads, which tend to run along the valleys and only ascend when necessary to cross the hilltops.\n\nIn rugged parts of central Germany, ridgeways tend to strictly follow the watershed line proper, since traversing steep slopes was difficult for wheeled vehicles and uncomfortable for foot travellers unless someone had cut a track into the hillside and shored it up against washouts and slips. However, deviations around high peaks were common, usually taking the south side of the peak, presumably because the warmer side was usually drier. On flatter British hills, the line of the tracks often runs a little below the actual crest of the ridge, possibly to afford some shelter from the wind or to avoid travellers presenting themselves to marauders as a target on the skyline.\n\nThe discomfort of following ridgeways arises from their exposure to harsh weather and the fact that they are rarely level. The ridge line rises and falls. Moreover, at some point the ridge ends, so that the route must descend to ford a stream before rising again to follow the next ridge. Loads on two-wheeled carts had to be constantly shifted to the back during descents and to the front during ascents so that the animals could draw efficiently.\n\nIn medieval and later times ridgeways in England were used as drovers roads.\n\nSince ridgeways were informal routes, and the rounded tops of many British and German ridges might be hundreds of metres wide, the track might change seasonally, or spontaneously, if any land alongside the trail appeared drier and firmer. But where the tracks were seen as marking boundaries, the course could no longer change without causing a property dispute. English ridgeway routes became fixed in the course of enclosures beginning about 1750.\n\nNotable prehistoric ridgeways include:\n\nSome modern authors have suggested several advantages a ridgeway might possess: \n\nSome ridgeway routes were adopted and paved by the Romans, even though the prevailing Roman road-construction practice was to build straight roads from point to point, rising and falling with the landscape.\n\nSome German ridgeways were deliberately closed to force traffic into towns. In one instance, the central purpose of the Rheingauer Gebück, a 38-kilometre fence erected in the 12th century, may have been to close down a German ridgeway and force traffic onto the Rhine river. Many ridgeways have continued in use with macadam or paved surfaces in modern times. Others fell into disuse when more level paved routes, either along valley bottoms or cut transversely along hillsides, were built parallel to them.\n\nNoting the existence of such parallel routes, antiquarians in Britain came to associate ridgeways culturally with ancient Britons. However the evidence for the great antiquity of ridgeway routes is ambiguous. In the modern era, new cart tracks have generally avoided inhospitable high ground: the 1840s and 1850s Wagon Trails from the Missouri River to Oregon and California — rutted trails in bare earth — generally followed low courses.\n\nIn Britain, the term \"ridgeway\" has been in continuous use since Anglo-Saxon times \nas a generic term to distinguish any high travel route from a lower one. The earliest extant written form is spelled \"hrycweg\", dating from 938. In German, a variety of terms of similar date match the concept of a ridgeway: \"Rennweg\" (since circa 860: \"Rennewec\"), \"Rennstieg\" (1162: \"Rinnestich\"), \"Bergstrasse\" (C9: \"Birgistrotun\") and \"hohe Strasse\" (circa 1000 \"Howestraze\").\n\nA revival of interest in ancient roads in the 19th century brought the concept back into common use. Although the Great Ridgeway northwest of London was the best known of such routes, 19th-century British antiquarians rediscovered numerous other local ridgeways and speculated that names such as Ryknild Street (a valley route) contained the word ridge in modified form. Scholars such as Georg Landau (1807–1865) began mapping and walking ancient ridgeway roads across Germany in the 19th century.\n\nRecording prehistoric ridgeways today can be difficult. Trails only lightly worn into soil along ridge lines are generally no longer visible, but their courses are sometimes marked by modern roads and footpaths that have perpetuated the ridgeway routes.\n\nA ridgeway previously used by carts often remains physically evident in the form of a hollow way: a trench or fosse eroded deep into the soil by constant passage of wheels and hooves. These are most common at inclines. Sleds, axles scraping the soil between wheel ruts, locked wheels skidding downhill and heavy weights dragged over the ground to brake the carts' descents would all continue eroding the surface down to the bedrock, if any, which then forms a natural pavement.\n\nWhen it rains, the mud and debris in an inclined hollow way tend to be washed down the channel, slowly flushing it out and leaving banks on either side where hedgerows may develop and collect more material. Hollow ways can of course occur in any firm-ground trackway, not just in ridgeway sections. On level sections of a ridgeway, banks are less common' perhaps because travellers avoided large puddles and constantly changed the courses, or because any banks eroded.\n\nFrom the 19th century onwards, old ridgeways which had not been converted into highways were often revived by hiking clubs or tourism authorities, marked out as scenic trails for walking, horse-riding or mountain biking far from the disturbances of motor traffic. An 1890 Baedeker guide recommended walks on The Ridgeway, and efforts to give that ridgeway legislative recognition began in 1947.\n\nSome completely new recreational ridgeways have been devised where there was no tradition of the route being used for trade in previous centuries. \nExamples include the \"Kammweg\" established in 1904 in eastern Germany and the 197-kilometre Wessex Ridgeway in England, devised in the 1980s by the Ramblers Association, following ridges between the Atlantic coast and Avebury, with a preference for firm paths, good scenery and free access.\n\n\n"}

At the behest of his uncle, a monk at Saint-Léger-de-Champeaux, Glaber was sent to a monastery at the age of twelve, but he was eventually expelled for disobedience. Later he spent time in various other monastaries, such as Moutiers-Saint-Jean, Saint-Bénigne à Dijon, and Saint-Germain d'Auxerre.\n\nAround the year 1010 he joined the monastery of St. Benignus near Dijon where he met a reform-minded cleric from Piedmont, William of Volpiano, Abbot of Saint-Bénigne. In 1028 he traveled to Italy with Volpiano, who encouraged him write what would become his masterpiece, the \"Historiarum libri quinque ab anno incarnationis DCCCC usque ad annum MXLIV\" (\"History in five books from 900 AD to 1044 AD\"). The chronicle was dedicated to the Abbot of Cluny, Odilo. Today a few manuscripts of the \"Historiarum\" survive, including the author's original copy. As a second work, Rodulfus wrote a biography of Volpiano, which probably arose shortly after his death in 1031. That year, he moved to the Abbey of Cluny, which was headed by Abbot Odilon de Mercœur. In 1039 he joined the Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre, where he remained until his death.\n\nGlaber is credited with coining the phrase \"white mantle of churches\", describing the ubiquity of religious architecture of the times.\n\nGlaber is best known for \"Historiarum\", which he is believed to have started writing during his time at the Abbey of Cluny around 1026 or so, and completed at Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre some time later. Initially intended to be an ecclesiastical history, Glaber's focus is on events in the center of France, but occasionally ranges as far as Scotland and Southern Italy.\n\nGlaber's writings often sympathized with proponents of church reform of that age, including Henry II, Henry III, and Robert II of France, while criticizing others like Conrad II, and Pope Benedict IX. As a source of events, the work is of limited value due to its chronological and geographic inadequacy, but it is significant as a cultural history document for morality and customs of the 11th century.\n\nHe also wrote a hagiography of William of Volpiano, the \"Vita Sancti Guillelmi Abbatis Divionensis.\"\n\nLarge extracts from his works are cited and discussed in \"The Year 1000\", by French author Georges Duby. \"Historiarum\" was first published in 1596 from a manuscript owned by Pierre Pithou, as part of a collection of eleven medieval chronicles.\n\n\n"}

He was the professor at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law (1897—1940), Rector of the University of Belgrade (1913-14 and 1920-21), and the President of the Serbian Royal Academy (1928–1931). He took part at the Paris Peace Conference (1919) as an expert for the Yugoslav Government.\n\nJovanović was the Deputy Prime Minister (March 1941 - June 1942) and the Prime Minister of the Royal Yugoslav government-in-exile in London between January 1942 and June 1943. After the World War II, new Communist authorities of Yugoslavia sentenced him in absentia to 20 years in prison. Jovanović remained at liberty for the rest of his life in London.\n\nSlobodan Jovanović was born in Novi Sad, then part of Austria-Hungary (present-day Serbia) on 3 December 1869 to Vladimir Jovanović and his wife Jelena. He was reportedly the first Serbian male to be named \"Slobodan\" (\"sloboda\" means \"freedom\" in Serbian), while his sister was named Pravda (\"Justice\"). He received an excellent education in Belgrade, Munich, Zurich, and Geneva, where he graduated with a law degree. From 1890 to 1892, he took post-graduate studies in constitutional law and political science in Paris before entering the Serbian foreign service. In 1893 he was appointed political attaché with the Serbian mission to Constantinople, where he remained for a couple years. It was at this time that he began to write and have his articles on literary criticism published in various publications throughout the land. \n\nHe eventually left the diplomatic service in favour of academia and literary pursuits. In 1897 he was appointed professor at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law. For more than four decades, Jovanović taught at the law faculty gaining a reputation as an authority on constitutional law and Serbian language and literature. He was Rector of the University of Belgrade in two separate occasions. Jovanović joined the Serbian Royal Academy in 1908, and was its President from 1928 to 1931. He was also a correspondent member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb from 1927.\n\nJovanović had some influence on political life in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia due to his well established authority in the field of law and history, but he entered directly political life only in 1939 when the Serbian Cultural Club was established, and he was appointed as Club's president.\n\nHe was a pro-Western politician and when a pro-Western military coup took place in Belgrade on 27 March 1941, a pro-Western, essentially pro-British government was installed headed by General Dušan Simović. Jovanović was deputy Prime Minister in that government. The Third Reich attacked the Kingdoms of Yugoslavia and Greece on 6 April, and soon defeated Yugoslav and Greek forces. Jovanović moved in mid April together with King Peter II and other cabinet ministers to Jerusalem and he reached London in July. He became prime minister of the Yugoslav government-in-exile during World War II on 11 January 1942 and remained in that position until 26 June 1943. \n\nTried in absence in Josip Broz Tito's communist state together with general Draža Mihailović, he was sentenced to 20 years in jail which he never served, as well as the loss of political and civil rights for a period of ten years, and confiscation of all property and loss of citizenship. He spent his later years in exile in London (1945–1958). A memorial plaque in honour of \"Professor Slobodan Yovanovitch. Serbian historian, literary critic, legal scholar, Prime Minister of Yugoslavia\" may be found in London at 39b Queen's Gate Gardens, Kensington.\n\nAfter unofficial rehabilitation in 1989, his collected works were published in 1991. In Serbia, he is regarded as one of the most influential political thinkers of the turn of the century. Leading Serbian journal Politika on the occasion of his 70th birthday concluded that \"his name has been carved as the highest peak of our culture up to now\".\n\nHis collected works were published in 17 volumes in 1939–1940. It contains the results of his unremitting labour as a writer, professor and politician for sixty years, and throws considerable light on Balkan history of the first half of the 20th century, as well as on the author himself. Although his works were not officially banned, any new issue of his books was not permitted in communist Yugoslavia until the late 1980s. Finally, a new edition of his collected works was published in Belgrade in 12 volumes in 1991. \n\nSince 2003 his portrait has appeared on the 5000 dinar banknote, and his bust stands at the Faculty of Law in Belgrade. His official rehabilitation occurred on 26 October 2007 by a Belgrade court. Since 10 December 2011, plateau in front of Faculty of Law in Belgrade bears his name.\n\n\n\n"}

All of his eight books have won literary prizes. His first three were travel books based on his journeys in the Middle East, India and Central Asia. His early influences included travel writers such as Robert Byron, Eric Newby, and Bruce Chatwin. More recently, Dalrymple published a book of essays about current affairs in the Indian Subcontinent, and two award-winning histories of the interaction between the British and the Mughals between the eighteenth and mid nineteenth century.
