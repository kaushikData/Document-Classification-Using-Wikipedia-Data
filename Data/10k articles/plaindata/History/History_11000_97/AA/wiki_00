Before the rebellion, the theatre was controlled by the managers Theophilus Cibber, John Ellys, and John Highmore. When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run the theatre, he, along with other actors, attempted to take over the theatre by controlling the lease. When the shareholders found out, they refused to admit the actors to the building and the theatre was closed for several months. The fight spilled over to the contemporary newspapers, which generally sided with the managers.\n\nThe Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a new company of actors, though they were less experienced and talented than the old crew. The majority of old actors moved to the Little Theatre, Haymarket, though a few remained loyal. Henry Fielding sided with the managers and produced several plays to aid the Theatre Royal, though this caused a backlash when the rebelling actors finally won the dispute. By the end of 1733, the rebellious actors managed to seize legal control of the theatre's property and Highmore, the sole manager of the Theatre Royal at the time, lost all legal abilities to stop them. By February 1734, he sold his shares to Charles Fleetwood who then made an agreement with the actors that secured their return.\n\nThe Theatre Royal, Drury Lane was run by the holders of one of the two official licenses, or letters patent, established by Charles II in 1660. It was operated by Christopher Rich from 1693 until 1714. He was replaced after his death by three actors, Colley Cibber, Thomas Doggett, and Robert Wilks. After Doggett died, Barton Booth took over his share. In 1730, a notice in the \"Daily Journal\" stated that a patent would be issued to Booth, Cibber, and Wilks authorising the official government license to run the Theatre Royal. After bureaucratic delays, the official patent was given to the three managers only in 1732 that was to last for 21 years. On 13 July 1732, Booth, in poor health, decided to sell half of his share to Highmore, a fellow actor and a socialite. On 27 September, Wilks died and his share was inherited by his widow, who then authorised Ellys, a painter, to serve in her place. In reaction to the changing partners, Colley Cibber rented his share to his son Theophilus, an actor.\n\nThe new management group had two members, Highmore and Ellys, who were incompetent and Theophilus Cibber was known to be both arrogant and volatile. By the end of 1732, there were problems with the management of the theatre, which resulted in the failure of Charles Johnson's \"Caelia: or, The Perjured Lover\" on 4 December. The 8 March 1733 \"Grub-Street Journal\" seized on the event and used the failure to criticise the theatre's management: \"how insufficient the present managers of Drury-lane playhouse are to discharge their trust, as directors of our public entertainments.\" The newspaper was not the only group concerned and many plays were soon cancelled.\n\nMatters were complicated by mass illnesses spreading across London; the epidemic, probably flu, reduced the number of actors able to work and many plays were cancelled. Even Henry Fielding's play \"The Miser\", which was to open early January, was postponed because of the poor health of its cast members, including Theophilus. \"The Miser\" was eventually staged in mid February and was successful, but another of his plays, \"Deborah: or, a Wife for You All\", lasted only one night on 6 April 1733. Regardless of the problems plaguing the season, it was positive for Fielding while it lasted, with six of his plays being produced on stage along with Thomas Arne's \"The Opera of Operas\", Fielding's \"Tom Thumb\" set to music.\n\nHighmore and Ellys, both gentlemen and not actors, insisted on actively participating in every day-to-day decisions regarding scheduling, choice of plays, expenses, actors' behaviour. Their management style clashed with Theophilus, when he recovered and returned in February. They denied his play \"The Harlot's Progress\" instead putting a play by Ellys. The fighting between the managers coincided with poor attendance from both the epidemic in London and other theatres attracting audiences with popular operatic performances. Theophilus's play \"The Mock-Officer\" failed, which caused Highmore and Ellys to turn further against him. However, his 31 March 1733 \"The Harlot's Progress\", based on William Hogarth's painting of the same name, proved to be very successful and embarrassed the two other managers.\n\nWhile Theophilus Cibber was disputing with Highmore and Ellys, Aaron Hill became interested in partnering at the Theatre Royal. Hill was earlier a partner at the theatre until he was removed during a previous actor riot that took place in June 1710. On 22 March 1733, Hill, in a letter to Benjamin Victor, a dramatist who had arranged the sale of Booth's shares to Highmore, criticised the fact that he was kept from buying into the theatre's management and attacked Theophilus. He offered 900 pounds for three years for Booth's shares and 1800 pounds for Mary Wilks's shares. Negotiations continued until May when they were dropped. Hester Booth, widow of Barton Booth, sold her remaining shares to Henry Giffard, the manager of Goodman's Fields Theatre, just few days after her husband died on 10 May.\n\nBy this time, many of the partners, including Wilks, Ellys, and Colley Cibber, no longer wanted to be a part of the theatre and sought to sell their shares. When Colley sought to rent out his share to his son for 300 pounds a year, Highmore approached Colley in order to buy. News of Colley's selling of the shares to Highmore first appeared in the \"Daily Post\" of 27 March 1733. The sale price was around 3000 guineas and 3500 pounds. Theophilus was upset that his father sold the share to Highmore instead of continuing to rent it out to himself. The share, as Theophilus believed, was his \"Birthright\".\n\nTheophilus first tried to work with Highmore and asked to run the operations of the theatre. However, he was turned down, which provoked him to stir the actors into a rebellion. Many of the actors were upset about the management changes and theatre's operations. Highmore did not have experience in theatre, refused to listen to actors' ideas, and cut their salaries in half. Theophilus was known as a successful manager and a good actor. The rebellious actors' plan was to take over the lease and then deny the use of the building to the shareholders, who did not own the complex that they set their stage in. The actors would then use their control over the building to negotiate renting of the patent so they could control how the theatre was run.\n\nWhen the actors tried to rent the building, the remaining shareholders found out about it. They responded by refusing admittance to the actors. The building was shut down and no plays were performed. According to the \"Daily Post\" of 29 May 1733:\nThe actors petitioned Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, the Lord Chamberlain, and requested that he settle the dispute, but he refused to involve himself in the matter. By early June, the actors had control of the theatre through the lease, but the management refused to leave. The actors tried to file for the management to be legally removed from the property, but the court system was slow to respond.\n\nThe management continued to cause problems for various actors, including Benjamin Griffin. Griffin was fired from the theatre on 4 June 1733. He responded in the \"Daily Post\" on 11 June 1733 with a history of the events since he first started in 1721 until his removal. He accused the management of bad treatment and wrote:\nI could give the Publick a great many Instances of the \"Gentlemen's\" Mismanagement and of Injuries done to the Company this Season in their Direction. But when I affirm that they have no Experience, no Knowledge, no Capacity, \"For Gathering together, Forming, Entertaining, Governing, Privileging, and Keeping a Company of Comedians\" ... more than the being able to purchase the \"Patent\" [...] it is a Truth that if any one does not now believe, I am positive that they will in a very little Time be thoroughly convinced of.\n\nMany of the local newspapers were quick to respond to the rebellion. An article in \"The Craftsman\" dated 2 June 1733 described the actors as \"malecontent Players\" who were busy in mutiny. On 7 June, the \"Grub-Street Journal\" stated, in an article by Musaeus, that Theophilus was selfish. Another article in the \"Grub-Street Journal\", by Philo Dramaticus, attacked the management for not understanding how theatres are supposed to work. The managers were the first to state their defence and argued that everything they did was correct and that the actors had no reason to complain, especially over the treatment that they received.\n\nThe actors responded later in June with \"A Letter from Theophilus Cibber, , To John Highmore, Esq\". Within the response, Theophilus Cibber emphasised the inability of the management to effectively run the theatre, claimed that they were acting like tyrants, and alleged that they unjustly refused the offer by the actors to rent out the patent. This did not calm the dispute; instead, the \"Grub-Street Journal\" of 14 June 1733 printed parts of John Vanbrugh's \"Aesop\", a play that criticised the actor rebellion that took place in 1695. On 26 June, the \"Grub-Street Journal\" in an article by Musaeus claimed that many of the problems that the actors complained about were caused by previous managers, who were also actors, and not by the current management that was composed of outsiders. Additionally, Musaeus claimed that actors in general were unfit to run the theatre.\n\nA pamphlet titled \"An Impartial State of the Present Dispute Between the Patent and Players\" was published during the late summer that attacked the actors. It claimed that \"all Men of Sense and Integrity seem to be entirely convinced that the \"Patentees\" of the \"Theatre-Royal\" in \"Drury-Lane\", have had great Injustice done them by the late Attempt of Part of their own Company to defraud them of their Property\". The actors responded in an article published in the \"Daily Journal\" of 26 September. Also during the summer, Edward Phillips produced \"The Stage-Mutineers\", a play that started on 27 July and ran for twelve nights. The play made fun of actors, writers, and the management as a whole. Even though it was attacked in the \"Grub-Street Journal\" of 9 August, theatre historian Robert Hume described the play as \"harmless stuff\". Regardless, Fielding was personally mocked as Crambo, one of the characters within the play, and was offended by the portrayal.\n\nThe Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a new company of actors. The majority of the rebellious actors joined the Little Theatre in Haymarket and started producing plays on 26 September. Although the Theatre Royal had replacement actors of a lesser talent and a few loyal experienced members, Henry Fielding joined the management's side of the dispute. Of the 15 loyal actors that stayed with the Theatre Royal, only a few, including Kitty Clive, Christiana Horton, William Mullart, and Charles Stoppelaer, were of note. Reportedly, Highmore was losing 50–60 pounds a week. Victor, in his account of the time, wrote:\nIn this maimed Condition the Business of Course went lamely on; for a very middling Company of Players could be expected to bring but thin losing Audiences, especially while Party prevailed, and those very Plays were acted much better in the \"Haymarket\". The unavoidable and melancholy Consequence of this Proceeding was, that there was a Ballance every \"Saturday\" Morning in the Office against the Manager, of Fifty or Sixty Pounds; and his Pride, as well as his Honour, were too nearly concerned not to prudence the Deficiency every Week with the utmost Exactness.\nIn such conditions, Giffard sold his shares and turned over full control of the theatre to Highmore. Hill was brought in to work with the actors at Drury Lane by Autumn 1733, but the theatre was still declining by the end of the year.\nIn order to aid the theatre, Fielding revised his \"The Author's Farce\" and \"The Intriguing Chambermaid\". Fielding's \"The Miser\" was also put on 27 October 1733 with the King, the Queen, and many noble families in attendance. After this, Fielding produced \"The Universal Gallant: or, The Different Husbands\", which didn't run until February 1735. 20th-century theatre scholar Charles Woods believed that Fielding joined with the management of the Theatre Royal because they were \"people whose legitimate investments were being jeopardized\". Fielding later attacked Theophilus in a revised version of his \"The Author's Farce\" which ran on 15 January 1734. This caused a backlash upon him after the rebelling actors finally won in the dispute, and it was harder for him to stage plays.\n\nTheophilus, through his father, applied to the Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking to have a new license issued, but he was refused. Following this, he applied to Charles Lee, the Master of the Revels, and received a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority. This brought about criticism against Lee in the \"Daily Post\" dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called it just a ploy by the actors. On 30 October, the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their unlicensed theatre. After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law, the management and John Rich, manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, demanded the courts to shut down the unlicensed theatres. A 5 November hearing set a date for a trial, but the case fell apart before it was ever heard over the technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers.\n\nA trial, in which the rebellious actors sued the management at the King's Bench over the management's occupation of the building that the actors controlled the lease, was held on 12 November. The judgment under Chief Justice Philip Yorke was in favour of the actors, and they were to be granted control of the theatre building in March 1734. Highmore, in response, asked for a charge against John Harper, one of the rebellious actors, for being a vagrant, and Harper was sent to Bridewell Palace prison. This provoked a negative reaction by the public, and the action was attacked in the \"Daily Post\" of 16 November. Eventually, a writ of \"habeas corpus\" was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him. Having no other recourse, Highmore began to negotiate the sale of the theatre license. Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks's portions of the license on 24 January 1734. On 2 February, the \"Daily Courant\" announced that Fleetwood asked for the rebellious actors to return. An agreement was reached for higher wages and promotion of Theophilus to a deputy manager of the theatre. The actors took control of the Theatre Royal on 8 March 1734, marking the end of the rebellion.\n\n"}

He was at first surnamed \"Boisgirais\" after his father's estate, but afterwards assumed the name of \"Volney\" (which he had created as a contraction of \"Voltaire\" and \"Ferney\").\n\nHe was born at Craon, Anjou (today in Mayenne) of a noble family. Initially interested in Law and Medicine, he went on to study Classical languages, and his \"Mémoire sur la Chronologie d'Hérodote\" (on Herodotus) rose to the attention of the Académie des Inscriptions and of the group around Claude Adrien Helvétius. Soon after, Volney befriended Pierre Jean George Cabanis, the Marquis de Condorcet, the Baron d'Holbach, and Benjamin Franklin.\n\nHe embarked on a journey to the East in late 1782 and reached Ottoman Egypt, where he spent nearly seven months. Thereafter, he lived for nearly two years in Greater Syria in what is today Lebanon and Israel/Palestine in order to learn Arabic. In 1785 he returned to France, where he spent the following two years compiling his notes and writing his \"Voyage en Egypte et en Syrie\", which was published in 1787, and \"Considérations sur la guerre des Turcs et de la Russie\" in 1788.\n\nHe was a member both of the Estates-General and of the National Constituent Assembly after the outbreak of the French Revolution. In 1791 appeared \"Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires\", an essay on the philosophy of history, containing a vision which predicts the final union of all religions by the recognition of the common truth underlying them all.\n\nVolney tried to put his politico-economic theories into practice in Corsica, where in 1792 he bought an estate and made an attempt to cultivate colonial produce. Chassebœuf de Volney was thrown into prison during the Jacobin Club triumph, but escaped the guillotine; he was some time professor of history at the newly founded \"École Normale\".\n\nVolney was a deist.\n\nIn 1795 he undertook a journey to the United States, where he was accused (1797) by John Adams' administration of being a French spy sent to prepare for the reoccupation of Louisiana by France and then to the West Indies. Consequently, he returned to France. The results of his travels took form in his \"Tableau du climat et du sol des États-Unis\" (1803).\n\nHe was not a partisan of Napoleon Bonaparte, but, being a moderate Liberal, was impressed into service by the First French Empire, and Napoleon made him a count and put him into the senate. After the Bourbon Restoration he was made a Peer of France, upon recognition of his hostility towards the Empire. Chassebœuf became a member of the Académie française in 1795. In his later years he helped to found oriental studies in France, learning Sanskrit from the British linguist Alexander Hamilton, whom he had helped to protect during the Napoleonic era.\n\nHe died in Paris and was buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n\nSometime during his stay in the United States, he and Thomas Jefferson entered into a secret arrangement whereby Jefferson agreed to translate Volney’s \"Ruins of Empires\" into English. Volney visited Monticello for two weeks during June 1796. The two men also met on several occasions at the American Philosophical Society (APS). Jefferson was President of APS at the time and sponsored Volney’s induction into the organization. These meetings provided the two men with ample opportunity to conceive and discuss the translation project.\n\nJefferson, then serving as Vice President under John Adams, appreciated the book’s central theme – that empires rise if government allows enlightened self-interest to flourish. This theme, Jefferson believed, represented an excellent summary of the Enlightenment-based principles upon which the U.S. was founded. However, Jefferson insisted that his translation be published only for certain readers, due to the book’s controversial religious content. Jefferson was preparing to make a bid for the Presidency of the United States in 1800; he was worried his Federalist opponents would attack him as an atheist, if it were known he translated Volney’s supposedly heretical book.\n\nAccording to the evidence discovered by the French researcher Gilbert Chinard (1881-1972), Jefferson translated the invocation plus the first 20 chapters of the 1802 Paris edition of Volney’s \"Ruins\". These first 20 chapters represent a review of human history from the point of view of a post-Enlightenment philosopher. Presumably, Jefferson then became too occupied with the 1800 Presidential campaign and didn't have time to finish the last four chapters of the book. In these chapters Volney describes \"General Assembly of Nations,\" a fictionalized world convention wherein each religion defends its version of \"the truth\" according to its particular holy book. Since no religion is able to scientifically \"prove\" its most basic assertions, Volney concludes the book with a call for an absolute separation of church and state:\n\nFrom this we conclude, that, to live in harmony and peace…we must trace a line of distinction between those (assertions) that are capable of verification, and those that are not; (we must) separate by an inviolable barrier the world of fantastical beings from the world of realities…\n\nSince Jefferson did not have time to complete the translation project, the last four chapters were translated by Joel Barlow, an American land speculator and poet living in Paris. Barlow's name then became associated with the entire translation, further obscuring Jefferson's role in the project.\n\nVolney and Charles-François Dupuis were the first modern writers to advocate the Christ myth theory, the view that Jesus had no historical existence. Volney and Dupuis argued that Christianity was an amalgamation of various ancient mythologies and that Jesus was a mythical character. However, in his version of the Christ Myth theory Volney allowed for an obscure historical figure whose life was integrated into a solar mythology.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5465090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5465090", "title": "Evangelos Averoff", "text": "Evangelos Averoff\n\nEvangelos Averoff-Tositsas (Greek: Ευάγγελος Αβέρωφ Τοσίτσας) (Trikala, April 17, 1910 – Athens, January 2, 1990) son of Anastasios, was a distinguished right-wing Greek politician and author of several books on political and historical topics.\n\nEvangelos Averof got involved in public matters from very early on in his life and played a major role in Greek politics for almost 50 years. In 1940 he was appointed Prefect (regional governor) of Kerkyra (Corfu). During the tripartite Axis occupation of Greece, Averoff was taken hostage and imprisoned in Italy. He escaped a year later and created the \"Freedom or Death\" resistance group, which aimed to liberate Greek and Allied war hostages. In 1946, he was elected to the Greek Parliament as a representative of Ioannina and then went on to serve as deputy minister and minister of Supply, Economy and Agriculture. From 1956 to 1963 he served as Foreign Minister.\n\nDuring the Greek military junta of 1967-1974, Averoff participated in one of the foremost acts of resistance against the government, the Velos mutiny, for which he was arrested as an \"instigator\". \nAfter the restoration of democracy in 1974 during metapolitefsi, Averoff participated in the New Democracy centre-right party under Konstantinos Karamanlis and served as Minister of National Defense in subsequent governments. In 1981 he was elected President of the New Democracy party, which was then the Major Opposition in Parliament,but had to leave his post due to health problems in 1984. In 1984 he was declared the party’s Honorary President. Parallel to his political career he became a prominent author of novels, short stories, theatrical plays, essays and historical analyses.\n\nEvangelos Averoff has been a prominent author of political and historical works, such as \"Customs Union in the Balkans\" (1933), which the Carnegie Institute awarded, \"Fire and Axe, 1944-1949\" (1974) dealing with the Greek Civil War, and \"A History of missed opportunities: The Cypriot Problem 1956-1963\" (1981). He died on 2 January 1990 at the age of 79.\n\nFor the people of Metsovo, Evangelos Averof is the last representative of a long tradition of local benefactors. He played a leading role in the founding of the Foundation of Baron Michael Tositsas, which he ran for 40 years, thus contributing greatly to the contemporary development of the town of Metsovo. Fulfilling the wish of Baron Michael Tositsas that the President of the Foundation bear his family name, he then added the surname Tositsas to his surname.\n\nHe also founded the Evangelos Averof-Tositsas Foundation, to which he donated his significant personal collection of paintings by Greek artists of the 19th and early 20th century and build a gallery to house it. At the same time he invested in local vineyards cultivating the abandoned lands of Metsovo and creating a contemporary winery. After his death (1990) the people of Metsovo honored him by placing his statue in the town’s central square.\n\nIn her best-selling book, \"A Man\", Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci accused Averoff of threatening to kill Greek MP Alexandros Panagoulis a few days before Panagulis' death in a car accident in Athens. According to Oriana Fallaci, Averoff represented the link between the Greek Junta and the political system during the transition period following Metapolitefsi. In particular, Fallaci claims that Panagoulis was in possession of secret documents showing Averoff's direct involvement in brokering the transition from the Joannides Junta to a national unity government led by Konstantinos Karamanlis, keeping himself in charge of managing the relations between the democratic system and the Armed Forces. Averoff's instrumental role in bringing about the appointment of Konstantinos Karamanlis has been confirmed by multiple sources, and Averoff became the Minister of Defense in the 1974 transition government. According to Fallaci, other secret documents showed that Averoff had not taken part in the Greek Resistance during World War II, but instead had been a collaborator of the Italian occupation troops as well as one of the conspirators behind the Velos Mutiny in 1973, after which he apparently collaborated with the Junta and, as a result of his cooperation, was acquitted without charges.\n\n"}

For his support for his successful court theatre he was also known as the \"Theaterherzog\" (theatre duke).\n\nGeorg was the only son of Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and his wife Princess Marie Frederica of Hesse-Kassel. His birth on 2 April 1826 was met with great relief by his father's subjects, as the succession to the duchy was in jeopardy due to a lack of male heirs in the family. Georg would remain an only child for seventeen years, until the birth of his sister Princess Augusta in 1843.\n\nGeorg spent his first few years under the supervision of his parents and grandmother the Dowager Duchess Luise Eleonore. It was the latter who instilled upon Georg the patriotic virtues of his heritage, as well as the sense of duty needed to rule a duchy.\n\nIn 1862, his only sister married Prince Moritz of Saxe-Altenburg, a younger son of Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. They would be the parents of Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, the last reigning Duke of Saxe-Altenburg.\n\nGeorg succeeded his father as Duke of Saxe-Meiningen on 20 September 1866, when Bernhard was forced to abdicate in favor of his son following the defeat of Austria in the Austro-Prussian War. Unlike his father, Georg had remained loyal to the Prussians during the war and was rewarded with a position of Lieutenant General of the Prussian army. Also unlike his parents, the young duke was familiar enough with Prussian politics to regard their attitudes as impractical. During the Franco-Prussian War, Georg led two regiments of soldiers from Meiningen and had the honor of capturing the first French flags at the Battle of Froeschweiler. Notably, he fought in nearly every battle during the war. Georg was a member of Wilhelm I's staff when he entered Paris and would remain a close friend of the Emperor until his death in 1888.\n\nGeorg was married firstly in Charlottenburg on 18 May 1850 to the Princess Charlotte of Prussia. She was the eldest daughter of Prince Albert of Prussia and Princess Marianne of the Netherlands, and was a granddaughter of both Frederick William III of Prussia and William I of the Netherlands.\n\nThey had four children:\n\nThe couple had a short engagement, it was a love match. Among the wedding gifts was an opulent old villa on Lake Como from her mother Marianne. It was renamed the \"Villa Carlotta\" in the bride's honor. They spent the next five years in Berlin and Potsdam but returned to Meiningen for the birth of their children.\n\nOn 27 January 1855, their second son Georg died. Charlotte would follow him two month later, dying in childbirth and leaving Georg inconsolable. He succeeded his father as Duke of Saxe-Meiningen in 1866, eleven years after Charlotte's death.\n\nDespite his recent widowhood, Georg went on a search for a new wife, if only to provide a mother for his two young children. Georg met his second cousin Princess Feodora of Hohenlohe-Langenburg while he was on his way to Italy; they became engaged almost at once. She was a niece of Queen Victoria, being a daughter of Victoria's half-sister Princess Feodora of Leiningen and her husband Ernst I, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. On 23 October 1858, they married at Langenburg.\n\nGeorg and Feodora had three sons:\n\n\nTheir marriage was unhappy however. Georg had never become reconciled to Charlotte's death and Feodora was not temperamentally suited for the life she was expected to lead. She had no intellectual or artistic attainments; even worse, she had no interest in developing any. Despite this fact, Georg attempted to educate her, as he was a great lover of the arts, especially theater. Her mother approved, stating it was \"very sensible of him indeed to arrange for his bride to be much occupied with lessons, to take drawing lessons, and to hear lectures on history\". Georg soon realized however that she would never be as witty and clever as Charlotte. After the death of their third son, Feodora stayed away from Meiningen for as much as decently possible. In 1866, he succeeded as Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, making her \"Duchess consort of Saxe-Meiningen\".\n\nFeodora contracted scarlet fever in January 1872, and died the following month. Despite the many differences between them, Georg had remained fond of her; when she became sick, he was genuinely distraught and sent telegrams to her parents twice daily.\n\nHe was married thirdly and unequally in Liebenstein on 18 March 1873 to Ellen Franz, a former actress. She was given her own style, being known as Helene, \"Baroness von Holdburg\" shortly before their wedding and after their marriage.\n\nThis marriage was morganatic, and greatly angered Kaiser Wilhelm. Georg in turn became increasingly angry and defensive at anyone who failed to recognize his wife and treat her as an equal. Most Germans supported Georg's decision to marry, but Wilhelm felt particularly upset because Georg's first wife had been a kinswoman of his. Wilhelm was not the only one who objected to the marriage; Georg's father ex-Duke Bernhard was equally angry and threatened to appeal directly to the people with the mistaken view that they would support his opinion. Officials and ministers of the Saxe-Meiningen court also objected to the match. Many resigned their offices and their wives openly insulted Ellen. The army also refused to salute her, further angering Duke Georg. He sent an emissary to Berlin with a complaint to Wilhelm, who responded by ordering that all officers must in the future salute Ellen as Baroness von Heldburg. She was never styled as \"Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen\" like his second wife.\n\nThe couple had no children. Well loved by the people, she and Duke Georg created and developed the progressive Meiningen Theater.\n\nAfter the Franco-Prussian War, Georg devoted himself to theatre. He was one of the greatest intellectuals among the higher nobility during the German Empire. He is particularly known for developing the Meiningen Ensemble using his court theatre. Using his knowledge of art history and his drawing skills, he designed highly detailed, historically accurate scenery, costumes, and properties. In addition, he choreographed large crowd scenes that stunned audiences across Europe. He and his ensemble toured Europe extensively, and had a profound effect on theatre production across the continent. There is no doubt that Realism saw the development of the director as a separate entity, someone with an eye to oversee, someone responsible for the overall conception, interpretation, style and detail of the theatrical performance. The Meiningen Ensemble from its roots in the late 1830s under the directorships of Georg II and Ludwig Chronegk, proceeded to develop a theatre company bereft of theatre-managers and the star system. A system centered on realistic acting and staging and well-developed 'unified' productions. The Ensemble which began as a court theatre but started touring in 1874, used detailed research of people, locations, costumes and set, along with highly choreographed and individually detailed crowd scenes, to create productions which were esthetically unified and realistic in their presentations. \nIn an article for the \"Deutsche Bühne\", the Duke outlined his principles for directing a play, the most important were the creation of a Stage Picture (the pictorial effect created by the synthesis of the actors with the set and props), historical exactitude in the mise en scene, an acting style which used Precise Gestural and Vocal Imitation, the use of Period or Authentic Clothing and Costumes and the use of Group Orchestration by precise planning and direction of all group and crowd scenes\n\nThe initial aim of the Meiningen Ensemble was to create, within the context of an ensemble, historical exactitude of the mise en scene. The Meiningen company sought to create the illusion of natural space within the confines of the proscenium arch. Duke Georg was concerned mainly with creating a naturalistic illusory atmosphere where the actor could establish or re-create authenticity in performance. Chronegk and the Duke prepared sketches and diagrams showing actors how to walk and move in period clothing to achieve a naturalistic feel to stage characterization. The Meiningen productions influenced playwrights like Henrik Ibsen, actors like Henry Irving and directors like Antoine and Stanislavsky.\n\nThe conventions of realism for the Meiningen seemed to create the means by which a theatre artist creates the illusion of everyday life. They saw that art should copy science by depicting life 'as it is' without direct comment, interpretation and the structural edifice of the well made play. The Duke believed that a lifelike reality was achieved on stage through a careful study of the play and showing this in stage movement, composition and stage business. His major contribution to the stage was not just his use of realistic settings and costumes but in the way he tried to use and integrate performers as part of the mise en scene. The use of costume did not merely reflect historical accuracy but attempted to help actors perform in a style and mode which integrated with other elements. He demanded that all the actors were at most rehearsals and he carefully worked out the actions of even everyone in crowd scenes. Individual members of crowds and main actors alike were expected to provide specific research and character analysis related to the events depicted on stage. He was known for his great vision and memory and he often worked without a prompt book or script, working from his head and using a runner to ferry his ideas to his assistant Chronegk. Because his work toured extensively from 1874-1890, Meiningen's unified productions had a great impact on the theatre world. He is widely considered the theatre's first Modern director.\n\nThe Duke was also the patron of one of Europe's leading orchestras, the Meiningen Court Orchestra. The orchestra attained its distinction after the Duke hired the conductor Hans von Bülow in 1880. Bülow instituted stringent rehearsal methods and, with the Duke's agreement, hired eight musicians, raising its membership to 44. He offered the orchestra as a trial ensemble to Johannes Brahms, who was to try out his Second Piano Concerto and Third Symphony with the orchestra and premiered his Fourth Symphony there, conducting it himself. A dispute with Brahms over who was to conduct the premiere of his Fourth Symphony in Frankfurt led Bülow to resign (he was scheduled to premiere it there, but Brahms pre-empted him by conducting it with a local orchestra). Bülow was succeeded briefly by his 20-year-old assistant Richard Strauss, who resigned after a month, and then by Fritz Steinbach. Steinbach championed the music of Brahms, instituting Brahms Festivals in 1895 and 1897 in Meiningen with the composer present. A private concert by the Meiningen Court Orchestra and Steinbach for Brahms in 1891 led the composer to notice the artistry of the ensemble's first clarinetist, Richard Mühlfeld; Brahms promised to compose music for Mühlfeld, and did indeed compose his Clarinet Trio, Clarinet Quintet, and two Clarinet Sonatas. In 1897 the Duke undertook the construction of a Brahms monument in Meiningen's English gardens, sculpted by Adolf von Hildebrand.\n\nIn his later life, Georg suffered from acute deafness and retired from active life. He had been fond of hunting and traveling, and was a collector of antiques and manuscripts. He died on 25 June 1914 at Bad Wildungen and was succeeded by his eldest son Bernhard.\n\nGeorg is buried at \"\", next to his third wife.\n\n\n\n"}

He has written biographies on Oscar Torp and Haakon Lie, and a history book about all the Presidents of the United States.\n\nOn May 22–23, 2013, he was interviewed by VG for 30 hours, 1 minute and 44 seconds, setting a Guinness World Record for the longest interview ever, beating the previous record by over four hours.\n\nBorn in Mo i Rana, Lahlum grew up in Rødøy, a small community that he did not find enjoyable; he called his own childhood \"gloomy\". Lahlum finished his cand.philol. degree (master's degree) in history from the University of Oslo in 2002, including subjects in political science and history of religion. Since completing his studies, he has at times been a lecturer and advisor at the Lillehammer University College.\n\nHis first biography was a 560-page book on former prime minister Oscar Torp, which was published in 2007. The history book on the US presidents was published in 2008. The biography included regular biographical coverage of each president's policy, but also more \"tabloid\" coverage about matters such as relationship trouble and drinking habits. The conservative website \"Minerva\" credited the book as a good, well-written reference work, finding most of the book to be well balanced. It was more critical of the coverage on George W. Bush, which it found unbalanced.\n\nLahlum was in contact with the former Labour Party secretary Haakon Lie in the last years of his life, and worked with Hilde Harbo on publishing Lie's book \"Slik jeg ser det nå\" in 2008. In 2009 Lahlum published a full 848-page biography on the then late Lie, entitled \"Haakon Lie. Historien, mytene og mennesket\" (\"Haakon Lie, the history, the myths and the person\"). The book debunked several of the negative rumors surrounding Haakon Lie, including allegations that Lie was a CIA agent. The biography also found that Lie was highly critical of Thorbjørn Jagland, Yngve Hågensen, Trond Giske and Helga Pedersen. \n\nIn 2013 Lahlum's biography of Håvard Vederhus (1989-2011) was published. Vederhus was a former leader of the School Student Union of Norway and a Workers' Youth League member who was killed at Utøya during the 2011 Norway Attacks. The book was titled \"Et kvart liv\" (literally translated: \"A quarter of a life\").\n\nLahlum published his first crime novel, \"The Human Flies\" (In Norwegian: \"Menneskefluene\"), in 2010. The next novels in the series were \"Satellite People\" (\"Satelittmenneskene\") in 2011 and \"The Catalyst Killing\" (\"Katalysatormordet\") in 2012. The novels are written in classical style, take place in the late 1960s, and feature inspector Kolbjørn Kristiansen as the protagonist, assisted by the young and disabled Patricia Louise Borchmann.\n\nPolitically, Lahlum represents the Socialist Left Party (SV) and became the leader of the county chapter in Oppland in February 2010. He has also served as leader of SV's local chapter in Gjøvik. In the Norwegian parliamentary election, 2017 he was their top ballot candidate in Oppland.\n\nLahlum is an active chess player with a FIDE rating of 2204 as of November 2009, having been an International Arbiter since 2000. Lahlum played in the top section of the Norwegian Chess Championship in 2001, and was in the sole lead after four rounds, but a string of losses left him at +3=2-4 and 10th place in the end.\n\nLahlum plays for the chess club in Porsgrunn, and has been captain for his club in team chess events. He is otherwise well known for organizing and arbitrating several tournaments. He was editor of the Norwegian Chess Federation's publication \"Norsk sjakkblad\" in 2006. Lahlum's style in organizing tournaments is also original, with round reports featuring a description of every game played, player portraits, and grading each player's performance.\n\nIn early May 2013, it was announced that Lahlum would cooperate with Norwegian newspaper \"Verdens Gang\" in an attempt to set a world record for the longest interview ever made, setting their goal at 30 hours. Interviewing would be experienced journalist and interviewer Mads Andersen.\n\nOn May 22 at 11:00, local time, the interview began in the lobby of the newspapers main office in Oslo, with the public allowed to visit and watch the event during the opening hours. It was also shown live on the newspapers own internet television channel, \"VGTV\", where it had more than 370 000 viewers during the broadcast. The following day, at 13:00:05, local time, they beat the previous record, which was 26 hours and 4 seconds, but was set to reach their goal of 30 hours.\n\nOn May 23, at 16:01:44 local time, the interview was ended by Andersen, simply saying: \"Hans Olav Lahlum, thank you very much for the chat.\", having just finished their last topic, US presidential elections from 1912 to 2012. While the new record was first stated to be 30:01:15, it was later made official as 30 hours, 1 minute and 44 seconds, as the digital clock on-screen next to the stage had been started 30 seconds too late after one of the breaks. \n\nDuring the 30-hour interview the two participants had five minutes of break time allocated for every hour, which they were allowed to save up for longer breaks. They were also served food and beverages at regular intervals, which had been pre-selected by the participants themselves, and were allowed to freely stretch their legs during the interview, as long as they didn't stop talking. The longest pause during the interview, excluding the breaks, was only four seconds.\n\nDuring the thirty-hour interview, Lahlum covered a vast number of pre-selected topics, including a near five-hour runthrough of all US presidents, and a two-hour runthrough of all US presidential elections since 1912. The interview has since been made available for free viewing in its entirety online. Full interview.\n\nLahlum is known for his unconventional style, which once included letting his beard grow only on the left side of his face.

{"id": "181324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181324", "title": "Heidelberg Appeal", "text": "Heidelberg Appeal\n\nThe Heidelberg Appeal, authored by Michel Salomon, was an appeal directed against the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. organised initially by the tobacco industry as part of its \"junk-science\" program. The Heidelberg Appeal's goal was similar to the later published Leipzig Declaration and an earlier. Before the publication, Fred Singer, who has initiated several petitions like the Heidelberg Appeal, and Michel Salomon, had organized a conference in Heidelberg, which led to that document. It was published at the last day of the Rio Summit 1992 and warned governments that they don't base their policy on environmental policy, which they regarded as \"pseudoscientific arguments or false and nonrelevant data.\" It was brought forward by the tobacco and asbestos industry, to support the climate-denying Global Climate Coalition. According to SourceWatch the appeal is \"a scam perpetrated by the asbestos and tobacco industries in support of the Global Climate Coalition\". Both industries had no direct reason to deny global warming, but rather wanted to promote their \"sound science\" agenda, which basically states that industry-funded science is good science and science contradicting those science (such as environmental science) is bad science or \"junk science\".\n\nThe technique used by Salomon's group to enlist members of the scientific establishment to lend their names to climate denial by signing the Appeal document, was quite unique. It is important to realise that, at this time, some sections of the environmental movement were anti-science, and anti-technology. They blamed the scientists as much as the industrialists for damaging the ecology of the planet.\n\nThe document most of the signatories thought they were signing was an appeal for the society to pay more attention to scientists than to the many irrational health and environmental activists. They were objecting to the way in which they were losing their privileged position as the 'go-to authorities' on all such health and environmental matters. They didn't see this as a climate-denial statement.\n\nOne of the signatories, Nobel Prize winner Philip Anderson, a professor of physics at Princeton University, cited the continued dispersal of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as a prime example of an environmentally hazardous situation identified by scientists. He complained that despite science's disapproval, CFC's persists to be released as a result of industrial interests and denial of potential harm. He asserted that:\n\"It's a sneaky thing to keep the CFC plants going. [... However ... ] industrialists, not scientists are to blame for much of the planet's ecological degradation.\"\nHe agreed with Salomon in attacking the animal-rights people as \"\"clearly irrational?\" [... ] \"This is obvious when they resort to illegality and violence to propagate their ends.\" [such] forces \"make the public afraid of science.\"\" \nNo draft of the original signed document exists, but participants have since claimed that the document they signed was a general 'motherhood' statement about the need for better science in dealing with hazardous and health-related products. However, when release and publicised by Fred Singer's Science & Environmental Policy Project operation specific mention of climate change was added in the introductory passages and press release. It was carefully released to coincide with the opening of the Rio Earth Summit.\n\nThe \"Heidelberg Appeal\" has been enthusiastically embraced by large corporations and individual critics of the environmental movement. Conservative think tanks frequently cite the Heidelberg Appeal as proof that scientists reject the theory of global warming as well as a host of other environmental health risks associated with modern science and industry. Its name has subsequently been adopted by the Heidelberg Appeal Nederland Foundation, which was founded in 1993 and disputes health risks related to nitrates in foods and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Heidelberg Appeal was promoted in 1993 by the International Center for a Scientific Ecology, a group set up by Michael Salomon \"that was considered important in Philip Morris' plans to create a group in Europe similar to The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC)\".\n\nMichel Salomon was the editor of the Paris-based \"Projections\" magazine. He was hired by Philip Morris to extend their junk-science program into Europe. They had already been highly successful with:<br>\nFollowing the Heidelberg Appeal, Salomon established for them the ICSE (aka \"CIES\") which is variously quoted in the tobacco archive documents as the International Center for a Scientific Ecology or, in French, the Centre International pour une Ecologie Scientifique. He wrote about the appeal:\n\nWhy Heidelberg? We wanted to meet in a prestigious European university town. Oxford or Cambridge would have done just as well. The warm welcome we received at the beginning of our round of the university towns, from cardiologist Gothard Schettler, Vice President of the Academy of Science at Heidelberg, and from Professor Harald zur Hausen at the Cancer Research Institute, persuaded us to pitch our tent on the banks of the Neckar. As the substances in question were incriminated, among other things, for their supposed or real carcinogenic effects, we accepted Professor zur Hausen's generous hospitality. \n\nThe Board of the Center:\nThe UK tobacco industry's on-going contact to the ICSE (which involved the ability to check and launder their public statements) was conducted through one of the tobacco industry's long-term statistical consultants, Peter N Lee. and \n"}

He was educated at a Catholic gymnasium (high school) in Budapest and began his university studies in 1945 at the University of Budapest. His studies were disrupted by the war and postwar chaos, and he left Hungary in 1948, following the communist takeover. He then studied history at the Sorbonne in Paris and worked as a journalist in France and for Radio Free Europe in West Germany. In 1956, unable to gain residence in France, he settled in New York City where he studied modern European history at Columbia University under Fritz Stern. He obtained his doctorate in 1964 and spent the next 33 years teaching at Columbia. He was the Director of Columbia's Institute on East Central Europe between 1968 and 1979.\n\nDeák has written extensively on eastern and central European history and politics. His publications include \"Weimar Germany's Left-wing Intellectuals\" (1968); \"The Lawful Revolution: Louis Kossuth and the Hungarians, 1848-1849\" (1979); \"Beyond Nationalism: A Social and Political History of the Habsburg Officer Corps, 1848-1918\" (1990); and \"Essays on Hitler's Europe\" (2001). He edited and partly wrote, together with Jan T. Gross and Tony Judt, \"The Politics of Retribution in Europe: World War II and Its Aftermath\" (2000). His most recent work is \"Europe on Trial. The Story of Collaboration, Resistance, and Retribution during World War II\" (2015).\nHe has also written extensively for the \"New York Review of Books\" and other periodicals.\n\nIn 1964 Deák was able to visit Hungary for the first time since his departure, and thereafter he regularly attended academic conferences in Hungary and worked to re-establish links between American and Hungarian historians. In 1990, following the fall of the communist regime, he was elected to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He retired from teaching in 1997 and was later a visiting professor at Stanford University. He has continued to publish on European history, particularly issues relating to the Holocaust. His wife, Gloria Deak, is an art historian.\n\n"}

He served as Town Clerk of Glasgow for thirty-one years, during which time the entire city was transformed. Its powers and amenities were improved by by-laws and Acts of Parliament, and Marwick directed the city of Glasgow's development for much of the second half of the 19th century.\n\nA son of William Marwick, a merchant from Kirkwall, Orkney, and his wife, Margaret Garioch, James was born at 95 Kirkgate in central Leith, where his father then worked as a baker.\n\nJames was educated in Kirkwall Grammar School and then studied Law at the University of Edinburgh. He was then apprenticed to James B Watt solicitor at 9 York Place in Edinburgh. He was admitted a procurator at Dundee in 1852, and became a solicitor before the Supreme Courts six years later. In 1855 he founded the Edinburgh legal firm of Watt & Marwick. As the address of this firm is also 9 York Place it is presumed he merged with the same James Watt under whom he was apprenticed. \n\nFor some time he was a member of the Town Council of Edinburgh, and he became Town Clerk of that city in 1860. He was also clerk to the Convention of Royal Burghs from 1861 to 1876. In 1873 Marwick was offered a salary of £2,500 per annum (three times his previous salary) to succeed Angus Turner as Glasgow's Town Clerk. He used his influence to promote the expansion of the city's boundaries. The City Chambers was erected between 1882 and 1888 as a symbol of municipal confidence and wealth. During those years he occupied a unique place in the municipal, literary, and social life of the city. He enjoyed the friendship of the successive Lord Provosts of Edinburgh and Glasgow. He gradually built up a reputation as the leading authority on municipal law in Scotland. His knowledge was utilised by successive Lord Advocates, and his opinion constantly sought by the Town Clerks of other burghs; and in no instance was that opinion overturned by the Courts. As a municipal organiser he had the task of framing and carrying out many of the greatest city enterprises of his time, including extension and improvements of the city, duplication of the water-works, the purification of the River Clyde, the Municipal Tramways, and municipal electricity.\n\nMarwick was also a prolific historian and writer. It was upon his initiative that the Scottish Burgh Record Society was founded, and he edited a number of the society's publications. He never lost interest in the island county from which he sprang, and many a young Orcadian, on coming south, was indebted to him for advice and help. Fellow Orcadian and town councillor William Walls was a particular friend. When in Edinburgh he took an active interest in the affairs of the Augustine Church, of which the Rev. William Lindsay Alexander was minister. In Glasgow he also took an active part in the management of Trinity Congregational Church.\n\nIn 1861 he served as the first President of the Edinburgh Photographic Society.\n\nMarwick was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1864 his proposer being Charles Piazzi Smyth. He received the degree of LL.D. from Glasgow University in 1878. The Freedom of the Burgh of Kirkwall was conferred on him later, and in 1888, on the occasion of her visit to the first Glasgow Exhibition, Queen Victoria gave him the honour of knighthood, this being the first occasion in which a municipal officer in Scotland was thus distinguished. When he left Edinburgh in 1873 the Corporation and citizens presented his wife with a full-length portrait of him painted by George Herdman, R.S.A., and on his retiral from the Town Clerkship of Glasgow in 1904 he was presented with an address and a valuable gift in testimony of the esteem in which he was held by the officials of the Corporation. Subsequently the citizens had his bust executed in duplicate by George Frampton, one of these being lodged in the art galleries, and the other presented to Sir James's family.\n\nHe lived his final years at 19 Woodside Terrace in Glasgow,\n\nHe died on 24 March 1908 and is buried in Warriston Cemetery in Edinburgh. The unusual monument lies to the north of the vaults.\n\nHis wife, Lady Jane Marwick (1832-1919), whom he married in 1855, was a daughter of James Black Watt, a solicitor in Edinburgh, with whom he had a son James Marwick, an accountant who founded one of the predecessor firms of KPMG.\n\nHis daughter Jean Watt Warwick married the architect John James Burnet.\n\nHe appears to be uncle to the Edinburgh architect Thomas P. Marwick.\n\nAs writer:\n\nAs editor:\n\n"}

His previous Mabou Mines production include \"Red Beads\" created in collaboration with puppeteer Basil Twist and composer Ushio Torikai. Of the September 2005 New York City premiere, the \"New York Times\" critic wrote \"...theater as sorcery; it is a crossroads where artistic traditions meet to invent a marvelous common language. It is a fairy tale, a puppet play and a chamber opera… amazing work.\"\n\nMabou Mines Dollhouse\", a deconstruction of the Ibsen classic, won 2004 Obie Awards for Best Director and Best Performance. The production toured nationally and internationally to more than 30 cities on 5 continents. Breuer directed high definition video adaptation of stage production for Arte television France, which was aired throughout Europe.\n\nMuch of Breuer's previous work with Mabou Mines premiered at The Public Theater (NYC) under the patronage of the late Joseph Papp, and at the La Mama Experimental Theater Club under the patronage of Ellen Stewart. These include his Obie-winning adaptation of three works by Samuel Beckett: \"Play\", \"Come and Go\" and \"The Lost Ones\".\n\nHe authored/directed Mabou Mines' trilogy,\n\"Animations\", including \"The B Beaver\", \"The Red Horse\" and \"The Shaggy Dog Animation\", which was awarded the Obie for Best Play in 1978. In 1980 Breuer received two Obies for writing and direction of his play, A Prelude to a Death in Venice\". He also wrote and directed \"An Epidog\", the winner of the President's Commission Kennedy Center-American Express Award for Best New Work.\n\nBreuer's best-known work is \"The Gospel at Colonus\", a Pentecostal Gospel rendering of Sophocles' \"Oedipus at Colonus\", created with composer Bob Telson and starring Morgan Freeman and Clarence Fountain.

{"id": "40794862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40794862", "title": "Luiz Heitor Corrêa de Azevedo", "text": "Luiz Heitor Corrêa de Azevedo\n\nLuiz Heitor Corrêa de Azevedo (13 December 1905 – 10 November 1992) was a Brazilian journalist, musicologist and folklorist.\n\nLuiz Heitor Corrêa de Azevedo studied at the National Institute of Music on Rio de Janeiro and his piano professors were Alfredo Bevilacqua between the years of 1924 and 1925, and Charley Lachmund between 1926 and 1927. At the same school he has studied harmony, counterpoint and fugue with Professor Paulo Silva. Initially Luiz Heitor focused his studies to be a composer, however by the late 1920s he has inclined to the musicology field and music criticism.\n\nIn 1928 he has started as a columnist of the newspaper “O Imparcial” (The Impartial). In 1932 Luiz Heitor became the librarian of “Instituto Nacional de Música” (National Institute of Music) on Rio de Janeiro. In the year of 1934, he founded and directed the “Revista Brasileira de Música” (Brazilian Magazine of Music) which was the editor until 1942. At the same year, Luiz Heitor organized and published the \"Arquivo de Música Brasileira\" (Brazilian Music Archive), an important supplement to the Magazine. The \"Archive\" goals were to publish scores of Brazilian music, which stood out in its first publishing: \"Missa dos Defuntos\" (1809) for 4 voices a cappella and \"Tantum Ergo\" by Padre José Maurício Nunes Garcia, \"Canto Religioso\" and \"O Salutaris\" by Francisco Manuel da Silva, and several opera's passages reduced to piano part from Joanna de Flandres by Carlos Gomes.\nIn 1939, he assumed the chair of National Folklore Professor in the Escola Nacional de Música (Nacional School of Music). Throughout this period he gave incentive and represented an important contribution for Brazilian musicology which was still developing. Furthermore, he held the chair of titular professor at the “Escola Nacional de Música” (National School of Music) where he developed the ethnomusicology curriculum and founded, in 1943, the “Centro de Pesquisas Folclóricas” (Folklore Research Centre). This center produced a remarkable number of publications which were based on Brazilian musicology. Likewise, he was the music history Professor in the Conservatório Brasileiro de Música (Brazilian Conservatory of Music) occupying this place until 1947.\n\nIn addition to his participation at the “Revista Brasileira de Música” and as an editor of a journal, Luiz Heitor directed the classical music radio program Hora do Brasil (Brazilian Hour), of the “Departmento de Imprensa e Propaganda” (Department of Press and Propaganda). Moreover, he managed a section of the music in the “Revista Cultura Política” (Political Culture Magazine).\n\nHe acquired the post of Brazil’s representative in the Division of Music at the Pan American Union In Washington, D.C., and from 1941 to 1942 he served as a consultant for the Music Division from the Organization of American States. By the later 1940s he moved to Paris and became a member of UNESCO Music Programme specialist. In the year of 1949 he assumed a chair in the music curated from UNESCO at the International Music Council. He also led the Section for Cooperation with Non-Governmental Organizations between 1953 and 1965. Likewise he was a professor of the Institut des Hautes Etudes de l’Amérique Latine of the University of Paris from 1954 to 1968.\n\nHis main book was published in 1956 and it is called “150 anos de música no Brasil (1800 – 1950)” (150 years of music in Brazil.)\n\nLuiz Heitor made important contributions to the Brazilian culture, more specifically to the musicology field, by searching and systematizing national music and folklore. His was the first initiative of systematic editing of national authors’ works. He helped create the first Brazilian Journal of Musicology, Revista Brasileira de Música, in the 1934. The Revista Brasileira de Música addressed to research focusing on mapping the Brazilian musical culture and was the first academic musical journal in Brazil. Luiz Heitor also promoted the publication of music books as part of his mission at Escola de Música Brasileira.\n\nHis effort on folklore research became more important while creating the Centro de Pesquisas Folclóricas. Since its creation, Folklore is considered an important field of study. Before Luiz Heitor's accomplishments, Folklore was merely considered a secondary discipline. Heitor directed the research in the following Brazilian regions: Goiás State in 1942 (producing 64 documents and 19); Ceará State in 1943 (where he produced 262 documents and 75 recordings); Minas Gerais State in 1944 (280 documents and 100 recordings) and Rio Grande do Sul State in 1946 (293 documents and 116 recordings.) Heitor determined that it was remarkable that there had never before been an accurate mapping of Brazilian musical culture. All of Luiz Heitor’s efforts to systematize Brazilian folklore made the information accessible to those researching in the field and helped promote the musical accomplishments of the Brazilian people.\n\nLuis Heitor’s work in musicology can also be seen in published books and articles. One of the most important accomplishments was exposuring of Brazilian music in Europe through the actions at UNESCO in Paris. His effort to systematize and map the Brazilian folklore, in order to make it more accessible to the research field, it was important to promote and disseminate the culture of the country.\n\nThe participation of Luiz Heitor at UNESCO was gradual. First, he participated in a committee of specialists which outlined the humanities program of UNESCO. Luiz Heitor then participated as an intern, before finally receiving an invitation to work full-time in the organization. Later, he assumed a position as the International Music Counselor. The International Music Couselor is a professional organization which promotes the significance of music in the lives of people around the world. International Music Couselor's mission is to elevate the value the music in order to raise awareness of the particularities of the music of all countries. This organization intends to ensure that all music is shared and promoted.\n\nEven with his job with UNESCO, Heitor still worked with the administration of the “Centro de Pesquisas Folclóricas” in Brazil. The close relationship with Brazil allowed the material from “Centro de Pesquisa Folclórica” to be sent to Heitor, who would then add it to UNESCO cataloges. At the beginning of his work, Heitor catalogued all the songs they had in the collection by dividing amongst classical music, oriental music, and folk music. In the year 1949, Heitor published the first catalogue based on Chopin's music, which was important to the process of cataloguing world music.\n\nDuring his time at UNESCO, Luiz Heitor devoted himself to promoting Brazil music by giving opportunities to artists and researchers interested in bringing Brazilian music to Europe. He also made efforts to educate Brazilian people about how Brazilian music related to their daily lives. Heitor sent letters promoting all the concerts, recitals, lectures or other activities where Brazilian culture was involved all over Europe. Even though his constant effort and focus was Brazilian culture, he also participated of several achieval, research, and recording projects for music from other parts of the world. Heitor fulfilled his role as counselor in the organization and aided in strengthening the visibility of world culture by promoting Brazilian music.\n\nThe article \"My Memories of UNESCO\" dated from 1947 to 1965, written by Luiz Heitor, presents facts and experiences of the musicologist in his work UNESCO. This article highlights some information he wrote in letters sent to Brazil.\n\nRegarding the artistic production, he related that very little things had been done at this time by UNESCO in the field of music. The only things they had in the official documents were a survey on the conditions of musical life in several countries, and a vague project regarding international discography to be submitted to the General Conference. The discography would, in the music area, the same than the colorful reproduction artworks which would be the essential part of UNESCO's program in the visual arts sector.\n\nIn the music section, that it was Luiz Heitor's job, it was still quite confused. According to his letters there was a program outlined, but there was a lack of ways to executed it. He noticed that there was international organizations, which were consolidated, destinated to the music and musician's interests. Since they organizations existed, he did not ignore them, and he tried to facilitate their relations with UNESCO. Further, he did not think it was necessary to create a new organization. So, he researched about them in order to know if they wanted to join each other in a kind of federation, under the auspices of UNESCO. This federation finally took the assignment of counsel: The International Music Council, which was destinated to organize, not only the organizations mentioned, but also the nationals organizations of each country which gathered in national Committees of Music. Moreover, they chose some people to represent them because of their titles and because of their undisputed projection in contemporary music life, at that time.\n\n\nLamas, Dulce. \"Publicação comemorativa dos 80 anos de Luiz Heitor Correade Azevedo\".

{"id": "84786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84786", "title": "Meiji period", "text": "Meiji period\n\nThe , or Meiji era, was a Japanese era which extended from October 23, 1868, to July 30, 1912. This period represents the first half of the Empire of Japan, during which Japanese society moved from being an isolated feudal society to a Westernised form. Fundamental changes affected its social structure, internal politics, economy, military and foreign relations. The period corresponded to the reign of Emperor Meiji and was succeeded upon the accession of Emperor Taishō by the Taishō period.\n\nOn February 3, 1867, the 14-year-old Prince Mutsuhito succeeded his father, Emperor Kōmei, to the Chrysanthemum Throne as the 122nd emperor.\n\nOn November 9, 1867, then-\"shōgun\" Tokugawa Yoshinobu tendered his resignation to the Emperor, and formally stepped down ten days later. Imperial restoration occurred the next year on January 3, 1868, with the formation of the new government. The fall of Edo in the summer of 1868 marked the end of the Tokugawa shogunate, and a new era, \"Meiji\", was proclaimed.\n\nThe first reform was the promulgation of the Five Charter Oath in 1868, a general statement of the aims of the Meiji leaders to boost morale and win financial support for the new government. Its five provisions consisted of:\n\n\nImplicit in the Charter Oath was an end to exclusive political rule by the bakufu (a \"shōgun\"s direct administration including officers), and a move toward more democratic participation in government. To implement the Charter Oath, a rather short-lived constitution with eleven articles was drawn up in June 1868. Besides providing for a new Council of State, legislative bodies, and systems of ranks for nobles and officials, it limited office tenure to four years, allowed public balloting, provided for a new taxation system, and ordered new local administrative rules.\n\nThe Meiji government assured the foreign powers that it would follow the old treaties negotiated by the bakufu and announced that it would act in accordance with international law. Mutsuhito, who was to reign until 1912, selected a new reign title—\"Meiji\", or Enlightened Rule—to mark the beginning of a new era in Japanese history. To further dramatize the new order, the capital was relocated from Kyoto, where it had been situated since 794, to Tokyo (Eastern Capital), the new name for Edo. In a move critical for the consolidation of the new regime, most \"daimyōs\" voluntarily surrendered their land and census records to the Emperor in the abolition of the Han system, symbolizing that the land and people were under the Emperor's jurisdiction.\n\nConfirmed in their hereditary positions, the daimyo became governors, and the central government assumed their administrative expenses and paid samurai stipends. The han were replaced with prefectures in 1871, and authority continued to flow to the national government. Officials from the favored former han, such as Satsuma, Chōshū, Tosa, and Hizen staffed the new ministries. Formerly old court nobles, and lower-ranking but more radical samurai, replaced bakufu appointees and daimyo as a new ruling class appeared.\n\nIn as much as the Meiji Restoration had sought to return the Emperor to a preeminent position, efforts were made to establish a Shinto-oriented state much like it was 1,000 years earlier. Since Shinto and Buddhism had molded into a syncretic belief in the prior one-thousand years and Buddhism had been closely connected with the shogunate, this involved the separation of Shinto and Buddhism (shinbutsu bunri) and the associated destruction of various Buddhist temples and related violence (haibutsu kishaku). Furthermore, a new State Shinto had to be constructed for the purpose. In 1871, the Office of Shinto Worship () was established, ranking even above the Council of State in importance. The \"kokutai\" ideas of the Mito school were embraced, and the divine ancestry of the Imperial House was emphasized. The government supported Shinto teachers, a small but important move. Although the Office of Shinto Worship was demoted in 1872, by 1877 the Home Ministry controlled all Shinto shrines and certain Shinto sects were given state recognition. Shinto was released from Buddhist administration and its properties restored. Although Buddhism suffered from state sponsorship of Shinto, it had its own resurgence. Christianity also was legalized, and Confucianism remained an important ethical doctrine. Increasingly, however, Japanese thinkers identified with Western ideology and methods.\n\nA major proponent of representative government was Itagaki Taisuke (1837–1919), a powerful Tosa leader who had resigned from the Council of State over the Korean affair in 1873. Itagaki sought peaceful, rather than rebellious, means to gain a voice in government. He started a school and a movement aimed at establishing a constitutional monarchy and a legislative assembly. Such movements were called The Freedom and People's Rights Movement. Itagaki and others wrote the Tosa Memorial () in 1874, criticizing the unbridled power of the oligarchy and calling for the immediate establishment of representative government.\n\nBetween 1871 and 1873, a series of land and tax laws were enacted as the basis for modern fiscal policy. Private ownership was legalized, deeds were issued, and lands were assessed at fair market value with taxes paid in cash rather than in kind as in pre-Meiji days and at slightly lower rates.\n\nDissatisfied with the pace of reform after having rejoined the Council of State in 1875, Itagaki organized his followers and other democratic proponents into the nationwide Aikokusha (Society of Patriots) to push for representative government in 1878. In 1881, in an action for which he is best known, Itagaki helped found the Jiyūtō (Liberal Party), which favored French political doctrines.\n\nIn 1882, Ōkuma Shigenobu established the Rikken Kaishintō (Constitutional Progressive Party), which called for a British-style constitutional democracy. In response, government bureaucrats, local government officials, and other conservatives established the Rikken Teiseitō (Imperial Rule Party), a pro-government party, in 1882. Numerous political demonstrations followed, some of them violent, resulting in further government restrictions. The restrictions hindered the political parties and led to divisions within and among them. The Jiyūtō, which had opposed the Kaishinto, was disbanded in 1884 and Ōkuma resigned as Kaishintō president.\n\nGovernment leaders, long preoccupied with violent threats to stability and the serious leadership split over the Korean affair, generally agreed that constitutional government should someday be established. The Chōshū leader Kido Takayoshi had favored a constitutional form of government since before 1874, and several proposals for constitutional guarantees had been drafted. While acknowledging the realities of political pressure, however, the oligarchy was determined to keep control. Thus, modest steps were taken.\n\nThe Osaka Conference in 1875 resulted in the reorganization of government with an independent judiciary and an appointed Chamber of Elders (Genrōin) tasked with reviewing proposals for a legislature. The Emperor declared that \"constitutional government shall be established in gradual stages\" as he ordered the Council of Elders to draft a constitution.\n\nThree years later, the Conference of Prefectural Governors established elected prefectural assemblies. Although limited in their authority, these assemblies represented a move in the direction of representative government at the national level, and by 1880 assemblies also had been formed in villages and towns. In 1880 delegates from twenty-four prefectures held a national convention to establish the Kokkai Kisei Dōmei (League for the Establishment of a National Assembly).\n\nAlthough the government was not opposed to parliamentary rule, confronted with the drive for \"people's rights\", it continued to try to control the political situation. New laws in 1875 prohibited press criticism of the government or discussion of national laws. The Public Assembly Law (1880) severely limited public gatherings by disallowing attendance by civil servants and requiring police permission for all meetings.\n\nWithin the ruling circle, however, and despite the conservative approach of the leadership, Okuma continued as a lone advocate of British-style government, a government with political parties and a cabinet organized by the majority party, answerable to the national assembly. He called for elections to be held by 1882 and for a national assembly to be convened by 1883; in doing so, he precipitated a political crisis that ended with an 1881 imperial rescript declaring the establishment of a national assembly in 1890 and dismissing Okuma.\n\nRejecting the British model, Iwakura and other conservatives borrowed heavily from the Prussian constitutional system. One of the Meiji oligarchy, Itō Hirobumi (1841–1909), a Chōshū native long involved in government affairs, was charged with drafting Japan's constitution. He led a constitutional study mission abroad in 1882, spending most of his time in Germany. He rejected the United States Constitution as \"too liberal\", and the British system as too unwieldy, and having a parliament with too much control over the monarchy; the French and Spanish models were rejected as tending toward despotism.\n\nIto was put in charge of the new Bureau for Investigation of Constitutional Systems in 1884, and the Council of State was replaced in 1885 with a cabinet headed by Ito as prime minister. The positions of chancellor (or chief-minister), minister of the left, and minister of the right, which had existed since the seventh century as advisory positions to the Emperor, were all abolished. In their place, the Privy Council was established in 1888 to evaluate the forthcoming constitution and to advise the Emperor.\n\nTo further strengthen the authority of the State, the Supreme War Council was established under the leadership of Yamagata Aritomo (1838–1922), a Chōshū native who has been credited with the founding of the modern Japanese army and was to become the first constitutional Prime Minister. The Supreme War Council developed a German-style general staff system with a chief of staff who had direct access to the Emperor and who could operate independently of the army minister and civilian officials.\n\nWhen finally granted by the Emperor as a sign of his sharing his authority and giving rights and liberties to his subjects, the 1889 Constitution of the Empire of Japan (or \"Meiji Constitution\") provided for the Imperial Diet (Teikoku Gikai), composed of a popularly elected House of Representatives with a very limited franchise of male citizens who were over twenty-five years of age and paid fifteen yen in national taxes, about one percent of the population, and the House of Peers, composed of nobility and imperial appointees; and a cabinet responsible to the Emperor and independent of the legislature. The Diet could approve government legislation and initiate laws, make representations to the government, and submit petitions to the Emperor. Nevertheless, in spite of these institutional changes, sovereignty still resided in the Emperor on the basis of his divine ancestry.\n\nThe new constitution specified a form of government that still was authoritarian in character, with the Emperor holding the ultimate power and only minimal concessions made to popular rights and parliamentary mechanisms. Party participation was recognized as part of the political process. The Meiji Constitution was to last as the fundamental law until 1947.\n\nIn the early years of constitutional government, the strengths and weaknesses of the Meiji Constitution were revealed. A small clique of Satsuma and Chōshū elite continued to rule Japan, becoming institutionalized as an extra-constitutional body of genrō (elder statesmen). Collectively, the genro made decisions reserved for the Emperor, and the genro, not the Emperor, controlled the government politically.\n\nThroughout the period, however, political problems usually were solved through compromise, and political parties gradually increased their power over the government and held an ever larger role in the political process as a result. Between 1891 and 1895, Ito served as Prime Minister with a cabinet composed mostly of genro who wanted to establish a government party to control the House of Representatives. Although not fully realized, the trend toward party politics was well established.\n\nOn its return, one of the first acts of the government was to establish new ranks for the nobility. Five hundred people from the old court nobility, former daimyo, and samurai who had provided valuable service to the Emperor were organized into a new peerage, the Kazoku, consisting of five ranks: prince, marquis, count, viscount, and baron.\n\nIn the transition between the Edo and Meiji periods, the Ee ja nai ka movement, a spontaneous outbreak of ecstatic behavior, took place.\n\nIn 1885, noted public intellectual Yukichi Fukuzawa wrote the influential essay \"Leaving Asia\", arguing that Japan should orient itself at the \"civilized countries of the West\", leaving behind the \"hopelessly backward\" Asian neighbors, namely Korea and China. This essay certainly encouraged the economic and technological rise of Japan in the Meiji period, but it also may have laid the intellectual foundations for later Japanese colonialism in the region.\n\nThe Meiji period saw a flowering of public discourse on the direction of Japan. Works like Nakae Chōmin's A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government debated how best to blend the new influences coming from the West with local Japanese culture. Grassroots movements like the Freedom and People's Rights Movement called for the establishment of a formal legislature, civil rights, and greater pluralism in the Japanese political system. Journalists, politicians, and writers actively participated in the movement, which attracted an array of interest groups, including women's rights activists.\n\nThe elite class of the Meiji period adapted many aspects of Victorian taste, as seen in the construction of Western-style pavilions and reception rooms called \"yōkan or yōma\" in their homes. These parts of Meiji homes were displayed in popular magazines of the time, such as \"Ladies' Graphic,\" which portrayed the often empty rooms of the homes of the aristocracy of all levels, including the imperial palaces. Integrating Western cultural forms with an assumed, untouched native Japanese spirit was characteristic of Meiji society, especially at the top levels, and represented Japan's search for a place within a new world power system in which European colonial empires dominated.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution in Japan occurred during the Meiji period. The industrial revolution began about 1870 as Meiji period leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan (O-yatoi gaikokujin).\n\nIn 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the Iwakura Mission toured Europe and the USA to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The Bank of Japan, founded in 1877, used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories.\n\nModern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas. Due to the importing of new textile manufacturing technology from Europe, between 1886 and 1897, Japan's total value of yarn output rose from 12 million to 176 million yen. In 1886, 62% of yarn in Japan was imported; by 1902, most yarn was produced locally. By 1913, Japan was producing 672 million pounds of yarn per year, becoming the fourth largest exporter of cotton yarn.\n\nThe first railway was opened between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1872; and railway was rapidly developed throughout Japan well into the twentieth century. The introduction of railway transportation led to more efficient production due to the decline in transport costs; allowing for manufacturing firms to move into more populated interior regions of Japan in search for labour input. The railway also enabled a new-found access to raw materials that had previously been too difficult or costly to transport. \n\nThere were at least two reasons for the speed of Japan's modernization: the employment of more than 3,000 foreign experts (called \"o-yatoi gaikokujin\" or 'hired foreigners') in a variety of specialist fields such as teaching English, science, engineering, the army and navy, among others; and the dispatch of many Japanese students overseas to Europe and America, based on the fifth and last article of the Charter Oath of 1868: 'Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of Imperial rule.' This process of modernization was closely monitored and heavily subsidized by the Meiji government, enhancing the power of the great zaibatsu firms such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi.\n\nHand in hand, the zaibatsu and government guided the nation, borrowing technology from the West. Japan gradually took control of much of Asia's market for manufactured goods, beginning with textiles. The economic structure became very mercantilistic, importing raw materials and exporting finished products—a reflection of Japan's relative poverty in raw materials.\n\nJapan emerged from the Tokugawa–Tennō (Keiō–Meiji) transition in 1868 as the first Asian industrialized nation. Domestic commercial activities and limited foreign trade had met the demands for material culture until the Keiō period, but the modernized Meiji period had radically different requirements. From the onset, the Meiji rulers embraced the concept of a market economy and adopted British and North American forms of free enterprise capitalism. The private sector—in a nation with an abundance of aggressive entrepreneurs—welcomed such change.\n\nEconomic reforms included a unified modern currency based on the yen, banking, commercial and tax laws, stock exchanges, and a communications network. Establishment of a modern institutional framework conducive to an advanced capitalist economy took time, but was completed by the 1890s. By this time, the government had largely relinquished direct control of the modernization process, primarily for budgetary reasons.\n\nMany of the former daimyo, whose pensions had been paid in a lump sum, benefited greatly through investments they made in emerging industries. Those who had been informally involved in foreign trade before the Meiji Restoration also flourished. Old bakufu-serving firms that clung to their traditional ways failed in the new business environment.\n\nThe government initially was involved in economic modernization, providing a number of \"model factories\" to facilitate the transition to the modern period. After the first twenty years of the Meiji period, the industrial economy expanded rapidly until about 1920 with inputs of advanced Western technology and large private investments. Stimulated by wars and through cautious economic planning, Japan emerged from World War I as a major industrial nation.\n\nIn 1885, the Meiji government sponsored a telegraph system, throughout Japan, situating the telegraphs in all major Japanese cities at the time.\n\nUndeterred by opposition, the Meiji leaders continued to modernize the nation through government-sponsored telegraph cable links to all major Japanese cities and the Asian mainland and construction of railroads, shipyards, munitions factories, mines, textile manufacturing facilities, factories, and experimental agriculture stations. Greatly concerned about national security, the leaders made significant efforts at military modernization, which included establishing a small standing army, a large reserve system, and compulsory militia service for all men. Foreign military systems were studied, foreign advisers, especially French ones, were brought in, and Japanese cadets sent abroad to Europe and the United States to attend military and naval schools.\n\nIn 1854, after Admiral Matthew C. Perry forced the signing of the Treaty of Kanagawa, Japanese elites took the position that they needed to modernize the state's military capacities, or risk further coercion from Western powers. The Tokugawa shogunate did not officially share this point of view, however, as evidenced by the imprisonment of the Governor of Nagasaki, Shanan Takushima for voicing his views of military reform and weapons modernization.\n\nIn 1868, the Japanese government established the Tokyo Arsenal. This arsenal was responsible for the development and manufacture of small arms and associated ammunition. The same year, Ōmura Masujirō established Japan's first military academy in Kyoto. Ōmura further proposed military billets be filled by all classes of people including farmers and merchants. The \"shōgun\" class, not happy with Ōmura's views on conscription, assassinated him the following year.\n\nIn 1870, Japan expanded its military production base by opening another arsenal in Osaka. The Osaka Arsenal was responsible for the production of machine guns and ammunition. Also, four gunpowder facilities also were opened at this site. Japan's production capacity gradually expanded.\n\nIn 1872, Yamagata Aritomo and Saigō Jūdō, both new field marshals, founded the Corps of the Imperial Guards. This corps was composed of the warrior classes from the Tosa, Satsuma, and Chōshū clans. Also, in the same year, the hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department. The samurai class suffered great disappointment the following years, when in January the Conscription Law of 1873 was passed. This law required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves. This monumental law, signifying the beginning of the end for the samurai class, initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki (blood tax) literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. Avoidance methods included maiming, self-mutilation, and local uprisings. The samurai were generally resentful of the new, western-style military and at first, refused to stand in formation with the peasant class.\n\nIn conjunction with the new conscription law, the Japanese government began modeling their ground forces after the French military. Indeed, the new Japanese army used the same rank structure as the French. The enlisted corps ranks were: private, noncommissioned officers, and officers. The private classes were: jōtō-hei or upper soldier, ittō-sotsu or first-class soldier, and nitō-sotsu or second-class soldier. The noncommissioned officer class ranks were: gochō or corporal, gunsō or sergeant, sōchō or sergeant major, and tokumu-sōchō or special sergeant major. Finally, the officer class is made up of: shōi or second lieutenant, chūi or first lieutenant, tai or captain, shōsa or major, chūsa or lieutenant colonel, taisa or colonel, shōshō or major general, chūjō or lieutenant general, taishō or general, and gensui or field marshal. The French government also contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks.\n\nDespite the Conscription Law of 1873, and all the reforms and progress, the new Japanese army was still untested. That all changed in 1877, when Saigō Takamori led the last rebellion of the samurai in Kyūshū. In February 1877, Saigō left Kagoshima with a small contingent of soldiers on a journey to Tokyo. Kumamoto castle was the site of the first major engagement when garrisoned forces fired on Saigō's army as they attempted to force their way into the castle. Rather than leave an enemy behind him, Saigō laid siege to the castle. Two days later, Saigō's rebels, while attempting to block a mountain pass, encountered advanced elements of the national army en route to reinforce Kumamoto castle. After a short battle, both sides withdrew to reconstitute their forces. A few weeks later the national army engaged Saigō's rebels in a frontal assault at what now is called the Battle of Tabaruzuka. During this eight-day-battle, Saigō's nearly ten thousand strong army battled hand-to-hand the equally matched national army. Both sides suffered nearly four thousand casualties during this engagement. Due to conscription, however, the Japanese army was able to reconstitute its forces, while Saigō's was not. Later, forces loyal to the emperor broke through rebel lines and managed to end the siege on Kumamoto Castle after fifty-four days. Saigō's troops fled north and were pursued by the national army. The national army caught up with Saigō at Mt. Enodake. Saigō's army was outnumbered seven-to-one, prompting a mass surrender of many samurai. The remaining five hundred samurai loyal to Saigō escaped, travelling south to Kagoshima. The rebellion ended on September 24, 1877, following the final engagement with Imperial forces which resulted in the deaths of the remaining forty samurai including Saigō, who, having suffered a fatal bullet wound in the abdomen, was honourably beheaded by his retainer. The national army's victory validated the current course of the modernization of the Japanese army as well as ended the era of the samurai.\n\nWhen the United States Navy ended Japan's sakoku policy, and thus its isolation, the latter found itself defenseless against military pressures and economic exploitation by the Western powers. For Japan to emerge from the feudal period, it had to avoid the colonial fate of other Asian countries by establishing genuine national independence and equality. Following the María Luz Incident, Japan released the Chinese coolies from a western ship in 1872, after which the Qing imperial government of China gave thanks to Japan.\n\nFollowing Japan's victory over China in the Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), Japan broke through as an international power with a victory against Russia in Manchuria (north-eastern China) in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. Allied with Britain since the Anglo-Japanese Alliance signed in London on January 30, 1902, Japan joined the Allies in World War I, seizing German-held territory in China and the Pacific in the process, but otherwise remained largely out of the conflict.\n\nFollowing the First World War, a weakened Europe left a greater share in international markets to the United States and Japan, which emerged greatly strengthened. Japanese competition made great inroads into hitherto-European-dominated markets in Asia, not only in China, but even in European colonies such as India and Indonesia, reflecting the development of the Meiji era.\n\nA key foreign observer of the remarkable and rapid changes in Japanese society during this period was Ernest Mason Satow, resident in Japan from 1862 to 1883 and 1895 to 1900.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The problem is not necessarily a straightforward one, for it may be possible to obtain nuclear precursors through the black market, and therefore relatively anonymously. Attribution to the source is desirable due to the trend of nuclear proliferation. Nuclear capability has expanded from only a couple of states, to where a terrorist group could make a bomb with only partial state backing. The United States has demonstrated its interest in nuclear attribution by passing the Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act, which calls for the development of attribution capabilities.\n\nA primary method used in nuclear attribution is nuclear forensics. The first step in this process is field work. Radiation levels can be quickly determined in the field using dosimetry. Reports from local survivors help provide visual evidence. The early data from the field, in addition to seismic data, can be used to establish that the bomb was actually nuclear and estimate its yield. The gathered samples will be shipped to laboratories and analyzed using isotope analysis and other methods. The isotopic signature can then be compared with known isotopic data and the likely history of the nuclear material can be pieced together.\n\nAnother aspect of nuclear attribution is the use of law enforcement and intelligence. This involves the monitoring of lost nuclear material, as well as known or suspected enrichment facilities. The latter is often done with satellite imagery. This data can be compared with the forensic evidence to increase the probability of accuracy.\n\nThe goal of nuclear attribution is to pinpoint the source of nuclear material with a credible level of accuracy. This faces a number of practical difficulties. First is that the lab work relies on comparing gathered samples to samples that have already been analyzed. Until there is significant international cooperation to develop a database, it will be difficult to specifically determine the source of the nuclear material. Analysis may consist more of places that are likely not to be the source, than specifically where it from. This will reduce its usefulness to political leaders who have to make quick decisions. Collecting the samples themselves will be difficult in the event of a nuclear explosion. The local infrastructure will likely be overwhelmed and may not be able to respondly quickly enough to gather fresh data. The environment will likely also be highly radioactive, especially if a dirty bomb is used. Getting trained humans on site could be prohibitively difficult. Another problem is that the process of nuclear attribution takes time. Political pressure could dictate a response from leaders far before the months it may take to conduct a full analysis of the source material.\n\n"}
{"id": "28978794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28978794", "title": "Oneilland", "text": "Oneilland\n\nOneilland () is the name of a former barony in County Armagh, present-day Northern Ireland. It covers the northern area of the county bordering the south-eastern shoreline of Lough Neagh. At some stage the barony was divided into Oneilland East and Oneilland West.\n\nThe barony of Oneilland—also recorded as Oneilan—derives its name from the anglicisation of the ancient Irish district of \"Uí Nialláin\", which was named after the Irish sept of the same name. Its territory however is based upon three such districts: \"Oneilan, Clanbrassil, and Clancann\". Clanbrassil and Clancann both lay along the southern shoreline of Lough Neagh, with the River Bann forming the boundary between them, with the former on the east side and the latter on the west side. Oneilan lay south of Clancann also west of the river.\n\nThe \"Uí Nialláin\" were a sept of \"Clan Cernaich\", and they ruled from \"Loch gCál\", modern-day Loughgall.\nAlong with the \"Uí Bresail\" and \"Uí Echdach\", they were amongst the main dynasties to arise from the split in the 8th century of \"Airthir\", one of the nine kingdoms of Airgíalla. The land of the \"Uí Echdach\" corresponded to the modern barony of Armagh. The land of the \"Uí Bresail\", recorded as \"Clanbrassil\" in English, as well as that of \"Clancann\" both lay in the modern barony of Oneilland East along the southern shore of Lough Neagh. The River Bann\n\nThe related \"Ó hAnluain\" (O'Hanlon) sept were for a couple of centuries chiefs of Oneilland, after which they ruled for several centuries as chiefs of a much reduced \"Airthir\", which by then corresponded to the modern baronies of Orior Lower and Orior Upper, which derive their name from it.\n\nThe \"Ó Gairbhith\" (O'Garvey) sept, who were kindred with the \"Ó hAnluain\", held sway in Clanbrassil before the \"Mac Cana\" (McCann) sept of \" Clan Cana\" (Clancann) took over. The \"Mac Cana\" would extend Clanbrassil to encompass all of Oneilland and what is now the barony of Dungannon Middle in County Tyrone. Clanbrassil was also recorded as \"McCan's Country\". The McCanns last residence in suggested as being in an area of land recorded in the plantation map near the shore of Lough Neagh called \"Maghery-Greny\".\n\nBy the 16th century the O'Neills of \"Tir Eoghain\" had taken over what was to become the barony of Oneilland. Due to the areas attractiveness it became a favourite retreat for members of the O'Neill family in times of peace and war. As The O'Neill resided at the clan's capital in Dungannon, Oneilland was set apart for his brother or eldest son, who resided in a crannog in Loughgall, which then was a more extensive lough. The O'Neill reserved for himself the right to temporarily stay at this residence.\n\nThus Oneilland became the territory of Art MacBaron O'Neill, son of Matthew O'Neill, 1st Baron Dungannon, with the area in a map from 1560 called \"Art Mac Baron his countree\". Art's younger half-brother, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, who eventually became head of the family thus having Dungannon as his residence seemed to favour residing in Loughgall.\n\nThe boundaries of the Plantation of Ulster precinct of Oneilland were conterminous with the barony. As part of the plantation, it was set aside for English undertakers only and due to the high fertility of the land and its closeness to The Pale it was the most sought after area.\n\nThe most notable native to be displaced by the English undertakers was Art MacBaron O'Neill. It was considered desirable by the government at the time to handle Art's removal carefully so that it would happen peacefully and thus inspire his kinsmen in Oneilland to react in kind. The council for the plantation in London decided that it would decide where to dislodge Art to, in which they granted him 2,000 acres in the neigbhbouring barony of Orior. Due to his advanced years Art gave little resistance and upon his peaceful acceptance of his proportion in Orior, saw many of his kinsmen in Oneilland do likewise.\n\nFor the purposes of plantation grants, Oneilland was divided into thirteen proportions granted to ten individuals: eight consisting of 1,000 acres; three consisting of 1,500 acres; and two consisting of 2,000 acres. Due to the gratuity of the planners so called waste or unprofitable land were thrown in meaning the undertakers may have ended up with far more land than they were intended to be given. In some cases this \"unprofitable\" land turned out to at times be more profitable than the arable land.\n\nThe English undertakers given the initial grants where: \n\nIn 1611 a report commissioned by the king to inspect the plantations in Ulster was carried out by Sir George Garew, in which Oneilland's progress was the most favourable. Despite this woodkerns—displaced natives—for three years launched raids on the plantation spreading fear and terror. Woodkerns are recorded as attacking from the dense forests of Clancann, Clanbrassil, and Oneilland, and other districts in County Armagh.\n\nIn 1608 Eochaidh Óg O'Hanlon, son and heir of Sir Eochaidh O'Hanlon, along with the son of the recently executed son of Brian Mac Art O'Neill of Loughgall, rose up in support of Sir Cahir O'Doherty of Inishowen, County Donegal, who had risen in rebellion against the British. Both Eochaidh Óg and O'Neill felt obliged to support O'Doherty due to family ties, with Eochaidh Og married to Cahir's sister Margaret. Their main opponent was their kinsman Sir Turlough MacHenry O'Neill of the barony of the Fews who captured the two men. The Lord Deputy of Ireland Chichester tried to blame the forests and Eochaidh Og O'Hanlon's rebellion in 1608 for the woodkern, however it was his own policies that was the problem.\n\nWhen the barony of Oneilland was split into two, the portion east of the River Bann corrsponding to the ancient district of Clanbrassil became Oneilland East, whilst the portion west of the river corresponding to the districts of Oneilland and Clancann became Oneilland West. Oneilland East consisted of 34,408 statute acres, whilst Oneilland West consisted of 59,502.\n"}

In the original tight-fitting style of the early 1980s, \"parachute\" referred to the pants' nylon material, similar to a parachute's. Parachute pants became a fad in US culture in the 1980s as part of the increased popularity of breakdancing. \n\nThe clothing company Bugle Boy manufactured the pants in the early 1980s, although they were not the first company to manufacture parachute pants. The company Panno D'or claims that they invented them, though this may not be true. However, it \"is\" true that Bugle Boy was the company that made them, seemingly overnight, immensely popular. Bugle Boy parachute pants are identifiable as having the word \"Countdown\" on a small tag above the rear pocket's zipper. \n\nTeenage boys were the main wearers of parachute pants. They typically cost $25-$30 a pair. During the height of their popularity, 1984-1985, boys wearing parachute pants became ubiquitous. Bugle Boy did make pants for girls and women, though they remained most popular with males. They went out of fashion almost as quickly as they arrived, with the fad lasting about two years. Their slim, fitted look was eventually overtaken by much looser, baggy-style pants. Parachute pants played a pivotal role in 1980s fashion.\n\nEarly breakdancers occasionally used heavy nylon to construct jumpsuits or trousers that would be able to endure contact with the breakdancing surface while at the same time decreasing friction, allowing speedy and intricate \"downrock\" routines without fear of friction burns or wear in clothing. Some, possibly apocryphal, sources state that genuine parachute nylon was cut and used to make such trousers possible. In the early part of the 1980s, parachute pants were tight fitting. Due to the use of nylon in parachutes, the style of pants became known as parachute pants. Often, early outfits were of a single color or slightly patchwork in nature as they were sometimes made of found materials.\n\nWhen manufactured and marketed as fashionable clothing, parachute pants were often constructed with lightweight synthetic fabrics, making this variety of pants more suitable for fashion than breakdancing.\n\n"}

{"id": "55289577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55289577", "title": "Pratt Ivories", "text": "Pratt Ivories\n\nThe Pratt Ivories, also known as the Acemhöyük Ivories, are a collection of furniture attachments produced in Anatolia in the early second millennium B.C. They were donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art between 1932 and 1937 by Mr. and Mrs. George D. Pratt. The group represents one of the most important assemblages of furniture fittings from the ancient Near East. In particular, a preserved set of four sphinxes, three lion legs, a falcon, and two recumbent gazelles, comprise the earliest and most complete evidence for a luxury chair or throne from the ancient world. Many of the other pieces in the group likely belonged to a number of small decorative objects.\n\nNone of the items gifted in these donations were scientifically excavated. Rather, they were purchased on the art market for the Pratt's extensive personal art collection. Mr. and Mrs. George D. Pratt subsequently donated the ivory pieces to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a series of four donations occurring between 1932 and 1937. The fittings were also accompanied by numerous clay sealings, terracotta objects, plates, and figurines. \n\nTwo of the ivory sphinxes and a plaque featuring a seated lion were given in the first donation in 1932. At the time, the sphinxes were interpreted as \"little ivory stool legs\" having been made by a Phoenician or Syrian craftsman for the Assyrian market. This assessment was largely based on their resemblance to pieces uncovered in excavations of the Assyrian capital, Nimrud. This comparison suggests a date of manufacture in the early first millennium B.C.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1937, following the death of her husband, Mrs. Pratt gave numerous other ivory pieces in three successive groups, eventually contributing sixty-six ivory objects, in addition to the three works donated in 1932. While these were immediately recognized as furniture attachments and fittings, scholars continued to debate the origin and date of their production. By 1936, M.S. Dimand, a curator in the Museum, challenged the initial assessment of the works, dating them to the end of the second millennium, around the 13th or 12th century B.C., and assigning their production to an \"unknown Aramaean art center in Northern Syria.\" \n\nApproximately three decades later, excavations at Acemhöyük in Turkey provided a conclusive answer to the question of the ivories' date and origin. Led by Nimet Özgüç, digging at the site began in 1962, revealing two monumental buildings dating to the early second millennium B.C. One of these structures, in the south-eastern region of the mound, was termed the Sarikaya palace. It had originally consisted of around fifty rooms before ultimately being destroyed by a large fire. Excavations of its rooms revealed numerous clay bullae, which had been baked by the conflagration. These sealings could be connected to known historical figures, which helped provide a date for the palace in the late 19th and 18th centuries B.C.\n\nIn 1965, excavations revealed other important finds. In room NA-OA/46, located in the western area of the palace, a small group of luxury items were uncovered. This group included several ivory objects. One of these was a wing, which matched those seen on the Pratt falcon. It would come to be understood that one of the wings presented on the falcon was in fact a replica produced by the museum, and that the Acemhöyük wing in fact belonged to the piece. Other items found were stylistically comparable to the Pratt ivories, including an ivory lion and panels bearing rosette and guilloche designs. Clay bullae matching those in the Pratt collection were also uncovered. Furthermore, later investigations by Machteld Mellink uncovered a photograph from an antiquities dealer in Antakya, which showed of two of the Pratt sphinxes. Reportedly these came from Aksaray, a town near Acemhöyük where items looted from the site were often brought to be sold. All of this evidence effectively demonstrated that the assemblage originated at this site, having been removed illicitly for sale on the antiquities market. The date and origin of the pieces are now understood to be 19th-18th century B.C. and of Anatolian production.\n\nAlthough the Pratt ivories cannot be fully understood due to the loss of their archaeological context, Elizabeth Simpson, through in depth analysis of the sphinxes and lion legs determined that the pieces were originally part of what had been a low throne or chair. Her reconstruction of the work, based on close investigation of the ivories' construction, reveals a chair with legs formed from the sphinxes and lion legs. The sphinxes are the lowest element, touching the floor and supporting the weight of the chair. The lion legs rest on top these, facing forward. The front two sphinxes also face forward, while those forming the back legs face outwards to the sides. The rest of the chair, including the frame, seat, backs, and stretchers, would have been made from fine wood.\n\nIt is likely that the falcon and gazelle panels, among others, decorated the back of the chair, in accordance with examples seen in Egypt from the 18th Dynasty. Other Pratt panels with rosettes and guilloche motifs may have originally been incorporated into the design of the chair, but unfortunately it is impossible to determine their exact arrangement. Sumptuous textile cushions on the seat would have completed the luxurious effect.\n\nExamination of the ivory pieces also revealed traces of gilding and inlay, indicating that the chair was further embellished with gold, silver, and precious or semi-precious stones. Based on this trace evidence, the sphinxes appear to have had dark, inlaid eyes and were decorated with applied gold and (perhaps) silver leaf. The platforms beneath the lion paws also appear to have been gilded. Traces of silver on the falcon suggest that it too was once covered. It is possible that even more extensive areas than those suggested by the remaining traces were once gilded, but that the fire reached temperatures high enough to burn off much the metal.\n\nThe color of the sphinxes and lion legs are also frequently commented upon in scholarship of the ivories. Variations in color occur among the pieces (gray, pink, orange, and red), resulting in pieces that match in form but not in color. These disparities are the result of varying conditions (i.e. the level of oxygen) in the fire that destroyed the palace. The ivories were covered with an iron-oxide rich clay slip, which reacted to these particular conditions, resulting in the color changes. Why the ivories were covered in this slip is another question. It is possible that the clay was applied to act as a bole, to assist in the application and burnishing of gold leaf. Simpson notes, however, that the slip occurs on the undersides and backs of the pieces, which would not have been gilded. Red ivory is also a decorative form attested to in texts of the period, which scholars have interpreted as meaning that ivory was often stained a reddish color. Perhaps in this case, the slip performed two functions, as a bole for applied gilding, and as a colorant for the exposed areas of ivory. \n"}

This field's potential has not only aided in developing a better understanding to many notable biographies throughout history, but has also inspired direction and insight into the field of psychology.\n\nOne of the first great examples of this field's utility was Dr. Henry Murray's report on the analysis of Adolf Hitler's personality during the end of World War II. Forced to psychoanalyze from a distance, Dr. Murray used multiple sources, including Hitler's genealogy, Hitler's own writings, and biographies of Hitler, so that the Allied forces could understand his personality to better predict his behavior. By applying a theory of personality that consisted of 20 psychogenic needs, Dr. Murray presumed Hitler's personality as \"counteractive narcism\", and was able to correctly predict the German leader's suicide in the face of his country's defeat. This work by Dr. Murray not only helped establish personality psychology as a behavioral science, but it also showed how the field of psychobiography could be applied as a means of psychoanalysis.\n\nSigmund Freud's analysis of Leonardo da Vinci (titled \"Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood\") is generally considered the first \"modern\" psychobiography. Persons who have been the subject of psychobiographical research include Freud, Adolf Hitler, Sylvia Plath, Carl Jung, Vincent van Gogh, Martin Luther, Abraham Lincoln, Elvis Presley, Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Andrew Jackson, and Richard Nixon.\n\nMajor psychobiographical authors include Erik Erikson, James William Anderson, Henry Murray, George Atwood, and William Runyan.\n\nMany psychobiographies are Freudian or psychodynamic in orientation, but other commonly used theories include narrative models of identity such as the life story model, script theory, object relations, and existentialism/phenomenology; and psychobiographers are increasingly looking for explanatory complexity through an eclectic approach.\n\nThough there were other psychobiographies written before Freud's \"Leonardo da Vinci and A Memory of His Childhood\" in 1910, it is considered the most significant contribution of its time, despite its flaws. Psychobiographies about William Shakespeare (Jones, 1910), Giovanni Segantini (Abraham, 1912), Richard Wagner (Graf, 1911), Amenhotep IV (Abraham, 1912), Martin Luther (Smith, 1913), and Socrates (Karpas, 1915) were also published between 1910 and 1915, but are not as well known. Between 1920 and 1926, psychobiographies of Margaret Fuller (Anthony, 1920), Samuel Adams (Harlow, 1923), Edgar Allan Poe (Krutch, 1926), and Abraham Lincoln (Clark, 1923) were published by authors from a psychoanalytic perspective without a background in psychoanalysis. During the 1930s Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Molière, Sand, Goethe, Coleridge, Nietzsche, Poe, Rousseau, Caesar, Lincoln, Napoleon, Darwin, and Alexander the Great were the subjects of psychobiographies, and soon afterward in 1943 a psychobiography of Adolf Hitler, predicting his suicide, was written during World War II, but was not published until 1972. Recent, significant contributions between 1960 and 1990 include psychobiographies of Henry James (Edel, 1953–72), Isaac Newton (Manuel, 1968), Mohandas Gandhi (Erikson, 1969), Max Weber (Mitzman, 1969), Emily Dickinson (Cody, 1971), Joseph Stalin (Tucker, 1973), James and John Stuart Mill (Mazlish, 1975), T. E. Lawrence (Mack, 1976), Adolf Hitler (Waite, 1977), Beethoven (Solomon, 1977), Samuel Johnson (Bate, 1977), Alice James (Strouse, 1980), Wilhelm Reich (Sharaf, 1983), and William James (Feinstein, 1984). Some psychobiographies at this time were also written about groups of people, focusing on an aspect they had in common such as American presidents, philosophers, utopians, revolutionary leaders, and personality theorists. These psychobiographies are the most well known, but since 1910 there have been over 4000 psychobiographies published.\n\nAs psychobiography gained recognition, authors from a variety of professions contributed their own work from alternate perspectives and varying methods of analysis of the psychobiographical subjects, significantly expanding psychobiography beyond the psychoanalytical perspective. Apart from psychoanalysts and psychiatrists who wrote the first psychobiographies, there have been historians, political scientists, personality psychologists, literary critics, sociologists, and anthropologists that have contributed to the growth of the field.\nPsychobiography has also conflicted with contemporary views of science since its origin because it contains no controlled variables or experimentation. In its early years it was dismissed as unscientific and not a legitimate addition to the field of psychology due to the push towards experimentation focused on physiological and biological factors, and away from philosophical psychology, to establish it as a natural science. The value of psychobiography to psychology is comparable to evolutionary psychology, archeology, and historical geology, offering detailed analyses of subjects with an emphasis on contextual information, but due to the qualitative nature of this information it remains a challenge to validate psychobiographical works as empirically based applications of psychology.\n\nThe discipline of psychobiography has developed various methodological guidelines for psychobiographical study. Some of the most prominent are these:\n\n\nScholars untrained in the discipline who do not follow these guidelines continue to produce psychobiographical studies.\n\nFreud's psychoanalytic approach (Freudian perspective) is not commonly used in its entirety in psychobiography, but it has had a lasting influence on the analysis of behavior in other areas of psychology. To sift through a lifetime of information and locate significant areas in the subject's development requires a system of identification, and psychoanalysis provided the base for this. Primacy, the initial exposure or experience, was recognized by Freud as an important factor in personality development and has remained an important aspect of personality psychology, psychotherapy, and psychobiography. Frequency, repeated exposure or actions, is also important, but its significance can vary. If the frequency of an action is low then it is seen as unimportant, and if the frequency is too high it becomes passive and overlooked, also becoming less important in psychobiography. Freud's knowledge of the importance of frequency is shown in the analysis of dreams, slips, errors, and humor by recognizing that repetition leads people to disregard these behaviors or stimuli. The importance of error in psychobiography, including slips and distortions, is also rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis and is used to identify hidden motives.\n\nElms has contributed to psychobiography through many published works including psychobiographies on Allport (1972), Freud (1980), Skinner (1981), and Murray (1987). He has also written about the subject of psychobiography in \"Psychobiography and Case Study Methods\" and \"Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology\" defining psychobiography and its methods, and explaining the value of psychobiography in psychology.\n\nPsychobiography has faced criticism from the very start, crystallised above all in the production of what Erikson caricatured as \"originology\"—the explaining away of significant public events and actions as the product of some minute childhood detail.\n\nBad psychobiography—using mechanical psychologising, a selective mining of the facts, overdeterminism, and a tendency to pathologise—is considered easy to write. Anna Freud condemned the study of Woodrow Wilson Freud himself co-authored with William Bullitt on just such grounds, and the haphazard historical evolution of the disciple has not helped reduce its prevalence.\n\n\n\n"}

It is most commonly used in the making of fur hats and coats, and is considered quite valuable today, although it was once a lower-priced commodity in the fur trade.\n\nThe hair of a rabbit can be divided into three types: \"longer, rectrix guard hairs, stiff at the base; the more numerous tectrix barbed hairs forming the major part of the coat, which share a hair follicle with the third type-the shorter hairs making up the undercoat.\" \nColloquially, these types are called\n\nA selectively bred rabbit from the 1900s, the Rex rabbit, has guard hairs of the same length as the down, but this is an atypical recessive trait that is relatively rare in wild rabbits.\n\nRabbit hair is commonly considered a byproduct of the ordinary process of breeding rabbits for meat, and as such is manufactured in vast quantities in England and France; more than seventy million pelts a year in France alone. However, the quality of fur from these rabbits tends to be low, as the rabbits are slaughtered before reaching twelve weeks old and still have the infant coat. The lower quality hair is sometimes used for felt.\n\nIn temperate climates, the highest quality furs are obtained in winter from rabbits over five months old, when the thickness of the fur is even; at other times of year, varying degrees of hair shedding causes uneven patches in the fur. The coat is also at its thickest at this time of year. The highest quality pelts are suitable for clothing, and typically constitute less than half of all pelts collected. The hair of the Angora rabbit is plucked or shaved and used as fiber, rather than as pelts.\n\nRabbit fur products have a tendency to shed more easily than some other furs and might not have the same longevity.\n\nThe use of rabbit pelts in the commercial fur trade took off in the 1920s, when it was incorporated into everything from hats to stoles, coats and baby blankets. By 1924, it accounted for half the US fur trade. While it was considerably cheaper than furs from other animals, it had softness and density and could also be dyed, plucked or sheared to look like other furs – shearing was also known as blocking.\n\nWhite pelts commanded a premium since they could be most easily dyed and in their natural state bore a close resemblance to much pricer ermine (stoat). New Zealand white rabbit (actually bred in the US) was highly prized, but other rabbit varieties in different hues – including Havana, Lilac and Checkered Giant were also valuable because they could be used in their natural colouring. One commentator noted in the 1920s: \"[W]here one sealskin coat graced Milady of Fifth Avenue in 1900, a hundred thousand coats of rabbit-seal are turned out on Sixth Avenue during the fur season for the Misses of Main Street all over America\".\n\nNames developed such as minkony, ermiline and northern seal – all of which were rabbit fur. After 1938, American fur coats had to be labelled using the name of the animal used in its making – for instance 'seal dyed coney' or 'beaver dyed rabbit' – in order to avoid confusion among consumers.\n\n\n"}

Flynn\n\nShirley Elaine Smith Flynn (February 7, 1929 – December 8, 2013) was an American author and local historian in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Her best-known book is a history of the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo, a popular event held annually since 1897. She was instrumental in the founding of the Cheyenne Frontier Days Old West Museum. In September 2008, Flynn was honored with a community service award from the \"Wyoming Tribune Eagle\".\n\nBorn in Spokane, Washington, Flynn was the oldest of four children of John Edward Smith and the former Ethel Valentine Grammer, who wed in Nebraska in 1928. She later moved to Cheyenne, where she graduated from Cheyenne Central High School, and thereafter from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nFlynn began her association with Cheyenne Frontier Days in the late 1960s as a volunteer during the time that her husband, Lloyd A. Flynn (1928–2002), a native of Bismarck, North Dakota, was a member of the rodeo general committee. Shirley Flynn was a member and secretary for the founding board of the Cheyenne Frontier Days Old West Museum, which opened in 1978 in a temporary cinderblock building. Flynn was the director of the museum from 1987 to 1991, during which time she helped to oversee the expansion of the museum in 1992. In 1980, Flynn researched and played the role of Mary Todd Lincoln in the first docudrama of the Old West Museum. She also lectured at schools, civic groups, clubs, and historical societies. In 1996, Flynn authored \"Let's Go! Let's Show! Let's Rodeo! The History of Cheyenne Frontier Days\" which chronicles the history of the event from its inception in 1897. According to the \"Wyoming Tribune Eagle\", she is considered an authority on the history of the rodeo and was a consultant for documentaries on the event. She wrote \"Cheyenne Frontier Days\", a work published in 1999 by the Wyoming State Library.\n\nIn addition to her works on Cheyenne Frontier Days, Flynn co-authored in 2001 with John Price \"Cheyenne's Historic Parks: From Untamed Prairie to a City of Trees\" and in 2002 with Bill Dubois \"The Plains Hotel\". With Dubois, Flynn co-authored centennial histories for the Greater Cheyenne Chamber of Commerce and St. Mark's Episcopal Church of Cheyenne, of which Flynn served in the altar guild for forty years. She penned articles for \"The Annals of Wyoming\", the magazine of the Wyoming Historical Society, including \"Wyoming Portrait: Renesselaer Schuler Van Tassel\" (spring 1999) and \"Cheyenne's Harry P. Hynds: Blacksmith, Saloon Keeper, Promoter, Philanthropist\" (summer 2001).\n\nIn September 2008, the \"Wyoming Tribune Eagle\" announced that Flynn would receive the newspaper's 11th annual \"Community Spirit Award\", which is presented to individuals \"with outstanding records of service\" to the Cheyenne community. L. Michael McCraken, the president and publisher of \"The Wyoming Tribune Eagle\", considered the award to Flynn to be particularly fitting because she had served as a consultant to the newspaper when the award was established in 1998. Flynn was also named to the \"Roll of Honor\" of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America. She received the \"National Preservation Medal\" from the Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\nFlynn died in 2013 at the age of eighty-four in a hospice in Cheyenne. She and her husband Lloyd have three surviving children: Carol Lamoin Flynn Rush (born 1954) and husband, John Benjamin Rush, of Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, Kathryn Elaine \"Kay\" Hauser (born 1955) of Washington, D.C., and Lloyd Rader Flynn (born 1956) of Riverton; there are five grandchildren.\n"}

Most often, a number of actors will participate in a single ceremony, taking on new stage-names. \n\nThese stagenames, most often those of the actor's father, grandfather, or teacher, are passed down between generations of actors' lineages, and hold great honor and importance. Many names are associated with certain roles or acting styles, and the new possessor of each name must live up to these expectations; there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name, but embodying the spirit, style, or skill of each actor to previously hold that name. Many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career, their participation in a \"shūmei\" representing their passage into a new chapter of their performing career.\n\nThe \"shūmei\" usually is followed by a performance significant to the actors' new names; these might involve larger parts, a new play, or roles traditional for actors with those names. For example, the stagename of Ichikawa Danjūrō is strongly associated with the role of the hero in the \"Shibaraku\" scene. Many of the twelve men to be called Ichikawa Danjūrō have excelled at this role, and so upon becoming the next Ichikawa Danjūrō, an actor may perform that role, which he never would have as a younger, less experienced actor with a different stagename.\n\n\n"}

The limestone stela with the inventory number JE 44865 is 43.5 × 39 cm in size and was discovered by Ludwig Borchardt in Haoue Q 47 at Tell-el Amarna in 1912. When the archaeological finds from Tell-el Amarna were divided on 20 January 1913, Gustave Lefebvre chose this object on behalf of the Egyptian Superintendency for Antiquities (the modern Supreme Council of Antiquities) instead of the Bust of Nefertiti.\n\nOn the left side Akhenaten sits on a stool, handing a jewel to his eldest daughter, Meritaten, who stands in front of him. Nefertiti sits opposite him, on the right hand side, playing with two of their daughters on her lap. These are Meketaten and Ankhesenpaaten. In the upper part, in the middle of the stela is the disk of the Aten, whose rays end in hands holding the symbol of life (Ankh) and are thereby depicted as life-bringing. In the background there are various inscriptions with the names and titles of the people depicted. The stela is bordered on three sides by a band of further hieroglyphs, marked with blue paint, which still partially survives. At the base of the stela are small holes on both sides which indicate that the stela was fitted with wings on each side.\n\nThe so-called \"Doctrinal name\" of the Aten used here is still in its first form. The stela's dating to the end of the first half of Akhenaten's reign follows from this, as well as the depiction of the daughters and stylistic features typical of the Amarna period.\n\nSuch stelae are typical of the Amarna period in Ancient Egypt and are found particularly in the graves at Amarna, which was the capital of Egypt under Akhenaten, with the name Akhetaten. These stelae were altars, which were placed in private chapels or houses for the worship of the royal family and the sun-god Aten.\n\nIn an interview for Der Spiegel in 2009 in connection with his claim that the Bust of Nefertiti is a forgery] [note that Krauss does not claim that the bust of N. is a fake] the Egyptologist Rolf Krauss maintained that the Stela of Akhenaten is also a forgery. As a basis for his view, Krauss claimed, among other things, that the word \"Maat\" (truth, justice) is written incorrectly in four places. He further criticised the depiction of Akhenaten as left handed, which in his view is contrary to ancient Egyptian iconography. The yellow weathering on the stone was claimed to be fake, not a patina, with the support of colour analysis. Another Egyptologist, Christian Loeben commented favourably, \"The relief is a pastiche, a fraudulently manufactured stylistic mishmash\"\n\n\n"}

The rebel groups were led by a combination of liberal democratic reformers and Islamists, who would later organize under the banner of the United Tajik Opposition. By June 1997, an estimated 20,000 to 100,000 people had been killed.\n\nOn 27 June 1997, Tajikistan president Emomalii Rahmon, United Tajik Opposition (UTO) leader Sayid Abdulloh Nuri and Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General Gerd Merrem signed the \"\"General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan\" and the \"Moscow Protocol\"' in Moscow, Russia, ending the war.\n\nTensions began in the spring of 1992 after opposition members took to the streets in demonstrations against the results of the 1991 presidential election. President Rahmon Nabiyev and Speaker of the Supreme Soviet Safarali Kenjayev orchestrated the dispersal of weapons to pro-government militias, while the opposition turned to rebels in Afghanistan for military aid.\n\nFighting broke out in May 1992 between old-guard supporters of the government and a loosely organized opposition composed of ethnic and regional groups from the Garm and Gorno-Badakhshan areas (the latter were also known as Pamiris). Ideologically, the opposition included democratic liberal reformists and Islamists. The government, on the other hand, was dominated by people from the Leninabadi region, which had also made up most of the ruling elite during the entire Soviet period. It was also supported by people from the Kulyab region, who had held high posts in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Soviet times. After many clashes, the Leninabadis were forced to accept a compromise and a new coalition government was formed, incorporating members of the opposition and eventually dominated by them. On 7 September 1992, Nabiyev was captured by opposition protesters and forced at gunpoint to resign his presidency. Chaos and fighting between the opposing factions reigned outside of the capital Dushanbe.\n\nWith the aid of the Russian military and Uzbekistan, the Leninabadi-Kulyabi Popular Front forces routed the opposition in early and late 1992. The coalition government in the capital was forced to resign. In December 1992 the Supreme Soviet (parliament), where the Leninabadi-Kulyabi faction had held the majority of seats all along, convened and elected a new government under the leadership of Emomali Rahmonov, representing a shift in power from the old power based in Leninabad to the militias from Kulyab, from which Rahmonov came.\n\nThe height of hostilities occurred from 1992–93 and pitted Kulyabi militias against an array of groups, including militants from the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRP) and ethnic minority Pamiris from Gorno-Badakhshan. In large part due to the foreign support they received, the Kulyabi militias were able to soundly defeat opposition forces and went on what has been described by Human Rights Watch as an ethnic cleansing campaign against Pamiris and Garmis. The campaign was concentrated in areas south of the capital and included the murder of prominent individuals, mass killings, the burning of villages and the expulsion of the Pamiri and Garmi population into Afghanistan. The violence was particularly concentrated in Qurghonteppa, the power base of the IRP and home to many Garmis. Tens of thousands were killed or fled to Afghanistan.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the opposition reorganized and rearmed with the aid of the Jamiat-i-Islami. The group's leader Ahmad Shah Masoud became a benefactor of the Tajik opposition. Later in the war the opposition organized under an umbrella group called the United Tajik Opposition, or UTO. Elements of the UTO, especially in the Tavildara region, became the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, while the leadership of the UTO was opposed to the formation of the organization.\n\nOther combatants and armed bands that flourished in this civil chaos simply reflected the breakdown of central authority rather than loyalty to a political faction. In response to the violence the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan was deployed. Most fighting in the early part of the war occurred in the southern part of the country, but by 1996 the rebels were battling Russian troops in the capital city of Dushanbe. Islamic radicals from northern Afghanistan also began to fight Russian troops in the region. A UN-sponsored armistice finally ended the war in 1997. This was in part fostered by the Inter-Tajik Dialogue, a Track II diplomacy initiative in which the main players were brought together by international actors, namely the United States and Russia. The peace agreement completely eliminated the Leninabad region (Khujand) from power. Presidential elections were held on November 6, 1999.\n\nThe UTO warned in letters to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and Tajik President Emomali Rahmon on 23 June 1997 that it would not sign the proposed peace agreement on June 27 if prisoner exchanges and the allocation of jobs in the coalition government were not outlined in the agreement. Akbar Turajonzoda, second-in-command of the UTO, repeated this warning on 26 June, but said both sides were negotiating. President Rahmonov, UTO leader Sayid Abdulloh Nuri and Russian President Boris Yeltsin met in the Kremlin in Moscow on 26 June to finish negotiating the peace agreement. The Tajik government had previously pushed for settling these issues after the two sides signed the agreement, with the posts in the coalition government decided by a joint commission for national reconciliation and prisoner exchanges by a future set of negotiations. Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov met with the Foreign Ministers of Iran, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to discuss the proposed peace accord.\n\nBy the end of the war, Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The number of those killed was estimated at anywhere from 30,000 to as many as 60,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside the country. Tajikistan's physical infrastructure, government services and economy were in disarray and much of the population was surviving on subsistence handouts from international aid organizations. The United Nations established a Mission of Observers in December 1994, maintaining peace negotiations until the warring sides signed a comprehensive peace agreement in 1997.\n\nJournalists were particularly targeted for assassination and dozens of Tajik journalists were killed. Many more fled the country, leading to a brain drain. Notable individuals murdered include journalist and politician Otakhon Latifi, journalist and Jewish leader Meirkhaim Gavrielov, politician Safarali Kenjayev and four members of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan: Yutaka Akino, a noted Japanese scholar of Central Asian history; Maj. Ryszard Szewczyk from Poland; Maj. Adolfo Scharpegge from Uruguay; and Jourajon Mahramov from Tajikistan; and documentary filmmaker Arcady Ruderman.\n\n\n\n"}

The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. The diary was retrieved by Miep Gies, who gave it to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only known survivor, just after the war was over. The diary has since been published in more than 60 languages.\n\nFirst published under the title Het Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 – 1 Augustus 1944 (\"The Annex: Diary Notes 14 June 1942 – 1 August 1944\") by Contact Publishing in Amsterdam in 1947, the diary received widespread critical and popular attention on the appearance of its English language translation \"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl\" by Doubleday & Company (United States) and Vallentine Mitchell (United Kingdom) in 1952. Its popularity inspired the 1955 play \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" by the screenwriters Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, which they adapted for the screen for the 1959 movie version. The book is included in several lists of the top books of the 20th century.\n\nThe copyright of the Dutch version of the diary, published in 1947, expired on 1 January 2016, 70 years after the author's death as a result of a general rule in copyright law of the European Union. Following this, the original Dutch version was made available online.\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Anne Frank received a blank diary as one of her presents on June 12, 1942, her 13th birthday. According to the Anne Frank House, the red, checkered autograph book which Anne used as her diary was actually not a surprise, since she had chosen it the day before with her father when browsing a bookstore near her home. She began to write in it on June 14, 1942, two days later.\n\nOn July 5, 1942, Anne's older sister Margot received an official summons to report to a Nazi work camp in Germany, and on July 6, Margot and Anne went into hiding with their father Otto and mother Edith. They were joined by Hermann van Pels, Otto's business partner, including his wife Auguste and their teenage son Peter. Their hiding place was in the sealed-off upper rooms of the annex at the back of Otto's company building in Amsterdam. Otto Frank started his business, named Opekta, in 1933. He was licensed to manufacture and sell pectin, a substance used to make jam. He stopped running his business while everybody was in hiding. But once he returned, he found his employees running it. The rooms that everyone hid in were concealed behind a movable bookcase in the same building as Opekta. Mrs. van Pels's dentist, Fritz Pfeffer, joined them four months later. In the published version, names were changed: The van Pelses are known as the Van Daans, and Fritz Pfeffer as Albert Dussel. With the assistance of a group of Otto Frank's trusted colleagues, they remained hidden for two years and one month.\n\nIn August 1944, they were discovered and deported to Nazi concentration camps. They were long thought to have been betrayed, although there are indications that their discovery may have been accidental, that the police raid had actually targeted \"ration fraud\". Of the eight people, only Otto Frank, the oldest, survived the war. Anne died when she was 15 years old in Bergen-Belsen, from typhus. The exact date of her death is unknown, and has long been believed to be in early March, a few weeks before the prisoners were liberated by British troops in April 1945. However, new research in 2015 indicated that Anne may have died in February.\n\nIn manuscript, her original diaries are written over three extant volumes. The first volume (the red-and-white checkered autograph book) covers the period between June 14 and December 5, 1942. Since the second surviving volume (a school exercise book) begins on December 22, 1943, and ends on April 17, 1944, it is assumed that the original volume or volumes between December 1942 and December 1943 were lost - presumably after the arrest, when the hiding place was emptied on Nazi instructions. However, this missing period is covered in the version Anne rewrote for preservation. The third existing volume (which was also a school exercise book) contains entries from April 17 to August 1, 1944, when Anne wrote for the last time before her arrest.\n\nThe manuscript, written on loose sheets of paper, was found strewn on the floor of the hiding place by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl after the family's arrest, but before their rooms were ransacked by the Dutch police and the Gestapo. They were kept safe, and given to Otto Frank after the war, with the original notes, when Anne's death was confirmed in the spring of 1945.\n\nThe diary is not written in the classic forms of \"Dear Diary\" or as letters to oneself; Anne calls her diary \"Kitty\", so almost all of the letters are written to Kitty. Anne used the above-mentioned names for her annex-mates in the first volume, from September 25, 1942 until November 13, 1942, when the first notebook ends. It is believed that these names were taken from characters found in a series of popular Dutch books written by Cissy van Marxveldt.\n\nAnne's already budding literary ambitions were galvanized on 29 March 1944 when she heard a London radio broadcast made by the exiled Dutch Minister for Education, Art, and Science, Gerrit Bolkestein, calling for the preservation of \"ordinary documents—a diary, letters ... simple everyday material\" to create an archive for posterity as testimony to the suffering of civilians during the Nazi occupation. On May 20, 1944, she notes that she started re-drafting her diary with future readers in mind. She expanded entries and standardized them by addressing all of them to Kitty, clarified situations, prepared a list of pseudonyms, and cut scenes she thought would be of little interest or too intimate for general consumption. By the time she started the second existing volume, she was writing only to Kitty.\n\nThere has been much conjecture about the identity or inspiration of Kitty, who in Anne's revised manuscript is the sole recipient of her letters. In 1996, the critic Sietse van der Hoek wrote that the name referred to Kitty Egyedi, a prewar friend of Anne's. Van der Hoek may have been informed by the publication \"A Tribute to Anne Frank\" (1970), prepared by the Anne Frank Foundation, which assumed a factual basis for the character in its preface by the then-chairman of the Foundation, Henri van Praag, and accentuated this with the inclusion of a group photograph that singles out Anne, Sanne Ledermann, Hanneli Goslar, and Kitty Egyedi. Anne does not mention Kitty Egyedi in any of her writings (in fact, the only other girl mentioned in her diary from the often reproduced photo, other than Goslar and Ledermann, is Mary Bos, whose drawings Anne dreamed about in 1944) and the only comparable example of Anne's writing unposted letters to a real friend are two farewell letters to Jacqueline van Maarsen, from September 1942.\n\nTheodor Holman wrote in reply to Sietse van der Hoek that the diary entry for 28 September 1942 proved conclusively the character's fictional origin. Jacqueline van Maarsen agreed, but Otto Frank assumed his daughter had her real acquaintance in mind when she wrote to someone of the same name. However, Kitty Egyedi said in an interview that she was flattered by the assumption, but doubted the diary was addressed to her:\n\nAnne had expressed the desire in the rewritten introduction of her diary for one person that she could call her truest friend, that is, a person to whom she could confide her deepest thoughts and feelings. She observed that she had many \"friends\" and equally many admirers, but (by her own definition) no true, dear friend with whom she could share her innermost thoughts. She originally thought her girl friend Jacque van Maarsen would be this person, but that was only partially successful. In an early diary passage, she remarks that she is not in love with Helmut \"Hello\" Silberberg, her suitor at that time, but considered that he might become a true friend. In hiding, she invested much time and effort into her budding romance with Peter van Pels, thinking he might evolve into that one, true friend, but that was eventually a disappointment to her in some ways, also, though she still cared for him very much. Ultimately, it was only to Kitty that she entrusted her innermost thoughts.\n\nIn her diary, Anne wrote of her very close relationship with her father, lack of daughterly love for her mother (with whom she felt she had nothing in common), and admiration for her sister's intelligence and sweet nature. She did not like the others much initially, particularly Auguste van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer (the latter shared her room). She was at first unimpressed by the quiet Peter; she herself was something of a self-admitted chatterbox (a source of irritation to some of the others). As time went on, however, she and Peter became very close, though she remained uncertain in what direction their relationship would develop.\n\nThere are two versions of the diary written by Anne Frank. She wrote the first version in a designated diary and two notebooks (version A), but rewrote it (version B) in 1944 after hearing on the radio that war-time diaries were to be collected to document the war period. Version B was written on loose paper, and is not identical to Version A, as parts were added and others omitted.\n\nThe first transcription of Anne's diary was in German, made by Otto Frank for his friends and relatives in Switzerland, who convinced him to send it for publication. The second, a composition of Anne Frank's versions A and B as well as excerpts from her essays became the first draft submitted for publication, with an epilogue written by a family friend explaining the fate of its author. In the spring of 1946, it came to the attention of Dr. Jan Romein and his wife Annie Romein-Verschoor, two Dutch historians. They were so moved by it that Anne Romein made unsuccessful attempts to find a publisher, which led Romein to write an article for the newspaper \"Het Parool\":\n\nThis caught the interest of Contact Publishing in Amsterdam, who approached Otto Frank to submit a Dutch draft of the manuscript for their consideration. They offered to publish, but advised Otto Frank that Anne's candor about her emerging sexuality might offend certain conservative quarters, and suggested cuts. Further entries were also deleted. The diary – which was a combination of version A and version B – was published under the name \"Het Achterhuis. Dagbrieven van 14 juni 1942 tot 1 augustus 1944\" (The Secret Annex. Diary Letters from June 14, 1942 to August 1, 1944) on June 25, 1947. Otto Frank later discussed this moment, \"If she had been here, Anne would have been so proud.\" The book sold well; the 3000 copies of the first edition were soon sold out, and in 1950 a sixth edition was published.\n\nIn 1986, a critical edition appeared, incorporating versions A and B, and based on the findings of the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation into challenges to the diary's authenticity. This was published in three volumes with a total of 714 pages.\n\nIn 1950, the Dutch translator Rosey E. Pool made a first translation of the Diary, which was never published. At the end of 1950, another translator was found to produce an English-language version. Barbara Mooyaart-Doubleday was contracted by Vallentine, Mitchell & Co. in England, and by the end of the following year, her translation was submitted, now including the deleted passages at Otto Frank's request. As well, Judith Jones, while working for the publisher Doubleday, read and recommended the Diary, pulling it out of the rejection pile. Jones recalled that she came across Frank's work in a slush pile of material that had been rejected by other publishers; she was struck by a photograph of the girl on the cover of an advance copy of the French edition. \"I read it all day\", she noted. \"When my boss returned, I told him, 'We have to publish this book.' He said, 'What? That book by that kid?'\" She brought the diary to the attention of Doubleday's New York office. \"I made the book quite important because I was so taken with it, and I felt it would have a real market in America. It's one of those seminal books that will never be forgotten\", Jones said.\nThe book appeared in the United States and in th United Kingdom in 1952, becoming a best-seller. The introduction to the English publication was written by Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1989, an English edition of this appeared under the title of \"The Diary of Anne Frank: The Revised Critical Edition\", including Mooyaart-Doubleday's translation and Anne Frank's versions A and B, based on the Dutch critical version of 1986. A new translation by Susan Massotty, based on the original texts, was published in 1995.\n\nThe work was translated in 1950 in German and French, before it appeared in 1952 in the US in English. The critical version was also translated into Chinese. As of 2015, the website of the Anne Frank Fonds records translations in over 60 languages.\n\nA play by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich based on the diary won the Pulitzer Prize for 1955. A subsequent film version earned Shelley Winters an Academy Award for her performance. Winters donated her Oscar to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam.\n\nThe first major adaptation to quote literal passages from the diary was 2014's \"Anne\", authorised and initiated by the Anne Frank Foundation in Basel. After a two-year continuous run at the purpose-built Theater Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the play had productions in Germany and Israel.\n\nOther adaptations of the diary include a version by Wendy Kesselman from 1997. Alix Sobler's 2014 \"The Secret Annex\" imagined the fate of the diary in a world in which Anne Frank survives the Holocaust. \n\nThe first German film version of the diary, written by Fred Breinersdorfer, was released by NBCUniversal in 2016. The film is derived from the 2014 Dutch stage production.\n\nIn May 2018, Frank van Vree, the director of the Niod Institute along with others, discovered some unseen excerpts from the diary that Anne had previously covered up with a piece of brown paper. The excerpts discuss sexuality, prostitution, and also include jokes Anne herself described as \"dirty\" that she heard from the other residents of the Secret Annex and elsewhere. Van Vree said \"anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile\", before adding, \"the 'dirty' jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all an ordinary girl\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Otto Frank recalled his feelings when reading the diary for the first time, \"For me, it was a revelation. There, was revealed a completely different Anne to the child that I had lost. I had no idea of the depths of her thoughts and feelings.\" Michael Berenbaum, former director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, wrote, \"Precocious in style and insight, it traces her emotional growth amid adversity. In it, she wrote, 'In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.'\"\n\nIn 2009, the notebooks of the diary were submitted by the Netherlands and included in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register.\n\nIt was reported around the world that in February 2014, 265 copies of the Frank diary and other material related to the Holocaust were found to be vandalized in 31 public libraries in Tokyo, Japan. The Simon Wiesenthal Center expressed \"its shock and deep concern\" and, in response, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga called the vandalism \"shameful.\" Israel donated 300 copies of Anne Frank's diary to replace the vandalized copies. An anonymous donor under the name of 'Chiune Sugihara' donated two boxes of books pertaining to the Holocaust to the Tokyo central library. After media attention had subsided, police arrested an unemployed man in March. In June, prosecutors decided not to indict the suspect after he was found to be mentally incompetent. Tokyo librarians have reported that Nazi-related books such as the diary and \"Man's Search for Meaning\" attract people with mental disorder and are subject to occasional vandalism.\n\nIn 2009, the armed group Hezbollah called to ban the book in Lebanese schools, arguing that the text was an apology to Jews, Zionism and the State of Israel.\n\nIn 2010, the Culpeper County, Virginia school system banned the 50th Anniversary \"Definitive Edition\" of \"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl\", due to \"complaints about its sexual content and homosexual themes.\" This version \"includes passages previously excluded from the widely read original edition... Some of the extra passages detail her emerging sexual desires; others include unflattering descriptions of her mother and other people living together.\" After consideration, it was decided a copy of the newer version would remain in the library and classes would revert to using the older version.\n\nIn 2013, a similar controversy arose in a 7th grade setting in Northville, Michigan, focusing on explicit passages about sexuality. The mother behind the formal complaint referred to portions of the book as \"pretty pornographic.\"\n\nThe American Library Association stated that there have been six challenges to the book in the United States since it started keeping records on bans and challenges in 1990, and \"Most of the concerns were about sexually explicit material\".\n\nAs reported in \"The New York Times\" in 2015, \"When Otto Frank first published his daughter's red-checked diary and notebooks, he wrote a prologue assuring readers that the book mostly contained her words\". Although many Holocaust deniers, such as Robert Faurisson, have claimed that Anne Frank's diary was fabricated, critical and forensic studies of the text and the original manuscript have supported its authenticity.\n\nThe Netherlands Institute for War Documentation commissioned a forensic study of the manuscripts after the death of Otto Frank in 1980. The material composition of the original notebooks and ink, and the handwriting found within them and the loose version were extensively examined. In 1986, the results were published: The handwriting attributed to Anne Frank was positively matched with contemporary samples of Anne Frank's handwriting, and the paper, ink, and glue found in the diaries and loose papers were consistent with materials available in Amsterdam during the period in which the diary was written.\n\nThe survey of her manuscripts compared an unabridged transcription of Anne Frank's original notebooks with the entries she expanded and clarified on loose paper in a rewritten form and the final edit as it was prepared for the English translation. The investigation revealed that all of the entries in the published version were accurate transcriptions of manuscript entries in Anne Frank's handwriting, and that they represented approximately a third of the material collected for the initial publication. The magnitude of edits to the text is comparable to other historical diaries such as those of Katherine Mansfield, Anaïs Nin and Leo Tolstoy in that the authors revised their diaries after the initial draft, and the material was posthumously edited into a publishable manuscript by their respective executors, only to be superseded in later decades by unexpurgated editions prepared by scholars.\n\nIn his will, Otto Frank bequeathed the original manuscripts to the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation. The copyright however belongs to the Anne Frank Fonds, a Switzerland-based foundation of Basel which was the sole inheritor of Frank after his death in 1980.\n\nAccording to the copyright laws in the European Union, as a general rule, rights of authors end seventy years after their death. Hence, the copyright of the diary expired on 1 January 2016. In the Netherlands, for the original publication of 1947 (containing parts of both versions of Anne Frank's writing), as well as a version published in 1986 (containing both versions completely), copyright initially would have expired not 50 years after the death of Anne Frank (1996), but 50 years after publication, as a result of a provision specific for posthumously published works (1997 and 2036, respectively).\n\nWhen the copyright duration was extended to 70 years in 1995 – implementing the EU Copyright Term Directive – the special rule regarding posthumous works was abolished, but transitional provisions made sure that this could never lead to shortening of the copyright term, thus leading to expiration of the copyright term for the first version on 1 January 2016, but for the new material published in 1986 in 2036.\n\nThe original Dutch version was made available free online by University of Nantes lecturer Olivier Ertzscheid and French parliament member Isabelle Attard.\n\nIn 2015, the Anne Frank Fonds made an announcement, as reported in \"The New York Times\", that the 1947 edition of the diary was co-authored by Otto Frank. According to Yves Kugelmann, a member of the board of the foundation, their expert advice was that Otto had created a new work by editing, merging, and trimming entries from the diary and notebooks and reshaping them into a \"kind of collage\", which had created a new copyright. Agnès Tricoire, a lawyer specializing in intellectual property rights, responded by warning the foundation to \"think very carefully about the consequences\". She added \"If you follow their arguments, it means that they have lied for years about the fact that it was only written by Anne Frank.\"\n\nThe Anne Frank Fonds' claim, however, only referred to the heavily edited 1947 Dutch edition, not to the original diary.\n\nThe foundation also relies on the fact that another editor, Mirjam Pressler, had revised the text and added 25 percent more material drawn from the diary for a \"definitive edition\" in 1991, and Pressler was still alive in 2015, thus creating another long-lasting new copyright. The move was seen as an attempt to extend the copyright term. Attard had criticised this action only as a \"question of money\", and Ertzscheid concurred, stating, \"It [the diary] belongs to everyone. And it is up to each to measure its importance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The idea of transnationalism can be traced back to 1991, when Ian Tyrrell pioneered this approach but it was in the field of American Studies, in the late 1990s, that the concept really was developed. Since then the term has been adopted by the field of history. \n\nAs the concept is still relatively new with the field of history, a consensus has not emerged on how to define the term precisely. However, Danish historian Nils Arne Sørensen emphasizes that an important feature of transnational history is to reject the nation state as the \"natural\" frame for historical analysis. This redirection of historical studies can be seen as countermove to the fact that the field of history was founded in the 19th century while the nationalist movement was on the rise in Europe. Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier define transnational history as having to do with the \"connections and circulations\" between societies in the modern age. Ian Tyrrell argues that transnational history is related to the Annales school. \n\n\n"}
