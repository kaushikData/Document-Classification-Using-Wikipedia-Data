The greatest military conflicts were the Thirty Years' War, the Great Turkish War, and the Dutch-Portuguese War. It was during this period also that European colonization of the Americas began in earnest, including the exploitation of the silver deposits, which resulted in bouts of inflation as wealth was drawn into Europe.\n\nIn the Islamic world, the Ottoman, Safavid Persian and Mughal empires grew in strength. In India \nThe Marathas dominated the political scene from the middle of the 17th century to the early 19th century as the Maratha Empire founded by Chatrapati Shivajiraje Bhosale. In Japan, Tokugawa Ieyasu established the Tokugawa shogunate at the beginning of the century, beginning the Edo period; the isolationist Sakoku policy began in the 1630s and lasted until the 19th century. In China, the collapsing Ming dynasty was challenged by a series of conquests led by the Manchu warlord Nurhaci, which were consolidated by his son Hong Taiji and finally consummated by his grandson, the Shunzi Emperor, founder of the Qing dynasty.\n\nEuropean politics were dominated by the Kingdom of France of Louis XIV, where royal power was solidified domestically in the civil war of the Fronde. The semi-feudal territorial French nobility was weakened and subjugated to the power of an absolute monarchy through the reinvention of the Palace of Versailles from a hunting lodge to a gilded prison, in which a greatly expanded royal court could be more easily kept under surveillance. With domestic peace assured, Louis XIV caused the borders of France to be expanded. It was during this century that English monarch became a symbolic figurehead and Parliament was the dominant force in government – a contrast to most of Europe, in particular France.\n\nBy the end of the century, Europeans were aware of logarithms, electricity, the telescope and microscope, calculus, universal gravitation, Newton's Laws of Motion, air pressure and calculating machines due to the work of the first scientists of the Scientific Revolution, including Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, René Descartes, Pierre Fermat, Blaise Pascal, Robert Boyle, Christiaan Huygens, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Robert Hooke, Isaac Newton, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. It was also a period of development of culture in general (especially theater, music, visual arts and philosophy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor changes in philosophy and science take place, often characterized as the Scientific revolution.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "230566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230566", "title": "America's Stonehenge", "text": "America's Stonehenge\n\nAmerica's Stonehenge is an archaeological site consisting of a number of large rocks and stone structures scattered around roughly within the town of Salem, New Hampshire in the United States. It is open to the public for a fee as part of a recreational area which includes snowshoe trails and an alpaca farm. It is a tourist attraction with particular appeal to believers in New Age systems.\n\nA number of hypotheses exist as to the origin and purpose of the structures. One viewpoint is a mixture of land-use practices of local farmers in the 18th and 19th centuries and construction of structures by owner William Goodwin in the 1930s. Some claim that the site has a pre-Columbian European origin, but this is regarded as pseudoarchaeological or the result of an early-20th century hoax. Archaeologist David Starbuck has said that \"it is widely believed that Goodwin may have 'created' much of what is visible at the site today\".\n\nThe site was first dubbed Mystery Hill by William Goodwin, an insurance executive who purchased the area in 1937. This was the official name of the site until 1982, when it was renamed \"America's Stonehenge\", a term coined in a news article in the early 1960s. The rebranding was an effort to separate it from roadside oddity sites and to reinforce the idea that it is an ancient archaeological site. The area is named after Stonehenge in England, although there is no cultural connection between the two.\n\nThe site first appears in print in the 1907 \"History of Salem, N.H.\": \nMany believe that Pattee built the site in the nineteenth century, and no unequivocal pre-Columbian European artifacts have been found there.\n\nThe site's history is muddled partly because of the activities of William Goodwin, who became convinced that the location was proof that Irish monks (the Culdees) had lived there long before the time of Christopher Columbus, and he sought to publicize the concept. The site has been altered by stone quarrying, and also by Goodwin and others who wanted to move the stones to what they considered to be their original locations; Goodwin might have been responsible for much of what can now be seen. Many of the stones have drill marks from the quarrying that took place on the site.\n\nMore fanciful origins have also been proposed, but artifacts found on the site led archaeologists to the conclusion that the stones were actually assembled for a variety of reasons by local farmers in the 18th and 19th centuries. For example, there is a so-called \"sacrificial stone\" which contains grooves that some say channeled blood, but it closely resembles \"lye-leaching stones\" found on many old farms that were used to extract lye from wood ashes, the first step in the manufacture of soap.\n\nIn 1982, David Stewart-Smith, director of restoration at Mystery Hill, conducted an excavation of a megalith found in a stone quarry to the north of the main site. His research team excavated the quarry site under the supervision of the New Hampshire state archaeologist and discovered hundreds of chips and flakes from the stone. They concluded that this was evidence of tool manufacture, consistent with American Indian lithic techniques, although no date could be ascertained. Archaeologist Clive Runnels stated, \"No Bronze Age artifacts have been found there, in fact, no one has found a single artifact of European origin from that period anywhere in the New World.\"\n\nAmerican horror writer H. P. Lovecraft was an enthusiast for New England megalith sites, and he visited Mystery Hill sometime between 1928 and the 1930s. The site is popularly attributed as inspiration for his story \"The Dunwich Horror\". Scholars, however, place Lovecraft's visit too late to have inspired the 1929 story.\n\nThe site was featured on an episode of the American History Channel TV series \"Secrets of the Ancient World\" which aired on January 14, 2002, in which Boston University archaeology professor Curtis Runnels refuted the theory that it was built by Celts in ancient history.\n\nThe site was also featured on the \"Strange Visitors\" episode of the \"In Search of...\" TV series which focused on investigating mysterious phenomena. The episode aired on April 24, 1977 as the second episode in the first season of the show.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22743271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22743271", "title": "Ancient shipbuilding techniques", "text": "Ancient shipbuilding techniques\n\nShip construction techniques can be categorized as one of hide, log, sewn, lashed-plank, clinker (and reverse-clinker), shell-first, and frame-first. While the frame-first technique dominates the modern ship construction industry, the ancients relied primarily on the other techniques to build their watercraft. In many cases, these techniques were very labor-intensive and/or inefficient in their use of raw materials. Regardless of differences in ship construction techniques, the vessels of the ancient world, particularly those that plied the waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the islands of Southeast Asia were seaworthy craft, capable of allowing people to engage in large-scale maritime trade.\n\nThe earliest archaeological evidence comes from dugout canoes found in peat bogs in Pesse, the Netherlands and dates to around 8000 years ago., Seafaring is found around the world, and many of these techniques are still in use today.\n\nSkin boats dominated seafaring in places that were scarce on wood, including the arctic and subarctic. They were made by stretching skin or leather over frames of wood or bone. These include kayaks and umiaks, coracles and currachs.\n\nBark canoes were made by stretching bark over wooden frames, and were used by Native Americans in North America.\n\nRafts were made where wood was available but not large enough to carve into dugouts and they could also be made from reeds. The earliest Egyptian boats were rafts made of papyrus; wooden boats did not replace rafts until the Gerzean/Naqada II Period.\n\nDugout boats were made wherever trees grew large enough to support them, including Holocene Europe, the West Coast of America, and Polynesian seafarers. Dugouts are defined as being carved out of a single piece of wood, and they could be elaborately decorated and quite seaworthy.\n\nThe shell-first technique involves constructing the \"shell\" of the boat first, then laying in the framework.\n\nInstead of using nails, the planks of a boat can be \"sewn\" together with rope. Evidence for the use of sewn-fastenings in plank boats has been found worldwide. Fastenings of this type have been demonstrated to perform well in coastal regions, being capable of withstanding the rigors of heavy surf as well as the impact of beaching. The lashed-plank technique can be found worldwide as well.\n\nThe clinker and reverse-clinker construction techniques involve fastening together an overlapping layer of planks with straight nails (clinker) or hooked nails (reverse clinker). The clinker tradition developed in Northern Europe, while the reverse-clinker technique, although very rarely found worldwide, has been found to be very prevalent among certain South Asian communities, such as that of Orissa in India.\n\nThis construction technique relied extensively on structural support provided by peg-mortise-and-tenon joinery through the shell of the boat. This method of ship construction appears to have originated from the seafaring nations of the Mediterranean, although evidence of peg-mortise-and-tenon joinery later appears in Southeast Asia.\n\nFrame-first construction involves laying down the framework of the vessel before attaching the planks to the boat. This is normally done by erecting a \"master frame\" in the center of the keel, and deriving the shapes of the other frames using a curved piece of wood stretched between the frame and the end posts, or through a geometric curve. The Yassiada wreck dating to the 7th century AD was long cited as the earliest evidence for frame-first construction technique, but two wrecks for Dor (Tanura) Lagoon in Israel dated to around 500 CE were built frame first. This technique was rarer in the rest of the world until the coming of the modern era.\n\n\n"}

This interest may be unacknowledged or not understood by the general public. The term is sometimes used synonymously with \"geek\" or \"nerd\", the Spanish term \"friki\", or the Japanese term \"otaku\", albeit referring to different niches.\n\nIn 1984 the \"Observer\" newspaper used the term as a metonym for the prototype group interested in detailed trivia, the trainspotters, as members of this group often wore unfashionable but warm Parka called \"Anorak\" when standing for hours on station platforms or along railway tracks, noting down details of passing trains.\n\nThe first use of the phrase to describe an obsessive fan has also been credited to the radio presenter Andy Archer, who used the term in the early 1970s for fans of offshore radio, who would charter boats to come out to sea to visit the radio ships.\nIn 1983, the first edition of the Anoraks UK Weekly Report was published, featuring news of pirate radio broadcasts.\n\nMichaela Simon saw a close connection between geeks (\"anoraks\") and high-functioning autism. Simon's article exhibits one of the rare uses of \"anorak\" as a synonym of nerd or spotter in the German language. Tony Attwood went as far as to write a book called \"Confessions of an Autism Anorak\", stating his own obsession with the topic. He explains further connections between autism as such and the anorak status in general, based on the \"extreme male brain\" theory of Simon Baron-Cohen.\n"}
{"id": "436948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436948", "title": "Argentine air forces in the Falklands War", "text": "Argentine air forces in the Falklands War\n\nThis article describes the composition and actions of the Argentine air forces in the Falklands War (), which comprised units of the Air Force, Army, Navy and other services.\n\nDespite initiating the war, Argentina had not prepared a plan for the subsequent defence of the islands. The military dictatorship that governed the country at the time regarded the seizure of the Falklands as a political act to obtain a diplomatic bargaining position, and not as an act of war. Consequently they were taken by surprise when the British responded with a large-scale mobilization, and a task force to retake the islands.\n\nThe Argentine Air Force (\"Fuerza Aérea Argentina\"; FAA) had never considered the possibility of waging a long-range naval air campaign against a major NATO power. It was not trained or equipped for such a mission. The FAA had only two tanker aircraft to serve the whole air force and navy, and its fighter-bomber Mirage IIIs and IAI Daggers were not equipped for aerial refuelling. The FAA's training, tactics and equipment were focused on a possible war against Chile, resulting from disputes such as the Beagle conflict.\n\nThe option to attack Chile was a cause of great concern to the Argentina military during the war. The Chilean armed forces had deployed a significant force to Chile's common border with Argentina, and the FAA was forced to reinstate their retired F-86 Sabres to bolster Argentina's air defences. In Argentina's favour, Peru immediately offered its support to the Argentine cause, with the Peruvian Air Force even offering to fly combat missions. This was politely declined by the Argentine government. As the war progressed, Peru and Venezuela sent critical aircraft spare parts to Argentina, urgently needed by the FAA and the Brazilian Air Force leased two EMB111 Bandeirantes maritime patrol aircraft to the Argentine Navy. Finally on June 4, ten Peruvian Mirage 5 with AS-30 missiles arrived to Tandil but the war ended before they could be used. Israel Aircraft Industries technicians that were in the country under the 1979 IAI Daggers contract continued their work during the conflict.\n\nBy the best estimates, Argentina totaled about 240 planes when the war broke out. About half of those were posted in the interior and along the Chilean border. The long distances from their bases prevented them from using their top speed or they risked running out of fuel. Although the Argentines had more aeroplanes than the British Task force, a good number of them were Pucara turboprops. Also, the A-4 Skyhawk force were dependent on the two available KC-130 tankers, limiting the amount of aeroplanes that could attack simultaneously.\n\nArgentina's fleet of A-4 Skyhawk attack jets was in very poor condition. The arms embargo placed by the United States in 1976, due to the \"Dirty War\", had made most airframes unusable. The involvement of Israel in helping to return the A-4 to full operational status has been alleged, but has never been confirmed.\n\nThe small air arm of the Argentine Navy (\"Armada Republica Argentina\"; ARA) was in the middle of the transition from the A-4Q Skyhawk to the new Super Etendard. Only five of the Etendard's anti-ship Exocet missiles had been delivered at the time of the conflict, at which point an arms embargo prevented the delivery of further shipments. Additionally, the required programming for the missiles to interact with the Etendard's computers had not been completed by French engineers when the conflict broke out. France, being an ally of the United Kingdom, recalled all technicians, which left Argentine scientists and electronic engineers to figure out a way to make the missiles take input from the plane's computers. Navy pilots, particularly those of the 3rd Naval Fighters Squadron flying \"A-4Qs\" were the only ones trained in bombing warships. Air Force pilots trained during April against the two Argentine Type 42 destroyers, similar to those of the British Fleet, and according to the Naval officers all the sorties were shot down, causing great concern to the High Command until the successful May 1 strikes which proved that aircraft could survive.\n\nFinally, Argentine military aviation had never been involved in an international conflict, indeed the last time the Argentine military had been involved in an international conflict was the War of the Triple Alliance more than a century before.\n\nIn spite of these disadvantages, Argentine air units bore the brunt of the battle during the six-week war, and inflicted serious damage and losses to the naval forces of the United Kingdom. Low-flying jets attacking British ships provided some of the most sobering and dramatic images of the war. By the end of the conflict, the British forces had come to admire the FAA's spirited conduct in the face of an effective air defence network. Admiral Sandy Woodward, the British Task Force commander said: \"[t]he Argentine Air Force fought extremely well and we felt a great admiration for what they did.\"\n\nThe British Operational Research Branch Report declassified and released to the public in February 2013 states: \nThe air units involved in the Falklands War were under the following chain of command:\n\nAir units moved from home bases to southern facilities. Amid fears about British/Chilean air strikes and/or SAS raids, Argentine aircraft were dispersed in the surrounding areas of their southern airfields, e.g., several parts of the national route #3 were used for this purpose.\n\n\nThe numbers in bold are the number of aircraft engaged in combat without counting those in reserve, the numbers in brackets are the number of aircraft lost during the war.\n\n\n (Argentine Naval Aviation)\n\n\n ( Argentine Army Aviation )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentine strike aircraft did not carry air-to-air missiles, with the exception of 8th Air Brigade Mirage IIIEA fighters and 6th Air Brigade Daggers on May 1. All retained a secondary armament of either 20 mm or 30 mm cannon.\n\n\n75 fixed-wing aircraft and 25 helicopters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "304187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304187", "title": "C. Vann Woodward", "text": "C. Vann Woodward\n\nComer Vann Woodward (November 13, 1908 – December 17, 1999) was a Pulitzer-prize winning American historian focusing primarily on the American South and race relations. He was long a supporter of the approach of Charles A. Beard, stressing the influence of unseen economic motivations in politics. Stylistically, he was a master of irony and counterpoint. Woodward was on the left end of the history profession in the 1930s. By the 1950s he was a leading liberal and supporter of civil rights. His demonstration that racial segregation was a late 19th century invention rather than some sort of eternal standard made his \"The Strange Career of Jim Crow\" into \"the historical Bible of the civil rights movement\", said Martin Luther King Jr. After attacks on him by the New Left in the late 1960s, he moved to the right politically.\n\nC. Vann Woodward was born in Vanndale, a town named after his mother's family and the county seat from 1886-1903. It was in Cross County in eastern Arkansas. Woodward attended high school in Morrilton, Arkansas. He attended Henderson-Brown College, a small Methodist school in Arkadelphia, for two years. In 1930 he transferred to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where his uncle was dean of students and professor of sociology. After graduating, he taught English composition for two years at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. There he met Will W. Alexander, head of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation, and J. Saunders Redding, a historian at Atlanta University.\n\nWoodward enrolled in graduate school at Columbia University in 1931 and received his M.A. from that institution in 1932. In New York, Woodward met, and was influenced by, W. E. B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, and other figures who were associated with the Harlem Renaissance movement. After receiving his master's degree in 1932, Woodward worked for the defense of Angelo Herndon, a young African-American Communist Party member who had been accused of subversive activities. He also traveled to the Soviet Union and Germany in 1932.\n\nHe did graduate work in history and sociology at the University of North Carolina. He was granted a Ph.D. in history in 1937, using as his dissertation the manuscript he had already finished on Thomas E. Watson. Woodward's dissertation director was Howard K. Beale, a Reconstruction specialist who promoted the Beardian economic interpretation of history that deemphasized ideology and ideas and stressed material self-interest as a motivating factor.\n\nIn World War II, Woodward served in the Navy, assigned to write the history of major battles. His \"The Battle for Leyte Gulf\" (1947) became the standard study of the largest naval battle in history.\n\nWoodward, starting out on the left politically, wanted to use history to explore dissent. He approached W. E. B. Du Bois about writing about him, and thought of following his biography of Watson with one of Eugene V. Debs. He picked Georgia politician Tom Watson, who in the 1890s was a populist leader focusing the anger and hatred of poor whites against the establishment, banks, railroads and businessmen. Watson in 1908 was the presidential candidate of the Populist Party, but this time was the leader in mobilizing the hatred of the same poor whites against blacks, and a promoter of lynching.\n\nWoodward's most influential book was \"The Strange Career of Jim Crow\" (1955), which explained that segregation was a relatively late development and was not inevitable. After the Supreme Court's decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\", in spring 1954, Woodward gave the Richards Lectures at the University of Virginia. The lectures were published in 1955 as \"The Strange Career of Jim Crow\". With Woodward in the audience in Montgomery, Alabama, in March 1965, Martin Luther King, Jr. proclaimed the book \"the historical bible of the Civil Rights Movement.\" It reached a large popular audience and helped shape the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nJim Crow laws, Woodward argued, were not part of the immediate aftermath of Reconstruction; they came later and were not inevitable. Following the Compromise of 1877, in the 1870s and 1880s there were localized informal practices of racial separation in some areas of society along with what he termed \"forgotten alternatives\" in others. Finally the 1890s saw white southerners \"capitulate to racism\" to create \"legally prescribed, rigidly enforced, state-wide Jim Crowism.\"\n\nScholars especially praised \"Origins of the New South, 1877-1913\", which was published in 1951 by Louisiana State University Press in a prominent multivolume history of the South. It combined the Beardian theme of economic forces shaping history, and the Faulknerian tone of tragedy and declension. He insisted on the discontinuity of the era, and rejected both the romantic ante-bellum popular images of the Lost Cause School as well as the overoptimistic business boosterism of the New South Creed. Sheldon Hackney, a Woodward student, hails the book, explaining:\n\nOf one thing we may be certain at the outset. The durability of \"Origins of the New South\" is not a result of its ennobling and uplifting message. It is the story of the decay and decline of the aristocracy, the suffering and betrayal of the poor whites, and the rise and transformation of a middle class. It is not a happy story. The Redeemers are revealed to be as venal as the carpetbaggers.\n\nThe declining aristocracy are ineffectual and money hungry, and in the last analysis they subordinated the values of their political and social heritage in order to maintain control over the black population. The poor whites suffered from strange malignancies of racism and conspiracy-mindedness, and the rising middle class was timid and self-interested even in its reform movement. The most sympathetic characters in the whole sordid affair are simply those who are too powerless to be blamed for their actions.\n\nWoodward taught at Johns Hopkins University from 1946 to 1961. He became Sterling Professor of History at Yale from 1961 to 1977, where he taught both graduate students and undergraduates. He did much writing but little original research at Yale, writing frequent essays for such outlets as the \"New York Review of Books\". He directed scores of PhD dissertations, including those by John W. Blassingame; former chair of the African American studies program at Yale; Daniel W. Crofts, former chair of the History Department at The College of New Jersey; James M. McPherson; Patricia Nelson Limerick, Professor of History at the University of Colorado at Boulder; Michel Wayne, Professor of History at the University of Toronto; Steven Hahn, Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania; John Herbert Roper, Richardson Chair of American History at Emory & Henry College; and David L. Carlton, Professor of History at Vanderbilt University.\n\nIn 1974, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary asked Woodward for an historical study of misconduct in previous administrations and how the Presidents responded. Woodward led a group of fourteen historians and they produced a 400-page report in less than four months, \"Responses of the Presidents to Charges of Misconduct\".\n\nIn 1978 the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Woodward for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. His lecture, entitled \"The European Vision of America,\" was later incorporated into his book \"The Old World's New World.\"\n\nWoodward won the Pulitzer Prize in 1982 for \"Mary Chesnut's Civil War\", an edited version of Mary Chesnut's Civil War diary. He won the Bancroft Prize for \"Origins of the New South\".\n\nPeter Novick says, \"Vann Woodward was always very conflicted about the \"presentism\" of his work. He alternated between denying it, qualifying it, and apologizing for it.\" British historian Michael O'Brien, the editor of Woodward's letters in 2013, says that by the 1970s:\n\nHe became greatly troubled by the rise of the black power movement, disliked affirmative action, never came to grips with feminism, mistrusted what came to be known as \"theory,\" and became a strong opponent of multiculturalism and \"political correctness.\"\n\nIn 1969, as president of the American Historical Association, Woodward led the fight to defeat a proposal by New Left historians to politicize the organization. He wrote his daughter afterwards, \"The preparations paid off and I had pretty well second-guessed the Rads on every turn.\"\n\nIn 1975-6 Woodward led the unsuccessful fight at Yale to block the temporary appointment of Communist historian Herbert Aptheker to teach a course. Radicals denounced his actions but a joint committee of the Organization of American Historians and the American Historical Association exonerated the process and found that there was no evidence that political criteria had been used. In 1987 he joined the conservative scholars who made up the National Association of Scholars, a group explicitly opposed to the academic Left. Woodward wrote a favorable review in the \"New York Review of Books\" of Dinesh D'Souza's \"Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus.\" It said that Duke University used racial criteria when it hired John Hope Franklin; Franklin and Woodward publicly feuded. Hackney says, \"Woodward became an open critic of political correctness and in other ways appeared to have shifted his seat at the political table.\"\n\nC. Vann Woodward died in Hamden, Connecticut in 1999.\n\nThe Southern Historical Association has established the \"C. Vann Woodward Dissertation Prize\", awarded annually to the best dissertation on Southern history. There is a \"Peter V. and C. Vann Woodward Chair of History\" at Yale; it is now held by southern historian Glenda Gilmore. (Peter was Woodward's son, who died at age 25 in 1969.)\n\n\n\n\n"}

In July 2013, Hank Green expressed his frustration with the ways YouTube had been changing and controlling its website.\n\nFunds from Google eventually ran out, and shortly after Green's \"A Chat with YouTube\" video, the VlogBrothers decided to launch \"Subbable\", a crowdfunding website where viewers can donate, monthly, to channels in return for perks. Donating is optional, as Hank Green stated, \"We ascribe to the idealistic notion that audiences don't pay for things because they have to but because they care about the stuff that they love and want it to continue to grow\". \"Crash Course\" was the first series and channel to be offered on \"Subbable\", and from this point onward, would be funded by the website. In March 2015, \"Subbable\" was acquired by \"Patreon\", and \"Crash Course\"'s crowdfunding was moved over to \"Patreon\".\n\nIn 2014, \"Crash Course\" announced a partnership with PBS Digital Studios. The partnership will introduce Benzine and Plait, who will host \"U.S. Government and Politics\", and \"Astronomy\", respectively. Hank Green also announced he will be hosting an \"Anatomy &\" \"Physiology\" series, and that another host will host an \"Economics\" series, as John takes a year-long break from the series.\n\nSome courses, presented by neither Hank nor John Green have been added to the \"Crash Course\" curriculum since it first began in 2012.\n\nOn March 25, 2016, the \"Crash Course\" YouTube channel uploaded a two-minute preview for \"Crash Course Games\". It covers the history of games and several types of games, including board games, video games, card games, role-playing games, sports, and more. The series was hosted by Andre Meadows and premiered April 1, 2016.\n\nOn April 6, 2017, a preview for \"Crash Course Film\" was uploaded. The series consists of three segments: \"Film History\" hosted by Craig Benzine, \"Film Production\" hosted by Lily Gladstone, and \"Film Criticism\" hosted by Michael Aranda. \"Film History\" covers the invention of cinema technology, the evolution of film language, and trends in filmmaking. \"Film Production\" covers the process of filmmaking and the roles of key crew members. \"Film Criticism\" analyzes titles including \"Citizen Kane\", \"Aliens\", \"Selma\", \"Do the Right Thing\", \"Apocalypse Now\", \"Moonlight\", and \"\".\n\nOn February 2, 2018, a preview for \"Crash Course Theater and Drama\" was uploaded. The first episode was uploaded on February 9 of the same year. The show was is hosted by Mike Rugnetta, and covers the history of theater throughout different cultures and time periods.\n\nJohn Green, one half of the VlogBrothers, began his \"Crash Course\" series on January 26, 2012, with \"World History\". As a collective, John has referred to the courses he teaches as \"Humanities.\"\n\nAs a result of a partnership with PBS Digital Studios, as well as John's decision to take a break from \"Crash Course\" in 2015, new hosts have been introduced to host the humanities courses: Craig Benzine (\"Government\"), Adriene Hill and Jacob Clifford (\"Economics\"), and Andre Meadows (\"Games\").\n\nHank's sixth series, \"Philosophy\", is also a humanities course, although it is produced by the team in Missoula who have traditionally produced the science series.\n\n\"Crash Course World History\" was the first series launched on the \"Crash Course\" channel, running from January 26 to November 5, 2012.\n\nOn January 26, 2012, the series launched with \"The Agricultural Revolution\" and a new episode aired on YouTube every Thursday. Throughout an episode, Green, the show's host and executive producer, elaborates on the topic presented at the beginning of the video. Raoul Meyer, an AP World History teacher and Green's former teacher at Indian Springs School, writes the show, with revisions and additions by Green.\n\n\"Crash Course World History\" features recurring segments such as \"The Open Letter,\" where Green reads an open letter to a historical figure, period, item, or concept. Occasionally Green converses with a naïve, younger version of himself whom he calls \"Me from the past\"; this character usually has naïve or obvious questions or statements about the topic. A running joke is that the Mongols are a major exception to most sweeping generalizations in world history. Mentions of this fact cue the \"Mongoltage\" (a portmanteau of \"Mongol\" and \"montage\"), which shows a drawing of Mongols shouting \"We're an Exception!\" followed by a three-second clip of a scene from the 1963 film \"Hercules Against the Mongols\" depicting a village raid.\n\nIn \"Crash Course World History\", Green frequently encourages his viewers to avoid looking at history through Eurocentric or \"Great Man\" lenses, but to be conscious of a broader historical context. \"Crash Course World History\", filmed in Indianapolis, has a broad following, having attracted millions of viewers. It has a particular appeal to American students taking the AP World History class and exam; many students and teachers use the videos to supplement their courses. Various episodes were featured in online news publications.\n\nAfter 42 episodes, \"World History\" concluded on November 9, 2012. On June 27, 2014, in a video preview, John Green announced \"World History\" would return for a second season, lasting 30 episodes. Ultimately, the second season ended on Apr 4, 2015. He made a few predictions about the future and also quoted at his last sentence: \"Also, thanks for watching this series. It has been amazingly fun to create, and we appreciate all of you.\"\n\nIn 2018, an Arabic-language edition of \"World History\", hosted by Yasser Abumuailek, launched. It is produced by Deutsche Welle and hosted on their Arabic YouTube channel.\n\nJohn's second series is \"Crash Course\" \"Literature\", which first aired as an eight-episode miniseries, from November 15, 2012. Works that have been covered include \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"The Catcher in the Rye\", \"The Great Gatsby\", and Emily Dickinson's poetry.\n\nIn February 2014, it was announced John Green would follow his \"U.S. History\" series with \"Crash Course\" \"Literature 2\". This second season began on February 27, 2014, and ran for 16 episodes, covering ancient works such as \"The Odyssey\" and \"Oedipus\" and novels like \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"Slaughterhouse-Five\", \"Frankenstein\", and \"Beloved\".\n\nIn January 2016, John announced that a third season of \"Crash Course Literature\" would air in the summer. This season will cover \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\", \"Invisible Man\", \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\", \"Sula\", \"Lord of the Flies\" as well as some Shakespearean sonnets.\n\nOn April 4, 2017 John Green revealed in a VlogBrothers video that \"Literature\" will be returning for a fourth series in Fall 2017; he mentioned \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" by George Orwell as a possible book to be covered. On June 22 of that year, at VidCon, the full list for the fourth season was announced: \"1984\", \"The Handmaid's Tale\", \"Parable of the Sower\", \"Candide\", \"Macbeth\", \"To the Lighthouse\", \"The Yellow Wallpaper\", and \"Pride and Prejudice\".\n\nOn the January 24, 2013, finale of the first season of \"Crash Course Literature\", John Green announced that it would be followed by \"Crash Course U.S. History\", beginning the following week on January 31, 2013 with \"The Black Legend, Native Americans, and Spaniards.\" Following in the tone set by \"World History\", Green puts an emphasis on maintaining an open and non-Western view of American History. A new segment called the \"Mystery Document\" replaces the \"Open Letter\"; Green takes a manuscript from the fireplace's secret compartment and reads it aloud, then must guess its author and the source work it is excerpted from. If he is incorrect, he is punished by a shock pen. Whilst the Mongoltage is largely absent, the \"Libertage,\" photos associated with America overtop an American flag with an electric guitar sound effect opening and ending with an explosion, appears whenever America's great national pride is referenced. The series ended on February 6, 2014. As with \"World History\", \"Crash Course U.S. History\" is written by Raoul Meyer.\n\nAs part of the partnership with PBS Digital Studios, Craig Benzine, known on YouTube as WheezyWaiter, was brought in to host the \"U.S. Government and Politics\" series. Benzine said that the course will provide an overview of how the government of the United States is supposed to function, and how it actually does function. He also said that the course will teach about \"the branches of government, politics, elections, political parties, pizza parties, and much, much more.\"\n\nThe series began on January 23, 2015, and ended on March 4, 2016.\n\nIn Hank's November 2014 announcement of the PBS partnership and the new series of \"Crash Course\" in 2015, he mentioned that a \"Crash Course Economics\" was in the works, but that it was not yet known who would present it. In February 2015, John announced that reporter Adriene Hill and high school teacher Jacob Clifford will host, and in July 2015, a preview video was released on the \"Crash Course\" channel. The series was launched on July 8, 2015, and finished on June 9th, 2016.\n\nOn January 18, 2016, Hank Green announced he would be hosting a new series about philosophy in February 2016. On February 8th, the first philosophy episode was released. \"Philosophy\" is the first course to have a corporate sponsor; Squarespace will present each episode. The series was launched February 8, 2016. The series is produced by the science-series team in Missoula, Montana, as the series focuses on issues in logic and the philosophy of science. The series ended on February 13, 2017.\n\nOn October 12, 2016, the \"Crash Course\" YouTube channel uploaded a 90-second preview for \"Crash Course Human Geography\". The course discusses what Human Geography isn't, and what it is, and will discuss humans in the context of their world. The series is hosted by Miriam Nielsen.\n\nA premiere episode was posted on October 19, 2016, and a second the following week; however, both were removed on October 27. John Green posted to Twitter that \"...we got important things wrong. We'll rework the series... And we'll bring a better series to you in a few months.\" On October 31, 2016, John Green explained that the videos were removed due to \"factual mistakes as well as too strident a tone.\" Green said it was caused by a rushed production stemming from staff and budgeting issues.\n\nIn a Reddit AMA in October 2017, John Green indicated the course may not return for some time, stating \"we don't feel like we've cracked it yet.\"\n\nOn February 17, 2017, a preview for \"Crash Course Mythology\" was uploaded. Hosted by Mike Rugnetta, the series began on February 24, 2017. It covers creation myths, pantheons, destruction myths, heroes, mythical places, creatures, objects, and myths in the modern world.\n\nHank Green began his \"Crash Course\" series with \"Biology\", on January 30, 2012. John referred to Hank's series as \"the science stuff\" counterpart to his humanities courses. As part of the partnership with PBS Digital Studios, additional hosts have been brought in to host recent series: Phil Plait (\"Astronomy\"), and Shini Somara (\"Physics\").\n\nA 2017 series, \"Computer Science\", is also a science course, although it is produced by the team in Indianapolis who have traditionally produced the humanities series.\n\nHank Green's first series, \"Crash Course Biology\", launched on January 30, 2012 with \"That's Why Carbon Is a Tramp,\" and a new episode aired on YouTube every Monday until October 22, 2012. The series used humor to blend entertainment into its educational content. A recurring segment on the program is titled \"Biolo-graphy,\" in which Green relays a short biography of a person who is usually associated with the topic of the overall episode. For the benefit of uncertain viewers, Hank Green links YouTube annotations to every specific subtopic he explains in the video at the conclusion of the episode (the annotations replay the video starting from the particular annotation the viewer selects). In July 2012, a \"Crash Course Biology\" episode discussing comparative anatomy was featured on a Mashable article.\n\nIn the final episode of \"Crash Course Biology\", Green revealed that the successor series, \"Crash Course Ecology\", would follow in the spirit of the \"Biology\" series. It premiered on November 5, 2012, and ran for 12 episodes.\n\nIn January 2013, Hank Green announced that his next series would be \"Crash Course Chemistry\", following a similar style to his previous \"Biology\" and \"Ecology\" series. He talked about the importance of chemistry to the world, and talked about the series in a brief 2-minute preview video. This series premiered on February 11, 2013.\n\nOn January 3, 2014, Hank Green teased the launch of a series on psychology, before launching it on February 3.\n\nOn January 15, 2014, Hank Green announced he would be hosting a new series about anatomy & physiology in 2015. The series began on January 6, 2015.\n\nPhil Plait began teaching a course on astronomy on January 15, 2015. Plait stated that the course, \"will cover basic topics in astronomy like motions in the sky, naked-eye observing, the planets, eclipses, stars, galaxies, and the whole Universe.\"\n\nOn January 29, 2016, the \"Crash Course\" Tumblr confirmed that the physics course will debut in late March, hosted by Shini Somara. A 2-minute preview video for \"Crash Course Physics\" was uploaded to YouTube on February 18, 2016. The series premiered March 31, 2016.\n\nOn February 15, 2017, a preview episode of \"Crash Course Computer Science\" was posted on the channel. It began on February 22 and is hosted by Carrie Anne Philbin.\n\nOn February 28, 2017, a preview for \"Crash Course Sociology\" was uploaded. It premiered on March 13 and is hosted by Nicole Sweeney.\n\nOn January 17, 2018, a preview for \"Crash Course Statistics\" was uploaded. It will premiere the following week and is hosted by Adriene Hill, returning after having co-hosted the \"Economics\" series.\n\nOn May 10, 2018, a preview for \"Crash Course Engineering\" was uploaded. It is hosted by Dr. Shini Somara, returning after having hosted the \"Physics\" series, and will run for 46 episodes.\n\nIn May 2014, John Green mentioned an upcoming 10-episode \"Crash Course\" season on Big History, funded by a grant from one of Bill Gates' organizations. The series first aired on the channel of the \"Big History Project\", rather than the \"Crash Course\" YouTube channel.\n\nOn August 19, 2014, the \"Big History Project\" channel began hosting episodes of a new co-hosted series, \"Crash Course Big History\". This outlines the history of existence, from the Big Bang forward into the evolution of life. Both Green brothers host the series, with Emily Graslie participating as a guest host.\n\nOn September 17, 2014, the first episode of \"Crash Course Big History\" was posted on the \"Crash Course\" YouTube channel, one month after its premiere on the \"Big History Project\".\n\nIn March 2017, Emily Graslie noted on her Twitter feed that she would be participating in a new \"Big History\" miniseries. The first episode of the second season was listed on the \"Crash Course\" channel on May 24, 2017; Graslie is the sole host for that season.\n\nIn February 2015, John Green announced that \"Crash Course\" producer Stan Muller would host a seven episode miniseries on intellectual property.\n\nOn February 23, 2015, a new series, \"Crash Course Kids\" was announced through a video preview on its own YouTube channel.

According to its description, this will consist of \"short, fully animated episodes [which] are going to pop up a few times a year and will shed light on amazing stories from past or current \"Crash Course\" subjects that for one reason or another didn't make it into the shows.\"\n\nDVD box sets of the complete run of the \"Biology\" series and of season 1 of \"World History\" were made available for pre-order on October 31, 2013. In June 2016, the show's official site launched, providing free offline downloads of all episodes of every series completed to date.\n\n"}
{"id": "93127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93127", "title": "Diné Bahaneʼ", "text": "Diné Bahaneʼ\n\nThis story forms the basis for the traditional Navajo way of life. The basic outline of begins with the (Holy Wind) being created, the mists of lights which arose through the darkness to animate and bring purpose to the four (Holy People), supernatural and sacred in the different three lower worlds. All these things were spiritually created in the time before the Earth existed and the physical aspect of humans did not exist yet, but the spiritual did.\n\nThe First or Dark World, , was small and centered on an island floating in the middle of four seas. The inhabitants of the first world were the four , the two Coyotes, the four rulers of the four seas, mist beings and various insect and bat people, the latter being the Air-Spirit People. The supernatural beings First Woman and First Man came into existence here and met for the first time after seeing each other's fire. The various beings started fighting with one another and departed by flying out an opening in the east.\n\nThey journeyed to the Second or Blue World, , which was inhabited by various blue-gray furred mammals and various birds, including blue swallows. The beings from the First World offended Swallow Chief, , and they were asked to leave. First Man created a wand of jet and other materials to allow the people to walk upon it up into the next world through an opening in the south.\n\nIn the Third or Yellow World, , there were two rivers that formed a cross and the Sacred Mountains but there was still no sun. More animal people lived here too. This time it was not discord among the people that drove them away but a great flood caused by when Coyote stole her two children.\n\nWhen the people arrived in the Fourth or White World, , it was covered in water and there were monsters () living here. The Sacred Mountains were re-formed from soil taken from the original mountains in the Second World. First Man, First Woman, and the Holy People created the sun, moon, seasons, and stars. It was here that true death came into existence via Coyote tossing a stone into a lake and declaring that if it sank then the dead would go back to the previous world.\n\nThe first human born in the Fourth World is who matures into Asdzáá Naadleehí, in turn, gives birth to the Hero Twins called and . The twins have many adventures in which they helped to rid the world of various monsters. Multiple batches of modern humans were created a number of times in the Fourth World and the gave them ceremonies which are still practiced today.\n\nOf a time long ago these things are said.\nThe first world was small, and black as soot.\nIn the middle of the four seas there was an island floating in the mist.\nOn the island grew a pine tree.\n\nDark ants dwelt there.\nRed ants dwelled there.\nDragonflies dwelled there.\nYellow beetles dwelled there.\nHard beetles dwelled there.\nStone-carrier beetles dwelled there.\nBlack beetles dwelled there.\nCoyote-dung beetles dwelled there.\nBats dwelled there.\nWhitefaced beetles dwelled there.\nLocusts dwelled there.\nWhite locusts dwelled there.\n\nThese were the twelve groups of the , the Air-Spirit People, who lived in the First World.\n\nAround the floating island were four seas. Each sea was ruled by a being. In the sea to the East dwelled , Big Water Creature, The One Who Grabs Things in the Water. In the sea to the south lived , Blue Heron. In the sea to the west dwelled , Frog. In the ocean to the north dwelled , Winter Thunder.\n\nAbove each sea appeared a cloud. There was a black cloud, a white cloud, a blue cloud, and a yellow cloud. The Black Cloud contained the Female spirit of Life. The White Cloud contained the Male spirit of Dawn.\n\nThe Black Cloud and the White Cloud came together in the East, and the wind from the clouds blew. From the breath of wind, First Man, , was formed and with him the white corn, , perfect in shape, with kernels covering the whole ear. Crystal, symbol of the mind and clear seeing, was with him.\n\nThe Blue Cloud and the Yellow Cloud came together in the West, and a wind from the clouds blew. From the breath of wind, First Woman, , was formed, and with her the yellow corn, perfect in shape, with kernels covering the whole ear. White shell, and turquoise, and yucca were there with her.\n\nFirst Man made a fire with his crystal. Its light was the mind's first awakening. First Woman made a fire with her turquoise. They saw each other's light in the distance.\n\nWhen the Blue Cloud and the Yellow Cloud rose high in the sky, First Woman saw the light of First Man's fire, and she went out to find it. Three times she was unsuccessful. The fourth time she found the home of First Man. \"I wondered what this thing could be,\" she said. \"I saw you walking and wondered why you did not come,\" First Man said. \"Why do you not come with your fire, and we will live together.\" First Woman agreed to this. So instead of the man going to the woman, as is the custom now, the woman went to live with the man.\n\nAnother person, , Great Coyote, was formed in the water. He told First Man and First Woman that he had been hatched from an egg, and knew all that was under the water and all that was in the skies. First Man believed him. Then a second coyote, , First Angry, appeared. He said to the three, \"You believe that you were the first persons. You are mistaken. I was living when you were formed.\" First Angry brought witchcraft into the world.\n\nThe Air-Spirit People became jealous of one another and began to fight. The rulers of the four seas, Blue Heron, Frog, White Thunder, and Big Water Creature could stand it no more, and told the beings of the island that they must all leave this world. Some climbed and some flew until they came to an opening in the sky. They crawled through it and into the Second World.\n\nFirst Man, First Woman, the Great-Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water, and the Coyote First Angry, followed by all the others, climbed up from the Dark World to the Second or Blue World.\n\nThey found a number of people already living there: bluebirds, blue hawks, bluejays, blue herons, and all the blue furred beings. The powerful swallow people lived there also. They lived in blue houses, scattered across a broad, blue plain. The swallow people said to the Air-Spirit People, \"You are welcome here among us.\" And for twenty-three days they all lived together in harmony. But on the night of the twenty-fourth day, one of the Air-Spirit People approached the wife of the swallow chief and wished to sleep with her.\n\nThe next morning the Swallow Chief, , said to the newcomers, \"We welcomed you here among us. We treated you as kin. Yet this is how you return our kindness. Now you must leave this world.\"\n\nThe Air-Spirit people wandered upward looking for a way into the next world. , The Wind, called to them from the South. They followed him and found a slit in the sky. First Man created a wand of jet and other materials and the Air-Spirit people flew or walked upon it up into the next world. One by one they passed through to the other side.\n\nThe bluebird had joined the Air-Spirit People and was the first to reach the Third or Yellow World. After him came the First Four and all the others.\n\nThe great Female River crossed this land from north to south. The great Male River crossed the land from east to west. The rivers flowed through one another in the middle, and the name of this place is , Crossing of the Waters.\n\nIn the Yellow World were six mountains. In the East was , Dawn, or White Shell Mountain. In the South was , Blue Bead, or Turquoise Mountain. To the West was , Abalone Shell Mountain. In the North was , Big Sheep Mountain. Near the Center of the Yellow World was , Soft Goods or Banded Rock Mountain. And near it, East of center, there was , Precious Stones, or Great Spruce Mountain.\n\nHoly People lived on the mountains. They were immortal, and could travel by following the path of the rainbow and the rays of the sun. One was , Talking God. His body was white. One was , Water Sprinkler. He was blue. One was , House God. His body was yellow. One was , Black God, the god of fire. Beyond them to the east lived Turquoise Boy, who was a , neither male nor female, who guarded the great male reed. And far to the West, on Abalone Shell Mountain, lived White Shell Girl, also a . With her was the big female reed, which grew at the water's edge with no tassel. \n\nIn the autumn, the four Holy People called to First Man and First Woman, and visited them, but they did not speak. Four days in a row they visited. On the fourth day, Black God said, \"You must cleanse yourselves and we will return in twelve days.\"\n\nFirst Man and First Woman bathed carefully and dried themselves with corn meal. They listened and waited. On the twelfth day the four Holy People returned. Water Sprinkler and Black God carried a sacred buckskin. Talking God carried two perfect ears of corn, with their points completely covered with kernels. One ear of corn was white, the male corn belonging to First Man. The other ear was yellow, the female corn belonging to First Woman. The gods placed one buckskin on the ground facing west, and on it they placed the two ears of corn with their tips pointing east. Under the white ear they put the feather of a white eagle. Under the yellow ear they put the feather of a yellow eagle. They told the people to stand at a distance so that the wind could enter.\n\nThe White Wind, blew between the buckskins, and while the wind blew, each of the Holy People walked four times around them, and the feathers were seen to move. In this way, they transformed First Man and First Woman from spirit people into human beings, with great powers. \"Now,\" the Holy People said, \"live here as husband and wife.\"\n\nAt the end of four days, First Woman gave birth to twins. They were neither male nor female, but . Four days later a second set of twins was born, one male and one female. After twenty days a total of five pairs of twins had been born, half of them male and half of them female. Almost at once they were full grown. The Holy People took each set of twins to their home on the East Mountain and taught them how to wear masks and pray, and then returned them to their parents. Eight winters passed, and during that time the twins found mates with the Mirage People. Many people came into being.\n\nNear , Crossing of the Waters, lived Spider Man and Spider Woman. They knew how to weave the fibers of cotton and hemp and other plants. First Woman asked Spider Man and Spider Woman to teach people how to weave the fibers of plants so they would not have to depend on animal skins for clothing. Cotton seeds were planted, and the cotton was gathered. Spider Man taught the people to shape a little wheel, 3 or 4 inches in diameter, and put a slender stick through it to spin the cotton. First Woman said, \"You must spin towards your person, not away, as you wish to have the beautiful goods come to you. If you spin away from you, the goods will depart from you.\" Spider Man named the spindle \",\" meaning \"turning around with the beautiful goods.\" Spider Woman said, \"No, it shall be called , turning around with the mixed chips.\"\n\nAfter they had spun the thread they rolled it into good-sized balls, and brought straight poles and tied them to make a rectangular frame. Spider Man wound the thread on two of the poles from east to west, over and under the poles. Then Spider Man said that the ball of thread should be called \",\" meaning \"rolling with the beautiful goods.\" Spider Woman said, \"No, it shall be called , rolling with the mixed chips.\"\n\nAfter the loom was finished the cross poles were erected and other poles placed on the ground to hold the loom frame solidly, and the loom was stretched into place. Spider Man said, \"It shall be called , raising with the beautiful goods.\" Spider Woman said, \"No, it shall be called , raising with the mixed chips.\"\n\nThere was a notched stick running across, with a notch holding every other thread. Spider Man said, \"It will be called , looping with the beautiful goods.\" Spider Woman said, \"No, it shall be called , looping with the mixed chips.\" Then they used a narrow stick about two and a half feet long, and wound the yarn or thread over it, and where there is no design they ran it along. That was given the same name as the ball of thread. They used the wide flat stick for tapping down the thread. Spider Man said, \"It shall be called ;\" but Spider Woman said, \"It shall be called .\"\n\nSpider Man then said, \"Now you know all that I have named for you. It is yours to work with and to use following your own wishes. But from now on when a baby girl is born to your tribe you shall go and find a spider web woven at the mouth of some hole; you must take it and rub it on the baby's hand and arm. Thus, when she grows up she will weave, and her fingers and arms will not tire from the weaving.\"\n\nOne day First Man brought home a fine deer that he had killed. First Woman said, \"I thank my vagina for this deer.\" First Man demanded to know what she meant. \"I mean that you bring me food because you wish to have sex with me,\" she said. \"But we women could live happily without men. We are the ones who gather the food and till the fields. We have no need of men.\" First Man grew angry and called all the men together. \"The women think they can live without us,\" he told them. \"Let us see if that is true.\"\n\nThe men and the two hermaphrodite twins crossed the river to the north bank carrying the grinding stones and bowls and baskets that the hermaphrodite twins had made, and the axes and hoes that the men had invented. The women bared themselves along the bank of the river and called out to the men, saying \"See what you are missing?\"\nThere were occasionally men and women who so longed after the other that some jumped into the river that separated them in a vain attempt to reunite with their loved ones. Unfortunately the currents of the river were too strong and the swimmers were washed down the river, never to be seen again.\n\nFor four years the men and the women lived apart. During this time the food that the women harvested became less, because they had no tools, while the men grew more and more food. But each group longed for the other. The women sought to satisfy themselves with bones and feathers and long stones. The men tried to relieve their longing with the fresh meat of animals. One man, , tried to satisfy himself using the liver of a deer. Owl called out to him to stop. \"This is wrong,\" Owl said. \"No good can come of this separation. You must bring the men and the women together again.\" As it turns out Owl was right. From the women who had sought to satisfy themselves with foreign objects, monsters were born out of this. The monsters would go on the terrorize the people wherever they roamed. \n\nBut a mother and her two daughters had been in the fields and had not seen the raft. Now it was dark, and they saw that all of the women had crossed the river to the men's side. They began to swim across. But , Big Water Creature, grabbed the two daughters and dragged them to her home under the water. For three days and three nights, the people searched the river for the girls, but they could not find them.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth day, Talking God and Water Sprinkler appeared with a large bowl of white shell and a large bowl of blue shell. The people gathered around them. They placed the bowls at the water's edge, and started to spin them. The spinning bowls created an opening in the water which led downward to a large house with four rooms. First Man and First Woman traveled down the passage and into the house, and behind them crept the Coyote named First Angry. In the north room of the house, they found Big Water Creature asleep in a chair. Her own two children were there, and also the two missing daughters. First Man and First Woman took the hands of the girls and led them back through the passage and on to the bank. Behind them, Coyote carried the two children of Big Water Creature, wrapped in his big skin coat with white fur lining. There was great celebrating because the lost girls were returned.\n\nThe next morning, animals began running past the village from the east. Deer ran by, and turkeys, and antelopes, and squirrels. For three days, animals ran past, fleeing from something. On the morning of the fourth day, the people sent locusts flying to the east to find out what was happening. The locusts returned and told that a great wall of water was coming from the east, and a tide of water from the north and from the south. The people ran to the top of the mountain . First Man ran to each of the other Sacred Mountains, took dirt from each, and summoned the Holy People, and returned to . Turquoise Boy came bearing the great Male Reed, and First Man planted it in the top of the mountain. All the people began to blow on the reed, and it began to grow and grow until it reached the canopy of the sky. Woodpecker hollowed out a passage inside the reed, and the people and Turquoise Boy and the four Holy People all began to climb up until they came out in the Fourth World.\n\nAfter the people had all emerged into the Fourth, or White World, they saw the water continuing to rise in the Third World beneath them. Big Water Creature pushed her head through the opening in the reed. Her curly hair floated on the water, and lightning flashed from her black horn and her yellow horn. First Man asked Big Water Creature why she had come. She said nothing. But the Coyote named First Angry came forward wearing his skin coat. He said \"Perhaps it is because of this,\" and drew the two babies from under his coat. Turquoise Boy took a basket and filled it with turquoise. On top of the turquoise he placed the blue pollen from blue flowers and yellow pollen from the corn, and pollen from water flags, and on top of these he placed the crystal, which is river pollen. This basket he gave to Coyote, who put it between the horns of the Big Water Creature, and on the basket he placed the two children. The Big Water Creature disappeared down into the reed, and the water with her.\n\nThey saw that they were on an island in the middle of a bubbling lake, surrounded by high cliffs. At first the people could not find a way to get across the water to the shore. They called on Water Sprinkler to help them. He had brought four great stones with him from the Third World. He threw one to the east. When it hit the cliff wall, it broke a hole through it, and water began to flow out of the lake. He threw a stone to the south. He threw one to the west. And to the north he threw one. Each stone created a hole in the cliff, and the water of the lake became lower. A lane now connected the island to the shore to the east, but it was deep with mud. The people called on , Smooth Wind, to help them. He blew steadily for a long time, and finally the people were able to leave the island.\n\nFirst Man and First Woman built a hogan to live in. It was not like a hogan of today. First Man dug a shallow pit in the earth and placed poles in it. For the main poles he used two parts of the Black Bow, . One pole he cut from the Male Reed. One pole he cut from the Female Reed. The structure was covered with earth and grass. First Woman ground white corn and they powdered the poles and sprinkled corn meal inside the dwelling from East to West. First Man said, \"May my home be sacred and beautiful, and may the days be beautiful and plenty.\" This was the first hogan-raising ceremony.\n\nInside, First Man lay with his head to the East, and First Woman lay with her head to the West. Their thoughts mingled, and those thoughts were sacred. They began to plan for the time that was to come, and how people would live on the earth. Great Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water came in to help them plan. Together, they planned that there should be a sun, a moon, and day and night. They decided to keep the other Coyote, First Angry, away from their planning, because it was he who had brought unhappiness.\n\nFirst Man, First Woman, and Great-Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water covered the floor of the hogan with a perfect buckskin. On the buckskin the placed a perfect round turquoise, larger than the height of a man. Below the turquoise they placed a great perfect white shell. At that moment the Coyote , First Angry, came and asked them what they were doing. \"Nothing,\" they said. \"So I see,\" he said. And he went away.\n\nFirst Man went looking for , The Black Yéʼii, known as the Fire God. First Man found him in a place where there was fire under the earth, and called to him. He returned to the first hogan with First Man. First Man and First Woman also summoned the other three Holy People, Water Sprinkler, House God, and Talking God. Together, they told Turquoise Boy and White Shell Girl that they were creating the sun and the moon. They asked Turquoise Boy if he would become the sun, and they asked White Shell Girl if she would become the moon. Again, the Coyote named First Angry came by and asked them what they were doing. \"Nothing,\" they said. \"So I see,\" he said, and he went away.\n\nFirst Man, First Woman, Great Coyote, and the Holy People planned that there would be 12 months. With each month, the moon would pass from dark to light, and the sun would move to a different path in the sky. White Shell Girl was given a whistle made from the Female Reed, with 12 holes in it. Each time she completed her cycle she would blow on the whistle, and a new month would begin. The first month was named , Back-to-Back, or Parting of the Seasons. Today it is called October. The second month was named , Time of Slender Winds. The third month was , Great Wind. It is the time to begin to tell the sacred stories. The fourth month, January, was , Crusted Snow. This is the month of many ceremonies, and the time for sacred stories. February, the fifth month, is , Baby Eagle. After this month, sacred stories must not be told to the young people. The sixth month, , is the month of Sudden Spring Storms. Ceremonies are held to bless the fields before seeds are planted. The seventh month was , Little Leaves. May, , was the eighth month. Finally they planned , When-Few-Seeds-Ripen, , Great Seed Ripening, , Little Ripening, and finally September, , Harvest Time, when foods are stored for the winter.\n\nAgain, the Coyote named First Angry came by and asked what they were doing. \"Nothing,\" they said. \"So I see,\" he said, and he went away.\n\nFire God, the Black Yéʼii, used his fire to heat the turqoise on the buckskin until it became red hot. Then they asked Turquoise Boy to enter the glowing turquoise. \"If I do that, I must be paid with the lives of the people of the earth, all the human beings, the animals which have four legs, the birds and insects of the air, the fishes and all the people under the water.\" And then the White Shell Girl repeated the same thing. First Woman, First Man, Great Coyote, and the Holy People all agreed. Then Turquoise Boy entered the glowing Turquoise. First Man used his crystal to heat the White Shell, and White Shell Girl entered the White Shell. Four circles were made around the inside of the hogan to complete the ceremony. In this way, Turquoise Boy became the sun, , The One Who Rules the Day. And White Shell Girl became the moon, , The One Who Rules the Night. , the East Wind, asked to carry the newly formed sun to his land so that it could begin its journey there.\n\nThe Coyote named First Angry appeared again. He said, \"I know you have been planning great things. I demand to know why I was not included in the planning.\" First Man and First Woman said nothing. Coyote said, \"You believe that I spoiled your living in the lower worlds, but it is not true. Now I will spoil your plans. The path of the sun and the path of the moon will not return to their beginning after 12 months. The twelve months of the sun will be 13 months of the moon. Sometimes frost will come early, and sometimes it will remain late. Sometimes the rains will not come, and you will have to summon the baby of the Big Water Creature to bring water.\" And he left them.\n\nLate in the first day, when was finishing his first journey across the sky, one of the hermaphrodite twins, , stopped breathing. Afraid, the people left her alone. In the morning, the Coyote named First Angry and the people went to find the twin, but was gone. One man looked down the reed into the Third World, and there he saw sitting by the side of the river combing her hair. He called to his friend, and he looked and also saw her. The people asked Coyote what to do. He took a black rock, , and threw it into , the Black Water Lake. He said that if the rock came up and floated, the spirit of the dead person would return to the Fourth World and there would be no death. If the rock sank, the spirit would stay in the world below and there would be death. The rock sank, and the people knew then that the twin was dead, and First Man remembered the agreement they had made with the sun. Four days later the two witnesses who had looked down on the dead twin also died. The people learned that it is dangerous to look at the dead. The people were all mad at Coyote for this and gathered around to beat him. Coyote said they could beat him, but first he had something to say. \"I threw the rock in the water knowing that it would sink.\" The people darkly muttered about this to one another, the whole of them deciding that Coyote really did deserve a good beating. But quick thinking Coyote finished his explanation. \"Without death the world would soon be overpopulated. The elders would never die and would stay stuck in their infirm bodies. There would be no room for new children. We would run out of food and shelter with so many people to feed and care for.\" The gathered group was silent for a bit while all of them contemplated Coyote's rationale and found him to be wise and intelligent.\n\nFirst Man, First Woman, Great Coyote, and the Holy People next planned stars for the night sky. They gathered as many pieces of , \"rock-star mica,\" as they could find, and put them on a blanket. Then First Man made a drawing in the dirt to plan the location of all the stars seeking to make the sky like a woven rug, orderly and balanced. , Black Yéʼii, placed the (North Star). First Man placed the (Big Dipper) while First Woman put the (Little Dipper) into the sky. First Man also placed the (Seven Stars, the Pleiades) which Black Yéʼii claimed represented parts of his body. They placed , the Big First One. They placed , Coyote's Feather, or the Slender One (the belt and sword of Orion). They placed , the children of and ; and , The-Old-Man-with Feet Apart; and the Rabbit Tracks, ; and Moving-toward-the-Dawn; and , The-Revolving-Male-Warrior-with-His-Bow-and-Arrow; and his wife, , Who-Carries-the-Fire-in-Her-Basket. The Coyote named First Angry returned to see what was going on. He took a piece of rock-star mica and placed it on the sky, and it became , known by Bilagáana as Canopus. He placed another piece in the south, , Morning Star. Then Coyote said, \"This is too long. I have a better way.\" He then snapped the blanket and the rest of the rock-star mica was scattered across the sky.\n\n, First Man, and , First Woman, together with , Water Sprinkler, and , Black Yéʼii, the god of fire, set out to create the six sacred mountains from dirt that First Man had brought up from each mountain in the third world. They placed them as they had been in the third world. They re-created , Dawn, or White Shell Mountain, in the East. They decorated it with white shells. They decorated it with white lightning. They decorated it with white corn. They decorated it with dark clouds that make male rain. From stones they had brought they fashioned , Rock Crystal Boy, and Tséghádiʼnídíinii atʼééd, Rock Crystal Girl, to reside there forever.\n\nIn the South they re-created , Blue Bead, or Turquoise Mountain. They adorned it with turquoise. They adorned it with dark mist. They adorned it with animals. They adorned it with light clouds that bring female rain. From two stones they had brought with them they fashioned , the Boy Who Is Bringing Back Turquoise, and , the Girl Who Is Bringing Back Many Ears of Corn. They were created to reside there forever.\n\nTo the West they re-created , Abalone Shell Mountain. They adorned it with haliotis shell. They adorned it with animals. They adorned it with dark clouds that bring the male rain. From material from the Third World they created , the White Corn Boy, and , the Yellow Corn Girl. They were created to reside there forever.\n\nIn the North they re-created , Big Mountain Sheep. They adorned that mountain with black beads. They adorned it with many plants. They adorned it with many animals. They adorned it with the grey mist that brings female rain. From materials from below, they fashioned , Pollen Boy, and , Grasshopper Girl. They were created to reside there forever.\n\nNear the Center they re-created , Soft Goods or Banded Rock Mountain. They left its summit bare, but they created two beings to reside there. They were , Boy Who Produces Goods, and , Girl Who Produces Goods.\n\nEast of center they re-created , Precious Stones, or Great Spruce Mountain. They decorated it with pollen and the clouds that bring female rain. On it they created two beings, , the Boy Who Produces Jewels, and , the Girl Who Produces Jewels, to live there forever.\n\nWhen all was done, First Man, First Woman, Black Yéʼii and Water Sprinkler returned and taught the people about the sacred mountains. They taught them that these six mountains were their principal mountains. From the lower mesa lands they could see them. Chants were made for them. Finally, a smoke was prepared for the mountains and the chants were sung.\n\nIn the Third World, there was a time when men and women had lived apart for a long time. During that time, some women had used animal horns or long stones or bird feathers for sex. Now, in the Fourth World, some of those women were pregnant. One woman who had used an antelope horn gave birth to a child with no head. The people held a council and decided that this baby would be abandoned. It was left to die in a gully. But it lived and grew to become , the Horned Monster.\n\nA woman who had used an eagle's feather for sex gave birth to a round, headless child with feathered shoulders. A council was held, and it was decided that this baby too should be abandoned. It was left in an alkali pit. But it lived, and grew to become , Monster Eagle. It made its home on \",\" a peak beyond La Plata Mountains.\n\nA woman who had used an elongated stone for sex gave birth to a headless child with hard skin and a pointed neck. The people met in council and decided that this baby should be abandoned in a fissure in a cliff. They placed the child and closed the fissure with rocks. But the child lived and grew to become , The Monster Who Kicks People Down the Cliff. It made its home at a place called \"Knol ghi nee,\" beyond the Carrizos Mountains.\n\nA woman who had skinned a sour cactus and used it for sex gave birth to twins, headless creatures with no limbs. They had two depressions at the top that looked like eyes. The people gathered and decided that these infants had to be abandoned. They threw them as far as they could. But the twins found shelter in brush and survived. They grew to become , the Monsters That Kill with Their Eyes.\n\nOne monster came about in a different way. A woman named Loose Running Woman went off alone in the direction of the sunrise. After defecating, she used a smooth pebble from the river to clean herself. She placed the warm stone in her genitals just as , the Sun, rose above the horizon. Seeing this, the Sun sent a ray into her. In only nine days she gave birth to a large child. Having no husband, and not knowing who the father of the child was, she abandoned the child in a rocky place. But knew that the baby was his, and he protected it from afar but never visited it. The child grew to be large and powerful and very angry. It was called , Big Giant, by the people.\n\nThe monsters hid along paths, and killed and devoured travelers. They killed many people, and the people began to live in fear.\n\nMost of the people had been killed. First Man said, \"Perhaps the Holy People will help us.\" In the morning, he saw a dark cloud covering the top of , the Great Spruce Mountain. In the night he saw a fire on the mountain. He said to First Woman, \"Someone is there. I must go to them.\" \"No,\" she said. \"There are many monsters between here and there. It is not safe for you.\" The following day the dark cloud remained on the mountain, and at night the fire appeared a second time. This happened the third day as well. On the fourth day, First Man said, \"I must go. I believe there is a Holy Person on the mountain who can help us.\" He set out for . As he walked, he sang: I am , and I head for in pursuit of old age and happiness. In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the lightning and approach the place where it strikes. In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the rainbow and approach the place where it touches the earth. In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the dark cloud's trail and approach the place where it is thickest. In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the scent of the rain, and approach the place where the lines of rain are darkest.\n\nAt the very summit of , he heard the cry of an infant and the crash of lightning, the pouring of rain, and he saw the tip of a rainbow with intense colors in front of the black sky. Suddenly the rain stopped and the sky became light. Where he had heard the cry of a baby there was a turquoise figure of a girl lying on the ground. First Man picked up the turquoise girl and carried it home with him.\n\nTwo days later First Man and First Woman were awakened very early in the morning by the sound \"Wu'hu'hu'hu'.\" They knew it was , Talking God. He told them they must return to the top of with the turquoise figure in twelve days.\n\nWhen they reached a level spot just below the summit of, was there waiting for them. , House God, was there. , Water Sprinkler, was there. With them was , the Wind. lay a perfect buckskin on the ground with its head facing the west. On the bucksin First Man lay the turquoise figure of a girl with her head to the west. Then placed another perfect buckskin over the figure, with its head facing East. The Holy People began to sing the sacred song of , and , the Wind entered between the buckskin blankets. The upper blanket was removed, and beneath it was a living baby girl. Her name was , Changing Woman. The Holy People told First Man and First Woman to take her to their home and raise her as their daughter.\n\nFirst Woman and First man carried to their hogan, and First Man made a cradle board and tied her in it. \"Now she will be my daughter,\" he said. First woman took the baby and breathed on her four times. \"Now,\" she said, \"she will be my daughter.\" At the end of the second day the baby laughed for the first time. The Coyote named arrived and said, \"I was told that my grandchild laughed for the first time.\" First Woman took charcoal and gave it to the Coyote saying: \"This is the only thing that lasts.\" He painted his nose with it and said, \"I shall know all things. I shall live long by it.\" Satisfied with the gift, he departed. Since then persons always receive a gift when a baby laughs for the first time, and the First Laugh Ceremony is performed.\n\nBy the thirteenth day, had become a young woman, and on that day she said to First Woman, \"Something unusual has passed through me.\" First woman said, \"That is your first race, .\" They covered the floor of the hogan with blankets, and Changing Woman lay on them face down. First Man pulled her hair down, and shaped her face, and dressed her in beautiful goods, beads, bracelets, and earrings, and tied her hair with a strip of perfect buckskin. Then First Man and First Woman stepped outside the hogan and told to run her first race around a cedar tree and return, from east to west, as the sun does. When she returned, they invited all the people to a sing over her in the hogan called , Changeable House, on the mountain called four days later. A great crowd gathered in the evening of the fourth day. A sweet corn cake was made from different colored corn meal sweetened with yeast. The Night Chant was sung, and in the morning the men received some of the maiden's cake as a gift for their chants, and , Changing Woman sat in the back of the hogan as gifts were piled in front of her. In this way the First Race of every young woman should be celebrated.\n\nSoon after that, Changing Woman wished for a mate. Every morning when the sun rose she lay on her back until noon, her head to the west and her feet to the east. At noon she went to the spring. She lay under the ledge and let spring water drip over her body. This took place each day for four days. On the fourth day, she heard a sound behind her and turned and saw a young man on a great white horse with black eyes. It had a long white mane, and pranced above the ground and not on the earth itself. The bridle and the saddle were white. The young man's moccasins and leggings were also white. The rider spoke: \"You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. Your wish could not have two meanings. Go home and tell your father to build a brush hogan to the south of your home. Fill a basket with meal and set it in the hogan. Make a line of pollen from east to west across the basket on top of the meal. Make a line of pollen from north to south drawn around the basket. You and your father must sit there late into the night. He will then go home to his wife and you must stay there alone.\"\n\nChanging Woman returned home and told what had happened to her parents. First Man said that it could not be true, but First Woman said that it was indeed the message of a Holy Being and they must obey. And so First Man and prepared the hogan and the basket and waited long into the night. Finally First Man returned home. When Changing Woman returned home in the morning, First Man asked her at once: \"Who came last night?\" The girl said, \"No one came, but some of the meal has been taken.\" The same thing happened the second night, and the third. On the morning after the fourth night, the girl told First Man, \"I saw no one, but someone touched me, and I was moved.\" Four days later, said, \"Mother, something moves within me.\" First Woman answered, \"Daughter, that must be your baby moving.\"\n\nOn the ninth day, Changing Woman felt her birth labor begin. Talking God appeared, carrying a rope of sunbeam. Water Sprinkler the Rain God appeared carrying a rope of rainbow. Saying nothing, the two beings gave one end of each rope to Changing Woman and silently bid her pull them with each spasm of labor. This began the custom of giving a rope to a woman who is in labor. A baby boy emerged, and Talking God took it aside and washed it, and severed its cord. A second baby boy emerged, and Water Sprinkler took it aside and washed it and severed its cord.\n\nAfter four days, , Talking God, and , Water Sprinkler, returned. The twins had already grown into big boys. \" (Grandsons),\" Talking God said, \"We have come to run a race with you.\" \"We will see how fit you have become,\" said Water Sprinkler. They agreed to race around the mountain. The boys ran fast, and the two Holy People ran slower. But soon the boys became tired and the Holy People came up behind them and began taunting them and whipping them with switches of mountain mahogany. As they approached home, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran past them and won the race. \"We will return in four days to race again,\" they said, and departed. In the evening, the boys were sore and tired. , the Wind came to them and said, \"Practice each day and grow stronger.\" In four days, Talking God and Water Sprinkler returned, and the four raced again around the mountain. It was a faster pace, but just as before, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran just behind the twins and whipped them with switches. Again the Holy People said they would return in four days to race again. And again in the evening came and encouraged them and urged them to train. Each day the boys trained, and in the third race, Talking God and Water Sprinkler no longer whipped the twins, but had to run their strongest to win the race at the end. Four days later they returned to race a final time. Again, the boys started very fast, but this time they did not tire and slow their pace. They led the whole way and won the race. \"Well done, ,\" said Talking God and Water Sprinkler. \"You have grown into what we wanted you to become. Now you can serve well those who have nurtured you.\"\n\nThe twins came to Changing Woman, , and asked, \"Mother, who is our father?\" \"You have no father,\" she said. \"We must have a father,\" replied the twins. \"We need to know who he is.\" \"Your father is a round cactus, then,\" said Changing Woman. \"Be still.\"\n\nFirst Man made bows and arrows for the twins, and they traveled to the south to hunt. They saw a large black bird on a tree, and tried to hit it with an arrow, but it flew away. When they told Changing Woman this, she said, \"That was Raven, and he may be a spy for , the Monster Bird, who devours our people. Do not go there again.\" The following day the boys took their bows and headed west. They saw a large black bird with a red head, and tried to kill it, but it flew away. When they told Changing Woman this, she said, \"That was Vulture. He may be a spy for , the Monster that Kicks People Down Cliffs. Do not go there again.\" The next day they boys traveled north, and there they saw a black and white bird with a piercing voice. They tried to shoot it with their arrows, but it flew away. When they told their mother, she said, \"That was Magpie. He is a spy for , the Monster Who Kills With His Eyes. If he sees you he will paralyze you with his eyes and peck you to pieces.\" Changing Woman cried, \"Now the monsters know about you, and they will come to kill you. You must stay inside.\"\n\nThe next morning Changing Woman climbed a hill. Looking in the distance she saw many monsters approaching from the south and from the west and from the north. She made four sacred hoops. The white one she threw to the east. The blue one she threw to the south. The yellow one she threw to the west. The black one she threw to the north. At once a strong wind began to circle the hogan. \"The wind is too strong for the monsters to enter,\" she told her sons. We will be safe for one day. But tomorrow the power will be gone.\" At night, the twins spoke softly to one another. \"The monsters are coming for us,\" they said. \"We must leave so the others will be safe.\" Before dawn, they left and ran down the holy path to the east.\n\nBy daybreak the twins were approaching the sacred mountain called . They saw smoke rising from the ground, and saw that it came from an underground chamber with a ladder extending. When they looked down into the entrance they saw an old woman sitting before a small fire. It was , Spider Woman. \"Enter, (my sons),\" she said in a raspy voice. \"Who are you and why do you walk on Atiin diyinii, the trail of the rainbow?\" The boys entered. \"We do not know who we are, and we do not know where we are going,\" said the twins. \"We are fleeing for our lives.\" \"You must tell me more,\" said Spider Woman. \", Changing Woman, is our mother, and we flee , the Alien Monsters,\" said the boys. \"You are welcome here, and you can learn much from me,\" said Spider Woman. \"But you must tell me more.\" \"We are yátashkii, raised without a father,\" the twins said. \"Perhaps our father is a round cactus. We follow the Holy Trail because the monsters will destroy us if they can.\"\n\n, Spider Woman, stood and extended her arms. \"I will tell you who your father is and how to go to him,\" she said, and she gestured to the first twin to sit on a chair of obsidian and to the second twin to sit on a chair of turquoise. She gave them food. Then she said, \"Your father is , the Sun. His dwelling is far to the east. The way is long and dangerous. Many monsters live between here and there. And your father may try to harm you.\" \"Tell us how to go there,\" said the twins. \"You must cross four dangerous places,\" said Spider Woman. You must pass the rocks that crush all travelers. You must cross the reeds that cut travelers to pieces. You must cross between the cane cactuses that cut travelers to shreds. Then you must pass the boiling sands that burn travelers to fine ashes. Beyond those four points no ordinary creature can pass. But I will give you a talisman that will help you.\" Saying this, she handed the boys the sacred , a hoop fashioned from the life feathers of monster eagles. \"Treat this charm carefully and use it correctly,\" she said. \"As you face your enemies, stare at them without fear, and extend the towards them. Then repeat this song:\n\"Rub your feet with pollen and rest them. Rub your hands with pollen and rest them. Rub your body with pollen and lie at rest. Rub your head with pollen and put your mind to rest. Then truly your feet become pollen. Your hands become pollen. Your body becomes pollen. Your head becomes pollen. Your spirit will then become pollen. Your voice will then become pollen. All of you is as pollen is. And what pollen is, that is what peace is. The trail ahead is now a beautiful trail. Long life is ahead. Happiness is ahead.\" \"Now,\" she said, \"You are ready to go on. You have the power that you need. Walk in beauty.\"\n\nThe twins continued east on the Trail of the Rainbow until they came to a narrow pass between two high cliffs. The cliffs pulled apart as they approached. They walked quickly to the opening and stopped suddenly, and the cliffs slammed together in front of them. \"We are the children of , the Sun,\" the twins called. We go to him with a message from Spider Woman.\" \"Tell us the message,\" called a voice. The boys held out the naayééʼ atsʼos and sang the song Spider Woman had taught them. The cliffs parted, and the twins passed safely between them. Next they came to the slashing reeds, and again they held out the and sang the holy song, and passed safely through. They came next to the cane cactuses, , which sprang to life as they approached. Again with the and the song of Spider Woman they passed through safely. At last they came to , the Boiling Dunes, which began to swirl and boil when they approached. \"We must know who you are and where you come from and where you are going and to what purpose,\" roared the dunes. \"We are the children of , the Sun,\" the twins called. We come from . We go to our father with a message from Spider Woman.\" They held out the , and sang the song of Spider Woman, and the dunes subsided. \"Continue on,\" the dunes said. \"Long life is ahead. Happiness is ahead.\" To the east the twins saw the turquoise dwelling of the Sun.\n\nThe twins entered the house of the Sun before had completed his journey across the sky. They saw a woman sitting against the western wall, and they saw two handsome young men, , Black Thunder, and , Blue Thunder. No one spoke to them. \"We are from ,\" the twins said. \"Our mother is , Changing Woman, and we have been told that , the Sun, is our father. We have followed the Holy Trail to seek his help.\" The woman remained silent. Black Thunder and Blue Thunder approached the twins, and wrapped four blankets around them. They wrapped them in the blanket of red dawn, and the blanket of blue daylight, and the blanket of yellow evening, and the blanket of black darkness. Then Black Thunder and Blue Thunder lifted the bundled twins and lay them high on a shelf.\n\nAfter a while the twins heard the Sun enter. He removed his glowing hot disk from his back and hung it on the wall. \"Who has come here today?\" he asked the woman. She did not answer. \"From above I saw two strangers come here,\" said . \"Where are they?\" The woman remained silent. \"I know that two strangers are here,\" said , \"And I demand to know where they are.\" \"Two young men did come here,\" said the woman, \"and they claim they are your sons. You have promised me that I am the only woman you see. So whose sons are these?\" and she went to the bundle and pulled on the blankets. The twins fell to the floor, and at once grasped the hoop of feathers that Spider Woman had given them. the Sun said, \"I will see if you are my sons,\" and he seized them at once and hurled them against the sharp spikes of white shell on the eastern wall of his house. The twins, holding the , bounced back unharmed. The Sun seized them again and hurled them against the turquoise spikes on his southern wall. Again they held the and bounced back unharmed. \"You must survive two more tests,\" said . He took them outside where there was a great sweathouse, and he started a fire to heat the four large rocks within it. While he did this, , the Wind, came up to the twins and whispered \"You must dig a tunnel to the outside and hide in it after you have answered his question.\" The twins dug the tunnel while the Sun prepared the fire, and hid its opening with a stone. The Sun then commanded them to enter the sweatlodge. After a while said, \"Is it hot in there?\" \"Yes,\" answered the twins, and then they hid in the tunnel they had dug. suddenly poured a great quantity of water through the hole in the top of the sweatlodge, and when it hit the hot rocks they exploded and hot steam hissed. After a while the twins crawled back into the sweatlodge. called, \"Is it hot in there?\" expecting to get no answer. But the twins answered, \"Not so hot as before.\" The Sun opened the door. \"Perhaps you truly are my sons,\" he said. \"Come inside, and we will smoke.\"\n\nHe turned and entered his house. As he did, , the Wind, came up beside the twins. \"The tobacco is poisonous,\" he whispered. \"The spittle of , the spiny caterpillar will protect you.\" At once the twins saw a spiny caterpillar on the path, and took some of its spittle into their mouths. Inside, , the Sun, brought forth a turquoise pipe from a high shelf on his eastern wall and lit it with the red sun disk. He puffed on it himself, and then passed it to the twins, who each puffed on it themselves. \"What sweet tobacco,\" said the twins. Seeing this, the Sun said, \"Truly you are my sons. Now tell me why you have come.\" \"Father,\" they said, \"we have come because , the Alien Monsters, are killing all our people. the Big Giant devours our people. , the Horned Monster, devours them. , the Bird Monster, devours them, and so does , who kills with his eyes. Give us weapons so that we may destroy and the others.\"\n\nWhen the Sun left on his journey across the top of the sky the next morning, he took the twins with him. At noon they came to , the hole at the top of the sky. \"Now show me where you live,\" said the Sun. With the help of , the Wind, the twins, pointed out the four sacred mountains of the four directions, and , the Travelers' Circle Mountain, near the center. \"We live near there,\" they said. \"All that you have told me I now know to be true, my sons,\" said . \"You will succeed against the Monsters, and in your war against them you will make the final passage from boyhood to manhood.\" Then he sent down a streak of lightning onto the top of , the Blue Bead Mountain that was the home of , the Big Giant, and the twins slid down it.\n\nIt is said that the twin sons of Jóhonaaʼéí descended from the sky to the top of , the Blue Bead Mountain, and came down the mountain on its south slope. They walked on to , which some call Warm Spring. There they found , the Holy Boy, and , Spirit Girl. \"Where are you going?\" asked Holy Boy. \"We have come to find , the Big Giant,\" said the twins. \"He is huge, and very powerful,\" said Holy Boy. \"Each day he comes late in the day to , to drink from the lake.\" The next day at dawn the brothers walked to and stood beside the large lake. They took one of the chain lightning arrows their father had given them and shot it at a slab of high rock overhanging the base of Tsoodził. The arrow struck the rock with such force that it shattered and fell where it remains today. \"With such weapons as these we cannot fail,\" they said.\n\nLate in the day they heard , the Big Giant, approaching. His footsteps shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink. He drank deeply four times, until most of the water was gone from the lake. Then he saw the reflection of the twins in the water, and stood and stared at them. he shouted. The twins did not understand, but answered, Then paced back and forth and said, \"What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?\" The twins shouted back, \"What beautiful Big Thing is walking about? And how shall we kill it?\" , the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly , the Wind, called \"Akóóh! Beware! Jump!\" and suddenly the twins found themselves standing on the end of a rainbow, just as , the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them. The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet. , the Wind, whispered \"Keep low now!\" and hurled his great blue knife. It passed over them. The Wind said, \"Jump to the right!\" and the great yellow knife of passed just to their left. \"This is his last weapon,\" whispered the Wind. \"Jump to the left. Now!\" The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them.\" The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding flash of lightning came out of the sky and struck the Giant on the side of the head. The heavens shook with the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet. Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at . The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again. The second brother then shot an arrow of sheet lightning which struck the giant in the chest. He fell to both knees and began to fall forward, catching himself with his hands. Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head. fell face down on the ground. Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and , the Wind said, \"Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!\" The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.\n\nThe twins approached the body of the Giant and saw that he was dead. The younger brother removed the Giant's scalp as proof. Around his body lay many chips of flint from his armor. The twins hurled the flint in each of the four directions, saying, \"From now on the people of the earth shall use you.\" Then the older brother said to the young brother, \"I will call you , He Who Cuts Life Out of the Enemy.\" The younger brother then said to his older brother, \"And I will call you , Monster Slayer. It is the name by which you shall always be known.\" Then the two brothers climbed back to the top of , the Blue Bead Mountain where they had landed after descending from the sky, and each sang a song in praise of their father, Jóhonaaʼéí, the Sun, as he neared the end of his journey across the sky. Then they rested for the night.\n\nThe next morning the two brothers started for home. Along the trail they met , Talking God, and , Water Sprinkler. \"Well done, nihinálí, our grandsons,\" they said. You are worthy of all that we taught you. You have served your people well.\" And the two gods each sang a song to celebrate the victory of the twins over , the Giant. These two songs are sung today whenever a victory is celebrated. When the brothers came close to the home of Changing Woman, their mother, and First Man and First Woman, they hid their armor and weapons and the scalp of in the bushes, and then went inside. Changing Woman rejoiced when she saw them. \"Where have you been?\" she asked. \"I thought a monster had devoured you.\" \"We followed , the Holy Trail,\" said the elder son, . \"We came upon , Spider Woman, and she told us how to go to the house of , our father the Sun. He gave us weapons, and with them we killed , the Big Giant.\" \"Do not say this,\" said First Man. \"No one can kill .\" Then the brothers led their mother and grandparents outside and showed them the scalp of Yéʼiitsoh, and they rejoiced. Together they sang and danced to celebrate the victory.\n\n, the elder brother, wished to fight the other monsters, it is said. He asked Changing Woman where the Horned Monster, , lived. Changing Woman said, \"He lives at , at the foot of the mountains. But you have done enough, my son, and the monsters are hard to kill.\" \"It was also hard for you to give birth to me,\" said . \"Where lives it is dangerous,\" said Changing Woman. \"To all the ends of the earth, there is no such place as Dangerous,\" answered . The brothers together made two prayer sticks of the medicine plant , each three finger widths long, and lay them in a turquoise dish. Then , Monster Slayer, said to , Who Cuts the Life Out of the Enemy, \"My brother, I will go alone to fight . You stay here and watch the holy medicine sticks. If a sunbeam should light either one, you will know that I am in danger, and you must help me. Otherwise, stay and protect the others.\"\n\nAt dawn set out to find , the Horned Monster. He came to a broad plain at the foot of the mountains, and saw lying at rest. It had hair like a moose and a great pair of horns. While , Monster Slayer stood watching, Gopher, came up to him. \"I wonder what you are doing here,\" he said. \"There is someone here I seek,\" said Monster Slayer. \"Do you not fear , the Horned Monster who feeds on your kind?\" asked Gopher. \"Now that you mention it, it is he I seek,\" said Monster Slayer. \"I wish to kill him.\" \"I can help you with that,\" said Gopher, \"but I want a piece of his hide.\" \"You shall have it,\" said . Then Gopher dug a tunnel right up to . He returned and said, \"I have tunneled right up to where he lies. And from that spot I have tunneled to the East, the South, the West, and the North. You can travel beneath him and shoot an arrow straight up into his heart.\" , Monster Slayer, could not enter the tunnel because it was too small. \"Raise your right leg,\" said Gopher. While Monster Slayer raised his leg, Gopher blew into her tunnel four times, and each time it became larger. Then , Monster Slayer entered the tunnel and crawled to where lay above the opening. He shot a chain-lightning arrow straight up into . The monster roared and tore at the earth with his horns. Monster Slayer hid in the tunnel to the east. tore at the earth around the tunnel. Before he could reach him, Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the south. Déélgééd began to tear the earth at that spot with his horns, and Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the west. dug into the earth at that spot, but Monster Slayer had run into the tunnel to the north. began to dig to the north, but he was now weak. He fell and lay down. , Monster Slayer crept back up the full length of the tunnel, to where Gopher had started it, and climbed out. There, a little old man dressed in tight leggings and a thin shirt wearing a cap with a feather approached him. This was , the Ground Squirrel. \",\" said Ground Squirrel. \"What brings you to this place?\" \"I am looking at something,\" said , Monster Slayer. \"I wonder what you are looking at,\" said Ground Squirrel. \"I am looking at ,\" said Monster Slayer. \"I wonder if I need fear him.\" \"I will go over there and see if he is dead,\" said Ground Squirrel. \"If he no longer breathes I will climb up on his horns and dance and sing. If he is dead, I want some of his blood to decorate my face.\" \"Truly, little brother,\" answered Monster Slayer, \"you shall have it.\" Ground Squirrel went to , saw that he was dead, and put some of his blood on his face and danced and sang. The face of every ground squirrel bears red streaks to this day. And so it is that there has always been good will between Earth Surface People and the ground squirrels. Gopher came and removed some of 's skin and put it on his own back. So it is that the back of gophers is thickly covered to this day, and there has been harmony between Earth Surface People and gophers to this day. And Gopher gave part of the monster's bowel and lung to Monster Slayer to take back as proof that was slain.\n\n, Monster Slayer, returned to his home and showed the lung and bowel of Déélgééd to Changing Woman and First Woman. They danced and chanted in victory. Now two of the monsters were dead. The plan of the Holy People was being fulfilled.\n\nIn a few days, had killed , Monster Eagle, and , The Monster Who Kicks People Down the Cliff, and , the Monsters That Kill with Their Eyes. \"Surely the have all been destroyed now,\" said Changing Woman. , The Wind, whispered into the ear of Monster Slayer, \"Some still survive. , the Old Age Woman, still remains. She looks like a frail creature, but she slowly saps strength with the passing years. Beware of her.\" Monster Slayer said to his mother, \"Tell me where I can find the dwelling place of , The One Who Brings Old Age.\" \"There is no need for you to seek her,\" said Changing Woman. The Wind whispered, \"She lives among the mountains at a, the Place of Mountain Sheep.\"\n\nWhen he arrived at , saw an old woman walking slowly toward him, leaning on a staff. Her back was bent. Her hair was white. Her arms and hands were bony. \"Old grandmother, I have come to kill you,\" he said. \"I do you no harm, grandson,\" she replied. \"Think it over before you kill me. Once the people discover that will no longer slowly sap their strength with the passing of years and finally devour them, they will have no children. It is better that people should pass on their wisdom and responsibilities to those who are younger, and finally die.\" \"I will spare you,\" replied . And he returned without a trophy.\n\n\", the Cold Woman, still lives,\" whispered The Wind to Monster Slayer. \"Each year she freezes the earth. She covers the streams with ice. She kills the plants so that the vines bear no melons and the stalks bear no corn.\" \"Mother,\" demanded , \"tell me where I might find the dwelling of .\" Changing Woman refused to answer. But , The Wind, whispered, \"She lives high on the summet of , where the mountain sheep are.\" Monster Slayer traveled to and found a lean old woman sitting above the tree line without clothing, on the snow. No roof sheltered her. Her skin was pale as the snow. \"Grandmother,\" said Monster Slayer, \"I am here to kill you.\" \"You may kill me,\" said Cold Woman. \"But once I am dead, it will always be hot on the earth. The land will dry up. The springs will cease to flow. Over the years the people will perish.\" Listening to her words, said, \"I will spare you.\" And he returned without a trophy.\n\n\", the Poverty Creatures, still live,\" whispered into his ear. They destroy people by gradually using up possessions. They will leave no tools for anyone to use, and no clothing to wear.\" Monster Slayer asked Changing Woman where the Poverty Creatures dwelled, but she refused to tell him. \"They live at , the Roof Butte Mountain,\" said . traveled there, and found a tattered old man and a filthy old woman. Their garments were in shreds, and in their house they had no goods. They had no food, no baskets, no bowls. \"Grandmother, Grandfather,\" said Monster Slayer, \"It gives me no pleasure, but I have come to kill you. Then people will not suffer from want.\" \"Think a moment,\" they said. \"If we were to die, people would not replace anything, or improve on their tools. By causing things to wear out, we lead people to invent new things. Garments become more beautiful. Tools become more useful. People appreciate what they have.\" Monster Slayer said, \"What you say is true. I will spare you.\" And he returned without a trophy.\n\n\", Hunger Man, still exists,\" whispered . \"He lives at , White Spot of Grass.\" When he arrived there, found twelve ravenous creatures who ate anything that grew. The largest of them was Dichin Hastiin. \"I have come here to kill you,\" said . \"Then people will not feel the pangs of hunger and they will not starve for want of food.\" \"I do not blame you for wanting me dead,\" said . \"But if you kill us, people will lose their taste for food. They will never know the pleasure of cooking and eating. But if we live, they will continue to plant seeds and harvest crops, and they will remain skilled hunters.\" After hearing these words, Monster Slayer returned without a trophy.\n\nWhen he returned home to his mother Changing Woman, he removed the sheath wherein he carried the stone knife that his father the Sun had given him. He realized that now his work was done. He sang:\n\"Now the enemy slayer arrives\"\n\"From the house of the jagged blades he arrives\"\n\"From where the sharp knives hang he arrives\"\n\"And the treasures he has won are yours, oh you gods.\"\n\nChanging Woman and and the younger twin, , who was also known as , Child of the Water, now heard a voice from the east chanting in reply: \n\"With the Slayer of Monsters I come.\" \n\"From the house of the dark stone blades I come.\" \n\"From where the dark stone knives hang I come.\" \n\"Giver of the sacred hoops I come.\" \n\"I come, I come! The dreaded one.\"\nChanging Woman said, \"It is the voice of your father. Dress yourselves quickly.\" And then she left the hogan.\n\n, the Sun, entered and greeted the twins. To he said, \"My son, have you slain all the enemies of the people?\" replied, \"Those who should die I have killed. I have been among the highest peaks, and I been through the deepest canyons. I have been to the edge of the waters, and I have been to the boundaries of the sky. And wherever I went I found no one who is not a friend to our people.\" \"Then your work is done,\" said . \"I will take the weapons I gave you back with me. Tell your mother that after four days I will return. I wish to speak with her on top of , the Giant Spruce Mountain.\" And he departed.\n\nAfter four days, , Changing Woman, went to the summit of , the Giant Spruce Mountain, and sat on a rock near the spot where she had first felt the warmth of the sun deep within her body. , the Sun, came and sat beside her. He tried to embrace her, but she stopped him. \"What do you mean by that?\" she said. \"I want you for my own,\" he replied. \"Come to the west and make a home with me there.\" \"I wish no such thing,\" she said. \"I am lonely,\" said . \"What good is all that I do if I must endure my days and nights all alone?\" After a time a silence, spoke. \"I am told you have a beautiful house in the east. I want such a house in the west. I want it built floating on the shimmering water, away from the shore, so that the Earth-Surface people will not bother me with their quarrels. I want white shell, and blue shell, and turquoise. I want haliotis. I want soapstone, agate, redstone, and jet. Because I will live there alone while you are gone each day, I want animals to keep me company. Give me buffalo, and deer, and mountain sheep, jackrabbits, prairie dogs, and muskrats. Provide me with those things and I shall go with you to the west.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by making such demands of me?\" said . \"Why should I provide you with all of those things?\" \"I will tell you why,\" she said. \"You are male and I am female. You are of the sky and I am of the earth. You are constant in your brightness, but I must change with the seasons. Remember that I willingly let you enter me and I gave birth to your sons, enduring pain to bring them into the world. As different as we are, we are of one spirit. As dissimilar as we are, you and I, we are of equal worth. As different as we are, there must be solidarity between us. There can be no harmony in the universe unless there is harmony between us. If there is to be harmony, my request must matter to you. There is to be no more coming from me to you than there is from you to me.\"\n\nAt first gave no reply. He carefully weighed all that she had said. Then slowly he placed his arm around her. She allowed him to do so. Then he promised her that all the things she wished for she would have. She would have a house in the west on the shimmering water. She would have gems, and animals. They would dwell together in harmony.\n\nWhen Changing Woman was ready to depart for her new home, the Mirage People and the Ground Mist People prepared to go with her. She said goodbye to First Man and First Woman and to her two sons. Then she and the Holy People passed through the mountains at (Red Knife), and in the Valley they celebrated her betrothal to . Her hips widened, and her breasts grew large. The elk and buffalo multiplied, and some left her herd to form other herds and spread across the land. At last she and her party and animals came to the end of the land, and then to her floating house beyond the shore. Then , Monster Slayer, and his brother , Water Born, traveled to , where the Pine River flows into the San Juan, and there they continue to live below the earth. A petroglyph was made on the canyon wall just above the water level to mark the place.\n\nThen , the Sun, said that it was time for the first four Holy People to depart from the surface of the Fourth World. These four, who had come from the First World, were First Man, , First Woman, , , Great Coyote, and the coyote , First Angry. They traveled east, beyond the house of the Sun, and took all their powers with them. As they began to travel, First Woman turned and said, \"When I wish to do so, I will send back death from disease, and the sign will be the howl of the coyote.\" Then the four Holy People who had come up from the Third World departed as well. They were , Talking God, , Water Sprinkler, , House God, and , Black God, the god of fire. As they departed, said, \"If anyone sees us it will be a sign that an enemy is coming into the country. If he hears us call, that same person will be killed by an enemy before the day is over.\" And so saying they all returned to their homes and all their powers went with them.\n\n, Changing Woman, began to live in her Floating White Bead House, beyond the shore in the west. In her home on a shelf running east to west on the south side were four water jars. The first was the Black Water Jar which contained the Black Cloud and the Male Rain. The second was the Blue Water Jar which contained the Blue Cloud and the Male Rain. The third was the Yellow Water Jar which contained the Yellow Cloud and the Male Rain. The fourth was the White Water Jar which contained the White Cloud and the Male Rain. On the north side of the home was a shelf running west to east and it were also four jars. The first was a Black Water Jar which contained the Black Vapor and the Female Rain. The second, the Blue Water Jar, contained the Blue Vapor and the Female Rain. The third, the Yellow Water Jar, contained Yellow Vapor and the Female Rain. And last, the White Water Jar, contained the White Vapor and the Female Rain. Other jars contained the seeds of plants and flowers.\n\nAs Changing Woman walks in the four directions from her house, she undergoes a change. She comes out of her house an old woman with a white bead walking stick. She walks towards the East and returns middle aged and she carries no walking stick. To the South she walks and she returns a young woman. She walks to the West and comes back a maiden. She goes North and returns a young girl. Often she and , the Sun are in harmony. At times they argue and does not return to her home at the end of his journey. At those times the sky is stormy and the whole world suffers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50228614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50228614", "title": "Feoli collection", "text": "Feoli collection\n\nThe Feoli collection (German: \"Sammlung Feoli\") is a formerly private collection of ancient art, which is now mostly part of the antiquities collection of the Martin von Wagner Museum in the south wing of the Würzburg Residenz.\n\nAgostino Feoli owned an estate which was located in the area of the necropoleis of the ancient Etruscan city of Vulci and carried out several excavations on his lands - like many other estate owners. He carried out two very successful campaigns, one from 1829 to 1831 and another from 1846 to 1847. Unlike most other such excavators, he did not sell many of his finds, but kept them for a personal collection which is still called the Feoli collection in honour of him. \n\nThe collection was initially publicised by Eduard Gerhard in his \"Rapporto Vulcente\" and was published in 1837 by in his catalogue, \"Antichi vasi dipinti della collezione Feoli\" (Ancient Painted Vases of the Feoli Collection). Feoli sold some pieces, but he traded and bought new pieces in his later years. As a result the source of the pieces in the collection which did not appear in the 1837 catalogue is not certain. After this, the collection was considered lost at times. Heinrich Brunn found it in 1865 in Rome and returned it to academic attention.\n\nFeoli's heirs had managed to gather the collection together immediately after Feoli's death, but in 1872 they had a financial crisis and had to sell the collection quickly for whatever they could get for it. The classicist Ludwig von Urlichs of the University of Wurzburg took note, using Wolfgang Helbig, who was in Rome during Easter 1872, as a mediator. With the help of the then newly invented telegraph, he transmitted the information to Bavaria and quickly convinced the , minister Johann von Lutz and the university administration to act in order to acquire the collection for the Wurzberg collection, using the income from a forthcoming exhibition of the art-collector and painter . It was more difficult to convince the university senate. It held a vote and decided that the acquisition was unnecessary, since they had already acquired a pretty substantial collection from the bequest of Wagner and some subsequent purchases. Other critics complained that there was no obvious place for storing and displaying the collection. In fact, it was originally planned that a new museum would be built with the reserves which had built up from the profits from the Wagner bequest. According to later accounts, the crucial meeting, at which the decision about the funding was to be decided, was held on a very hot and humid afternoon in the semester break. It is said that it was only thanks to a speech by Felix Dahn that the senate agreed to the speech and the money necessary to purchase the last great private collection of antiquities in Italy was made available. On 7 may 1872 the collection was bought by the university at a cost of 26,500 lire. The purchase of the collection had initially been partially funded by Urlich through the sale of securities from his wife's dowry - an act which she resented for the rest of her life. The transport of the collection to Wurzberg was overseen by Urlichs and his student . By the end of the year, Urlichs had put the collection on display and also published a catalogue of the collection. It was the last large acquisition of the Wurzburg Museum for over twenty years.\n\nWith the acquisition of the Feoli collection, the Martin Wagner Museum gained about 480 new antiquities at once, mostly dating from between 530 and 480 BC and consisting primarily of Greek vases, but also Etruscan ones. Today the Feoli collection is the heart of the Wurzberg collection of ancient pottery, which is the third largest in Germany after the Antikensammlung Berlin and the Staatliche Antikensammlungen in Munich. The Etruscan Feoli painter was given his notname for a vase in the Feoli collection by John Beazley.\n\n"}

The period roughly from 1875 to 1914 is referred to as \"the high-water mark of freethought as an influential movement in American society\". It began around 1856 and lasted at least through the end of the century; author Susan Jacoby places the end of the Golden Age at the start of World War I.\n\nFreethought is a philosophical position that holds that ideas and opinions should be based on science and reason, and not restricted by authority, tradition, or religion. The Golden Age was encouraged by the lectures of the extremely popular agnostic orator Robert G. Ingersoll, the popularization of Charles Darwin’s \"Origin of Species\", the push for women’s suffrage, and other political, scientific, and social trends that clashed with religious orthodoxy and caused people to question their traditional ideas about the world.\n\nWith this movement came a devoted group of “freethinkers”. A Freethinker is someone who does not believe in the driving force of religion or the strict word of the bible. They may be considered agnostic and do not believe in specific religious hierarchy. A freethinker of the late 19th century could have been someone from any of the varied religious and political backgrounds.\n\nCharles Knowlton, D. M. Bennett, and Robert G. Ingersoll were influential freethinkers in the Golden Age of Freethought in the mid-late 19th century.\n\nRobert Green Ingersoll (1833–1899) was one of the more prominent freethinkers of his time. He was known as the “Great Agnostic”. An agnostic person would be one who neither believes nor disbelieves in a religious deity. Ingersoll, a lawyer, an orator and a Civil War veteran, is famous for his skeptical approaches to popular religious beliefs. He would speak in public about orthodox views and would often poke fun. Guests would pay $1 to hear him speak. A dollar in his day was a hefty sum. Ingersoll was the leader of the American Secular Union, successor organization to the National Liberal League.\n\nCharles Knowlton was born into a Puritan household in the year 1800. The science and medicine practiced around this time was known as “heroic”. Heroic Medicinal treatment was rather medieval and consisted of blood-letting, vomiting and profuse sweating. These “treatments” actually proved harmful to the patients. Knowlton had wet dreams in his adolescence, leading him to be the subject of all types of heroic treatments. He fantasized about proper humane treatment. He believed that in order for treatment to be effective and healthy, one must be proficient in the understanding of human anatomy. He began robbing graves and studying the patients within them. This would later get him wound up in jail. He was released and determined as ever to finish his quest. He later became a doctor, putting his scientific findings into his practice. He would later marry into a family of freethinkers. He wrote “Elements of Modern Materialism” and “Fruits of Philosophy” in 1832. The second would prove much more successful. The book included a spermicidal method which he invented.\n\nAuthor Susan Jacoby backs up these claims in her published work “Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism” and “The Age of American Unreason”.\n\nThese writers and scholars left the American people with a wide, earthly view on spiritual and political matters. With such a bright, independent community, the American Government began to feel threatened. The Russian Revolution and the scare of Communism in the early 20th century would soon come about, and with that the force of religious and government backed opposition. Some members of the Freethought Movement were atheists, giving Christians plenty of leverage to convince the people that they were un-American. This put the Golden Age of Freethought to rest.\n\n"}

Lawton, Hattie Lewis, and Hattie Lewis Lawton was an American detective, who worked for Allan Pinkerton, of the Pinkerton Detective Agency. Lawton may have been born around 1837, although, most details of her life, before and after the American Civil War, are unknown. \"[Hattie] Lawton was part of Pinkerton's Female Detective Bureau, formed in 1860 to 'worm out secrets' by means unavailable to male detectives.\"\nHattie Lawton, along with fellow female Pinkerton detective Kate Warne, worked with other Pinkerton agents who actively participated in the detection of the alleged 1861 Baltimore assassination plot against President-elect Abraham Lincoln.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Hattie Lawton continued to work with the Pinkerton Detective Agency. According to Pinkerton's account, in the early part of 1861, Lawton was stationed in Perryville, Maryland, with Timothy Webster, another Pinkerton agent.\n\nAfter Pinkerton began his \"Secret Service\" for Gen. George B. McClellan, Lawton and Webster were added to the payroll of the Pinkerton's service in Washington on August 8, 1861. Lawton again posing as Timothy Webster's wife appeared in Richmond, Virginia in the early part of 1862. The two were sent by Pinkerton to Richmond to gather intelligence about Confederate army movements.\n\nHattie Lawton tended to Timothy Webster when he fell ill at the Monument Hotel in Richmond, which prevented intelligence reports from being sent back to Allan Pinkerton. John Scobell, an African American Union spy, worked with the \"twenty-five-year-old beauty\", Hattie Lawton, during this time, posing as her servant.\n\nAllan Pinkerton sent two agents, Pryce Lewis and John Scully, to Richmond, Virginia, to find out what happened to Webster and Lawton. They found Webster and Lawton, but Lewis and Scully were recognized as Pinkerton agents, arrested and later released as part of a prisoner exchange on March 18, 1863. Various sources indicate that one or both of the men, either to save their own lives or after being tricked, revealed the identity of Webster. Webster and Lawton were arrested and after a quick trial both were found guilty. \n\nTimothy Webster was sentenced to death and executed, on April 29, 1862. Lawton was sentenced to one year in Castle Thunder prison in Richmond, Virginia. In Confederate records, Lawton was described as \"Mrs. Timothy Webster\", one of a party of four Federals, exchanged for Confederate spy Belle Boyd, on December 13, 1862.\n\nDuring her imprisonment, Richmond's most accomplished Union spy, Elizabeth Van Lew, visited Hattie Lawton, but it is unclear whether Van Lew was aware of the real identity of \"Mrs. Timothy Webster\".\n\nAfter, her release from prison, nothing is known about what happened to Hattie Lawton or when she died.\n\n\n\n"}

It was on the eastern coast of Iberia down to the town of Cartago Nova, today's Cartagena, Spain in the autonomous community of Murcia, Spain. It roughly covered today's Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia and Valencia. Further south there was the Roman Province of Hispania Ulterior (\"Further Iberia\"), being further away from Rome. The two provinces were formed in 197 BC, four years after the end of the Second Punic War (218-201 BC). During this war Scipio Africanus defeated the Carthaginians at the Battle of Ilipa (near Seville) in 206 BC. This led to the Romans taking over the Carthaginian possessions in southern Spain and on the east coast up to the River Ebro. Several governors of Hispania Citerior commanded wars against the Celtiberians who lived to the west of this province. In the late first century BC Augustus reorganised the Roman provinces in Hispania and Hispania Citerior was replaced by the larger province of Hispania Tarraconensis, which included the territories the Romans had conquered in central, northern and north-western Hispania. Augustus also renamed Hispania Ulterior Hispania Baetica and created a third province, Hispania Lusitania.\n\nHispania is the Latin term given to the Iberian peninsula. The term can be traced back to at least 200 BC by the poet Quintus Ennius. The word is possibly derived from the Punic אי שפן \"I-Shaphan\" meaning \"coast of hyraxes\", in turn a misidentification on the part of Phoenician explorers of its numerous rabbits as hyraxes. According to ancient historian Cassius Dio, the people of the region came from many different tribes, not sharing a common language nor a common government.\n\n\n"}

He is regarded as one of the most influential archaeologists in North America in the 20th century.\n\nBorn in Atchison, Kansas, the son of Charles and Maude Griffin, Jimmy and his family subsequently moved to Denver, Colorado. His father was a supplier for railroad equipment. Griffin's interest in archaeology was born through reading as a child and his love for visiting museums. When Jimmy was eleven his family moved to Oak Park, Illinois, where he lived until he enrolled in college. He attended Oak Park schools and was a cheerleader at Oak Park and River Forest High School. At school in Oak Park he met Fred Eggan and Wendell Bennett. His friendship with these two schoolmates would last into graduate school and his professional career in anthropology. In 1933, he married Ruby Fletcher. They had three children: John, David, and James. Griffin retired in 1976 and remained in Ann Arbor for several years. His wife died in 1979, and in 1984, he moved to Washington D.C. He met Mary Dewitt there and soon married her. They spent twelve years together living in Washington before Griffin’s death in Bethesda, Maryland aged 92.\n\nGriffin attended and graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School where he became a champion swimmer, as well as cheer leader. He then enrolled into the University of Chicago in 1923 where he initially planned on studying Business Administration. After two years in the BA program, he transferred to the program of General Science. He graduated with his bachelor's degree in 1927. After graduating, Griffin took a brief break from school to work for Amoco, but later returned to the University of Chicago. In 1930, he graduated with a Master of Arts Degree in Sociology and Anthropology. In 1936 he was awarded a special Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Michigan, as the department there did not yet have a formal Ph.D. program.\n\nGriffin accepted a research fellowship in 1933 at the University of Michigan. That same year, he moved to Ann Arbor, where he would live for the next five decades. His first fieldwork was conducted in the summer of 1929, where he excavated at the Parker Heights Mound near Quincy, Illinois, a project led by William Krogman. By 1931, Griffin had gained enough experience in the field to conduct his own excavations. He led an excavation of Upper Susquehanna Valley, Pennsylvania, for the Tioga Point Museum. The following season, the project had to be postponed due to budget cuts caused by the depression. Griffin spent the season writing a manuscript about the summer spent excavating the Parker Heights Mound a few years earlier. However, this manuscript was not published until 1991 by the Center for American Archeology in Kampsville, Illinois.\nIn the fall of 1939, Griffin accompanied James A. Ford and Philip Phillips on the start of a Lower Mississippi survey project. In 1945, he was appointed Associate Professor of Archaeology at Michigan. Four years later, he became a full professor. Between 1940 and 1946, Griffin spent nearly three field seasons working on surface surveys, while his partner Phillips worked on stratigraphic excavations at sites in the southeast, work published in 1951 in a monograph that has come to be regarded as a classic in American Archaeology, Archeological Survey In the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley, 1940-1947 (Phillips, Ford and Griffin 1951) After this project, Griffin began work with A. C. Spaulding on the Central Mississippi Survey in 1950. Fieldwork was done in southeast Missouri and at the Roots site near the Kaskaskia River, but the main project was at Cahokia. These projects continued for a few more years, but Griffin stepped down as the leader of them in the mid-1950s. Griffin also conducted work in Europe, Mexico, and the former Soviet Union.\n\nGriffin’s primary involvement in field activities shifted to a broader synthetic study and overview of archaeology itself. However, he still was involved with fieldwork. Between the years of 1963 and 1964, Griffin supervised an excavation at the Norton Mound group, a Hopewell Tradition-related site in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Soon after this, one of Griffins students, James E. Price, encouraged him to return to the northern end of the Lower Mississippi Valley with the Powers Phase project in southeast Missouri (1968–1972). The involvement with this site helped graduate students gain experience in new collecting and field techniques.\n\nThough Griffin is known as a superb field and technical research archaeologist, he was also a distinguished professor whose teaching abilities inspired many of his students throughout the years to become archaeologists as well. He helped train dozens of North American archaeologists, many of whom went on to prominence themselves. His legacy as a professor was that in the 1970s and 1980s, many of the major archaeological graduate programs in North America were staffed by Griffin’s students. Even now, most archaeologists who focus on Eastern Woodlands prehistory are linked to Griffin or one or more of his students in some way. Those who knew him personally said he had an extraordinary ability to teach, and that his students worked hard to gain his respect. In addition to his teaching at Michigan, he served as a visiting professor at many schools, including the University of California, Berkeley in 1960, the University of Colorado in 1962, and Louisiana State University in 1971.\n\nThroughout his career, Griffin was a regular participant at conferences and meetings of numerous professional organizations. His record of attendance was extraordinary at both the Society for American Archaeology meetings (which he helped found in 1934) and the Southeastern Archaeological Conference (which he founded with James A. Ford in 1937). He highly sought after by symposium organizers as a presenter or discussant. Griffin was well known for his extraordinary memory of the tens of thousands of artifacts he had seen in collections from all over Eastern North America—making connections between an artifact in one collection to another artifact he may have examined many years earlier at another institution. His ability to make these connections across space and time often yielded dramatic insights from a single photographic slide or presented paper. He was also known for his a sharp wit and his devastatingly sarcastic and thoroughly non-PC sense of humor, which he used to great effect. He could be a merciless critic of what he considered poorly done archaeology or sloppy scholarship, both verbally and in print. Most notably, he was embroiled in a long and antagonistic intellectual relationship with the next reigning lion in American archaeology, Lewis R. Binford.\n\nGriffin retired from Michigan in 1976, but eight years later, he moved to Washington D.C. to become associated with the Department of Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution until he died in 1997.\n\nGriffin received the Viking Fund Award and Medal in Archaeology in 1957 from the Wenner Grenn Foundation. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1968. He received the University of Michigan's Faculty Achievement Award in 1971; the same year he received an Honorary Doctorate from Indiana University. The University of Michigan honored him with the Henry Russell Lectureship for Outstanding Research in 1972. The Society for American Archaeology awarded Griffin the Fryxell Award for excellence in interdisciplinary research in 1980 and the Distinguished Service Award in 1984.\n\nHe served as the director of the Museum of Anthropology of Michigan from 1946-1975. He organized and managed the Ceramic Repository for the Eastern United States, a central source of information and collections about prehistoric pottery based out of the University of Michigan. He and H.R. Crane founded the University’s Radiocarbon Laboratory that was in operation from 1949-1970. He served many years in the Council of the International Union of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences. He was considered the premier Eastern North American ceramics expert by many of his colleagues. He wrote more than 260 articles and eight books about ceramics and applying other sciences to archaeology. Altogether, Griffin was among the most honored archaeologists of his generation.\n\n\n\n"}

Laupheim was first mentioned in 778 and gained city rights in 1869. One of the main trading routes, from Ulm to Ravensburg and then on towards Lake Constance ran through Laupheim. Having developed from a rural settlement into a small urban area, Laupheim is home to a number of small to medium-sized industries and businesses. One of the largest employers are the German Armed Forces which maintain an airbase close to Laupheim, Laupheim Air Base.\n\nLaupheim was the administrative centre of the district of Laupheim from 1842 until 1938 when the district was abolished. The southern parts of it were incorporated into the district of Biberach (including Laupheim itself) whereas the remainders were allocated to the district of Ulm.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century Laupheim was home to the largest Jewish community in the Kingdom of Württemberg.\n\nLaupheim is the educational centre for the surrounding rural areas particularly with regards to secondary education.\n\nLaupheim is situated in the region of Upper Swabia approximately 20 km north of Biberach and 20 km south of Ulm on the Bundesstraße 30. Laupheim is the second largest city in the district of Biberach. The original settlement of Laupheim was located close to the Rottum which still runs through the city but since 1950 the city has expanded and sprawls onto the surrounding slopes.\n\nWith effect of 1 Januar 2016 Laupheim has been awarded the status of major district town.\n\nThe elevation within the city confines ranges from 509 m (1670 ft) above sea level at the bottom of the valley to 539 m (1768 ft) in the outlying suburban areas.\n\nApart from the city of Laupheim itself, the following once autonomous villages nowadays belong administratively to Laupheim: Baustetten (population 2121), Obersulmetingen (population 1389), Untersulmetingen (population 2082) and Bihlafingen (population 853) which, with an elevation of 580 m (1903 ft), has the highest elevation of the administrative area.\n\nThe area in and around Laupheim has been settled from very early times onwards. Archaeological evidence shows that 15000 years ago nomadic tribes roamed the countryside. From ca. 2000 BCE onwards, Celts inhabited this area. From the first century CE until around the year 260 CE, it was part of the Roman province of Raetia, after which the Alamanni invaded the \"Agri Decumates\", eventually also settling in the area that was to become Laupheim. During archaeological excavations in 1840-1842 graves dating from the Merovingian period were discovered in the northern part of the town. \n\nLaupheim was first mentioned as \"Louphaim\" in a charter dated 778. The charter is still kept in the archives of the monastery of St Gallen, Switzerland. This reference is the earliest of any city in Upper Swabia and any parish in the district of Biberach.\n\nSituated in the vicinity of two major trade routes between the Lake of Constance and Ulm and the Swabian Alb and the valley of the river Iller respectively, Laupheim developed into a major settlement. In 853, it was elevated to the status of town when a court responsible for the \"Rammachgau\" (also spelled \"Rammagau\") was set up there.\n\nDuring the 9th century, parts of Laupheim came into the possession of the monastery of Weißenburg which was afterwards passed on to successive minor Swabian aristocratic houses.\n\nAs early as the 10th century, Laupheim possessed a parish church with subsidiaries. In 926, Laupheim and its surroundings were destroyed by the Hungarians. A castle is mentioned around the year 1100.\n\nLaupheim appears to have been home of an indigenous noble family, whose members used the suffix \"von Laupheim.\" They were attested for the first time in 1110 with Landoldus de Lobhein and seemed to have been in service of the counts of Kirchberg. The last known member of this family was Berchtolt von Laupheim who was a citizen of Ulm 1372, long after his family has lost possession of any rights in Laupheim around 1310.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Empire of the Staufers during the 13th century, the castle and parish of Laupheim came into the possession of the Truchsessen von Waldburg who, in 1331, sold Laupheim together with their other possessions in Upper Swabia to the Austrian House of Habsburg.\n\nThe Habsburgs mortgaged Laupheim in 1334 to the barons von Ellerbach and enfeoffed this baronial family in 1407 with castle, town and patronage of the church.\n\nThe village was badly affected by the crisis of the mid 14th century, caused by the Black Death and other factors. The population shrunk and as a consequence the hamlet of Ringelhausen, situated between Laupheim and Bronnen, was abandoned and eventually lost in the 15th century. Only the name of a street and a development area in the city of Laupheim nowadays hints at the existence of this hamlet.\n\nThe Herren von Ellerbach had St Leonhard's Chapel built in 1448, which soon became a place of pilgrimage.\n\nIn 1430, Emperor Sigismund bestowed upon Burkhard von Ellerbach the right to hold regular markets, Laupheim thereby becoming a market town, and also the privilege of inflicting high justice, which gave him the right to hold a criminal court inflicting bodily punishment, including the death penalty. The local ruler was now master of life and death. Due to the weekly market and the annual Gallus-market, Laupheim quickly developed into a commercial centre.\n\nDuring the course of the German Peasants' War 1525, Laupheim Castle was destroyed by the Baltringer Haufen, an army of peasants named after the nearby village of Baltringen, where approximately 12.000 farmers gathered to form an army. After the suppression of the revolt, the peasants were forced to rebuild the castle.\n\nAfter the agnatic line of the Ellerbach dynasty became extinct in 1570, Laupheim passed through Hans Pankraz von Freyberg to the Herren von Welden in 1582. They turned Laupheim into their permanent residence and established the first school in 1584. From 1582 until 1806, Laupheim was a Lordship (\"Reichsritterschaft\") ruled by the heir of the Welden family, whose title was \"Imperial Knight\" (\"Reichsritter\").\nIn 1596, the right to bear a coat of arms was given to Laupheim, showing the colours of green, white and red together with three leaves on a three hills, thereby incorporating the coat-of-arms of the family of Welden with the three leaves, referring to the name of the town on the hills of the valley of the river Rottum.\n\nThe last member of the House of Ellerbach, Anna von Freyberg, founded the Hospital of the Holy Spirit in 1601, the building of which still exists and now functions as a retirement home.\n\nBetween 1623 and 1661, the church St. Peter and Paul was built in the vicinity of the castle.\n\nDue to the inheritance laws of the house of Welden, the market town was divided into two different territories, \"Großlaupheim\" and \"Kleinlaupheim\" (\"Great Laupheim\" and \"Little Laupheim\"), in 1621, at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), each territory being ruled by its own dynasty. As a consequence economic growth slowed down.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, Laupheim repeatedly fell victim to the ravages of war, mainly due to marauding troops, both imperial, that is Catholic, and Swedish, their Protestant opponents. A massive outbreak of the bubonic plague in 1635 further diminished the population. At the close of the Thirty Years' War, Laupheim had lost two-thirds of its pre-war population, so that ultimately towards the end of the 17th century, Laupheim had sunk to the status of an unimportant, impoverished village. As a consequence of the Thirty Years' War, the feudal lords attempted to increase taxation and extend the amount of socage the peasants had to do for them. This led to legal conflicts between the two parties, which lasted for decades.\nIn order to stimulate the local economy and income generated by taxation, Carl Damian von Welden allowed the first Jewish families to settle in Großlaupheim in the 1720s. This which was made possible by a contract, protecting the Jews. The Jews were made to settle in an area of the town soon to be called \"Judenberg\" (literally \"Jews' mountain\" or \"Jews' hill\"). Subsequently, a Jewish quarter evolved, with a cemetery, synagogue, school and a Rabbi's office.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the Welden dynasty had the old castle, \"Großlaupheim Castle\", restored, and subsequently renewed in Baroque-style in 1752. Between 1766 and 1769, the branch of the Welden dynasty that ruled Kleinlaupheim had their residence renewed in Baroque-style by architect Johann Georg Specht. This castle is now called \"Schloss Kleinlaupheim\" (Kleinlaupheim Castle). This makes Laupheim unique in that it has two castles within its city boundaries, as a result of once having been two independent states.\nIn 1778, a town hall and the granary were built in the Upper Market Square.\n\nFollowing the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, the mediatisation and secularisation of numerous secular and ecclesiastical principalities within the former Holy Roman Empire, both parts of Laupheim were annexed by the newly formed Kingdom of Württemberg in 1806. The last ruler of Laupheim was Constantin von Welden. Laupheim first became administratively part of the district of Wiblingen, but in 1845 the district administration was moved to Laupheim, creating the district of Laupheim. The district as abolished in 1938 when Laupheim became part of the district of Biberach.\n\nDue to laws based on the ideas of the enlightenment, servitude in the Kingdom of Württemberg was abolished in 1836. During the same period, laws forcing Jews to live in separate quarters and excluding them from most business activities were revoked. This enabled them to contribute enormously to the economic upturn Laupheim was experiencing, even though complete civil rights were not granted until 1864.\n\nIn 1848, with the arrival of civil servants from the original Duchy of Württemberg (\"Altwürttemberg\"), a Protestant parish was founded.\n\nIn 1850, a train station opened two kilometers west of Laupheim, on the railway line Ulm-Friedrichshafen from Ulm to Friedrichshafen, this station therefore being named as Laupheim-West.\n\nIn 1869, Laupheim was granted a city charter by King Karl I. of Württemberg. In the same year, the first institute of further education, a \"Lateinschule,\" was established in Laupheim. In 1871, Laupheim, being part of the Kingdom of Württemberg, was incorporated into the German Empire.\nDuring the steep economic growth of the Gründerzeit, the period between 1871 and 1914, Laupheim had the highest density of public houses in the whole Kingdom of Württemberg.\n\nIn 1904, the city was connected to the railway line Ulm-Friedrichshafen by a branch line, linking the railway artery with the city itself. At the same time a train station was built in the city. This extension of the railway line went on for a further 16 km, terminating at the village of Schwendi.\nBefore World War I, Laupheim had one of the largest Jewish communities in Württemberg. However, the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and the systematic deprivation and subsequent suppression of Jews in Germany, also had their effects on Laupheim, culminating in the destruction by fire of the synagogue during the so-called Kristallnacht 1938.\n\nDue to the programme of aryanization, many businesses in Laupheim originally owned by Jews, were expropriated and transferred into German ownership.\n\n126 of 312 Jewish inhabitants of Laupheim managed to flee abroad, most of them after the so-called \"Kristallnacht\". In 1939, the remaining Jews in Laupheim were resettled within the city, only to be deported to concentration and extermination camps in 1941 and 1942. After the last of four transports, the Jewish community in Laupheim ceased to exist on 19 August 1942.\n\nSixty-two Jewish citizens of Laupheim perished in the Shoah, only two survived.\n\nAfter World War II, in the 1960s, Laupheim began to renew and modernize its appearance. New schools were built: a grammar school, a realschule and a new town hall. From the 1980s onwards, these projects were followed by a new district hospital, a public in-doors swimming pool, a renovated stadium, named after Gretel Bergmann who was born in Laupheim, and an omnibus interchange.\n\nAdditionally, several industrial estates on the outskirts of the city were established in order to attract trade and industry. As a consequence, companies from outside Laupheim established offices and production facilities there, as well as companies that formerly had been operating from the city centre.\n\nHaving developed from a rural market town into a city, predominated by industry, trade and the service industries, the demographics of Laupheim have changed as well.\n\nAfter growing continuously from 1871 until 1933, from the Gründerzeit until the Nazis came to power, this development came to a halt. The stagnation and eventual decrease in population was due to increasing persecution of the Jews, as a result of which many Jewish inhabitants left Laupheim or, after 1940, were deported and subsequently murdered.\n\nSince 1945, the population of Laupheim has almost doubled. This is due to the fact that a great number of refugees from formerly German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line were settled in Laupheim.\n\nThe establishment of a German Army Aviation Corps airbase in 1964 further contributed to the growth in population.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, an influx of ethnic Germans from the Commonwealth of Independent States added to the population growth.\n\nAs of 31 December 2016, the number of non-German inhabitants of Laupheim totals 2768 (12.73% of the total population).\n\nThe city council consists of 28 members.\n\nDuring the local elections on 25 May 2014, all seats on the city council were contested. The elections gave the following result:\n\nThe next local elections are due to be held in 2019.\n\nLaupheim is part of the constituency of Biberach for elections to the Landtag of Baden-Württemberg as well as the Bundestag.\n\nHere is a list of politicians from Laupheim:\n\nLaupheim is formally twinned with:\n\n\nThe following companies, some of them operating internationally, are based in Laupheim:\n\nThe following educational establishments exist in Laupheim and its subordinate villages: \n\nLaupheim had a magistrates' court which was a branch of the district court of Biberach. The Laupheim branch was closed on 1 April 2004. The town hall houses the offices of the district notary.\n\n\nLaupheim was home to Medium Transport Helicopter Regiment 25 \"Oberschwaben\" (Upper Swabia) and Support Squadron 10 of the German Army Aviation Corps (\"Heeresflieger\"). The German Army Aviation Corps base was established in 1964 utilizing already existing facilities. Medium Transport Regiment 25 was disbanded on 31 December 2012 when personnel and material were transferred to the German Air Force and re-established as Helicopter Wing 64 on 1 January 2013. Helicopter Wing 64 is equipped with transport helicopter CH-53 and light utility helicopter H145M LUH SOF. German Army Aviation Corps Support Squadron 10 was equipped with helicopters of the type Bo-105. The unit disbanded in 2007.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 1990s the regiment had only seen service in other NATO countries, mainly while on manoeuvre or on aid-missions after natural disasters. Since then, however, it has been deployed abroad on various aid-missions and so far has seen service on NATO and United Nations peacekeeping missions, first in Iraq after the 1st Gulf War, then on the Balkans with IFOR, KFOR, SFOR and EUFOR, in Afghanistan as part of ISAF, which is ongoing, and most recently in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of EUFOR RD Congo to support the UN mission MONUC to monitor the general elections in 2006. This mission began in June 2006 and ended with the last soldiers returning in December of the same year.\n\nWith a workforce of about 1,350, both military and civilian, the base is the largest, single employer in Laupheim.\n\nGroßlaupheim Castle is situated on a hill on the verge of the city close to the local parish church.\nThe existence of a castle in Laupheim was documented for the first time around the year 1100. There is no evidence that the castle originally consisted of more than a wooden structure. This castle existed until the Peasants' War in 1525, when it was destroyed by rebellious peasants. After the end of hostilities, the peasants were forced to rebuild the castle in stone. The structure as it stands today was erected in three different phases:\n\n\nThe Museum of the History of Christians and Jews is situated in Großlaupheim Castle. It is unique in Germany in that its collection concentrates on the documentation of the relationship between Christians and Jews on a local level, using Laupheim, which once had the largest Jewish community in the Kingdom of Württemberg, as an example. The exhibition documents in chronological order all aspects of more than 200 years of Jewish life in Laupheim.\n\nThe park is situated at the bottom of the hill on top of which \"Schloss Großlaupheim\" lies. The castle park was designed in the English Style by Kilian von Steiner. A huge number of trees, meadows and lakes created an impressive appearance. Originally, it was well known for its exotic trees and plants. Formerly, there were five lakes, which, during winter, provided a brewery with ice. During summer, the lakes were used for raising trout. However, in recent times the maintenance of the ground and the lakes was neglected due to a lack of council funding. In recent years efforts have been made to restore the park, at least in parts, to its former glory. In 2011, the park was declared a \"Garden Monument' by the state of Baden-Württemberg's National Trust.\n\nKleinlaupheim Castle is situated on a hill south-west of the river Rottum within the city limits of Laupheim.\nIn its present state it was built between 1766 and 1769 as a place of residence for the ruler of Kleinlaupheim at the time, the Freiherr Joseph Ignaz von Welden-Kleinlaupheim (1721–1802). It was designed by Johann Georg Specht of Lindenberg in Baroque-style. It consists of a three-storey building with a curved mansard roof. Pilasters, cornices and gables enliven the facade of the building. Inside there is a remarkable grand staircase in the vestibule.\n\nIt now houses the local police station and an art gallery, \"Die Wache Galerie\", a pun on words in that \"Wache\" can mean police station as well as alert or awake.\n\nThe Parish Church St Peter and Paul, built between 1623 and 1661, lies in close proximity to Großlaupheim Castle. It was designed by Martino I. Barbieri from Roveredo in Baroque-style, showing influences of manierism. The interior of the church is decorated with sculptures by Dominikus Hermenegild Herberger and paintings by Johann Georg Bergmüller.\n\nThe planetarium and public astronomical observatory of Laupheim () counts about 40000 visitors each year. It is run on a mostly voluntary basis by the club \"Volkssternwarte Laupheim e.V.\" (founded 1975), providing high quality astronomical education. The work of the club has been recognized by astronomer Carolyn Shoemaker, who named the asteroid 7167 Laupheim in honour of the institution.\n\nThe annual historical festival, the \"Kinder- und Heimatfest\", takes place during the last weekend of June. It consists of processions and parades, performed by various groups, incorporating performances in historical costumes, concert bands and floats, referring to contemporary and historical events. There is also a funfair, accompanied by several pole marquees, as well as much revelling in the bars, cafes and pubs of the city.\n\nOn the last Sunday of the summer holidays, the traditional \"Brunnenfest\" (fountain party) takes place in the city centre. A huge street party, it is concentrated on the Upper and Lower Market Square. The name of the event derives from the Neptune-fountain, situated in the Upper Market Square. A great number of stalls serves Swabian and international cuisine as well as a large variety of beverages. The stalls are organised and manned by local clubs. Concert bands, Jazz bands and Volksmusik bands entertain visitors. On a stage dance and sport performances are shown. Additionally, a flea market is held at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "177102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177102", "title": "Marx's theory of alienation", "text": "Marx's theory of alienation\n\nKarl Marx's theory of alienation describes the estrangement (\"Entfremdung\") of people from aspects of their \"Gattungswesen\" (\"species-essence\") as a consequence of living in a society of stratified social classes. The alienation from the self is a consequence of being a mechanistic part of a social class, the condition of which estranges a person from their humanity.\n\nThe theoretic basis of alienation within the capitalist mode of production is that the worker invariably loses the ability to determine life and destiny when deprived of the right to think (conceive) of themselves as the director of their own actions; to determine the character of said actions; to define relationships with other people; and to own those items of value from goods and services, produced by their own labour. Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realized human being, as an economic entity this worker is directed to goals and diverted to activities that are dictated by the bourgeoisie—who own the means of production—in order to extract from the worker the maximum amount of surplus value in the course of business competition among industrialists.\n\nIn the \"Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844\" (1932), Karl Marx expressed the \"Entfremdung\" theory—of estrangement from the self. Philosophically, the theory of \"Entfremdung\" relies upon \"The Essence of Christianity\" (1841) by Ludwig Feuerbach which states that the idea of a supernatural god has alienated the natural characteristics of the human being. Moreover, Max Stirner extended Feuerbach's analysis in \"The Ego and its Own\" (1845) that even the idea of \"humanity\" is an alienating concept for individuals to intellectually consider in its full philosophic implication. Marx and Friedrich Engels responded to these philosophic propositions in \"The German Ideology\" (1845).\n\nIn a capitalist society, the worker's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can only express labour—a fundamental social aspect of personal individuality—through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument, a thing and not a person. In the \"Comment on James Mill\" (1844), Marx explained alienation thus: Let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings. Each of us would have, in two ways, affirmed himself, and the other person. (i) In my production I would have objectified my individuality, its specific character, and, therefore, enjoyed not only an individual manifestation of my life during the activity, but also, when looking at the object, I would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to be objective, visible to the senses, and, hence, a power beyond all doubt. (ii) In your enjoyment, or use, of my product I would have the direct enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work, that is, of having objectified man's essential nature, and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another man's essential nature [...] Our products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our essential nature.\n\nIn the \"Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844\" (1932), Marx identified four types of alienation that occur to the worker labouring under a capitalist system of industrial production.\n\nThe design of the product and how it is produced are determined, not by the producers who make it (the workers), nor by the consumers of the product (the buyers), but by the capitalist class who besides accommodating the worker's manual labour also accommodate the intellectual labour of the engineer and the industrial designer who create the product in order to shape the taste of the consumer to buy the goods and services at a price that yields a maximal profit. Aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol, alienation (\"Entfremdung\") broadly describes the conversion of labour (work as an activity), which is performed to generate a use value (the product), into a commodity, which—like products—can be assigned an exchange value. That is, the capitalist gains control of the manual and intellectual workers and the benefits of their labour, with a system of industrial production that converts said labour into concrete products (goods and services) that benefit the consumer. Moreover, the capitalist production system also reifies labour into the \"concrete\" concept of \"work\" (a job), for which the worker is paid wages—at the lowest-possible rate—that maintain a maximum rate of return on the capitalist's investment capital; this is an aspect of exploitation. Furthermore, with such a reified system of industrial production, the profit (exchange value) generated by the sale of the goods and services (products) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes: the functional capitalist, who manages the means of production; and the rentier capitalist, who owns the means of production.\n\nIn the capitalist mode of production, the generation of products (goods and services) is accomplished with an endless sequence of discrete, repetitive motions that offer the worker little psychological satisfaction for \"a job well done\". By means of commodification, the labor power of the worker is reduced to wages (an exchange value); the psychological estrangement (\"Entfremdung\") of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labor and the wages paid to him for the labor. The worker is alienated from the means of production via two forms; wage compulsion and the imposed production content. The worker is bound to unwanted labour as a means of survival, labour is not \"voluntary but coerced\" (forced labor). The worker is only able to reject wage compulsion at the expense of their life and that of their family. The distribution of private property in the hands of wealth owners, combined with government enforced taxes compel workers to labor. In a capitalist world, our means of survival is based on monetary exchange, therefore we have no other choice than to sell our labour power and consequently be bound to the demands of the capitalist. The worker \"[d]oes not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself\"; \"[l]abor is external to the worker\" (p. 74), it is not a part of their essential being. During work, the worker is miserable, unhappy and drained of their energy, work \"mortifies his body and ruins his mind\". The production content, direction and form are imposed by the capitalist. The worker is being controlled and told what to do since they do not own the means of production they have no say in production, \"labor is external to the worker, i.e. it does not belong to his essential being (p. 74). A person's mind should be free and conscious, instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist, \"the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else's, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another\" (p. 74). This means he cannot freely and spontaneously create according to his own directive as labor's form and direction belong to someone else.\n\nThe \"Gattungswesen\" (species-essence), human nature of individuals is not discrete (separate and apart) from their activity as a worker and as such species-essence also comprises all of innate human potential as a person. Conceptually, in the term \"species-essence\" the word \"species\" describes the intrinsic human mental essence that is characterized by a \"plurality of interests\" and \"psychological dynamism\", whereby every individual has the desire and the tendency to engage in the many activities that promote mutual human survival and psychological well-being, by means of emotional connections with other people, with society. The psychic value of a human consists in being able to conceive (think) of the ends of their actions as purposeful ideas, which are distinct from the actions required to realize a given idea. That is, humans are able to objectify their intentions by means of an idea of themselves as \"the subject\" and an idea of the thing that they produce, \"the object\". Conversely, unlike a human being an animal does not objectify itself as \"the subject\" nor its products as ideas, \"the object\", because an animal engages in directly self-sustaining actions that have neither a future intention, nor a conscious intention. Whereas a person's \"Gattungswesen\" (human nature) does not exist independently of specific, historically conditioned activities, the essential nature of a human being is actualized when an individual—within their given historical circumstance—is free to subordinate their will to the internal demands they have imposed upon themselves by their imagination and not the external demands imposed upon individuals by other people.\n\nWhatever the character of a person's consciousness (will and imagination), societal existence is conditioned by their relationships with the people and things that facilitate survival, which is fundamentally dependent upon co-operation with others, thus, a person's consciousness is determined inter-subjectively (collectively), not subjectively (individually), because humans are a social animal. In the course of history, to ensure individual survival societies have organized themselves into groups who have different, basic relationships to the means of production. One societal group (class) owned and controlled the means of production while another societal class worked the means of production and in the relations of production of that \"status quo\" the goal of the owner-class was to economically benefit as much as possible from the labour of the working class. In the course of economic development when a new type of economy displaced an old type of economy—agrarian feudalism superseded by mercantilism, in turn superseded by the Industrial Revolution—the rearranged economic order of the social classes favored the social class who controlled the technologies (the means of production) that made possible the change in the relations of production. Likewise, there occurred a corresponding rearrangement of the human nature (\"Gattungswesen\") and the system of values of the owner-class and of the working-class, which allowed each group of people to accept and to function in the rearranged \"status quo\" of production-relations.\n\nDespite the ideological promise of industrialization—that the mechanization of industrial production would raise the mass of the workers from a brutish life of subsistence existence to honorable work—the division of labour inherent to the capitalist mode of production thwarted the human nature (\"Gattungswesen\") of the worker and so rendered each individual into a mechanistic part of an industrialized system of production, from being a person capable of defining their value through direct, purposeful activity. Moreover, the near-total mechanization and automation of the industrial production system would allow the (newly) dominant bourgeois capitalist social class to exploit the working class to the degree that the value obtained from their labour would diminish the ability of the worker to materially survive. Hence, when the proletarian working-class become a sufficiently developed political force, they will effect a revolution and re-orient the relations of production to the means of production—from a capitalist mode of production to a communist mode of production. In the resultant communist society, the fundamental relation of the workers to the means of production would be equal and non-conflictual because there would be no artificial distinctions about the value of a worker's labour; the worker's humanity (species-essence) thus respected, men and women would not become alienated (see Marx's theory of human nature).\n\nIn the communist socio-economic organization, the relations of production would operate the mode of production and employ each worker according to their abilities and benefit each worker according to their needs. Hence, each worker could direct their labour to productive work suitable to their own innate abilities, rather than be forced into a narrowly defined, minimal-wage \"job\" meant to extract maximal profit from individual labour as determined by and dictated under the capitalist mode of production. In the classless, collectively-managed communist society, the exchange of value between the objectified productive labour of one worker and the consumption benefit derived from that production will not be determined by or directed to the narrow interests of a bourgeois capitalist class, but instead will be directed to meet the needs of each producer and consumer. Although production will be differentiated by the degree of each worker's abilities, the purpose of the communist system of industrial production will be determined by the collective requirements of society, not by the profit-oriented demands of a capitalist social class who live at the expense of the greater society. Under the collective ownership of the means of production, the relation of each worker to the mode of production will be identical and will assume the character that corresponds to the universal interests of the communist society. The direct distribution of the fruits of the labour of each worker to fulfill the interests of the working class—and thus to an individuals own interest and benefit—will constitute an un-alienated state of labour conditions, which restores to the worker the fullest exercise and determination of their human nature.\n\nCapitalism reduces the labour of the worker to a commercial commodity that can be traded in the competitive labour-market, rather than as a constructive socio-economic activity that is part of the collective common effort performed for personal survival and the betterment of society. In a capitalist economy, the businesses who own the means of production establish a competitive labour-market meant to extract from the worker as much labour (value) as possible in the form of capital. The capitalist economy's arrangement of the relations of production provokes social conflict by pitting worker against worker in a competition for \"higher wages\", thereby alienating them from their mutual economic interests; the effect is a false consciousness, which is a form of ideological control exercised by the capitalist bourgeoisie through its cultural hegemony. Furthermore, in the capitalist mode of production the philosophic collusion of religion in justifying the relations of production facilitates the realization and then worsens the alienation (\"Entfremdung\") of the worker from their humanity; it is a socio-economic role independent of religion being \"the opiate of the masses\".\n\nIn Marxist theory, \"Entfremdung\" (alienation) is a foundational proposition about man's progress towards self-actualisation. In the \"Oxford Companion to Philosophy\" (2005), Ted Honderich described the influences of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Ludwig Feuerbach upon Karl Marx: For Hegel, the unhappy consciousness is divided against itself, separated from its \"essence\", which it has placed in a \"beyond\". \n\nAs used by the philosophers Hegel and Marx, the reflexive German verbs \"entäussern\" (\"to divest one's self of\") and \"entfremden\" (\"to become estranged\") indicate that the term \"alienation\" denotes self-alienation: to be estranged from one's essential nature. Therefore, alienation is a lack of self-worth, the absence of meaning in one's life, consequent to being coerced to lead a life without opportunity for self-fulfillment, without the opportunity to become actualized, to become one's self.\n\nIn \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (1807), Hegel described the stages in the development of the human \"Geist\" (\"Spirit\"), by which men and women progress from ignorance to knowledge, of the self and of the world. Developing Hegel's human-spirit proposition, Marx said that those poles of idealism—\"spiritual ignorance\" and \"self-understanding\"—are replaced with material categories, whereby \"spiritual ignorance\" becomes \"alienation\" and \"self-understanding\" becomes man's realisation of his \"Gattungswesen\" (species-essence).\n\nIn Part I: \"Feuerbach – Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlook\" of \"The German Ideology\" (1846), Karl Marx said the following:Things have now come to such a pass that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces, not only to achieve self-activity, but also, merely, to safeguard their very existence.\n\nThat humans psychologically require the life activities that lead to their self-actualisation as persons remains a consideration of secondary historical relevance because the capitalist mode of production eventually will exploit and impoverish the proletariat until compelling them to social revolution for survival. Yet, social alienation remains a practical concern, especially among the contemporary philosophers of Marxist humanism. In \"The Marxist-Humanist Theory of State-Capitalism\" (1992), Raya Dunayevskaya discussed and described the existence of the desire for self-activity and self-actualisation among wage-labour workers struggling to achieve the elementary goals of material life in a capitalist economy.\n\nIn Chapter 4 of \"The Holy Family\" (1845), Marx said that capitalists and proletarians are equally alienated, but that each social class experiences alienation in a different form: The propertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human self-estrangement. But the former class feels at ease and strengthened in this self-estrangement, it recognizes estrangement as its own power, and has in it the semblance of a human existence. The class of the proletariat feels annihilated, this means that they cease to exist in estrangement; it sees in it its own powerlessness and in the reality of an inhuman existence. It is, to use an expression of Hegel, in its abasement, the indignation at that abasement, an indignation to which it is necessarily driven by the contradiction between its human nature and its condition of life, which is the outright, resolute and comprehensive negation of that nature. Within this antithesis, the private property-owner is therefore the conservative side, and the proletarian the destructive side. From the former arises the action of preserving the antithesis, from the latter the action of annihilating it.\n\nIn discussion of \"random materialism\" (\"matérialisme aléatoire\"), the French philosopher Louis Althusser criticized such a teleological (goal-oriented) interpretation of Marx's theory of alienation because it rendered the proletariat as the subject of history; an interpretation tainted with the Hegelian idealism of the \"philosophy of the subject\", which he criticized as the \"bourgeois ideology of philosophy\" (see \"History and Class Consciousness\" [1923] by György Lukács).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32623871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32623871", "title": "National Life Stories", "text": "National Life Stories\n\nNational Life Stories is an independent charitable trust and limited company (registered as the ‘National Life Story Collection’) based within the British Library Oral History section, whose key focus and expertise is oral history fieldwork. Since 1987 National Life Stories (NLS) has initiated a series of innovative interviewing projects funded almost entirely from sponsorship, charitable and individual donations.\n\nEach NLS project is archived at the British Library and comprises recorded in-depth interviews, plus content summaries and (if funds allow) transcripts to assist users. Alongside the British Library’s oral history collections, which stretch back to the beginning of the twentieth century, NLS recordings form a unique and invaluable record of people’s lives in Britain today.\n\nThe proposal for NLS was first developed by Paul Thompson (oral historian) and Asa Briggs in 1985-6. The project for a ‘National Life Story Collection’ had a number of distinct features; it was to be a ‘life story’ project intending to collect full autobiographical material including both written autobiographies as well as recorded ‘oral history’. And it was intended to 'record first-hand experiences of as wide a cross-section of present-day society as possible' combining recordings with both elites (who at that time had been largely neglected by British oral historians) and a cross-section of ordinary men and women.\n\nDuring 1986 Thompson and Briggs recruited a distinguished body of trustees, including Baroness Ewart-Biggs, Penelope Lively, Austin Mitchell, Sir Russell Johnson MP, Robert Blake, Elizabeth Longford, Professor Peter Laslett, Professor John Saville and Jack Jones (trade unionist). Advisors included Melvyn Bragg. Other important early trustees included the property developer Jack Rose and the first Treasurer, Peter Hands. With Lord Briggs as Chairman and Paul Thompson as Director, an inaugural meeting of the National Life Story Collection (NLS) as a company was held on 11 November 1986, and registration as a charity was obtained in October 1987. \n\nInitial endowment funding for NLS came from Paul Thompson’s gift of a Henry Moore sculpture (Working Model For Draped Seated Woman: Figure On Steps), which was sold in 1987, as well as donations from the Wingate Foundation and the Nuffield Foundation. \n\nNLS gained the early support of Dr Christopher Roads, Director of the National Sound Archive (1983 - 1992) and in return for archiving interviews, NLS was given a free office in the National Sound Archive (then at Exhibition Road, London), materials and technical support. The appointment of a Curator in Oral History, whose role would be to work closely with the National Life Story Collection, was made in late 1988 (Dr Rob Perks, who took over from Thompson as NLS Director in 1995). The first projects established (all in 1988) were City Lives, The Living Memory of the Jewish Community and Leaders of National Life. Artists’ Lives, established in 1990, is the longest running continuous project, with more than 350 interviews. In 2005 National Life Stories was adopted as a trading name.\n\nNLS was initially conceived to have two spheres of activity. One sphere was the creation of a ‘Life Story Archive’ of manuscript autobiographies. However, the main focus was always to be the creation of a ‘National Biography in Sound’, a collection of recorded and transcribed interviews of two kinds; the first was ‘autobiographical interviews with leading British men and women in all fields - politics, industry, administration, the professions, culture or religion’; and interviews with systematic representatives of ordinary citizens, beginning with a national cross-section of all classes and regions, and then concentrating on particular groups in special need of being recorded. All NLS projects were to follow the in-depth life story approach, starting with family background and childhood, and moving on to education, work and leisure and the community. This methodology has continued to be followed for projects, and each NLS interview normally averages 8 to 15 hours in length.\n\nEarly Projects\nThe first NLS project was Leaders of National Life which began in 1988 and which is still added to occasionally. The project aimed to ‘record autobiographical interviews with leading British men and women covering their life experience as a whole’ with subjects selected from all fields – including politics, industry, administration, the professions, culture or religion – in order to achieve a balance. The project specifically aimed to collect interviews with those life stories had not been recorded or published. \n\nAs well as the Leaders of National Life project, which was funded from NLS’s core funds, NLS sought to undertake ‘Special Collections’ with funding sought from professional associations, industry and other institutions - this is the model which has been used ever since. One of the first of these projects was City Lives, which also began in 1988. It was led by Paul Thompson (with particularly important help from Sir Nicholas Goodison) and later by Cathy Courtney. City Lives was funded entirely from within the City, mostly from smaller donations, but including an especially important grant from the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation. This project resulted in a unique collection of nearly 150 in-depth interviews of the financial elite of the City of London. The project culminated in an exhibition of memorabilia and photographic portraits of City interviewees at the Bank of England Museum, and in the publication of the book City Lives: The Changing Voices of British Finance (Methuen, 1996, ), edited by Cathy Courtney with an introduction by Paul Thompson. A follow-up project, focusing specifically on Barings Bank (An Oral History of Barings) began in 2009 in partnership with the Baring Archive. \n\nAnother ‘Special Collection’, also begun in 1988, was The Living Memory of the Jewish Community (which ran until 1999); the project was led by Jennifer Wingate and received donations from Lord Young and the Clore Foundation. Although the original concept was broader, the project quickly focused its aims on the recording of Jewish Holocaust survivors in Britain, which at that time had been neglected. This project (helped with funding secured through Martin Paisner and the Edith and Ferdinand Porjes Charitable Trust) culminated with the publication of an educational pack, Voices of the Holocaust (British Library, 1994) edited by Carrie Supple and Rob Perks; the educational pack later became an online web resource on the British Library website, Voices of the Holocaust. \n\nVisual Arts and Crafts\nNLS has shown a strong emphasis on recording those involved in the visual arts and in design in general, from architects to theatre designers. The first project to concentrate on the arts was Artists’ Lives, which began in 1990 with crucial seed money for five initial interviews provided by the Henry Moore Foundation. The project, which by 2011 had over 300 interviews, is directed by Cathy Courtney and is run in collaboration with Tate. Artists’ Lives has concentrated on painters (through grants especially from the Linbury Trust, the Elephant Trust, the Pilgrim Trust, the Paul Hamlyn Foundation and the Arts Council England) and sculptors (with key support from the Henry Moore Foundation). A smaller proportion of interviews have been carried out with ‘art professionals’ (with support from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation). The project had had a number of published outputs including the CDs The Sculptor Speaks: Extracts From Recordings With Post-War British Sculptors and Connecting Lines: Artists Talk About Drawing (which is also available online via the British Library’s website. Some of the interviews with no access restrictions are available online to those within UK Higher Education via the British Library Sounds website. In addition, all of the open interviews, with no access restrictions, are available to researchers at Tate Archive. Recordings sponsored by the Henry Moore Foundation are available at the Henry Moore Institute; recordings sponsored by the Fleming Collection are available via the National Gallery of Scotland archive, and those sponsored by the Yale Center for British Art are available through their archives. \n\nArchitects’ Lives began in 1990 and at 2011 had interviewed more than 100 architects. Crafts Lives began in 1999 and, at 2011 has interviewed over 100 studio crafts practitioners including glass artists, textile artists and furniture makers. Interviews from Architects' Lives and Crafts Lives are available via the British Library Sounds website. Other NLS projects concentrating on visual arts and design (but which are no longer in-progress) include An Oral History of British Fashion (2002 – 2007); and An Oral History of British Theatre Design (2005 – 2008). A project recording the life stories of British Photographers (An Oral History of British Photography) is carried out by the British Library’s Oral History section; some of the interviews with no access restrictions are available online to those within UK Higher Education via the British Library Sounds website. \n\nIndustry and Utilities\nNLS has always strived to capture the life stories of those involved in industry. The original idea was for a project on ‘Industrial Lives’, to collect life story interviews from top industrial management from the 1950s onwards, in both public and private industries. However, instead of one large project more industry-specific projects emerged. The first of many projects to focus on British utility companies was Lives in Steel (1991 – 1992), which was funded by the General Division of British Steel through the support of David Grieves. This project resulted in the recording of 90 interviews by Alan Dein of former and current staff at all levels of the industry from directors to manual workers. In 1999 another project focusing on British industry, Lives in the Oil Industry, began, a partnership with the University of Aberdeen, running until 2004. The project resulted in an archive of interviews with 177 people involved in all sectors of the industry; a number of BBC Radio 4 Archive Hours have used material from the archive. The most recent project to focus on the British utility industries is An Oral History of the Water Industry, which began in 2009 with sponsorship from Cambridge Water, Northumbria Water, Scottish Water, Southern Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water. \n\nThe largest project to focus on one industrial sector was Food: From Source to Salespoint, which ran between 1995 and 2007 and resulted in an archive of over 202 interviews. The project covered many aspects of the UK food industry, from production through to consumption, and interviewed farmers, butchers, supermarket workers, food technologists and retailers, amongst others. It received sponsorship from a number of the livery companies as well as UK food manufacturers. A supplementary set of recordings with Chefs, generously funded by Sir John Craven, began 2009, and Tesco funded their own oral history project (but conducted by NLS) between 2003 – 2007 (Tesco: An Oral History). An Oral History of the Wine Trade (2003 – 2005), was funded by the Vintners' Company and the Institute of Masters of Wine, and gathered a further forty interviews.\n\nBusinesses and Corporations\nNational Life Stories has worked in partnership with a number of individual businesses and corporations to collect oral histories with employees from all levels of a corporation. An Oral History of Barings, a project in partnership with the Baring Archive, includes interviews with employees from all levels of the bank, including messengers, secretaries, and one of the bank’s first female senior executives. Other corporate-specific projects have been undertaken with the brand consultancy Wolff Olins (An Oral History of Wolff Olins), the Royal Mail Group and The British Postal Museum & Archive (An Oral History of the Post Office) and with Tesco (Tesco: An Oral History).\n\nWriting and Publishing\n\nBook Trade Lives, which was led by Martyn Goff and which received generous funding from the Unwin Foundation, ran between 1997 and 2006. The project interviewed nearly 120 of those involved in bookselling from the 1920s through the twentieth century, including secretaries, sales managers, editors and publishers' representatives, and specialists in production and design. A CD featuring extracts from the project entitled Book Trade Lives was published by The British Library in 2002 and over 80 interviews from Book Trade Lives were used in The British Book Trade: An Oral History (British Library, 2008 and 2010), edited by the project interviewer Sue Bradley. A complimentary project, Authors’ Lives began in 2007, and includes life story interviews with novelists, poets, biographers, historians and children’s writers. The Writing Life: Authors Speak, a CD containing edited extracts from the collection was published in 2011. An Oral History of British Press ran between 1994 and 2006, and collected the life stories of key press and newspaper figures. \n\nScience\nIn 2009 NLS received funding from the Arcadia Fund and the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 for a new project (Oral History of British Science). The project has collected over 100 audio interviews, each 8 to 15 hours in length, with scientists, engineers and others linked with science and technology in Britain, as well as shorter on-location video recordings, over two themed strands: Made in Britain and A Changing Planet. In 2013 National Life Stories began a new oral history project entitled 'Inspiring Scientists: Diversity in British Science', in partnership with the Royal Society Diversity Programme. Interviewees range from Professors to PhD students and the focus on science is wide, covering academia, big industry and individual entrepreneurship. Many of the interviews recorded for the projects are available in full on British Library Sounds, while the Voices of Science web resource provides curated access to audio and video highlights from the interviews organised by theme, discipline and interviewee.\n\nOther Projects\nThe Fawcett Collection was a project supported by The Women’s Library, which ran between 1990 and 1992, collecting. Rebecca Abrams’ book, Woman in a Man's World (Methuen, 1993, ) was based on this collection.\n\nPioneers in Charity and Social Welfare (2004 – present) was initiated with funding from the J. Paul Getty Jnr Charitable Trust, and comprises interviews with key (and often unsung) individuals connected to social welfare, social policy and charity work. \n\nA National Cross-Section\nThe attempt to record a ‘national cross-section’ of life stories of ordinary men and women has been approached in a number of different ways. The first was through a life story competition. In 1991 NLS received a pilot grant from the Literature section of the Arts Council of England to develop the National Life Story Awards as an independent written and audio autobiographical competition; additional funding was received from the European Community Year of Older People and ITV Telethon. The project was especially well-publicised on both radio and television, and the ambitious official launch included Lord Soper, Baroness Blackstone and Glenda Jackson. There were nearly 950 entries, of which 710 were written and 217 recorded (fifteen in video); twenty entries reached the final shortlist all of which highlighted a striking range of social background. The judges for the final round were Asa Briggs, Penelope Lively, Ann Paul, Rob Perks and Paul Thompson (oral historian), and the awards ceremony at the Barbican in September 1994 was compared by Melvyn Bragg, one of NLS’s long-standing Advisors.\n\nA second initiative for a national ‘memory bank’ was first discussed in 1996 and an application was made to the Millennium Commission. Eventually a joint scheme (1998 – 2000), with the British Library leading with NLS as a partner along with the BBC, resulted in The Century Speaks: Millennium Oral History Project, archived at the British Library as The Millennium Memory Bank.\n\n\nAll NLS interviews and projects are catalogued on the British Library Sound & Moving Image catalogue. Researchers can listen to interviews onsite at the British Library at St Pancras and Boston Spa, either by making an appointment with the Listening & Viewing Service or, if the interview is available digitally, via the SoundServer service. Some NLS interviews (from Artist’ Lives, Architects’ Lives, The Living Memory of the Jewish Community, Millennium Memory Bank and An Oral History of British Science) are available via the British Library Sounds website.\n\nUpdates on NLS projects are available through the National Life Stories Annual Reports and also through the British Library's Sound and Vision blog and, specifically for Oral History of British Science, the History of Science blog.\n\nChairman\n\nDirector\n\nTreasurer\n\nTrustees\n"}

In 1844, he created a unique alphabet for the Albanian language using characters he had created himself, the Vithkuqi script. Veqilharxhi is one of the most prominent figures of the early Albanian National Awakening, and is considered by Albanians as its first ideologue.\n\nNaum Veqilharxhi was born Naum Bredhi in 1797 in the village of Vithkuq, near Korçë, southern Albania. His father, Panajot Bredhi, was a steward of Ali Pashë Tepelena, the ruler of the Pashalik of Janina. After the destruction of Vithkuq in 1819, he sought a better life in Romania. As a student he took part in the Wallachian uprising of 1821. A few years later he worked in Brăila as a lawyer, became wealthy and used his money to promote the ideas of the Albanian National Awakening. In Brăila he joined an intellectual organization of Albanians, who considered the development of Albanian language and culture necessary for the Albanian National Awakening.\n\nIn 1824 or 1825 he started the creation of his alphabet of the Albanian language. The final version of his thirty-three-letter Vithkuqi alphabet, whose characters were invented by Veqilharxhi, was printed as part of primer in 1844-5 titled \"Evëtori Shqip Fort i Shkurtër\" (). Veqilharxhi avoided the use of Latin, Greek or Arabic alphabets and characters because of their religious associations and the possibility of causing divisions among Albanians of different religions. Veqilarxhi's \"Evëtor\" first distributed in Korçë and later westwards as far as Berat, where it reached great success. It was also circulated in Përmet. On April 22, 1845 Athanas Paskali, one of the notable people of Korçë, along with others sent him a letter requesting as many more copies as possible. Among Albanian historians this publication by Veqilharxhi is considered as the beginning of the Albanian national awakening.\n\nIn 1845 Veqilharxhi sent a polemic open letter written in the Greek language to his nephew, who had called his patriotic ideas \"chimera\": the letter is considered to be one of the first written documents to record the main ideas of the Albanian National Awakening movement. His death is thought to have been from poisoning by orders from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nOutside of his native land Veqilharxhi in Romania was a figure that thrived within the security of the Albanian diaspora where both worlds became linked together, a dynamic that led thereafter to the development of Albanianism by other Albanians.\n\nVeqilharxhi lamented the \"backwardness\" of his homeland and attributed it to centuries of Ottoman rule, and argued that a new unifying Albanian alphabet was necessary to overcome the stagnation and unify the country. He was concerned by the lack of Albanian schools, and saw the development of written Albanian as a necessary precursor to cultural and political development. Veqilharxhi felt that education in one's mother tongue was important toward acquiring knowledge and \"culture\". In one preface written to Albanian schoolboys, he berates Albanian children who did \"not know their own heritage; not only are they unable to write in their own language, they cannot even pray to the Lord in the language each of them tasted with his mother’s milk\", and for learning only the languages of foreignors and not their own. He urged Albanian boys to study their own language in order to \"join the civilized world, prove that our land is idle no longer and show ourselves as men of great honor\", and compared the Albanian nation to a \"larva\" that may one day become a butterfly.\n\nIt has been argued that, in his formative earlier years, Veqilharxhi was influenced by Greek nationalism and was a member of the Filiki Eteria. In 1821, he took part in the Romanian uprising in Wallachia during his stay there. In his later years, he warned that \"Greek schools are organized to illuminate Greek youth and not to illuminate the Albanian people\", and felt that native language education was necessary to prevent Hellenisation.\n\nVeqilharxhi is considered to be the first written ideologue of Albanian nationalism and the first to formulate its ideals, as well as the first enlightener of the Albanian National Awakening. Attached to his Evëtor was a primer addressed to Orthodox Albanians, which became the first programme document of the Albanian national movement.\n\nVeqilharxhi conceived of Albania as a nation with its own language, customs and history, and its own territory. His conception of Albania included a harmony between the different faiths practiced by Albanians, with each faith being practiced by Albanians a little bit differently than it would be by non-Albanians, which would evolve into the Albanian national ideal of religious harmony. He also helped Albanian nationalism take its ultimate course of using language, rather than religion as other Balkan nationalisms did, as its primary unifier.\n"}
{"id": "2863150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2863150", "title": "Nirukta", "text": "Nirukta\n\nNirukta (, ) means \"explained, interpreted\" and refers to one of the six ancient Vedangas, or ancillary science connected with the Vedas – the scriptures of Hinduism. Nirukta covers etymology, and is the study concerned with correct interpretation of Sanskrit words in the Vedas. \n\n\"Nirukta\" is the systematic creation of a glossary and it discusses how to understand archaic, uncommon words. The field grew probably because almost a quarter of words in the Vedic texts composed in the 2nd-millennium BCE appear just once.\n\nThe study of \"Nirukta\" can be traced to the last centuries of the 2nd-millennium BCE Brahmanas layer of the Vedic texts. However, the most ancient complete surviving text of this field is a commentary on \"Nighantu\" by , who probably lived about the 7th century BCE. His text is also referred simply as \"Nirukta\". The study of \"Nirukta\" has been closely related to the ancillary Vedic science of \"Vyakarana\", but they have a different focus. \"Vyakarana\" deals with linguistic analysis to establish the exact form of words to properly express ideas, while Nirukta focuses on linguistic analysis to help establish the proper meaning of the words, given the context they are used in. Yaska asserts that the prerequisite to the study of \"Nirukta\" is the study of \"Vyakarana\".\n\nThe texts of the \"Nirukta\" field of study are also called Nirvacana shastra. A critical edition of the Nighantu and the Nirukta was published by Lakshman Sarup in the 1920s.\n\nNirukta (Sanskrit), states Monier-Williams, means \"uttered, pronounced, explained, expressed, defined, loud\". It also refers to the etymological interpretation of a word, also the name of such works.\n\nThe related Sanskrit noun \"\" means \"poetical derivation\" or \"explanation of a word.\"\n\nThe field of \"Nirukta\" deals with ascertaining the meaning of words, particularly of archaic words no longer in use, ones created long ago and even then rarely used. The Vedic literature from the 2nd millennium BCE has a very large collection of such words, with nearly 25% of the words therein being used just once. By the 1st millennium BCE, interpreting and understanding what the Vedas meant had become a challenge, and \"Nirukta\" attempted to systematically propose theories on how words form, and then determine their meaning in order to understand the Vedas.\n\nYaska, the sage who likely lived around the 7th-century BCE, approached this problem through a semantic analysis of words, by breaking them down into their components, and then combined them in the context they were used to propose what the archaic words could have meant.\nDon't memorize, seek the meaning<br>What has been taken [from the teacher's mouth] but not understood,<br>is uttered by mere [memory] recitation,<br>it never flares up, like dry firewood without fire.<br>Many a one, [although] seeing, do not see Speech,<br>many a one, [although] hearing, do not hear Her,<br> and many a one, She spreads out [Her] body, like a wife desiring her husband.<br>The meaning of Speech, is its fruit and flower.\n— Yaska, \"Nirukta 1.18-1.20\"\nA central premise of Yaska was that man creates more new words to conceptualize and describe action, that is nouns often have verbal roots. However, added Yaska, not all words have verbal roots. He asserted that both the meaning and the etymology of words are always context dependent. Words are created around object-agent, according to Yaska, to express external or internal reality perceived by man, and are one of six modifications of \"Kriya\" (action) and \"Bhava\" (dynamic being), namely being born, existing, changing, increasing, decreasing and perishing.\n\nA sentence is a collection of words, a word is a collection of phonemes, according to Nirukta scholars of Hindu traditions. The meaning of Vedic passages has to be understood through context, purpose stated, subject matter being discussed, what is stated, how, where and when.\n\nThe only basic \"Nirvacana shastra\" (Nirukta-related text) that has survived from ancient times into the modern era is the one by Yaska, and it is simply called \"Nirukta\". Three bhasya (commentaries) on Yaska's \"Nirukta\" have also survived. Additionally, a related work that is extant and is more ancient than the 7th-century BCE \"Nirukta\" by Yaska, is the \"Nighantu\" which is a lexicographic treatise. The \"Nighantu\" is a glossary or compilation of words in the Vedas, and is an example text of \"Abhidhanashastra\" (literally, science of words). However, \"Nighantu\" is not a dictionary, a genre of texts that developed in later centuries and was called a \"Kosha\" in Sanskrit. Yaska's \"Nirukta\" extensively refers to the \"Nighantu\".\n\nThe three commentaries on Yaska's \"Nirukta\" text are by Hindu scholars named Durgasinha (also known as Durga) who likely lived before the 6th-century CE, Skanda-Mahesvara who may be two scholars who probably lived before the 5th-century CE, and Nilakantha who probably is from the 14th-century.\n\nYaska, in his famous text titled \"Nirukta\", asserts that Rigveda in the ancient tradition, can be interpreted in three ways - from the perspective of religious rites (\"adhiyajna\"), from the perspective of the deities (\"adhidevata\"), and from the perspective of the soul (\"adhyatman\"). The fourth way to interpret the Rigveda also emerged in the ancient times, wherein the gods mentioned were viewed as symbolism for legendary individuals or narratives. It was generally accepted that creative poets often embed and express double meanings, ellipses and novel ideas to inspire the reader. \"Nirukta\" enables one to identify alternate embedded meanings that poets and writers may have included in old texts.\n\nMany examples of the rhetorical use of nirukta occur in Bhaskararaya's commentaries. Here is an example from the opening verse of his commentary on the Ganesha Sahasranama.\n\nThe opening verse includes ' as a name for Ganesha. The simple meaning of this name, which would have seemed obvious to his readers, would be \"Protector of the Ganas\", parsing the name in a straightforward way as ' (group) + \"nātha\" (protector). But Bhaskararaya demonstrates his skill in nirukta by parsing it in an unexpected way as the Bahuvrīhi compound \"\" + \"atha\" meaning \"the one the enumeration () of whose qualities brings about auspiciousness. The word \"atha\" is associated with auspiciousness ().\" This rhetorical flourish at the opening of the sahasranama demonstrates Bhaskaraya's skills in nirukta at the very beginning of his commentary on a thousand such names, including a clever twist appropriate to the context of a sahasranama.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1528776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1528776", "title": "Parish register", "text": "Parish register\n\nA parish register in an ecclesiastical parish is a handwritten volume, normally kept in the parish church in which certain details of religious ceremonies marking major events such as baptisms (together with the dates and names of the parents), marriages (with the names of the partners), children, and burials (that had taken place within the parish) are recorded. Along with these vital details, church goods, the parish’s response to briefs, and notes on various happenings in the parish were also recorded. These elaborate records existed for the purpose of preventing bigamy and consanguineous marriage. \n\nThe information recorded in registers was also considered significant for secular governments’ own recordkeeping, resulting in the churches supplying the state with copies of all parish registers. A good register permits the family structure of the community to be reconstituted as far back as the sixteenth century. Thus, these records were distilled for the definitive study of the history of several nations’ populations. They also provide insight into the lives and interrelationships of parishioners.\n\nParish registers were formally introduced in England on 5 September 1538 following the split with Rome, when Thomas Cromwell, minister to Henry VIII, issued an injunction requiring the registers of baptisms, marriages and burials to be kept. Before this, a few Roman Catholic religious’ houses and parish priests had kept informal notes on the baptisms, marriages and burials of the prominent local families. This injunction was addressed to the rector or vicar of every parish in England. However, this order had nothing to do with religious doctrine or the papacy and rather indicated the desire of the central government to have full knowledge of the population of the country. The book was to be kept in a \"sure coffer\" with two locks and keys. A fine of 3 sols, 4 deniers was to be levied for failure to comply. Many parishes ignored this order as it was commonly thought that it presaged a further tax.\n\nFinally, in 1597, both Queen and Convocation reaffirmed the injunction, adding that the registers were of \"‘permagnus usus’\" and must be kept in books of parchment leaves. Previous records (most found in a less durable form) had to be copied into the new books and copies of each year’s entries had to be sent to the bishop’s registrar. The parish clerk was paid to copy the old records into a new parchment book in order to keep the record up to date.\n\nDuring the English Civil War (1643–1647) and in the following Commonwealth period, records were poorly kept and many are now missing after being destroyed (bored by beetles, chewed by rats or rendered illegible by damp) or hidden by the clergy. This parsimony and neglect was remedied by depositing the registers in county record offices where they were safeguarded and made accessible. On the other hand, the accurate parish registers of New France were rarely damaged by external events such as war, revolution, and fire. Thus, 300,00 entries were available for the time period 1621 to 1760.\n\nIn 1812 England, an \"Act for the better regulating and preserving Parish and other Registers of Birth, Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, in England\" was passed It stated that \"amending the Manner and Form of keeping and of preserving Registers of Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials of His Majesty's Subjects in the several Parishes and Places in England, will greatly facilitate the Proof of Pedigrees of Persons claiming to be entitled to Real or Personal Estates, and otherwise of great public Benefit and Advantage\". Separate, printed registers were to be supplied by the King's Printer, and used for baptisms, marriages and burials. (James Thomas Law, The ecclesiastical statutes at large, extr. and arranged by J.T. Law) These are more or less unchanged to this day.\n\nIn the United States, at least the parishes in the Roman Catholic dioceses maintained a similar practice of recording baptisms, marriages, burials, and often also confirmations and first communions. From the earliest pioneer churches ministered by itinerant priests, the records were written in ecclesiastical Latin. But after the Second Vatican Council and its reforms that included translating the Mass into local languages, most register entries gradually came to be written in English. In Protestant communions with stronger similarities to Roman Catholicism, parish registers are also important sources that document baptisms, marriages, and funerals. In Protestant and Evangelical churches, individual ministers often kept records of faith-related events among the congregation, but under much less guidance from any central governing body.\n\nThe parish register became mandatory in Italy for baptisms and marriages in 1563 after the Council of Trent and in 1614 for burials when its rules of compilation were as well normalised by the Church. Prior to 1563, the oldest registers of baptisms are preserved since 1379 in Gemona del Friuli, 1381 in Siena, 1428 in Florence or 1459 in Bologna.\n\nIn France, parish registers have been in use since the Middle Ages. The oldest surviving registers date back to 1303 and are posted in Givry. Other existing registers prior to orders of civil legislation in 1539 reside in Roz-Landrieux 1451, Paramé 1453, Lanloup 1467, Trans-la-Forêt 1479 and Signes 1500.\n\nThe parish register became mandatory in France for baptisms with the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts signed into law by Francis I of France on August 10, 1539, then for marriages and burials with the Ordinance of Blois in 1579. They had to be sent every year to the bailiwick or \"sénéchaussée\" in the south of France. In April 1667, the Ordinance of Saint-Germain-en-Laye ordered a copy to be kept by the parish clergy as before the ordinance. By decree of the National Assembly of September 20, 1792, the keeping of the civil registers was given to mayors and the old parish registers went then to the public records of the \"archives communales,\" and the old bailiwick registers to the \"archives departementales\" created in 1796. But from 1795, the parish again kept some private registers, like the \"registres de catholicité\" for the Catholic Church which are also made in duplicate, one for the parish and one for the diocesan archives. The legalization of these documents, functioning both as a means of census as well as civil documentation, has in some cases been used to restore official acts of civil status such as after the downfall of the Paris commune and the reconstruction of Le Palais de Justice after the fires of 1871.\n\nThe first Europeans to settle in North America continued the practice of establishing parish registers. Shortly after the establishment of Habitation, the arrival of Jesuit priests in 1615 facilitated the earliest beginnings of the parish register in New France.These earliest accounts entered into the register were recorded primarily within the Jesuits personal logs, and accounted exclusively for the number of deaths in the early settlement period of Quebec.However, over time the growing French population propagated the development and detailing of the parish register. Entries detailing births, marriages, baptisms and deaths were recorded and kept in the church of Notre Dame-de-la-Recouvrance. Unfortunately, in 1640 the church burned along with all parish records from 1620 to 1640. After the church burned, the parish priest commissioned at Notre Dame-de-la- Recouverance reconstructed the destroyed register entries from memory by recording the rather limited number of births, baptisms and marriages to take place within the colony during this 20-year period. Deaths however, were not recorded in the reconstructed registers and as a consequence there is no recorded account of the death of Samuel de Champlain who died in 1635.\n\nAlthough the creating and maintaining parish registers in Europe had been in practice since the Middle Ages, legislation regarding the widespread and legal use of parish registers in France was officially passed into law with the signing of the Ordnance of Villers-Cotterets in 1539. However, it was not until 1666 where after perceiving the immense advantages to be gained through civil registration that King Louis XIV revitalized the parish registration system in France and her colonies. This edict, set forth by the king, made it compulsory for individuals to register within their parish communities. Moreover, in 1667 the king revealed the Ordonnance de Saint Germain en Laye, a piece of legislation which required parish priests to produce a duplicate of all registers so that all copies may be stored in emerging records offices. In New France, these duplicates were stored in Quebec and Montreal’s Courts of Justice official records office and listed New France’s Roman Catholic population exclusively. It was only until after cession and the British conquest of New France in 1760 that parish registers began to more openly include Protestants within the registry, and as civil subjects of Quebec.\n\nParish registers have been kept for each parish by the Church of Sweden for some Swedish counties (Västmanland and Dalarna) since the 1620s, and generally for the whole Sweden since the 1670s. The church was ordered to keep even more detailed church books in king Charles XI's Church Law from 1686. The primary motivation was to keep track of the number of soldiers that were taken out from each parish, and that were financed by each parish, through the allotment system that was introduced in 1682. Another motivation was to keep track of religious knowledge, literacy and health among the population. The church books constitute of birth, death, marriage and moving in/out records, all of which were linked to the parish catechetical book, which was replaced in 1895 by the parish book. In country side parishes, each village or industrial town had its own section in the catechetical book, each farmyard its own page, and each person its own row. For city parishes, the book was divided into districts. The majority of church records are still preserved in the state archives, and available electronically over the Internet.\n\nThe contents have changed over time, not being standardised in England until the Acts of 1753 and 1812. The following are among what you can expect to find in later registers, though in the earlier ones it is quite common to find only names recorded. Early entries will be in some form of Latin, often abbreviated.\n\n\n\n\nDade and Barrington Registers are detailed registers that contain more information than standard contemporary baptism and burial registers. They usually commence in the late eighteenth century, but come to an end in 1812, when they were superseded by the requirements of George Rose’s 1812 Act, which required more information to be recorded than in normal registers, but actually required less information to be recorded than in Dade and Barrington Registers. There are examples of a few parishes continuing to keep Dade or Barrington Registers after 1813. In some cases, two registers were kept, for example in the Co Durham parish of Whickham both Barrington and Rose Registers were kept for the period 1813-1819, after which the former were discontinued.\n\nWilliam Dade, a Yorkshire clergyman of the 18th century, was ahead of his time, in seeing the value of including as much information on individuals in the parish register as possible. In 1777 Archbishop William Markham decided that Dade's scheme of registration forms should be introduced throughout his diocese. The resulting registers, and some that are related, are now known as \"Dade registers\". The baptismal registers were to include child's name, seniority (e.g. first son), father's name, profession, place of abode and descent (i.e. names, professions and places of abode of the father's parents), similar information about the mother, and mother's parents, the infant's date of birth and baptism. Registers of this period are a gold-mine for genealogists, but the scheme was so much work for the parish priests that it did not last long.\n\nIn 1770 Dade wrote in the parish register of St. Helen's, York: \"This scheme if properly put in execution will afford much clearer intelligence to the researches of posterity than the imperfect method hitherto generally pursued.\" His influence spread and the term Dade register has come to describe any parish registers that include more detail than expected for the time.\n\nThe application of this system was somewhat haphazard and many clergymen, particularly in more populated areas, resented the extra work involved in making these lengthy entries. The thought of duplicating them for the Bishop’s Transcripts put many of them off and some refused to follow the new rules. Several letters of complaint were printed in the York newspapers of the time, and the scheme suffered when the Archbishop indicated there was no punishment for vicars who failed to comply.\n\nThe Borthwick Institute for Archives recommends that researchers looking at Yorkshire parishes between 1770 and 1812 should check both sources.\n\nFrom about 1783, as Lord Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt Rev. Shute Barrington instigated a similar system somewhat simpler than Dade's, and followed this in Northumberland and Durham from 1798, when he was translated to the diocese of Durham.\n\nMost registers in the world have been deposited in diocesan archives or county record offices. Where these have been filmed, copies are available to scan from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through the Family History Library. Microfiche copies of parish registers, along with transcriptions, are usually available at larger local libraries and county record offices.\n\nSince Victorian times, amateur genealogists have transcribed and indexed parish registers. Some societies have also produced printed transcripts and indexes — notably the Parish Register Society, the Harleian Society and Phillimore & Co. The Society of Genealogists, in London, has a very large selection of such transcripts and indexes. The LDS Library in Salt Lake City also has a vast collection of films of original registers.\n\nThe LDS, for its own purposes, has also produced an index (the IGI), of very many register entries — mostly baptisms and marriages. The IGI is available as an online database and on microform matter at local \"Family History Centers\". Like all transcripts and indexes, the IGI should be used with caution, as errors can occur in legibility of the original or microfilm of the original, in reading the original handwriting, and in entering the material to the transcription. \"Batch entries\" are generally more reliable than \"individual submissions.\"\n\n\nDelsalle, Paul. 2009. \"Histoires de familles: les registres paroissiaux et d'état civil, du Moyen Âge à nos jours : démographie et généalogie\".

On his return in 1865 he was appointed professor of Latin philology at the Catholic University of Leuven; here he spent the remainder of his life, the only events being his lectures and his works.\n\nHis two chief works are \"Le droit public romain\" (Roman Public Law), first issued under the title, \"Les antiquités romains envisagées au point de vue des institutions politiques\" (Louvain, 1870; 7th ed. by his son Joseph Willems, Louvain, 1910), and \"Le sénat de la republique romaine\" (3 vols., Louvain, 1878–85). The first work is a handbook which stops at Constantine I in the first three editions and now goes as far as Justinian I. The author combined systematic and historical order by dividing the history of Roman institutions into \"epochs\" and \"periods\", viz., epoch of royalty, epoch of the republic, epoch of the empire, subdivided into the period of the Principate and that of monarchy. In each of these sections Willems studies the conditions of persons, government, and administration.\n\nThe book on the Roman Senate shows more evidence of personal research. It contains a new opinion concerning the recruiting of the Senate; Willems does not admit that there were plebeian senators in the century following the expulsion of the kings. It was by the exercise of the \"curule\" magistracies that the plebs entered the Senate, in fact after 354-200; a plebiscite proposed by the Tribune Ovinius and accepted at the end of the fourth century hastened the introduction of the plebeians, and, in short, made the Senate an assembly of former magistrates.\n\nHe completed his work by a series of studies on the composition of the Roman Senate in 575-179, in 699-55 in his great work, and in A. D. 65 in the \"Musée belge\" (published by his son, 1902). He also contributed to the \"Bulletins\" of the Brussels Academy a memoir on the municipal elections of Pompeii (1902). He assisted in the foundation of the second Belgian periodical for classical philology, \"Le Musée belge\" (1897), and organized a \"Societas philologa\", at Louvain, one of the oldest members of which was the Liège professor, Charles Michel, author of the \"Recucit d'inscriptions grecques\" (1900–12). He belonged to the Flemish party and collected materials for a work on the Flemish dialects, which remains unfinished.\n\n"}
{"id": "2722794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2722794", "title": "Progress trap", "text": "Progress trap\n\nA progress trap is the condition human societies experience when, in pursuing progress through human ingenuity, they inadvertently introduce problems they do not have the resources or political will to solve, for fear of short-term losses in status, stability or quality of life. This prevents further progress and sometimes leads to societal collapse.\n\nThe syndrome appears to have been first described by Walter Von Krämer, in his series of 1989 articles under the title \"Fortschrittsfalle Medizin\". The specific neologism \"progress trap\" was introduced independently in 1990 by Daniel B. O'Leary with his study of the behavioral aspects of this condition.\n\nThe term subsequently gained attention following the historian and novelist Ronald Wright's 2004 book and Massey Lecture series \"A Short History of Progress\", in which he sketches world history so far as a succession of progress traps. With the documentary film version of Wright's book \"Surviving Progress\", backed by Martin Scorsese, the concept achieved wider recognition. \n\nWhile the idea is not new, Wright identifies the central problem as being one of scale and political will. According to him, the error is often to extrapolate from what appears to work well on a small scale to a larger scale, which depletes natural resources and causes environmental degradation. Large-scale implementation also tends to be subject to diminishing returns. As overpopulation, erosion, greenhouse gas emissions or other consequences become apparent, society is destabilized.\n\nIn a progress trap, those in positions of authority are unwilling to make changes necessary for future survival. To do so they would need to sacrifice their current status and political power at the top of a hierarchy. They may also be unable to raise public support and the necessary economic resources, even if they try. Deforestation and erosion in ancient Greece may be an example of the latter.\n\nA new source of natural resources can provide a reprieve. The European discovery and exploitation of the \"New World\" is one example of this, but seems unlikely to be repeated today. Present global civilization has covered the planet to such an extent there are no new resources in sight. Wright concludes that if not averted by some other means, collapse will be on a global scale, if or when it comes. Current economic crises, population problems and global climate change are symptoms that highlight the interdependence of current national economies and ecologies.\n\nThe problem has deep historical roots, probably dating back to the origins of life on Earth 3.8 billion years ago. In the early stone age, improved hunting techniques in vulnerable areas caused the extinction of many prey species, leaving the enlarged populace without an adequate food supply. The only apparent alternative, agriculture, also proved to be a progress trap. Salination, deforestation, erosion and urban sprawl led to disease, malnutrition and so forth, hence shorter lives.\n\nAlmost any sphere of technology can prove to be a progress trap, as in the example of medicine and its possibly inadequate response to the drawbacks of the high-density agricultural practices (e.g. factory farming) it has enabled. Wright uses weapon technology gradually reaching the threat of total nuclear destruction to illustrate this point. Ultimately, Wright strives to counter at least the Victorian notion of \"modernity\" as unconditionally a good thing.\n\nIn \"Escaping the progress trap\", O'Leary finds that, besides vested interests and socioeconomic compliance, individual behavior is a significant contributing factor to progress traps, which are not limited to technology. This can be verified in terms of new information from the neurosciences, notably lateralization of brain function, where the short-term goals of a man-made world are increasingly favoured over long-term global interests. His study of this shows how institutions and societies can become committed to an exclusive form of technocratic rationalism. In this scenario, humans diverge from a default interdependence with nature with the result that short-term technical preoccupations slowly inhibit creativity and long-term problem solving, thus compromising long-term interests. \n\nWhere advances are created by technical specialization \"and\" are harmful; such as desertification resulting from mismanaged irrigation; this trend compounds itself and can be irreversible, with collapse resulting. Classic cases would be Sumer and the Indus Valley civilization where output-raising irrigation canals and logging slowly combined to make the fields far too salty to continue supporting the harvests on which the populations relied. \n\nOther examples, such as Seymour Cray's overspecialized Control Data Corporation or the Medieval Church's rejection of Roger Bacon's science follow the pattern: The mode of development itself excluded solutions to problems arising from that development. In a contemporary context, unabated oil consumption in a time of climate change is an illustration of the problem; sustainable development is viewed as a solution.\n\nAccording to O'Leary, avoiding the progress trap pattern can be achieved by ensuring, through education and cultural vitality, that individuals and societies do not become preeminently technocratic. Citing research into creativity and resiliency theory, he argues that the intuitive side of the mind/brain must thrive, so that lateral thinking will be an option for seeing and preventing progress traps. Spelling this out in scientific terms may be necessary for policymakers to take notice.\n\nIain McGilchrist's 2009 book \"The Master and His Emissary\", provides neurological insight into behaviors where excessive attention to short-term interests might compromise long-term interests.\n\nAurora Picture Show, a microcinema in Houston, Texas has released a collection of \"informational videos by artists who use recent technological tools for purposes other than what they were designed to do and, in some instances, in direct opposition to their intended use\". The title of the DVD is \"At your service: Escaping the Progress Trap\".\n\n\n"}

It is named after its creator, Sol Spiegelman, of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who first described it in 1965.\n\nSpiegelman introduced RNA from a simple bacteriophage Qβ (Qβ) into a solution which contained Qβ's RNA replicase, some free nucleotides, and some salts. In this environment, the RNA started to be replicated. After a while, Spiegelman took some RNA and moved it to another tube with fresh solution. This process was repeated.\n\nShorter RNA chains were able to be replicated faster, so the RNA became shorter and shorter as selection favored speed. After 74 generations, the original strand with 4,500 nucleotide bases ended up as a dwarf genome with only 218 bases. This short RNA sequence replicated very quickly in these unnatural circumstances.\n\nM. Sumper and R. Luce of Eigen's laboratory demonstrated that a mixture containing no RNA at all but only RNA bases and Qβ replicase can, under the right conditions, spontaneously generate self-replicating RNA which evolves into a form similar to Spiegelman's Monster. Note that despite the term self-replicating RNA, the RNA did not replicate itself: the Qβ enzyme is what made the RNA molecules.\n\n\n"}

Born in Calcutta (in 1944), he was educated in England, India, and Canada.\n\nHe received his schooling at Bemrose School, Derby (UK) and La Martiniere Calcutta. He holds a first class bachelor of engineering (B.E.) degree in metallurgy from the University of Calcutta having studied at Bengal Engineering College (later, Bengal Engineering and Science University, now the Indian Institutes of Engineering Science and Technology), India’s second oldest engineering school. His graduate studies were at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, where he obtained the M.Sc and Ph.D degrees in computer science in 1974 and 1976 respectively.\n\nHe has taught at Ohio State University, University of Alberta, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (where he was the first Dowty Professor of Computer Systems Engineering). Since 1993, he has held the Computer Science Trust Fund Eminent Scholar Chair in the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, where he is also a professor, Department of History and, from 1999 to 2013 was the Director of the Institute of Cognitive Science. He has held visiting appointments in Wolfson College, Oxford, the Computer Laboratory, Cambridge, Simon Fraser University (Vancouver), the Indian Institute of Science and the Center for the Development of Advanced Computing, C-DAC (Bangalore, India), Aachen Technical University, and the University of Oldenberg (both in Germany). He has served as a consultant for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\nDasgupta has featured in interviews and articles in multiple BBC Radio programs, British national newspapers and magazines, Indian national newspapers, and regional Spanish and Canadian newspapers. His biographical entries appear in Who’s Who in America, Who’s Who in the World, Writers Directory, and Contemporary Authors.\n\nSubrata Dasgupta’s research from 1974 to 1991 spanned such branches of computer science as computer architecture, microprogramming, hardware description languages, program verification, and design theory. Since 1992, his work has focused on the cognitive and historical nature of creativity in the natural and artificial sciences, engineering and technology, art, literary scholarship, and cross-cultural milieux. In addition to numerous papers, essays and articles, he is the author of fourteen books.\n\nInfluenced by Herbert Simon’s seminal book \"The Sciences of the Artificial\", Dasgupta has written extensively on the historical, epistemological and cognitive nature of the artificial sciences and, in particular, on computer science as a science of the artificial. His books include: \"The Design and Description of Computer Architectures\" (John Wiley, 1984), \"Computer Architecture: A Modern Synthesis. Volume 1: Foundations\" and \"Volume 2: Advanced Topics\" (John Wiley, 1989), \"Design Theory and Computer Science\" (Cambridge University Press, 1991), and \"It Began with Babbage : The Genesis of Computer Science\" (Oxford University Press, 2014) which was selected as an 'Outstanding Academic Title for 2014' by the journal Choice. Most recently, his \"Computer Science: A Very Short Introduction\" (2016) was published as a volume in Oxford University Press's best-selling and prestigious \"Very Short Introductions\" series.'\n\nHe has published numerous papers and essays on the cognitive-historical-biographical aspects of creativity in art, science, technology and scholarship in such print journals as Perspectives on Science, Transactions of the Newcomen Society, Notes & Records of the Royal Society, Creativity Research Journal, Physics News, Physics of Life Reviews and the online journal PsyArt. His books include \"Creativity in Invention and Design\" (Cambridge University Press, 1994), \"Technology and Creativity\" (Oxford University Press, 1996), \"Jagadis Chandra Bose and the Indian Response to Western Science\" (Oxford University Press, 1999), \n\"Twilight of the Bengal Renaissance: R.K.

This assists families and acquaintances in re-establishing contact, after they have been separated\nby the disruption caused by the disaster.\n\nThere are several databases of survivors of the Nazi genocide of Jewish people during World War II. One of these is the \"Benjamin and Vladka Meed Registry of Holocaust Survivors\" which is now part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nThe Red Cross established a register of survivors of the SS Noronic disaster in 1949. Survivors of the Hurricane Katrina disaster also registered with the Red Cross to help notify their friends and family.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the World Trade Center, many telephone lines and transmission facilities were disrupted. Computer programmer and science fiction writer William Shunn was in Queens nearby. At about 11:30 a.m. on September 11, in response to a friend's emailed suggestion that he maintain and circulate a list of acquaintances he had heard from thus far, Shunn posted the names of people he knew were okay on his personal web site and began sending the URL to other friends. Keeping the list up-to-date proved difficult, as more emails flooded in than he could handle. He quickly developed a simple database and form submission system so that visitors to the site could post their own names to the list. This automated system debuted at around 1:00 p.m. that afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, a crew of programmers at the University of California, Berkeley with vastly superior resources were working on a similar concept. Their survivor registry went online at about 3:00 p.m. Eastern time. While Shunn's site foundered and eventually crashed under the heavy load of submissions, the Berkeley site ran on a huge computer cluster, and for the next several days stood out as the most robust and accurate of the many survivor registries that followed.\n\nOne problem that plagued the survivor registries was that of inaccurate information. So many entries listed actual victims as being okay that Berkeley eventually implemented a system that used cross-checks to gauge the accuracy of the information received.\n\nThe grassroots generation of survivor registries led many people to wonder why the Federal government did not have such a system already in place. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has since discussed plans for official survivor registries in the future.\n\n"}

{"id": "50027953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50027953", "title": "Vlachs in medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina", "text": "Vlachs in medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nVlachs in Bosnia and Herzegovina are a Balkan tribe who descend from Romanized Illyrians and Thraco-Romans, and other pre-Slavic Romance-speaking peoples. They were semi-nomadic herdsmen, shepherds and farmers. They lived in tents or huts and traded livestock products. Vlach cheese was reputable because of its fat content and fetched high prices. With their caravans, Vlach carried out much of the traffic between inland and coastal cities such as Dubrovnik. Marko Vego argued that Vlach autochthony with Vlach settlements named after Vlach tribes, Vojnići and Hardomilje, are found near Roman forts and monuments. Bogumil Hrabak supported Vego's assertion that the Vlachs preceded both Turks and Bosnian Slavs in Zachlumia. Dominik Mandić argued that some Vlachs from Herzegovina migrated there from Thessaly, Epirus and Macedonia before the Ottoman invasion into Southern Europe. It is argued that some also arrived from the East during the Ottoman wars.\n\nVlachs are first mentioned in Bosnian documents in c. 1234 by ban Matej Ninoslav. Sources from 1361, 1385, 1399, 1406, 1407, 1408 and 1417 among others mention them in relation to Bosnian bans and kings. The relationship of Vlachian \"katuns\" and feudal holdings can be traced from the 14th century. By 1382 they were under the jurisdiction of the Bosnian ruler, to later be assigned to large landowners. The Vlachs and lords relationships indicate that medieval Bosnia was not compact - some Vlach vassals (Gleđević) of the rulers were far from royal lands. Some Vlach vassals (Nenko Krajsalić, Radoslav Borojević) became vassals fairly late although Kosača ruled certain lands near Eastern banks of Neretva river for fifteen years. Some Vlach vassals (Maleš) were partly Pavlović and partly Kosača vassals although working on Kosača holdings.\n\nIn 1382, Vukoslav Piščić was named as \"knez\" of all Vlachs by King Tvrtko I of Bosnia. As the earliest noble landowners, in Herzegovina they were assigned to the Sanković noble family, with \"katun\" Tomić. In 1409, when Tvrtko I conquered parts of Rascia and Zeta they were located around 100 \"katuns\". They were mentioned as \"Vlachorum congregationes et cetus\". In the area around Stolac and Zabljak were so many Vlachs that at the end of the 15th century the territory was as \"Donji Vlasi\" (Lower Vlachs). The \"Gornji Vlasi\" (Upper Vlachs) were only mentioned by Mavro Orbini.\n\nThe 1376 and 1454 documents by Republic of Ragusa about trade with Bosnian lands mention \"Vlachi et Bosgnani\". In the 1418 document by Grgur Nikolić, Vlachs, Serbs and Ragusians are clearly distinguished. In the 14th century documents, they are treated as shepherds from mountains that separate Croatia and Bosnia. It is argued that some group of Vlachs in the 14th century migrated to Zagora and Cetina county in Croatia, followed by the sudden appearance of stećaks in the territory they lived. At a time of social unrest, the Vlachs often fled to the area of Ragusa or Kotor, served in the military of Ragusa during the Ottoman threat, and when most of Herzegovina was occupied by the Ottomans by 1472, once again fled to Ragusan territory.\n\nOttomans in Bosnia and Herzegovina, following the example of \"katuns\", organized \"filurîci eflakan\" (Vlachian filurîci) according to \"Vlach model\" in Smederevo, Vidin and Braničevo. From them was collected tax \"baduhava eflakan\", or \"rusum eflak\", mostly in the form of sheep or goats, as well gold currency. In the defters of the 1470s and 1480s in Central and North-Central Bosnia, around Visoko and Maglaj, roughly 800 Vlachs arrived accompanied by two Orthodox priests. With war and plagues, and as Catholics fled, the repopulation of Bosnia from Herzegovina and Serbia was of high interest for the Ottomans for their military activities. Benedikt Kuripečič in the 16th century noted that Bosnia is inhabited by three peoples; (Muslim) Turks, (Catholic) Bosnians and (Orthodox) Serbs \"who call themselves Vlachs... They came from Smederevo and Belgrade\". Since Vlachs weren't paid for military activity by the Ottomans they were permitted to plunder enemy territory, and became known as martolos or \"voynuk\". Their military activity earned them special tax privileges. In the late 15th century at least 35,000 Vlachs lived in Herzegovina, while in the 16th century 82,692 Vlach households lived in the Smederevo region in Serbia.\n\nLiving on the border of Habsburg Empire they relocated if the social situation was better on the other part of the border. There they received also a special social-militarh system. In 1527 Ferdinand I freed them from feudal obligations, shared booty with them, gave them their own captains (\"vojvoda\"s) and magistrates (\"knez\"es), and freed them to practice Orthodox Christianity. It eventually led to the organisation of the Military Frontier, and the decree \"Statuta Valachorum\" by Ferdinand II. It resulted in a situation almost looking like Vlachs fighting against Vlachs.\n\nIn Southeastern Herzegovina between 1393–1437 many Vlachian \"katuns\" emerged. The primary lords of the Herzegovinian Vlachs were the Kosača, Pavlović, and Nikolić noble families. The Vlachs from Herzegovina sometime plundered lands of Republic of Ragusa in the 14th and 15th century and grew rich by trade of goods between Ragusa and the mines of Bosnia.\n\nVlachs were surnamed Pliščić, Gleđević, Ugarac, Boban, Mirilović, Vragović, Kresojević, Nenković, Bančić, Pilatovac, Pocrnja, Drobnjak and Riđani. Some of the Banjani and Maleševci (Stanković) were Kosača vassals.\n\nVlachs surnamed Vlahović, Žurović, and Predojević, those belonging to the Pribač Nikolić pasture encampment, and some of the Banjan and Maleševac Vlachs (surnamed Hrebeljanović, Milićiević and Milošević) were Pavlovlić vassals.\n\nThe Kutlovići were vassals of the Nikolići. The Primilovići belonged to a larger group of Vlachs, for whom no data on lords were found.\n\nOther \"katun\" Vlachs were Boljuni, Bukvići, Burmazi, Goduni, Hardomilići, Horojevići, Hrabreni, Jurjevići, Kersojevići, Kićurići, Kujavići, Milobradačići, Perventinići, Pribinovići, Rudinjani, Veseličići, Vitkovići, Vojnovići, Vragovići, Zotovići.\n\nVlachs often don't bear \"tribe-katun\" name as a surname, instead using patronymics, for example \"katunar\" Dragić Dobrilović from Boban \"katun\" or \"katunar\"s Klapac Stanković and Radosav Milićević from Maleševac \"katun\".\n\nThe Ottoman occupation conquered Vlachian territories which caused migrations; Ragusan documents in 1386 recorded that some Vlachians with their animals found shelter in Ston and Pelješac (\"...quod recipiantur in Stagno familie, pastores, animalia et carnesia Vlacorum et circum vicinorum propter eorum saluamentum terrore Teucrurum partes discurrentium\"), in 1466 Korita, Banjani and Riđani east of Trebinje fell. In 1448 Ragusa again accepted in Ston and Pelješac \"peasants and Vlachs of duke Stjepan, Radoje Nikolić and Vukašin Grgurević with families and herds, with leaders and shepherds\", as well in 1463 (Vlachs and people from Popovo). During the 15th century they continuously found shelter in the territory of Ragusan Republic, as well Venetian Dalmatia and Bay of Kotor. In 1475–1477 in the nahija Počitelj eleven deserted villages (Gojanovići, Ričica, Kukrica, Opličiča, Plešivac, Svitava, Šanica, Kozica, Gornja Ljubinica, Skočim, Dretelj) were recorded, which were held by the Vlachs. At the time many Vlachs (generally, and from Banjani, Maleševci, Bobani, Zubci) collaborated with Ottomans as slave agents.\n\nThey lived in hamlets called \"katun\" whose chieftain were titled \"katunar\". Around them they placed guards: guard stations were called \"varde\"/\"vardišta\". They were semi-nomadic herdsmen and shepherds, and who became agricultural when settled permanently. They lived in tents or primitive huts. They exported livestock products; animal skin, wool, cheese, butter and dried meat. Other exports included honey and wood. The Vlach cheese was reputable because of fat, and in 1325 sold one libra for 10 folars compared to other cheese that sold for 8 folars. In 1420 Vlach cheese was sold for 15 folars. With their caravans, led by \"kramar\", mostly composed of horses numbering between 10-100, they conducted a large part of the trade between inland and coastal cities. Their military tradition and mobile lifestyle was used by the Bosnian lords and later by the Ottomans. These traits changed very little over the centuries.\n\nThe emergence of the stećaks and their symbolism in Bosnia and Herzegovina by the scholars is often related to Vlachian communities.\n\nVlachs probably were bilingual (speaking Romance and Slavic languages). Many personal names in the records, of which many are preserved, indicate their bilingualism. Initially Vlachs used an Ikavian accent and later I/jekavian accent (speading it further), of Neo-Shtokavian dialect of Serbo-Croatian. Those who migrated to the West during Ottoman invasion spoke what are now labeled Eastern Herzegovinian and Bosnian–Dalmatian subdialects. LZMK linguist Nataša Bašić argued that the Vlachs were creators of New-Shtokavian dialect with reduced number of cases in declination, with New-Shtokavian accent, with the loss of the phoneme /H/, with diphthongization old \"jat\" and other modifications characteristic for foreigners, especially for Romans. Ćiro Truhelka argued that the evasion of the writing and spelling letter /H/ in Serbian language until Karadžić's reform is due to Vlachs influence as it is a Romance language characteristic.\n\nTruhelka noted many preserved non-Slavic family surnames in Bosnia and Herzegovina of Vlachian origin, which are often Slavicized by suffixes \"ić\", \"ović\" and \"ević\", with most notable being; Banjan, Balac, Bilbija, Boban, Bokan, Banduka, Bencun, Belen, Bender, Besara, Bovan, Čokorilo, Darda, Doman, Drečo, Đerman, Gac, Gala, Jarakula, Kalin, Kešelj, Keser, Kočo, Kalaba, Kokoruš, Kosor, Lopar, Macura, Mataruga, Pađen, Palavestra, Punja, Riđan, Šola, Šolaja, Šabat, Šurla, Šatra, Škipina, Špira, Tubin, Taor, Tintor, as well Kecman, Šikman, Toroman, Šuman, Karan, Šurlan, Servan.\n\nPope Gregory XI in 1372 letter for Franciscans in Bosnia ordered them to convert Vlachs who live in tents and pastures (\"Wlachorum... quorum nonnulli in pascuis et tentoriis habitant\"). Their religion depended upon social and political events. During Ottoman occupation the Orthodox Church was more politically favored than Roman Catholic. The first Orthodox churches in Bosnia and Herzegovina were built in the 13th century. With time the Slavicized Vlachs who were of Orthodox faith were Serbianized, while those of Roman Catholic faith were Croatized.\n\n\n\n"}
