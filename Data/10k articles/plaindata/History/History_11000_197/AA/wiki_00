The Third Battalion 1992 tour's codename was \"Operation Gypsy\".\n\nOn 12 May 1992, a unit of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) East Tyrone Brigade launched a bomb attack on a British Army patrol near the republican stronghold of Cappagh, County Tyrone. One soldier of the Parachute Regiment, Alistair Hogdson, lost both legs as a result. The landmine was described in an IRA statement as an \"anti-personnel device\". The incident triggered a rampage by members of the Parachute Regiment in the nearby, overwhelmingly Irish nationalist town of Coalisland, some ten miles to the east. The IRA attack was described as a \"provocation\" tactic, devised to produce an over-reaction by troops to make them even more unpopular among local nationalists.\n\nThe deployment of the paratroopers, which began in April had already been criticised by republican activist and former Member of Parliament Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, who denounced beatings, shootings and damages to property reportedly carried out by the troops. These previous incidents included the destruction of fishing boats and equipments in the townland of Kinturk, near Ardboe. Unionist politician and Ulster Defence Regiment officer Ken Maginnis, then-Member of Parliament for the area, called for the withdrawal of the regiment after receiving a large number of complaints about their behaviour.\n\nTwo hours after the IRA attack, members of the regiment sealed off the town of Coalisland, ten miles east of Cappagh. According to a Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) politician, the soldiers fabricated a bogus bomb warning, while the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) stated that the operation began when a joint police/military patrol was stoned by a crowd. Two pubs were ransacked by the troops and a number of civilian cars were damaged. Several people were allegedly hit with sticks. Following this, a lieutenant was suspended from duty and the regiment was removed from patrol duties in Coalisland.\n\nOn the evening of 17 May, a fist-fight began at Lineside Road, where a group of young men were having a drink. A passing four-man patrol of the King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) regiment was challenged to a 'boxing match' by the residents. The soldiers set aside their weapons and engaged the youths. Injuries were reported on both sides, none critical. The official claim was that the patrol was attacked by a mob of at least 30 people. In the melée, a rifle and a light machine gun were stolen. The rifle was later recovered nearby. The youths smashed a backpack radio which had been left behind by the troops. Two KOSB soldiers were hospitalised.\n\nThe Parachute Regiment was called to the scene again, and at 8:30 PM, a major riot started outside The Rossmore pub between local people and about 20 to 25 paratroopers. The soldiers claimed one of their colleagues was isolated and dragged by the crowd. Some witnesses claimed paratroopers were in a frenzy, showing their guns and inviting civilians to try to take them. Suddenly, shots were fired by the troops —first into the air and then towards the people outside the pub. Three civilians were rushed to hospital in Dungannon with gunshot wounds, while the soldiers returned to their barracks. Another four civilians suffered minor injuries. One of the wounded was the brother of IRA volunteer Kevin O'Donnell, who had been killed by the Special Air Service (SAS) in February during an ambush at the nearby hamlet of Clonoe, shortly after carrying out a machine-gun attack on the local RUC base.\n\nAbout 500 people attended a protest rally in Coalisland on 19 May, and the wisdom of deploying the troops to patrol the town was questioned by members of the Dáil in Dublin. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Ireland, David Andrews, asked the British Government to withdraw the regiment. As a result, the paratroopers were redeployed outside the urban areas. The RUC claimed that the stolen machine gun was found 11 days later at Cappagh, along with another light machine gun and an AK-47 rifle. Republicans questioned whether the weapon had really been stolen, suggesting this was merely an excuse for the soldiers' rampage in Coalisland. British officials accused Sinn Féin of being the instigators of the riots, while Michael Mates, then Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, stated that the incidents were due to \"a gang of thugs motivated by the IRA\". Eventually the battalion's 1992 tour in Northern Ireland was scaled down, with the patrols suspended before the official end of the deployment. The Third Brigade's commander, Brigadier Tom Longland, was replaced by Brigadier Jim Dutton. This was the first occasion that a high-ranking officer was disciplined in such a way during the Troubles.\n\nThe last patrol took place on 27 June, when two paratroopers drowned while crossing the River Blackwater. The same day, there were further clashes with local residents, this time in the town of Cookstown.\n\nSix soldiers faced criminal charges for their roles in the May riots, but were acquitted one year later. Five were bound over. Maurice McHugh, the presiding magistrate, averred that the soldiers were \"not entirely innocent\", while Sinn Féin sources dubbed the ruling \"a farce\". Dungannon priest Father Denis Faul was of the opinion that the soldiers should have been charged with conspiracy. Authors Andrew Sanders and Ian S. Wood suggested that the deployment of the battalion in Coalisland and elsewhere hindered the British policy of police primacy in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n"}

Clashes and subsequent military operations ended with Azerbaijan regaining several occupied villages and strategic positions within the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, these areas had previously been part of a no man's land between the Azerbajiani and Armenian lines. On the end of May, Nakhchivan Separate Combined-arms Army regained control of Gyunnut, a village in Sharur District that has been completely destroyed by the Armenian forces in 1992, and two strategic positions, Khunutdagh and Aghbulag. Azerbaijani Armed Forces also regained control of and took new positions on Kyzylkaya and Mehridagh strategic positions. They also reportedly took new positions in a previously unoccupied neutral zone in Nakhchivan near Armenian village of Areni in Vayots Dzor Province.\n\nArmenia’s Foreign Ministry confirmed and condemned Azerbaijan’s actions at the border as \"unacceptable and irresponsible steps aimed at escalating the situation\". They also said that \"it is regrettable but at the same time very predictable practice of Azerbaijan to exploit any display of goodwill and humanistic approach [from] Armenia for its own propagandistic purposes\". They also warned that \"any provocative action on the Azerbaijani side will be immediately stopped and will trigger the adequate response from the Armenian side\".\n\nOne soldier of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces, and at least three soldiers of the Armenian Armed Forces were reported KIA during the military operations.\n\nArmenian forces seized control of Gyunnyut, which is located Sharur District of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, in 1992.\n\nOn 16 May 2018 Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev visited the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. He stated that Nakhchivan branch of the Azerbaijani Army possessed missiles which could easily reach Armenia's capital, Yerevan. Two days later, on 17 May Armenia's new Minister of Defence and Foreign Affairs visited the Armenian–Nakhchivan border to inspect military positions.\n\nAccording to some Azerbaijani military bloggers and news sites, Azerbaijani positions in the Sharur District of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic became exposed to artillery fire of the Armenian Armed Forces.\n\nOn next day, Azerbaijani Army concluded that a counter-attack is necessary. With an order of the Defence Minister Zakir Hasanov, Nakhchivan Separate Combined-arms Army launched an offensive operation near Gyunnyut. In result, according to Azerbaijani media, Azerbaijan regained 110 or 10 km² of land.\n\nGyunnyut clashes were the largest military confrontation on the line of contact between the Armenian and Azerbaijani troops since April War that ended on 5 April 2016. There are various speculations about the beginning of the operation. Azerbaijani military experts accused Armenia of planning an attack on Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.\n\nOn 8 June 2018 Azerbaijani Government announced that they started to build a new road that would be 50 km long. They also started to rebuild the roads that were destroyed during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Azerbaijani Armed Forces have taken up new positions in strategic locations.\n\nOn 20 May 2018 Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Defence reported the death of infantryman Adil Tatarov who died while \"carrying out an official assignment on the border of [Nakhchivan] and Armenia\". The Armenian side stated that the corresponding Azerbaijani soldier had advanced towards the border. In response the Defence Ministry of Armenia accused Azerbaijan of breaking the ceasefire and said that \"in recent weeks, at certain sections of the Armenian-Azerbaijani border Azerbaijani forces are conducting active engineering works to improve and move forward their positions\". Nevertheless, on 6 June Adil Tatarov received the \"For Courage\" Medal with an order of Defense Minister of Azerbaijan, colonel-general Zakir Hasanov.\n\nMany Azerbaijani news sites reported that Armenian Armed Forces lost more than 7 military personnel during the operations, but these claims have not been confirmed neither by Azerbaijan or Armenia.\n\nAzerbaijani Ministry of Defence claimed that three Armenian soldiers were killed during the operation. Armenian Ministry of Defence confirmed the death of Martin Khachatryan, but denied the claims of Hamlet Grigoryan getting killed in Northern Nakhchivan. They reported that he committed suicide in Eastern parts of de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Armenian Ministry of Defence have said nothing about alleged death of Hakop Hakopyan.\n"}

In 1944, he graduated from Shusha's Pedagogical Institute. Two years later, he received his degrees in Armenian language and Armenian literature from Baku's Pedagogical Institute. From 1949 until 1967, he returned to Nagorno-Karabakh and was the head of the province's Writers Union. During those years, he was also a writer for the Armenian language newspaper \"Sovetakan Gharabagh\" (\"Soviet Karabakh\") and a deputy to the head of NKAO's executive committee. In 1968, Ulubabyan moved from the NKAO to Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian SSR, and in the following year, became a senior researcher in the history department at the Armenian Academy of Sciences.\n\nUlubabyan's first works were in the field of poetry. In 1952 and 1956, he completed two works, \"Songs about Work and Peace\" and \"This Morning\". He, however, shifted his focus and began writing short stories as well as epics: \"Aygestan\" (1960), \"Tartar\" (1963), \"The Grain Never Dies\" (1967), and \"Lamp\" (1976). He also wrote two novels, \"Armenian Land\" in 1959 and \"The Man\" in 1963. One of his most prominent works was the historical novel \"Sardarapat\".\n\nMany of Ulubabyan's work concern the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1975, he published \"The Principality of Khachen, From the 10th to 16th centuries\", a political and cultural history of the medieval principality of Khachen. In 1979, he published \"A Gold Chain\", a collection of historical essays from the stories of Movses Kaghankatvatsi until the era of the principalities of Karabakh, depicting the role of Nagorno-Karabakh in the history of Armenia. Several years later, in 1981, he published \"Studies in the History of the Eastern Provinces of Armenia\" and \"Gandzasar\". More recently, he authored \"A History of Artsakh: From the Beginning Until Our Days\" (1994). Another work on the region, \"The Survival Struggle of Artsakh\", was published in the same year and was a study focusing on the Nagorno-Karabakh during the Soviet era (from 1918 until the 1960s). As an expert in Classical Armenian literature, he translated two works of the 5th-century Armenian chronicler Ghazar Parpetsi, \"A History of Armenia\" and \"A Letter to Vahan Mamikonian\", into Armenian in 1982.\n\nIn the late 1980s, with the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Ulubabyan took part in the demonstrations in Yerevan which called on Soviet authorities to turn Karabakh over to the control of Armenia. During the 1960s, Ulubabyan had also been the author and one of thirteen signatories of a letter sent to Moscow, asking that the Soviet Union to consider Karabakh's incorporation into Armenia.\n\nOn May 7, 2001, in honor of his work in regards to Armenian history, he was decorated with the Order of Saint Gregory the Illuminator by the Nagorno Karabakh Republic's then-president, Arkady Ghukasyan. After suffering from a long bout of lung disease, Ulubabyan died on November 19, 2001.\n\nIn modern academic world Bagrat Ulubabyan is acknowledged as a respected scholar in the field of Caucasiology. Western scholars, such as Robert Hewsen or Patrick Donabedian, have extensively used Ulubabyan's research on eastern lands of Armenia, directly or indirectly endorsing his statements and views. In an essay on the kingdom of Artsakh, Hewsen also referred to Ulubabyan's \"Principality of Khachen\" as an \"important work\" and suggested it as a supplemental source to readers who are interested in learning more about the region and its medieval history.\n\nHowever, Russian historian Victor Schnirelmann considers Ulubabyan as one of several scholars who tried to create an Armenian \"myth\" of the history of Nagorno-Karabakh. Schnirelmann criticized Ulubabyans contention that in the early Middle Ages the Caucasian Albanians populated only the lands to the north of the Kura River, and that despite the traditional point of view according to which the Udi people represent the descendants of medieval Albanian tribe of Utis, Ulubabyan claimed that the latter were not only Armenicized very early, but were almost originally Armenian.\n"}

{"id": "740634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=740634", "title": "Benedetto Croce", "text": "Benedetto Croce\n\nBenedetto Croce (; ; 25 February 1866 – 20 November 1952) was an Italian idealist philosopher, historian and politician, who wrote on numerous topics, including philosophy, history, historiography and aesthetics. In most regards, Croce was a liberal, although he opposed \"laissez-faire\" free trade and had considerable influence on other Italian intellectuals, including both Marxist Antonio Gramsci and fascist Giovanni Gentile. Croce was President of PEN International, the worldwide writers' association, from 1949 until 1952. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature sixteen times.\n\nCroce was born in Pescasseroli in the Abruzzo region of Italy. His family was influential and wealthy, and he was raised in a very strict Catholic environment. Around the age of 16, he quit Catholicism and developed a personal philosophy of spiritual life, in which religion cannot be anything but a historical institution where the creative strength of mankind can be expressed. He kept this philosophy for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1883, an earthquake occurred in the village of Casamicciola on the island of Ischia near Naples, where he was on holiday with his family, destroying the home they lived in. His mother, father, and only sister were all killed, while he was buried for a long time and barely survived. After the earthquake he inherited his family's fortune and—much like Schopenhauer—was able to live the rest of his life in relative leisure, devoting a great deal of time to philosophy as an independent intellectual writing from his palazzo in Naples (Ryn, 2000:xi).\n\nHe studied law, but never graduated, at the University of Naples, while reading extensively on historical materialism. His ideas were publicized at the University of Rome towards the end of the 1890s by Professor Antonio Labriola. Croce was well acquainted with and sympathetic to the developments in European socialist philosophy exemplified by August Bebel, Friedrich Engels, Karl Kautsky, Paul Lafargue, Wilhelm Liebknecht, and Filippo Turati.\n\nInfluenced by Neapolitan-born Gianbattista Vico's thoughts about art and history, he began studying philosophy in 1893. Croce also purchased the house in which Vico had lived. His friend, the philosopher Giovanni Gentile, encouraged him to read Hegel. Croce's famous commentary on Hegel, \"What is Living and What is Dead in the Philosophy of Hegel\", was published in 1907.\n\nAs his fame increased, Croce was persuaded, against his initial wishes, to become involved with politics. He was appointed to the Italian Senate, a lifelong position, in 1910 (Ryn, 2000:xi). He was an open critic of Italy's participation in World War I, feeling that it was a suicidal trade war. Though this made him initially unpopular, his reputation was restored after the war. In 1919, he supported the government of Francesco Saverio Nitti while also expressing his admiration for the nascent Weimar Republic and the German Social Democrats. He was Minister of Public Education between 1920 and 1921 for the 5th and last government headed by Giovanni Giolitti. Benito Mussolini assumed power slightly more than a year after Croce's exit from the government; Mussolini's first Minister of Public Education was Giovanni Gentile, an independent who later became a fascist and with whom Croce had earlier cooperated in a philosophical polemic against positivism. Gentile remained minister for only a year but managed to begin a comprehensive reform of Italian education that was based partly on Croce's earlier suggestions. Gentile's reform remained in force well beyond the Fascist regime, and was only partly abolished in 1962.\n\nCroce was instrumental in the relocation of the Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III to Naples' Palazzo Reale in 1923.\n\nCroce initially supported Mussolini's Fascist government that took power in 1922. However, the assassination by Fascists of the socialist politician Giacomo Matteotti in June 1924 shook Croce's support for Mussolini. In May 1925 Croce was one of the signatories to the Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals which had been written by Croce himself; however, in June of the previous year, he had voted in the Senate in support of the Mussolini government. He later explained that he had hoped that the support for Mussolini in parliament would weaken the more extreme Fascists who, he believed, were responsible for Matteotti's murder.\n\nIn 1928, Croce voted against the law which effectively abolished free elections in Italy by requiring electors to vote for a list of candidates approved by the Grand Council of Fascism. He became increasingly dismayed by the number of ex-democrats who had abandoned their former principles. Croce frequently provided financial assistance to anti-Fascist writers and dissidents such as Giorgio Amendola, Ivanoe Bonomi, and Meuccio Ruini, as well as those who wanted to maintain intellectual and political independence from the regime, and covertly helped them get published. Croce's house in Turin became a popular destination for anti-Fascists, and after the war, Amendola along with communists such as Eugenio Reale reflected that Croce offered aid and encouragement to both liberal and Marxist resistance members during the crucial years. \n\nCroce was seriously threatened by Mussolini's regime, though the only act of physical violence he suffered at the hands of the fascists was the ransacking of his home and library in Naples in November 1926. Although he managed to stay outside prison thanks to his reputation, he remained subject to surveillance, and his academic work was kept in obscurity by the government, to the extent that no mainstream newspaper or academic publication ever referred to him. Croce later coined the term \"onagrocrazia\" (literally \"government by asses\") to emphasize the anti-intellectual and boorish tendencies of parts of the Fascist regime. However, in describing Fascism as anti-intellectual Croce ignored the many Italian intellectuals who at the time actively supported Mussolini's regime, including Croce's former friend and colleague, Gentile. Croce also described Fascism as \"malattia morale\" (literally \"moral illness\"). When Mussolini's government adopted antisemitic policies in 1938, Croce was the only non-Jewish intellectual who refused to complete a government questionnaire designed to collect information on the so-called \"racial background\" of Italian intellectuals.\n\nIn 1944, when democracy was restored in Southern Italy, Croce, as an \"icon of liberal anti-fascism\", became minister without portfolio in governments headed by Pietro Badoglio and by Ivanoe Bonomi (Ryn, 2000:xi–xii). He left the government in July 1944 but remained president of the Liberal Party until 1947 (Ryn, 2000:xii).\n\nCroce voted for the Monarchy in the Constitutional referendum of June 1946, after having persuaded his Liberal party to adopt a neutral stance. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly which existed in Italy between June 1946 and January 1948. He spoke in the Assembly against the Peace treaty (signed in February 1947), which he regarded as humiliating for Italy. He declined to stand as provisional President of Italy.\n\nCroce's most interesting philosophical ideas are expounded in three works: \"Aesthetic\" (1902), \"Logic\" (1908), and \"Philosophy of the Practical\" (1908), but his complete work is spread over 80 books and 40 years worth of publications in his own bimonthly literary magazine, \"La Critica\" (Ryn, 2000:xi) Croce was philosophically a pantheist, but, from a religious point of view, an agnostic; however, he did publish an essay entitled \"Why We Cannot Help Calling Ourselves Christians\". This essay shows the Christian roots of European culture, but religion is considered by Croce a mere propaedeutic study for philosophy, which is the only true science: philosophy is in fact the science of spirit (the \"Philosophy of Spirit\").\n\nHeavily influenced by Hegel and other German Idealists such as Schelling, Croce produced what was called, by him, the Philosophy of Spirit. His preferred designations were \"absolute idealism\" or \"absolute historicism\". Croce's work can be seen as a second attempt (contra Kant) to resolve the problems and conflicts between empiricism and rationalism (or sensationalism and transcendentalism, respectively). He calls his way \"immanentism\", and concentrates on the lived human experience, as it happens in specific places and times. Since the root of reality is this immanent existence in concrete experience, Croce places aesthetics at the foundation of his philosophy.\n\nCroce's methodological approach to philosophy is expressed in his divisions of the spirit, or mind. He divides mental activity first into the theoretical, and then the practical. The theoretical division splits between aesthetic and logic. This theoretical aesthetic includes most importantly: intuitions and history. The logical includes concepts and relations. Practical spirit is concerned with economics and ethics. Economics is here to be understood as an exhaustive term for all utilitarian matters.\n\nEach of these divisions have an underlying structure that colors, or dictates, the sort of thinking that goes on within them. While Aesthetic is driven by beauty, Logic is subject to truth, Economics is concerned with what is useful, and the moral, or Ethics, is bound to the good. This schema is descriptive in that it attempts to elucidate the logic of human thought; however, it is prescriptive as well, in that these ideas form the basis for epistemological claims and confidence.\n\nCroce also had great esteem for Vico, and shared his opinion that history should be written by philosophers. Croce's \"On History\" sets forth the view of history as \"philosophy in motion\", that there is no \"cosmic design\" or ultimate plan in history, and that the \"science of history\" was a farce.\n\nCroce's work \"Breviario di estetica\" (\"The Essence of Aesthetics\") appears in the form of four lessons (\"quattro lezioni\") in aesthetics that he was asked to write and deliver at the inauguration of Rice University in 1912. He declined an invitation to attend the event, but he wrote the lessons and submitted them for translation so that they could be read in his absence.\n\nIn this brief, but dense, work, Croce sets forth his theory of art. He believed that art is more important than science or metaphysics since only art edifies us. He claimed that all we know can be reduced to imaginative knowledge. Art springs from the latter, making it at its heart, pure imagery. All thought is based in part on this, and it precedes all other thought. The task of an artist is then to invent the perfect image that they can produce for their viewer since this is what beauty fundamentally is – the formation of inward, mental images in their ideal state. Our intuition is the basis for forming these concepts within us.\n\nCroce was the first to develop a position later known as aesthetic expressivism, the idea that art expresses emotions, not ideas. (R. G. Collingwood later developed a similar thesis.)\n\nCroce's theory was later debated by such contemporary Italian philosophers as Umberto Eco, who locates the aesthetic within a semiotic construction.\n\nCroce's liberalism differs from the theories advocated by most proponents of liberal political thought, including those in Britain and in the United States of America: while Croce theorises that the individual is the basis of society, he rejects social atomism, and while Croce accepts limited government, he disputes the idea that the government should have fixed legitimate powers.\n\nCroce did not agree with John Locke about the nature of liberty. Croce believed that liberty is not a natural right but an earned right that arises out of continuing historical struggle for its maintenance.\n\nCroce defined civilization as the \"continual vigilance\" against barbarism, and liberty conformed to his ideal for civilization as it allows one to experience the full potential of life.\n\nCroce also rejects egalitarianism as absurd. In short, his variety of liberalism is aristocratic, as he views society being led by the few who can create the goodness of truth, civilization, and beauty, with the great mass of citizens, simply benefiting from them but unable to fully comprehend their creations (Ryn, 2000:xii).\n\nIn \"Etica e politica\" (1931), Croce defines liberalism as an ethical conception of life that rejects dogmatism and favors diversity, and in the name of liberty and free choice of the individual, is hostile to the authoritarianism of fascism, communism, and the Catholic Church. While Croce realizes that democracy can sometimes threaten individual liberty, he sees liberalism and democracy as predicated on the same ideals of moral equality and opposition to authority. Furthermore, he acknowledged the positive historic role played by the Socialist parties in Italy in their struggles to improve conditions for the working class, and urged modern socialists to swear off dictatorial solutions. In contrast to the socialists, who Croce viewed as part of modernity along with liberals, his condemnation of reactionaries is unremittingly harsh. \n\nCroce also draws a distinction between liberalism and capitalism or \"laissez-faire\" economic doctrines. For Croce, capitalism only emerged to meet certain economic needs of society, and could be changed or even replaced if better solutions to those needs were found, if it failed to promote freedom, or if economic values clashed with higher values. Thus liberalism could welcome socialistic proposals so long as they promoted freedom. Croce's ideas on the separation between liberalism as an ethical principle and the contingent \"laissez-faire\" economic doctrines which accompanied it in certain contexts would influence Italian social democrats such as Leo Valiani and Giuseppe Saragat as well as the liberal socialist synthesis of Carlo Rosselli.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As Marshal of the Sejm (Speaker of the lower house of Parliament), Komorowski exercised the powers and duties of head of state following the death of President Lech Kaczyński in a plane crash on 10 April 2010. Komorowski was then the governing Civic Platform party's candidate in the resulting presidential election, which he won in the second round of voting on 4 July 2010. He was sworn in as President on 6 August 2010. Komorowski thus became the second person to serve on two occasions as Polish head of state since 1918, after Maciej Rataj. \nOn 25 May 2015, Komorowski conceded the presidency of Poland to the rival candidate Andrzej Duda, after the latter won the second round of the 2015 presidential election.\n\nBronisław Maria Komorowski was born in Oborniki Śląskie. Born as a son of Zygmunt Leon Komorowski (1925–1992), professor of African Studies at the University of Warsaw and Jadwiga Komorowska (née Szalkowska) .\n\nFrom 1957 to 1959 he lived in Józefów near Otwock. From 1959 to 1966 he also attended elementary school in Pruszków. In 1966 he transferred to Warsaw and graduated from Cyprian Kamil Norwid High School no. 24. For many years he was affiliated with the Scout Movement. During his studies he was a Scout instructor in 208 WDHiZ \"Parasol\" Battalion in Mokotów. He met his future wife through Scouting.\n\nIn 1977 he finished his studies in history at the University of Warsaw. From 1977 to 1980 he was an editor at the journal \"Słowo Powszechne\".\n\nIn the People's Republic of Poland, Komorowski took part in the democratic movement as an underground publisher and co-operated with Antoni Macierewicz on the monthly Głos. In 1980, he was sentenced along with activists of the Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights to one month in prison for organizing a demonstration on 11 November 1979 (the judge who presided the trial was Andrzej Kryże). From 1980 to 1981, he worked in the Centre of Social Investigation of NSZZ \"Solidarity\". On 27 September 1981, he was one of the signatories of the founding declaration of the Clubs in the Service of Independence. He was interned while Poland was under martial law. From 1981 to 1989, he taught at the Lower Seminary in Niepokalanów.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1990, he was the manager minister Aleksander Hall's office, and from 1990 to 1993, the civil vice minister of national defence in the governments of Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Jan Krzysztof Bielecki and Hanna Suchocka. In the early 1990s he was involved with the Democratic Union and Freedom Union. From 1993 to 1995, he was the general secretary of these parties.\nAs a candidate of the Democratic Union he was elected to parliament in 1991 and in 1993. In 1997, during the 2nd Sejm, together with a group of Warsaw University activists under the management of Jan Rokita he created Koło Konserwatywno-Ludowe. In the same year Koło Konserwatywno-Ludowe joined the newly created Conservative People's Party (SKL), which joined Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS). In September 1997 Komorowski was elected as a candidate of AWS. From 1997 to 2000 he presided over the Parliamentary National Defence Committee, and from 2000 to 2001 served as the minister of national defence in the government of Jerzy Buzek. In 2001, while still a minister in the minority AWS government, Komorowski, along with some activists from SKL, became a member of Civic Platform (PO). He stood for election to the 4th Sejm as a candidate of PO. Again he was elected, this time for the Warsaw constituency. After the inauguration of the new parliament he resigned from SKL. Since 2001 he has been a member of the National Civic Platform Board. In the 4th Sejm he was the deputy chairman of the Parliamentary National Defence Committee and a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n\nHe won election to the 5th Sejm in a district outside Warsaw. On 26 October 2005, he was elected Vice Speaker of the Sejm. 398 MPs voted in favour of his candidacy. His party had earlier recommended him as a candidate for Speaker. His candidacy, in defiance of precedent, was rejected by Law and Justice (PiS) which voted for Marek Jurek. This created an unfavourable climate further discussions regarding a PO-PiS coalition.\n\nAfter the resignation of Marek Jurek as Speaker of the Sejm on 25 April 2007 Civic Platform announced Komorowski's candidacy for Speaker. On 27 April 2007 the Sejm rejected his nomination, and Ludwik Dorn from PiS became a new marshal. 189 MPs voted for Komorowski. Komorowski became Vice Speaker.\n\nKomorowski took first place on the PO list for the Warsaw constituency in the 2007 parliamentary election and received 139,320 votes.\n\nOn 5 November 2007, in the first session of the 4th Sejm of the Polish Republic Bronisław Komorowski was elected Speaker by 292 votes. He stood against Krzysztof Putra from PiS who received 160 votes. Stefan Niesiołowski, Krzysztof Putra, Jarosław Kalinowski, Jerzy Szmajdziński were elected Vice Speakers.\n\nOn 27 March 2010, he was chosen by PO members to be their candidate in 2010 presidential election.\n\nKomorowski became acting president on 10 April 2010 following the death of President Lech Kaczyński. His first decision was to announce seven days of national mourning beginning on 10 April. According to the Constitution of Poland, Komorowski was required to set a date for the next presidential election within 14 days of assuming the position, the election date coming within 60 days of that announcement. On 21 April, his office announced that the election would be held on 20 June. In the election, he got 41.54% of votes in the first round and then faced Jarosław Kaczyński, who got 36.46% of votes in the first round.\n\nIn the runoff Komorowski was elected president (8 933 887 valid votes, 53,01%) and formally took office on 6 August 2010.\n\nFollowing the death of Władysław Stasiak, the chief of the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland, Komorowski appointed Jacek Michałowski to succeed him on an acting basis. A high number of vacancies following the Smolensk crash necessitated numerous other appointments. On 12 April, he appointed retired General Stanisław Koziej head of the National Security Bureau in place of the late Aleksander Szczygło.\n\nOn 29 April 2010, Komorowski signed into law a parliamentary act that reformed the Institute of National Remembrance.\n\nOn 27 May 2010, Komorowski nominated Marek Belka, former Finance Minister and Prime Minister (2004–2005) of a then-leftist government, to be the president of the National Bank of Poland in place of the late Sławomir Skrzypek.\n\nFollowing his election, Komorowski announced that he would resign from the Sejm on 8 July 2010, and thus cease to be a marshal and an acting president (his successor as an acting president was the next marshal of the Sejm Grzegorz Schetyna, who held the position for about a month before Komorowski's formal inauguration). Komorowski currently resides and works in the Belweder Palace instead of the Presidential Palace.\n\nOn 25 May 2015, following his defeat in the second round of the 2015 presidential election, Komorowski conceded the presidency to rival Andrzej Duda, after the latter won a 51.5% majority. This was the tightest election of Polish history. His term ended on 6 August 2015, when Duda was sworn in as a new president.\n\nKomorowski has been married to Anna Dembowska since 1977. The couple has five children: Zofia Aleksandra (born 1979), Tadeusz Jan (born 1981), Maria Anna (born 1983), Piotr Zygmunt (born 1986) and Elżbieta Jadwiga (born 1989).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "83987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83987", "title": "Camp (style)", "text": "Camp (style)\n\nCamp is an aesthetic style and sensibility that regards something as appealing because of its bad taste and ironic value. Camp aesthetics disrupt many of modernism's notions of what art is and what can be classified as high art by inverting aesthetic attributes such as beauty, value, and taste through an invitation of a different kind of apprehension and consumption.\n\nCamp can also be a social practice. For many it is considered a style and performance identity for several types of entertainment including film, cabaret, and pantomime. Where high art necessarily incorporates beauty and value, camp necessarily needs to be lively, audacious and dynamic. \"Camp aesthetics delights in impertinence.\" Camp opposes satisfaction and seeks to challenge.\n\nCamp art is related to—and often confused with—kitsch, and things with camp appeal may also be described as \"cheesy\". When the usage appeared in 1909, it denoted \"ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical\", or \"effeminate\" behaviour, and by the middle of the 1970s, the definition comprised \"banality, mediocrity, artifice, [and] ostentation ... so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal\". The American writer Susan Sontag's essay \"Notes on 'Camp'\" (1964) emphasized its key elements as: artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and 'shocking' \"excess\". Camp as an aesthetic has been popular from the 1960s to the present.\n\nCamp aesthetics were popularized by filmmakers George and Mike Kuchar, Jack Smith and his film \"Flaming Creatures\", and later John Waters, including the last's \"Pink Flamingos\", \"Hairspray\", and \"Polyester\". Celebrities that are associated with camp personas include drag queens and performers such as Dame Edna Everage, Divine, RuPaul, Paul Lynde, and Liberace. Camp was a part of the anti-academic defence of popular culture in the 1960s and gained popularity in the 1980s with the widespread adoption of postmodern views on art and culture. Television programs as varied as \"Doctor Who\", \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", and \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\" have been described as camp.\n\nIn 1909, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" gave the first print citation of \"camp\" as\n\nAccording to the dictionary, this sense is \"etymologically obscure\". \"Camp\" in this sense has been suggested to have possibly derived from the French term \"se camper\", meaning \"to pose in an exaggerated fashion\". Later, it evolved into a general description of the aesthetic choices and behaviour of working-class homosexual men. Finally, it was made mainstream, and adjectivized, by Susan Sontag in a landmark essay (see below).\n\nThe rise of post-modernism made \"camp\" a common perspective on aesthetics, which was not identified with any specific group. The attitude was originally a distinctive factor in pre-Stonewall gay male communities, where it was the dominant cultural pattern. It originated from the acceptance of gayness as effeminacy. Two key components of camp were originally feminine performances: swish and drag. With swish featuring extensive use of superlatives, and drag being exaggerated female impersonation, camp became extended to all things \"over the top\", including women posing as female impersonators (faux queens), as in the exaggerated Hollywood version of Carmen Miranda. It was this version of the concept that was adopted by literary and art critics and became a part of the conceptual array of 1960s culture. Moe Meyer still defines \"camp\" as \"queer parody\".\n\nMuch of the cult following of camp today grew rapidly during the transition from black-and-white to colour television in the early 1960s. Network programming during that time sought entertainment content that would display the new medium with the use of bright colours and high stylization. The concept of the comicbook superhero (an individual in a highly stylized, outlandish and possibly impractical costume avenging otherwise serious matters such as murder) could be interpreted as camp. However, since it was aimed initially at children, it is camp only in a secondary perspective. It was not until the 1960s television version of \"Batman\" (one of the more famous examples of camp in popular culture, 1966–1968) that the link was made explicit, with the inherent ridiculousness of the concept exposed as a vehicle for comedy. The villains of series as divergent as \"Batman\" and \"The Mod Squad\" (1968–1973) were costumed as to take advantage of new colours and changing fashion styles, in ways that took advantage of camp. \n\nIronically, even \"Batman\" fell victim to contemporaneous parodies, with the release of \"Captain Nice\" and \"Mr. Terrific\", which layered extra camp onto the already overladen superhero concept. The stylized content of \"Batman\" may have possibly jump-started television campiness, to circumvent the strict censorship of comics at this time (after Dr. Fredric Wertham's essay \"Seduction of the Innocent\" which led to the comics' industry-sponsored Comics Code), as the \"Batman\" comic books were very dark and noirish until the 1950s and from the 1970s onwards.\n\nTelevision series such as \"The Avengers\" (1961–1969), \"The Addams Family\", \"The Munsters\" (both 1964–1966), \"Gilligan's Island\" (1964–1967), \"Lost in Space\" (1965–1968), \"The Wild Wild West\" (1965–1969), \"Get Smart\" (1965–1970), \"Are You Being Served?\" (1972–1985), \"Charlie's Angels\" (1976–1981), \"Fantasy Island\" (1977–1984) and \"CHiPs\" (1977–1983) are enjoyed into the 21st century for what are interpreted as their \"camp\" aspects. Some of these series were developed 'tongue-in-cheek' by their producers.\n\nIn a \"Monty Python\" sketch of their television show (Episode 22, \"Camp Square-Bashing\", repeated in their film \"And Now for Something Completely Different\", 1971), the British Army's 2nd Armoured Division has a Military \"Swanning About\" Precision Drill unit in which soldiers \"camp it up\" in unison.\n\nTV soap operas, especially those that air in primetime, are often considered camp. The over-the-top excess of \"Dallas\" (1978–1991) and \"Dynasty\" (1981–1989) were popular in the 1980s. The Channel 4 series \"Eurotrash\" (1993–2004) was a television programme produced using the inherent ridiculousness of its subject matter for comedic effect, often using camp dubbing in regional accents and overexaggerated stereotypical characterisations (such as an aristocratic artist based on Brian Sewell) to puncture the interviewees' pretence of seriousness. However, an obituary to Lolo Ferrari was given straight dubbing as a mark of respect at odds with its irreverence. However, the subject matter would have offended many British viewers and fallen foul of OFCOM if it was done with any seriousness. Again, this is an example of doing a programme in a camp manner to get around the likelihood of censorship. Mentos television commercials during the 1990s developed a cult following due to their camp \"Eurotrash\" humour. In the Season 8 episode \"Homer's Phobia\" (1997) of the American animated comedy series \"The Simpsons\", gay secondary character John (played by gay director John Waters) defines to Homer Simpson the meaning of the word \"camp\" to be \"tragically ludicrous\", or \"ludicrously tragic\": Homer gives a misinterpreted example of \"camp\" as \"when a clown dies\".\n\nThe Comedy Central television show \"Strangers with Candy\" (1999–2000), starring comedian Amy Sedaris, was a camp spoof of the \"ABC Afterschool Special\" genre. The ESPN Classic show \"Cheap Seats without Ron Parker\" (2004–2006) featured two Generation-X, real-life brothers making humorous observations while watching televised camp sporting events, which had often been featured on \"ABC's Wide World of Sports\" during the 1970s. Examples include a 1970s sport that attempted to combine ballet with skiing (ski ballet), the Harlem Globetrotters holding a televised exhibition game at the notorious Attica State Prison in upstate New York, small-time regional professional wrestling and roller derby. The television series \"Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\" (2007–2010) is a current example of camp, using inspiration from Public-access television productions, early morning infomercials, and the use of celebrity status in telethons and other televised charity appeals.\n\nSome classic films noted for their camp tone include:\n\nFilms such as \"Valley of the Dolls\" (1967), \"Mommie Dearest\" (1981), \"Showgirls\" (1995), and \"Burlesque\" (2010) gained camp status primarily due to the filmmakers' attempting to produce a serious film that wound up unintentionally comedic. Award-winning actresses, like Patty Duke in \"Valley of the Dolls\" and Faye Dunaway in \"Mommie Dearest\", gave such over-the-top performances that the films became camp classics, especially attracting fanfare from gay, male audiences.\n\nThe second part of the 1978 movie \"Superman\" set in fictional Metropolis takes on a campy screwball tone after the seriousness of the origin story.\n\nEducational and industrial films form an entire subgenre of camp films, with the most famous being the much-spoofed 1950s \"Duck and Cover\" film, in which an anthropomorphic, cartoon turtle explains how one can survive a nuclear attack by hiding under a school desk. Its British counterpart \"Protect and Survive\" could be seen as kitsch, even though it is very chilling to watch (it was never shown on grounds of national security and would only be broadcast if an attack was deemed likely within 72 hours). Many British Public Information Films gained a camp cult following, such as the famous Charley Says series. Charley's voice is performed by the camp surrealist comedian and Radio DJ Kenny Everett, who came from an advertising background as a copywriter.\n\nSome films are intentionally and consciously camp, such as \"The Toxic Avenger\" (1984) and \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" (1994). Quentin Tarantino's black comedy crime film \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) has also fallen into this category, with film critic Nicholas Christopher calling it \"more gangland Camp than neo-noir\". In British cinema the archetypal camp film cult is the outrageous long-running, 30-film \"Carry On\" series (1958–1978). Another cult is built around \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975). \"Preaching to the Perverted\" (1997), written and directed by Stuart Urban, broke out of traditional British comedy style to portray the fetish and BDSM scene under assault from Christian crusaders and the authorities. It portrayed both the fetish scene and the Establishment in a cartoon, stylized visual manner. Lambasted by most traditional critics, lauded by gay, music and fashion press, it went on to build a lasting cult reputation.\n\nMovie versions of camp TV shows in recent years have made the camp nature of these shows a running gag throughout the films. In \"Grizzly Man\" (2005), a documentary by Werner Herzog, the protagonist, Timothy Treadwell, describes the wild life of bears with camp mannerisms. Inspired by the work of George Kuchar and his brother Mike Kuchar, ASS Studios, launched in 2011 by Courtney Fathom Sell and Jen Miller, began making a series of short, no-budget camp films. Their feature film \"Satan, Hold My Hand\" (2013) features many elements recognized in camp pictures.\n\nAmerican singer and actress Cher is often called the \"Queen of Camp\" due to her outrageous fashion and live performances. She gained that status in the 1970s when she was heavily present on American prime time television with her variety shows on which she was collaborating with the famous costume designer Bob Mackie.\n\nDusty Springfield is a camp icon. In public and on stage, Springfield developed a joyful image supported by her peroxide blonde beehive hairstyle, evening gowns, and heavy make-up that included her much-copied \"panda eye\" mascara. Springfield borrowed elements of her look from blonde glamour queens of the 1950s, such as Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve, and pasted them together according to her own taste. Her ultra-glamorous look made her a camp icon and this, combined with her emotive vocal performances, won her a powerful and enduring following in the gay community. Besides the prototypical female drag queen, she was presented in the roles of the \"Great White Lady\" of pop and soul and the \"Queen of Mods\". More recently South Korean rapper Psy known for his viral internet music videos full of flamboyant dance and visuals has come to be seen as a 21st-century incarnation of camp style.\n\nSome challenge the perceived 'whiteness' of camp aesthetics, noting barriers for gender exploration in queer black communities relative to white LGBT communities. Uri McMillan identifies Nicki Minaj as a contemporary black icon of camp.\n\nRetro-camp fashion is an example of modern hipsters employing camp styles for the sake of humour. Yard decorations, popular in some parts of suburban and rural America, are examples of kitsch and are sometimes displayed as camp expressions. The classic camp yard ornament is the pink plastic flamingo. The yard globe, garden gnome, wooden cut-out of a fat lady bending over, the statue of a small black man holding a lantern (called a lawn jockey) and ceramic statues of white-tailed deer are also prevalent camp lawn decorations.\n\nThe Carvel chain of soft-serve ice cream stores is famous for its camp style, camp low-budget TV commercials and camp ice-cream cakes such as Cookie Puss and Fudgie The Whale.\n\nThe words \"camp\" and \"kitsch\" are often used interchangeably; both may relate to art, literature, music, or any object that carries an aesthetic value. However, \"kitsch\" refers specifically to the work itself, whereas \"camp\" is a mode of performance. Thus, a person may consume kitsch intentionally or unintentionally. Camp, as Susan Sontag observed, is always a way of consuming or performing culture \"in quotation marks.\"\n\nHowever, Sontag also distinguishes the difference between \"naive\" and \"deliberate\" camp. Kitsch, as a form or style, certainly falls under the category \"naive camp\" as it is unaware that it is tasteless; \"deliberate camp\", on the other hand, can be seen as a subversive form of kitsch which deliberately exploits the whole notions of what it is to be kitsch. (Sontag, 1964)\n\nThomas Hine identified 1954–1964 as the campiest period in modern US history. During this time, Americans had more money to spend, thanks to the post-war economic boom; but they often exercised poor taste. In the UK, on the other hand, camp is an adjective, often associated with a stereotypical view of feminine gay men. The term has been in common use for many decades. Gay comedian Kenneth Williams wrote in a diary entry for 1 January 1947: \"Went to Singapore with Stan—very camp evening, was followed, but tatty types so didn't bother to make overtures.\" Although it applies to gay men, it is a specific adjective used to describe a man that openly promotes the fact that he is gay by being outwardly garish or eccentric, for example, the character Daffyd Thomas in the English comedy skit show \"Little Britain\". \"Camp\" forms a strong element in UK culture, and many so-called gay-icons and objects are chosen as such because they are camp. People like Kylie Minogue, John Inman, Lawrence Llewelyn Bowen, Lulu, Graham Norton, Mika, Lesley Joseph, Ruby Wax, Dale Winton, Cilla Black, and the music hall tradition of the pantomime are camp elements in popular culture. The British tradition of the \"Last Night of the Proms\" has been said to glory in nostalgia, camp, and pastiche. Thomas Dworzak published a collection of portrait photographs of Taliban soldiers, found in Kabul photo studios. The \"Taliban\" book shows a campy esthetics, quite close to the gay movement in California or a Peter Greenaway film.\n\nThe Australian theatre and opera director Barrie Kosky is renowned for his use of camp in interpreting the works of the Western canon including Shakespeare, Wagner, Molière, Seneca, Kafka and his 2006 eight-hour production for the Sydney Theatre Company \"The Lost Echo\", based on Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" and Euripides' \"The Bacchae\". In the first act (\"The Song of Phaeton\"), for instance, the goddess Juno takes the form of a highly stylized Marlene Dietrich, and the musical arrangements feature Noël Coward and Cole Porter. Kosky's use of camp is also effectively employed to satirize the pretensions, manners, and cultural vacuity of Australia's suburban middle class, which is suggestive of the style of Dame Edna Everage. For example, in \"The Lost Echo\" Kosky employs a chorus of high school girls and boys: one girl in the chorus takes leave from the goddess Diana, and begins to rehearse a dance routine, muttering to herself in a broad Australian accent, \"Mum says I have to practise if I want to be on \"Australian Idol\".\" See also the works of Australian writer/director Baz Luhrmann, in particular \"Strictly Ballroom\".\n\nSince 2000, the Eurovision Song Contest, an annually televised competition of song performers from different countries, has shown an increased element of camp—since the contest has shown an increasing attraction within the gay communities—in their stage performances, especially during the televised finale, which is screened live across Europe. As it is a visual show, many Eurovision performances attempt to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music, which sometimes leads to bizarre onstage gimmicks, and what some critics have called \"the Eurovision kitsch drive\", with almost cartoonish novelty acts performing.\n\nThe first post-World War II use of the word in print, marginally mentioned in the Sontag essay, may be Christopher Isherwood's 1954 novel \"The World in the Evening\", where he comments: \"You can't camp about something you don't take seriously. You're not making fun of it; you're making fun \"out\" of it. You're expressing what's basically serious to you in terms of fun and artifice and elegance.\" In the American writer Susan Sontag's 1964 essay \"Notes on 'Camp'\", Sontag emphasized artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and shocking excess as key elements of camp. Examples cited by Sontag included Tiffany lamps, the drawings of Aubrey Beardsley, Tchaikovsky's ballet \"Swan Lake\", and Japanese science fiction films such as \"Rodan\", and \"The Mysterians\" of the 1950s.\n\nIn Mark Booth's 1983 book \"Camp\" he defines camp as \"to present oneself as being committed to the marginal with a commitment greater than the marginal merits.\" He carefully discerns the distinction between genuine camp, and \"camp fads and fancies\", things that are not intrinsically camp, but display artificiality, stylization, theatricality, naivety, sexual ambiguity, tackiness, poor taste, stylishness, or portray camp people, and thus appeal to them. He considers Sontag's definition problematical because it lacks this distinction.\n\nAs a cultural challenge, camp can also receive a political meaning, when minorities appropriate and ridicule the images of the dominant group, the kind of activism associated with multiculturalism and the New Left. The best known instance of this is the gay liberation movement, which used camp to confront society with its own preconceptions and their historicity. The first positive portrayal of a gay secret agent in fiction appears in a series, \"The Man from C.A.M.P.\" in which the protagonist is, paradoxically, effeminate yet physically tough. Female camp actresses such as Mae West, Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Bette Davis, Marilyn Monroe, and Joan Crawford also had an important influence on the development of feminist consciousness: by exaggerating certain stereotyped features of femininity, such as fragility, open emotionality or moodiness, they attempted to undermine the credibility of those preconceptions. The multiculturalist stance in cultural studies therefore presents camp as political and critical.\n\nAs a part of its adoption by the mainstream, camp has undergone a softening of its original subversive tone, and is often little more than the recognition that popular culture can also be enjoyed by a sophisticated sensibility. Mainstream comic books and B Westerns, for example, have become standard subjects for academic analysis. The normalisation of the outrageous, common to many Vanguardist movements—has led some critics to argue the notion has lost its usefulness for critical art discourse.\n\nAccording to the sociologist Andrew Ross, camp engages in a redefinition of cultural meaning through a juxtaposition of an outmoded past alongside that which is technologically, stylistically, and sartorially contemporary. Often characterized by the reappropriation of a \"throwaway Pop aesthetic\", camp works to intermingle the categories of \"high\" and \"low\" culture. Objects may become camp objects because of their historical association with a power now in decline. As opposed to kitsch, camp reappropriates culture in an ironic fashion, whereas kitsch is indelibly sincere. Additionally, kitsch may be seen as a quality of an object, while camp, \"tends to refer to a subjective process.\" Those who identify objects as “camp” commemorate the distance mirrored in the process through which, \"unexpected value can be located in some obscure or exorbitant object.\" The effect of camp's irony is problematic, insofar as the agents of cultural redefinition are often of upper- or middle-class standing who could, \"afford, literally, to redefine the life of consumerism and material affluence as a life of spiritual poverty.\"\n\nCamp-style performances may allow certain prejudices to be perpetuated by thinly veiling them as irony. Some feminist critics argue that drag queens are misogynistic because they make women seem ridiculous and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. This criticism posits that drag queens are the gay equivalent of the black and white minstrel. Some critics claim that camp comedians like Larry Grayson, Kenny Everett, Duncan Norvelle and Julian Clary perpetuate gay stereotypes and pander to homophobia. This sign of a privileged cultural position left the lower-class standing incapable of any cultural redefinition, thereby relegating them to a static position which could then only be lifted by those with enough capital.\n\nCamp aesthetics became the curious site of personal liberation from the stranglehold of the corporate, capitalist state. Within the capitalist environment of constant consumption, camp rediscovers history's waste, bringing back objects thought of as refuse or of bad taste. Camp liberates objects from the landfills of history and reinvokes them with a new charisma. In doing so camp creates an economy separate from that of the state. In Ross's words, camp, \"is the re-creation of surplus value from forgotten forms of labor.\" \n\nThis is perhaps why camp often faces criticism from other political and aesthetic perspectives. For example, the most obvious argument is that camp is just an excuse for poor quality work and allows the tacky and vulgar to be recognized as valid art. In doing so, camp celebrates the trivial and superficial and form over content. This could be called the \"yuck factor\". The power of the camp object may be found in its ability to induce this reaction.

In an attempt to \"present a challenge to the mechanisms of control and containment that operate in the name of good taste\", the camp aesthetic has fallen flat on its face and has been appropriated by artists such as Macklemore with his hit single \"Thrift Shop\". Yet, his fame is only enjoyed at the expense of others, as Ross writes, \"it [the pleasure of camp] is the result of the (hard) work of a producer of taste and 'taste' is only possible through exclusion and depreciation.\"\n\n\n"}

He was a colorful cultural personality and one of the central Finnish national awakeners and — later — one of the leading dissidents at the same time.\n\nGottlund pursued the creation of an autonomous Finnish territory from the Finn Forests on both sides of the Swedish-Norwegian border, with great economic and political independence.\n\nGottlund is commonly attributed with saving the folklore of the Forest Finns. Among ideas promoted by Gottlund was the view that all languages are interconnected by the same roots.\n\nIn 1796, Carl Axel Gottlund was born in the Southern Finnish coastal town of Ruotsinpyhtää into the family of a Finnish clergyman Mattias Gottlund, one of the most outstanding representatives of Enlightenment ideas in Finland. Accordingly, Carl Axel was raised in the spirit of the Enlightenment, and the basic structure of his thinking represented rationalistic Enlightenment ideals.\n\nMatthias Gottlund, Carl Axel's father, worked as the chaplain of the local congregation at the time. Carl Axel's mother Ulrika Sophia was from the upper-class family of \"Orraeus\" in the nearby town of Porvoo.\n\nIn 1805, the Gottlund family settled in Juva, in the Finnish province of Savonia, where Gottlund's father had landed to a financially lucrative job as a vicar.\n\nDuring his childhood years, Carl Axel Gottlund's interest towards the Finnish culture and language had been inspired by his father, to the most part. The opportunity in his childhood for Carl Axel to meet with the known Finnish nationalist author \"Jaakko Juteini\" is also believed to have boosted his future career choices and patriotism.\n\nIn 1810, Carl Axel enrolled with the Gymnasium of Porvoo, a junior college in Southern Finland. In 1814, he began studies at the Royal Academy of Turku. At the academy, he had awakening in the Finnish national romanticism.\n\nIn 1815–1816, Carl Axel collected various types of Finnish folklore material from his home county: poems, songs, spells, children's stories and plays, nursery rhymes, etc.\n\nIn 1816, Carl Axel Gottlund began studies at the Uppsala University in Sweden. In Uppsala, Gottlund studied classical languages, natural sciences, history and philosophy.\n\nIn 1817, Gottlund made an exploration trip to the Finnish-inhabited Dalarna area of Central Sweden, to collect Finnish folklore and other ethnographic data as well as genealogical information, the latter partly because he wanted to improve the social circumstances of the Forest Finns and to prevent Sweden from taking ownership of their land. He recorded total of about 50 Finnish language poems, songs and spells during this expedition.\n\nSoon after this, Gottlund published his first book, \"Pieniä runoja Suomen poijille ratoxi I\" (\"Small Poems for the Enjoyment of Finnish Boys - Part I\"), consisting of folklore which he had collected at his home county of Juva in Finland. A 'part II' was published shortly after.\n\nIn the summer of 1821, Gotlund launched another expedition to a Finnish-inhabited part of Sweden, this time covering the south-central Swedish area of Värmland. The expedition lasted until January 1822, after which Gottlund began acting as a political advocate on behalf of the Finnish population of Sweden. Among his accomplishments, Gotlund founded three congregations for the Forest Finns.\n\nFurthermore, in 1821 starting Gottlund began pursuing the creation of an autonomous Finnish county called \"Fennia\" from the Finn Forests on both sides of the Swedish-Norwegian border, north and northeast from the modern-day Norwegian area of Oslo, with great economic and political independence. The tax border would have been removed and land ownership by Swedes and Norwegians would have been restricted. The Swedish-Norwegian border had not been properly established before 1751.\n\nIn attempts to have the Finnish population of Sweden Proper \"Swedified\" and assimilated into the mainstream Swedish society, the use of the Finnish language had become strictly prohibited in Sweden Proper in the mid-17th-century. However, Gottlund estimated that in the beginning of the 19th century the Central Scandinavian Finn Forests' areas which he had visited alone were still home to approximately 40,000 Finnish-speaking Finns, of whom about 14,000 lived in Värmland - this in addition to other Finns such as the Tornedalians and their descendants and the Forest Finns in other parts of Sweden and Norway. It is estimated that \"one of each five Swedes has their roots amongst the Forest Finns\".\n\nEventually - however -, due to his political activism, Gottlund nearly became expelled from Sweden. He was banned from operating in Stockholm, and - amidst his lobbying and campaigning - he was finally exiled from Stockholm to Uppsala. In spite of this total political failure in the creation of the Central Scandinavian autonomous Finnish area, Gottlund had positive cultural influence on the Forest Finns and became a legendary, heroic character in the Finn Forests.\n\nWhile still living in Uppsala and while attending the Uppsala University part-time, Gottlund began preparing an ambitious publication, \"Otava\", aimed to become a Finnish literary monument. Otava was published in three parts between 1828 and 1832. It consisted of articles pertaining to linguistics, history, ethics, religion, folklore and poetry.\n\nHowever, in Finland, Otava was not met with the type of enthusiasm which Gottlund had hoped for. The work was considered to favor too much the Savonian dialects of Finnish language, and its mainly enlightenment-spirited contents were overshadowed by the current of romanticism which now had encaptured Finland, producing epics such as The Kalevala in 1835 and The Tales of Ensign Stål in 1848.\n\nIn 1831, Gottlund married Charlotta Augusta Brink. Over time, the two gave birth to total of 10 children together.\n\nIn 1834, Gottlund returned to Finland, bringing his family along. The family settled in Kuopio, where Gottlund's now widowed mother lived.\n\nIn 1839, Gottlund became a lecturer of Finnish language in the University of Helsinki, which then was known as the \"Imperial Alexander University of Finland\" (from 1828 to 1919).\n\nIn 1842, Gottlund was granted a permission to launch a printing house in Helsinki, the opening of which was delayed until a few years later.\n\nIn 1846, Gottlund published a poetic album named \"Sampo\". The same year, in 1846, Gottlund founded the \"Suomalainen\" newspaper, which was printed in Finnish. Following the publication of a certain polemic article in the paper, the Finnish Senate discontinued the publishing of the paper. However, Gottlund came up with another similar newspaper, \"Suomi\", which was in circulation from 1847 to 1849.\n\nIn 1850, Gottlund sought the professorship of Finnish language at the University of Helsinki. However, Gottlund was found unqualified for the job, following his doctoral thesis - written in Finnish - becoming confiscated, after Gottlund had prematurely published it against the approval of the government-guided censorship. M. A. Castrén was elected for the job. However, he died already a year later. Gottlund now ran for the job against the famed Finnish author Elias Lönnrot. This time Gottlund's doctoral thesis was written in Swedish, but - for the second time - it was disapproved.\n\nThrough his life, Gottlund was passionately interested in archaeology, about which he wrote e.g. in his \"Otava\" series. In the 1850s, he continued exploring the history and culture of the Finnish people. In 1859, Gottlund received a grant from the Senate of Finland to sponsor his archaeological expeditions in various parts of Finland. He promoted the establishment of the professorship of archaeology in Finland, to no prevail.\n\nFollowing the retirement of Elias Lönnrot as the Professor of Finnish language in Helsinki, in 1862, Gottlund's doctoral thesis was finally approved, but again that professorship which he had sought was given to another candidate,\n\nIn the 1860s, Gottlund continued writing and publishing actively. In 1865, he published \"Läsning för finnar\", in which he criticizes his adversaries and discusses the injustices which he had had to experience on his academic career. Among his other accomplishments in the 1860s, Gottlund translated the poetry of the Swedish Carl Michael Bellman into Finnish.\n\nGottlund sought financial backing from Norway, Sweden and Finland for further publications relating to the Forest Finns of Norway and Sweden, to no prevail. In the 1870s, Gottlund participated in publishing of the \"Työmiehen Ystävä\" (\"Friend of the Working Man\") newspaper, for which he also wrote.\n\nSome of the folklore poetry collected by Gottlund in the early 19th century was considered sexually too explicit to be published during his lifetime, and even until quite recently. Some poems collected by him stayed archived until 1997, when they became included in the book \"Suomen Kansan Vanhat Runot\" (\"Old Poems of the Finnish People\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

Named after famed actress on the stage, Helen Dauvray (1859-1923), who presented the cup, it was initially awarded to the winner of the professional baseball championship series tournament (similar to the later inter-league World Series established 1903, between the National and newly organized American League of 1901) then between the two major baseball leagues of the time - the National League (organized 1876) and the American Association which played 1882 to 1891. It was the first \"World Series\" style trophy for the championship team and representative city of American professional sport of baseball. \n\nThe last National League-American Association series was in 1890, with the latter circuit collapsing after the end of the following season of 1891. The cup was then awarded to the winner of the National League pennant. \n\nLike the longtime iconic Stanley Cup of professional ice hockey's National Hockey League, the same trophy was used each season held by the winner then carrying on to the next year's champions rather than a new one being made. The Dauvray Cup has since been lost in a mysterious controversy.\n\nThe cup was named for its presenter, Broadway actress Helen Dauvray. In 1887, Dauvray began a relationship with John Montgomery Ward, shortstop for the New York Giants and future Hall of Famer. Their marriage was announced in October of that year during the World Series.\n\nDauvray first announced her intentions to present the trophy in newspapers on May 21, 1887. The announcement described the cup as \"a $500 silver cup\" in \"the form of a true lovers' cup ... about twelve inches high\". On June 1, the Gorham Silver Company began the process of creating the trophy. When some, including National League president Nicholas Young, suggested that the trophy was more for the owner of the winning team than the players, Dauvray agreed to award gold medals to the players of the winning team as well as one umpire. Some newspapers at the time, including the \"Brooklyn Eagle\" and \"Police Gazette\", dismissed the trophy as a publicity stunt designed more to promote Dauvray herself than out of a fondness for baseball.\n\nThe Dauvray Cup was first won in 1887 by the Detroit Wolverines of the NL, who defeated the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. It would also be won twice by Ward's Giants, in 1888 and 1889. The cup was last awarded in 1893 to the Boston Beaneaters. The Beaneaters had won the cup three years in a row, having won the NL pennant in 1891 and 1892 as well. The rules established at the creation of the cup stated that it would permanently belong to the first team to win it three years in a row. Dauvray, by that time no longer much interested in either Ward—they would divorce in November that same year—or baseball, took no steps to provide a new Dauvray Cup to replace the retired one. A replacement would be provided by William Chase Temple, president of the Pittsburgh Pirates, which became known as the Temple Cup.\n\nAccording to John Thorn, official historian of Major League Baseball, the last mention of the presence of the Dauvray Cup was on November 12, 1893, in Newport, Kentucky. By June 1894, \"Sporting Life\" was wondering in print what had happened to it. The current location of the Dauvray Cup is unknown.\n"}
{"id": "277244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=277244", "title": "Evagrius Scholasticus", "text": "Evagrius Scholasticus\n\nEvagrius Scholasticus () was a Syrian scholar and intellectual living in the 6th century AD, and an aide to the patriarch Gregory of Antioch. His surviving work, \"Ecclesiastical History\" (), comprises a six-volume collection concerning the Church's history from the First Council of Ephesus (431) to Maurice’s reign during his life.\n\nEvagrius Scholasticus was born in Epiphania, a Syrian town located next to the Orontes River in the heart of the Eastern Roman Empire. Controversy exists as to the date on which Evagrius was born, since historian G. F. Chesnut asserts that he was born in either 536 or 537, yet the researcher Whitby claims that he was born in 535. His first written work addressed the plague outbreak which infected a vast segment of the population. Evagrius himself was infected by the outbreak yet miraculously managed to survive this disaster during his youth. According to his own account, close members of his family died from the outbreak, including his wife at the time. Michael Whitby reasons that Evagrius was born into a wealthy aristocratic family with close ties to the political elite.\n\nHis education was long-ranging and comprehensive since early childhood, starting with a specialization in Grammar and transitioning to classical Greek literature. This eventually culminated in Evagrius’s pursuit of legal studies, which upon completion, earned him the prestigious title of “Scholasticus” when he was in his late 20s. His first notable official endeavor was accompanying Gregory of Antioch to Constantinople in order to defend him against charges related to sexual misbehavior. Evagrius again remarried in Antioch, where his own records testify to his prestige among the professional elite since displays of grandeur and a massive audience were present during this wedding ceremony. Dedicated to the emperor Maurice Evagrius wrote many works on theological matters, but none of these survives. His remaining work, \"The Ecclesiastical History\" was complete in 593, a six-volume compilation of Christian history from the first Council of Ephesus to his own present time.\n\nEvagrius was explicitly a Christian in the Chalcedonian tradition, critiquing both Zacharias Rhetor and Zosimus for theological differences, two popular historians during his own time. He respected the former scholar for his contributions to the histories of the 5th and 6th centuries AD but chastised him for his Monophysite position. However, he was especially hostile towards Zosimus, a pagan historiographer, for his vehemently anti-Christian views, stating “ ‘You, O accursed and totally defiled one, say that the fortunes of the Romans wasted away and were altogether ruined from the time when Christianity was made known”, challenging Zosimus's assumption that Rome’s fall began with Constantine’s conversion.\n\nEvagrius’s only surviving work, \"Ecclesiastical History\", addresses the history of the Eastern Roman Empire from the official beginning of the Nestorian controversy at the First Council of Ephesus in 431 to the time in which he was writing, 593. The book’s contents focus mainly on religious matters, describing the events surrounding notable bishops and holy men.\n\nThe \"editio princeps\" was published in 1544 under the name of Robertus Stephanus (better known as Robert Estienne). John Christopherson, bishop of Chichester, made a Latin translation of the \"Ecclesiastical History\", which was published after his death in 1570. Translations into English appeared much later: the first was by Edward Walford, which was published at London in 1846; Michael Whitby's translation was published in 2001 by Liverpool University Press as part of their \"Texts in Translation Series.\"\n\nSome historians, particularly Pauline Allen, allege that Evagrius’s Chalcedonian theological stance directly influenced his selection of information, in order to defend Chalcedonian-aligned political agents against negative reputation. Whitby, however, emphasizes the legal scholar's acceptance and inclusion of information written by other historians who adopted opposing stances, when he discerned that their accounts were reliable. For example, Evagrius Scholasticus relies heavily on Zachariah’s textual study of history even though he was a monophysite, occasionally omitting minor facets of his work that explicitly promote his theology, but largely considering him to be dependable. Allen also reasons that Evagrius built on Zachariah’s work because his was the only comprehensive historical account of events taking place from Theodoret of Cyrus’s time till his own era. Unfortunately, however, Zachariah’s original manuscripts have been lost.\n\nEvagrius is much less critical of the Emperor Justinian and his wife Theodora, in comparison with Procopius, who described the two as physically manifest demons. Because of regional affiliations Evagrius depicts the emperor in a more sympathetic light, praising his moderate approach to justice and his restraint towards excessive persecution, yet still decrying his heresy and displays of wealth. Evagrius’s ambivalence to Justinian is especially evident when he describes him as a virtuous man yet blind to impending defeat in his self-initiated war with Persia. Chesnut also comments on how the Roman historian and scholar endues his \"Ecclesiastical History\" with a dramatic style, using themes from classical Greek tragedies to characterize Justinian’s life, particularly Fortune’s grand fluctuations.\n\nEvagrius builds upon the documents written by Zachariah, Symeon Stylites the Elder, Eustathius of Epiphania, John Malalas, Zosimus, and Procopius of Caesarea.\n\n\"The Ecclesiastical History\" is considered an important and relatively authoritative account of the timeline it traces, since Evagrius draws on other scholars’ material, explicitly acknowledging his sources. He meticulously organizes information taken from other written historical works in order to validate his account more effectively than other theological scholars of his time, thus diminishing confusion for future historian’s interested in studying his work. However, historians acknowledge that there are serious logical errors inherent in Evagrius’s surviving work, which is common for its epoch, namely the problematic chronological sequencing and skimming over of undeniably notable events such as major wars and other secular events. When the scholar mentions important occasions in his own life, lack of chronological labeling is especially evident – which can provide complications to those analyzing his book.\n\n\n"}

A brilliant student in high school in Valence, then a scholarship holder for license and aggregation at the Faculty of Arts of Lyon, he was formed by the teaching of Henri Lechat Maurice Holleaux and Philippe-Ernest Legrand and chosen to be a member of the French School at Athens in 1905.\n\nAfter a stay at the Académie de France in Rome (Villa Medici), he joined the great archaeological sites of Delos and Delphi under the leadership of Maurice Holleaux. An archaeologist coupled with a designer and very expert in architecture, he realized the then so rare type of archaeologist-architect that was missing in the French School at Athens, and contributed to a capital change in French methods in archeology.\n\nAt Delos, he became interested in 1906 in the proto-history of the sanctuary, unearthed the \"Portico Antigone\" with one of the tombs of the Hyperborean Virgins (the Theke), and discovered the remains of a Minoan and Mycenaean Delos in the sanctuary of Apollo and Artemis. With Charles Picard, he prepared the enhancement of the excavations of the city and the Temple of Zeus by a mission to Stratos (Acarnania). At Delphi, his studies on the tholos of the Sicycone Treasury, the east pediment of the archaic temple on the nearby monument of the opisthodomos, and especially the terrace of the temple renewed the knowledge of Delphic monuments.\n\nMobilized in 1914 and assigned in 1915 to the 176th Infantry Regiment, it was in the uniform of an adjutant (and under the Turkish balls) that he participated in the development of Macedonia excavations, especially the necropolis of Elaeusin in Thrace, unearthed during work entrenchment in the Dardanelles in early June 1915. He cumulated these archaeological activities with the function of officer-interpreter by the 2nd office of the General Staff of the Armies of the East in Salonika. His role in the development of the victorious offensive which forced Bulgaria to ask for an armistice September 29, 1918 earned him the Greek Medal of Military Merit and the French Croix de Guerre with citation to the order of the Eastern Army.\n\nAs soon as 1919, resuming the publication of the monuments of the terrace of the temple of Apollo at Delphi interrupted by the war, he undertook a comprehensive study of the altar of Pythian Apollo.\n\nIt was in Delos that Fernand Courby started his study on \"Les vases grecs à reliefs\" (from prehistoric to Roman times), which he made the subject of his doctoral thesis published in 1922. This book of reference on the pottery of ancient Greece earned him the medal of the Institut de France in 1926.\n\nAppointed a professor of Greek philology and epigraphy at the University of Lyon in 1922, Fernand Courby founded in 1923 the \"Institut d'épigraphie grecque\", which in 1961 took the name \"Institut Fernand Courby\" (a laboratory of the CNRS since 1967).\n\nIn 1931, Fernand Courby published his last book on Delos, \"Les temples d'Apollon\". Surgery was performed too late for a mastoiditis and he died of meningitis March 6, 1932, aged 54.\n\nAt the time of his death he was preparing a study on Greek house for the series \"La vie publique et privée des anciens Grecs\" (Collection Budé). He was twice holder of the Grand silver medal of the Société centrale des architectes français.\n\nLeft a widower in 1914 with two young daughters, Anne (born in 1912) and Irène (born 1914), Fernand Courby remarried in 1922 with the daughter of the Hellenist Fernand Allègre, with whom he had a daughter, Françoise (born 1924).\n\n"}

Elected to the Romanian Senate for Iași County in 2000 on the lists of the extremist Greater Romania Party, he served as a vice president of that body over the next four years. He is best known for his controversial publications about the Jews and the Holocaust in Romania during World War II.\n\nBuzatu finished elementary and high school in the city of Râmnicu Sărat and later studied history and linguistics at the University of Iași. In 1971, he received his PhD in history. Between 1961 and 1992, he worked as a researcher at the Iași institute for archeology and history and was the chief researcher in the Center for History and European studies of the Romanian Academy. In 1992, he became the director of this center.\n\nBuzatu published 25 books and was involved in the writing of several others. One of his best-known works is the book \"Românii în arhivele Kremlinului\" (Romanians in the Kremlin's archives), published in 1996. The book's chief thesis is that the Jews were responsible for the mass suffering and massacre of Romanians by the communist regime. A chapter in the book, \" Aşa a început Holocaustul împotriva poporului român\" (Thus began the Holocaust against the Romanian people) was published in 1995 as a brochure by the extreme right group \"The Legionnaires\". In this chapter, Buzatu claimed that the Jews have the main responsibility for the Holocaust of the Romanian people which began in 1940 with the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.\nIn July 2001, Buzatu organized a Symposium on the subject of the Holocaust of the Jews in Romania. This symposium, titled \"Holocaust în România?\", mainly questioned the existence of the Holocaust of the Jewish people in Romania and the responsibility of the Romanian government for the mass murders committed on Romanian-controlled territories taken from the Soviet Union in 1941. After the symposium, Buzatu established \"Liga pentru Combaterea Antiromânismului\" (the league against anti-Romanianism) with himself as president.\n\nHolocaust historian Randolph Braham described Buzatu as a \"Holocaust denier historian and an expert in manipulating public opinion\".\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004, Buzatu represented Iași County in the Romanian Senate. In 2002, after parliament passed a law forbidding Holocaust denial, Buzatu offered to change the definition of \"Holocaust\". According to the proposal, the definition should be \"a mass organized annihilation of Jewish population in Europe, committed by the Nazi authorities\". Thus, Buzatu's proposal would have had the effect of saying there was no Holocaust in Romania because Nazi Germany did not directly rule Romania during the war.\n\nIn 2004, Buzatu was awarded the Order of the Star of Romania by president Ion Iliescu.\nBuzatu died in 2013.\n\n"}

Mandhatra was killed by Lavanasura who was killed later by Rama's brother Shatrughna. This is one of ancient India's most prominent and famous lineages, having produced Rama and his 3 brothers (See Genealogy of Rama) and Yadava lineage from Ikshvaku King Haryaswa in which Krishna was born. Jayadratha of Mahabharata also belonged to solar line. The first notable king of the dynasty was Ikshvaku. Other Brahmin gotras from solar line are Vatula, Shatamarshana, Kutsa, Bhadrayana and Vishnuvriddha. Of these Kutsa and Shatamarshana also descend from King Mandhatra like Harita gotra and have either Mandhatra or his sons (Ambarish/Purukutsa) as part of their Pravaras.

To this day, many Kshatriyas claim descent from the Suryavanshi dynasty to substantiate their claims to royalty.\n\nBrahmins of the Harita gotra trace their lineage to the eponymous prince. While most Brahmins claim to be descended from ancient sages, those of the Harita gotra claim to be descended from Kshatriyas trained by the Brahmin Angirasa and hence they have some kshatriya and some brahmin qualities. This created, according to the \"Linga Purana\", \"Brahmins with the qualities of Kshatriyas\". \n\nThis is recorded in the Hindu tradition in the \"Vishnu Purana\":\n\n\"Ambarishasya Mandhdtus tanayasya Yuvanasvah putro bhut tasmad Harito yato ngiraso Haritah\". \"The son of Ambarisha, son of Mandhatri was Yuvanasva From him sprang Harita from whom the Harita Angirases were descended.\n\nand in the \"Linga Purana\":\n\n\"Harito Yuvanasvasya Harita yata atmajah ete hy Angirasah pakshe kshattropeta dvijatayah\". \"The son of Yuvanasva was Harita of whom the Haritash were sons\". \"They were on the side of Angiras twice born men.\" \"Brahmans of Kshattriya lineage.\"\n\nand in the \"Vayu Purana\":\n\n\"they were the sons of Haritash / Angiras, twice-born men (Brahmans), of Kshatriya race,\" or sons of Harita raised up by Sage Angiras.\n\nAccordingly, from both Linga Purana and Vayu Purana it can be inferred that brahmins with Harita gotra belong to Ikshvaku lineage and because of the training and tapo sakti of Angirasa and blessings of Lord Adi Kesava obtained Brahmin qualities, and became twice born. \n\nThe of this gotra, used in ceremonies to reference the ancestors of the participant Brahmin has 2 variations:\n\nSage Harita, son of Chyavana, wrote the Harita Smriti, a work of law, and taught his student, Bappa Rawal of Guhilot (later to be called Sisodia) martial arts and the four cardinal duties for the service of the state:\n\n\nThis Sthalapuranam was narrated by Mudal (first) Thirthakar (priest) of the Sriperumpudur temple.\n\nOnce there lived a great King named Haritha; he was the grandson of King Ambareesha, who is an ancestor of Sri Rama.\n\nOnce he was passing by a dense forest where he hears the shrill moaning of a cow. He goes in the direction where the voice was coming; he sees that a tiger has caught the cow and was about to kill the cow.\n\nSince he is a Kshatriya and a king, he feels that it is his duty to protect the weak, and that there is no sin in killing the tiger. He aims at the tiger. Meanwhile, the tiger also thinks it should do something that the king also suffers and with that it kills the cow and King Haritha kills the tiger.\n\nSince he has witnessed the Go Hatya(Death of sacred cow) taking place, the king is affected by the Go Hathi Dosham (sin). He gets worried, when suddenly he hears an Asareeri (Divine Voice) which asks him to proceed to Sathyavratha Kshetram and to take bath in Ananthah Sarasu and worship Lord Adhi Keshava, whereby his sins will vanish.\n\nKing Harita goes back to Ayodhya and consults Vashishta Maharishi, who tells him about the Sriperumpudur Mahatyam and narrates how the Bhootha Ganas (those who serve Lord Shiva in Shiv Lok) got rid of their Saapam (curse) there,and also the route to that place. King Haritha then makes alternative arrangement to run the kingdom and proceeds to Sriperumpudur (near Chennai, Tamil Nadu).\n\nHe takes bath in Ananthah Sarasu and prays to Lord Adhi Kesava; after a while the merciful lord appears before Haritha Maharaja and instructs him on all the Mantras which would help in getting rid of the Dosham. He also says that though all these years he was a Kshtriya, due to his blessings he has now become a Brahmin, and henceforth his descendants will also be Brahmins (even today his descendants are known as Brahmins of Haritha Gothra). The Lord also gives Upadesham of all Mantras to him. Haritha Maharaja rebuilds the Adhi Kesava temple, and performs consecration of the temple on an auspicious day.\n"}

He established the history curriculum used in Israel's High Schools.\n\nKatz described \"traditional society\" and deployed sociological methods in his study of Jewish communities, with special attention to changes in halakhah (Jewish law) and Orthodoxy. He pioneered the modern study of Orthodoxy and its formation in reaction to Reform Judaism.\n\nIn the year 1945 Jacob Katz presented to a conference of historians his article \"Marriage and Sexual Relations at the close of the Middle Ages\" which was published that year in the periodical \"Zion\". Katz, who lived at that time in Tel Aviv and worked as a lecturer at College of Education, had already been credited with a few articles in the fields of education, psychology, and pedagogy, and their publication had given him a good reputation in the field. However, this reputation alone did not make him happy; he even suspected that it might distance him from what he craved most of all: to get back to engagement in history research. It was Ben-Zion Dinur who encouraged Katz not to give up on his research even in the absence of an academic post. Indeed, despite the difficulty of setting aside time for research, Katz succeeded in completing the article mentioned. Its publication in the pages of \"Zion\" gave rise to favourable responses, and even won Katz an invitation to the first International Congress of Jewish studies in Jerusalem in 1947. With hindsight it is possible to claim that Katz's article on \"Marriage and Sexual Relations\" in \"Zion\" paved the way for his joining the faculty of Hebrew University. At the approach of the academic year 1949-1950, the University invited Katz to serve as an adjunct instructor, offering him 25% of a full-time post.\n\nKatz became a specialist in Jewish-gentile relations, the Jewish Enlightenment, or Haskalah, anti-Semitism, and the Holocaust. His works in Hebrew provide much of the basis for scholarly analyses of anti-Semitism.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is principally known as an author of religious and historical writings. \n\nRamus was born at Aukra in Møre og Romsdal, Norway. His parents were parish priest Danil Johnsen Ramus (d. 1654) and Anna Christensdatter Bernhoft (1624–1705). Ramus belonged a family of clerics, with the father, grandfather, stepfather and two brothers, clerics and scholars in various positions. He lost his father early, but her stepfather, Hans Olsen Brejer, took responsibility for his basic education. After studies at the Trondheim Cathedral School, in 1665 he was discharged to the University of Copenhagen with two of his brothers. For the next 15 years, he is believed to have continued studying in Copenhagen.\n\nIn the 1680s Ramus became personnel chaplain in Sørum Church (\"Sørum kirke\") in Romerike under the priest Colbjørn Torstensen Arneberg. From 1690 Ramus was senior priest of Norderhov Church (\"Norderhov kirke\") at Ringerike in Buskerud. Ramus became a magistrate in 1698.\n\nIn 1680, he published his first book, \"Naadens aandelige Markets-Tiid\". It quickly became popular and was issued in both Swedish and Danish editions. Ramus also wrote about the famous Maelstrom at Moskenstraumen. His work was read by Edgar Allan Poe and featured in his short story \"A Descent into the Maelström\" (1841).\n\nPerhaps his best known book was \"Norges Beskrivelse\" which contains a poem about a feral child, \"Jostedalsrypa\". She was the only survivor of the Black Death in the remote valley of Jostedal after of the Black Death (\"Svartedauden\").\n\nIn 1682, he married Anna Colbjørnsdatter (ca. 1667- 1736), the daughter of pastor Colbjørn Torstensen Arneberg (1628–1720) in Sørum. They had five children: Ole (1683-1714), Daniel (1684-1727), Johanna (1685-1717), Christian (1686-1714) and Anna Sophie (1687-1722), all of whom were born in Sørum. Their son, Daniel Ramus followed his father as a priest in Norderhov from 1717, when his father was sick. Ramus died in 1718 at Norderhov. \n\nAnna Colbjørnsdatter became known for her role in the skirmish at Norderhov (\"Slaget på Norderhov\") between Norwegian-Danish and Swedish forces on 29 March 1716. She and her family were residing in the Norderhov Rectory in Ringerike. Reportedly she alerted the Norwegians to the presence of the troops of King Charles XII of Sweden in the church yard at Norderhov, where they had taken shelter in and around the rectory. The event itself was first published by Peter Andreas Munch in his book, \"Norges, Sveriges og Danmarks Historie til Skolebrug\" (1838).\n\nHer half-brothers, Hans Colbjørnsen (1675-1754) and Peder Colbjørnsen (1683–1738), were successful timber merchants in Fredrikshald.

He was educated at Bramham College near Tadcaster.\n\nJoining his father in business at age 19, Knight began collecting books. With Alfred Austin, his junior by six years, he helped to found a Mechanics' Institute at Leeds, at which he lectured on literary subjects. On 7 April 1854 he lectured on \"The Fairies of English Poetry\" to the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society. At Leeds, too, he made the acquaintance of William Edward Forster, who stayed at Knight's house while he was parliamentary candidate for the constituency in 1859. Knight seconded Forster's nomination.\n\nIn 1860 Knight moved to London as a journalist. He found early employment as dramatic critic for the \"Literary Gazette\", through a chance meeting with the editor John Morley. He then concentrated on writing about the contemporary stage. In 1869 he succeeded John Abraham Heraud, as dramatic critic of the \"Athenæum\", and retained the post for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1871, during the siege of Paris, Knight used his influence to secure the invitation to the Comedie Française to act at the Gaiety Theatre in London. He also acted as dramatic critic for the \"Sunday Times\", \"The Globe\", and for the \"Daily Graphic\" from 1894 to 1906.\n\nIn London Knight moved in literary and dramatic circles. Early associates included John Westland Marston and Sebastian Evans. At Marston's house he met authors and playwrights; Thomas Purnell introduced him to Swinburne, to whom and Dante Gabriel Rossetti he became close.\n\nKnight contributed the causerie signed \"Sylvanus Urban\" to the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" from 1887 till near his death, and he was a reviewer of general literature for the \"Athenæum\". In July 1883, on the death of Henry Frederic Turle, he became editor of \"Notes and Queries\", and retained the position for life. A bohemian and clubman, he was a leading member of the Arundel Club; after 1883, when he was elected to the Garrick Club (3 March), he was mainly found there. On 4 July 1905 the dramatic profession entertained him, as the oldest living dramatic critic, to dinner at the Savoy Hotel. Sir Henry Irving took the chair, and Benoît-Constant Coquelin and Gabrielle Réjane were among the guests.\n\nOn 4 May 1893 Knight was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. A book collector through life, he twice had to sell up, on the second occasion in 1905. He died at his house, 27 Camden Square, on 23 June 1907, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. A posthumous portrait in oils by Margaret Grose was presented to the Garrick Club in 1912 by Knight's friend Henry Benjamin Wheatley.\n\nKnight wrote on theatre history, and was the main contributor of the lives of actors to the \"Dictionary of National Biography\", first edition and first supplement. His articles numbered over 500. The biography of David Garrick was the basis of a separate memoir (1894). He published in 1893 \"Theatrical Notes 1874-1879\" (1893), a collection of articles on the drama from the \"Athenæum\", and he edited in 1886 the \"Roscius Anglicanus\" of John Downes. In 1887 Knight published the \"Life of Rossetti\" in the \"Great Writers series\".\n\nKnight married at the parish church, Leeds, on 3 June 1856, Rachel (d. 1911), youngest daughter of John Wilkinson of Gledhall Mount near Leeds. He had issue a son Philip Sidney, b. 2 Feb. 1857, who emigrated to Australia; and two daughters, Gertrude who married Ian Forbes Robertson, parents of Beatrice Forbes-Robertson Hale; and Florence Mabel, who married Edward Mansel Sympson, of Lincoln, on 3 October 1888.\n\n"}

This proposed pipeline became known as the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline.\n\nThe inquiry cost C$5.3 million, and produced over 40,000 pages of text and evidence, comprising 283 volumes. The commission recommended that no pipeline be built through the northern Yukon and that a pipeline through the Mackenzie Valley should be delayed for 10 years.\n\nThe commissioner of the inquiry was Justice Thomas Berger. Justice Berger heard testimony from diverse groups with an interest in the pipeline. Fourteen groups became full participants in the inquiry, attending all meetings and testifying before the commission. The inquiry was notable for the voice it gave to the aboriginal people whose traditional territory the pipeline would traverse. \n\nBerger travelled extensively in the North in preparation for the hearings. He took his commission to all 35 communities along the Mackenzie River Valley, as well as in other cities across Canada, to gauge public reaction. In his travels he met with aboriginal (i.e. Dene, Inuit, Métis) and non-aboriginal residents. He held formal hearings in Yellowknife to get the views of experts about the proposal. Following this, he held community hearings across the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, and this played an important role in shaping his views.\n\nBerger's report first volume was released on June 9, 1977 and followed with a second volume several months later. Titled \"Northern Frontier, Northern Homeland\", the two-volume report highlighted the fact that while the Mackenzie Valley could be the site of the \"biggest project in the history of free enterprise,\" it was also home to many peoples whose lives would be immeasurably changed by the pipeline. \n\nThe Berger Report concluded that the northern Yukon was too susceptible to environmental harm. Berger cautioned that a gas pipeline would be a precursor to an oil pipeline. The energy transportation corridor thus created would require an immense infrastructure of roads, airports, maintenance bases and new settlements to support it. The impact on the ecosystem (both the natural habitat and its people) would be equivalent to building a railway across Canada. The commission even recommended that no energy corridor be built in the Mackenzie Delta region. At the same time, the commission saw no significant environmental risk further south through the Mackenzie Valley. Berger suggested that a number of sanctuaries and protected areas be created for threatened and endangered species, particularly Porcupine caribou, white whales, several bird species, and other animals inhabiting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).\n\nThe commission found no significant economic benefit from the pipelines. The report concluded that large-scale projects based on non-renewable energy sources rarely provide long-term employment, and that those locals that did find work during construction could only fill low-skill, low-wage positions. In addition, Berger feared that pipeline development would undermine local economies which relied on hunting, fishing, and trapping, possibly even increasing economic hardship in the area. Berger ultimately found that the economy of the region would not be harmed by \"not\" building the pipeline.\n\nThe commission believed that the pipeline process had not taken native culture seriously, and that any development needed to conform to the wishes of those who lived there. Berger predicted that the \"social consequences of the pipeline will not only be serious—they will be devastating.\" The commission was particularly concerned about the role of natives in development plans. At the time the report was released, there were several ongoing negotiations over native land claims in the area, and Berger suggested that pipeline construction be delayed until those claims were settled. The commission found that the local population would not accept development activity without some native control. In addition, land claims were part of a broader native rights issues that needed to be settled between the government and the First Nations. In Berger's view, rapid development in the north would preclude settlement of these important issues due to the influx of non-native populations and growing business interests.\n\nJustice Berger recommended a ten-year moratorium to deal with critical issues—such as settling Aboriginal land claims and setting aside key conservation areas—before attempting to build the proposed pipeline.\n\nInitiated in 1999 by Aboriginal leaders from across the Northwest Territories, the Mackenzie Gas Project constitutes the second attempt to build a gas pipeline down the Mackenzie Valley.\n\n\n"}

This is almost certainly a later embellishment to her story.\nIt is also untrue that she disguised herself as a man under the name of \"Manuel Martinez\" or that after reaching the rank of captain her sex was discovered at the siege of Zaragoza.\nIt is known that she joined the guerrillas without hiding her sex, as did other women.\n\nMore legends and misconceptions: \n-Ibaibarriaga was commissioned in the Spanish army disguised as a man.\n-She took the name of \"Manuel Martínez\".\n-She is the only known example in the Peninsular War of a woman enlisting and serving as a man.\n-She was seriously wounded during the Second Siege of Zaragoza in 1809 and her true identity was discovered.\nWhen she fought in the Battle of Vitoria she came to the attention of General Wellington Francisco de Longa played a joke on Wellington, praising the courage of \"Martin\" before revealing that she was a woman. The truth is that Wellington was several kilometers away from the area where Longa's troops fought and could not see Martina in combat.

It is said that a young priest in the same town went out hunting all day without catching any hares. He blamed María de Zozaya, who reportedly confessed to the inquisitors that after the priest had passed her house she turned herself into a hare and ran ahead of him and his hounds the whole day long, thus making them exhausted.

He served as the editor of Dergi, one of the publications of the Institute for the Study of the USSR in Munich, and was among the first scholars to explore the fate of ethnic minorities living in the Soviet Union.\n\nEdige's father Mustafa Shinkievich, who was descended from a Lithuanian Tatar or Polish Tatar family, had moved to Crimea before World War I. He was a descendent of soldiers under the command of the Golden Horde Khan Toktamish who had fled to Lithuania in the late 14th century.\n\nBorn in Bahçesaray in 1911, Edige received his early education in Dereköy, near Yalta and graduated from the Russian gymnasium in Yalta. He enrolled in the Institute of Pedagogy in Simferopol, now the Crimea State Medical University, but his involvement in Crimean Tatar nationalist activities made it impossible for him to remain in Crimea.\n\nThe Soviet repression, marked by the arrest, execution and deportation of thousands of Tatars, forced Edige to flee to Azerbaijan and then to Iran. He arrived in Istanbul in 1932. Two years later, he joined his uncle Yakup Shinkievich, who was serving in Vilnius, a city then under Polish rule. Edige graduated from the University of Vilnius with a degree in political science in 1939. Following the invasion of Poland by German forces in September 1939, he left for Berlin and then for Istanbul.

She is currently an Adjunct Professor of History and Anthropology and Professor of Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto in Canada. Her work originally focused on France, but has since broadened to include other parts of Europe, North America, and the Caribbean. For example, \"Trickster Travels\" (2006) views Italy, Spain, Morocco and other parts of North Africa and West Africa through the lens of Leo Africanus's pioneering geography. It has appeared in four translations, with three more on the way. Davis' books have all been translated into other languages: twenty-two for \"The Return of Martin Guerre.\" She is a hero to many historians and academics, as \"one of the greatest living historians\", constantly asking new questions and taking on new challenges, the second female president of the American Historical Association (the first, Nellie Neilson, was in 1943) and someone who \"has not lost the integrity and commitment to radical thought which marked her early career\".\n\nShe has been awarded the Holberg International Memorial Prize and National Humanities Medal and been named Companion of the Order of Canada.\n\nDavis was born in Detroit into a middle-class family, the daughter of 19th century Jewish immigrants to the United States. She attended Kingswood School Cranbrook and was subsequently educated at Smith College, Radcliffe College, Harvard University, and the University of Michigan, from which she received her PhD in 1959. In 1948, she married Chandler Davis.\n\nShe and Davis had difficulties in the U.S. during the era of the Red Scare. He lost his professorship in Michigan, and in the 1960s, they moved to Canada (Toronto) with their three children.\n\nNatalie Zemon Davis subsequently taught at Brown University, the University of Toronto, the University of California at Berkeley, and from 1978 to her retirement in 1996, at Princeton University, where she became the Henry Charles Lea Professor of History and director of the Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Historical Studies. In addition to courses in the history of early modern France, she has taught or co-taught courses in history and anthropology, early modern Jewish social history, and history and film. She has also been an important figure in the study of the history of women and gender, founding with Jill Ker Conway a course in that subject in 1971 at the University of Toronto: one of the first in North America. Since her retirement, she has been living in Toronto, where she is Adjunct Professor of History and Anthropology and Professor of Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto.\n\nNatalie Davis' main interests are in social and cultural history, especially of those previously ignored by historians. She makes use of numerous sources such as judicial records, plays, notarial records, tax rolls, early printed books and pamphlets, autobiographies and folk tales. She is a proponent of cross-disciplinary history, which consists of combining history with disciplines such as anthropology, ethnography and literary theory. In her \"Society and Culture in Early Modern France\" (1975), she explored the lives of artisans and peasants: their relation to the Protestant Reformation, their carnivals, uprisings, and religious violence, and the impact of printing on their ways of thinking.\n\nIn her book best known to the public, \"The Return of Martin Guerre\" (1983), she followed a celebrated case of a 16th-century impostor in a village in the Pyrénées so as to see how peasants thought about personal identity. Often linked with Carlo Ginzburg's microhistory \"The Cheese and the Worms\" about the radical miller Menocchio, Davis's book grew out of her experience as historical consultant for Daniel Vigne's film \"Le retour de Martin Guerre\". Her book first appeared in French in 1982 at the same time as the premiere of the film.\n\nDavis's interest in story-telling continued with her book, \"Fiction in the Archives: Pardon Tales and their Tellers in 16th-century France\" (1987), a study of the stories people of all classes told to the king to get pardoned for homicide in the days before manslaughter was a possible plea. In her \"Women on the Margins \"(1995), she looked at the autobiographical accounts of three 17th-century women – the Jewish merchant Glikl Hamel, the Catholic nun Marie de l'Incarnation, who came to New France, and the Protestant entomologist-artist Maria Sibylla Merian—and discussed the role of religion in their lives.\n\nDavis's studies of the past have sometimes had present-day resonance. Her book on \"The Gift in Sixteenth-Century France\" (2000) is both a picture of gifts and bribes in the 16th century and a discussion of a viable mode of exchange different from the market. In \"Trickster Travels\" (2006), she describes how the early 16th-century North African Muslim \"Leo Africanus\" (Hasan al-Wazzan) managed to live as a Christian in Italy after he was kidnapped by Christian pirates and also sees his writings as an example of \"the possibility of communication and curiosity in a world divided by violence.\" In 2017, she served as historical consultant for Wajdi Mouawad's new play \"Tous des Oiseaux\" that premiered in Paris at the Théâtre de La Colline. Set in present-day New York and Jerusalem, the play follows a German/Israeli family riven by conflict when the geneticist son wants to marry an Arab-American woman who is doing her doctoral dissertation on Hassan al-Wazzan/Leo Africanus, the subject of Davis' \"Trickster Travels\" Her book (in-process), \"Braided Histories\" on 18th-century Suriname studies networks of communication and association among families, both slave and free, on the plantations of Christian and Jewish settlers.\n\nThough Davis's historical writings are extensively researched, she sometimes resorts to speculation, using analogous evidence and inserting words like \"perhaps\" and phrases like \"she may have thought.\" Some critics of her work find this troubling and think that this practice threatens the empirical base of the historian's profession. Davis's answer to this is suggested in her 1992 essay \"Stories and the Hunger to Know,\" where she argues both for the role of interpretation by historians and their essential quest for evidence about the past: both must be present and acknowledged to keep people from claiming that they have an absolute handle on \"truth.\" She opened her \"Women on the Margins\" with an imaginary dialogue, in which her three subjects upbraid her for her approach and for putting them in the same book. In her \"Slaves on Screen\" (2000), Davis maintains that feature films can provide a valuable way of telling about the past, what she calls \"thought experiments,\" but only so long as they are connected with general historical evidence.\n\nIn 2010, Davis was awarded the Holberg International Memorial Prize, worth 4.5 million Norwegian kroner (~$700,000 US), for her narrative approach to the field of history. The awards citation described her as \"one of the most creative historians writing today\" who inspired younger generations of historians and promoted \"cross-fertilization between disciplines\". The citation said her compelling narrative \"shows how particular events can be narrated and analyzed so as to reveal deeper historical tendencies and underlying patterns of thought and action\".\n\nOn 29 June 2012, Davis was named Companion of the Order of Canada, the highest class within the order.\n\nOn 10 July 2013, Davis was awarded the 2012 National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama for \"her insights into the study of history and her exacting eloquence in bringing the past into focus.\"\n\nOn 13 September 2013, Davis was awarded an honorary degree from the University of St Andrews.\n\n\n\n"}

She met Vincent van Gogh when she was 12 or 13. She received news media attention in 1985, after turning 110. Subsequent investigation found documentation for Calment's age, beyond any reasonable question, in the records of her native city, Arles, France. More evidence of Calment's lifespan has been produced than for any other supercentenarian, such that her case serves as an archetype in the methodology for verifying the ages of the world's oldest people.\n\nAs women live longer than men on average, combined records for both sexes are predominated by women. The longest undisputed lifespan for a man is that of Jiroemon Kimura of Japan (1897–2013), who died at age 116 years, 54 days.\n\nSince the death of 117-year-old Chiyo Miyako of Japan on 22 July 2018, 115-year-old Kane Tanaka, also of Japan, born 2 January 1903, is the oldest living person in the world whose age has been documented.

Scholar David Whisnant has argued that settlement schools created a version of \"traditional\" Appalachian culture that appealed to outsiders but had little basis in the values of Appalachian people themselves.\n\nThe Appalachian settlement schools were inspired by the settlement movement that started in London in the late 19th century and was represented in the United States by urban settlement houses, including Hull House in Chicago and the Henry Street Settlement in New York City. A large fraction of settlement schools were founded as Christian missions and had a religious purpose in addition to a social welfare purpose.\n\nPossibly the earliest manifestation of the settlement movement in southern Appalachia was the Log Cabin Settlement near Asheville, North Carolina, started in September 1894 by Susan Chester. Chester, a graduate of Vassar College, had experience with urban settlements in the northeastern United States. She considered the people of rural Appalachia to be \"the purest Americans to be found\" and envisioned her Log Cabin Settlement as an opportunity to \"revive the weaving industry... and provide a good library for the community\" in cooperation with a mission chapel and district school.\n\nHindman Settlement School, in Hindman, Kentucky, is considered the first rural social settlement school in the United States, established in 1902 by May Stone and Katherine Pettit at the forks of Troublesome Creek in Knott County, Kentucky.\n\nThe women's fraternity Pi Beta Phi opened the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in 1912 to provide education, economic opportunity, and health care to the rural area at the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains. The school also conducted arts and crafts classes in an effort to preserve and promote the region's crafts tradition.\n\nPine Mountain Settlement School, in Harlan County, Kentucky, was founded by William Creech, Sr., in 1913. Creech, a local resident, donated land for the school and recruited Katherine Pettit and Ethel DeLong to establish and run the institution.\n\nSettlement schools typically had large campuses, including dormitories for boarding students. They functioned not only as schools, but also as community centers.\n\nWith the establishment of public schools in the region in the 1920s and 1930s, settlement schools relinquished their role in the general education of children. Pine Mountain was a boarding school for elementary and middle school-age children until about 1930, when it became a residential high school after public elementary schools were established in the region. Some settlement schools closed, but others assumed new functions over time. Hindman Settlement School offers adult education, including GED test preparation, and operates a tutorial program for people with dyslexia. Since the early 1970s Pine Mountain Settlement School has specialized in environmental education; it also has operated an elderhostel program. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School began an extension called the Craft Work Shop in 1945 in cooperation with the University of Tennessee; it is now an independent nonprofit organization known as the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts that provides college and graduate-level courses in arts and crafts.\n\nThe following are examples of settlement schools and other institutions (most no longer in operation) that were first founded as settlement schools:\n\n\n"}

The buildings are situated between Schloss Rapperswil, Stadtpfarrkirche Rapperswil and \"Engelplatz\" square.\n\nBreny house and Breny tower are part of the remains of the northeastern town walls of the medieval city of Rapperswil. The buildings date back to early 13th century AD, when the lords of Russikon (Russinger) built a residential tower respectively a small castle as servants (Ministerials) of the Counts of Rapperswil. In its present form, it was built in 1492 by the knight Hans of Landenberg from the Töss Valley replacing the former seat of the lords of Russikon. The Landenberg family officiated in Rapperswil as mayors and councils to 1530. Subsequent occupants were from 1530 to 1660 the Göldlin family, then the Good family, and from 1758 the Breny family. The former castle with its high residential tower at the so-called \"Herrenberg\" (\"castle hill\") marked in the 16th century the urban expansion of the Middle Ages city to the northeast. The buildings were part of the northeasterly town walls at the bay of Kempraten on Lake Zürich shore heading to the so-called \"Herrenbergtor\" gate (broken in 1848).\n\nThe largely conserved residential facilities date back to the 16th century when the castle was owned by Thuring Göldli. The Gothic hall with beamed ceiling and flower garlands, like the other rooms in the initial stage of construction, is largely preserved. The living room is decorated with late Gothic and partly overpainted wall painting among them the coats of arms of the Landenberg and Hünenberg families (as of 1492). The Breny room (\"Breny-Stube\") and the Landenberg room (as of 1503) are in their original condition.\n\nThe very first roses in Rapperswil blossom at the Breny tower and at the Stadtpfarrkirche Rapperswil next to the Schloss Rapperswil because their medieval sandstone walls are exposed to the sun all through the year.\n\nUnder the patronage of the transport association (\"Verkehrsverein\") Rapperswil-Jona, the museum was established in 1943 as \"Heimatmuseum lokaler Geschichte und Kunst\" (museum of local history and art). As a legacy of the sisters Paulina and Henrika Breny, the buildings, as of today commonly called \"Breny-Haus\" and \"Breny-Turm\", are situated at former \"Obere Halsgasse\", and administrated by the city of Rapperswil. In 2008, some Rapperswil residents petitioned local authorities to evict the Polish Museum from its home in the Rapperswil Castle, as two historical museum locations (\"Stadtmuseum\" and Polish Museum) estimated to be too expensive. The Polish Museum is conducting a petition campaign to retain the Museum in the castle; \"Stadtmuseum\" will be kept respectively in 2010/11 renewed at its actual location.\n\nIn December 2009, the project \"Janus\" presented the results of an evaluation for public vote by the citizens of Rapperswil-Jona. The city museum will be renewed from January 2010 to autumn 2011, and therefore will be closed for visitors. Its historical intermediate section between Breny house and Breny tower will probably replaced by a purposive construction integrated into the historic street-scape between \"Stadtpfarrkirche\" (parish church) and \"Engelplatz\" square. This new building serves both, as an exhibition space as well as connection between the two historical museum buildings. The formative north side of the town walls will be kept as it is. Investment and operating costs of around 5.6 million Swiss francs will be borne equally between local community and political community Rapperswil-Jona. Simultaneously with the realization of the project, the accumulated maintenance work on the facades, windows and roofs of the historic buildings and the town wall will be done.\n\nAlong with temporary exhibits, main sights are the prehistoric and Roman archaeological finds, particularly from the extensive excavations at Kempraten, the former Roman \"vicus Centum Prata\". Other exhibits are medieval coat of arms of the city of Rapperswil, a goblet of Countess Elizabeth of Rapperswil, the late Gothic living hall and religious goldsmiths, including the mitre, the crosier, particulate monstrance from the monastery treasury of Premonstratensian Rüti Abbey. The intermediate section (as of October 2009) is home to the Breny and Göldli rooms with antique portraits from the Renaissance, the Curti room of Rapperswil silk merchants from the 15th century and the Greith room. In the Breny tower there are a scale model of the city of Rapperswil showing the city as it was in 1800, further information on history and the city fortifications as well as examples of medieval weapons, pharmacy, shoe-making and kiln ceramics from Rapperswil.\n\nThe previous conventional presentation of the collection objects was replaced in 2012/12 by a multimedia \"history experience\", i.e., by visual and audible interaction with the visitors.\n\nThe building is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a \"Class B\" object of regional importance.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4792288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4792288", "title": "Sun Temple, Modhera", "text": "Sun Temple, Modhera\n\nThe Sun Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the solar deity Surya located at Modhera village of Mehsana district, Gujarat, India. It is situated on the bank of the river Pushpavati. It was built after 1026-27 CE during the reign of Bhima I of the Chaulukya dynasty. No worship is offered now and is protected monument maintained by Archaeological Survey of India. The temple complex has three components: \"Gudhamandapa\", the shrine hall; \"Sabhamandapa\", the assembly hall and \"Kunda\", the reservoir. The halls have intricately carved exterior and pillars. The reservoir has steps to reach bottom and numerous small shrines.\n\nThe shrine proper of the Sun Temple was built during the reign of Bhima I of Chaulukya dynasty. Earlier, during 1024-25, Mahmud of Ghazni had invaded Bhima's kingdom, and a force of around 20,000 soldiers had unsuccessfully tried to check his advance at Modhera. Historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes that the Sun Temple might have been built to commemorate this defence. On a block in western wall of cella, there is an inscription \"Vikram Samvat 1083\" upside down carelessly incised in Devnagari script which correspond to 1026-1027 CE. No other date is found. As the inscription is upside down, it evidences the destruction and reconstruction of the cella. Due to position of the inscription, it is not firmly considered as the date of construction. On the stylistic ground, it is known that the \"kunda\" with its corner shrines was built earlier in the beginning of the 11th century. The inscription is rather considered as the date of destruction by Ghazni instead of the construction. Soon after Bhima had returned to the power. So the temple proper, the miniature and the niche shrines in the tank was built shortly after 1026 CE. The dancing hall was added much later in the third quarter of the 12th century along with the gateways, the porch of the temple proper and the doorframes of the temple and the cella during the reign of the Karna.\n\nThe temple is built on 23.6° latitude (approximately near Tropic of Cancer). The place was later known as \"Sita ni Chauri\" and \"Ramkund\" locally. No worship is offered here now. The temple is Monument of National Importance and is maintained by Archeological Survey of India.\n\nThe temple complex is built in Maru-Gurjara style (Chaulukya style). The temple complex has three axially aligned components; the shrine proper (\"garbhagriha\") in a hall (\"gudhamandapa\"), the outer or assembly hall (\"sabhamandapa\" or \"rangamandapa\") and a sacred reservoir (\"kunda\").\n\nThe \"sabhamandapa\" is not in continuation with \"gudhamandapa\" but is placed little away as a separate structure. Both are built on paved platform. Their roofs have collapsed long ago leaving behind few lower-most courses. Both roofs are 15' 9\" in diameter but are constructed differently. The platform or plinth is inverted lotus shaped.\n\nThe \"Gudhamandapa\" measures 51 feet 9 inches by 25 feet 8 inches. It is almost equally divided into \"Gudhamandapa\", the hall and \"garbhgriha\", the shrine proper. Both are rectangular in plan with one projection on each of the smaller sides and two projections on each of the longer sides. This projections on the smaller sides form the entrance and the back of shrine. The three projections of outer wall of \"Gudhamandapa\" had windows on each side and the east projection had the doorway. These windows had perforated stone screens; the northern is in ruins and the southern is missing. \"Pradakshinamarga\" is formed by the passage between the walls of \"garbhgriha\" and the outer walls of \"gudhamandapa\". The roof of passage has stones slabs carved with rosettes. The \"Shikhara\" of the it no longer exists.\n\nThe \"Garbhagriha\", the shrine proper or sanctum sanctorum is square measuring 11 feet from inside.\n\nThe shrine had two cells; a cell below the level of upper cell. The floor of upper cell is now fallen which once housed the image of deity. The seat of image is now in pit. The lower cell was probably used for storage.\n\nThe walls inside shrine is plain and outer wall is decorated. The doorway has carved figures of seated Surya in panels surrounded by dancers and amorous couples. All figures are mutilated and the images on the door-lintel is completely destroyed.\n\nThe sanctum sanctorum is designed in a way that the first rays of rising sun lit up the image of Surya during solar equinox days and on summer solstice day, the sun shines directly above the temple at noon casting no shadow.\n\nThe outer walls of shrine is highly decorated.\nThe base and walls of the shrine and hall are divided into several stretches with unique carvings. the \"pitha\" or \"adhisthana\", base has the two square members called \"bhat\" followed by a cymarecta carving (lower part convex and upper part concave). It is followed by \"padma\" or \"padmaka\", the moulding in form of inverted lotus. The next is \"antarita\", a fillet or an astragal with a sharp edge between two recesses. Above this is \"patta\" having thin moulding called \"chhaja\" at its lower edge. The next is another \"chhaja\" separated by neck, \"alinga\". The next broad band, \"patti\", is \"gajathara\" carved with elephants. The following band \"narathara\" has figures of men in different attitudes.\n\n\"Mandovara\", the wall mouldings starts with \"kumbha\", a pitcher. It has a broad undecorated band at lower part while middle part is decorated with oval discs. It is followed by \"kalasha\", a pitcher. The next is broad band with \"chaitya\"-windows called \"kevala\" followed by similar called \"manchi\". These two bands are separated by a deep band. There is a thin fillet above which the major paneled face of wall called \"jangha\" exist. This panels are decorated with figures of gods but the figures of Surya are placed prominently than others as the temple is dedicated to him. Other panels are decorated with dancers and other figures.\n\nThe figures of Surya are prominently carved on three niches of shrine proper as well as on the each side of three windows in the outer wall of \"Gudhamandapa\". The figures of Surya is in standing position with two arms holding lotuses and driven by seven horses. It has some Persian influences. The walls have 12 niches showing the different aspects of Surya in each month. Other figures include eight Dikpals, Vishwakarma, Varuna, Agni, Ganesha, Saraswati.\n\nEvery figure in panel has a small cornice over it surmounted with triangular pediment consisting of \"chaitya\"-window which is called \"udgam\". The next projecting band with \"chaitya\"-window and \"kirtimukha\" is called \"malakval\". The top most is the major cornice called \"chhajli\".\n\nThis is followed by \"shikhara\" which no longer exist. The \"Vimana\" had horizontal geometrical and figurative bands which rising to create the Mount Meru-like \"shikhara\". The central spire had \"Urushringa\", the miniature shrines. It is judged by the shrines on the steps of \"Kunda\".\n\nThe \"Mandapa\", a hall was roofed by a dome which probably rose in concentric manner. It is supported by eight principal pillars below arranged in an octagon, four pillars in front of shrine proper and two each in the recesses of windows and door.\n\n\"Sabhamandapa\" or \"Rangamandapa\", the assembly hall or dancing hall is parallelogram in plan with rows of pillars opening entrance on each side diagonally. The extensively carved exterior has series of recessed corners giving impression of the star like plan of it. There are 52 intricately carved pillars. Madhusudan Dhaky has suggested that the \"sabhamandapa\" may has been later addition based on style and construction.\n\nThe \"pitha\" is almost similar to the \"Gudhamandapa\" but smaller as two courses of fillets are omitted. The \"padma\" is carved richly here with floral ornamentation.\n\nAbove the \"Narathara\", there is a band with figures of dancers and gods known as \"rajasena\". The next is \"vedi\" which correspond to \"jangha\" of \"mandovara\" decorated with large panels of gods, goddesses and floral designs. The next is cornice called \"asinot\". It followed by \"kakshasana\" which slopes outwards and forms the back-rests of the bench, \"asana\" which runs round the hall. There are erotic figures on it interrupted by rail-patterns.\n\nThe roof was in shape of stepped pyramid but it no longer exists. Inside, the walnut-shaped ceiling rises in tiers which has numerous floral girdles. It is 23 feet high. It is supported by pillars arranged in an octagon. These pillars have stilts which supports the lintels. \"Torana\" or the decorated cusped arches arise from the lower brackets of the pillars and touch the lintels in middle. There are two types; semicircular and triangular. The semicircular arches has cusped arches with tips while triangular arches has round apex and wavy sides. Both types has broad band decorated with figures and tips which are now defaced and damaged. The lower brackets has \"makara\" which gives the name of \"makara-torana\" while decoration gives name of \"chitra-torana\".\n\nThe pillars of \"Sabhamandapa\" and \"Gudhamandapa\" are of two types; short and tall. The short pillars rests on walls and supports the roof. The tall pillars rise from the floor.\n\nThe shaft is square in shape till half of its height followed by vase and then followed by octagonal shaft. It is surmounted by a capital and a bracket. The square part has floral design in circle on each side of faces. The vase is decorated similarly on its corners. The octagonal part have four bands; the top most has \"kirtimukha\". The capital has three annulets.\n\nThey arise from square or octagonal base, \"kumbhi\", with triangular ornamentation on each face. Above it is \"kalasha\". It is followed by a deep band and the next is \"kevala\" decorated with \"chaitya\"-windows. the next is \"kirtimukha\". The next is triangular pediment with \"chaitya\"-windows.\n\nThe next is beginning of shaft. It is first decorated with standing figures, mostly dancers, on all eight faces enclosed in ringed pilasters. The next band with scenes of men and beasts is separated from it by round pillow-like band. It is followed by still smaller band with sixteen standing human figures separated by small annultet below. The next is band of leaves. Then the shaft becomes circular and had three or four bands having row of male warriors, lozenges, circles and \"kirtimukha\" at last. The \"kirtimukha\"s are separated by chain and bell ornamentation.\n\nIt follows capital similar to small pillars crowned with \"makara\" brackets if eight stilted pillar and dwarfs in the rests. the eight stilted pillars have one more shaft and similar type of capital which is crowned with brackets of volutes and pendant leaves.\n\nThe panels on the \"Gudhamandapa\" is decorated with Surya centrally which indicates that the temple is dedicated to Surya. These images wears peculiar West Asian (Persian) boots and belt. The other corners and niches are decorated with figures of Shiva and Vishnu in various forms, Brahma, Nāga and goddesses. The depicted scenes on small flat ceilings and lintels of \"sabhamandapa\" are from epics like Ramayana.\n\nThere was a \"kirti-torana\", the triumphant arch, in front of \"sabhamandapa\". The pediment and \"torana\" no longer exists but two pillars remains. The moulding and decoration is similar to that of walls of \"sabhamandapa\" and pillars. There were two more \"kirti-torana\" on each side of the \"kunda\" of which only one exists without upper part.\n\n\"Kunda\", a tank or reservoir is known as \"Ramakunda\" or \"Suryakunda\". The flight of steps through \"kirti-torana\" leads to the reservoir. It is rectangular. It measures 176 feet from north to south and 120 feet from east to west. It is paved with stones all around. There are four terraces and recessed steps to descend to reach the bottom of the tank. The main entrance lies on west. There are steps to reach from one terrace to another on right angle to terrace. These steps are rectangular or square except the first step of each flight of steps which is semicircular. Several miniature shrines and niches in front of terrace-wall have images of gods including many Vaishnavite deities and goddesses such as Shitala.\n\nThe stepwell on the west of \"Kunda\" has one entrance and two pavilion-towers. It is moderately ornamented. The door-frame has lotus and leaves and the \"ruchaka\" type pilasters indicate it belongs to 11th century. The small \"mandapa\" above the ground level and located on the second \"kuta\" of stepwell may belong to 10th century.\n\nThe Tourism Corporation of Gujarat organises an annual three-day dance festival known as 'Uttarardha Mahotsav' at the temple during the third week of January, following the festival of Uttarayan. The objective is to present classical dance forms in an atmosphere similar to that in which they were originally presented.\n\nIt is located in Modhera village which is 25 km from Mehsana and 106 km from Ahmedabad in Gujarat India.\n\nLetitia Elizabeth Landon's poetical illustration \"Hindoo and Mahommedan Buildings\" refers to an illustration of \"a splendid sculptured Portico of a Temple dedicated to Mahadeo, at Moondheyra in Guzerat\" and in it she meditates upon the vastness of this structure.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15257268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15257268", "title": "The Dark Lady Players", "text": "The Dark Lady Players\n\nThe Dark Lady Players are a New York-based Shakespeare company who perform what they regard as the religious allegories in the Shakespearean plays. In 2007 they performed an allegorical production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" at the Abingdon Theater in New York. In 2008 they performed \"As You Like It: The Big Flush\", directed by Stephen Wisker, at the Midtown International Theatre Festival with an entirely female cast interspersing Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" with \"cultural and literary references\" believed to be included by Amelia Bassano Lanier. On December 15, 2009 they produced a festival at Manhattan Theater Source of short plays written about Lanier by nine New York City playwrights. In September 2011 they presented \"nine scenes from Shakespeare, divided into three thematic groups and casts\" in the West-Park Presbyterian Church in Upper West Side.\n\nMany scholars have noted religious allegories and references in Shakespeare's plays. For example, quotations from the Bible are used in 3,000 places as shown by professor Naseeb Shaheen, and 14 different translations are used. In a few places the playwright has translated the Book of Genesis using the original Hebrew. In addition, there are many other church and religious references. For example, in 1999 in his study of \"Julius Caesar\", Professor Steve Sohmer argues that the playwright \"set out to interrogate the truth of the Gospels\". Similarly in 1988 Linda Hoff posited that \"Hamlet\" is entirely a religious allegory. According to the study by Peter Milward, \"King Lear\", \"Antony and Cleopatra\", \"Hamlet\", \"Richard III\", \"Henry VIII\" all include detailed Apocalypse allegories.\n\nElizabethan literature routinely used allegories to communicate hidden meanings. Contemporary literary critics advised that instead of feasting on the verse, readers should look beneath the surface to \"digest the allegory\", as Sir John Harington put it in the introduction to his translation of Orlando Furioso. State Decipherers sitting in audiences attempted to detect hidden meanings in the plays being staged, as recorded by Ben Jonson.\n\nDark Lady Players was founded by John Hudson, a Shakespeare scholar most notable for his advocacy of the theory that the works of Shakespeare were written by Emilia Bassano Lanier. Hudson received a graduate degree from the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham, and is currently the artistic director of the Dark Lady Players.\n\nIn 2007 the Dark Lady Players performed an allegorical production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream\" at the Abingdon Theater in New York. The allegory was based on work by Professor Patricia Parker in her article 'Murals and Morals; A Midsummer Night's Dream' (1998). She believes that Pyramus and Thisbe were an allegory for Jesus and the Church, the Wall is the Partition that comes down on the day of Apocalypse, Peter Quince is Saint Peter, and Puck is the Devil. In addition, the production used work by John Hudson, in his 2008 thesis at the Shakespeare Institute of the University of Birmingham, to show the allegorical identity of all the other characters. The result was a consistent religious allegory—but one that was Jewish in nature rather than Christian—because it ends with a Jewish Apocalypse featuring a dew blessing, after the comic re-union in Quince's play-within-the-play ended in the deaths of both protagonists.\n\nIn 2008 the Dark Lady Players performed two different versions of \"As You Like It\", which draws on the allegory hypothesized by Richard Knowles. The workshop production was directed by Greeman as part of the Shakespeare Symposium at ManhattanTheaterSource. The subsequent production in summer 2008 at the Midtown International Theatre Festival was directed by the Stephen Wisker. A film was made for Manhattan cable television on the production. The work was presented at Eastern Connecticut State University on 11 November 2009, and their lecture Who Wrote Shakespeare? is available at the University website. On 15 December 2009 at Manhattan Theater Source they produced a festival of short plays written about Amelia Lanier by nine New York City playwrights. Playwright Bella Poynton was the festival winner, and then commissioned by the company to write a full-length play detailing Lanier's life.\n\nIn September 2009 the Dark Lady Players produced a piece titled \"Shakespeare's Three Virgin Marys\", which examined the allegorical Mary figures identified in the academic literature by researchers such as Chris Hassel, Linda Hoff, and Steve Sohmer. Extracts from the production were featured in a TV news feature on the Dark Lady Players that was broadcast on The Jewish Channel on September 11, 2009. The Dark Lady Players produced Hamlet's Apocalypse, an allegorical version of Hamlet in November 2010 at Manhattan Theatre Source in Greenwich Village.\n\nIn 2011, the company performed a site-specific museum-style tour of \"Shakespeare's Gospel Parodies\", subtitled \"A Medieval Mystery Tour\" at The Center at West-Park Church, in repertory with the Woodshed Collective's The Tenant. The show featured docents, played by actors, who led audience members on tours through 12 scenes from Shakespeare. In 2012 the DLP presented a one-night lecture event on Shakespeare's Annunciation Parodies, featuring scenes from \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Twelfth Night\", \"Hamlet\", and \"Othello\". The Dark Lady Players entered an ensemble piece roughly titled \"Shakespeare Flash Mob\" for the 2012 Figment Festival and performed a full-length original play by Bella Poynton, \"Midsummer Madness\", in August 2012 at the Central Park Bandshell. In 2014 the company is performing a version of Othello that suggests the Emilia character is an allegory for Amelia Bassano Lanier, as described in an article in Howlround (http://www.howlround.com/a-new-approach-to-othello-shakespeares-dark-lady). IN March 2014 Amberley Publishing is releasing a book \"Shakespeare's Dark Lady\" which argues the case for Lanier's authorship of these plays as Jewish satires. An advance review in Kirkus Reviews on February 6, 2014 describes it as 'Well-researched, fascinating and thought-provoking' (www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-hudson/shakespeares-dark-lady-amelia-bassano-lanier/ ). However, Hudson's theories have not been widely accepted by Shakespeare scholars.\n\nCurrent company members include Alexandra Cohler, Mimi Hirt, Elizabeth Weitzen, Emily Hyman, Shykia Fields, Petra Denison and Bella Poynton.\n\n\n\n"}

Recent statistical research released in November 2015, entitled \"The Count\", gathered that 22% of total surveyed professional productions from 2011-2013 annual seasons were written by women playwrights, 3.8% of the total were written by women playwrights of color, and 0.4% of the total were written by foreign women playwrights of color. 78% of total surveyed professional productions were written by men playwrights.\n\nFirst released in June 2014, The list is an annual collection of highly recommended contemporary plays written by female and trans* identified authors, which are read or seen by an industry professional within the last twelve months. The list was established by \"The Kilroys\", a group of Los Angeles-based female-identified playwrights and producers who were tired of their plays remaining unproduced while artistic directors claimed \"We chose the best plays\" for their theater companies' annual seasons. The namesake of \"The Kilroys\" originated from the World War II graffiti tag, \"Kilroy Was Here.\" The tagline for \"The Kilroys\" is \"We Make Trouble and Plays.\" The Kilroys members include: Zakiyyah Alexander, Bekah Brunstetter, Sheila Callaghan, Carla Ching, Annah Feinberg, Sarah Gubbins, Laura Jacqmin, Joy Meads, Kelly Miller, Meg Miroshnik, Daria Polatin, Tanya Saracho, and Marisa Wegrzyn.\n\nIn 2014 the list featured the Top 46, a collection of 46 plays highly recommended by selected Nominators. The Nominators consisted of a number of contemporary theater artists and administrators currently working in the theater industry.\n\nThe 2015 List: The top 7% featured 53 plays.\n\nTo qualify as eligible for The List, a play must be:\n\nGender Parity is a term that has grown to widespread popularity in the theater industry in recent years. There have been several initiatives started to address the underrepresentation of, and discrimination against, women and trans* artists and administrators. Much of this work has been statistical research based on numbers of women and trans* artists and administrators filing roles within a theater organization's staff and theatrical season.\n\nConsidered the most recent statistical research and analysis on gender disparity, \"The Count\" was founded by playwrights and co-founders of the \"Lilly Awards\", Marsha Norman and Julia Jordan, and Rebecca Stump of the Dramatists Guild. This research was presented at the annual \"Lilly Awards\" in July 2015 and published in November 2015 by the |Dramatists Guild.\n\nTheaters that were eligible for survey must be not-for-profit and regional, including Off-Broadway and Off-Off Broadway. Broadway theaters were not included in the survey. In total, 153 theater companies' 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014 seasons were included in the national survey.\n\nJulia Jordan has been quoted saying, \"We wanted to create a baseline and to document the change.\" This baseline consists of percentage breakdowns based on the coined terms\",\" \"Unique Writers,\" which allows each individual produced writer to be counted once within the data, and \"Unique Productions,\" which allows each individual production of a writer's play to be counted once within the data. For instance, while Lynn Nottage is considered a \"Unique Writer,\" each production of her play \"Intimate Apparel\" would be considered a \"Unique Production.\" Within these categories, \"The Count\" measured representations based on the playwright's self-identified intersections of race, gender, and nationality. These percentages can be seen below in ascending order of percentage: \nIn addition, \"The Count\" included percentage breakdowns by a U.S. regional map and by individual city. Selected cities consisted of:\n\nThe Count will continue to be updated on an annual basis.\n\nOne of the first initial statistical research and analyses on \"gender disparity\" was an honors research project completed by, then Princeton undergraduate student, Emily Glassberg Sands titled, \"Opening the Curtain on Playwright Gender: An Integrated Economic Analysis of Discrimination in American Theater\".\n\nAfter what has become known as \"the Summit\"—a gathering of artistic directors and artists in Washington D.C., when an artistic director made a controversial comment about no plays by women in the American theater industry \"pipeline\"—the We Exist google document was created to document the names of women and trans* identified playwrights across the world.\n\nOther gender parity initiatives include Theatre Communications Group's \"82 Theatre Companies With Playwriting Parity\" \"(and Better)\", published by American Theatre Magazine in September 2015. In addition, there have been formations of citywide Women's Playwriting Festivals such as the 2015 \"D.C. Women's Voices Theater Festival\", which produced 56 new plays by women at 51 theaters across the greater D.C. area, and city-based Gender Parity Task Force Groups. There has also been increased scholarship in uncovering plays by women, for instance Susan Jones's \"The Other Canon\", a list of plays by women that date back 10 centuries.\n\nIn addition, there are annual theater awards for recognition of contemporary women playwrights such as the \"Lilly Awards\", named after playwright Lillian Hellman, which was founded in 2010 by playwrights Marsha Norman, Julia Jordan]], and Theresa Rebeck]], as well as theater companies dedicated to producing work written and directed by women such as the Women's Project Theater.\n\nFor the 2015 List, the \"Kilroys\" partnered with the National New Play Network for their online database, the New Play Exchange. The exchange allows playwrights to create accounts to include their professional work in the form sample pages or full-length plays. The website is an initiative to address how professional theaters can use a more efficient selection process to determine which plays will be produced for their annual seasons. In previous years, \"There had been hundreds of conversations about how the submission model was broken, how people filled their offices and built furniture out of unread scripts, how playwrights waited for years to hear back about the plays they just knew were perfect.\"\n\nIn addition to uploading samples pages or full length pages of scripts and musical scores, playwrights can include information on casting breakdowns, keywords, and past production history. Anyone can create profiles to find playwrights, to read and privately evaluate plays, build a \"private library,\" and \"watch\" others on the New Play Exchange as they add more to their profiles. It will serve as a \"tool for students, audiences, and new play lovers everywhere to access new works. It will serve organizations so that they can let playwrights know what they are looking to read, to develop, and to produce.\"\n\nThe \"Kilroys' List\" has been covered nationwide in newspapers and other online media sources. After the 2014 list was released, the Kilroys were determined to expand the nominating pool \"to increase [writer] representation along class, ability, sexual orientation, and gender lines (including genderqueer, trans*, and other non-binary gender identities).\"\n\nIn June 2015, American Theatre Magazine wrote, \"The impact of that initial list is hard to measure precisely, particularly given the long lead times of some theatres’ season planning, but the Kilroys have reported that 28 of the original 47 plays have since been produced, and individual writers cited on the list have reported more interest and requests for their scripts, if not a spate of production commitments.\" In addition, there have been publicly promoted initiatives to utilize the lists, including a reading series of 3 selected plays from the 2014 List, hosted by the \"Lilly Awards\". Also, playwright Sheila Callaghan is quoted in American Theatre Magazine saying, “A school is doing a class on just the Kilroys plays...That’s part of the movement, too.”\n"}

A co-production between the BBC and the Open University, the series looks at the impact the World Wide Web has had since its inception 20 years ago. The series took a different approach to BBC documentary making by encouraging an open and collaborative production.\n\nThe series was announced on 10 July 2009, under the working title of \"Digital Revolution\", to examine the impact the World Wide Web has had on society over its first 20 years. Technology journalist and academic Aleks Krotoski would present. The series was launched with an event at the BBC to mark the twentieth anniversary of the World Wide Web, which saw Tim Berners-Lee (credited with inventing the World Wide Web), Susan Greenfield, Bill Thompson and Chris Anderson discuss the World Wide Web.\n\nThe production team took a different approach to the development of the series, described by series producer Russell Barnes as \"radical\" and \"open-source\": \"We don't just want to observe bloggers from on high; we want to blog ourselves and get feedback and comment on our ideas.\" He described the four phases the production would take; firstly conducting interviews and inviting comments from users on the programme's blog, the second would see rushes released for others to re-use under a permissive license, thirdly, web users would be engaged, working with the Web Science Research Initiative, and the fourth would be an online, interactive version of the series available after it has finished.\n\nThe programme team interviewed a number of people who have played a part in the development of the web, including its inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee and founders of notable brands; Bill Gates (Microsoft), Steve Wozniak (Apple), Chad Hurley (YouTube), Jimmy Wales (Wikipedia), Stewart Brand (The WELL), Biz Stone and Evan Williams (Twitter), Peter Thiel (PayPal) and Martha Lane Fox (lastminute.com). Academics, including Terry Winograd, Sherry Turkle, A. C. Grayling, David Runciman, Ross Anderson and Nigel Shadbolt, commentators, including David Weinberger, Lee Siegel, Douglas Rushkoff, Andrew Keen and Stephen Fry, and Estonian President Toomas Ilves were also interviewed. Footage of the interviews was also made available on the programme's website.\n\nIn October 2009 and while being interviewed for the series, Stephen Fry made a request on Twitter for people to suggest names for the series, with the final decision being made by the BBC. The chosen title, \"The Virtual Revolution\", is described by the producers as \"a mashup between us and you\".\n\nOvernight estimates indicated that 1.2 million people watched the first episode, a 5% audience share.\n\nIn reviewing the first episode, Tom Sutcliffe in \"The Independent\", \"glad\" the programme contained the \"odd sceptic too\", said Krotoski was a \"fine presenter\" that the series was both \"premature and overdue\":\n\nPremature because when you're in the middle of a forest fire you can have no sensible idea of how it will eventually burn out. Overdue, because the flames have been raging for 15 years now and it's excellent that the BBC is at last sticking a dampened finger in the air to see which direction the wind is blowing.\n\nFor \"The Times\", Andrew Billen gave the first episode three out of five, saying that Krotoski \"offered paradox and dialectic before reaching her bland conclusion that the web was constantly re-inventing itself\". \"The Guardian\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Tim Dowling said that the first episode \"made a better fist of it than most\" and that \"the contributors struck a nice balance between big name cheerleaders and glowering dissenters\". He described Krotoski as \"convincingly authoritative\" but found that \"the big picture was sometimes hard to hold in your head\" and \"the term 'empowering tool' was deployed frequently but without enlightenment\". Ryan Lambie for Den of Geek said that \"the phrases 'empowering tool' and 'ultimate leveller' are repeated far too many times\" and that \"the programme's makers apparently assume that the average viewer has never seen or used the Internet in their life\", but felt Krotoski was \"engaging and enthusiastic\" as host, however \"her constant presence in every other shot is strangely distracting\". \"The Scotsman\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Paul Whitelaw, who also said the camera was \"fixated on Krotoski\", felt the first programme was a \"disjointed essay which proved fascinating when focusing on the origins of the web, but less so when dealing with more recent and familiar developments\".\n\nThe series won the 2010 Digital Emmy for Best Digital Program: Non-Fiction and the 2010 BAFTA television award for New Media.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7058356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7058356", "title": "Twentieth-century theatre", "text": "Twentieth-century theatre\n\nTwentieth-century theatre describes a period of great change within the theatrical culture of the 20th century, mainly in Europe and North America. There was a widespread challenge to long-established rules surrounding theatrical representation; resulting in the development of many new forms of theatre, including modernism, Expressionism, Impressionism, political theatre and other forms of Experimental theatre, as well as the continuing development of already established theatrical forms like naturalism and realism.\n\nThroughout the century, the artistic reputation of theatre improved after being derided throughout the 19th century. However, the growth of other media, especially film, has resulted in a diminished role within the culture at large. In light of this change, theatrical artists have been forced to seek new ways to engage with society. The various answers offered in response to this have prompted the transformations that make up its modern history.\n\nDevelopments in areas like Gender theory and postmodern philosophy identified and created subjects for the theatre to explore. These sometimes explicitly meta-theatrical performances were meant to confront the audience's perceptions and assumptions in order to raise questions about their society. These challenging and influential plays characterized much of the final two decades of the 20th-century.\n\nAlthough largely developing in Europe and North America through the beginning of the century, the next 50 years saw an embrace of non-Western theatrical forms. Influenced by the dismantling of empires and the continuing development of post-colonial theory, many new artists utilized elements of their own cultures and societies to create a diversified theatre.\n\nRealism focuses on the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions or implausible, exotic and supernatural elements. For many theatre artists throughout the century, realism was meant to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life.\n\nInfluenced by the ideas of Sigmund Freud, Charles Darwin and others, many artists began to find a psychological approach to theatre that emphasized the inner dimensions of the characters onstage. This was carried out both on the stage in acting styles, in play writing and in theatrical design. Beginning with the work Russian playwrights Ivan Turgenev, Alexander Ostrovsky and Leo Tolstoy and continued by Emile Zola in France and Henrik Ibsen in Norway in the late 19th Century, realism came to dominate most of the theatrical culture of the 20th century in Britain and North America.\n\nIn Russia, the movement towards realism began earlier than anywhere else in the world. Building on the work of earlier pioneers, Constantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko founded the Moscow Art Theatre in 1898, wanting to reform a Russian theatre dominated by melodrama to one in which high-quality art was available to the general public. In perhaps the most important theatrical meeting of the 20th century, the two met for an epic 18-hours, from 2 pm to 8 am the next morning, and laid the foundation for one of the most influential companies of the century. Together they would forge a professional company with an ensemble ethos that discouraged individual vanity, selecting actors from Nemirovich's class at the Philharmonic school and Stanislavsky's amateur Society of Art and Literature group, along with other professional actors; they would create a realistic theatre of international renown, with popular prices for seats, whose organically unified aesthetic would bring together the techniques of the Meiningen Ensemble and those of André Antoine's Théâtre Libre (which Stanislavsky had seen during trips to Paris).\n\nOn December 29, 1898, the theatre opened Anton Chekhov's The Seagull with Stanislavski himself playing the role of Trigorin and Vsevolod Meyerhold as Treplev in \"one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest developments in the history of world drama.\" Nemirovich described the applause, which came after a prolonged silence, as bursting from the audience like a dam breaking and the production received unanimous praise from the press. Later analysts attribute the production's success to the fidelity of its delicate representation of everyday life, its intimate, ensemble playing, and the resonance of its mood of despondent uncertainty with the psychological disposition of the Russian intelligentsia of the time. Productions of Ibsen, Shakespeare, and Chekhov's Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard and Three Sisters were also very successful in the early days of the company.\n\nAfter the success of the Moscow Art Theatre, Stanislavski set out to create a unified system of acting that would train actors and actresses to create believable characterizations for their performances. Developed mainly between 1911 and 1916 and revised throughout his life, the approach was partly based on the concept of emotional memory for which an actor focuses internally to portray a character's emotions onstage. Areas of study include concentration, voice, physical skills, emotion memory, observation, and dramatic analysis. The Stanislavsky system was widely practiced in the Soviet Union and in the United States, where experiments in its use began in the 1920s and continued in many schools and professional workshops.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Russia experienced a cultural Silver Age and the theatre was no exception. By 1916, the total number of producing theatres in Moscow alone totaled close to 200. These year-round and seasonal theatres produced mainly farces, comedies, vaudevilles and even melodramas, but there were also a significant number of theatres offering realistic or naturalistic theatre. These included Aleksey Suvorin's Maly Theatre and the Moscow Dramatic Theatre (1914–19). While there were a number of actress-managers in St. Petersburg and Moscow like Vera Komissarzhevskaya and Ida Rubinstein, the course of Russian theatre in the Silver Age was largely dominated by men.\n\nAfter the First World War and the Russian Revolution, many theatre artists left Russia for other countries, including Georges Pitoëff to France, Theodore Komisarjevsky to Britain, and, famously, Mikhael Chekhov to the United States, exporting the Stanislavski system and contributing to the development of a 'director's theatre' in the post-war world.\n\nIn the United States, William Vaughn Moody's plays \"The Great Divide\" (1906) and \"The Faith Healer\" (1909) pointed the way to a more realistic American drama in their emphasis on the emotional conflicts that lie at the heart of contemporary social conflicts. Other key playwrights signaling the move to realism in the beginning of the century include Edward Sheldon, Charles Rann Kennedy and Rachel Crothers. Onstage, the American theatre was dominated by the Barrymore family: Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore (the \"First Lady of American Theater\") and John Barrymore (\"... the most influential and idolized actor of his day.\"). They were so popular that a play was even written about them: The Royal Family by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, a parody of the Barrymores, with particular aim taken at John and Ethel Barrymore.\n\nThrough the early century, no American dramatist had as much influence on the development of drama as Eugene O'Neill. Born into the theatre from a young age, he spent much of his youth on trains and backstage at theatres, before developing his talent with the Provincetown Players in New York City. Between 1916 and 1920, he wrote several plays for the company before debuting his first critical hit \"Beyond the Horizon\" in 1920, which went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. He followed that with critical and commercial successes, including \"The Emperor Jones\", \"Anna Christie\" (Pulitzer Prize 1922), \"Desire Under the Elms\" (1924), \"Strange Interlude\" (Pulitzer Prize 1928), \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" (1931), \"The Iceman Cometh\" (1939) and his only well-known comedy, \"Ah, Wilderness!\". After his death, his magnum opus and masterwork \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" was published and is often regarded to be one of the finest American plays of the 20th century.\n\nThe economic crisis of the Great Depression led to the creation of the Federal Theatre Project (1935–39), a New Deal program which funded theatre and other live artistic performances throughout the country. National director Hallie Flanagan shaped the project into a federation of regional theatres that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and made it possible for millions of Americans to see theatre for the first time. The project directly employed 15,000 men and women and played 1,200 productions to nearly 30 million people in 200 theatres nationwide, with 65% being presented free of charge, at a total cost of $46 million.\n\nKey figures of the early century include George S. Kaufman, George Kelly, Langston Hughes, S. N. Behrman, Sidney Howard, Robert E. Sherwood, and a set of playwrights who followed O'Neill's path of philosophical searching, Philip Barry, Thornton Wilder and William Saroyan.\n\nModernism was a predominantly European movement that developed as a self-conscious break from traditional art forms. It represents a significant shift in cultural sensibilities, often attributed to the fallout of World War I. At first, the modernist theatre was in large part an attempt to realize the reformed stage on naturalistic principles as advocated by Émile Zola in the 1880s. However, a simultaneous reaction against naturalism urged the theatre in a much different direction. Owing much to symbolism, the movement attempted to integrate poetry, painting, music, and dance in a harmonious fusion. Both of these seemingly conflicting movements fit under the term 'Modernism'.\n\nPolitical theatre is an attempt to rethink the nature and function of theatre in the light of the dynamics of the society outside it and audience involvement within it. It led to profound and original theories of acting, staging and playwriting.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, many viewed theatre as an \"all-too-popular affair.\" Frequently, the true reformers of the early part of the century called for increasingly smaller theatres, where their techniques could register on a select audience. Still, these same practitioners often dreamed that their art would be a true people's theatre: a theatre for the people. Inspired by an understanding of the Greek theatre and heavily influenced by Nietzsche, they sought a profound or ecstatic ritual event that involved music and movement, in a space without a proscenium arch. Later, practitioners like Vsevolod Meyerhold and Bertolt Brecht would initiate an attempt to bridge the \"gulf\" between modernism and the people.\n\nIn popular musical theatre there have been different trends and phases of commercial success, including works of the following:\n\n\nPost-modern theatre is a recent phenomenon in world theatre, coming as it does out of the postmodern philosophy that originated in Europe in the middle of the 20th century. Post-modern theatre emerged as a reaction against modernist theatre. Most post-modern productions are centered around highlighting the fallibility of definite truth, instead encouraging the audience to reach their own individual understanding. Essentially, thus, post-modern theatre raises questions rather than attempting to supply answers.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th-century, many European audiences were exposed to the \"exotic\" theatrical world of Japanese and Chinese performances. This led to many Western practitioners interpreting and incorporating these styles into their own theatres: most notably Bertolt Brecht's adaptation of Chinese opera to support his 'Alienation' effect. The influence of the non-western theatre on theatrical culture in the 20th-century has often been crucial to new developments. However, the period during and after the advent of post-colonial theory in the 1960s and 1970s, has led to a tremendous amount of development in theatre practice all over the world. This has created, for the first time, a truly global theatre.\n\nSignificant figures and some landmark theories and movements of the period include:\n\nDuring the twentieth-century the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the following who were primarily dramatists:\n\n\nThe 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the Englishman Harold Pinter, most of whose works originated in the twentieth-century.\n\n\n"}
