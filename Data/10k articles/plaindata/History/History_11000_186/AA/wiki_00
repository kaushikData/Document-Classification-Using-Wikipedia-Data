The Argentines mounted amphibious landings, and the invasion ended with the surrender of Government House.\n\nGovernor Rex Hunt was informed by the British Government of a possible Argentine invasion on 1 April 1982. At 3:30 pm that day he received a telegram from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office stating:\n\nThe Governor summoned the two senior Royal Marine officers of Naval Party 8901 to Government House in Stanley to discuss the options for defending the Falklands. He said during the meeting: \"Sounds like the buggers mean it\".\n\nMajor Mike Norman was given overall command of the Marines due to his seniority, while Major Gary Noott became the military advisor to Governor Hunt. The total strength was 68 Marines and 11 sailors, which was greater than would normally have been available because the garrison was in the process of changing over – both the replacements and the troops preparing to leave were in the Falklands at the time of the invasion.\n\nThis was decreased to 57 when 22 Royal Marines embarked aboard the Antarctic patrol ship HMS \"Endurance\" to observe Argentine soldiers based at South Georgia. The Royal Navy, and author Russell Phillips state that a total of 85 marines were present at Stanley.\n\nTheir numbers were reinforced by at least 25 Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF) members. Graham Bound, an islander who lived through the Argentine occupation, reports in his book \"Falkland Islanders At War\" that the higher figure of 40 (including 15 ex-FIDF members) members of the FIDF reported for duty at their drill hall. Their commanding officer, Major Phil Summers, tasked the volunteer militiamen (including his son Brian Summers) with guarding such key points as the telephone exchange, the radio station and the power station. Skipper Jack Sollis, on board the civilian coastal ship \"Forrest\", operated his boat as an improvised radar screen station off Stanley. Two other civilians, former Royal Marines Jim Fairfield and a Canadian citizen, Bill Curtiss, also offered their services to the governor.\n\nPrior to the main Argentine landings, the British sailors under orders from the Chief Secretary, Dick Baker, rounded up 30 Argentine nationals living in Port Stanley, placing them in protective custody.\n\nThe Argentine amphibious operation began in the late evening of Thursday 1 April, when the destroyer ARA \"Santisima Trinidad \" disembarked special naval forces south of Stanley. The bulk of the Argentine force was to land some hours later from the amphibious warfare ship ARA \"Cabo San Antonio\" near the airport, on a beach previously marked by frogmen from the submarine ARA \"Santa Fe\".\n\nThe operation had been called \"Azul\" (Blue) during the planning stage, but it was finally renamed \"Rosario\" (Rosary).\n\nOperation \"Rosario\" began with the reconnaissance of Port William by the submarine ARA \"Santa Fe\" and the landing of 14 members of the tactical divers group near Cape Pembroke, including the commander of this elite unit, Lieutenant-Commander Alfredo Raúl Cufré. The reconnaissance mission began as early as 31 March, when the trawler \"Forrest\" was spotted through the periscope at 10:00 PM off Port Stanley. The next day, \"Santa Fe\" learned that the authorities in Stanley were aware of the Argentine plans, so a change was necessary. Instead of landing right on Pembroke, the commandos would initially take a beach near Menguera Point, south of Kidney Island.\n\nThe commandos left \"Santa Fe\" at 1:40 PM. From the beach, the special troops headed towards Pembroke peninsula in Zodiac boats. They reached Yorke Bay at 4:30 AM of 2 April. After planting beacons for the main landing, they took over the airstrip and the lighthouse without resistance. Argentine sources claim that they captured a few prisoners. After the British surrender at Port Stanley, this team was given the task of gathering the Royal Marines and taking them into custody.\n\nOn the night of 1-2 April 1982, \"Santísima Trinidad\" halted 500 metres off Mullet Creek and lowered 21 Gemini assault craft into the water. They contained 84 special forces troopers of Lieutenant-Commander Guillermo Sánchez-Sabarots's 1st Amphibious Commandos Group and a small party under Lieutenant-Commander Pedro Giachino, who was normally second-in-command of the 1st Marine Infantry Battalion, that was to capture Government House. The Argentine Rear Admiral Jorge Allara, through a message radioed from \"Santisima Trinidad\", had requested to Rex Hunt a peaceful surrender, but the proposal was rejected.\n\nGiachino's party had the shortest distance to go: two and a half miles due north. Moody Brook Barracks, the destination of the main party, was six miles away, over rough terrain. Lieutenant-Commander Sánchez-Sabarots, in the book \"The Argentine Fight for the Falklands\", describes the main party's progress in the dark:\n\nThe main party of Argentine Marines assumed that the Moody Brook Barracks contained sleeping Royal Marines. The barracks were quiet, although a light was on in the office of the Royal Marine commander. No sentries were observed, and it was a quiet night, apart from the occasional animal call. Lieutenant-Commander Sánchez-Sabarots could hear nothing of any action at Government House, nor from the distant landing beaches; nevertheless, he ordered the assault to begin. Lieutenant-Commander Sánchez-Sabarots continues his account:\n\nThe noise of the grenades alerted Major Norman to the presence of Argentines on the island, and he thus drove back to Government House. Realising that the attack was coming from Moody Brook, he ordered all troop sections to converge on the house to enable the defence to be centralised.\n\nAlthough there were no Royal Marine witnesses to the assault, British descriptions of the state of Moody Brook barracks afterwards contradict the Argentine version of events. After the Royal Marines were allowed to return to barracks to collect personal items. Major Norman describes walls of the barracks as riddled with machine gun fire and bearing the marks of white phosphorus grenades—\"a classic houseclearing operation\". The Argentines maintain that the barracks were destroyed in an air attack on 12 June (involving Flight Lieutenant Mark Hare and Wing Commander Peter Squire) that killed three conscripts (Privates Mario Gustavo Rodriguez, Carlos Gustavo Mosto and Ignacio Maria Indino from 10th Brigade Headquarters) and wounded their commander, Major José Rodolfo Banetta.\n\nThere was a more pressing action on the eastern edge of Stanley. Twenty US-built LVTP-7A1 Argentine tracked amphibious armoured personnel carriers from Lieutenant-Commander Guillermo Cazzaniga's 1st Amphibious Vehicles Battalion, carrying D and E Companies of the 2nd Marine Infantry Battalion (BIM-2) from Puerto Belgrano, had been landed from the tank landing ship ARA \"Cabo San Antonio\" at Yorke Bay, and were being watched by a section of Royal Marines under the command of Lieutenant Bill Trollope. Two Argentine-built landing crafts (Numbers 09 and 23), also took part in the landings later that morning and would fall into British hands at the end of the fighting in June.\n\nThe armoured column trundled along the Airport Road into Stanley, with three Amtracs (Numbers 05, 07 and 19) in the vanguard, and, near the Ionospheric Research Station, at exactly 7:15 am, was engaged by a section of Royal Marines with anti-tank rockets and machine guns. This is from Lieutenant-Commander Hugo Santillán's official post-battle report:\n\nThe Amtrac on the right manoeuvred itself off the road into a little depression and as it did so, disembarked the Marines inside (including one wounded, Private Horacio Tello) out of view. This encouraged the Royal Marines to think that Gibbs had scored a direct hit on the passenger compartment of the APC.\n\nLieutenant Bill Trollope, with No. 2 Section, describes the action:\n\nAccording to Governor Hunt in his \"memoirs\", Marines Brown and Betts brought the leading Amtrac to a screeching halt with a direct hit in one of the forward tracks while Marine Gibbs scored another hit in the passenger compartment:\n\nLieutenant Trollope and his men withdrew along Davis Street, running behind the houses with Argentine Marines in hot pursuit, and went to ground firing up the road when it became obvious they could not reach Government House.\n\nCorporal Lou Armour, commanding '1 Section', was positioned at Hookers Point when the invasion began. Shortly after the attack on Moody Brook, he was ordered to withdraw to Government House, meeting up with Corporal David Carr's section along the way.\n\nAs both sections headed off to find Lieutenant Trollope's men, Corporal Armour decided to have one more try at getting into Government House. Using fire and maneuver to cross a football pitch they then crawled along the hedgerow leading to the gardens where they experienced Friendly fire. According to Corporal Armour:\n\nThey eventually made it to safety via the kitchen door. Corporal Armour again:\n\nIn the meantime, Corporal Stefan York and No 6 Section had been patiently manning their hide on the western end of Navy Point. As the Argentine landing crafts approached Stanley Harbour, Marine Rick Overall fired a Carl Gustav anti-tank round that the British claimed penetrated the side of an Argentine Marine LCVP, killing all on board.\n\nLying on a small hillock south of Government House, Lieutenant-Commander Pedro Giachino faced the difficulty of capturing this important objective with no radio and with a force of only 16 men. He split his force into small groups, placing one on either side of the house and one at the rear. Unknown to them, the governor's residence was the main concentration point of the Royal Marines, who outnumbered the commandos by over two to one.\n\nThe first attack against this building came at 6.30 a.m., barely an hour before the Yorke Bay amphibious landing, when one of Giachino's squads, led by Lieutenant Gustavo Adolfo Lugo, started to exchange fire with the British troops inside the house. At the same time, Giachino himself, with four of his subordinates, entered the servants' annexe, believing it to be the rear entrance to the residence. Four Royal Marines, Corporals Mick Sellen and Fleet and Marines Harry Dorey and Murray Paterson, who were placed to cover the annexe, beat off the first attack. Giachino was hit instantly as he burst through the door, while Lieutenant Diego Garcia Quiroga was shot in the arm. The remaining three retreated to the maid's quarters.\n\nGiachino was not dead, but very badly wounded. An Argentine combat medic, Corporal Ernesto Urbina, attempted to get to Giachino but was wounded by a grenade. Giachino, seeing what had happened, pulled the pin from a hand grenade and threatened to use it. The Royal Marines then attempted to persuade the officer to get rid of the grenade so that they could give him medical treatment, but he refused, preventing them from reaching his position. After the surrender of the British forces at Government House, some three hours later, Major Giachino was taken to Stanley Hospital but died from loss of blood.\nAt the governor's office, Major Norman received a radio report from Corporal York's section, which was positioned at Camber peninsula, observing any possible Argentine ship entering Stanley Harbour. The corporal proceeded to report on three potential targets in sight and which should he engage first. \"What are the targets?\" the major enquired. \"Target number one is an aircraft carrier, target number two is a cruiser\", at which point the line went dead.\n\nCorporal York decided to withdraw his section and proceeded to booby trap their Carl Gustav recoilless rifle, before paddling their Gemini assault boat north across Port William. As he did so, York claimed an Argentine destroyer began pursuing them (the corvette ARA \"Granville\" according to Argentine sources). His initiative led to the Gemini reaching an anchored Polish fishing vessel, hiding the small assault boat under her shadow. They patiently waited for a chance, before moving to the shore and landing on a small beach.\n\nBack at Government House, the Argentine commandos' pressure continued unabated. There is some evidence that their use of stun grenades, mistaken as high-explosive rifle-grenades and/or mortars, and their continuous shift of firing positions during the battle led the Royal Marines inside to believe they were facing a large company of marines and were hopelessly outnumbered. Actually, after the failure of Giachino's small platoon to break into the residence, the British were surrounded by only a dozen amphibious commandos. These men were under Lieutenant Lugo, Giachino's second-in-command. The Land Rovers used by the Royal Marines were disabled by automatic gunfire from the commandos. Governor Hunt called Patrick Watts (at the radio station, Radio Stanley), by telephone and said he believed the assaulting force to be the equivalent of a reinforced company:\n\nWe're staying put here, but we are pinned down. We can't move.(...) They must have 200 around us now. They've been throwing rifle grenades at us; I think there may be mortars, I don't know. They came along very quickly and very close, and then they retreated. Maybe they are waiting until the APCs [Amtracs] come along and they think they'll lose less casualties that way.\n\nCorporals Geordie Gill and Terry Pares, both snipers, also claimed to have shot several Argentines through the chest and head as they attempted to scatter along the hillside overlooking Government House:\n\nWe dropped a number of Argentinians as they approached and I had a couple in my sights and made sure they were taken out of the game. It was initially estimated that we had killed five and injured seventeen, but we only counted the bodies that we saw drop in front of us.\n\nMajor Norman's estimate is that Corporals Pares and Gills killed or wounded some four or five Argentine special forces:\n\nCorporals Pares and Gill, were doing an excellent job. Gill would look through his sniper scope and tell Pares where the enemy were and Pares would fire ten rounds rapid, and as soon as that got them on the move, Gill would take them out with the sniper rifle. They took out four or five this way and all the time they were giving the rest of us a running commentary.\n\nIn the official history of both sides, Argentine casualties are listed as one killed and three badly wounded outside Government House. Another three Argentine Marines (Private Horacio Tello, Padre Ángel Maffezini and Lieutenant-Commander Hugo Santillan) were slightly wounded or injured taking cover in the skirmishes in and around Port Stanley.\n\nAround 7.30 a.m., the local police commander Ronnie Lamb, had to order two RFIP (Royal Falkland Islands Police) officers to nearby Government House, in order to rescue a civilian, Henry Halliday, as he blissfully headed off to work, despite the fierce gun-battle taking place all around him.\n\nEventually, Hunt decided to enter talks with Argentine commanders around 8:30 am after Major Norman warned him \"that our defence would be determined, unrelenting-but would be relatively short-lived\".The liaison was Vice-Commodore Hector Gilobert, the head in the islands of LADE, the Argentine government's airline company. Gilobert and a governor's deputy went to the Argentine headquarters displaying a white flag. A de facto ceasefire was put in place at that time which was occasionally breached by small arms fire.\n\nThe governor's envoys found the Argentine command post at Stanley's town hall. The Argentine commander accepted the British offer of a face to face meeting with Hunt at his battered office.\n\nWhile the negotiations were still going on, another incident occurred inside the residence. Three Argentine amphibious commandos who survived the first skirmish along the compound inadvertently alerted Major Noott to their presence, while they had been preparing to leave their hiding place. The Major fired his Sterling submachine gun into the ceiling of the maid's room. According to British reports, the stunned commandos tumbled down the stairs, laying their weapons on the ground. They became the first Argentine prisoners of war of the Falklands War, although by then Governor Hunt had already been in contact with Argentine officials negotiating the terms of surrender.\n\nThe version of Lieutenant Commander Cufré, who was then at Stanley airport, is that the three Amphibious Commandos supporting Giachino's party kept their positions right to the end of the hostilities.\n\nAdmiral Carlos Büsser, commander in chief of the operation, states that a ceasefire was already in place when the three commandos, after realising that the battle was coming to a close and that any loss of life at the time would be futile, laid down their arms to the marines in order to assist the wounded. Just a few minutes after this event, Government House capitulated.\n\nMeanwhile, the Royal Marines in the house saw the approaching Amtracs that had been engaged earlier by Lieutenant Trollope and his section. The Amtracs were Rex Hunt's biggest problem, because they could take up positions outside the range of the Royal Marines and blast Government House to pieces. The vehicles pushed on toward Moody Brook to link up with Sánchez-Sabarots. His amphibious commandos were plodding slowly along the road to reinforce their colleagues besieging Government House after taking some prisoners near the racecourse. Major Norman had earlier advised Governor Hunt that the Royal Marines and the governor could break out to the countryside and set up a 'seat of government' elsewhere, but when he finally met the commander of the Argentine seaborne forces, Admiral Büsser, he agreed to surrender his troops to the now overwhelming Argentine forces at 9:30 am. It was a hard decision for Governor Hunt to make:\n\nWhile Major Noott accompanied Busser outside Government House, the British officer applied morphine and the tourniquet on the Argentine wounded that would staunch the heavy bleeding and, Lieutenant Diego García Quiroga would later say Noott saved his life.\n\nHunt would later state in mid-April that the defenders fired 6,000 rounds in the fighting at Government House and elsewhere. The Falklands Governor disputed Argentine claims that the seaborne assault resulted in only one Argentine dead and two wounded; telling \"Time Magazine\" reporters Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce in their 12 April 1982 article that at least five and possibly 15 invaders were killed and 17 were wounded in the invasion. According to Port Stanley resident John Pole Evans the napalm bombings on 21 April were part of the mock battles in Stanley Common that coincided with General Cristino Nicolaides' visit as commander of the Argentine Army's 1st Corps:\nWe knew what sort of damage they could do, because during April whilst we were still in our homes, they'd bombed the Tussock Island in the harbour with napalm and it burned for a couple of days. This was like a warning of what they were capable of—that they could destroy the settlement if they wanted to. For them it was probably just some sort of target practice.\n\nFearing that British had established an Observation Post on Tussock Island, Major Mario Castagneto's 601st Commando Company was sent to clear the island of enemy special forces, but returned empty handed and completely covered in black soot due to another Pucara napalm bombing on 1 May.\n\nAfter the surrender, the Royal Marines and two rifle sections under Corporals Gerald Cheek and Pat Peck from the FIDF were then herded onto the playing fields.Pictures and film were taken of the British prisoners arranged face-down on the ground. This was probably an attempt to demonstrate the lack of British casualties, but it backfired: The images galvanised the British public when they were broadcast on television and increased public opposition to the invasion. Corporal Armour's section had fought on the second floor at Government House and was taken prisoner: \nThere were three casualties lying in the garden of Government House. You think: What sort of mood are they going to be in when their oppos are shot up? When we were actually lying down I felt a bit humiliated but I also felt apprehensive about what was going to happen next. One of the Argentine officers came along and actually struck one of the guards and told us to stand up. We stood up and he shook my hand and a few other guys' hands and said that we shouldn't lie down, that we should be proud of what we'd done.\"\"\n\nThe Royal Marines had fought with bravery and skill for they had killed one of his best officers, Carlos Busser said. Now they could lay down their arms with their military honor intact. The appeal succeeded in that the governor decided he had no choice but to accept the inevitable. The Royal Marines were allowed, 10 at a time, to return to Moody Brook Barracks under armed guard and were given ten minutes to pack their personal belongings.\n\nSoon afterward, the Royal Marines were moved to a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, which would take them to Comodoro Rivadavia, where they were to be picked up by another airliner to Uruguay and on to the United Kingdom. Members of the FIDF were not taken to Argentina along with members of NP 8901; instead they were disarmed and returned to their homes. As the Marines were being taken to Montevideo, one of them said to an Argentine guard \"don't make yourself too comfy here mate, we'll be back\".\n\nCorporal York's section remained at large. On 4 April, they reached Long Island Farm owned by a Mrs Watson. York had no radio, and due to worries about possible civilian deaths, chose to surrender to Argentine forces. They gave their position to the Argentine Army using a local islander's radio, and York subsequently ordered his men to destroy and then bury their weapons. Major Patricio Dowling and a platoon from the 181 Military Police Company platoon were helicoptered forward and after roughly handling Yorke's men and posing for pictures, locked up the Royal Marines men in Stanley Police Station. Yorke's section would then be held in Comodoro Rivadavia along with Lieutenant Keith Mill's 22-man platoon and supporting 13-man British Antarctic Survey (BAS) detachment under Steve Martin captured in South Georgia.\n\nIn Buenos Aires, huge flag-waving crowds flooded the Plaza de Mayo upon hearing the news. Argentina's losses in the operation were one dead and three wounded. In London, where the bad news was fully known from Argentine sources, the government was in a state of shock. The crisis prompted the resignation of the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington.\n\nThe next day, Argentine forces captured the island chain of South Georgia, 1350 km to the east of the Falklands. In that action, the Argentines suffered one sailor from the corvette ARA \"Guerrico\" and two marines killed (Navy Corporal Patricio Guanca and marine conscripts Mario Almonacid and Jorge Aguila). One British Royal Marine was wounded in an exchange of fire with the Argentine troops. The Marines eventually surrendered when this position was bracketed by the \"Guerrico's\" main 100mm gun.\n\nDuring his stay in Comodoro Rivadavia, Corporal Lou Armour befriended two English-speaking Argentine conscripts, Edgardo Blaguerman and Mariano Tantignone at the Liceo Militar \"General Roca\" that had been converted into a Prisoner of War Camp. In 2017, Armour agreed to return to Argentina to take part in the Argentine play \"Minefield\" that brought the former enemies together in a reconciliation move.\n\nTerry Peck, former Port Stanley Chief-of-Police and former member of the FIDF, set up a resistance base near Estancia House in April. He was soon joined by ex-Sergeant Neil Watson, Patrick Minto, Patrick Witney and other ex-FIDF soldiers who armed themselves with the rifles and 66mm anti-tank rockets that Corporal Stefan York and his Marines had buried at Long Island Farm. Peck, Minto, Witney and others would later join Captain Matthew Selfridge's D (Patrols) Company from 3 PARA at Douglas Settlement and help SAS/SBS teams secure Mounts Kent and Estancia. In June, Terry Peck and Vernon Steen would act as guides in the 3 PARA patrols at Murrell Bridge sent out to reconnoitre the Argentine Mount Longdon stronghold.\n\nOn 3 April 1982, the United Nations Security Council comprising the five permanent members and with Poland, Spain, Ireland, Panama, Guyana, Japan, Jordan, Uganda, Zaire, and Togo) passed the Resolution 502 demanding an immediate withdrawal of all Argentine forces from the islands and called on the governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to seek a diplomatic solution to the situation and refrain from further military action. Panama voted against this resolution, with China, Poland, Spain and the Soviet Union abstaining. All 10 remaining members voted for the resolution.\n\nAt 16:30 local time on 2 April 1982, the last telex conversation between the operator in the Falklands and an operative in London, announced that the islands were under Argentine control.\nLON (London): HELLO THERE WHAT ARE ALL THESE RUMOURS WE HEAR THIS IS LON<br>\nFK (Falklands): WE HAVE LOTS OF NEW FRIENDS <br>\nLON: WHAT ABOUT INVASION RUMOURS<br>\nFK: THOSE ARE THE FRIENDS I WAS MEANING<br>\nLON: THEY HAVE LANDED<br>\nFK: ABSOLUTELY<br>\nLON: ARE YOU OPEN FOR TRAFFIC (i.e. normal telex service)<br>\nFK: NO ORDERS ON THAT YET ONE MUST OBEY ORDERS<br>\nLON: WHOSE ORDERS<br>\nFK: THE NEW GOVERNORS<br>\nLON: ARGENTINA<br>\nFK: YES<br>\nLON: ARE THE ARGENTINIANS IN CONTROL<br>\nFK: YES YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THOUSANDS OF TROOPS PLUS ENORMOUS NAVY SUPPORT WHEN YOU ARE ONLY 1800 STRONG. STAND BY PLEASE.\n\nThe timeline of the operation was as follows:\n\n\n\n"}

His book on the Sierra Leone Creole people, \"Creoledom: A study of the development of Freetown society\", examines their society in a way in which few books of their time period had, and it is one of the most quoted books on the Creoles. He has also been published in East Africa and the UK.\n\nArthur Porter was born in 1924 in Freetown, British Sierra Leone, to Guy Hardesty Porter and Adelina Porter. Guy Porter was an electrical engineer who died as a civil servant. Adelina Porter was a school teacher at the Freetown Secondary School for Girls, which was attended by Porter's sister, Iyatunde Harriet Maria Palmer (\"née\" Porter). Porter attended the Cathedral School in Freetown.\n\nLike many Creoles, Porter is of West Indian, Jamaican Maroon, Liberated African, and Nova Scotian settler descent. His paternal grandfather was Arthur Thomas Porter I (1834–1908), a successful Creole businessman of West Indian and Jamaican Maroon parentage. The father of A. T. Porter I was Guy Porter, a West Indian immigrant to Sierra Leone via England, who became a headman of Kent Village. Guy Porter married a Maroon colonist. The Porter family house owned by A. T. Porter I was at No. 11 Wilberforce Street in the heart of Settler Town and near Zion Methodist Church.\n\nPorter is also of \"Settler\" or Nova Scotian stock, by way of a Virginian ancestor who had arrived in Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia. The Virginian had occupied a house in what the Nova Scotians called Settler Town, Sierra Leone, and was one of the founders of Freetown. He is a graduate of the Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine in Cambridge, England.\n\nPorter married a woman from Denmark and had two children, Arthur and Emma. He is the grandfather of four girls: Gemma, Fiona, Adina and Charlotte. He lives in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and he makes frequent trips back to his homeland, Sierra Leone. Porter's son, Arthur Porter IV, was a Canadian physician and former Director General (CEO) of the McGill University Health Centre.\n\nPorter's work on Sierra Leonean history is considered to be among the most scholarly work done on the people of his native Sierra Leone. Porter's analysis of the stratification of Creole society is considered the most authoritative work on the development of Creole society, and most scholars reference his book when researching the Creole people. The work he accomplished during his tenure at Fourah Bay College has made many look upon Porter as one in the mould of historian Christopher Fyfe, Professor Eldred D. Jones, Professor Akintola J. G. Wyse, and linguist Leo Spitzer.\n\nAfter leaving his post as Vice-Principal of Fourah Bay College, Porter moved to East Africa and became Principal of the University College, Nairobi, one of the three colleges of the University of East Africa. His term there ended in 1970.\n\n"}

The Baban principality played an active role in Ottoman-Persian conflict. The founder of the princely Baban family is thought to be Ahmad Faqih or Faqi Ahmad from the district of Pijder. The Babans claimed descent from a Frankish woman, Keghan, who was taken prisoner in a battle by the Ottomans. According to the \"Sharafnama\" the clan's first chief was Pir Badak Babe, who is believed to have lived around 1500.\nBaban princes retained some autonomy in return for providing security for the Ottoman Empire along the Iranian border. Sulaiman Beg was the first Baban prince to gain control of the province of Shahrizor and its capital, Kirkuk. He invaded Iran, defeating forces from the principality of Ardalan in 1694. Ottoman Sultan Mustafa II assigned him the district of Baban, which included the town of Kirkuk.\n\nThe city of Sulaimaniyah was founded by Baban prince Mahmud Pasha in 1781. Baban rulers encouraged cultural and literary activities in their domain. During the first half of the 19th century a school of poetry was established under Baban patronage, of which classical Kurdish poet Nali was the central figure.\n\nBaban princes aided Ottoman forces in Iranian wars from 1723–1746. From 1750 to 1847, Baban history was dominated by rivalries with other Kurdish principalities (such as Soran and Bohtan) and its opposition to centralization by the Ottomans and the Qajars. The principality was destroyed during the mid-19th century Ottoman modernization period. The Baban revolt lasted for three years, but was defeated by a coalition of Ottoman forces and Kurdish tribes. Ahmed Pasha Baban, the last Baban ruler, was defeated near Koya in 1847 and the region of Shahrazur was annexed to the Ottoman Empire. The last Baban prince left Sulaimaniya in 1850, after fighting the Turks for the independence of southern Kurdistan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Praxis is described as a combination of reflection and action that realizes the historicity of human persons. In this sense actions are realized in light of the way they affect history. History has to be seen as a whole, combining in an incarnational way, our salvation history and our \"human\" history.\n\nMost liberation theologians see Christian theological praxis mainly as lived and expressed in the life of community. \"Any discourse of faith starts from, and takes its bearings from, the Christian life of Community\". This is where a community is said to become an expression of the presence of the Kingdom of God, so long as it is being true to its calling to Christian praxis. This has been the vision shared by the basic ecclesial communities, which follow a pattern of Christian praxis based on what Gustavo Gutierrez said: \"To be followers of Jesus requires that [we] walk with and be committed to the poor; when [we] do, [we] experience an encounter with the Lord who is simultaneously revealed and hidden in the faces of the poor\".\n\n"}

Its name means the \"castle carved out by demons\". It is located on a 30 or 40 km-long peninsula of the Ustyurt Plateau that is part of the Karakum Desert, surrounded by a vast and bleak wilderness. It cannot be reached from the main road and the area itself requires an escort from soldiers at a local checkpoint. Dev-Kesken, specifically, is the remains of a citadel (a fortified town) within the larger site of the ruined city of Vazir. Little is known about Vazir's early history, but the ruins collectively date back to the 4th to 3rd centuries BCE.\n\nDev-Kesken is part of the larger archaeological complex of Vazir which is best described as having an upper town and a lower town. To the South-West corner of upper town are the ruins of a large, rectangular citadel. Roughly 100 meters in size, Dev-Kesken is an unfired mud brick castle that looks almost as if it is part of its surrounding landscape. The walls of the citadel have regularly spaced rectangular towers with two square towers at the corners. Topping these walls are also fluted pilasters, or fluted rectangular columns that are ejecting from the wall. Between the walls were, at one time, two galleries - a lower and an upper with loopholes for archers along the wall and in the towers. Sometime later the loopholes along the upper gallery were filled and new outer walls were added. New semicircular towers were also added to the citadel at a later point in time. Dev-Kesken fell into decay roughly at the beginning of 4th century A.D.\n\nFirst settled between 4th or 3rd century BCE, little is known about the history of Dev-Kesken. It was eventually abandoned, supposedly after it entered a time of environmental and social change. The already arid desert climate worsened as the levels of nearby rivers lowered and even the Aral Sea had contracted into a series of pools. Later in time, people of the nearby city Gurganji supposedly dammed what may have been a crucial river to the city of Visar. This may have also affected the climate of the region. Evidence from the local archaeological record suggests that other nearby rivers flowing into the Sarykamysh Lake may have begun to dry out at sometime around the 4th century while urban centers of nearby cities declined. Further excavation and study is needed to better understand why Dev-Kesken declined into ruin.\n"}

{"id": "1184321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1184321", "title": "Ethnic clashes of Târgu Mureș", "text": "Ethnic clashes of Târgu Mureș\n\nThe ethnic clashes of Târgu Mureș (also called \"Black March\") refer to violent incidents between the Romanian and Hungarian ethnic groups in Transylvania, Romania in the early 1990s. The clashes were the bloodiest inter-ethnic incidents of the post-communist era in Transylvania. Târgu Mureș (Hungarian: \"Marosvásárhely\") is a Romanian town, with an ethnically mixed population that was almost equally distributed between Romanians and Hungarians after the fall of the communist regime in December 1989. It has been an important cultural and political center for the Hungarian minority in Transylvania.\n\nIn March 1990, brief but violent clashes occurred there between the two ethnic groups in the town, involving ethnic Romanians from neighboring villages. The clashes left 6 people dead and 300 injured. The riots were broadcast nationally on Romanian television and were covered by media around the world.\n\nThe exact cause is still widely disputed. The roles of the media and the Romanian government are also questioned.\n\nAt the beginning of March 1990, two episodes involving Romanian statues occurred. Graffiti was found on the statue of the Romanian historical figure Avram Iancu, and a statue of another Romanian personality in a neighboring town was stolen. A Romanian newspaper referred to events of the same kind that took place before the 1940 Romanian-Hungarian conflict.\n\nDuring the celebrations of the Hungarian community on the national day of the Hungarians (15th of March), accusations of nationalism and separatism began to be heard from Romanians.\nThe next day, groups of heavily-intoxicated Romanians began to attack state-owned stores in which ethnic Hungarians had changed the signage to include Hungarian. Students sang anti-Hungarian songs and pillaged a Hungarian Protestant church.\n\nOn 20 March, Romanian villagers, dispatched by coach and train, arrived to the city and violently attacked the headquarters of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania. The local Hungarians tried to defend it, and the area fell into violence. The involvement of the Romanian government in connection with the stimulation of ethnic violence is not completely unfounded (Andreescu 2001, Gallagher, 2005).\n\nThe media enlarged the tensions and contributed, by inflammatory discourse, to the worsening of the situation. The parliamentary report on the events confirmed that the media reported falsely about the heavy influx of Hungarians to help their co-nationals in their fight for a separate Transylvania. Incitements about \"separatist\" trends were used in an effort to manufacture ethnic conflict.\n\nThe events are viewed differently by the sides that were involved. The 16 March incident at \"Pharmacy no. 28\" is an example of the capacity of the media to present the same event with opposite connotations. A news brief was presented, by both the Romanian and the Hungarian press, both using it to draw attention to the danger represented by the actions of \"the others\". Romanian media announced that the pharmacist wiped inscriptions in Romanian, and the Hungarian press wrote that the Romanians wiped the Hungarian inscription.\n\nAccording to the correspondent of the Romanian television, in the neighbouring town of Sovata, a statue of Nicolae Bălcescu was knocked down, generating vehement protests of Vatra Românească.\n\nSeveral teams of cameramen from the Romanian army filmed numerous episodes of an explicitly anti-Romanian turn. There were shown groups of Hungarians who chanted \"Horthy, Horthy!\", \"Death to Romanians!\" and \"Transylvania to Hungary!\" A 2010 article from Jurnalul Național talks about the influx of 10,000 Hungarian \"tourists\" who were officially coming to commemorate the Revolution of 1848. There are accounts in the same period of the desecration of the statues of Avram Iancu, Nicolae Bălcescu and some arson attempts on Romanian houses in Sovata. Such acts have generated counter-manifestations by the Romanian population.\n\nAlso, the \"road signs war\" started and would continue for years throughout Transylvania. One of the \"Târgu Mureș\" signs at the entry into the city was replaced with a \"Marosvasarhely\" Hungarian sign. The change sparked anger from Azomureş Romanian employees, who restored the Romanian sign.\n\nIn March, violence broke out between ethnic Hungarians and Romanians in the Transylvanian city of Târgu Mureș. On March 19, the headquarters of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) was attacked by a large group of ethnic Romanians. The police and army did not respond to the UDMR's calls for protection until several hours after the attack began. Many ethnic Hungarians trapped inside were seriously injured.\n\nOn the following morning, some 15,000 ethnic Hungarians gathered in the town square to protest the previous day's events. A group of approximately 3,000 ethnic Romanians hostile to the Hungarians' demands for autonomy began to gather on one side of the square in the early afternoon. Tensions escalated as word spread that buses of ethnic Romanian peasants from neighboring villages were heading toward town to support the Romanians in the square. By 2:30 p.m., the Chief of Police gave assurances to ethnic Romanian and Hungarian leaders in the square that the police had blocked off entrances to the city. However, unconfirmed reports indicated that the police allowed buses of ethnic Romanians through the roadblocks. Romanian peasants from villages outside Târgu Mureş arrived in the town center long after the roads should have been closed, and joined the Romanians already in the square.\n\nAround 5:00 p.m., violence erupted between ethnic Romanians and ethnic Hungarians, breaking the single line of 50 police that the authorities had sent to divide the two groups. Although the police and army had been made aware of the potential for violence by both Hungarian and Romanian leaders, who had made numerous reports of the escalating tensions in the square, the authorities once again failed to respond in an adequate manner to protect the citizens of Târgu Mureș.\n\nAccording to the US State Department Human Rights Report for 1993:\n\nThe UDMR condemned the Supreme Court's June 7 rejection of an appeal in the case of Pal Cseresznyés, an ethnic Hungarian serving a 10-year sentence for attempted murder as a result of his involvement in the Târgu Mureș incidents of March 1990. Cseresznyés participated in the savage beating of an ethnic Romanian, which an international journalist captured on film. The UDMR's complaint centered on the length of his sentence and on the fact that he was the only one of those filmed who was brought to trial. The court maintained that, regardless of the fates of the others involved, Cseresznyes had received a fair trial and was guilty as charged. Thus it found no legal reason to grant an appeal.\n\nThere were 5 dead (three ethnic Hungarians and two ethnic Romanians) and 278 injured.\nDuring the penal investigation and the court trials that followed, two ethnic Hungarians (Pál Cseresznyés and Ernő Barabás) and seven others were convicted.\n\nThere were victims on both sides, two of which received particular attention:\n\nThe prevalent opinion in the Romanian public is that the incidents were triggered by direct attacks by Hungarians against Romanian institutions, symbols, statues and policemen. They claim that the riots were part of a plan to separate part of Transylvania from Romania to reintegrate it with Hungary.\n\nMost Hungarians maintain, however, that rumours about Hungarian violence against Romanians and/or state institutions were unjustified or widely exaggerated. Hungarians also state that rumours about Hungarian violence were spread to undermine legitimate Hungarian demands (such as language, cultural rights or possible ethnic-based regional autonomy).\n\nThe nature of the involvement of the Romanian government is also disputed. The official account is that the government quickly succeeded in calming the situation and ended the clashes. However, that has been disputed:\nAccording to a 1990 report by Human Rights Watch, \"the authorities... failed to respond in an adequate manner to protect the citizens of Târgu Mureș\". In this sense, the riots can be seen as a symptom of the fact that police, and the law enforcement agencies in general were very weak and morally compromised at the time because of how the communist regime had fallen. That opinion is reinforced by the similar pattern in some subsequent events (Piaţa Universităţii and the miners' invasion of Bucharest).\n\nThe quality of the Western media's coverage of the riots is contested by many Romanians. An often-cited example is the gruesome footage of Mihăilă Cofariu, who was presented as a Hungarian being beaten by Romanians in the documentary \"And the walls came tumbling down: Bad Neighbours\", directed by Peter Swain and produced by ethnic Hungarian Paul Neuberg. According to its director, the filming crew arrived in Transylvania after the events, and most footage, including that of Mihăilă Cofariu, were provided by the Hungarian producer team, who let them believe that Cofariu was really a Hungarian being beaten by Romanians.\n\nAlso, during filming, the crew had no contact at all with any ethnic Romanian, and all documentation was gathered only from Hungarian sources, including some Hungarian contacts from the political scene.\n\nWestern media, picking up the story from the documentary, presented the Mihăilă Cofariu footage in the same way: as a Hungarian being beaten by Romanians. That falsehood is often used in Romanian media to link various similar cases of anti-Romanian falsehoods in Hungarian and Western media.\n\n\n\n"}

He joined the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1940s and worked on its weekly journal. Osman was awarded an undergraduate degree in 1948 from Cairo University where he majored in history in 1948. He broke with Sayyid Qutb and the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1950s and wrote the 1960 book \"Islamic Thought and Change\", which presented a more progressive view of the religion, earned a law degree in 1960 from Alexandria University in 1960 and returned to Cairo University where he received a master's degree in Islamic-Byzantine relations in 1962. He was on the faculty of Al-Azhar University during the 1960s, where he worked on restructuring the teaching of Islam at universities and colleges in Egypt. He was granted a doctorate in Near Eastern studies in 1976 from Princeton University, where he wrote a dissertation on the subject of Islamic land ownership and taxation and later taught history at Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University in Saudi Arabia.\n\nOsman's writings, including 40 books written in English and Arabic, were aimed at making Islamic civilization and culture more understandable to non-Muslims and at showing followers of Islam that the religion provided the flexibility to adapt to modern times. \"The New York Times\" cited Osman's \"monumental\" 1997 book \"Concepts of the Quran: A Topical Reading\" as \"his most important work in English\", in which he explicated concepts in Islam for non-Muslims.

{"id": "55234564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55234564", "title": "Female education in STEM", "text": "Female education in STEM\n\nFemale education in STEM includes child and adult female represented in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM ). In 2017, 33% of students in STEM fields were women.\n\nThe organization UNESCO has stated that this gender disparity is due to discrimination, biases, social norms and expectations that influence the quality of education women receive and the subjects they study. UNESCO also believes that having more women in STEM fields is desirable because it would help bring about sustainable development. \n\nGender differences in STEM education participation are already visible in early childhood care and education in science- and math-related play, and become more pronounced at higher levels of education. Girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age, particularly between early and late adolescence. This decreased interest affects participation in advanced studies at the secondary level and in higher education. Female students represent 35% of all students enrolled in STEM-related fields of study at this level globally . Differences are also observed by disciplines, with female enrollment lowest in engineering, manufacturing and construction, natural science, mathematics and statistics and ICT fields. Significant regional and country differences in female representation in STEM studies can be observed, though, suggesting the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Women leave STEM disciplines in disproportionate numbers during their higher education studies, in their transition to the world of work and even in their career cycle.\n\nData on gender differences in learning achievement present a complex picture, depending on what is measured (subject, knowledge acquisition against knowledge application), the level of education/age of students, and geographic location. Overall, women's participation has been increasing, but significant regional variations exist. For example, where data are available in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the gender gap is largely in favour of boys in mathematics achievement in secondary education. In contrast, in the Arab States, girls perform better than boys in both subjects in primary and secondary education. As with the data on participation, national and regional variations in data on learning achievement suggest the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Girls’ achievement seems to be stronger in science than mathematics and where girls do better than boys, the score differential is up to three times higher than where boys do better. girls tend to outperform boys in certain sub-topics such as biology and chemistry but do less well in physics and earth science.\n\nThe gender gap has fallen significantly in science in secondary education among TIMSS trend countries: 14 out of 17 participating countries had no gender gap in science in 2015, compared to only one in 1995. However, the data is less well known outside of these 17 countries. The gender gap in boys' favour is slightly bigger in mathematics but improvements over time in girls’ favour are also observed in certain countries, despite the important regional variations. Gender differences are observed within mathematic sub-topics with girls outperforming boys in topics such as algebra and geometry but doing less well in \"number\". Girls’ performance is stronger in assessments that measure knowledge acquisition than those measuring knowledge application. Country coverage in terms of data availability is quite limited while data is collected at different frequency and against different variables in the existing studies. There are large gaps in our knowledge of the situation in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and South and West Asia, particularly at secondary level.\n\nAccording to UNESCO, there are multiple and overlapping factors which influence girls' and women's participation, achievement and progression in STEM studies and careers, all of which interact in complex ways, including: \n\nThe question of whether there are differences in cognitive ability between men and women has long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars. Some studies have found no differences in the neural mechanism of learning based on sex.\n\nLoss of interest has been the major reason cited for girls opting out of STEM. However, some have stated that this choice is influenced heavily by the socialization process and stereotyped ideas about gender roles, including stereotypes about gender and STEM. Gender stereotypes that communicate the idea that STEM studies and careers are male domains can negatively affect girls’ interest, engagement and achievement in STEM and discourage them from pursuing STEM careers. Girls who assimilate such stereotypes have lower levels of self-efficacy and confidence in their ability than boys. Self-efficacy affects both STEM education outcomes and aspirations for STEM careers to a considerable extent. Some studies have shown that girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age.\n\nParents, including their beliefs and expectations, play an important role in shaping girls’ attitudes towards, and interest in, STEM studies. Parents with traditional beliefs about gender roles and who treat girls and boys unequally can reinforce stereotypes about gender and ability in STEM. Parents can also have a strong influence on girls' STEM participation and learning achievement through the family values, environment, experiences and encouragement that they provide. Some research finds that parents’ expectations, particularly the mother’s expectations, have more influence on the higher education and career choices of girls than those of boys. Higher socio-economic status and parental educational qualifications are associated with higher scores in mathematics and science for both girls and boys. Girls’ science performance appears to be more strongly associated with mothers’ higher educational qualifications, and boys’ with their fathers’. Family members with STEM careers can also influence girls’ STEM engagement. The broader socio-cultural context of the family can also play a role. Factors such as ethnicity, the language used at home, immigrant status and family structure may also have an influence on girls’ participation and performance in STEM. Peers can also impact on girls’ motivation and feeling of belonging in STEM education. Influence of female peers is a significant predictor of girls’ interest and confidence in mathematics and science.\n\nQualified teachers with specialization in STEM can positively influence girls’ performance and engagement with STEM education and their interest in pursuing STEM careers. Female STEM teachers often have stronger benefits for girls, possibly by acting as role models and by helping to dispel stereotypes about sex-based STEM ability. Teachers’ beliefs, attitudes, behaviours and interactions with students, as well as Curricula and learning materials, can all play a role as well. Opportunities for real-life experiences with STEM, including hands-on practice, apprenticeships, career counselling and mentoring can expand girls’ understanding of STEM studies and professions and maintain interest. Assessment processes and tools that are gender-biased or include gender stereotypes may negatively affect girls’ performance in STEM. Girls’ learning outcomes in STEM can also be compromised by psychological factors such as mathematics or test anxiety.\n\nA 2018 study found that while girls perform better or equal to boys in two out of three countries, in nearly all countries more girls were qualified to college-level study than had enrolled. Researchers found that female enrolment to STEM subjects was relatively lower in countries with a high degree of gender equality – a gender-equality paradox.\n\nCultural and social norms influence girls’ perceptions about their abilities, role in society and career and life aspirations.The degree of gender equality in wider society influences girls’ participation and performance in STEM. In countries with greater gender equality, girls tend to have more positive attitudes and confidence about mathematics and the gender gap in achievement in the subject is smaller. Targeted measures to promote gender equality, such as gender mainstreaming legislation or policies such as quotas, financial incentives or other, can increase girls’ and women’s participation in STEM education and careers. Gender stereotypes portrayed in the media are internalized by children and adults and affect the way they see themselves and others. Media can perpetuate or challenge gender stereotypes about STEM abilities and careers.\n"}

After 1929, it was known as the Serbian Muslim Cultural Society. The organization was pro-Serb and pro-Karađorđević. The organization viewed that the Muslims were Serbs lacking ethnic consciousness. The view that Muslims were Serbs is probably the oldest of three ethnic theories among the Bosnian Muslims themselves. After the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bosnian Muslims, feeling threatened by Catholic Habsburg rule, established several organizations. These included, apart from Gajret, the Muslim National Organization (1906) and the United Muslim Organization (1911). Gajret's main rival was the pro-Croat Muslim organization Narodna Uzdanica, established in 1924. In interwar Yugoslavia, members experienced persecution at the hands of non-Serbs due to their political inclinations.\n\nDuring World War II, the association was dismantled by the Independent State of Croatia. Some members, non-Communists, joined or collaborated with the Yugoslav Partisans (such as M. Sudžuka, Z. Šarac, H. Brkić, H. Ćemerlić, and M. Zaimović). Ismet Popovac and Fehim Musakadić joined the Chetniks.\n\nIn 1945, a new Muslim organization, Preporod, was founded in order to replace the pro-Serb Gajret and pro-Croat Narodna Uzdanica. The former organizations voted for and were merged into Preporod. In 1996 it was reestablished as a Bosniak cultural association.\n\n\n\n"}

Co-chaired by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union (EU), and the United Nations (UN), the Geneva process brings together representatives of the participants of the conflict—Georgia, Russia, and Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia—as well as the United States.\n\nAfter the cessation of the UN and OSCE missions in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, respectively, following the August 2008 Russo–Georgian war, the GID remain the only platform for all interested sides to discuss security-related issues and humanitarian needs of the conflict-affected population.\n\nThe commitment of non-use of force is one of the principal issues at point discussed at several GID rounds. Georgia had made a unilateral pledge of non-use of force on 23 November 2010 and has since insisted Russia should do the same. The Russian government refuses to follow the suit, alleging it is not a party to the conflict. Instead, it wants Georgia to sign treaties envisaging non-use of force directly with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which Georgia refuses on account of the entities being part of its sovereign state. Russia has also expressed its concerns over the Georgians relations with NATO and military cooperation with the United States.\n\nAnother major source of disagreement is the issue of return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, mostly ethnic Georgians, which the Abkhaz and South Ossetian representatives, with Russian backing, reject to discuss as long as Georgia is able to secure the yearly resolutions on IDPs at the UN General Assembly. Among topics touched upon the talks are those related to language of instruction in schools in predominantly ethnic Georgian areas of Abkhazia (such as the Gali district) as well as freedom of movement and mobility, missing persons, environmental and cultural heritage.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, the Abkhaz Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kan Taniya, said in an interview with the German newspaper junge Welt that the discussions in the Geneva International Discussions are locked in a standstill.\n"}
{"id": "47831094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47831094", "title": "History of swimwear", "text": "History of swimwear\n\nHistory of swimwear traces the changes in the styles of men's and women's swimwear over time and between cultures, and touches on the social, religious and legal attitudes to swimming and swimwear.\n\nIn classical antiquity and in most cultures, swimming was either in the nude or the swimmer would merely strip to their underwear. In the Middle Ages, swimming was strongly discouraged, and into the 18th century swimming was regarded as of doubtful morality, and had to be justified on health grounds. In the Victorian era swimwear was of a style of outer clothing of the time, which were cumbersome and even dangerous in the water, especially in the case of dress-style swimwear for women. Since the early 20th century, swimming came to be regarded as a legitimate leisure activity or pastime and clothing made specifically for swimming became the norm. Since then, swimwear has become increasingly more scanty and form-fitting, despite the objections of conservative elements in the community and moral campaigners, and the use of hi-tech materials has become more common.\n\nIn classical antiquity swimming and bathing were done naked. There are Roman murals which show women playing sports and exercising wearing two-piece suits covering the areas around their breasts and hips in a fashion remarkably similar to the present-day bikini. However, there is no evidence that they were used for swimming. All classical pictures of swimming show nude swimmers.\n\nIn various cultural traditions one swims, if not in the nude, in a version in suitable material of a garment or undergarment commonly worn on land, e.g. a loincloth such as the Japanese man's fundoshi.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, swimming and outdoor bathing were discouraged in the Christian West and there was little need for a bathing or swimming costume.\n\nFemale bathing costumes were derived from those worn at Bath and other spas. It would appear that until the 1670s nude female bathing in the spas was the norm and that after that time women bathed clothed. Celia Fiennes gave a detailed description of the standard ladies' bathing costume in 1687:\n\nThe Ladyes go into the bath with Garments made of a fine yellow canvas, which is stiff and made large with great sleeves like a parson’s gown; the water fills it up so that it is borne off that your shape is not seen, it does not cling close as other linning, which Lookes sadly in the poorer sort that go in their own linning. The Gentlemen have drawers and wastcoates of the same sort of canvas, this is the best linning, for the bath water will Change any other yellow.\n\nThe bathing gown in the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve chemise-type gown made of wool or flannel, so that modesty or decency was not threatened.\n\nIn the United Kingdom until the mid-19th century there was no law against nude swimming, and each town was free to make its own laws. For example, the Bath Corporation official bathing dress code of 1737 prescribed, for men:\n\nIt is Ordered Established and Decreed by this Corporation that no Male person above the age of ten years shall at any time hereafter go into any Bath or Baths within this City by day or by night without a Pair of Drawers and a Waistcoat on their bodies.\n\nIn rivers, lakes, streams and the sea men swam in the nude, where the practice was common. Those who did not swim in the nude, stripped to their underwear.\n\nThe Bath Corporation official bathing dress code of 1737 prescribed, for women:\n\nNo Female person shall at any time hereafter go into a Bath or Baths within this City by day or by night without a decent Shift on their bodies.\n\n\"The Expedition of Humphry Clinker\" was published in 1771 and its description of ladies’ bathing costume is different from that of Celia Fiennes a hundred years earlier:\n\nThe ladies wear jackets and petticoats of brown linen, with chip hats, in which they fix their handkerchiefs to wipe the sweat from their faces; but, truly, whether it is owing to the steam that surrounds them, or the heat of the water, or the nature of the dress, or to all these causes together, they look so flushed, and so frightful, that I always turn my eyes another way.\n\nThe English practice of men swimming in the nude was banned in the United Kingdom in 1860. Drawers, or caleçons as they were called, came into use in the 1860s. Even then there were many who protested against them and wanted to remain in the nude. Francis Kilvert described men's bathing suits coming into use in the 1870s as \"a pair of very short red and white striped drawers\".\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century the top became knee-length while an ankle-length drawer was added as a bottom. By the second half of the 19th century, in France, the sleeves started to vanish, the bottom became shorter to reach only the knees and the top became hip-length and both became more form fitting. In the 1900s women wore wool dresses on the beach that were made of up to of fabric.\n\nPenelope Byrde points out that Smollett's description may not be accurate, for he describes a two-piece costume, not the one piece shift or smock that most people describe and is depicted in contemporary prints. His description does, however, tally with Elizabeth Grant's description of the guide's costume at Ramsgate in 1811. The only difference is in the fabric the costumes are made of. Flannel, however, was a common fabric for sea bathing costumes as many believed the warmer fabric was necessary in cold water.\n\nIn the West, in the 19th century women wore a bathing gown in the water. These were loose ankle-length full-sleeve chemise-type gown made of wool or flannel, so that modesty or decency was not threatened. They were long dresses of fabrics that would not become transparent when wet, with weights sewn into the hems so that they would not rise up in the water. The men's swim suit, a rather form-fitting wool garment with long sleeves and legs similar to long underwear, was developed and would change little for a century.\n\nIn the 19th century, the woman's double suit was common, comprising a gown from shoulder to knees plus a set of trousers with leggings going down to the ankles. In the first half of the 19th century the top became knee-length while an ankle-length drawer was added as a bottom. By the second half of the 19th century, in France, the sleeves started to vanish, the bottom became shorter to reach only the knees and the top became hip-length and both became more form fitting. In the 1900s women wore wool dresses on the beach that were made of up to of fabric.\n\nIn the Victorian era, Western cultures deplored nudity of any degree, and people took great pains to cover themselves, even bare chested male swimmers at ocean beaches. Popular beach resorts were commonly equipped with bathing machines designed to avoid the exposure of people in swimsuits, especially to people of the opposite sex.\n\nIn the United States, beauty pageants of women in bathing costumes became popular from the 1880s. However, such events were not regarded as respectable. Beauty contests became more respectable with the first modern \"Miss America\" contest held in 1921, though less respectable beauty contests continued to be held.\n\nIn 1907, the swimmer Annette Kellerman from Australia visited the United States as an \"underwater ballerina\", a version of synchronised swimming involving diving into glass tanks. She was arrested on a Boston beach for indecent exposure because her swimsuit showed arms, legs and the neck, a costume she adopted from England, and which was similar to men's swimsuits of the time. Kellerman changed the suit to have long arms and legs and a collar, still keeping the close fit that revealed the shapes underneath. Kellerman marketed a line of bathing suits and her style of one-piece suits came to be known as \"the Annette Kellerman\". The one-piece swimming tights became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. \"Harper's Bazaar\" praised the Kellerman swimsuit, writing in June 1920 (vol. 55, no. 6, p. 138) \"Annette Kellerman Bathing Attire is distinguished by an incomparable, daring beauty of fit that always remains refined.\" The following year, in June 1921 (vol. 54, no. 2504, p. 101) it wrote that these bathing suits were \"famous ... for their perfect fit and exquisite, plastic beauty of line.\"\n\nDespite opposition from some groups, the form-fitting style proved popular. It was not long before swimwear started to shrink further. At first arms were exposed and then legs up to mid-thigh. Necklines receded from around the neck down to around the top of the bosom. The development of new fabrics allowed for new varieties of more comfortable and practical swimwear.\n\nFemale swimming was introduced at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Competitors from 17 countries took part, with women from nine countries wearing swimsuits similar to Kellerman's swimsuit, which were similar to swimsuits worn by the male swimmers. In 1913, inspired by the breakthrough, the designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two-piece swimwear, a close-fitting one-piece with shorts on the bottom and short sleeves on top. Silent films such as \"The Water Nymph\" (1912) saw Mabel Normand in revealing attire, and this was followed by the daringly dressed \"Sennett Bathing Beauties\" (1915–1929). The name \"swim suit\" was coined in 1915 by Jantzen Knitting Mills, a sweater manufacturer who launched a swimwear brand named the Red Diving Girl. The first annual bathing-suit day at New York's Madison Square Garden in 1916 was a landmark. The swimsuit apron, a design for early swimwear, disappeared by 1918, leaving a tunic covering the shorts.\n\nPublic nudity was a major concern in designing early swimwear. It was a major factor behind the non-participation of American women in the 1912 Olympics. At those Games, British women wore full-body silk suits of such a volume that they could be passed through a wedding ring. The suits were complemented by bras and bikini-style briefs as they became transparent when wet. Women's coaches were rare at early Olympics, and to further reduce the chances of harassment women were accompanied by chaperones. Even men wore one-piece swimsuits covering the body from hips to shoulders up to the 1940s.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, people began to shift from \"taking in the water\" to \"taking in the sun\", at bathhouses and spas, and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features. Rayon was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits, but its durability, especially when wet, proved problematic, with jersey and silk also sometimes being used.\n\nBurlesque and vaudeville performers wore two-piece outfits in the 1920s. The 1929 film \"Man with a Movie Camera\" shows Russian women wearing early two-piece swimsuits which expose their midriff, and a few who are topless. Films of holidaymakers in Germany in the 1930s show women wearing two-piece suits, In 1928, Speedo introduced their racerback silk suit that was optimized to fit the body shape.\n\nBy the 1930s men began to go without shirts for swimming, and barechestedness in male swimwear became the norm by the end of the 1940s, including in competitive swimming events, in which men are not only barechested, but wear a swimming suit that is intended merely to meet public decency requirements. The norm of male barechestedness in swimwear extended to other competitive sports, such as professional boxing and professional wrestling.\n\nBy the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves disappeared and sides were cut away and tightened. With the development of new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Hollywood endorsed the new glamour with films such as \"Neptune's Daughter\" (1949) in which Esther Williams wore provocatively named costumes such as \"Double Entendre\" and \"Honey Child\". Williams, who also was an Amateur Athletic Union champion in the 100 meter freestyle (1939) also portrayed Kellerman in the 1952 film \"Million Dollar Mermaid\" (titled as \"The One Piece Bathing Suit\" in UK). American designer Adele Simpson, a Coty American Fashion Critics' Awards winner (1947) and a notable alumna of the New York art school Pratt Institute, who believed clothes must be comfortable and practical designed a large part of her wardrobe which included mostly one-piece suits that were considered fashionable even in the early 1980s. This was when Cole of California started marketing revealing prohibition suits and Catalina Swimwear introduced almost bare-back designs.\n\nCoco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in \"Gold Diggers of 1933\". The Busby Berkeley film \"Footlight Parade\" of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's \"The Hurricane\" (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits. The 1934 film, Fashions of 1934 featured chorus girls wearing two-piece outfits which look identical to modern bikinis. In 1934, a National Recreation Association study on the use of leisure time found that swimming, encouraged by the freedom of movement the new swimwear designs provided, was second only to movies in popularity as free time activity out of a list of 94 activities. In 1935 American designer Claire McCardell cut out the side panels of a maillot-style bathing suit, the bikini's forerunner. The 1938 invention of the Telescopic Watersuit in shirred elastic cotton ushered into the end the era of wool. Cotton sun-tops, printed with palm trees, and silk or rayon pyjamas, usually with a blouse top, became popular by 1939.\n\nSpeedo racerback silk suit that uncovered the shoulder blades almost resulted in disqualification of Clare Dennis at the 1932 Olympics, but became a norm by 1936. Meanwhile, men were allowed to swim in bare-chest suits in 1936, and in briefs only at the 1948 Olympics.\n\nWartime production during World War II required vast amounts of cotton, silk, nylon, wool, leather, and rubber. In 1942, the United States War Production Board issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10% reduction in the amount of fabric in women's beachwear. To comply with the regulations, swimsuit manufacturers produced two-piece suits with bare midriffs. The fabric shortage continued for some time after the end of the war.\n\nWomen's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Teen magazines of late 1940s and 1950s featured similar designs of midriff-baring suits and tops. However, midriff fashion was stated as only for beaches and informal events and considered indecent to be worn in public.\n\nBecause of the figure-hugging nature of these garments, glamour photography since the 1940s and 1950s has often featured people wearing swimsuits. This type of glamour photography eventually evolved into swimsuit photography exemplified by the annual \"Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue\". Beauty contests also required contestants to wear form-fitting swimsuits.\n\nTwo-piece swimsuits without the usual skirt panel and other superfluous material started appearing in the U.S. when the government ordered the 10% reduction in fabric used in woman's swimwear in 1943 as wartime rationing. By that time, two-piece swimsuits were ubiquitous on American beaches. The July 9, 1945, \"Life\" shows women in Paris wearing similar items. Hollywood stars like Ava Gardner, Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner tried similar swimwear or beachwear. Pin ups of Hayworth and Esther Williams in the costume were widely distributed. The most provocative swimsuit was the 1946 Moonlight Buoy, a bottom and a top of material that weighed only eight ounces. What made the Moonlight Buoy distinctive was a large cork buckle attached to the bottoms, which made it possible to tie the top to the cork buckle and splash around \"au naturel\" while keeping both parts of the suit afloat. \"Life\" magazine had a photo essay on the Moonlight Buoy and wrote, \"The name of the suit, of course, suggests the nocturnal conditions under which nude swimming is most agreeable.\"\n\nSwimwear of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s followed the silhouette mostly from the early 1930s whereas after World War II, a new wardrobe and style of vacation-swimwear arose, coupled with an increase of leisure time and bustling postwar resorts.\nIn 1951, A huge celebration called \"The Festival of Britain\" was promoted of everything new and modern and cast a line into the future, building on a feeling of hope. Beachwear style were very popular in U.S and Europe, but this fashion originated on the French Riviera, which people was quoted this place as \"A sunny place for shady people\". Keeping in line with the ultra-feminine look dominated by Dior which brought out his one and only collection of swimwear for the Cole of California in 1955. He designed a series of floral printed swimsuits with halter neckline style. It evolved into a dress followed his New Look silhouette with cinched waists and constructed bustlines, accessorized with earrings, bracelets, hats, scarves, sunglasses, hand bags and cover-ups. American Women inspired by Hollywood’s film stars For example, Doris Day offering a” girl-next-door’ look and the accession and coronation of the young Queen Elizabeth in February 1952 and June 1953 respectively.\n\nFor the Early 50s, despite the reaction to the 2-pieces swimsuit worn by Brigitte Bardot in Manina, the Girl in the Bikini in 1952, most women in the 1950s still wore one-piece suits. To increasing female emancipation and realized the commercial possibilities of beauty pageants, big companies launched beauty contests to find girls who could help promote products, believing that a picture of a pretty girl in a swimsuit was the best promotion. Instead of swimsuits, these contests popularized the playsuit, but swimsuits remained the highlight in the beauty contest.\n\nThe first bikinis appeared just after World War II. Early examples were not very different from the women's two pieces common since the 1920s, except that they had a gap below the breast line allowing for a section of bare midriff. They were named after Bikini Atoll, the site of several nuclear weapons tests, for their supposed explosive effect on the viewer. Beside Christian Dior, some designers also launched the swimwear collection, such as Bob and Bill Meistrell of body glove and Robert and Jack O’Neill of the surf brand O’Neill. Many of these pre-bikinis had fancy names like Double Entendre, Honey Child (to maximize small bosoms), Shipshape (to minimize large bosoms), Diamond Lil (trimmed with rhinestones and lace), Swimming In Mink (trimmed with fur across the bodice) and Spearfisherman (heavy poplin with a rope belt for carrying a knife), Beau Catcher, Leading Lady, Pretty Foxy, Side Issue, Forecast, and Fabulous Fit. However, the bikini was banned from the Miss World contest, following the crowning of Miss Sweden. Some people declared the bikini to be morally ‘indecent’. Even in Europe in 1950, there was an Italian magazine also declared that the Bikini should be worn purely for the sunbathing purposes or on board boats.\n\nAccording to \"Vogue\" the swimwear had become more of \"state of dress, not undress\" by the mid-1950s. Bikini had a colorful period on the cinema screens and made an impact in the late 50s, inspired by the film such as And God Created Woman by Roger Vadim, launched Bardot into the spotlight and became the benchmark for bikini on celluloid. Also, her outfit sets a whole new trend for sex symbols.\n\nStarting in the 1940s, the manufacturing advances enabled swimsuits to fit without the help of elastic, and aid as performance aid in competitive swimming. In the early 1950s, other synthetics beside the screen print technique was being developed, such as polyester and acrylic, with quick-drying properties. In U.S, the Hawaiian -Japanese- inspired prints were often used. In Europe, Emilio Pucci moved swimwear textile on a generation when he began to design prints for Rose Marrie Reid swimwear. By the late 1950s, new materials were developed and applied on the corsetry swimwear, such as Lastex, a fabric woven from artificial chromspun acetate that used for a more tightly fitted appearance. \n\nSpeedo produced the wool and cotton swimwear for the Melbourne Olympics in 1956. In 1956, Speedo became the first company to introduce nylon.\n\nMen's swimsuits developed roughly in parallel to women's during this period, with the shorts covering progressively less. Racing-style \"speedo\" suits became popular, as did thongs, G-strings, and bikini style briefs. Typically these are more popular in more tropical regions; however, they may also be worn at public swimming pools and inland lakes. But in the 1990s, longer and baggier shorts became popular, with the hems often reaching to the knees. Often called boardshorts and swim trunks, these were worn lower on the hips than regular shorts.\n\nIn 1964 designer Rudi Gernreich conceived and produced the monokini, a revolutionary and controversial design included a bottom that \"extended from the midriff to the upper thigh\" and was \"held up by shoestring laces that make a halter around the neck.\"\n\nIn the 1970s Speedo added elastane to their swimsuits that improved their elasticity, durability and reduced water drag – 21 out of 22 records at the 1972 Olympics were broken using nylon/elastane suits.\n\nAt the same Olympics, East German swimmers adopted suits that were tightly following the body shape, the so-called \"skinsuits\". They were initially made of cotton and became virtually transparent when wet. The revealing shape and transparency caused outrage among US swimmers; meanwhile, at the 1973 World Aquatics Championships, East German women won 10 of 14 events and set seven world records. Those championships became the turning point for the world to adopt the skinsuit, modified with novel synthetic materials, as a standard competitive swimwear.\n\nDuring the same era, East Germany became noteworthy for its nude beaches, an unusual freedom allowed in the regimented communist bloc.\n\nIn 1985, Gernreich unveiled the lesser known pubikini, a bathing suit meant to expose pubic hair. The pubikini is a small piece of fabric that hugs the hips and buttocks but leaves the pubic region exposed, described as a tiny V-shaped fabric strip and a piece de resistance totally freeing the human body. It featured a thong-style bottom while the front was a tiny V-shaped strip of fabric that dipped below the woman's mons pubis, exposing her pubic hair and portions of her vulva. This was his last design, four weeks before his death.\n\nTankini and the concept of mix-and-match swimwears were the two major innovations in that genre in the late 1990s. Designer Anne Cole, the US swimwear mogul, was the originator of this style. Hailed as the first major innovation in women's swimsuit design in several decades, the two-piece tankini blended the freedom of a bikini with the more modest coverage of a one-piece bathing suit, and quickly captured nearly a third of the swimwear market. Aimed at closing a gap in the swimwear market, the popularity of tankini largely came from Cole's tapping into women's anxieties about swimwear. In the years following its introduction tankinis diversified in style and range, adding other big name designers such as Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Nautica, and Calvin Klein.\n\nIn 2005, a controversy broke out when Buddhists complained against swimwear manufacturer Ondade Mar and lingerie giant Victoria's Secret started marketing tankinis featuring Buddhist iconography. In the same year Nike's breast cancer awareness swimwear collection featured four different cuts of tankini.\n\nIn 2000, Speedo launched the Fastskin suit series that mimicked shark skin. Their surface contained bumps and ridges that channeled the water over the swimmer's body approximately 3% more efficiently than traditional materials. Those suits covered most of the body, from neck to ankles and wrists, and their shape was optimized for specific swimming strokes, compressing some body parts while allowing more freedom to the others. Those suits were approved for the 2000 Olympics, where they helped win 83% of the medals. By the next Olympics, similar suits had been developed by Tyr Sport, Inc., but they were not approved by the FINA.\n\nIn July 2009, FINA voted to ban non-textile (non-woven) swimsuits in competitive events from 2010. The new policy was implemented to combat the issues associated with performance enhancing costumes, hindering the ability to accurately measure the performance of swimmers. Subsequently, the new ruling states that men's swimsuits may maximally cover the area from the navel to the knee, and women's' counterparts from the shoulder to the knee.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "505366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505366", "title": "In Search of... (TV series)", "text": "In Search of... (TV series)\n\nIn Search of... is an American television series that was broadcast weekly from 1977 to 1982, devoted to mysterious phenomena. It was created after the success of three one-hour TV documentaries produced by creator Alan Landsburg: \"In Search of Ancient Astronauts\" in 1973 (based on the book \"Chariots of the Gods?\" by Erich von Däniken), \"In Search of Ancient Mysteries\" and \"The Outer Space Connection\", both in 1975 (later adapted into popular paperbacks written by Landsburg). All three featured narration by Rod Serling, who was the initial choice to host the spin-off show. Serling died before production started, with Leonard Nimoy then selected to be the host. The series was revived with host Mitch Pileggi in 2002 and again in 2018 with Zachary Quinto, currently airing on the History Channel.\n\nThe program conducted investigations into the controversial and paranormal (e.g., UFOs, Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness Monster). Additionally, it featured episodes about mysterious historical events and personalities such as Anna Anderson/Grand Duchess Anastasia, the Lincoln Assassination, the Jack the Ripper murders, infamous cults (e.g., Jim Jones), and missing persons, cities, and ships (e.g., Amelia Earhart, Jimmy Hoffa, D. B. Cooper, the \"Mary Celeste\", the \"Titanic\", the lost Roanoke Colony). Because the show often presented offbeat subjects and controversial theories, each episode's opening credits included a verbal disclaimer about the conjectural nature of the evidence and theories to be presented:\n\nThe production values were fairly typical of the period, with interviews, reenactments and scenic footage shot on film, all voiced over by Nimoy. The music was composed by Laurin M. Rinder and W. Michael Lewis. A soundtrack album was released on AVI (American Variety International) Records in 1977.\n\nNimoy's popularity among science fiction fans (due to his role as Spock in the original \"\" television series) won the show a following in fandom circles. Nimoy wrote an episode about the turbulent life of artist Vincent van Gogh, having earlier played the artist's brother Theo in a one-man show. As part of his research, Nimoy found records in the archives of the hospital where Van Gogh was treated that suggested that he suffered from epilepsy rather than insanity.\n\nThe show also spawned at least six spin-off books, all written by Landsburg with forewords by Nimoy: \"In Search of Lost Civilizations,\" \"In Search of Extraterrestrials,\" \"In Search of Magic and Witchcraft,\" \"In Search of Strange Phenomena,\" \"In Search of Missing Persons,\" and \"In Search of Myths and Monsters,\" with an additional book that collected the best segments from these existing volumes.\n\nIn 1978, Landsburg produced a Bigfoot documentary using portions of two \"In Search of...\" episodes (\"The Monster Hunters\" and \"The Yeti\") called \"Manbeast! Myth or Monster,\" based on his book \"In Search of Myths and Monsters.\" Though Nimoy had written the foreword to Landsburg's book, he did not narrate this documentary.\n\nReruns of the \"In Search of...\" series aired during the early 1990s on the A&E Network. In the later 1990s, the show aired on another of the A&E Television Networks' properties, the History Channel. The licensing agreement expired in the early 2000s, ending the show's run. When the show aired on A&E, a re-recording of the original theme music was used plus a new alternate theme. The original opening titles were also modernized. In this incarnation virtually all of Nimoy's on-camera appearances in the series were replaced with reused footage, so viewers could hear Nimoy but not see him.\n\nA short-lived revival of the show, featuring Mitch Pileggi, aired on the Sci-Fi Channel in 2002.\n\nIn January 2018, it was announced that Zachary Quinto, who, like Nimoy, stars as Spock in the rebooted \"Star Trek\" films, will host the revived version of the show on History Channel.\n\nThe original series ran for six seasons.\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Visual Entertainment, under license from Universal Studios, had acquired the home video rights to the original series for the United States and Canada. \"In Search of: The Complete Collection\" was released in Canada and the U.S. on December 11, 2012 from VEI's website.\n\nThe 21-DVD set includes all 144 installments hosted by Leonard Nimoy. Also included are two Rod Serling specials: \"In Search of Ancient Astronauts\" and \"In Search of Ancient Mysteries\" which aired prior to the start of the regular Nimoy series. Three Landsburg specials, \"The Outer Space Connection\", \"Secrets of the Bermuda Triangle\" and \"Manbeast! Myth or Monster\", are not included.

{"id": "192415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192415", "title": "Japanese era name", "text": "Japanese era name\n\nThe , also known as , is the first of the two elements that identify years in the Japanese era calendar scheme. The second element, a number, counts the years since the era began; as in many other systems, there is no year zero. For example, the first year of the Heisei period was , or \"Heisei 1\", so the year 2018 CE in this scheme is \"Heisei 30\".\n\nAs elsewhere in East Asia, the use of \"nengō\" was originally derived from Chinese Imperial practice, although the Japanese system is independent of the Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese era-naming systems. Unlike some of these other similar systems, Japanese era names are still in use. Government offices usually require era names and years for official papers.\n\nThe four era names used since the end of the Edo period in 1868 can be abbreviated by taking the first letter of their romanized names. For example, S55 means Shōwa 55 (i.e. 1980), and H22 stands for Heisei 22 (2010). At 62 years and 2 weeks, Shōwa is the longest era to date.\n\nThe current period is known as . It started on 8 January 1989, the day after the death of the Emperor Hirohito. His son, the 125th Emperor Akihito, acceded to the throne. It is scheduled to end on 30 April 2019, his planned date of Abdication.\n\nThe system on which the Japanese era names are based originated in China in 140 BCE, and was adopted by Japan in 645 CE, during the reign of Emperor Kōtoku.\n\nThe first era name to be assigned was , celebrating the political and organizational changes which were to flow from the great of 645. Although the regular practice of proclaiming successive era names was interrupted in the late seventh century, it was permanently re-adopted in 701 during the reign of Emperor Monmu (697–707). Since then, era names have been used continuously up through the present day.\n\nPrior to the Meiji period, era names were decided by court officials and were subjected to frequent change. A new era name was usually proclaimed within a year or two after the ascension of a new emperor. A new era name was also often designated on the first, fifth and 58th years of the sexagenary cycle, because they were inauspicious years in Onmyōdō. These three years are respectively known as \"kakurei\", \"kakuun\", and \"kakumei\", and collectively known as \"sankaku\". Era names were also changed due to other felicitous events or natural disasters.\n\nIn historical practice, starts whenever the emperor chooses; and the first year continues until the next lunar new year, which is understood to be the start of the nengō's second year.\n\nEra names indicate the various reasons for their adoption. For instance, the nengō , during the Nara period, was declared due to the discovery of copper deposits in Chichibu. Most nengō are composed of two kanji, except for a short time during the Nara period when four-kanji names were sometimes adopted to follow the Chinese trend. , , and are some famous nengō names that use four characters. Since the Heian period, Confucian thoughts and ideas have been reflected in era names, such as , and . Although there currently exist a total of 247 Japanese era names, only 72 kanji have been used in composing them. Out of these 72 kanji, 30 of them have been used only once, while the rest have been used repeatedly in different combinations.\n\nMutsuhito assumed the throne in 1867, during the third year of the era. On 23 October 1868, the era name was changed to , and a system was adopted, wherein era names would change only upon immediate imperial succession. This system is similar to the now-defunct Chinese system used since the days of the Ming Dynasty. The Japanese nengō system differs from Chinese practice, in that in the Chinese system the era name was not updated until the year following the emperor's death.\n\nIn modern practice, starts immediately upon the emperor's accession and ends on 31 December. Subsequent years follow the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor example, the Meiji Era lasted until 30 July 1912, when the Emperor died and the era was proclaimed. 1912 is therefore known as both \"Meiji 45\" and , although Meiji technically ended on 30 July with Mutsuhito's death.\n\nThis practice, implemented successfully since the days of Meiji but never formalized, became law in 1979 with the passage of the . Thus, since 1868, there have only been four era names assigned: Meiji, Taishō, Shōwa and Heisei, each corresponding with the rule of only one emperor. Upon death, the emperor is thereafter referred to by the era of his reign. For example, Mutsuhito is posthumously known as .\nIt is protocol in Japan that the reigning emperor be referred to as or . To call the current emperor by the current era name, i.e. \"Heisei\", even in English, is a faux pas, as this is—and will be—his posthumous name. Use of the emperor's given name (i.e., \"Akihito\") is rare, and is considered vulgar behaviour in Japanese.\n\nThe current Emperor is scheduled to abdicate on 30 April 2019, necessating a change in nengō. It is believed that the new name will be made public in advance.\n\nThe era name system that was introduced by Emperor Kōtoku was abandoned after his death; no era names were designated between 654 and 686. The system was briefly reinstated by Emperor Tenmu in 686, but was again abandoned upon his death about two months later. In 701, Emperor Monmu once again reinstated the era name system, and it has continued uninterrupted through today.\n\nAlthough use of the Gregorian calendar for historical dates became increasingly common in Japan, the traditional Japanese system demands that dates be written in reference to era names. The apparent problem introduced by the lack of era names was resolved by identifying the years of an imperial reign as a period.\n\nAlthough in modern Japan posthumous imperial names correspond with the eras of their reign, this is a relatively recent concept, introduced in practice during the Meiji period and instituted by law in 1979. Therefore, the posthumous names of the emperors and empresses who reigned prior to 1868 may not be taken as era names by themselves. For example, the year 572—the year in which Emperor Bidatsu assumed the Chrysanthemum Throne – is properly written as \"\" (\"Bidatsu-Tennō Gannen\", lit. \"the first year of Emperor Bidatsu\"), and not \"\" (\"Bidatsu Gannen\", lit. \"the first year of Bidatsu\"), although it may be abbreviated as such. By incorporating both proper era names and posthumous imperial names in this manner, it is possible to extend the nengō system to cover all dates from 660 BCE through today.\n\nIn addition to the official era name system, in which the era names are selected by the imperial court, one also observes—primarily in the ancient documents and epigraphs of shrines and temples—unofficial era names called , also known as or . Currently, there are over 40 confirmed shinengō, most of them dating from the middle ages. \"Shinengō\" used prior to the reestablishment of the era name system in 701 are usually called . A list of shinengō and more information can be seen in the Japanese language entry on .\n\nBecause official records of \"shinengō\" are lacking, the range of dates to which they apply is often unclear. For example, the well-known itsunengō is normally said to refer to 650–654 CE; a poetic synonym for the Hakuchi era. However, alternate interpretations exist. For example, in the Nichūreki, Hakuhō refers to 661–683 CE, and in some medieval temple documents, Hakuhō refers to 672–685 CE. Thus, shinengō may be used as an alternative way of dating periods for which there is no official era name.\n\nOther well-known \"itsunengō\" and \"shinengō\" include (591–621+ CE), (686), (1489–1492), (1506–1507 or 1507–1509) and (1540–1543).\n\nThe most recent \"shinengō\" is (1904–1905), named for the Russo-Japanese War.\n\nEdo period scholar Tsurumine Shikenobu proposed that , said to have been used in ancient Kumaso, should also be considered a form of \"shinengō\". This claim is not generally recognized by the academic community. Lists of the proposed \"Kyūshū nengō\" can be seen in the Japanese language entries and .\n\nSince the release of Java 8, the Japanese calendar is supported in the new Date and time API for the year Meiji 6 (1873) onwards.\n\nWith a new era anticipated to begin on 1 May, 2019, computers and software manufacturers will need to test their systems for the new era. Windows provides a test mechanism to simulate a new era ahead of time. Java Development Kit 11 supports this era using the placeholders \"元号\" for Japanese, \"NewEra\" for other languages. The final name will be added in JDK 12.0.1, once it is announced by the Japanese government.\n\nUnicode code point U+32FF has been reserved for representing the new era name.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16031504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16031504", "title": "Joint criminal enterprise", "text": "Joint criminal enterprise\n\nJoint criminal enterprise (JCE) is a legal doctrine used during war crimes tribunals to allow the prosecution of members of a group for the actions of the group. This doctrine considers each member of an organized group individually responsible for crimes committed by group within the common plan or purpose. It arose through the application of the idea of common purpose and has been applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to prosecute political and military leaders for mass war crimes, including genocide, committed during the Yugoslav Wars 1991–1999.\n\nFor example, \"if three people commit a bank robbery and one fatally shoots a person in the process, the law considers all guilty of murder\". The concept of \"collective liability\" where more than one person can share liability and punishment for the actions of another person is not universally accepted and is considered by some to be a form of human rights abuse, while others believe it is just.\n\nThe first usages of joint criminal enterprise doctrine are identified in post-World War II cases, in which the doctrine was used under the name common purpose (or joint enterprise), or without specific naming.\n\nHowever, the origins of the doctrine may be influenced by the Common Law of England, which introduced the principle into criminal law in the UK and other Commonwealth nations such as Australia. A similar legal principle can also be found in Texas, USA, where it is known as the Law of Parties. The notion of collective liability and shared punishment for the actions of others as if all perpetrated the same deed may be much older, and was used to justify extermination of religious and cultural groups, such as the Albigensian \"Heretics\" and those who harbored them. Critics argue that Joint Criminal Enterprise can lead to excessive legal process and punishments, that it lowers the evidential bar in favour of prosecution, and that it runs counter to the spirit of Blackstone's formulation. Supporters argue that it ensures those contributing to or instigating a criminal act are properly made to account for their involvement.\n\nThe first reference to joint criminal enterprise and its constituent elements was provided in Tadic case 1999.\n\nThe Appeals Chamber of the ICTY decided on 21 May 2003 on the following definitions:\nWriting about this finding in the Journal of International Criminal Justice in 2004, Steven Powles (a barrister who has appeared as a defence council in matters before the ICTY and the Special Court for Sierra Leone) states that the Appeals Chamber was obliged to make this declaration because there was no specific mention of \"joint criminal enterprise\" in the court's statutes and that \"this is not ideal [because] criminal law, especially international criminal law, requires clear and certain definitions of the various bases of liability, so as to enable the parties, both the prosecution and, perhaps more importantly, the defence to prepare for and conduct the trial.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the courts established by British and United States in Germany applied this doctrine in the trials against Nazis. The Italian Supreme Court applied a similar doctrine in the trials against fascists.\n\nPossibly, the most well-known post World War II cases are the Dachau Concentration Camp case, decided by a United States court, and the Belsen case, decided by a British military court, both sitting in Germany. In these cases, the accused held position of authority within the hierarchy of the Nazi concentration camps and based on that were found guilty of the charges that they had acted in pursuance of a common plan to kill or mistreat prisoners.\n\nThe Essen lynching case, conducted before a British military court, demonstrates the closest link to the joint criminal enterprise doctrine. In that case three British airmen prisoners of war had been lynched by a mob of Germans in the Essen on 13 December 1944.\n\nSeven persons were charged with committing a war crime, included a German captain, who had placed prisoners under the escort of a German soldier. While the escort with the prisoners was leaving, the captain had ordered him not to interfere if German civilians molested the prisoners. This order had been given in a loud voice so that the gathering crowd could hear. When the prisoners of war were marched through one of the main streets of Essen, the crowd grew bigger, started hitting them and throwing stones. When they reached the bridge, the prisoners were thrown over the parapet of the bridge; one of the airmen was killed by the fall and the two others were killed by members of the crowd.\n\nThe use of the JCE as an actual criminal investigation and prosecution theory first appeared at the ICTY through a written proposal to Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte, which was developed and authored by American prosecutor Dermot Groome, at the time the legal officer for the Bosnia case, and American Investigator John Cencich, head of the Milosevic investigation for crimes alleged to have been committed in Croatia. Cencich provides an in-depth look at the actual development of the investigation and prosecution theory of the JCE in his doctoral dissertation at the University of Notre Dame, in the International Criminal Justice Review, and his book, \"The Devil's Garden: A War Crimes Investigator's Story\".\n\nThe ICTY prosecutor indicted Slobodan Milosevic on three separate indictments which on appeal they successfully pleaded to the ICTY Appeals Chamber should considered as one indictment. As the prosecution had not used the same language in all three indictments it was left to the Court of Appeal to decide if the alleged criminal enterprises in the three indictments were one of the same and what was common between the allegations. The Appeals count decided that:\nMilosevic died during the trial, but he was still found to have been a part of a joint criminal enterprise in the verdicts against Milan Martić and Milan Babić, who publicly admitted his own (and Milosevic's) guilt.\n\nAccording to the ICTY prosecutors indictment, Milutinović \"et al\", Nikola Šainović, Nebojša Pavković and Sreten Lukić, along with others, participated in a joint criminal enterprise to modify the ethnic balance in Kosovo in order to ensure continued control by the FRY and Serbian authorities over the province. On 26 February 2009, the court returned a verdicts that:\n\nOn 27 May 2009, the Prosecution filed its notice of appeal in respect of all of the accused except Milan Milutinovië. On the same day, all Defence teams filed their notices of appeal.\n\nICTY found in a first-instance verdict that general Ante Gotovina participated in a joint criminal enterprise with Croatian President Franjo Tuđman with the goal to do \"the forcible and permanent removal of the Serb population from the [territory occupied by the forces of the] Republic of Serbian Krajina\". Nevertheless, ICTY's appeals chamber acquitted Ante Gotovina, Ivan Čermak and Mladen Markač of all charges, including the one of participation in the joint criminal enterprise.\n\nIn May 2013, Jadranko Prlić and others were found guilty for taking part in the joint criminal enterprise with Croatian President Franjo Tuđman for crimes committed in the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia against Muslims. However, on 19 July 2016, the Appeals Chamber concluded that the \"Trial Chamber made no explicit findings concerning [Tuđman's] participation in the joint criminal enterprise and did not find [him] guilty of any crimes.\" \n\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) is an international court established in November 1994 by the United Nations Security Council in order to judge people responsible for the Rwandan genocide and other serious violations of the international law in Rwanda, or by Rwandan citizens in nearby states, between 1 January and 31 December 1994.\n\nAt the Rwanda trials, the Prosecution originally alleged that the genocidal common plan had been drawn up in 1990 but this theory was dismissed in December 2008 when the defendants in the mammoth \"Military I\" trial were acquitted of conspiracy to commit genocide.\n\nJohn Laughland, author of \"Travesty: The Trial of Slobodan Milosevic and the Corruption of International Justice\", criticized the Joint Criminal Enterprise doctrine. He stated that successive rulings of the ICTY Appeals Chamber have allowed this doctrine \"to get wildly out of hand\". The judgement in Kvocka ruled that \"JCE responsibility does not require any showing of superior responsibility, nor the proof of a substantial or significant contribution.\" In Brdjanin, it ruled that \"the third category of joint criminal enterprise does not require proof of intent to commit a crime.\"\n\nHe argues thus that \"international tribunals have abolished the very thing which criminal trials are supposed to be about. If you can be convicted of a crime as a primary perpetrator for something which you neither committed nor intended to commit, and if mens rea can be ‘established’ by judicial ruling,\" this is \"introducing into the heart of their systems measures which are the very hallmark of dictatorships.\" The chapter in Laughland's book \"Travesty\" on the subject of the Joint Criminal Enterprise doctrine is titled \"Just convict everyone.\"\n\nLaughland is not alone in criticizing the application of this doctrine. Torunn Salomonsen has taken a similar position in her Ph.D. thesis http://sciencenordic.com/due-process-law-toned-down-international-criminal-courts\n\nJoint Criminal Enterprise is found in some nations and states and may have its roots in the Common Law of England, where its application has prompted the formation in 2011 of a campaign group JENGbA http://www.jointenterprise.co - JENGbA seeks to curtail the use of Joint Enterprise and claims its misuse constitutes a human rights abuse.\nJoint Criminal Enterprise as a legal concept has been used at the ICTY and - to a lesser extent - at the ICTR, as well as in the Special Court for Sierra Leone. But it is not part of the International Criminal Court's (ICC) Rome Statute. The ICC instead uses the notion of co-perpetratorship, which a number of ICTY judges had tried to introduce at the ICTY instead of JCE.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6860191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6860191", "title": "Language localisation", "text": "Language localisation\n\nLanguage localisation (or localization, see spelling-differences) is the process of adapting a product that has been previously translated into multiple languages to a specific country or region (from Latin \"locus\" (place) and the English term \"locale\", \"a place where something happens or is set\"). It is the second phase of a larger process of product translation and cultural adaptation (for specific countries, regions, or groups) to account for differences in distinct markets, a process known as internationalisation and localisation.\nLanguage localisation differs from translation activity because it involves a comprehensive study of the target culture in order to correctly adapt the product to local needs. Localisation can be referred to by the numeronym L10N (as in: \"L\", followed by ten more letters, and then \"N\").\n\nThe localisation process is most generally related to the cultural adaptation and translation of software, video games, and websites, as well as audio/voiceover, video, or other multimedia content, and less frequently to any written translation (which may also involve cultural adaptation processes). Localisation can be done for regions or countries where people speak different languages or where the same language is spoken. For instance, different dialects of German, with different idioms, are spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Belgium.\n\nThe former Localization Industry Standards Association (LISA) said that globalisation \"can best be thought of as a cycle rather than a single process\". To \"globalise\" is to plan the design and development methods for a product in advance, keeping in mind a multicultural audience, in order to avoid increased costs and quality problems, save time, and smooth the localising effort for each region or country. Localisation is an integral part of the overall process called globalisation.\n\nThere are two primary technical processes that comprise globalisation: internationalisation and localisation.\n\nThe first phase, internationalisation, encompasses the planning and preparation stages for a product that is built by design to support global markets. This process removes all cultural assumptions, and any country- or language-specific content is stored so that it can be easily adapted. If this content is not separated during this phase, it must be fixed during localisation, adding time and expense to the project. In extreme cases, products that were not internationalised may not be localisable.\n\nThe second phase, localisation, refers to the actual adaptation of the product for a specific market. The localisation phase involves, among other things, the four issues LISA describes as \"linguistic\", \"physical\", \"business and cultural\", and \"technical\" issues.\n\nAt the end of each phase, testing (including quality assurance) is performed to ensure that the product works properly and meets the client's quality expectations.\n\nThough it is sometimes difficult to draw the limits between translation and localisation, in general localisation addresses significant, non-textual components of products or services. In addition to translation (and, therefore, grammar and spelling issues that vary from place to place where the same language is spoken), the localisation process might include adapting graphics; adopting local currencies; using proper format for date and time, addresses, and phone numbers applicable to the location; the choices of colours; cultural references; and many other details, including rethinking the physical structure of a product. All these changes aim to recognise local sensitivities, avoid conflict with local culture, customs, common habits, and enter the local market by merging into its needs and desires. For example, localisation aims to offer country-specific websites of the same company or different editions of a book depending on where it is published. It must be kept in mind that a political entity such as a country is not the same as a language or culture; even in countries where there exists a substantially identical relationship between a language and a political entity, there are almost certainly multiple cultures and multiple minority languages even if the minority languages are spoken by transient populations. For instance, Japan's national language is Japanese and is the primary language for over 99% of the population, but the country also recognises 11 languages officially, others are spoken by transient populations, and others are spoken as second or other languages.\n\nWhereas localisation is the process of adapting one product to a particular locale, globalisation designs the product to minimise the extra work required for each localisation.\n\nSuppose that a company operating exclusively in Germany chooses to open a major office in Russia and needs a Russian-language website. The company offers the same products and services in both countries with minor differences, but perhaps some elements that appeared in the original website intended for a German audience are offensive or upsetting in Russia (use of flags, colours, nationalistic images, songs, etc.). Thus, that company might lose a potential market because of small details of presentation.\n\nFurthermore, this company might need to adapt the product to its new buyers; video games are the best example.\n\nNow, suppose instead that this company has major offices in a dozen countries and needs a specifically designed website in each of these countries. Before deciding how to localise the website and the products offered in any given country, a professional in the area might advise the company to create an overall strategy: to globalise the way the organisation does business. The company might want to design a framework to codify and support this global strategy. The globalisation strategy and the globalisation framework would provide uniform guidance for the twelve separate localisation efforts.\n\nGlobalisation is especially important in mitigating extra work involved in the long-term cycle of localisation. Because localisation is a cycle and not a one-time project, there will always be new texts, updates, and projects to localise. For example, as the original website is updated over time, each of the localised websites already translated will also need to be updated. This cycle of work is continuous as long as the original project continues to evolve. It is therefore important for globalisation processes to be created and streamlined in order to implement ongoing changes. \n\nTranslation memory (TM) technology that exists in various translation software platforms can aid in this specific aspect of the globalisation process.\n\nLanguage codes are closely related to the localising process because they indicate the locales involved in the translation and adaptation of the product. They are used in various contexts; for example, they might be informally used in a document published by the European Union or they might be introduced in HTML element under the lang attribute. In the case of the European Union style guide, the language codes are based on the ISO 639-1 alpha-2 code; in HTML, the language tags are generally defined within the Internet Engineering Task Force's \"Best Current Practice\" (BCP) 47. The decision to use one type of code or tag versus another depends upon the nature of the project and any requirements set out for the localisation specialist.\n\nMost frequently, there is a primary sub-code that identifies the language (e.g., \"en\"), and an optional sub-code in capital letters that specifies the national variety (e.g., \"GB\" or \"US\" according to ISO 3166-2). The sub-codes are typically linked with a hyphen, though in some contexts it's necessary to substitute this with an underscore.\n\nThere are multiple language tag systems available for language codification. For example, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) specifies both two- and three-letter codes to represent languages in standards ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2, respectively.\n\n\nthailand\n\n"}

He also received a Guggenheim Fellowship.\n\nAfter the spring 2007 semester he retired to emeritus status at the University of California Berkeley, where he received the Golden Apple Award for Outstanding Teaching that year. Then he went on a lecture tour that led to his latest book, \"How Free Is Free?: The Long Death of Jim Crow\" (2009).\n\nLitwack was born in Santa Barbara, California, in 1929, and received his B.A. in 1951 and Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of California, Berkeley. He has taught at the University of Wisconsin, University of South Carolina, and Colorado College.\n\nLitwack's interest in history was sparked by \"The Growth of the American Republic\", by Samuel Eliot Morison and Henry Steele Commager (1930). Litwack said, \"The textbook was my first confrontation with history. I asked my 11th grade teacher for the opportunity to respond to the textbook's version of Reconstruction, to what I thought were distortions and racial biases. (I had already read Howard Fast's \"Freedom Road\".) The research led me to the library—and to W. E. B. Du Bois's \"Black Reconstruction\", with that intriguing subtitle: \"An Essay Toward a History of the Part which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860–1880.\" Armed with that book, I presented what I thought to be a persuasive rebuttal of the textbook.\"\n\nHistorian Michael Les Benedict wrote that in 1961 \"Leon Litwack showed how the federal government's pervasive support for slavery led to shameful treatment of free African Americans.\" Benedict was referring to pages 30–63 of chapter 2, titled \"The Federal Government and the Free Negro\" in Litwack's book, \"North of Slavery: The Negro in the Free States, 1790-1860\".\n\nIn 1964-2007 Litwack taught at the University of California in Berkeley, where he became the Alexander F. and May T.

He is one of the early creators of the Serbian critical historiographical school and fighters for the separation of historical science from tradition. Kovačević directly influenced the political and cultural activity of Serbia at the end of the nineteenth century. He and Ljubomir Jovanović were the authors of the well-known two-volume \"Istorija srpskog naroda za srednje škole\" (History of the Serbian People for the Secondary Schools) in the Kingdom of Serbia. Both Kovačević and Jovanović were Ministers of Education at one time and, as historians, using a wealth of verified information, professionally and convincingly refuted many myths that were passed down through the ages.\n\nKovačević was born in the village of Petnica in the Principality of Serbia on 4 January 1848. His father was Mihailo Kovačević, the Serbian Orthodox parish priest of Petnica, and his mother Vasilija was the daughter of professor Janićije Popović. Kovačević was educated at the Gymnasium of Šabac and the Belgrade Great School, Grandes écoles; he took his degree in 1870, afterwards was employed as lecturer at a college in Negotin and a year later he joined the staff of a teacher's college in Kragujevac before it was relocated to Belgrade. Later, he became a professor of history at his \"alma mater\" and rector of the University of Belgrade (former Great School). Kovačević chose to specialize in history because of his desire to be involved in the developing field of critical historiography.\n\nKovačević had five daughters and a son, Vladeta Kovačević (1882–1912), former student of the University of Paris. At the Battle of Kumanovo, where he commanded the \"Mitrailleuses\" (machineguns), Vladeta was killed. His body was brought back to Belgrade. On the day of the funeral his mother and five sisters wept and groaned aloud. At the grave the old father without a tear made a moving speech:\n\nKovačević fought in the Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–78). He died at Vrnjačka Banja on 19 November 1918.\n\nIn 1888 Ljubomir Kovačević wrote a treatise on \"Vuk Branković, 1372–1398\" while Ilarion Ruvarac, coincidence would have it, wrote a treatise on \"Prince Lazar\" at the same time. Both of them, through a scholarly analysis of the sources and by applying existing principles of historiographic critique, omitted anything that was not verifiable by well-informed sources close to the event under study. In this manner, the story of the Battle of Kosovo was stripped of many picturesque details, the most important among them being the betrayal of Vuk Branković (Ćirković 1990: 115–116). These two scholars, independently of one another, came to the conclusion that Vuk Branković had not been a traitor in Kosovo, after all. A polemic soon arose between Panta Srećković and Russian Slavist Vladimir Vasiljević Kačanovski (1853–1901) who defended the thesis that historical truths should have other tasks besides purely scientific ones. In the end, Kovačević and Ruvarac succeeded to tear down the ruling school of Panta Srećković and Vladimir Kačanovski with the aid of Konstantin Jireček who also proved that Vuk Branković was not a traitor, and that Uroš died three months after King Vukašin, in December 1371, all thanks to the archives of Dubrovnik. These were but a few of the many myths that were put to rest, finally.\nKovačević also wrote \"Nekoliko Hronološki Popravka U Srpskoj Istoriji\" (1880) among a score of other scholastic and academic works.\n\n\n\nSerbian Academy of Arts and Sciences: http://www.sanu.ac.rs/English/Clanstvo/IstClan.aspx?arg=251,\n"}

The Tetrarchy ended with the Battle of Chrysopolis (Üsküdar) in 324, when Constantine defeated Licinius and became the sole emperor. In 330 Constantine chose for himself the nearby Byzantium (which was renamed Constantinople, modern Istanbul) as the new capital of the Roman Empire.\n\nIt was founded in 712/11 BC as a Megarian colony and was originally known as Astacus (; Ancient Greek: Ἀστακός, \"lobster\"). After being destroyed by Lysimachus, it was rebuilt by Nicomedes I of Bithynia in 264 BC under the name of Nicomedia, and has ever since been one of the most important cities in northwestern Asia Minor. The great military commander Hannibal Barca came to Nicomedia in his final years and committed suicide in nearby Libyssa (Diliskelesi, Gebze). The historian Arrian was born there.\nNicomedia was the metropolis and capital of the Roman province of Bithynia under the Roman Empire. It is referenced repeatedly in Pliny the Younger's Epistles to Trajan during his tenure as governor of Bithynia. Diocletian made it the eastern capital city of the Roman Empire in 286 when he introduced the Tetrarchy system.\n\nNicomedia was at the center of the Diocletianic Persecution of Christians which occurred under Diocletian and his Caesar Galerius. On 23 February 303 AD, the pagan festival of the Terminalia, Diocletian ordered that the newly-built church at Nicomedia be razed, its scriptures burnt, and its precious stones seized. The next day he issued his \"First Edict Against the Christians,\" which ordered similar measures to be taken at churches across the Empire.\n\nThe destruction of the Nicomedia church incited panic in the city, and at the end of the month a fire destroyed part of Diocletian's palace, followed 16 days later by another fire. Although an investigation was made into the cause of the fires, no party was officially charged, but Galerius placed the blame on the Christians. He oversaw the execution of two palace eunuchs, who he claimed conspired with the Christians to start the fire, followed by six more executions through the end of April 303. Soon after Galerius declared Nicomedia to be unsafe and ostentatiously departed the city for Rome, followed soon after by Diocletian.\n\nNicomedia remained as the eastern (and most senior) capital of the Roman Empire until co-emperor Licinius was defeated by Constantine the Great at the Battle of Chrysopolis (Üsküdar) in 324. Constantine mainly resided in Nicomedia as his interim capital city for the next six years, until in 330 he declared the nearby Byzantium (which was renamed Constantinople) the new capital. Constantine died in a royal villa in the vicinity of Nicomedia in 337. Owing to its position at the convergence of the Asiatic roads leading to the new capital, Nicomedia retained its importance even after the foundation of Constantinople.\n\nA major earthquake, however, on 24 August 358, caused extensive devastation to Nicomedia, and was followed by a fire which completed the catastrophe. Nicomedia was rebuilt, but on a smaller scale. In the sixth century under Emperor Justinian I the city was extended with new public buildings. Situated on the roads leading to the capital, the city remained a major military center, playing an important role in the Byzantine campaigns against the Caliphate.\n\nIn 451, the local bishopric was promoted to a Metropolitan see under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The metropolis of Nicomedia was ranked 7th in the \"Notitiae Episcopatuum\" among the metropolises of the patriarchate. In the eighth century the Emperor Constantine V established his court there for a time, when plague broke out in Constantinople and drove him from his capital in 746–47. From the 840s on, Nicomedia was the capital of the \"thema\" of the \"Optimatoi\". By that time, most of the old, seawards city had been abandoned and is described by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurdadhbih as lying in ruins, with settlement restricted to the hilltop citadel. In the 1080s, the city served as the main military base for Alexios I Komnenos in his campaigns against the Seljuk Turks, and the First and Second Crusades both encamped there.\n\nThe city was briefly held by the Latin Empire following the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204: in late 1206 the seneschal Thierry de Loos made it his base, converting the church of Saint Sophia into a fortress; however, the Crusader stronghold was subjected to constant raids by the Emperor of Nicaea Theodore I Laskaris, during which de Loos was captured by Nicaean soldiers; by the summer of 1207 Emperor Henry of Flanders agreed to evacuate Nicomedia in exchange for de Loos and other prisoners Emperor Theodore held. The city remained in Byzantine control for over a century after that, but following the Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Bapheus in 1302, it was threatened by the rising Ottoman beylik. The city was twice blockaded by the Ottomans (in 1304 and 1330) before finally succumbing in 1337.\n\nDuring the Empire, Nicomedia was a cosmopolitan and commercially prosperous city which received all the amenities appropriate for a major Roman city. Nicomedia was well known for having a bountiful water supply from two to three aqueducts, one of which was built in Hellenistic times. Pliny the Younger complains in his \"epistulae\" to Trajan, written in 110 AD, that the Nicomedians wasted 3,518,000 sesterces on an unfinished aqueduct which twice ran into engineering troubles. Trajan instructs him to take steps to complete the aqueduct, and to investigate possible official corruption behind the large waste of money. Under Trajan, there was also a large Roman garrison. Other public amenities included a theatre, a colonnaded street typical of Hellenistic cities and a forum.\n\nThe major religious shrine was a temple of Demeter, which stood in a sacred precinct on a hill above the harbor. The city adopted official cults of Rome avidly, there were temples dedicated to the Emperor Commodus, a sacred precinct of the city dedicated to Octavian, and a temple of Roma dedicated during the late-Republic.\n\nThe city was sacked in AD 253 by the Goths, but when Diocletian made the city his capital in 283 AD he undertook grand restorations and built an enormous palace, an armory, mint and new shipyards.\n\nThe ruins of Nicomedia are buried beneath the densely populated modern city of Izmit, which has largely obstructed comprehensive excavation. Before the urbanization of the 20th century occurred, select ruins of the Roman-era city could be seen, most prominently sections of the Roman defensive walls which surrounded the city and multiple aqueducts which once supplied Nicomedia's water. Other monuments include the foundations of a 2nd-century AD marble nymphaeum on Istanbul street, a large cistern in the city's Jewish cemetery, and parts of the harbor wall.\n\nThe 1999 İzmit earthquake, which seriously damaged most of the city, also led to major discoveries of ancient Nicomedia during the subsequent debris clearing. A wealth of ancient statuary was uncovered, including statues of Hercules, Athena, Diocletian and Constantine.\n\nIn the years after the earthquake, the Izmit Provincial Cultural Directorate appropriated small areas for excavation, including the site identified as Diocletian's Palace and a nearby Roman theatre. In April 2016 a more extensive excavation of the palace was begun under the supervision of the Kocaeli Museum, which estimated that the site covers 60,000 square meters (196,850 square feet).\n\n"}

{"id": "4370022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4370022", "title": "Pembroke's Men", "text": "Pembroke's Men\n\nThe Earl of Pembroke's Men was an Elizabethan era playing company, or troupe of actors, in English Renaissance theatre. They functioned under the patronage of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. Early and equivocal mentions of a Pembroke's company reach as far back as 1575; but the company is known for certain to have been in existence in 1592. In that year, a share in the company was valued at £80 (more than William Shakespeare would pay for New Place in Stratford-upon-Avon five years later).\n\nSome think that Shakespeare spent time as both an actor and writer for Pembroke's Men in the early 1590s. Two of the earliest quarto publications of individual Shakespearean plays are both linked to this company: the title page of the earliest text of \"Henry VI, Part 3\" (1595) states that the play was performed by Pembroke's Men, while the title page of Q1 of \"Titus Andronicus\" (1594) states that that play was acted by three companies, Pembroke's Men, Derby's Men, and Sussex's Men. The mention of three acting companies for one play is unusual; but the early 1590s were difficult years for the professional actors of the day. Severe epidemics of bubonic plague forced a halt to public performances in and around London; the actors' troupes toured the provinces, splintered and recombined, and generally did whatever was necessary to continue.\n\nThe company that toured under Pembroke's patronage in 1592 is generally considered to have been formed by personnel from Lord Strange's Men and the Lord Admiral's Men, two companies that had been working together at Philip Henslowe's Rose Theatre in 1591. The tour lasted about ten months and was a financial failure. Their tour of 1593 featured \"3 Henry VI;\" other plays in their repertory at the time were Christopher Marlowe's \"Edward II\", and \"The Taming of a Shrew\" (a different version of the Shakespeare play known today). The 1593 tour was also a disappointment; a letter that Henslowe wrote to Edward Alleyn in September 1593 states that Pembroke's Men had been home from their tour for five of six weeks, and had had to pawn their costumes. The company's members struggled through, however; they were touring the provinces again in 1595 and 1596.\n\nPembroke's Men achieved their one great peak of fame, notoriety, infamy in 1597. In February of that year they signed an exclusive contract with Francis Langley, to perform at his new Swan Theatre. Their standing roster was augmented by two actors from the Admiral's Men, Thomas Downton and Richard Jones. Their season began in the spring and early summer without incident, as far as is known; but in July 1597 they performed \"The Isle of Dogs\", by Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson. Something in this lost play (no copy survived its suppression) offended the Privy Council; in response to its \"very seditious and scandalous matter,\" the Council ordered all the public theatres closed for the rest of the summer. Ben Jonson and two of the actors in the cast, Robert Shaw and Gabriel Spencer, were thrown into the Marshalsea prison till October 3; Thomas Nashe escaped only by fleeing to Great Yarmouth in Norfolk (not, as this is often confused, Yarmouth, which is on the Isle of Wight). The documents relating to the case specify that Jonson was not only a part-author of the play, but also a member of the cast — one of the few indications of Jonson's early career on the boards.\n\nThe other theatre companies in London were allowed to resume activity after the summer was over; but the Privy Council decided to punish Langley in particular (he was in trouble for additional, non-theatre-related causes), and kept the Swan closed. (Langley may have staged occasional performances despite the ban; but he was unable to resume regular performances, which would have provided a regular income for all concerned.) This presented the Pembroke's Men with a critical problem: they were legally bound to act only for Langley — but couldn't act for Langley. The company broke apart under the strain: Jones and Downton returned to the Admiral's, and three more Pembroke men, William Borne and the recently released Shaw and Spencer, followed them. (Spencer would be killed by Jonson in their famous duel a year later.) They appear to have taken some Pembroke's playscripts with them, titles that may have included a \"Dido and Aeneas\", plus \"Hardicanute, Black Joan, Friar Spendleton, Alice Pierce,\" and others.\n\nLangley sued over this breach of contract; but apparently he reached some kind of agreement with Henslowe, since the five actors stayed with Henslowe's company. The rump of Pembroke's Men, perhaps augmented with replacement recruits, toured the provinces from late 1597 through 1599. After two unsuccessful performances at the Rose Theatre in October 1600, the company disappears from history; some of its members may have joined Worcester's Men, a company that was re-forming at the time. Langley himself died a year after the company, in 1601.\n"}
{"id": "1294202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1294202", "title": "Philippe de Chérisey", "text": "Philippe de Chérisey\n\nPhilippe Louis Henri Marie de Chérisey, 9th marquess de Chérisey (13 February 1923 – 17 July 1985) was a French writer, radio humorist, surrealist and supporting actor (using the stage name Amédée).\n\nHe is best known for his creation of fake parchments published in the 1967 book \"L'Or de Rennes\" by Gérard de Sède, as part of his involvement in the Priory of Sion hoax between 1962-1983.\n\nComing from a wealthy family in the Lorraine, de Chérisey decided to become an actor against his family's wishes. He enrolled in the René Simon drama school in 1946 where he started his actor's training, and his most notable film appearance was in \"Jeux interdits\" in 1952. He was known as a bon viveur, regularly enjoyed wine and frequented public libraries where his natural curiosity made him follow up anything that took his fancy.\n\nPhilippe de Chérisey was a follower of the surrealist movement, who claimed acquaintance with Eugene Ionesco and was like him a member of the College of Pataphysics, although - like his membership of Oulipo - there is no evidence that he was actively involved. His desire to subvert the norms of culture, or in other words, create an alternate reality that became more real than reality itself, was done within the context of the Priory of Sion and to promote the claim that Pierre Plantard was the direct descendant of Dagobert II. He considered himself a satirist from his days in French radio, and continued this persona within the theme of the Priory of Sion calling himself a prankster. The best known example of this is his esoteric novella \"Circuit\" (originally written in 1968, but not actually deposited within the Bibliothèque nationale de France until 1971).\n\nBy the early 1960s Philippe de Chérisey met Pierre Plantard, and together they developed an interest in Rennes-le-Château. From the mid-1950s local hotelier Noël Corbu circulated a story to boost trade, that the 19th century priest Bérenger Saunière of Rennes-le-Château had discovered the treasure of Blanche of Castile. The author Robert Charroux published Corbu's story in his 1962 book \"Trésors du Monde\". In a letter dated 2 April 1965 to his girlfriend, de Chérisey wrote: \"Don't tell anyone, but I'll be setting out again for four days in the Pyrenees with Plantard to see if we can get any closer to Mary Magdalene.\" A mixture of de Chérisey's humor and surrealism can be identified within his activities relating to the Priory of Sion hoax, Gisors and Rennes-le-Château, contained in his correspondence as well as in his documents that he deposited in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, de Chérisey forged two parchments, photocopies of which appeared in the 1967 book \"L'Or de Rennes\" by Gérard de Sède. De Sède's book adapted Corbu's story to fit-in with Plantard's claims about the Priory of Sion. The parchments hinted at the survival of the line of the Frankish king Dagobert II, that Plantard claimed to be descended from, as well as attempting to verify the existence of the 1000-year-old secret society, the Priory of Sion. The two \"parchments\" were later used as source material for the 1982 book \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\", which was itself used as a primary source for the 2003 bestselling novel \"The Da Vinci Code\". Other documents, containing fake genealogies, were planted in the French National Library, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.\n\nPierre Plantard and Gérard de Sède fell out over book royalties when \"L'Or de Rennes\" was published in 1967, at the same time Philippe de Chérisey announced that he had forged the \"parchments\". De Chérisey elaborated about this in his 1978 unpublished document \"L'Énigme de Rennes\", claiming they were originally made for his friend Francis Blanche, as material for a French radio serial entitled \"Signé Furax\". A second document by de Chérisey entitled \"Pierre et papier\" (\"Stone and Paper\") provides a more detailed explanation, giving the more complicated decoding technique to one of the \"parchments\" by using a Knight's Tour 25-letter alphabet, omitting the letter \"w\", the knowledge of which can only be known to the forger. An English translation of this document, together with a reproduction of the original, was published by Jean-Luc Chaumeil in 2010.\n\nThe text of one \"parchment\" (parchment 1) was copied from \"Codex Bezae\", an Old Latin/Greek diglot from the 5th century CE contained in the book by Fulcran Grégoire Vigouroux, \"Dictionnaire De La Bible\" (1895). Philippe de Chérisey's reason for copying the passage from the Codex Bezae was his interest in the phrase \"In Sabbato Secundo Primo\", also found in the Gospel of Luke 6:1. Philippe de Chérisey stated: \"This phrase has given headaches to the anonymous (secret) societies. It has to be said that 'A day of Sabbath, second first' is not really translatable. No one has ever heard of that. So, as the disciples walk through a cornfield and, being hungry, eat the corn, there and then, it must mean 'Second Sabbath following the first day of the shewbread.' This is the only interpretation we could find.\" De Chérisey went on to provide his own interpretation: \"In Sabbato Secundo Primo does not mean 'A day of Sabbath, second first' but rather 'As second in command, Sabassius became first.' What is interesting is that the witches' meetings are called 'Sabbaths', not because of the Jewish celebrations, but because of Sabassius, god of the Phrygians\".\n\nThis \"parchment\" also contained an encrypted message written in modern French: \"À Dagobert II Roi et à Sion est ce trésor et il est là mort.\" (translated as \"To King Dagobert II and to Sion does this treasure belong, and he is there, dead\").\n\nDe Chérisey also chose to copy material from Vigouroux because he was a priest connected with the Church of St Sulpice, a location that had been exploited as part of the Priory of Sion myths as created by Plantard and de Chérisey, so de Chérisey's utilisation of this priest fitted in nicely into these myths.\n\nAccording to an investigation into the Priory of Sion hoax by the American news program 60 Minutes, the other document (parchment 2) was copied from a 19th-century version of the Latin Vulgate published by John Wordsworth and Henry J. White \"Novum Testamentum Domini Nostri Iesu Christi latine secundum sancti Hieronymi\" (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1889–1954), and the original forged \"parchments\" are now in the possession of Jean-Luc Chaumeil, a French writer, who states that he had their age analyzed, and it was confirmed that they were merely decades old, not centuries. Chaumeil also has letters by de Chérisey, which contain proof that De Chérisey was knowingly engaging in a fraud.\n\nThat Philippe de Chérisey was not a specialist of Latin paleography and had even a bit lost his Latin knowledge (got from high school) is demonstrated in his copying of the Latin Text from the Codex Bezae for one of his \"parchments\": for instance, he made several of the most basic errors in copying the Latin uncials, which therefore garbles the spelling of multiple words. This information is frequently omitted by those who present the \"parchments\" as being authentic.\n\nIn an interview during the 1970s with author Jean-Luc Chaumeil, Philippe de Chérisey asserted: \"the parchments of the Gospel according to Saint Luke fabricated by me and for which I pinched the uncial text from the work \"L'archéologie chrétienne\" (\"Christian Archaeology\") by Dom Cabrol at the National Library, section C25\".\n\nPhilippe de Chérisey asserted in a letter dated 29 January 1974 to French author Pierre Jarnac: \"P.S. Do you know that the famous manuscripts supposedly discovered by the Abbé Saunière were composed in 1965? And that I took responsibility for being the author?\"\n\nAccording to Henry Lincoln, one of the co-authors of \"Holy Blood Holy Grail\", Plantard admitted to him in person that the various documents had been forged, and identified de Chérisey as their creator.\n\nA schism developed between Pierre Plantard and Philippe de Chérisey in 1983, when de Chérisey began collaborating with Paul Rouelle (his dentist) on a book which would have incorporated the Priory of Sion concepts.\n\nFrench author Pierre Jarnac reproduced part of a letter he received dated 22 May 1985 from Pierre Plantard: \"You need to know only that I have no involvement whatsoever with the 'deathless prose' of Monsieur Philippe de Chérisey, who was the co-author with Monsieur Paul Rouelle of the book COURT-CIRCUIT, lodged with the BN in December 1984 or January 1985, which dragged my name through the mud. The Marquis de Chérisey was a good friend of mine from university days, but I very often disapprove of his books which are really quite bizarre.\"\n\nPhilippe de Chérisey died in Paris on 17 July 1985, while working to finish an encyclopedia of trema. His funeral was held at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Paris and he was buried in the family vault at Rœux (Pas-de-Calais).\n\nHis death was announced by Gino Sandri in number 10 of \"Etudes Mérovingiennes\" (August 1985), the journal of the association \"Cercle Saint Dagobert II\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52964974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52964974", "title": "Rajlich's hypothesis", "text": "Rajlich's hypothesis\n\nRajlich's hypothesis is a physical hypothesis with a significance for geology. There exist macroscopic white lamellae inside quartz and other minerals in the Bohemian Massif and even at another places in whole of the world like wavefronts generated by a meteorite impact according to the hypothesis. The hypothetical wavefronts are composed of many microcavities. Their origin is seen in a physical phenomenon of ultrasonic cavitation, which is well known from the technical practice.\n\nThe cavities are usually made inside liquids, not in solid state media. The meteorite hit should fluidize the minerals, and mechanical waves of high frequency should tear them.\n\nBased on the technical practice it is known that a cavity implosion inside liquid generates high temperatures of thousands of kelvins and even a shock wave. There are found many intersecting systems of white lamellae inside quartz at many localities from the Bohemian Massif. It can be assumed that according to high number of wavefronts transferred through the minerals and resulting high number of cavity implosions, the structure of quartz was partially disrupted during the fluidization and the distribution of prevailing pressure was respected during the transfer into a solid state. There could be then preferred a creation of denser quartz in the area of higher pressure. This means a creation of smaller basic molecular Si-O rings. The situation in the area of lower pressure could be opposite. A finding of such harmonic signature of the quartz density is considered to be an option for the hypothesis verification.\n\nThe author of the hypothesis is a Czech geologist Petr Rajlich. It is connected with the Czech Crater hypothesis.\n\nThe shapes of the microcavities are between spheres and negative crystals.\n\nThere is seen a probable erasure of older sets of lamellae by new sets in quartz with hypothetical cavitation lamellae, which is presented by Rajlich in few samples. A similar distribution is common in quartz with conventional PDF lamellae. Their presence is a today's recognized criterion for a verification of impact structures.\n\nThe cavitation lamellae sometimes seem like small teeth or pillars, which is a well known effect from today's verified impact structures. The teeth become visible after acid etching. The effect is called pillaring.\n\nThe minerals are not always cut by lot of lamellae, but are absolutely torn up or cut like slices. This is observable for example in the case of tourmalines from Czech pegmatites.\n\nThe spacing of cavitation lamellae can be from millimeters up to meters. A consolidation into compact blocks by fluidization of more smaller grains is suggested in the case of large quartz cores from pegmatites.\n\nUltrasonic cleaning effects that are well known from the technical practice are also discussed. Quartz between lamellae is very clear and thus contains almost no fluid inclusions. There exists an assumption that they collapsed due to many mechanical pulses.\n\nThere is found a grooving pattern on some samples of quartz. It looks like surface waves.\n\nMany rose quartz samples from the whole of the world contain systems of white lamellae. A causal relationship between the shock metamorphism and the origin of rose color could define the rose quartz as a shocked mineral. A similar relationship could be true also in the case of other quartz varieties.\n\nMechanical or electromagnetic waves move without mutual influencing. The cavitation lamellae intersect each other without visible mutual influencing, for example without mutual movements, as well. It is typical for various types of fractures and deformation lamellae that are connected with quartz undulose extinction.\n\nRock fluidization due to a meteorite hit was already theorized and experimentally tested by H. J. Melosh and E. S. Gaffney in the 1980s.\n\nIf we estimate the wavelength from the spacing of hypothetical cavitation lamellae, we get values that are equal to fractions of meters. We then obtain the frequencies in the order of min. 10 Hz from the assumption that the waves going through rocks were of higher speed than the speed of the meteorite just before the hit (tens of thousands meters per second). The initial pressure impuls should even generate the waves of frequencies in the order of 10 Hz according to the hypothesis. This equals to typical frequencies of molecular vibrations. Such waves could be responsible for a short liquid behavior of quartz and other minerals.\n\nThe white lamellae frequently segue into shapes of wispy trails. Real experiments in liquids showed that such structures arise after a collapse of traveling bubble cavitation.\n\nThe white lamellae are conventionally explained by two other ways. They can be zonal growths or tensile fractures that could be reactivated (healed) in many ways. The first option is less probable, because the lamellae intersect each other. The zonal growths respect the crystallographic planes. The second option is much more probable. Variations of tensile fractures can be found for example in ice. An example can be the Jupiter's moon Europa that has a surface, which is cut by a dense net of fractures. However the tensile fractures and various ruptures have in comparison to hypothetical cavitation lamellae usually not a straight shape, they are radially distributed, cracked or one fracture is linked to another fracture in its certain part.\n"}

Court dances required the dancers to be trained and were often for display and entertainment, whereas country dances could be attempted by anyone. At Court, the formal entertainment would often be followed by many hours of country dances which all present could join in. Dances described as country dances such as Chiarantana or Chiaranzana remained popular over a long period - over two centuries in the case of this dance. A Renaissance dance can be likened to a ball.\n\nKnowledge of court dances has survived better than that of country dances as they were collected by dancing masters in manuscripts and later in printed books. The earliest surviving manuscripts that provide detailed dance instructions are from 15th century Italy. The earliest printed dance manuals come from late 16th century France and Italy. The earliest dance descriptions in England come from the Gresley manuscript 1500 found in the Derbyshire Record Office, D77 B0x 38 pp 51–79. These have been recently published as \"Cherwell Thy Wyne (Show your joy): Dances of fifteenth-century England from the Gresley manuscript\". The first printed English source appeared in 1652, the first edition of Playford.\n\nThe dances in these manuals are extremely varied in nature. They range from slow, stately dances (bassadance, pavane, almain) to fast, lively dances (galliard, coranto, canario). The former, in which the dancers' feet did not leave the ground were styled the \"dance basse\" while energetic dances with leaps and lifts were called the \"haute dance\". Some were choreographed, others were improvised on the spot. One dance for couples, a form of the galliard called lavolta, involved a rather intimate hold between the man and woman, with the woman being lifted into the air while the couple made a turn. Other dances, such as branles or bransles, were danced by many people in a circle or line.\n\nOur knowledge of 15th-century Italian dances comes mainly from the surviving works of three Italian dance masters: Domenico da Piacenza, Antonio Cornazzano and Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro. Their work deals with similar steps and dances, though some evolution can be seen. The main types of dances described are bassa danze and \"balletti\". These are the earliest European dances to be well-documented, as we have a reasonable knowledge of the choreographies, steps and music used.\n\n\n\nMany groups exist that recreate historical music and dance from the Renaissance period \n"}

T. Robinson somewhat paradoxically combines secularism and theology. Recognized in the 1960s, it was influenced both by neo-orthodoxy, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Harvey Cox, and the existentialism of Søren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich. Secular theology digested modern movements like the Death of God Theology propagated by Thomas J. J. Altizer or the philosophical existentialism of Paul Tillich and eased the introduction of such ideas into the theological mainstream and made constructive evaluations, as well as contributions, to them.\n\nJohn Shelby Spong advocates a nuanced approach to scripture (as opposed to blunt Biblical literalism at the other end of the scale), informed by scholarship and compassion, which he argues can be consistent with both Christian tradition and a contemporary understanding of the universe. Secular theology holds that theism has lost credibility as a valid conception of God's nature. It rejects the concept of a personal God and embraces the status of Jesus Christ, Christology and Christian eschatology as Christian mythology without basis in historical events.\n\nThe movement chiefly came about as a response to general dissatisfaction with the Christian establishment's tendency to lapse into \"provincialism\" when presented with the \"unusual\" theological ideas common during the 1960s. The movement also suggested the legitimacy of seeking the holy outside the church itself. Thereby it suggests that the church did not have exclusive rights to divine inspiration. In a sense, this incorporated a strong sense of continuous revelation in which truth of the religious sort was sought out in poetry, music, art, or even the pub and in the street.\n\nCertain other religions besides Christianity have developed secular theologies and applied these to core concepts of their own traditions. Notable among such movements has been the Reconstructionist Judaism of Mordecai Kaplan, which understands God and the universe in a manner concordant with Deweyan naturalism.\n\nIn Hinduism, the Advaita school of theology is generally regarded as non-theistic as it accepts all interpretations of God or Ishvara.\n\n"}

Such is the narrowness of her territory that her knees and chin touch, no other position being possible. Her name in full, Vari-ma-te-takere, Gill translates as \"The very beginning\". The word \"vari\", however, also means \"mud\", and, taken in conjunction with \"takere\" (canoe bottom or keel), the name literally means \"The mud at the bottom\"; suggesting the mud on the bottom of Avaiki. \"Vari\" is the mud of taro swamps and connotes potential plant growth. As applied to a female, it means menstruation and conveys a connection with the female womb and the origin of human growth. The following passage from a dramatic song of creation (circa 1790) mentions Vari:\n\n\"But we have no father whatever:<br> Vari alone made us.<br> That home of Vari is <br> The very narrowest of all! <br> Vari's home is in the narrowest of spaces, <br> A goddess feeding on raw taro<br> At appointed periods of worship!<br> Thy mother, Vatea, is self-existent.\"\n\nVari was very anxious for progeny.

{"id": "33538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33538", "title": "Week", "text": "Week\n\nA week is a time unit equal to seven days. It is the standard time period used for cycles of rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside—although not strictly part of—the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe days of the week were named after the classical planets (derived from the astrological system of planetary hours) in the Roman era. In English, the names are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday .\n\nISO 8601 includes the ISO week date system, a numbering system for weeks within a given year – each week begins on a Monday and is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday–Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that). ISO 8601 assigns numbers to the days of the week, running from 1 to 7 for Monday through to Sunday.\nThe term \"week\" is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days, such as the nundinal cycle of the ancient Roman calendar, the \"work week\", or \"school week\" referring only to the days spent on those activities.\n\nThe English word \"week\" comes from the Old English \"wice\", ultimately from a Common Germanic ', from a root ' \"turn, move, change\". The Germanic word probably had a wider meaning prior to the adoption of the Roman calendar, perhaps \"succession series\", as suggested by Gothic \"wikō\" translating \"taxis\" \"order\" in Luke 1:8.\n\nThe seven-day week is named in many languages by a word derived from \"seven\". The archaism sennight (\"seven-night\") preserves the old Germanic practice of reckoning time by nights, as in the more common \"fortnight\" (\"fourteen-night\"). Hebdomad and hebdomadal week both derive from the Greek \"hebdomás\" (, \"a seven\"). The obsolete septimane is cognate with the Romance terms derived from Latin \"septimana\" (\"a seven\").\n\nSlavic has a formation \"*tъ(žь)dьnь\" (Serbian тједан, Croatian tjedan, Ukrainian тиждень, Czech \"týden\", Polish \"tydzień\"), from \"*tъ\" \"this\" + \"*dьnь\" \"day\". Chinese has 星期, as it were \"planetary time unit\".\n\nA week is defined as an interval of exactly seven days, so that technically, except at daylight saving time transitions or leap seconds,\nWith respect to the Gregorian calendar:\n\nIn a Gregorian mean year, there are 365.2425 days, and thus exactly or 52.1775 weeks (unlike the Julian year of 365.25 days or ≈ 52.1786 weeks, which cannot be represented by a finite decimal expansion). There are exactly 20,871 weeks in 400 Gregorian years, so 03 1618 was a just as was 03 2018.\n\nRelative to the path of the Moon, a week is 23.659% of an average lunation or 94.637% of an average quarter lunation.\n\nHistorically, the system of Dominical letters (letters A to G identifying the weekday of the first day of a given year) has been used to facilitate calculation of the day of week.\nThe day of the week can be easily calculated given a date's Julian day number (JD, i.e. the integer value at noon UT): \nAdding one to the remainder after dividing the Julian day number by seven (JD \"modulo\" 7 + 1) yields that date's ISO 8601 day of the week (for example, the Julian day number of 03 2018 is 0. Calculating (0 mod 7 + 1) yields 1, corresponding to .).\n\nThe days of the week were originally named for the classical planets. This naming system persisted alongside an \"ecclesiastical\" tradition of numbering the days, in ecclesiastical Latin beginning with \"dominica\" (the Day of the Lord) as the first day. The Greco-Roman gods associated with the classical planets were rendered in their \"interpretatio germanica\" at some point during the late Roman Empire, yielding the Germanic tradition of names based on indigenous deities.\n\nThe ordering of the weekday names is not the classical order of the planets (by distance in the planetary spheres model, nor, equivalently, by their apparent speed of movement in the night sky). Instead, the planetary hours systems resulted in succeeding days being named for planets that are three places apart in their traditional listing. This characteristic was apparently discussed in Plutarch in a treatise written in c. AD 100, which is reported to have addressed the question of \"Why are the days named after the planets reckoned in a different order from the actual order?\" (the text of Plutarch's treatise has been lost).\n\nAn ecclesiastical, non-astrological, system of numbering the days of the week was adopted in Late Antiquity. This model also seems to have influenced (presumably via Gothic) the designation of Wednesday as \"mid-week\" in Old High German (\"mittawehha\") and Old Church Slavonic (срѣда). Old Church Slavonic may have also modeled the name of Monday, понєдѣльникъ, after the Latin \"feria secunda\". The ecclesiastical system became prevalent in Eastern Christianity, but in the Latin West it remains extant only in modern Icelandic, Galician and Portuguese.\n\nA continuous seven-day cycle that runs throughout history paying no attention whatsoever to the phases of the moon was probably first practiced in Judaism, dated to the 6th century BC at the latest.\n\nThere are several hypotheses concerning the origin of the biblical seven-day cycle.\n\nFriedrich Delitzsch and others suggested that the seven-day week being approximately a quarter of a lunation is the implicit astronomical origin of the seven-day week, and indeed the Babylonian calendar used intercalary days to synchronize the last week of a month with the new moon. According to this theory, the Jewish week was adopted from the Babylonians while removing the moon-dependency.\n\nHowever, Niels-Erik Andreasen, Jeffrey H. Tigay and others claimed that the sabbath is mentioned as a day of rest in some of the earliest layers of the Pentateuch dated to the 9th century BC at the latest, centuries before Judea's Babylonian exile. They also find the resemblance between the biblical Sabbath and the Babylonian system to be weak. Therefore, they suggested that the seven-day week may reflect an independent Israelite tradition. Tigay writes:\n\nIt is clear that among neighboring nations that were in position to have an influence over Israel – and in fact which did influence it in various matters – there is no precise parallel to the Israelite Sabbatical week. This leads to the conclusion that the Sabbatical week, which is as unique to Israel as the Sabbath from which it flows, is an independent Israelite creation.\n\nThe seven-day week seems to have been adopted, at different stages, by the Persian Empire, in Hellenistic astrology, and (via Greek transmission) in Gupta India and Tang China.\nThe Babylonian system was received by the Greeks in the 4th century BC (notably via Eudoxus of Cnidus). However the designation of the seven days of the week to the seven planets is an innovation introduced in the time of Augustus. The astrological concept of planetary hours is rather an original innovation of Hellenistic astrology, probably first conceived in the 2nd century BC.\n\nThe seven day week was widely known throughout the Roman Empire by the 1st century AD, along with references to the Jewish Sabbath by Roman scholars such as Seneca and Ovid. The seven day cycle ultimately replaced the older Roman system of the nundinal cycle, probably during the 4th century.\n\nThe earliest evidence of an astrological significance of a seven-day period is connected to Gudea, priest-king of Lagash in Sumer during the Gutian dynasty, who built a seven-room temple, which he dedicated with a seven-day festival. In the flood story of the Assyro-Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh the storm lasts for seven days, the dove is sent out after seven days, and the Noah-like character of Utnapishtim leaves the ark seven days after it reaches firm ground.\n\nIt seems likely that the Hebrew seven-day week is based on the Babylonian tradition, although going through certain adaptations. George Aaron Barton speculated that the seven-day creation account of Genesis is connected to the Babylonian creation epic, Enûma Eliš, which is recorded on seven tablets.\n\nCounting from the new moon, the Babylonians celebrated the 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th as \"holy-days\", also called \"evil days\" (meaning \"unsuitable\" for prohibited activities). On these days, officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to \"make a wish\", and at least the 28th was known as a \"rest-day\".\nOn each of them, offerings were made to a different god and goddess.\n\nIn a frequently-quoted suggestion going back to the early 20th century, the Hebrew \"Sabbath\" is compared to the Sumerian \"sa-bat\" \"mid-rest\", a term for the full moon. The Sumerian term has been reconstructed as rendered \"Sapattu\" or \"Sabattu\" in Babylonian, possibly present in the lost fifth tablet of the Enûma Eliš, tentatively reconstructed \"[Sa]bbath shalt thou then encounter, mid[month]ly\".\n\nThe Zoroastrian calendar follows the Babylonian in relating the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th of the month to Ahura Mazda.\nThe forerunner of all modern Zoroastrian calendars is the system used to determine dates in the Persian Empire, adopted from the Babylonian calendar by the 4th century BC.\n\nFrank C. Senn in his book \"Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical\" points to data suggesting evidence of an early continuous use of a seven-day week; referring to the Jews during the Babylonian Captivity in the 6th century BC, after the destruction of the Temple of Solomon.\nWhile the seven-day week in Judaism is tied to Creation account in the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible (where God creates the heavens and the earth in six days and rests on the seventh; , in the Book of Exodus, the fourth of the Ten Commandments is to rest on the seventh day, \"Shabbat\", which can be seen as implying a socially instituted seven-day week), it is not clear whether the Genesis narrative predates the Babylonian Captivity of the Jews in the 6th century BC. At least since the Second Temple period under Persian rule, Judaism relied on the seven-day cycle of recurring Sabbaths.\n\nTablets from the Achaemenid period indicate that the lunation of 29 or 30 days basically contained three seven-day weeks, and a final week of eight or nine days inclusive, breaking the continuous seven-day cycle.\nThe Babylonians additionally celebrated the 19th as a special \"evil day\", the \"day of anger\", because it was roughly the 49th day of the (preceding) month, completing a \"week of weeks\", also with sacrifices and prohibitions.\n\nDifficulties with Friedrich Delitzsch's origin theory connecting Hebrew \"Shabbat\" with the Babylonian lunar cycle include reconciling the differences between an unbroken week and a lunar week, and explaining the absence of texts naming the lunar week as \"Shabbat\" in any language.\n\nIn Jewish sources by the time of the Septuagint, the term \"Sabbath\" (Greek \"Sabbaton\") by synecdoche also came to refer to an entire seven-day week, the interval between two weekly Sabbaths.\nJesus's parable of the Pharisee and the Publican (Luke 18:12) describes the Pharisee as fasting \"twice in the week\" (Greek δὶς τοῦ σαββάτου \"dis tou sabbatou\").\n\nThe ancient Romans traditionally used the eight-day nundinum but, after the Julian calendar had come into effect in 45 BC, the seven-day week came into increasing use. For a while, the week and the nundinal cycle coexisted, but by the time the week was officially adopted by Constantine in AD 321, the nundinal cycle had fallen out of use. The association of the days of the week with the Sun, the Moon and the five planets visible to the naked eye dates to the Roman era (2nd century).\n\nThe continuous seven-day cycle of the days of the week can be traced back to the reign of Augustus; the first identifiable date cited complete with day of the week is 6 February AD 60, identified as a \"Sunday\" (as \"viii idus Februarius dies solis\" \"eighth day before the ides of February, day of the Sun\") in a Pompeiian graffito. According to the (contemporary) Julian calendar, 6 February 60 was, however, a Wednesday. This is explained by the existence of two conventions of naming days of the weeks based on the planetary hours system: 6 February was a \"Sunday\" based on the sunset naming convention, and a \"Wednesday\" based on the sunrise naming convention.\n\nThe earliest known reference in Chinese writings to a seven-day week is attributed to Fan Ning, who lived in the late 4th century in the Jin Dynasty, while diffusions from the Manichaeans are documented with the writings of the Chinese Buddhist monk Yi Jing and the Ceylonese or Central Asian Buddhist monk Bu Kong of the 7th century (Tang Dynasty).\n\nThe Chinese variant of the planetary system was brought to Japan by the Japanese monk Kobo Daishi (9th century). Surviving diaries of the Japanese statesman Fujiwara Michinaga show the seven-day system in use in Heian Japan as early as 1007. In Japan, the seven-day system was kept in use for astrological purposes until its promotion to a full-fledged Western-style calendrical basis during the Meiji era.\n\nThe seven-day week was known in India by the 6th century, referenced in the Pañcasiddhāntikā. Shashi (2000) mentions the Garga Samhita, which he places in the 1st century BC or AD, as a possible earlier reference to a seven-day week in India. He concludes \"the above references furnish a terminus ad quem (viz. 1st century) The terminus a quo cannot be stated with certainty\".\n\nIn Arabia, a similar seven-week system was adopted, that may be influenced by the Hebrew week (via Christianity).\n\nThe seven-day weekly cycle has remained unbroken in Christendom, and hence in Western history, for almost two millennia, despite changes to the Coptic, Julian, and Gregorian calendars, demonstrated by the date of Easter Sunday having been traced back through numerous computistic tables to an Ethiopic copy of an early Alexandrian table beginning with the Easter of AD 311.\n\nA tradition of divinations arranged for the days of the week on which certain feast days occur develops in the Early Medieval period. There are many later variants of this, including the German \"Bauern-Praktik\" and the versions of \"Erra Pater\" published in 16th to 17th century England, mocked in Samuel Butler's \"Hudibras\". South and East Slavic versions are known as \"koliadniki\" (from \"koliada\", a loan of Latin \"calendae\"), with Bulgarian copies dating from the 13th century, and Serbian versions from the 14th century.\nMedieval Christian traditions associated with the lucky or unlucky nature of certain days of the week survived into the modern period. This concerns primarily Friday, associated with the crucifixion of Jesus. Sunday, sometimes personified as Saint Anastasia, was itself an object of worship in Russia, a practice denounced in a sermon extant in copies going back to the 14th century.\n\nSunday, in the ecclesiastical numbering system also counted as the \"feria prima\" or the first day of the week; yet, at the same time, figures as the \"eighth day\", and has occasionally been so called in Christian liturgy.\nJustin Martyr wrote: \"the first day after the Sabbath, remaining the first of all the days, is called, however, the eighth, according to the number of all the days of the cycle, and [yet] remains the first\".\n\nA period of eight days, starting and ending on a Sunday, is called an octave, particularly in Roman Catholic liturgy. In German, the phrase \"in acht Tagen\" (literally \"in eight days\") means one week from today. In Italian, the phrase (\"oggi otto\" (literally \"today eight\") also means one week from today.\n\nWeeks in a Gregorian calendar year can be numbered for each year. This style of numbering is commonly used (for example, by schools and businesses) in some European and Asian countries, but rare elsewhere.\n\nISO 8601 includes the ISO week date system, a numbering system for weeks – each week begins on a Monday and is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday–Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that). For example, week 1 of 2004 (2004W01) ran from Monday, 29 December 2003 to Sunday, 4 January 2004, because its Thursday was 1 January 2004, whereas week 1 of 2005 (2005W01) ran from Monday, 3 January 2005 to Sunday, 9 January 2005, because its Thursday was 6 January 2005 and so the first Thursday of 2005. The highest week number in a year is either 52 or 53 (it was 53 in the year 2004). Schematically, this ISO convention translates as follows:\n\nIn some countries, though, the numbering system is different from the ISO standard. At least six numberings are in use: \n\nThe semiconductor package date code\nis often a 4 digit date code YYWW where the first two digits YY are the last 2 digits of the calendar year and the last two digits WW are the two-digit week number.\n\nThe tire date code mandated by the US DOT\nis a 4 digit date code WWYY with two digits of the week number WW followed by the last two digits of the calendar year YY.\n\nThe term \"week\" is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days. Such \"weeks\" of between four and ten days have been used historically in various places. Intervals longer than 10 days are not usually termed \"weeks\" as they are closer in length to the fortnight or the month than to the seven-day week.\n\nCalendars unrelated to the Chaldean, Hellenistic, Christian or Jewish traditions often have time cycles between the day and the month of varying lengths, sometimes also called \"weeks\".\n\nAn eight-day week was used in Ancient Rome and possibly in the pre-Christian Celtic calendar. Traces of a nine-day week are found in Baltic languages and in Welsh. The ancient Chinese calendar had a ten-day week, as did the ancient Egyptian calendar (and, incidentally, the French Republican Calendar, dividing its 30-day months into thirds).\n\nA six-day week is found in the Akan Calendar. Several cultures used a five-day week, including the 10th century Icelandic calendar, the Javanese calendar, and the traditional cycle of market days in Korea. The Igbo have a \"market week\" of four days. Evidence of a \"three-day week\" has been derived from the names of the days of the week in Guipuscoan Basque.\n\nThe Aztecs and Mayas used the Mesoamerican calendars. The most important of these calendars divided a ritual cycle of 260 days (known as \"Tonalpohualli\" in Nahuatl and \"Tzolk'in\" in Yucatec Maya) into 20 weeks of 13 days (known in Spanish as trecenas). They also divided the solar year into 18 periods of 20 days and five nameless days, creating a 20-day month divided into four five-day weeks. The end of each five-day week was a market day.\n\nThe Balinese Pawukon is a 210-day calendar consisting of 10 different simultaneously running weeks of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 days, of which the weeks of 4, 8 and 9 days are interrupted to fit into the 210-day cycle.\n\nA 10-day week, called \"décade\", was used in France for nine and a half years from October 1793 to April 1802; furthermore, the Paris Commune adopted the Revolutionary Calendar for 18 days in 1871.\n\nThe Bahá'í calendar features a 19-day period which some classify as a month and others classify as a week.\n\nThe International Fixed Calendar (also known as the \"Eastman plan\") fixed every date always on the same weekday. This plan kept a 7-day week while defining a year of 13 months with 28 days each. It was the official calendar of the Eastman Kodak Company for decades.\nIn the Soviet Union between 1929 and 1940, most factory and enterprise workers, but not collective farm workers, used five- and six-day work weeks while the entire country continued to use the traditional seven-day week. From 1929 to 1951, five national holidays were days of rest (, , ). From autumn 1929 to summer 1931, the remaining 360 days of the year were subdivided into 72 five-day work weeks beginning on . Workers were assigned any one of the five days as their day off, even if their spouse or friends might be assigned a different day off. Peak usage of the five-day work week occurred on at 72% of industrial workers. From summer 1931 until , each Gregorian month was subdivided into five six-day work weeks, more-or-less, beginning with the first day of each month. The sixth day of each six-day work week was a uniform day of rest. On 74.2% of industrial workers were on non-continuous schedules, mostly six-day work weeks, while 25.8% were still on continuous schedules, mostly five-day work weeks. The Gregorian calendar with its irregular month lengths and the traditional seven-day week were used in the Soviet Union during its entire existence, including 1929–1940; for example, in the masthead of Pravda, the official Communist newspaper, and in both Soviet calendars displayed here. The traditional names of the seven-day week continued to be used, including \"Resurrection\" (Воскресенье) for Sunday and \"Sabbath\" (Суббота) for Saturday, despite the government's officially atheistic policy.\n\n"}
{"id": "296311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296311", "title": "Whig history", "text": "Whig history\n\nWhig history (or Whig historiography) is an approach to historiography that presents the past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater liberty and enlightenment, culminating in modern forms of liberal democracy and constitutional monarchy.\n\nIn general, Whig historians emphasize the rise of constitutional government, personal freedoms and scientific progress. The term is often applied generally (and pejoratively) to histories that present the past as the inexorable march of progress towards enlightenment. The term is also used extensively in the history of science to mean historiography that focuses on the successful chain of theories and experiments that led to present-day science, while ignoring failed theories and dead ends.\n\nWhig history is a form of liberalism, putting its faith in the power of human reason to reshape society for the better, regardless of past history and tradition. It proposes the inevitable progress of humankind.\n\nThe British historian Herbert Butterfield coined the term \"Whig history\" in his short but influential book \"The Whig Interpretation of History\" (1931). It takes its name from the British Whigs, advocates of the power of Parliament, who opposed the Tories, advocates of the power of the king.\n\nThe term has been applied widely in historical disciplines outside of British history (the history of science, for example) to criticize any teleological (or goal-directed), hero-based and transhistorical narrative: in a non-British, more general context, 'whig history' (lower-case) is preferred. The abstract noun \"whiggishness\" is sometimes used as a generic term for Whig historiography.\n\nWhig history has no direct relation to either the British Whig or American Whig parties and should not be confused with \"Whiggism\", which is a political ideology. The term \"Whiggery\" is ambiguous in contemporary usage: it may either mean party politics and ideology, or a general intellectual approach.\n\nWhen H. A. L. Fisher in 1928 gave a Raleigh lecture on \"The Whig Historians, from Sir James Mackintosh to Sir George Trevelyan\", he implied that \"Whig historian\" was adequately taken as a political rather than a progressive or teleological label and this put the concept into play. P. B. M. Blaas, author of the book \"Continuity and Anachronism\", has argued that Whig history itself had lost all vitality by 1914.\n\nButterfield's book on the Whig interpretation marked the emergence of a negative concept in historiography under a convenient phrase, but was not isolated. Undermining whiggish narratives was one aspect of the post–World War I re-evaluation of European history in general and Butterfield's critique exemplified this trend. Intellectuals no longer believed the world was automatically getting better and better. Subsequent generations of academic historians have similarly rejected Whig history because of its presentist and teleological assumption that history is driving toward some sort of goal. According to Victor Feske, there is too much readiness to accept Butterfield's classic formulation from 1931 as definitive. A study by Keith Sewell, \"Herbert Butterfield and the Interpretation of History\", was published in 2005.\n\nThe characteristics of Whig history as defined by Butterfield include interpreting history as a story of progress toward the present and specifically toward the British constitutional settlement. Butterfield wrote:\n\nTypical distortions thereby introduced are:\n\nButterfield argued that this approach to history compromised the work of the historian in several ways. The emphasis on the inevitability of progress leads to the mistaken belief that the progressive sequence of events becomes \"a line of causation\", tempting the historian to go no further to investigate the causes of historical change. The focus on the present as the goal of historical change leads the historian to a special kind of abridgement, selecting only those events that seem important from the present point of view.\n\nButterfield's antidote to Whig history was \"to evoke a certain sensibility towards the past, the sensibility which studies the past 'for the sake of the past', which delights in the concrete and the complex, which 'goes out to meet the past', which searches for 'unlikenesses between past and present'\".\n\nA decade later however - if under wartime pressure - Butterfield would note of the Whig interpretation that \"Whatever it may have done to our history, it has had a wonderful effect on our politics...In every Englishman there is hidden something of a whig that seems to tug at the heart-strings\".\n\nButterfield's formulation has subsequently received much attention and the kind of historical writing he argued against in generalized terms is no longer academically respectable. Despite its polemical success, Butterfield's celebrated book itself has been criticized by David Cannadine as \"slight, confused, repetitive and superficial\".\n\nMichael Bentley analyses the \"Whig theory\" according to Butterfield as equivalent to the formation of a canon of 19th-century historians of England (such as William Stubbs, James Anthony Froude, E. A. Freeman, J. R. Green, W. E. H. Lecky, Lord Acton, J. R. Seeley, S. R. Gardiner, C. H. Firth and J. B. Bury) that in fact excludes few except Thomas Carlyle. The theory identifies the common factors and Bentley comments: Carlyle apart, the so-called Whigs were predominantly Christian, predominantly Anglican, thinkers for whom the Reformation supplied the critical theatre of enquiry when considering the origins of modern England. When they wrote about the history of the English constitution, as so many of them did, they approached their story from the standpoint of having Good News to relate.\n\nRoger Scruton, in his \"A Dictionary of Political Thought\" (1982), takes the theory underlying \"Whig history\" to be centrally concerned with social progress and reaction, with the progressives shown as victors and benefactors. Of the English tradition, Cannadine wrote: It was fiercely partisan and righteously judgemental, dividing the personnel of the past into the good and the bad. And it did so on the basis of the marked preference for liberal and progressive causes, rather than conservative and reactionary ones. [...] Whig history was, in short, an extremely biased view of the past: eager to hand out moral judgements, and distorted by teleology, anachronism and present-mindedness.\n\nPaul Rapin de Thoyras's history of England, published in 1723, became \"the classic Whig history\" for the first half of the eighteenth century. Rapin claimed that the English had preserved their ancient constitution against the absolutist tendencies of the Stuarts. However, Rapin's history lost its place as the standard history of England in the late 18th century and early 19th century to that of David Hume.\n\nIn \"The History of England\" (1754–1761), Hume challenged Whig views of the past and the Whig historians in turn attacked Hume; but they could not dent his history. In the early 19th century, some Whig historians came to incorporate Hume's views, dominant for the previous fifty years. These historians were members of the \"New Whigs\" around Charles James Fox (1749–1806) and Lord Holland (1773–1840) in opposition until 1830 and so \"needed a new historical philosophy\". Fox himself intended to write a history of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, but only managed the first year of James II's reign. A fragment was published in 1808. James Mackintosh then sought to write a Whig history of the Glorious Revolution, published in 1834 as the \"History of the Revolution in England in 1688\". William Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" (1765–1769) and Henry Hallam's \"Constitutional History of England\" (1827) reveal many Whiggish traits. According to Arthur Marwick, Hallam was the first Whig historian.\n\nHume still dominated English historiography, but this changed when Thomas Babington Macaulay, utilising Fox and Mackintosh's work and manuscript collections, published the first volumes of his \"The History of England from the Accession of James II\" in 1848. It proved an immediate success, replacing Hume's history and becoming the new orthodoxy. While Macaulay was a popular and celebrated historian of the Whig school, his work did not feature in Butterfield's 1931 book. According to Ernst Breisach, \"his style captivated the public as did his good sense of the past and firm Whiggish convictions\". The first chapter of Macaulay's \"History of England\" proposes:\n\nWilliam Stubbs (1825–1901), the constitutional historian and influential teacher of a generation of historians, became a crucial figure in the later survival and respectability of Whig history. According to Reba Soffer: \"His rhetorical gifts often concealed his combination of High Church Anglicanism, Whig history, and civic responsibility\".\n\nPolitical history was the usual venue for Whig history, but it also appears in other areas. Robert Hebert Quick (1831–1891) and G. A. N. Lowndes were the leaders of the Whig school of the history of education. In 1898, Quick explained the value of studying the history of educational reform, arguing that the great accomplishments of the past were cumulative and comprised the building blocks that “would raise us to a higher standing-point from which we may see much that will make the right road clearer to us”.\n\nFor Canada, Allan Greer argues:\nIt has been argued that the historiography of science is \"riddled with Whiggish history\". Like other Whig histories, Whig history of science tends to divide historical actors into \"good guys\" who are on the side of truth (as is now known), and \"bad guys\" who opposed the emergence of these truths because of ignorance or bias. From this Whiggish perspective, Ptolemy would be criticized because his astronomical system placed the Earth at the center of the universe while Aristarchus would be praised because he placed the Sun at the center of the solar system. This kind of evaluation ignores historical background and the evidence that was available at a particular time: did Aristarchus have evidence to support his idea that the Sun was at the center? Were there good reasons to reject Ptolemy's system before the sixteenth century?\n\nThe writing of Whig history of science is especially found in the writings of scientists and general historians, while this whiggish tendency is commonly opposed by professional historians of science. Nicholas Jardine describes the changing attitude to whiggishness this way:\n\nBy the mid-1970s, it had become commonplace among historians of science to employ the terms 'Whig' and 'Whiggish', often accompanied by one or more of 'hagiographic', 'internalist', 'triumphalist', even 'positivist', to denigrate grand narratives of scientific progress. At one level there is, indeed, an obvious parallel with the attacks on Whig constitutional history in the opening decades of the century. For, as P. B. M. Blaas has shown, those earlier attacks were part and parcel of a more general onslaught in the name of an autonomous, professional and scientific history, on popular, partisan and moralising historiography. Similarly, ... For post-WWII champions of the newly professionalized history of science the targets were quite different. Above all, they were out to establish a critical distance between the history of science and the teaching and promotion of the sciences. In particular, they were suspicious of the grand celebratory and didactic narratives of scientific discovery and progress that had proliferated in the inter-war years.\n\nMore recently, some scholars have argued that Whig history is essential to the history of science. At one level, \"the very term 'the history of science' has itself profoundly Whiggish implications. One may be reasonably clear what 'science' means in the 19th century and most of the 18th century. In the 17th century 'science' has very different meaning. For example chemistry is inextricably mixed up with alchemy. Before the 17th century dissecting out such a thing as 'science' in anything like the modern sense of the term involves profound distortions\". The science historians' rejection of whiggishness has been criticized by some scientists for failing to appreciate the temporal depth of scientific research.\n\nIn \"The Anthropic Cosmological Principle\" (1986, see anthropic principle for details), John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler identify Whiggishness (Whiggery) with a teleological principle of convergence in history to liberal democracy.\n\nDespite their shortcomings as interpretations of the past, Whiggish histories continue to influence popular understandings of political and social development. This persistence reflects the power of dramatic narratives that detail epic struggles for enlightened ideals. Aspects of the Whig interpretation are apparent in films, television, political rhetoric and even history textbooks: thus in the debate over Britishness, for example, David Marquand praised the Whig approach on the grounds that \"Ordered freedom and evolutionary progress \"have\" been among the hallmarks of modern British history, and they \"should\" command respect\".\n\nPopular understandings of human evolution and paleoanthropology may be imbued with a form of \"whiggishness\". See for example the celebrated scientific illustration, \"The March of Progress\" (1965). Most portrayals and fictionalized adaptations of the Scopes Trial, such as in \"Inherit the Wind\" (1955), subscribe to a Whig view of the trial and its aftermath. This was challenged by historian Edward J. Larson in his book \"Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion\" (1997), for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1998.\n\nRecent examples addressing moral progress include Steven Pinker's \"The Better Angels of Our Nature\" and Michael Shermer's \"The Moral Arc\". Both argue that the modern world is much more moral. Pinker is criticized for collapsing distinctions and misrepresenting humanity's past by Douglas P. Fry and R. Brian Ferguson in \"War, Peace and Human Nature\"; and Darcia Narvaez points out the opposite trajectory in \"Neurobiology and the Development of Human Morality: Evolution, Culture and Wisdom\".\n\n\n"}
