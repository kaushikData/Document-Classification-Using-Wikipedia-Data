His book \"California: A History of Upper and Lower California\", published in 1839, is perhaps the first full account in English of California. He is the brother of distinguished Scottish physician Sir John Forbes.\n\nForbes grew up in the counties of Banffshire and Aberdeenshire. At some point, he emigrated to Tepic, Mexico, where he made his living as a merchant. He is also recorded as having been the British consul to Mexico. It was during his time here that he wrote his book. One of the remarkable aspects of the book is that Forbes wrote it without ever having visited California at the time.\n\nAt the time Forbes was writing, California was a province of Mexico. Forbes drew upon the accounts of California's Franciscan Padres to inform his work, as well as other agents, including southern California cattleman and landowner Abel Stearns. His work contains extensive descriptions of Mexican California, including accounts of California's agriculture and its landscape. Forbes advocated that the United Kingdom take control of California, and suggested that the territory might be ceded to the UK in return for forgiving Mexico's debt to the British government.\n\nIn 1846, Barron, Forbes & Co., which was composed of Forbes, Eustace Barron (who served as consul before him), and the British vice-consul to California, James Alexander Forbes (no relation), purchased the New Almaden quicksilver mines from Andrés Castillero, which proved to be extremely profitable. However, another man, José de los Reyes Berreyesa, also lay claim to the mine on the basis that it lay on land given to him in a land grant by the Mexican governor of Alta California. Furthermore, Justo Larias also claimed ownership, and the United States government even stepped in to claim that the mine lay on public land. A complex legal case involving Mexican laws and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo described by \"The New York Times\" as \"one of the most remarkable civil trials in this or any other country\", \"United States v. Andres Castillero\" eventually reached the United States Supreme Court whereupon it was finally\ndecided in 1862 that, the mine was on the Larias grant, and that the furnaces and improvements of the company below the hill were on the Berreyessa grant. The company bought into these two titles and then sold the entire operation in 1864 to the Quicksilver Mining Company.\n\nForbes, however, had moved to London in 1848 to stay with his brother. They retired to Whitchurch-on-Thames in 1859 after his brother suffered a series of strokes. Forbes died in 1862 at the age of 84.\n"}

As a rhetorician, he was a determined opponent of Isocrates and his school. He is generally regarded as the author of the \"Rhetoric to Alexander\", an \"Art of Rhetoric\" included in the traditional corpus of Aristotle's works. Quintilian seems to refer to this work under Anaximenes' name in \"Institutio Oratoria\" 3.4.9, as the Italian Renaissance philologist Piero Vettori first recognized. This attribution has, however, been disputed by some scholars.\n\nThe hypothesis to Isocrates' \"Helen\" mentions that Anaximenes, too, had written a \"Helen\", \"though it is more a defense speech (\"apologia\") than an encomium,\" and concludes that he was \"the man who has written about Helen\" to whom Isocrates refers (Isoc. \"Helen\" 14). Jebb entertained the possibility that this work survives in the form of the \"Encomium of Helen\" ascribed to Gorgias: \"It appears not improbable that Anaximenes may have been the real author of the work ascribed to Gorgias.\"\n\nAccording to Pausanias (6.18.6), Anaximenes was \"the first who practised the art of speaking extemporaneously.\" He also worked as a logographer, having written the speech prosecuting Phryne according to Diodorus Periegetes (quoted by Athenaeus XIII.591e). The \"ethical\" fragments preserved in Stobaeus' \"Florilegium\" may represent \"some philosophical book.\"\n\nAnaximenes wrote a history of Greece in twelve books, stretching from the gods' origins to the death of Epaminondas at the Battle of Mantinea (\"Hellenica\", ), and a history of Philip of Macedon (\"Philippica\"). He was a favorite of Alexander the Great, whom he accompanied in his Persian campaigns, and wrote a third historical work on Alexander (however, Pausanias 6.18.6 expresses doubt about his authorship of an epic poem on Alexander). He was one of the eight exemplary historiographers included in the Alexandrian canon.\n\nDidymus reports that the work transmitted as speech 11 of Demosthenes (\"Against the Letter of Philip\") could be found in almost identical form in Book 7 of Anaximenes' \"Philippica\", and many scholars regard the work as a historiographic composition by Anaximenes. The \"Letter of Philip\" (speech 12) to which speech 11 seems to respond may also be by Anaximenes, or it may be an authentic letter by Philip, perhaps written with the aid of his advisers. The more ambitious theory of Wilhelm Nitsche, which assigned to Anaximenes a larger part of the Demosthenic corpus (speeches 10-13 and 25, letters 1-4, proems), can be rejected.\n\nAnaximenes was hostile to Theopompus, whom he sought to discredit with a libelous parody, \"Trikaranos\", published in Theopompus' style and under his name, attacking Athens, Sparta, and Thebes.\n\nPlutarch criticizes Anaximenes, together with Theopompus and Ephorus, for the \"rhetorical effects and grand periods\" these historians implausibly gave to men in the midst of urgent battlefield circumstances (\"Praecepta gerendae reipublicae\" 803b).\n\n"}

The ceremony itself was incorporated into the Archaeology Festival held at Cardiff University, with speakers including television broadcaster and historian, Bettany Hughes, who lectured on Helen of Troy. The awards were supported by English Heritage, and the Royal Archaeological Institute.\n\nThe first ever ceremony saw a generally positive reaction from the British archaeological community, including David Connelly of the British Archaeological Jobs Resource and Bryan Ward-Perkins of Oxford University. It was also reported in the press of many counties with nominated projects. As one article noted, 'Conesby moat... was shortlisted for a prestigious award with Current Archaeology... As part of their Archaeology Festival 2009 in Cardiff, the first-ever Current Archaeology Awards took place, with Conesby moat just one of five finalists in its category.'\n\nThe main prizes are awarded in the following five categories: The Jeffrey May Award (for best new article by a new writer for \"Current Archaeology\" or \"Current World Archaeology\"); Book of the Year; Research Project of the Year; Rescue Dig of the Year; and Archaeologist of the Year.\n\nThe Jeffrey May Award is named in honour of the late head of archaeology at the University of Nottingham and major contributor to \"Current Archaeology\", 'who oversaw a decade's work at Dragonby in Lincolnshire'. His obituary in \"The Times\" notes that 'He followed the principle that the aim of archaeology was not to solve problems for one’s own satisfaction or to impress colleagues, but to provide accurate information about the past for the enlightenment of all.'\n\nThe 2010 ceremony, brought in conjunction with the Portable Antiquities Scheme, was hosted by \"Current World Archaeology\" columnist Brian Fagan of the University of California, with support from the Ermine Street Guard. 2010 also saw the scope broadened to incorporate awards from other major archaeological organisations, representing work from amateur to academic and professional endeavours. This included the Awards for the Presentation of Heritage Research, sponsored by English Heritage, Historic Scotland, Cadw, the Royal Archaeology Institute and government bodies from both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Nominees for the 'Rescue Dig of the Year' included two Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) projects: 'This Wooden O: Discovering Shakespeare’s First Theatre' and 'Water-power in Medieval Greenwich'. The category was won by 'The Staffordshire Hoard'.\n\nThe 'Staffordshire Hoard' team's win was featured in an article by the Art Fund. On accepting the prize, Dr Kevin Leahy stated: 'This was very much a joint award, to be shared by the many people and organisations who had worked hard on the project.' As reported by the Birmingham News Room, Birmingham City Council Cabinet Member for Leisure, Culture and Sport, Cllr Martin Mullaney, 'congratulated the Staffordshire Hoard team after it scooped a top archaeology award'.\n\nThe 2011 ceremony was held at the British Museum, on Saturday 26 February. In January 2011, it was reported by the \"York Press\" that local team 'On-Site Archaeology' had been nominated in the 'Rescue Dig of the Year' category. Other nominees in the category included the 'Lanton Quarry' site, excavated by Archaeological Research Services LTD. Nominees in the Book of the Year category included \"European Influence on Celtic Art\" by Lloyd Laing and \"The Planning of Roman Roads and Walls in Northern England\" by John Poulter. The year's winners were voted for by readers and announced at the ceremony, as part of Archaeology Live 2011.

{"id": "30838567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30838567", "title": "Battle of Hingakaka", "text": "Battle of Hingakaka\n\nThe Battle of Hingakaka (sometimes \"Hiringakaka\") was fought between two Maori armies, an allied southern North Island army and a Tainui alliance army, near Ohaupo in the Waikato in the late 18th or early 19th centuries, and was reputedly \"the largest battle ever fought on New Zealand soil\".\n\nEarly New Zealand historian Percy Smith placed the battle at about 1780, basing the date purely on tribal genealogies, but evidence from Maori oral histories from warriors who fought in the battle and were still alive well into European times suggests that 1780 is far too early. The Ngati Whatua chief Te Murupaenga, who led his warriors into action in the battle, was judged by Samuel Marsden to be about 50 when he saw him in 1820. A date of 1780 would make him about 10 - far too young. Other Ngati Whatua sources correlated the date as two years before the attack on the Boyd, making the date 1807. However, according to Mana whenua traditions based on accounts from Ngati Maniapoto, Ngati Te Kanawa and Ngati Paretekawa traditional sources, they place the battle in or around the 1790-91 period. \n\nThe battle was fought between groups comprising many smaller allied hapu and iwi. The attackers, a force of 7,000 to 10,000 warriors, led by a Ngāti Toa chief Pikauterangi, from the Marokopa district of the lower North Island, invaded the Waipa District, to restore honour. He was aggrieved over the poor distribution of the kahawai fish harvest, according to Pei Te Hurinui Jones. This led to the killing of all members of the Ngati Apakura, who were one of the hapu hosting the fish feast. Other accounts say that Pikauterangi took the biggest fish for himself and he was seized and ducked to the point where he nearly drowned. In vengeance he killed Ngati Apakura, cooked their bodies and distributed them for eating amongst Ngati Kauwhata and Ngati Raukawa.\n\nThis \"take\", or cause, happened about three years before the battle. During this time Pikauterangi travelled around the lower North Island collecting a large force. He raised about 4,000 men from the Wellington region and a further 3,000 from the East Coast tribes of Ngati Porou and Ngati Kahungunu. This was combined with a separate force of Te Ati Awa, Ngati Ruanui and tribes from the Whanganui who had already been in battle with Ngati Maniapoto. \n\nIn response, the Waikato-Maniapoto alliance made preparations to establish a series of warning systems stretching from Kakepuku Maunga (Mountain) to Taupiri Maunga (Mountain) to alert the Waikato-Maniapoto forces of impending invasion, and a battle strategy to repel and defeat the invading forces of Pikauterangi, and constructed a series of \"Pa Pahu\" (Pa equipped with Warning devices) commencing with \nWhen alerted by Ngati Maniapoto of impending attack or invasion by external forces the Mangatoatoa Pa alarm was sounded, which carried to Waiari Pa, whose alarm was then sounded which was heard by Nukuhau (Pa), who sounded its alarm that was heard by Maniapoto (Pa), which sounded its alarm, to be heard by Taupiri and all of Waikato. In consequence, Waikato-Maniapoto would meet at Mangatoatoa as previously planned. \n\nPikauterangi's forces combined at Otorohanga in preparation for the attack on the Ngāti Maniapoto and the Waikato tribes who had allied with Ngati Whatua and Hauraki hapu.\n\nThe invaders were first spotted by Wahanui, a Maniapoto chief, just south of Otorohanga. He sent runners to the \"Pa Pahu\" at Mangatoato to raise the alarm, and warn the Waikato-Maniapoto defense forces of the impending attack. \n\nThe day before the battle the two armies drew up before each other. The combined Whatua-Haurakia and Waikato-Maniapoto forces, realising their numbers were far fewer at about 1,600 (some sources say 3,000), arranged bunches of feathers on top of fern to simulate the head feathers of warriors held in reserve, while other chiefs made war-like speeches in the fern to imaginary warriors. Choosing to draw the invading force into ambush, the Waikato defenders chose Te Mangeo ridge line just south of Lake Ngaroto (and west of where the old Ngaroto railway station was later) to launch their battle strategy \"Te Kawau Maro\".\n\nTe Rauangaanga, Te Wherowhero's father, placed his army on the high ground at the end of a narrow ridge in three groups. The invading force assembled at the foot of the spur (possibly near where the railway line is now). Huahua's Maniapoto forces initiated the \"Whewhera\" strategy of Te Kawau Maro in a spearhead attack, by charging down the hill into the centre of the invading force. The defenders reeled back, allowing the attackers to envelop them. The second group of the defending forces then rushed down the hill to hit the confused army of Pikauterangi in the flank. The turning point came when Pikauterangi was felled by a blow from Te Rauangaanga. In a panic the invaders tried to retreat along a narrow gap between the ridge and the lake but were ambushed by Tiriwa's men who had been waiting in the bush along the ridge. The Ngāti Toa were forced into the swamplands along the lake margin; some tried to swim the lake but were killed by patrols waiting on the far side.\n\nMany thousands died in the attack. Pei Jones of Tainui says that 16,000 warriors are said to have taken part. Combatants included Waikato-Maniapoto, Ngāti Toa and Ngāti Raukawa. Ngati Raukawa alone are said to have lost 1,600 warriors in battle, including two chiefs. Others came from Taranaki, from Kaipara in Northland, and as far east as Bay of Plenty and Hawke's Bay. So many chiefs died in the battle that it is known as \"Hingakaka\" (the fall of parrots), an echo of the traditional mass parrot hunt.\n\nThe sacred carving Te Uenuku was lost in the carnage, and not recovered until 1906.\n\nSources differ on the date of the battle, ranging from 1790, to \"about 1803\" and \"about 1807\" - with the latter now seeming the most likely.\n\nThe victorious Tainui warriors considered following up their decisive victory with a campaign against the tribes that had made war on them. However the tohunga of the Ngati Whatua had a bad dream in which he saw Ngapuhi launching an attack on the Kaipara in their absence. Ngati Whatua returned to their home land and defeated an attempted invasion by Ngapuhi. Other Tainui wanted to continue the war especially against Ngati Raukawa who were seriously weakened and retreated to Maungatautari. Waikato had had enough of fighting for the meantime but in 1810 set out down the west coast on a raid. At Rangikaiwaka on the coast they met a force of Ngati Tama and a Ngati Haua chief, Taiporutu, was killed. As a result of this another Waikato-Maniapoto war party set out to gain utu to punish Ngati Tama. The avenging warriors were ambushed and defeated by Ngati Tama and their chief Raparapa. \n\nAround 1819-20, during the Ngati Toa migration southwards after being evicted from Kawhia by Waikato-Maniapoto after the Te Arawi battle, Te Apihae Te Kawau, of Ngati Whatua, Kukutai, of Ngati Tipa (Waikato), and Peehi Tukorehu, of Ngati Paretekawa (Maniapoto), embarked with some 4-500 distinguished warriors on the \"Amio Whenua\" expedition to seek retribution or utu from the tribes who had sought to invade their ancestral Tribal homelands in the Waipa and Waikato territories during the Hingakaka battle of 1791. After encircling the land from Waikato and Maungatautari to Te Arawa and Tuhoe, and through the Tai Rawhiti district to Te Mahia, then on to Wairarpapa and across to Manawatu and Whanganui, the \"ope taua\" (war party) was eventually besieged at Pukerangiora Pa, on the banks of the Waitara River, Taranaki. A large Waikato-Maniapoto force under Te Wherowhero, Te Hiakai, Mama, and others was raised to break the siege and free the \"Amio Whenua Ope Taua\" (Amio Whenua War Party), and after being defeated in the battle of Motunui on their way to Pukerangiora with Te Rauparaha and Ngati Toa who were sheltering at Okoki with Te Atiawa and others at the time, they all returned to there homelands at Waikato and Waipa. \n\nThis led to further conflict and was the immediate background to the Ngati Toa forming alliances with Ngati Tama and Ngati Mutanga in the great Ngati Toa upheaval of 1821-22. This attack in turn led to further attacks and counterattacks, building to a climax in 1831 when a large Waikato contingent alleged to be about 4,000 warriors carried out a brutal and sustained campaign over several years led by the great Waikato warrior Te Wherowhero. When women and children attempted to flee the Pukerangiora pa they were mercilessly slaughtered and eaten. When the men emerged in a weakened state many of them jumped the cliff to avoid the Waikato warrior. The victims were tracked down and killed anyway. Te Wherowhero killed 150 prisoners with his favourite greenstone mere, only stopping when his arm swelled up from overuse, The Ngati Maniapoto Chief Tukorehu showed no mercy to the Pukerangiora people, the same people who saved his life and his war party 10 years earlier, placing the heads of the Pa's Chiefs, Whatitiri and Pekapeka on poles in front of the wharenui that housed him a decade before, this evil act was well known to all the other tribes.\n\n"}

{"id": "487237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=487237", "title": "Chain shift", "text": "Chain shift\n\nIn historical linguistics, a chain shift is a set of sound changes in which the change in pronunciation of one speech sound (typically, a phoneme) is linked to, and presumably causes, the change in pronunciation of other sounds as well. The sounds involved in a chain shift can be ordered into a \"chain\" in such a way that after the change is complete, each phoneme ends up sounding like what the phoneme before it in the chain sounded like \"before\" the change. The changes making up a chain shift, interpreted as rules of phonology, are in what is termed \"counterfeeding order\".\n\nA well-known example is the Great Vowel Shift, which was a chain shift that affected all of the long vowels in Middle English. The changes to the front vowels may be summarized as follows:\n\nA drag chain or pull chain is a chain shift in which the phoneme at the \"leading\" edge of the chain changes first. In the example above, the chain shift would be a pull chain if changed to first, opening up a space at the position of , which then moved to fill. A push chain is a chain shift in which the phoneme at the \"end\" of the chain moves first: in this example, if moved toward , a \"crowding\" effect would be created and would thus move toward , and so forth. It is not known which phonemes changed first during the Great Vowel Shift; many scholars believe the high vowels such as started the shift, but some suggest that the low vowels, such as , may have shifted first.\n\nDuring the Great Vowel Shift in the 15th and 16th centuries, all of the long vowels of Middle English, which correspond to tense vowels in Modern English, shifted pronunciation. The changes can be summarized as follows:\n\nMost vowels shifted to a higher place of articulation, so that the pronunciation of \"geese\" changed from to and \"broken\" from to . The high vowels and became diphthongs (for example, \"mice\" changed from to ), and the low back vowel was fronted, causing \"name\" to change from to .\n\nThe Great Vowel Shift occurred over centuries, and not all varieties of English were affected in the same ways. For example, some speakers in Scotland still pronounce \"house\" similarly to its sound in Middle English before the shift, as .\n\nA chain shift may affect only one regional dialect of a language, or it may begin in a particular regional dialect and then expand beyond the region in which it originated. A number of recent regional chain shifts have occurred in English. Perhaps the most well-known is the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, which is largely confined to the \"Inland North\" region of the United States. Other examples in North America are the California vowel shift, Southern vowel shift (in the Southern United States) and the Canadian Shift. In England, the Cockney vowel shift among working-class Londoners is familiar from its prominence in plays such as George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion (and the related musical My Fair Lady):\n\nMany chain shifts are vowel shifts, because many sets of vowels are naturally arranged on a multi-value scale (e.g. vowel height or frontness). However, chain shifts can also occur in consonants. A famous example of such a shift is the well-known First Germanic Sound Shift or Grimm's Law, in which the Proto-Indo-European voiceless stop consonants became fricatives, the plain voiced stops became voiceless, and the breathy voiced stops became plain voiced:\n\nAnother is the High German consonant shift which separated Old High German from other West Germanic dialects such as Old English, Old Frisian, and Old Saxon:\n\nThe Romance languages to the north and west of central Italy (e.g. French, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan and various northern Italian languages) are known for a set of chain shifts collectively termed \"lenition\", which affected stop consonants between vowels:\nIn this case, each sound became weaker (or more \"lenited\").\n\nIt is also possible for chain shifts to occur synchronically, within the phonology of a language as it exists at a single point in time.\n\nNzebi (or Njebi), a Bantu language of Gabon, has the following chain shift, triggered morphophonologically by certain tense/aspect suffixes:\n\nExamples follow:\n\nAnother example of a chain from Bedouin Hijazi Arabic involves vowel raising and deletion:\n\nIn nonfinal open syllables, raises to while in the same position is deleted.\n\nSynchronic chain shifts may be circular. An example of this is Xiamen tone or Taiwanese tone sandhi:\n\nThe contour tones are lowered to a lower tone, and the lowest tone (21) circles back to the highest tone (53).\n\nSynchronic chain shifts are an example of the theoretical problem of phonological opacity. Although easily accounted for in a derivational rule-based phonology, its analysis in standard parallel Optimality Theory is problematic.\n\n"}

Her father, Elliott Coates, was a merchant navy officer and her mother, Mary Peck, was an actress. Her parents' marriage ended in 1932, and she lived with foster parents during World War II while her mother worked in a munitions factory. She was educated at Eveline Girls High School in Bulawayo, and later at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, where she studied history and the Shona language. She married hydraulic engineer Brian Mitchell in 1956, and they had three children.\n\nMitchell's political activism began in 1966, when she campaigned to save a nursery school which was bulldozed by the government. The campaign later expanded to a broader one to improve education for black children. In 1968, she was involved with the Centre Party; although she ran as an independent candidate in the 1974 elections and for the National Unifying Force (NUF) in the 1977 elections.\n\nAfter Smith's 1970 declaration of Rhodesia as a republic, Mitchell was involved with arranging negotiations between Smith's Rhodesian Front and militant nationalists. Working with journalists Robert Cary and Willie Musarurwa, she compiled and published a definitive biographical compilation of leaders in the nationalist movement, \" African Nationalist Leaders in Rhodesia: Who's Who\". Although delighted at Zimbabwe's eventual independence under terms acceptable to the international community in 1980, Mitchell was critical of the Mugabe government's suppression of the media and political opposition. She and her husband moved to Britain in 2003. Brian died in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Mitchell's extensive collection of political clippings and papers were donated to the Hoover Institution, which opened them for public access, and to the University of Cape Town.\n\n"}

Carteret, the successor of James Fazy as leader of the latter, died in 1889, and henceforward Henri Fazy played a more and more prominent part in Radical Genevese politics. As a member of the canton of Geneva's executive, Fazy had charge of the department of finances, and was much criticised by Gustave Ador, the leader of the Democrats or Whigs. In 1880 his proposal to separate church and state in Geneva was rejected by the people, but was finally accepted by them in 1907.

{"id": "15920684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15920684", "title": "Henri Stahl", "text": "Henri Stahl\n\nHenri Joseph Stahl (also known as Henric, Enric, or Henry Stahl; April 29, 1877 – February 18, 1942) was a Romanian stenographer, graphologist, historian and fiction writer. Born to educated immigrant parents, he was a friend and disciple of Nicolae Iorga, doyen of modern Romanian historiography. Much of his work in the field resulted in a monographic and conservationist study of his native Bucharest, which was published by Iorga in 1910.\n\nStahl created an original system of a stenography, which worked as one of the basic Romanian stenography standards, and, as resident expert at the National Archives, set up the Romanian school of graphology and paleography. The author of humorous stories and memoirs, he also contributed the novel \"Un român în lună\" (\"A Romanian on the Moon\"), seen as one of the pioneering works in Romanian science fiction.\n\nIn addition to his scholarly and literary work, Stahl worked as a stenographer for public institutions, which allowed him to witness significant events in Romanian political history, and was a distinguished veteran of World War I. Stahl was the father of sociologist Henri H. Stahl and of novelist Henriette Yvonne Stahl, as well as the stepfather of Șerban Voinea, a political thinker and militant of the Romanian Social Democratic Party.\n\nHenri Stahl was the son of an Orientalist and lexicographer, Joseph \"Iosif\" Stahl (1820–1890), described in sources as \"a cross between an Alsatian man and a Swiss woman\", or, in the Stahls' genealogy, as a Bavarian baron. According to Henriette Yvonne Stahl, her grandfather was originally active in the Kingdom of Greece, in service to King Otto, before being taken prisoner by the Ottoman Empire. He owed his relocation to Wallachia (an autonomous subject of the Ottomans) to the intercession of Prince Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei, who employed him as a \"Dragoman\" of the court. Reportedly, his second wife, Irma Niard, known in Romanian as \"Irina Stahl\", was from a Normand family, the orphaned daughter of a prize-winning painter. From Joseph's earlier marriage, Henri had a half-sister, Ana \"Nety\" Stahl (1853–1929).\n\nThe Stahls lived in Wallachia, and later in unified Romania, as pedagogues and owners of a boarding school (although Irma never learned Romanian). By the time of Henri's birth, Joseph had had a lengthy career in publishing, with phrasebooks for German, French or Romanian, beginning with the 1853 \"Kleine Walachische Sprachlehre\".\n\nBorn in Bucharest, Henri was himself a polyglot and a student of history. He enlisted at the city's university, where he became one of Iorga's star students and fervent followers. According to sociologist Mircea Ioanid, \"he made himself famous with his modest but fruitful activities in the public sphere, but most of all though his cultural pioneering\". A graduate of the Faculty of Letters, Stahl invented a method for Romanian stenography, which was based on Duployan shorthand. He outlined its rules in a 1900 textbook: \"Metoda pentru a stenografia cu alfabetul latin pentru uzul studenților, ziariștilor și tuturor celor care au de scris repede\" (\"A Method for Stenography in the Latin Alphabet, Useful to Students, Journalists and All Those Who Have to Write Fast\"). By then, Stahl had been employed as a reviewer-stenographer by the Parliament of Romania.\n\nAround 1900, Stahl was in France, where he published a guide to the Duployan method and a stenotype how-to: \"La machine à écrire—machine à stenographier\". He fell deeply in love with a Blanche-Alexandrine Francis Boeuve, who taught at her mother's school in Bucharest. She was three years his senior, had worked as a seamstress, and had French Jewish origins. From a previous relationship, Blanche had a six-year-old son, Gaston.\n\nThe affair angered Irma Stahl, who sacked Blanche after she let known that she carried Stahl's child. Moving in with her sister in Saint-Avold, Lorraine, she gave birth to a daughter, Henriette. The forceful separation and Henriette's health problems as an infant led Stahl to contemplate suicide; Irma Stahl eventually yielded to his threats, allowing mother and daughter to return and live with her in Bucharest.\n\nHenri legally married Blanche in 1901. The couple soon had another son, Henri H. Stahl. Blanche became an expert in touch typing, and, after her move to Romania, wrote several textbooks of her own. By then, Henri was experimenting with political and humorous writing. In 1901, he became a contributor to Ion Luca Caragiale's satirical sheet, \"Moftul Român\". He was an imitator of Caragiale, and, according to Iorga, was one of the best, fitted with a \"tender understanding of things\". Having acquired a first-hand understanding of the emerging Romanian trends in public speaking, Stahl also published a September 1906 notice on the \"style of Romanian orators\" in the Blaj review \"Revista Politică și Literară\".\n\nIn 1903, Stahl was working for the Chancellery of the Romanian Senate and was teacher at his mother and wife's boarding school on Brutus Street (where he also resided). Stahl resumed his close contacts with Iorga: Iorga regularly visited Stahl's home and office, where he freely dictated his books for Stahl to write down. Stahl also joined the staff of Iorga's summer school in Vălenii de Munte, where, in 1908, he was teaching stenography courses. Iorga's academic press of Vălenii put out his 1909 \"Curs complect de stenografie cu vocale\" (\"Complete Course of Stenography, Vowels Included\"). Also that year, he put out a French-language introduction to French and German stenography, lithographed in Bucharest.\n\nIn addition to such contributions, Stahl preserved a passion for oral history and the history of Bucharest. He walked through the city, made notes of its interesting features, created stone rubs from old inscriptions, and interviewed senior citizens. His son Henri Jr, who followed him on such excursions, recalls: \"He had the special gift of being able to converse with simple people, old and young alike, winning them over with his own matching simplicity, addressing them in their own language, in the very spirit of their mentality.\" As literary critic Dan C. Mihăilescu notes, Stahl and Iorga were both conservative adversaries of 20th-century modernization, who disliked popular culture and feared the growth of the \"petite bourgeoisie\". Henri Jr also sees his father as a disciple of Iorga's traditionalist doctrine, or \"Sămănătorism\".\n\nOccasionally, Stahl returned to fiction writing, producing \"Un român în lună\", the found manuscript of space exploration: a newspaperman chances upon a mysterious text, which turns out to be the stenographic account of a Romanian voyage to the Moon. Stahl described his novel as more of a \"popular treatise in astronomy\", a \"well-written\" and accessible illustration of scientific facts. In his 1915 review of the novel, Mihail Sevastos of \"Viața Românească\" noted: \"Mr. Stahl imagined himself a Flammarion of the Romanians\". According to philologist Petru Iamandi, the book's \"rather obvious positivism\" is balanced by \"enthusiasm\" and \"funny remarks\", but \"the lack of a genuine conflict [is] the main shortcoming of Stahl's book\". As noted in 1998 by cultural journalist Cristian Tudor Popescu, \"Un român în lună\" can indeed be considered important for the emergence of Romanian science fiction, but it is also \"negligent\" and \"inferior\" to its Western models, from Edgar Allan Poe to Jules Verne. The unique element, Popescu suggests, is the explorer's motivation: he has left Earth out of misanthropy and disgust for politicking, but also for a belief in human transcendence (an \"Omega Point\", according to Popescu). Sevastos pointed out that Stahl's \"social criticism\" was of the \"aggressive\" kind, quoting a passage in which the narrator reads Iorga's initials, \"dear as they will once be to all Romanians\", into the lunar surface.\n\nStahl considered publishing the work, and showed it to Iorga for a critical opinion. He met Iorga's opposition, who asked him \"to forget the moon and stars\" and write a new book using the style around the first chapter, in which Stahl depicts life in turn-of-the-century Bucharest. Therefore, Stahl's literary debut was in 1910 with \"Bucureștii ce se duc\" (\"Vanishing Bucharest\"), serialized in Iorga's \"Neamul Românesc\" journal, then bound together as a volume issued in Vălenii. Iorga later described Stahl, alongside Ion Agârbiceanu, Romulus Cioflec and Dumitru C. Moruzi, as \"Neamul Românesc\"s leading prose writer.\n\nThe book is feted for its colorful depictions of Bucharesters at the beginning of the 20th century, but also for outlining the conservative thesis favored at \"Neamul Românesc\". Stahl sees modern Bucharest as a playing ground for handmaidens and their aroused admirers, riddled with \"moronic\" pastimes such as binge drinking and visits to the City Morgue. Stahl also protests against the Haussmannian renovation of downtown Bucharest, and proposes that all condemned buildings be photographed and inventoried for historical reference.\n\nStahl followed up with humorous sketch stories: \"Dela manevre\" (\"From the Maneuvers\"), printed by Iorga in 1912, and the 1915 \"Macabre și viceversa\" (\"Macabre Ones and Vice Versa\"). He did eventually publish his science fiction novel: first in 1913, serialized in Victor Anestin's \"Ziarul Călătoriilor\" magazine, then as a single volume in 1914. In the latter popular edition, produced at the Bucharest Institute of Graphic Arts, the \"astronomical novel\" was illustrated by Stoica D. and Ary Murnu. At an unknown later date, Stahl also produced a volume of \"Schițe parlamentare\" (\"Parliamentary Sketches\"), with models of oratory, samples of ignominious behavior, and memoirs of parliamentary disputes.\n\nDuring the early 1910s, Stahl made visits to the Romanian communities of Austria-Hungary, and in particular to those of Transylvania and Partium. Under Germanic influence, Transylvanian Romanian intellectuals had devised their own shorthand system, codified by Vasile Vlaicu. However, Stahl was contracted by Romanian National Party leaders to record their February 1911 meeting with the constituents of Arad, Békés and Csanád counties, which doubled as a protest against Magyarization policies and for universal suffrage. Stahl was enthusiastic about the events, and contrasted the enthusiasm and sincerity of Transylvanians with the politicking of his Bucharest employers. He left notes on the \"natural bond between the people and the leaders\", and found the Partium peasants to be exceptionally polite, as well as \"fair, intelligent, and proud\".\n\nStahl was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces in 1916, when Romania entered World War I as an enemy of Austria-Hungary. He was a reserve lieutenant in the 6th (Mihai Viteazu) Regiment. He saw action during the early stages of the Romanian Campaign, but was badly wounded in the trenches during the battles of September 1916. Losing consciousness, he was dragged away and rescued by his peasant batman, and was under treatment at Gerota hospital when Iorga dedicated him an encomium in \"Neamul Românesc\" (September 23, 1916). He was a convalescent in Ploiești when the Central Powers occupied southern Romania.\n\nLeaving his children and wife behind, Stahl escaped to Moldavia, where the Romanian government authorities resided. During 1917, he resumed his collaboration with Iorga, who was putting out in Iași, the provisional capital, a new review called \"Drum Drept\". He resumed his work as stenographer, and followed Romanian parliamentarians on their refuge to Russia's Kherson Governorate. He was caught there by the October Revolution, and witnessed the mounting tensions between anticommunist Romanians and Rumcherod officials. Blanche and the Stahl children lived in occupied Bucharest, and were helped to survive by their peasant acquaintances, through contraband goods. Stahl eventually returned to the occupied capital after the Romanian armistice (April 1918), and had to watch resentfully as the German Army embarked on a campaign of hasty requisitions.\n\nStahl resumed his work in parliament after the German capitulation of November. During the late 1910s and early 1920s, he was vice president of the Deputies' Assembly corps of stenographers, in which capacity he taught free lessons in stenography to university students. For that purpose, he issued a 1919 \"Curs de stenografie parlamentară\" (\"Parliamentary Stenography Course\"). In interwar Greater Romania, Stahl expanded the focus of his investigations and interviews, with trips to mountain localities such as Breaza and Covasna, and resumed his literary work, in the eclectic newspaper \"Cuget Românesc\". \"Un român în lună\" went through a second edition in 1925.\n\nBoth of Stahl's male heirs were involved in social sciences. Known to the world as \"Șerban Voinea\" (a pseudonym he first used in 1919), Gaston became a Romanian citizen in 1929. He was a Marxist theoretician, seen by Ioanid as one of \"worldwide value\" and a \"classic of Romanian sociology\", whose semi-legal activities in the Socialist Party of Romania resulted in prosecution at the \"Dealul Spirii Trial\". Living abroad during much of the 1920s, he was a graduate of several academic institutions, including the Free College of Social Sciences. Returning to Romania in the 1930s, Voinea primarily worked as a radio journalist, and was the theoretical voice of the reformist and pro-Western Romanian Social Democratic Party. Henri Jr was himself a student of Iorga, but not a follower, and alienated Iorga when he stated his preference for rural sociology over history. As a researcher, he brought up empirical evidence which supported some of Iorga's core theses, but criticized his attempts to silence other opponents. Faced with financial difficulties for much of his life, he supplemented his income by working in stenography, which he had learned from his father.\n\nTo her father's despair, Henriette had a troubled childhood, and shunned academic life in favor of sheer experimentation. She was, by contemporary accounts, an extraordinarily beautiful woman. She graduated from the Bucharest School of Drama, but enjoyed most acclaim as a writer. Her father encouraged her, submitting her debut novel \"Voica\" to a literary contest in 1924. From 1931 to 1944, Henriette was married to the poet-translator Ion Vinea, and notoriously shared his passion for hard drugs, which inspired her to write violently modernist novels.\n\nFrom 1925, Stahl's expertise in graphology was harnessed by the National Archives of Romania and its Superior School of Archivists and Paleographers. Stahl's work for those years includes a 1926 textbook of graphology. It was positively reviewed at the time by the social scientist Mihai Ralea, according to whom \"given [Stahl's] technical expertise, nobody would have been better suited for the task than him\". The textbook notably included writing samples \"from virtually all of modern Romania's personalities\", alongside character sketches. He had also published, in 1925, the war-themed volume of sketches called \"Spion\" (\"A Spy\"), praised by Ralea for its authenticity.\n\nA second edition of \"Bucureștii ce se duc\" came out in 1935 at E. Marvan Publishers, illustrated with 175 photographs taken by Stahl himself. Stahl published in 1936 his own contribution in the field of paleography: a textbook for Old Church Slavonic, in collaboration with the Slavist Damian P. Bogdan. He retired from the Archivists' School in 1938, when Aurel Sacerdoțeanu took over as Director, but was still considered one of the school's prime experts, and honored by Sacerdoțeanu as the founder of Romanian graphology.\n\nStahl died in February 1942. This occurred during the Nazi-allied dictatorship of Ion Antonescu (to which his son Voinea was structurally opposed), while the Stahl children had come under official investigation, to decide whether the racial laws applied to them. The stenographer-historian was buried in Bucharest's Bellu cemetery, the Roman Catholic section. His death is recorded in the diary of a marginalized politician, Constantin Argetoianu, right after news of General Wavell's injury: \"Death of Henri Stahl, the known stenographer. Stahl was also a remarkable writer and a very decent man. We bury with him another piece of our past, the past of old folks...\" Stahl's book of World War I memoirs, titled \"Cu Parlamentul în U.R.S.S.\" (\"With the Parliament in the USSR\"), was issued later that month, at the height of Romania's involvement in the anti-Soviet war.\n\nUpon the end of the war, Stahl's two male heirs wrote Romania's first course in Marxist sociology. Voinea became ambassador of Romania in Bern, but fell out with the communist regime and defected to the West. He worked for the French Radio and Television Broadcasting and was active within the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The other Stahls remained in Romania. Henriette's relation to Voinea resulted in the censoring of her novels, and she was banned from publishing for some 10 years. She was protected from imprisonment by her ten-year-long affair with Petru Dumitriu, the official communist poet. When Dumitriu himself defected in 1960, Henriette was detained for several months and made to confess that she had been Dumitriu's ghostwriter. She was later released, and continued to publish, in both Romania and her native France, until well into her seventies; she died in 1984.\n\nHarassed by Securitate agents and prevented from publishing until the 1960s (during which interval he had to work in systematization), Henri H. Stahl was eventually allowed to join the editorial staffs of \"Biblioteca Historica Romaniae\" and \"Viitorul Social\". He was by then lovingly married to the visual artist Margareta Stahl. His earlier affair with Maria Costin had produced a son, Paul H. Stahl; trained in sociology and art history, he escaped to France in 1969, to teach at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences. Henri was fully reinstated after the 1989 Revolution, and welcomed into the Romanian Academy shortly before his death, which occurred on September 9, 1991.\n\nThe censorship which touched his descendants under communism did not affect Henri Sr's own cultural legacy. New editions of \"Un român în lună\" saw print in 1958 and 1966. Years after the anticommunist revolution, the Stahl method was still being taught in stenography classes. In 2002, Editura Domino put out a new version of \"Bucureștii ce se duc\", but this reissue was incomplete and lacked a critical introduction. \"Schițe parlamentare\" was also reissued in 2003.\n\n"}
{"id": "1394882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1394882", "title": "History of Portuguese", "text": "History of Portuguese\n\nThe Portuguese language developed in the Western Iberian Peninsula from Latin spoken by Roman soldiers and colonists starting in the 3rd century BC. Old Portuguese, also known as Galician-Portuguese, began to diverge from other Romance languages after the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Germanic invasions, also known as barbarian invasions in the 5th century and started appearing in written documents around the 9th century. By the 13th century, Galician-Portuguese had become a mature language with its own literature and began to split into two languages. However, the debate of whether Galician and Portuguese are nowadays varieties of the same language, much like American English or British English, is still present. In all aspects—phonology, morphology, lexicon and syntax—Portuguese is essentially the result of an organic evolution of Vulgar Latin with some influences from other languages, namely the native Gallaecian and Lusitanian languages spoken prior to the Roman domination.\n\nArriving on the Iberian Peninsula in 218 BC, the ancient Romans brought with them Latin, from which all Romance languages descend. The language was spread by arriving Roman soldiers, settlers and merchants, who built Roman cities mostly near the settlements of previous civilizations. Later, the inhabitants of the cities of Lusitania and the rest of Romanized Iberia were recognized as citizens of Rome.\n\nRoman control of the western part of Hispania was not consolidated until the campaigns of Augustus in 26 BC. Although the western territories to the south of the Tagus River were only conquered after the victory of Licinius Crassus in the year 93 BC, only an estimated four hundred words of the native languages persist in modern Portuguese. After 200 years of wars first with the Carthaginians in the Eastern part of the peninsula, and then the local inhabitants, emperor Augustus conquered the whole peninsula, which was named Hispania. He then divided it into three provinces, Hispania Tarraconensis, Hispania Baetica, and Lusitania, the latter of which included most of modern Portugal. In the 3rd century, emperor Diocletian split Tarraconensis into three, creating the adjacent province of Gallaecia, which geographically enclosed the remaining part of Portugal, and modern-day Galicia (in the northwestern region of Spain).\n\nBetween AD 409 and 711, as the Roman Empire was collapsing, the Iberian Peninsula was invaded by peoples of Germanic origin, known by the Romans as Barbarians. The Barbarians (mainly Suevi and Visigoths) largely absorbed the Roman culture and language of the peninsula; however, since the Roman schools and administration were closed and Europe entered the Early Middle Ages, the Vulgar Latin language of ordinary people was left free to evolve on its own and the uniformity of the language across the Iberian Peninsula broke down. In the north-western part of the Peninsula (today's Northern Portugal and Galicia), Vulgar Latin began gaining a growing number of local characteristics, leading to the formation of what linguists today call Galician-Portuguese. The Germanic languages influenced Galician-Portuguese by introducing words often linked to the military like \"guerra\" (war) or \"laverca\" (lark), placenames such as (Resende), animals like \"ganso\" (goose), \"texugo\" (badger), human feelings such as \"orgulho\" (pride), verbs like \"brigar\" (to fight), suffixes like \"reguengo\" (royal domain) and everyday objects such as \"frasco\" (flask).\n\nFrom 711, with the Moorish invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, Arabic was adopted as the administrative language in the conquered regions. However, much of the population continued to speak the Latin-derived Romance dialects, called collectively by modern linguists Mozarabic. The main effect of the Arabic influence was lexical. Modern Portuguese has between 400 up to as much as 800 words of Arabic origin (many were absorbed indirectly through Mozarabic) especially relating to food, agriculture and the crafts, which have no cognates in other Romance languages except in Spanish from which in fact, Portuguese borrowed many of its Arabic-derived words. The Arabic influence is also visible in placenames, especially in the southern provinces, such as the Algarve, Alfama and Fátima.\nHowever, there are no Arabic loan words in the lexicon related to human feelings or emotions; those are all of Latin, Germanic or Celtic origin.\n\nThe oldest surviving records containing written Galician-Portuguese are documents from the 9th century. In these official documents, bits of Galician-Portuguese found its way into texts that were written in Latin. Today, this phase is known as \"Proto-Portuguese\" simply because the earliest of these documents are from the former County of Portugal, although Portuguese and Galician were still a single language. This period lasted until the 12th century.\n\nWhat modern scholars call \"Galician-Portuguese\" was originally the native language of the medieval Kingdom of Galicia, which was founded in 410 and included the northern part of present-day Portugal. It appears to have also been used regularly in other Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula as the language for lyric song. It was employed by poets from throughout the non-Basque medieval Christian kingdoms of the peninsula; including Leonese, Castilian, Aragonese and Catalan. It is also the language used in the \"Cantigas de Santa Maria\". These songs were traditionally attributed to Alfonso X, a Castilian king, though more recent work shows that they must have been composed in collaboration with many translators, poets and musicians.\n\nPortugal was formally recognized as an independent kingdom in 1143 by the Kingdom of León, into which Galicia was incorporated at the time, with Afonso Henriques as its first king. In 1290, King Diniz created the first Portuguese University in Lisbon (the \"Estudo Geral\") and decreed that the language of the Portuguese, then simply called the \"Vulgar language\" (i.e. Vulgar Latin) should be used in preference to Latin and known as the \"Portuguese language\". In 1296, Portuguese was adopted by the Royal Chancellary and was used not only in poetry but also when writing law and in notaries. In the first period of \"Old Portuguese\" (from 12th to the 14th century), the language came gradually to be used in official documents. With the political separation of the County of Portugal from Galicia, Galician-Portuguese lost its unity and slowly became two increasingly distinct languages. This growing difference accelerated when Galicia became part of Castile and Galician was increasingly influenced by Castilian. Meanwhile, the southern variant of Galician-Portuguese became the modern Portuguese language within the Kingdom of Portugal and its empire.\n\nThe end of \"Old Portuguese\" was marked by the publication of the \"Cancioneiro Geral\" by Garcia de Resende, in 1516.\n\n\"Modern Portuguese\" developed from the early 16th century to the present. During the Renaissance, scholars and writers borrowed many words from classical Latin (learned words borrowed from Latin also came from Renaissance Latin) and ancient Greek, which increased the complexity of the Portuguese lexicon. Most literate Portuguese speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in Portuguese. As with most European vernacular languages, the standardization of the Portuguese language was propelled by the development of the printing press. In 1536 Fernão de Oliveira published his \"Grammatica da lingoagem portuguesa\" in Lisbon, the first Portuguese grammar. The work of this heterodox Dominican priest, philologist and mariner was soon followed. In 1540, João de Barros crown officer published his \"Gramática da Língua Portuguesa\" along with moral dialogues and basics of the Catholic Church to help teaching young aristocrats. This second work, illustrated with woodcuts, is considered the world's first printed illustrated text book.\n\nThe second period of Old Portuguese covers the time from the 14th to the 16th centuries and is marked by the Portuguese discoveries of the 15th and 16th centuries. In that time, colonisers, traders and missionaries spread the Portuguese language to many regions in Africa, Asia and The Americas. Today most Portuguese speakers live in Brazil, the biggest former colony of Portugal. By the mid-16th century, Portuguese had become a \"lingua franca\" in Asia and Africa, used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and Europeans of all nationalities. In Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) several kings became fluent speakers of Portuguese, and nobles often took Portuguese names. The spread of the language was helped by its association with the Catholic missionary efforts, which led to its being called \"Cristão\" (\"Christian\") in many places. The \"Nippo Jisho\", a Japanese–Portuguese dictionary written in 1603, was a product of Jesuit missionary activity in Japan. The language continued to be popular in parts of Asia until the 19th century, despite the severe measures taken by the Dutch to abolish it in Ceylon and Indonesia.\n\nSome Portuguese-speaking Christian communities in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Indonesia preserved their language even after they were isolated from Portugal. The language has largely changed in these communities and has evolved through the centuries into several Portuguese creoles. Also, a considerable number of words of Portuguese origin are found in Tetum, the national language of East Timor, such as \"lee\" \"to read\" (from \"ler\"), \"aprende\" \"to learn\" (from \"aprender\") and \"tenke\" \"to have to\" (from \"tem que\"). Portuguese words entered the lexicons of many other languages, such as \"pan\" \"bread\" (from \"pão\") in Japanese (see Japanese words of Portuguese origin), \"sepatu\" \"shoe\" (from \"sapato\") in Indonesian, \"keju\" \"cheese\" (from \"queijo\") in Malay and \"meza\" \"table\" (from \"mesa\") in Swahili. Due to the vast expanse of the Portuguese Empire, there are also numerous words that entered English (see: List of English words of Portuguese origin) such as \"albino\", \"baroque\", \"mosquito\", \"potato\", \"savvy\" and \"zebra\".\n\nBoth in morphology and in syntax, Portuguese represents an organic transformation of Latin without the direct intervention of any foreign language. The sounds, grammatical forms, and syntactical types, with a few exceptions, are derived from Latin, and almost 80% of its vocabulary is still derived from the language of Rome. Some of the changes began during the Empire, others took place later. A few words remained virtually unchanged, like \"carro\", \"taberna\" (\"tavern\"), or even returned to a form close to the original, such as \"coxa\" (\"thigh\") – in this case, however, only the spelling looks identical: Latin ⟨\"x\"⟩ and Portuguese ⟨\"x\"⟩ designate two completely different sounds, and respectively.\n\nLearned Latinisms were formed in the late Middle Ages, due to the use of Church Latin by the Catholic Church, and during the Renaissance, when Classical antiquity in general, and Literary Latin in particular, enjoyed great prestige. Thus, for example, Latin \"aurum\", which had originated \"ouro\" (\"gold\") and \"dourado\" (\"golden\"), was re-introduced as the adjective \"áureo\" (\"golden\"). In the same way, \"locālem\" (\"place\"), which had evolved to \"lugar\", was later reintroduced as the more erudite \"local\". Many erudite Greek words and combining elements were also introduced or reintroduced in this way. Because of this, many Latin words are still familiar to Portuguese speakers.\n\nThe letter ⟨\"v\"⟩ was the vowel we know today as ⟨\"u\"⟩, and ⟨\"c\"⟩ was always pronounced , so \"centum\" was originally pronounced . Later Latinisms are marked with (L).\nPalatalization of voiceless stops—the consonants and assimilated with the high vowels and , and with the semivowel . \nA more ancient evolution was \nVoicing—some consonants did not disappear but rather evolved with voiceless stops becoming voiced stops and voiced stops becoming voiced fricatives in certain positions, a common type of sound change:\n\nLenition—consonant clusters, especially long (geminate) consonants, were simplified:\n\nPhoneme [b] evolved as [v]. The phoneme was generally derived either (1) from an allophone of Latin between vowels or (2) from the Latin phoneme corresponding to the letter ⟨v⟩ (pronounced in Classical Latin, but later fortified to the status of a fricative consonant in Vulgar Latin). \n\n\nElision—the consonants and of Vulgar Latin were deleted between vowels, after which sometimes the vowels around them coalesced, or an epenthetic semivowel was introduced between them. Original geminates , persisted, later becoming single , .\n\nPalatalization of liquids and nasals—the consonants and assimilated with the semivowel , producing the palatals \"lh\" and \"nh\" : \n\nIn medieval Galician-Portuguese, and between vowels or at the end of a syllable became the velar nasal phoneme , leading to regressive nasalization of the preceding vowel as a secondary phonetic effect. This consonant was then at a later stage lost or modified in Portuguese, although it was retained in Galician in some words (e.g. modern \"unha\" () identical in pronunciation to medieval \"hũa\").\n\nThis change produced one of the most striking phonological differences between Portuguese and Spanish. The history of nasal vowels in hiatus with a previous or following vowel is complex, depending on the identity of the two vowels and the position of the stress.\n\n1. If the vowels were near each other, they collapsed into a single vowel (nasal or oral, according to the nasality of the stressed vowel):\n\n2. Otherwise, if the second vowel was more closed, the result was usually a nasal diphthong:\n\n3. If the second vowel was more open, or as open, nasalization was lost:\n\n4. If the first vowel was , however, nasalization evolved to a palatal nasal consonant, inserted between the two vowels:\n\nProgressive nasalization—The spread of nasalization forward from a nasal consonant, especially . \n\nEpenthesis—the insertion of a sound to break up a combination of vowels which was difficult to pronounce: \n\nExamples such as the former two have been used by some authors to argue that the digraph \"nh\" was a nasal approximant in medieval Portuguese, and thus its pronunciation in most dialects of Brazil and São Tomé and Príncipe is the original one.\n\nDissimilation—Modification of a sound by the influence of neighbouring sounds; similar became different over time, so as to ease pronunciation.\n\n1. Between vowels:\n\n2. Between consonants:\n\nMetathesis—a sound change that alters the order of phonemes in a word. \nSemi-vowel metathesis: \nConsonant metathesis in and : \nVowel metathesis: \n\nOld Portuguese had seven sibilants: lamino-alveolar affricates (⟨\"c\"⟩ before ⟨\"e/i\"⟩, ⟨\"ç\"⟩ elsewhere) and (⟨\"z\"⟩); apico-alveolar fricatives (⟨\"s\"⟩, or ⟨\"ss\"⟩ between vowels) and (⟨\"s\"⟩ between vowels); palato-alveolar fricatives (⟨\"x\"⟩) and , earlier (⟨\"j\"⟩, also ⟨\"g\"⟩ before ⟨\"e/i\"⟩); and palato-alveolar affricate (⟨\"ch\"⟩). This system was identical to the system of Old Spanish, and Portuguese followed the same path as Old Spanish in deaffricating the sibilants and into lamino-alveolar fricatives that still remained distinct from the apico-alveolar consonants. This produced a system of six fricatives and one affricate, which is still maintained in small parts of northeast Portuguese province of Trás-os-Montes and in the adjacent Mirandese language; but in most places, these seven sounds have been reduced to four.\n\nEverywhere except in the above-mentioned parts of Trás-os-Montes, the lamino-alveolar and apico-alveolar fricatives merged. (This appears to have happened no earlier than the seventeenth century, on the evidence of the spelling system used by Alexandre de Rhodes to represent Middle Vietnamese). In northern Portugal and Galicia, they became apico-alveolars (as in the central and northern peninsular Spanish pronunciation of ). In most of Brazil, they became lamino-alveolar consonants (as in the English pronunciation of and ). In central and southern Portugal (and in Rio de Janeiro and surrounding areas, due to the relocation of the Portuguese nobility in the early 1800s), they merged as lamino-alveolars before vowels, but as palato-alveolar elsewhere. Meanwhile, eventually lost its affrication and merged with , although is maintained throughout Trás-os-Montes.\n\nIt appears that the sound written ⟨\"v\"⟩ was at one point during the medieval period pronounced as a voiced bilabial fricative . Subsequently, it either changed into a labiodental fricative (as in central and southern Portugal, and hence in Brazil), or merged into (as in northern Portugal and Galicia, similarly to modern Spanish). Also similarly to modern Spanish, the voiced stops eventually became pronounced as fricatives between vowels and after consonants, other than in the clusters (the nasals were presumably still pronounced in these clusters, rather than simply reflected as a nasal vowel). However, this change happened after the colonization of Brazil, and never affected Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nFinal unstressed was subsequently raised to . Final was eventually raised to in both Portugal and Brazil, but independently. Final unstressed was likewise raised to in Brazil, but shifted to in Portugal (now barely pronounced). In Portugal (but not in Brazil), these changes have come to affect almost all unstressed instances of ; but not (which now appears as ), nor the former sequences (which now appear as respectively), nor in syllables closed by stop consonants (e.g. in \"secção\" \"section\", \"optar\" \"to choose\"). Hence in Portugal \"pesar\" \"to weigh\" but \"pregar\" \"to preach\" (former \"preegar\" < \"praedicāre\"); \"morar\" \"to live\" , but \"corado\" \"blushing\" (former \"coorado\" < \"colōrātum\"), \"roubar\" \"to rob\" . (In Brazil these appear as .) Recently in Rio de Janeiro (and rapidly spreading to other parts of Brazil), and have been affricated to and before , including from unstressed .\n\nOld Portuguese had a large number of occurrences of hiatus (two vowels next to each other with no consonant in between), as a result of the loss of Latin between vowels. In the transition to modern Portuguese, these were resolved in a complex but largely regular fashion, either remaining, compressing into a single vowel, turning into a diphthong, or gaining an epenthetic consonant such as or ; see above.\n\nPortuguese traditionally had two alveolar rhotic consonants, a flap and trill , as in Spanish. In most areas of Portugal the trill has passed into a uvular fricative . In most parts of Brazil, however, has become an \"unvoiced\" fricative (variously ), and all instances of not preceding a vowel have been likewise affected. (When final, this sound is sometimes not pronounced at all.)\n\n\n"}

It was held on 12 occasions: annually from 1982 to 1991, and then biannually in 1993 and 1995. The first three Book Fairs took place in different areas of London — Islington, Lambeth and Acton — representing the respective bases of the three founding organisers: New Beacon Books, Race Today Publications and Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications. Additionally, from 1985, there were associated book fairs held elsewhere in England, in Manchester (1985–91, 1995) and Bradford (1985–93), Leeds (1993, 1995), and in 1993 and 1995 in Glasgow, Scotland. In 1987 and 1988, a sister event — the Caribbean Peoples International Bookfair and Bookfair Festival — took place in Trinidad, organised by the Oilfields Workers Trade Union there. \n\nThe ethos of the Book Fair was \"to mark the new and expanding phase in the growth of radical ideas and concepts, and their expression in literature, politics, music, art and social life.\"\n\nThe idea for an annual book fair was mooted in discussions after an event at the Commonwealth Institute in 1979 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding by Jessica Huntley and Eric Huntley of Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications; described as a \"cultural extravaganza\", it featured a variety of performers, poets, drummers, dancers and musicians, including Misty in Roots, Keith Waithe, Cecil Rajendra, Linton Kwesi Johnson and others. Its success demonstrated \"the potential for an event on this scale taking place in different parts of London and the UK on a regular basis\", and the suggestion of an annual book fair was later developed and eventually implemented. \n\nThe International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books was established by Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications, New Beacon Books and the Race Today collective in 1982, with the aim of being a \"meeting of the continents for writers, publishers, distributors, booksellers, artists, musicians, film makers, and the people who inspire and consume their creative productions\". The joint directors were John La Rose and Jessica Huntley until 1984, after which La Rose continued as sole director.\n\nThe first Book Fair was opened at Islington Town Hall on Thursday, 1 April 1982, by C. L. R. James (1982), and subsequent years saw other literary figures make the opening address, including Edward Kamau Brathwaite (1984), Wole Soyinka (1985),Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o (1987), Abdul Alkalimat (1988), Farrukh Dhondy (1989), Jayne Cortez (1990), John La Rose (1991), Margaret Busby (1993), and Pearl Connor (1995). \n\nThe book fair itself took place on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with cultural and political forums and other events in the preceding days of the week, and a closing concert on the following Sunday. The first Book Fair week in 1982 was attended by some 6,000 people. Topics covered in the forums included a discussion in 1982, with Jessica Huntley as presenter, on \"Racist and fascist attacks on Black, left-wing and community booksellers and other institutions in Britain\", or, in 1984, a forum entitled \"Migrant Struggles in Britain and Europe\", chaired by Darcus Howe.\n\nThose who attended the Book Fair came from the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Central America, the US, as well as the UK and other parts of Europe, not only to exhibit, order and distribute books but to take part in the accompanying programme of events that, alongside political discussion, showcased different cultural presentations including poetry and prose readings, drama, music and film. The many notable participants over the years included John Agard, Ama Ata Aidoo, Tariq Ali, May Ayim, Imruh Bakari, Biyi Bandele, Amiri Baraka, James Berry, Valerie Bloom, Jean Binta Breeze, Yvonne Brewster, Dennis Brutus, Robert Chrisman, Merle Collins, Carolyn Cooper, Fred D'Aguiar, Melvin Edwards, Nuruddin Farah, Edouard Glissant, Lorna Goodison, Roy A.

{"id": "1870664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870664", "title": "Interregnum (England)", "text": "Interregnum (England)\n\nThe Interregnum was the period between the execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649 and the arrival of his son Charles II in London on 29 May 1660 which marked the start of the Restoration. During the Interregnum England was under various forms of republican government (see Commonwealth of England; this article describes other facets of the Interregnum).\n\nThe politics of the period were dominated by the wishes of the \"Grandees\" (Senior Officers) of the New Model Army and their civilian supporters. They encouraged (or at least tolerated) several republican regimes.\n\nFrom 1649 until 1653 executive powers lay with Council of State, while legislative functions were carried out by the Rump Parliament.\n\nIn 1653 the Grandees, with Oliver Cromwell in the lead, dismissed the Rump, and replaced it with a Nominated Assembly (nicknamed the Parliament of Saints and Barebone's Parliament) made up of 140 nominees, 129 from England, five from Scotland and six from Ireland. It proved to be as difficult for the executive to work with this parliament as it had with the Rump, so, after sitting for five months, members friendly to the Grandees engendered its dissolution on 12 December 1653.\n\nThe \"Instrument of Government\" was adopted on 15 December 1653 and the pre-eminent \"Grandee\" Oliver Cromwell was installed as Lord Protector on the following day. The \"Instrument of Government\" granted executive power to the Lord Protector. Although this post was elective, not hereditary, it was to be held for life. It also required the calling of triennial Parliaments, with each sitting for at least five months.\n\nIn January 1655, Cromwell dissolved the first Protectorate Parliament, ushering in a period of military rule by the Major Generals.\n\nThe \"Instrument of Government\" was replaced in May 1657 by England's second, and last, codified constitution, the Humble Petition and Advice. However Oliver Cromwell died the next year and his nominated successor as Lord Protector, his son Richard, proved unable to govern effectively as various political parties strove to gain power.\n\nThe Protectorate came to an end in May 1659 when the Grandees recalled the Rump Parliament, which authorised a Committee of Safety to replace Richard's Council of State. This ushered in a period of unstable government, which did not come to an end until February 1660 when General George Monck, the English military governor of Scotland, marched to London at the head of his troops, and oversaw the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II.\n\nAfter the Parliamentarian victory in the Civil War, the Puritan views of the majority of Parliament and its supporters began to be imposed on the rest of the country. The Puritans advocated an austere lifestyle and restricted what they saw as the excesses of the previous regime. Most prominently, holidays such as Christmas and Easter were suppressed. Pastimes such as the theatre and gambling were also banned. However, some forms of art that were thought to be \"virtuous\", such as opera, were encouraged. These changes are often credited to Oliver Cromwell, though they were introduced by the Commonwealth Parliament; and Cromwell, when he came to power, was a liberalising influence.\n\nRabbi Menasseh Ben Israel met Oliver Cromwell in 1655 in order to discuss the admission of Jews into England. Cromwell did not agree to all the rights that Ben Israel requested, but the opening of Jewish synagogues and burial grounds was tolerated under Cromwell's Protectorate. The Jewish faith was still not practised openly in England, since Cromwell's move had been controversial and many in England were still hostile toward Jews. Life for Jews in England improved in that they could no longer be prosecuted if caught worshipping, yet discrimination continued.\n\nParliament had, to a large degree, encouraged the radical political groups which emerged when the usual social controls broke down during the English Civil War. It had also unwittingly established a new political force when it set up the New Model Army. Not surprisingly, all these groups had their own hopes for the new Commonwealth.\n\nLed by John Lilburne, Levellers drew their main support from London and the Army. In the Agreement of the People, 1649, they asked for a more representative and accountable parliament, to meet every two years; a reform of law so it would be available to and fair to all; and religious toleration. They wanted a more democratic society, although their proposed franchise did not extend to women or to the lowest orders of society.\n\nLevellers saw the Rump as little better than the monarchy it had replaced, and they showed their displeasure in demonstrations, pamphlets and mutinies. While their numbers did not pose a serious threat to the government, they scared the Rump into action and a Treasons Act was passed against them in 1649.\n\nLed by Gerrard Winstanley, Diggers wanted an even more equal society than the Levellers. They advocated a lifestyle that bore many similarities to later understandings of communism and anarchism, with communal ownership of land, and absolute equality for males and females in law and education. They existed in only very small numbers and faced a very strong opposition, even from the Levellers.\n\nThe breakdown of religious uniformity and incomplete Presbyterian Settlement of 1646 enabled independent churches to flourish. The main sects (\"see also English Dissenters\") were Baptists, who advocated adult rebaptism; Ranters, who claimed that sin did not exist for the \"chosen ones\"; and Fifth Monarchy Men, who opposed all \"earthly\" governments, believing they must prepare for God's kingdom on earth by establishing a \"government of saints\".\n\nDespite greater toleration, extreme sects were opposed by the upper classes as they were seen as a threat to social order and property rights.\nCatholics were also excluded from the toleration applied to the other groups.\n\nConservatives were still dominant in both central government and local government. In the former, the Rump was anxious not to offend the traditional ruling class whose support it needed for survival, so it opposed radical ideas. In the latter, that ruling class dominated through the influence of traditional regional gentry.\n\nThe Interregnum was a relatively short but important period in the history of the British Isles. It saw a number of political experiments without any stable form of government emerging, largely due to the wide diversity in religious and political groups that had been allowed to flourish after the regicide of Charles I.\n\nThe Puritan movement had evolved as a rejection of both real and perceived \"Catholicisation\" of the Church of England. When the Church of England was quickly disestablished by the Commonwealth Government, the question of what church to establish became a hotly debated subject. In the end, it was impossible to make all the political factions happy. During the Interregnum, Oliver Cromwell lost much of the support he had gained during the Civil War. Edward Sexby, previously a supporter of Cromwell's, felt disenfranchised by Cromwell's failure to abolish the aristocracy. In 1657, Silius Titus called for Cromwell's assassination in a co-authored pamphlet \"Killing No Murder\" under the pseudonym of William Allen. Sexby was captured when he returned to England and attempted to carry out the assassination described in Colonel Titus' book. Cromwell coerced Sexby into confessing authorship of the pamphlet and then imprisoned him in the Tower of London, where Sexby was driven to insanity, dying there less than a year later.\n\nHigh taxes required by the large standing army, kept due to the constant threats of Scottish and Irish rebellion, added to public resentment of Cromwell.\n"}

{"id": "594329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=594329", "title": "Line of battle", "text": "Line of battle\n\nIn naval warfare, the line of battle is a tactic in which a naval fleet of ships forms a line end to end. Its first use is disputed, variously claimed for dates ranging from 1502 to 1652, with line-of-battle tactics in widespread use by 1675.\n\nCompared with prior naval tactics, in which two opposing ships closed on one another for individual combat, the line of battle has the advantage that each ship in the line can fire its broadside without fear of hitting a friendly ship. Therefore, in a given period, the fleet can fire more shots.\n\nAnother advantage is that a relative movement of the line in relation to some part of the enemy fleet allows for a systematic concentration of fire on that part. The other fleet can avoid this by maneuvering in a line itself, with a result typical for sea battle since 1675: two fleets sail alongside one another or on the opposite tack.\n\nA ship powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be called a ship of the line (of battle) or line of battle ship, which was shortened to become the word \"battleship\".\n\nThe first recorded mention of the use of a line of battle tactic is attested from 1500. The \"Instructions\" provided in 1500 by King Manuel I of Portugal to the commander of a fleet dispatched to the Indian Ocean suggests its use predated the written instructions. Portuguese fleets overseas deployed in line ahead, firing one broadside and then putting about in order to return and discharge the other, resolving battles by gunnery alone. In a treatise of 1555, \"The Art of War at Sea\", Portuguese theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding, Fernão de Oliveira, recognized that at sea, the Portuguese \"fight at a distance, as if from walls and fortresses...\". He recommended the single line ahead as the ideal combat formation.\n\nA line-of-battle tactic had been used by the Fourth Portuguese India Armada in the Battle of Calicut, under Vasco da Gama in 1502, near Malabar against a Muslim fleet. One of the earliest recorded deliberate use is also documented in the First Battle of Cannanore between the Third Portuguese India Armada under João da Nova and the naval forces of Calicut, earlier in the same year. Another early, but different form of this strategy, was used in 1507 by Afonso de Albuquerque at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, in the first conquest of Ormuz. Albuquerque commanded a fleet of six carracks manned by 460 men, and entered Ormuz Bay, being surrounded by 250 warships and a 20.000 men army on land, Albuquerque made his small fleet (but powerful in its artillery) circle like a carrousel, but in a line end-to-end, and destroyed most of the ships that surrounded his squad. He then proceeded to capture Ormuz.\n\nWhile it is well documented that Maarten Tromp first used it in the Action of 18 September 1639, some have disputed this. One of the first precise written instructions in any language adopting the formation were contained in the English Navy's Fighting Instructions, written by Admiral Robert Blake and published in 1653. Individual captains on both sides of the First Anglo-Dutch War appear to have experimented with the technique in 1652, possibly including Blake at the Battle of Goodwin Sands.\n\nFrom the mid-16th century the cannon gradually became the most important weapon in naval warfare, replacing boarding actions as the decisive factor in combat. At the same time, the natural tendency in the design of galleons was for longer ships with lower castles, which meant faster, more stable vessels. These newer warships could mount more cannons along the sides of their decks, concentrating their firepower along their broadside.\n\nUntil the mid-17th century, the tactics of a fleet were often to \"charge\" the enemy, firing bow chaser cannon, which did not deploy the broadside to its best effect. These new vessels required new tactics, and \"since ... almost all the artillery is found upon the sides of a ship of war, hence it is the beam that must necessarily and always be turned toward the enemy. On the other hand, it is necessary that the sight of the latter must never be interrupted by a friendly ship. Only one formation allows the ships of the same fleet to satisfy fully these conditions. That formation is the line ahead [column]. This line, therefore, is imposed as the only order of battle, and consequently as the basis of all fleet tactics.\"\n\nThe line-of-battle tactic favored very large ships that could sail steadily and maintain their place in the line in the face of heavy fire. The change toward the line of battle also depended on an increased disciplining of society and the demands of powerful centralized government to keep permanent fleets led by a corps of professional officers. These officers were better able to manage and communicate between the ships they commanded than the merchant crews that often comprised large parts of a navy's force. The new type of warfare that developed during the early modern period was marked by a successively stricter organization. Battle formations became standardized, based on mathematically calculated ideal models. The increased power of states at the expense of individual landowners led to increasingly larger armies and navies.\n\nThe line of battle was marked by tactical ridigity and often resulted in indecisive engagements. Fleet commanders sometimes met with greater success by altering or abandoning the line of battle outright by breaking the enemy line and moving through it (e.g. Four Days Battle, Battle of Schooneveld, Battle of Trafalgar), by trying to cut off and isolate part of the enemy's line while concentrating a stronger force on it (e.g. Battle of Texel, Battle of the Saintes), or by trying to \"double up\" the enemy's ships (e.g. Battle of Beachy Head). \n\nThe main problem with the line of battle was that when the fleets are of similar size, naval actions using it were generally indecisive. The French in particular were adept at gunnery and would generally take the leeward position to enable their fleet to retire downwind while continuing to fire chain-shot at long range to bring down masts. Eventually so many vessels in a line would be damaged that they would be forced to retire for repairs while the French took few casualties and very little damage themselves. \n\nIf the opposing fleets were of similar size, a portion of the line might be overwhelmed by focused gunfire of the entire enemy line by doubling. Ships breaking through the enemy line would act in concert with others remaining on the original side to simultaneously engage both sides of a portion of the enemy fleet while the broadsides of the remainder of the enemy line were unable to engage.\n\nFor a period in the late 19th century, naval tactics became chaotic as ironclad warships were introduced. One school of thought held that ironclads were effectively invulnerable to gunfire, so ramming became a popular method of attack, such as at the Battle of Lissa and the Battle of the Yalu River. Another held that naval battles would only be decided by an assault on an enemy fleet in port. Ships built according to these doctrines tended to mount a handful of guns which could fire ahead or all-round, rather than broadside. The fleets of these periods tended to use the line of battle less.\n\nHowever, as ramming fell out of fashion, the logic of the line of battle returned; used in the Battle of Tsushima of 1905, the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and finally in the Battle of Surigao Strait in 1944.\n\nDuring World War II the development of aircraft carriers meant that gun engagements were no longer decisive. This meant there was no rationale for using a line-of-battle formation. In modern naval warfare, a battlegroup generally deploys with the highest-value units in the centre, accompanied closely by anti-aircraft escorts, with a number of anti-submarine escorts surrounding the formation at a distance of tens of miles.\n\n\n\n"}

A son of King George XII of Georgia, Bagrat occupied important administrative posts in the last years of the Georgian monarchy, after whose abolition by the Russian Empire in 1801 he entered the imperial civil service. He was known in Russia as the \"tsarevich\" Bagrat Georgievich Gruzinsky (). He is the author of works in the history of Georgia, veterinary medicine and economics. Bagrat is the forefather of the surviving descendants of the last kings of Georgia.\n\nBagrat was born in Tbilisi into the family of Crown Prince George, the future king George XII, and his first wife Ketevan née Andronikashvili. In 1790, Bagrat, then aged 14, received a princely domain in the Ksani valley after his reigning grandfather, Erekle II, dispossessed the defiant Kvenipneveli dynasty of the duchy of Ksani, dividing it into three parts. Other parts of the duchy were granted to Bagrat's elder brother Ioann and uncle Iulon. In addition, during the reign of his father George XII (1798–1801), Bagrat received Kakheti in possession. Around the same time, he became involved in a dynastic feud among the numerous posterity of Erekle II and George XII. In November 1800, Bagrat was one of the commanders of a combined Russo-Georgian force that defeated the joint invasion by the Avar khan Umma and Bagrat's own paternal half-uncle Alexander on the banks of the Iori in Kakheti.\n\nAfter George XII's death in 1800, the arrival of the Russian rule brought the Bagrationi rule to an end. The members of the Georgian royal family were deprived of their estates and deported to Russia proper. Unlike many of his royal relatives, Bagrat did not take arms against the Russian regime and, in 1803, accepted his exile in Moscow, which he left the day before the city's occupation by the French troops in 1812, and then in St. Petersburg, where he would live until his death. He was made a chamberlain of the Russian tsar Alexander I in 1818 and became a Privy Councillor and Senator of the empire in 1828.\n\nDuring his life in Russia, Bagrat composed a continuation of the Georgian history written by his brother David, covering the period from the middle of the 18th century to the 1840s. He also compiled a list of Georgians fighting in the Russian ranks against Napoleonic France in 1812. He also authored memoirs and the first Georgian-language book in veterinary medicine, published in St. Petersburg in 1818.\n\nPrince Bagrat was married to Princess Ekaterine [Ketevan] Cholokashvili (1781 – 30 June 1831), a daughter of Prince Durmishkhan Cholokashvili, sometime bailiff (\"mouravi\") of Pshavi and Khevsureti. She died of cholera in St. Petersburg and was buried at the Smolensky Cemetery. Bagrat and Ekaterina were the parents of ten children, of whom only three reached adulthood: \n\n"}

(The term \"reclaimed word\" more often implies usage by a member of the group that is referred.)\n\nThat can have wider implications in the fields of discourse and has been described in terms of personal or sociopolitical empowerment.\n\nReclaiming or reappropriating a word involves re-evaluating a term that is or was, in the dominant culture, used to by a majority to oppress various minorities of the same culture, such as \"queer\", once seen as pejorative but now reclaimed and used as a self-reference by some.\n\nReclaimed words differ from general reclamation outside of language because of their deliberately provocative nature. In addition to neutral or acceptable connotations, reclaimed words often acquire positive meaning within the circles of the informed. Outside the community, such transitions are rare. As such, the use of these terms by outside parties is usually viewed as strongly derogatory. For some terms, even \"reclaimed\" usage by members of the community concerned is a subject of controversy; for example, there is considerable debate within the transgender community over attempts to reclaim the term \"tranny\", usually applied offensively to trans women.\n\nThere are many recent English-language examples of some linguistic reappropriation in the areas of human sexuality, gender roles, sexual orientation, etc. Among these are:\n\n\nHowever, the phenomenon is much older, especially in politics and religion.\n\nIn England, for example, Cavalier was a derogatory nickname reappropriated as self-identification, while Roundhead, a Royalists derisory term for the supporters of the Parliamentary cause, is not (it was a punishable offence in the New Model Army to call a fellow soldier a roundhead). \"Tory\" (orig. from Middle Irish word for \"pursued man\" \"Tóraidhe\" ), \"Whig\" (from \"whiggamore\" (See the Whiggamore Raid)) and \"Suffragette\" are other British examples.\n\nIn the American colonies, British officers used Yankee, from a term used by the British to refer to Dutch pirates, as a derogatory term against colonists. British soldiers created the early versions of the song \"Yankee Doodle\", as a criticism of the uncultured colonists, but during the Revolution, as the colonists began to reappropriate the label \"yankee\" as a point of pride, they likewise reappropriated the song, altering verses, and turning it into a patriotic anthem.\n\nIn the 1850s in the United States, a secretive political party was derisively dubbed the Know Nothing party, based on their penchant for saying \"I know nothing\" when asked for details by outsiders; this became the common name for the party. It eventually became a popular name, sufficiently so that consumer products like tea, candy, and even a freighter were branded with the name.\n\nOne of the older examples of successful reclaiming is the term \"Jesuit\" to refer to members of the Society of Jesus. This was originally a derogatory term referring to people who too readily invoked the name of Jesus in their politics, but which members of the Society adopted over time for themselves, so that the word came to refer exclusively to them, and generally in a positive or neutral sense, even though the term \"Jesuitical\" is derived from the Society of Jesus and is used to mean things like: manipulative, conspiring, treacherous, capable of intellectually justifying anything by convoluted reasoning.\n\nAnother example can be found in the origins of Methodism; early members were originally mocked for their \"methodical\" and rule-driven religious devotion, founder John Wesley embraced the term for his movement.\n\nMembers of the Religious Society of Friends were termed \"Quakers\" as an epithet, but took up the term themselves.\n\nTo a lesser extent, and more controversially among the groups referred to, many racial, ethnic, and class terms have been reappropriated:\n\n\n\n\nMore generally, any kind of community can reappropriate words referring to them:\n\n"}
{"id": "22522610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22522610", "title": "Reception statute", "text": "Reception statute\n\nA reception statute is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent by which the new nation adopts, or receives, the English common law before its independence to the extent not explicitly rejected by the legislative body or constitution of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, as well as the precedents originating from it, as the default law because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state.\n\nAll US states have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the common law by judicial opinion, but there is a special case of partial reception for Louisiana.\n\nIn \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", Sir William Blackstone described the process by which English common law followed English colonization:\nPlantations or colonies, in distant countries, are either such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them desert and uncultivated, and peopling them from the mother-country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by conquest, or ceded to us by treaties. And both these rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at least upon that of nations. But there is a difference between these two species of colonies, with respect to the laws by which they are bound. For it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by English subjects, all the English laws then in being, which are the birthright of every subject, are immediately there in force... But in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the king may indeed alter and change those laws; but, till he does actually change them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unless such as are against the law of God, as in the case of an infidel country.\nIn other words, if an \"uninhabited\" or \"infidel\" territory is colonised by Britain, the English law automatically applies in the territory from the moment of colonisation, but if the colonised territory has a pre-existing legal system, the native law would apply (effectively, a form of indirect rule) until it is formally superseded by the English law by Royal Prerogative, subjected to the Westminster Parliament.\n\nAs colonies gained independence from Britain, the newly-independent countries usually adopted English common law precedent as of the date of independence as the default law to carry forward into the new nation, to the extent that was not explicitly rejected by the founding documents or government.\n\nIn some cases, the carry-forward was simply understood, with no express provision in either the new independence constitution or legislation. In other cases, the new legislature preferred to state redundantly but safely that common law had been received during the colonial period. Examples of both patterns are described below.\n\nAfter the 1776 American Revolution, one of the first legislative acts undertaken by each of the newly-independent states was to adopt a \"reception statute\" that gave legal effect to the existing body of English common law to the extent that the legislation or the constitution had not explicitly rejected English law. Some states enacted reception statutes as legislative statutes, but other states received the English common law by provisions of their constitution or by court decision. British traditions such as the monarchy were rejected by the US Constitution, but many English common law traditions such as habeas corpus, jury trials, and various other civil liberties were adopted in the United States. Significant elements of English common law prior to 1776 still remain in effect in many jurisdictions in the United States because they have never been rejected by American courts or legislatures.\n\nFor example, the New York Constitution of 1777 provides that:\nAlexander Hamilton emphasized in the Federalist Papers that the New York constitutional provision expressly made the common law subject \"to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same.\" Thus, even when reception was effected by a constitution, the common law was still subject to alteration by a legislature's statute.\n\nThe Northwest Ordinance, which was approved by the Congress of the Confederation in 1787, guaranteed \"judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law.\" Nathan Dane, the primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, viewed that provision as a default mechanism if federal or territorial statutes were silent about a particular matter. Hr wrote that if \"a statute makes an offence, and is silent as to the mode of trial, it shall be by jury, according to the course of the common law.\" In effect, the provision operated as a reception statute, giving legal authority to the established common law in the vast territories in which no states had yet been established.\n\nOver time, as new states were formed from federal territories, the territorial reception statutes became obsolete and were re-enacted as state law. For example, a reception statute enacted by legislation in the state of Washington states, \"The common law, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or of the state of Washington nor incompatible with the institutions and condition of society in this state, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of this state.\" In that way, the common law was eventually incorporated into the legal systems of every state (except for the law of Louisiana for which some areas of law were received as common law and others were adopted from French and Spanish sources).\n\nCertain anomalies exist within certain US states because of the effective branching of the law in different directions. For example, the Commonwealth of Virginia adopted the English common law upon becoming independent but before England abolished trial by combat. Thus, it has been argued that the right to request trial by combat theoretically still exists in Virginia, at least as far as a form of action under which the common law had authorized trial by combat would be available in Virginia.\n\nThe Canadian colonies received the common law and English statutes under Blackstone's principles for the establishment of the legal system of a new colony. In five of the ten Canadian provinces, English law was received automatically, under the principle of a settled colony inheriting English law. In the other provinces and in the three territories, reception was governed by reception statutes. The reception of English law occurred long before Canada became fully independent and so reception statutes in Canada were not part of the decolonisation process.\n\nWhen Canada achieved formal independence with the passage of the Canada Act 1982, no reception statutes were necessary for the decolonialisation process. English law had already been received in all the various Canadian provinces and territories by legislation and judicial decisions over the previous two centuries.\n\nIn the four Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador), the reception of English law was automatic, under the principle set out by Blackstone relating to settled colonies. British colonists were considered to have brought English common law and the applicable English statutes with them and so no reception statute was necessary.\n\nThe reception date for New Brunswick is 1660, for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island 1758, and for Newfoundland and Labrador 1825.\n\nQuebec was settled as a French colony and originally operated under the French civil law system by using the \"Coûtume de Paris\". Upon the transfer of the colony to British control, the British government issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which imposed English common law on the colony under the principle set out in Blackstone relating to captured colonies. However, in 1774, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act, which restored the French civil law for matters of private law (matters such as contracts, property, and successions (wills)) but kept the English common law as the basis for public law in the colony, notably the criminal law.\n\nWith the passage of the Civil Code of Lower Canada in 1866, Quebec's civil law became entirely statute-based and used the civil law system for matters within provincial jurisdiction.\n\nPublic law in Quebec continues to have its origin in the common law, but even then, civil law plays a strong role. If federal legislation requires interpretation, judges must look to the Civil Code of Quebec.\n\nThe territory now forming Ontario was originally part of Quebec and so was under the civil law. When Quebec was divided into the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada by the Constitutional Act of 1791, the first Act passed by the Legislature of Upper Canada was to adopt the law of England for all purposes, replacing the civil law. That statute adopted both the English common law and English statute law. The foundation for the operation of the common law in Ontario traces back to that reception statute.\n\nThe new Dominion of Canada acquired the territories of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1870. Those territories were considered to have been settled by British colonists and so the reception of English law was automatic. However, the long history of control by the Hudson's Bay Company caused some uncertainty as to the date of reception. To resolve the uncertainty, various statutes were passed to set the date of reception to July 15, 1870, the date of the transfer of those two territories to Canada. The Province of Manitoba set that date for the reception of English law for matters coming within provincial jurisdiction. The Legislature of the North-West Territories passed an ordinance, adopting the same date for matters coming within territorial jurisdiction.\n\nThe federal Parliament eventually enacted a provision adopting that date for all matters in the North-West Territories. That provision was carried forward in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan when they were created by the Alberta Act and the Saskatchewan Act. The same provision is the basis for the reception date of English law in the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut.\n\nBritish Columbia was considered to be a settled colony and so received English law automatically, under the principle set out by Blackstone.\n\nHong Kong was ceded (in case of the New Territories, leased) to the United Kingdom by Qing dynasty of China by a series of treaties, starting with the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As a ceded or leased territory with its own set of laws, the Great Qing Legal Code remained in force for the local Chinese population. Until the late 19th century, a Chinese man convicted of murder would be executed by decapitation, but an Englishman convicted of the same crime would be sentenced to death by hanging. It was not until 1971, nearly six decades after the fall of the Qing dynasty, that the of the Qing Code was completely abolished in Hong Kong. Even then, some vestiges of it remain. For example, before the Marriage Reform Ordinance 1970 (Cap. 178) came into force on 7 October 1971, a man could practice polygamy by virtue of the Qing Code. The courts still refer to the Qing Code on the inheritance rights of surviving concubines married before 1971 and that of their children.\n\nWhen Hong Kong was handed over to the People's Republic of China in 1997, Hong Kong retained the common law in a reception statute in Chapter I, Article 8, of the Hong Kong Basic Law:\n\nThe 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State stated that pre-existing laws would remain in force except if repugnant to it, and the 1937 Constitution of Ireland does likewise. Neither explicitly stated whether that meant only the statute law or, more broadly, the common law and equity as well. The Supreme Court has generally taken the broader view.\n\nThe pattern was repeated in many other former British colonies as they gained independence from the United Kingdom. New Zealand, India, Belize and various Caribbean and African nations have adopted English common law by reception statutes although they do not inevitably continue to copy English common law; later cases can often draw on decisions in other common law jurisdictions. The colony of New South Wales formally received the English common law in 1828, and each of the other Australian colonies received the common law of New South Wales upon its founding.\n\n"}

This was commonly done in the past. However, in the late 20th century a separate concept of conservation-restoration was developed that is more concerned with preserving the work of art for the future, and less with making it look pristine. Restoration is controversial, since it often involves some irreversible change to the original material of the artwork with the goal of making it \"look good.\" The attitude that has developed in recent years with the development of conservation is to attempt to make all restoration reversible.\n\nArt conservation can involve the cleaning and stabilization of art work. Ideally, any process used is reversible, departures from that ideal not being undertaken lightly. Cleaning is not a reversible process and can sometimes be controversial due to fears that cleaning would damage a piece, or on the grounds that damage or residue forms part of the history of a given piece and should not be modified. Michelangelo's statue of David has undergone two cleanings to remove dirt that had accumulated on the statue's surface.\n\nArt restoration is vital to the survival of classical paintings and is part of the scientific application of chemistry. It often involves research to determine the original colors and materials of a work.\n\nThe use of watercolor paints to inpaint damages on fresco is an example of a technique utilized to achieve almost complete reversibility. This is the technique used in the 20 year restoration of Da Vinci's \"The Last Supper\" in Milan. One of the most popular inpainting techniques used today is the Tinted Varnish Treatment. This process is done once the piece is fully cleaned and varnished. This last step in the restoration process is to then go into spots where original paint may be missing, or where patched holes and other irregularities may lie. The restorer then goes in with tinted varnish over the top of the non-tinted varnish. This gives the illusion that the spots have been \"re-painted\", while in fact it is just a spot of tinted varnish. Most commonly \"stippling\" is used while using tinted varnish, in order for light to reflect similar to paint. This is done by using tiny dots in a row for variance.\n\nIn 2014, Harvard Art Museums exhibited murals by Mark Rothko from 1961 and 1962 which had faded due to their original display in a dining room.

{"id": "10350225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10350225", "title": "Stille Hilfe", "text": "Stille Hilfe\n\nDie Stille Hilfe für Kriegsgefangene und Internierte (English: \"Silent assistance for prisoners of war and interned persons\"), abbreviated Stille Hilfe, is a relief organization for arrested, condemned and fugitive SS members, similar to the veterans' association HIAG, set up by Helene Elisabeth Princess von Isenburg (1900–1974) in 1951. The organisation has come under criticism for its encouragement and support of Neo-Nazis. The organization has garnered a reputation for being shrouded in secrecy and thus remains a source of speculation.\n\nOperating covertly since 1946, the organization that later became publicly active as \"Stille Hilfe\", aided the escape of hunted Nazi fugitives, particularly to South America. Thus Adolf Eichmann, Johann von Leers, Walter Rauff and Josef Mengele could escape to Argentina.\n\nAfter the main exponents of the later association had already long formed an active network, it was decided a non-profit association should be formed primarily to facilitate a donations campaign. On 7 October 1951 the founders' meeting was held in Munich and on 15 November 1951 the organization was entered in the register of associations in the Upper Bavarian city Wolfratshausen. The first president, Helene Elizabeth, Princess von Isenburg was chosen because of her good contacts in the aristocracy and conservative upper middle-class circles as well as the Catholic Church. Founding members of the committee included church representatives Theophil Worm and Johannes Neuhäusler, as well as high-ranking former functionaries of the Nazi state such as the former \"SS-Standartenführer\" and head of department in the Central Reich Security Office (RSHA), Wilhelm Spengler, and SS-Obersturmbannführer Heinrich Malz, who was the personal adviser of Ernst Kaltenbrunner.\n\nHelene Elisabeth, Princess von Isenburg explained its objectives in this way: \"From the start of its efforts‚ the Stille Hilfe sought to take care of, above all, the serious needs of the prisoners of war and those interned completely without rights. Later their welfare service was active for those accused and arrested as a result of the war trials, whether in the prisons of the victors or in German penal institutions\".\n\nFrom the beginning of the Nuremberg Trials, the group sought to influence public opinion to prevent the death penalty. In press campaigns, personal and open letters and petitions, the war criminals were usually represented as innocent victims–pure command-receivers, irreproachable and often also having a blind faith in the Führer–who would have to suffer bitter injustice by victor's justice.\n\nBecause Princess von Isenburg was particularly devoted to the war criminals condemned to death in Landsberg prison, she was affectionately known as \"Mother of the Landsbergers\" in order to let \"Stille Hilfe\" be seen primarily as a charitable organisation.\n\nThe legal assistance for arrested war criminals was first organised by the attorney Rudolf Aschenauer (1913–1983), who also formulated and submitted requests for grace and revisions. The organisation paid vacation, dismissal and Christmas benefit to the prisoners and also supported their families. They were not only limited to humanitarian activities but also pursued a past-ideological and revisionist objective.\n\nPrincess Isenburg, a strict Catholic, tirelessly pleaded the criminals' cause in conservative circles and with high-ranking church representatives (even up to the Pope). Johannes Neuhäusler (1888–1973) in particular, who not only had suffered detention/imprisonment by the Gestapo, but also had been held by the Nazis in the Dachau concentration camp as a special prisoner, was most effective in public opinion, even among western Allied officials. The motives of the bishops lay probably less in a conscious ideological identification with the war criminals, but rather in the effort regarding reconciliation with the German past and the start of the new post-war society in West Germany. Neuhäusler explained that he wanted to repay \"the bad with good\". The further connections of Princess Isenburg and Aschenauer led particularly to former SS organisations such as Gauleiterkreis under Werner Naumann, which was already partly formed in Allied prisoner-of-war camps. Princess Isenburg initiated a whole series of organisations as \"The working group for the rescue of the Landsberger prisoners\", who were essentially financed by the churches.\n\nThe churches to a large extent withdrew support with the end of the main Nuremberg Trials and the release of the time-serving Nazi war criminals from Landsberg prison in 1958.\n\nIn the following decades Stille Hilfe worked somewhat in secret with revisionist organizations and prominent protagonists of the \"Auschwitzlüge\" (Auschwitz lie) like Thies Christophersen and Manfred Roeder and co-operated with relevant foreign organizations and personalities e.g. (Florentine Rost van Tonningen, Léon Degrelle). By a not insignificant number of inheritances and by regular donations, the organization controls considerable funds. Since Stille Hilfe does not publish end-of-year figures, one can only estimate the influx of capital; however, perhaps donations (not including inheritances) were annually circa €60,000 to €80,000, at least to the end of the 1990s.\n\nStille Hilfe supported the condemned in the Düsseldorfer Majdanek trials, the former concentration camp guard Hildegard Lächert (\"bloody Brygida\") and later Klaus Barbie, Erich Priebke and Josef Schwammberger, who from 1942 to 1944 was commander of German labour camps in occupied Poland, involved in the massacres of Przemyśl and Rozwadów. Whether they were involved in the release of Herbert Kappler from a prison in Rome in 1977 is not clarified. Chairmen after Princess Isenburg (until 1959) were to 1992 the former Bund Deutscher Mädel leaders Gertrude Herr and Adelheid Klug.\n\nThey have been led since 1992 by Horst Janzen. The organisation today has approximately 40 members with decreasing numbers. At the same time however contacts were reinforced with \"Hilfsorganisation für nationale politische Gefangene und deren Angehörige\" (relief organization for national political prisoners) (HNG), so continuity may be secured.\n\nBased until 1976 in Bremen Osterholz, since 1989 in Rotenburg an der Wümme, since 1992 in Wuppertal. In 1993–94 it caused a political debate in the Bundestag over its non-profit status as a revisionistic right-wing extremist association and was submitted to an examination by the fiscal authorities. In the Bundesfinanzhof (Federal Finance Court) it was decided in November 1999 to deny Stille Hilfe non-profit, i.e. charitable, status.\n\nFor years they had a prominent symbol: Gudrun Burwitz, the daughter of Heinrich Himmler. Known to her father as \"Püppi\", she was an idol to Stille Hilfe and their affiliates. At meetings such as Ulrichsbergtreffen in Austria she appeared at the same time as a star and an authority. Burwitz campaigned intensively in the last few years for accused Nazis. This particularly showed up in the case of Anton Malloth, who had lived undisturbed for about 40 years in Meran. He was proven guilty for his acts as a supervisor in the Gestapo-prison \"Kleine Festung Theresienstadt\", which was part of the larger Theresienstadt concentration camp. In 2001 Malloth was convicted by the district court of Munich for murder and attempted murder and sentenced to life imprisonment after the public prosecutor's office in Munich had taken over the procedure of the public prosecutor's office in Dortmund, which for many years had hijacked the procedure. From 1988 to 2000, Malloth lived in Pullach near Munich. Gudrun Burwitz was instructed by Stille Hilfe to rent a comfortable room for him in a home for the aged, which was built on a lot formerly owned by Rudolf Hess. In common with the secretive nature of the organisation, Burwitz did not give press interviews.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s it became public that the social welfare assistance administration (and thus the German taxpayers) had in large part taken over the considerable running costs of the home where Malloth was staying. This, along with the participation of Gudrun Burwitz, resulted in substantial public criticism.\n\nAlthough firmly rooted in the neo-Nazi fringe, it developed amicable relations with conservative West German politicians, such as CDU Bundestag Parliamentary leader Alfred Dregger, who praised the efforts of Stille Hilfe in 1989.\n\nIn 1991, a Stille Hilfe representative attended the graveside ceremony in Kassel of Michael Kühnen, the prominent Neo-Nazi leader who died of HIV-related complications. Stille Hilfe laid a wreath that bore the SS motto \"Michael Kühnen – his honour is loyalty.\"\n\nThe organisation has come under criticism for its encouragement and support of neo-Nazis. This has included legal aid for those facing prosecution. It also supports a Protestant old people's home in Pullach, near Munich.\n\n"}
{"id": "19224834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19224834", "title": "Stoicism", "text": "Stoicism\n\nStoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. While Stoic physics are largely drawn from the teachings of the philosopher Heraclitus, they are heavily influenced by certain teachings of Socrates. Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.\n\nThe Stoics are especially known for teaching that \"virtue is the only good\" for human beings, and that external things—such as health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good or bad in themselves, but have value as \"material for virtue to act upon\". Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to Western virtue ethics. The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called \"prohairesis\") that is \"in accord with nature\". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said, but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.\n\nMany Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus—emphasized that because \"virtue is sufficient for happiness\", a sage would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase \"stoic calm\", though the phrase does not include the \"radical ethical\" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious. \n\nStoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism).\n\nStoic comes from the Greek \"stōïkos\", meaning \"of the stoa [portico, or porch]\". This, in turn, refers to the Stoa Poikile, or \"Painted Stoa,\" in Athens, where the influential Stoic Zeno of Citium taught. In laymen's terms stoicism is sometimes referred to as \"suffering in silence\", and the ethics associated with that.\n\nThe Stoics provided a unified account of the world, consisting of formal logic, monistic physics and naturalistic ethics. Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.\n\nStoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (\"logos\"). A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: \"\"Virtue\" consists in a \"will\" that is in agreement with Nature.\" This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; \"to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy,\" and to accept even slaves as \"equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature\".\n\nThe Stoic ethic espouses a deterministic perspective; in regard to those who lack Stoic virtue, Cleanthes once opined that the wicked man is \"like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever it goes\". A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus, \"sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,\" thus positing a \"completely autonomous\" individual will, and at the same time a universe that is \"a rigidly deterministic single whole\". This viewpoint was later described as \"Classical Pantheism\" (and was adopted by Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza).\n\nStoicism became the foremost popular philosophy among the educated elite in the Hellenistic world and the Roman Empire, to the point where, in the words of Gilbert Murray \"nearly all the successors of Alexander [...] professed themselves Stoics.\"\n\nBeginning around 301 BC, Zeno taught philosophy at the Stoa Poikile (\"Painted Porch\"), from which his philosophy got its name. Unlike the other schools of philosophy, such as the Epicureans, Zeno chose to teach his philosophy in a public space, which was a colonnade overlooking the central gathering place of Athens, the Agora.\n\nZeno's ideas developed from those of the Cynics, whose founding father, Antisthenes, had been a disciple of Socrates. Zeno's most influential follower was Chrysippus, who was responsible for the molding of what is now called Stoicism. Later Roman Stoics focused on promoting a life in harmony within the universe, over which one has no direct control.\nScholars usually divide the history of Stoicism into three phases:\n\nNo complete work by any Stoic philosopher survives from the first two phases of Stoicism. Only Roman texts from the Late Stoa survive.\n\nDiodorus Cronus, who was one of Zeno's teachers, is considered the philosopher who first introduced and developed an approach to logic now known as propositional logic, which is based on statements or propositions, rather than terms, making it very different from Aristotle's term logic. Later, Chrysippus developed a system that became known as Stoic logic and included a deductive system, Stoic Syllogistic, which was considered a rival to Aristotle's Syllogistic (see Syllogism). New interest in Stoic logic came in the 20th century, when important developments in logic were based on propositional logic. Susanne Bobzien wrote, \"The many close similarities between Chrysippus' philosophical logic and that of Gottlob Frege are especially striking.\"\n\nBobzien also notes that \"Chrysippus wrote over 300 books on logic, on virtually any topic logic today concerns itself with, including speech act theory, sentence analysis, singular and plural expressions, types of predicates, indexicals, existential propositions, sentential connectives, negations, disjunctions, conditionals, logical consequence, valid argument forms, theory of deduction, propositional logic, modal logic, tense logic, epistemic logic, logic of suppositions, logic of imperatives, ambiguity and logical paradoxes.\"\n\nThe Stoics held that all being (ὄντα) – though not all things (τινά) – is material. They accepted the distinction between Abstract and concrete bodies, but rejected Aristotle's belief that purely incorporeal being exists. Thus, they accepted Anaxagoras' idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all accidents. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.\n\nThey held that there were four categories.\n\nThe Stoics propounded that knowledge can be attained through the use of reason. Truth can be distinguished from fallacy—even if, in practice, only an approximation can be made. According to the Stoics, the senses constantly receive sensations: pulsations that pass from objects through the senses to the mind, where they leave an impression in the imagination (phantasia) (an impression arising from the mind was called a phantasma).\n\nThe mind has the ability to judge (συγκατάθεσις, \"synkatathesis\")—approve or reject—an impression, enabling it to distinguish a true representation of reality from one that is false. Some impressions can be assented to immediately, but others can only achieve varying degrees of hesitant approval, which can be labeled belief or opinion (\"doxa\"). It is only through reason that we gain clear comprehension and conviction (\"katalepsis\"). Certain and true knowledge (\"episteme\"), achievable by the Stoic sage, can be attained only by verifying the conviction with the expertise of one's peers and the collective judgment of humankind.\n\nThe first philosophers to explicitly describe nominalist arguments were the Stoics, especially Chrysippus.\n\nAccording to the Stoics, the Universe is a material, reasoning substance, known as God or Nature, which the Stoics divided into two classes, the active and the passive. The passive substance is matter, which \"lies sluggish, a substance ready for any use, but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion\". The active substance, which can be called Fate or Universal Reason (\"Logos\"), is an intelligent aether or primordial fire, which acts on the passive matter:\nEverything is subject to the laws of Fate, for the Universe acts according to its own nature, and the nature of the passive matter it governs. The souls of humans and animals are emanations from this primordial Fire, and are, likewise, subject to Fate:\n\nIndividual souls are perishable by nature, and can be \"transmuted and diffused, assuming a fiery nature by being received into the \"seminal reason\" (\"logos spermatikos\") of the Universe\". Since right Reason is the foundation of both humanity and the universe, it follows that the goal of life is to live according to Reason, that is, to live a life according to Nature.\n\nStoic theology is a fatalistic and naturalistic pantheism: God is never fully transcendent but always immanent, and identified with Nature. Abrahamic religions personalize God as a world-creating entity, but Stoicism equates God with the totality of the universe; according to Stoic cosmology, which is very similar to the Hindu conception of existence, there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic. Similarly, the space and Universe have neither start nor end, rather they are cyclical. The current Universe is a phase in the present cycle, preceded by an infinite number of Universes, doomed to be destroyed (\"ekpyrōsis\", \"conflagration\") and re-created again, and to be followed by another infinite number of Universes. Stoicism considers all existence as cyclic, the cosmos as eternally self-creating and self-destroying (see also Eternal return).\n\nStoicism, just like Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, does not posit a beginning or end to the Universe. According to the Stoics, the \"logos\" was the active reason or \"anima mundi\" pervading and animating the entire Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the \"seminal reason\" (\"logos spermatikos\"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate matter. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine \"logos\", which is the primordial Fire and reason that controls and sustains the Universe.\n\nThe ancient Stoics are often misunderstood because the terms they used pertained to different concepts in the past than they do today. The word \"stoic\" has come to mean \"unemotional\" or indifferent to pain because Stoic ethics taught freedom from \"passion\" by following \"reason\". The Stoics did not seek to extinguish emotions; rather, they sought to transform them by a resolute \"askēsis\" that enables a person to develop clear judgment and inner calm. Logic, reflection, and concentration were the methods of such self-discipline.\n\nBorrowing from the Cynics, the foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself; in wisdom and self-control. Stoic ethics stressed the rule: \"Follow where reason leads.\" One must therefore strive to be free of the passions, bearing in mind that the ancient meaning of \"passion\" was \"anguish\" or \"suffering\", that is, \"passively\" reacting to external events, which is somewhat different from the modern use of the word. A distinction was made between \"pathos\" (plural \"pathe\") which is normally translated as \"passion\", \"propathos\" or instinctive reaction (e.g., turning pale and trembling when confronted by physical danger) and \"eupathos\", which is the mark of the Stoic sage (\"sophos\"). The \"eupatheia\" are feelings that result from correct judgment in the same way that passions result from incorrect judgment.\n\nThe idea was to be free of suffering through \"apatheia\" (Greek: ; literally, \"without passion\") or peace of mind, where peace of mind was understood in the ancient sense—being objective or having \"clear judgment\" and the maintenance of equanimity in the face of life's highs and lows.\n\nFor the Stoics, reason meant not only using logic, but also understanding the processes of nature—the logos or universal reason, inherent in all things. Living according to reason and virtue, they held, is to live in harmony with the divine order of the universe, in recognition of the common reason and essential value of all people.\n\nThe four cardinal virtues (\"aretai\") of Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the teachings of Plato (\"Republic\" IV. 426–435):\n\nFollowing Socrates, the Stoics held that unhappiness and evil are the results of human ignorance of the reason in nature. If someone is unkind, it is because they are unaware of their own universal reason, which leads to the conclusion of unkindness. The solution to evil and unhappiness then is the practice of Stoic philosophy: to examine one's own judgments and behavior and determine where they diverge from the universal reason of nature.\n\nThe Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life. Plutarch held that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised Cato's self-consistency (\"constantia\") as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices. Suicide could be justified if one fell victim to severe pain or disease, but otherwise suicide would usually be seen as a rejection of one's social duty.\n\nIn philosophical terms, things that are indifferent are outside the application of moral law—that is without tendency to either promote or obstruct moral ends. Actions neither required nor forbidden by the moral law, or that do not affect morality, are called morally indifferent. The doctrine of things indifferent (, \"adiaphora\") arose in the Stoic school as a corollary of its diametric opposition of virtue and vice ( \"kathekon\", \"convenient actions\", or actions in accordance with nature; and ἁμαρτήματα \"hamartemata\", mistakes). As a result of this dichotomy, a large class of objects were left unassigned and thus regarded as indifferent.\n\nEventually three sub-classes of \"things indifferent\" developed: things to prefer because they assist life according to nature; things to avoid because they hinder it; and things indifferent in the narrower sense. The principle of \"adiaphora\" was also common to the Cynics. Philipp Melanchthon revived the doctrine of things indifferent during the Renaissance.\n\nPhilosophy for a Stoic is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims, it is a way of life involving constant practice and training (or \"askēsis\"). Stoic philosophical and spiritual practices included logic, Socratic dialogue and self-dialogue, contemplation of death, training attention to remain in the present moment (similar to some forms of Buddhist meditation), and daily reflection on everyday problems and possible solutions. Philosophy for a Stoic is an active process of constant practice and self-reminder.\n\nIn his \"Meditations\", Marcus Aurelius defines several such practices. For example, in Book II.I:\n\nSay to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of the ignorance of real good and ill... I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together...\n\nPrior to Aurelius, Epictetus in his \"Discourses,\" distinguished between three types of act: judgment, desire, and inclination. According to French philosopher Pierre Hadot, Epictetus identifies these three acts with logic, physics and ethics respectively. Hadot writes that in the \"Meditations\", \"Each maxim develops either one of these very characteristic \"topoi\" [i.e., acts], or two of them or three of them.\"\n\nSeamus Mac Suibhne has described the practices of spiritual exercises as influencing those of reflective practice. Robertson's \"The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy\" details at length parallels between Stoic spiritual exercises and modern cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nStoics were also known for consolatory orations, which were part of the \"consolatio\" literary tradition. Three such consolations by Seneca have survived.\n\nA distinctive feature of Stoicism is its cosmopolitanism: All people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should live in brotherly love and readily help one another according to the Stoics. In the \"Discourses\", Epictetus comments on man's relationship with the world: \"Each human being is primarily a citizen of his own commonwealth; but he is also a member of the great city of gods and men, whereof the city political is only a copy.\" This sentiment echoes that of Diogenes of Sinope, who said, \"I am not an Athenian or a Corinthian, but a citizen of the world.\"\n\nThey held that external differences such as rank and wealth are of no importance in social relationships. Instead, they advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings. Stoicism became the most influential school of the Greco-Roman world, and produced a number of remarkable writers and personalities, such as Cato the Younger and Epictetus.\n\nIn particular, they were noted for their urging of clemency toward slaves. Seneca exhorted, \"Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies.\"\n\nIn his introduction to the 1964 Penguin Classics edition of \"Meditations\", the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact Stoicism had on Christianity. He claimed the author of the Fourth Gospel declared Christ to be the Logos, which \"had long been one of the leading terms of Stoicism, chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe\". In St. Ambrose of Milan's \"Duties\", \"The voice is the voice of a Christian bishop, but the precepts are those of Zeno.\" Regarding what he called \"the Divine Spirit\", Stanisforth wrote:\nCleanthes, wishing to give more explicit meaning to Zeno's 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term \"pneuma\", or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated—in the Christian as in the Stoic mind—with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.\n\nRegarding the Trinity, Staniforth wrote:\nAgain in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the Divine Unity. Thus Seneca, writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.\n\nThe apostle Paul met with Stoics during his stay in Athens, reported in . In his letters, Paul reflected heavily from his knowledge of Stoic philosophy, using Stoic terms and metaphors to assist his new Gentile converts in their understanding of Christianity. Stoic influence can also be seen in the works of St. Ambrose, Marcus Minucius Felix, and Tertullian.\n\nThe Fathers of the Church regarded Stoicism as a \"pagan philosophy\"; nonetheless, early Christian writers employed some of the central philosophical concepts of Stoicism. Examples include the terms \"logos\", \"virtue\", \"Spirit\", and \"conscience\". But the parallels go well beyond the sharing and borrowing of terminology. Both Stoicism and Christianity assert an inner freedom in the face of the external world, a belief in human kinship with Nature or God, a sense of the innate depravity—or \"persistent evil\"—of humankind, and the futility and temporary nature of worldly possessions and attachments. Both encourage \"Ascesis\" with respect to the passions and inferior emotions such as lust, and envy, so that the higher possibilities of one's humanity can be awakened and developed.\n\nStoic writings such as \"Meditations\" by Marcus Aurelius have been highly regarded by many Christians throughout the centuries. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Church accept the Stoic ideal of dispassion to this day.\n\nMiddle and Roman Stoics taught that sex is just within marriage, for unitive and procreative purposes only. This teaching is accepted by the Catholic Church to this day.\n\nSaint Ambrose of Milan was known for applying Stoic philosophy to his theology.\n\nThe word \"stoic\" commonly refers to someone indifferent to pain, pleasure, grief, or joy. The modern usage as \"person who represses feelings or endures patiently\" was first cited in 1579 as a noun, and 1596 as an adjective. In contrast to the term \"Epicurean\", the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's\" entry on Stoicism notes, \"the sense of the English adjective 'stoical' is not utterly misleading with regard to its philosophical origins.\"\n\n\n\n"}

However, unlike the coronet or helmet and crest, supporters were not part of early medieval heraldry. As part of the heraldic achievement, they first become fashionable towards the end of the 15th century, but even in the 17th century were not necessarily part of the full heraldic achievement (being absent, for example, in \"Siebmachers Wappenbuch\" of 1605).\n\nThe figures used as supporters may be based on real or imaginary animals, human figures, and in rare cases plants or other inanimate objects, such as the pillars of Hercules of the coat of arms of Spain. Often, as in other elements of heraldry, these can have local significance, such as the fisherman and the tin miner granted to Cornwall County Council, or a historical link; such as the lion of England and unicorn of Scotland in the two variations of the Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom. The arms of nutritionist John Boyd-Orr use two 'garbs' (wheat sheaves) as supporters; the arms of , missiles; the arms of the state of Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil, trees. Letters of the alphabet are used as supporters in the arms of Valencia, Spain. Human supporters can also be allegorical figures, or, more rarely, specifically named individuals.\n\nThere is usually one supporter on each side of the shield, though there are some examples of single supporters placed behind the shield, such as the imperial eagle of the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire. The arms of the Congo provide an extremely unusual example of two supporters issuing from behind the shield. While such single supporters are generally eagles with one or two heads, there are other examples, including the cathedra in the case of some Canadian cathedrals. At the other extreme and even rarer, the Scottish chief Dundas of that Ilk had three supporters: two conventional red lions and the whole supported by a salamander. The coat of arms of Iceland even has four supporters.\n\nThe context of the application of supporters may vary, although entitlement may be considered conditioned by grant of a type of augmentation of honour by admission in orders of chivalry or by heraldic authorities, such as in the case of traditional British heraldry.\n\nAnimal supporters are, by default, as close to rampant as possible, if the nature of the supporter allows it (this does not need to be mentioned in the blazon), though there are some blazoned exceptions. An example of whales 'non-rampant' is the arms of the Dutch municipality of Zaanstad.\n\nOlder writers trace origins of supporters to their usages in tournaments, where the shields of the combatants were exposed for inspection, and guarded by their servants or pages disguised in fanciful attire. However, medieval Scottish seals afford numerous examples in which the 13th and 14th century shields were placed between two creatures resembling lizards or dragons. Also, the seal of John, Duke of Normandy, eldest son of the King of France, before 1316 bears his arms as; France ancient, a bordure \"gules\", between two lions rampant away from the shield, and an eagle with expanded wings standing above it. \n\nIn Canada, Companions of the Order of Canada, Commanders of the Order of Military Merit, Commanders of the Royal Victorian Order: people granted the style the Right Honourable, and corporations are granted the use of supporters on their coats of arms. Further, on his retirement from office as Chief Herald, Robert Watt was granted supporters as an honour.\n\nIn France, writers made a distinctive difference on the subject of supporters, giving the name of \"Supports\" to animals, real or imaginary, thus employed; while human figures or angels similarly used are called \"Tenants\" (i.e. 'holders'). Trees and other inanimate objects which are sometimes used are called \"Soutiens\". \n\nKnights Grand Companion and Principal Companions of the New Zealand Order of Merit are granted the use of heraldic supporters.\n\nOriginally, in England, supporters were regarded as little more than mere decorative and artistic appendages.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, supporters are typically an example of special royal favour, granted at the behest of the sovereign. Hereditary supporters are normally limited to hereditary peers, certain members of the Royal Family, and to some chiefs of Scottish clans. Non-hereditary supporters are granted to life peers, Knights and Ladies of the Order of the Garter and Order of the Thistle, Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, Order of St Michael and St George, Royal Victorian Order and Order of the British Empire, and Bailiffs and Dames Grand Cross of the Order of St John. Knights banneret were also granted non-hereditary supporters, but no such knight has been created since the time of Charles I.\n\nSupporters may also be granted to corporations which have a royal charter.\n\n"}

Around 1927 or 1928 he independently invented a writing system for the Chukchi language. It has never been established with certainty whether the symbols in this writing system were ideograms/pictograms or whether the system was logogram-based. Researchers have noted the abstract character of the symbols, which may be an indirect evidence that this writing system is entirely Tenevil's invention.\nTenevil's writing system was first described by the Russian ethnographer and writer Waldemar Bogoras in 1930. The writing system was never widely known: it was used entirely within Tenevil's family encampment. Apart from Tenevil himself, the writing system was used by his son, with whom he exchanged messages during shifts away at the reindeer pastures. Tenevil wrote his symbols on boards, bones, walrus tusks, and candy wrappers.\nThis writing system is a unique phenomenon, and has wider significance to the research into the origins of writing traditions in the cultures in the pre-state stage of development. Tenevil's Chukchi writing system is the most northerly of all such systems to be developed by indigenous people with minimal outside influence.\nThe sources and prototype of the Tenevil writing system are unknown. Taking into consideration the isolation of Chukotka from the regional centres of civilization, it could be considered a localized creative initiative of a lone genius. It is possible the writing system is influenced by the decorations on shamans' drums. The word \"writing\" (kelikel) in the Chukchi language has Tungusic parallels.\nIn 1945 the artist and art historian I. Lavrov visited the upper reaches of the Anadyr River where Tenevil had lived. There he discovered the \"Tenevil archive\": a box, buried in the snow, containing relics of Tenevil's writing. Tenevil also developed symbols for numerals, using the base 20 counting system of the Chukchi language. About 1000 basic elements of the Tenevil writing system have been identified.\nThe Chukchi writer Yuri Rytkheu dedicated his 1969 novel \"A Dream in Polar Fog\" to Tenevil.\n\n\n\n"}

He is often referred to as one of the greatest sources in the historiography of Croatian lands.\n\nWhat is known about Thomas' life comes from his work, \"Historia Salonitana\". He speaks of his life in the third person and very briefly, in the style of medieval literature genres. Thomas was born in Split at the beginning of the 13th century. It is not known whether he was of noble or common birth, but he represented the elite Roman culture that had survived from before the Slav migration, and he had a negative view of Slavs, often mistakenly conflating them in his chronicle with the Goths. He was probably educated at the cathedral school in Split. Around 1222 he was sent to study at the University of Bologna. There he perfected skills (under, among others, Accursius) in law, rhetoric, gramathic and notary (\"ars dictandi\" and ars \"notaria\"). He saw Saint Francis of Assisi in Bologna, a remarkable event which he mentioned in his work, describing the person of Saint Francis.\nUpon returning to his hometown of Split he advanced fast in church hierarchy. He became notary official (ca. 1227), then (1230) the archdeacon (head of the body of canons). He described Mongol siege of Split (1242), Mongol customs and homeland, thus creating the first ethnological writings in local historiography. In 1243 a body of canons chose Thomas to be archbishop of Split, however due to his views on Church autonomy in Split, commoners rebelled against him. Fearing for his life, he never occupied that function, and in the end resigned the honor. Because of that, in his work he wrote about future archbishops with bitterness. He died in Split on May 8, 1268. Today, his grave lies in the Church of St. Francis.\n\nThomas was a stern advocate of medieval commune movement in Split. He wrote about Croatian nobles (and Hungarian kings in his time) in the hinterland of the city with great animosity, because they tried to crush the autonomy of the city. And conversely, he treated fairly those who respected the commune autonomy (Croatian kings, and later, Hungarian kings in the 12th century). In 1239 he organized new („latin“) administration in Split, bringing Gargane de Ascindis from Ancona, as the new Podestà. He was also an advocate of Church autonomy within the city (in accordance with official Roman Church teaching) which excluded commoners and citizens from interfering in Church business (such as the election of the archbishop).\n\nThomas' only work is the \"Historia Salonitana\", the history of the archibishops of Salona and Split written in Latin. The work itself is combining three medieval history genres – \"historia\", \"chronica\" and \"memoriale\". Eventually, his work outgrows the narrow theme of archbishops, and becomes an outstanding literary achievement which encompasses the whole of the Croatian medieval period up to the 13th century. Because of Thomas' original research in the archbisphoric's archive in Split, he brings facts and news from documents today unknown to contemporary historians. His work is therefore not only of great literally value, but also of historical value for Croatian history.\n"}

Ferguson was born fourth of six children in the former fur trading post of Fort Vermilion, Alberta, approximately 800 km north of Edmonton. His parents split up when he was six years old, during a brief interlude in Regina. At the age of 16, he quit school and moved to Saskatoon, Dauphin, and Red Deer.\n\nFerguson is also an outspoken critic of the monarchy of Canada, both publicly and in his books. He is quoted in the media when the monarchy issue is being debated. He also profiles Canadian secessionist and independence movements (such as the \"Republic of Madawaska\") in his book \"Beauty Tips from Moose Jaw\" (2004).\n\nHe completed his high school education at Lindsay Thurber Comprehensive High School (L.T.C.H.S.) in Red Deer, and was awarded the Alexander Rutherford Scholarships in all available categories. He then joined the Canadian government funded programs Katimavik and Canada World Youth. The latter program sent him to Ecuador in South America, as described in his book \"Why I Hate Canadians\". He studied film production and screenwriting at York University in Toronto, graduating with a B.F.A.

He was closely involved in the politics of Northern Ireland, and had fascist tendencies.\n\nBorn in London and brought up in Hertfordshire, he was educated at Eton College (1914-1918), where he began to learn Russian and Turkish. He published his first book, \"The Turks in Europe\", when he was eighteen. He was a special correspondent for the \"Morning Post\" during the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) and the Rif War (1925).\n\nIn the pre-World War II years, he travelled a lot and conducted extensive research on the history of the peoples of the Caucasus and Anatolia. In 1930, along with Sir Oliver Wardrop, he founded the Georgian Historical Society; the Society published its own journal, \"Georgica\", dedicated to Kartvelian studies.\n\nHis mother financed his personal enterprises until around 1935, and also provided a home at Commonwood House, Chipperfield, Hertfordshire, where he and his brothers could bring their guests at weekends: in Allen's case, he wrote later, these would include 'bizarre intellectuals, Caucasian philologists and exiled national leaders from the remoter parts of Central Asia'.\n\nIn 1940-1, he accompanied Orde Wingate on his mission to Abyssinia, and wrote a book of his experiences called \"Guerrilla War in Abyssinia\". On 6 March 1941 the Italian division won a victory; what they did know was that a much smaller force opposed them. Wingate set out to fool them in a game of deception: Allen remarked \"Perhaps God fights on the side of great hearts and not of the big battalions.\" The tactic of surprise attacks behind unnerved the garrison at Debra Markos which scarpered in some disorder. He also met and recorded the activities of other SOE comrades Tony Simonds and Billy Maclean remarkable for their informality and eccentricities as their soldierly demeanour.\n\nHe wrote with Paul Muratoff (Pavel Muratov) two volumes on the Russian campaign for Penguin Books. John Erickson wrote that they (particularly the second volume) are examples of skilful exploitation of contemporary sources, and even today retain considerable value, including the elucidation of terrain factors.\n\nAllen was a Foreign Service officer from 1943—notably information counsellor at Ankara between 1947 and 1949—until he stepped down and returned to his native Ulster in 1949. There he divided his working time between running the family business (\"David Allen's\", a major bill-posting company) and writing the two major books which he completed during the 1950s: \"Caucasian Battlefields\" (1953, with Pavel Muratov), and \"David Allens\" (1957, an account of the business and a collective biography of the Allen family). His last book, \"Russian Embassies to the Georgian Kings (1589-1605)\", written with the help of the translator Anthony Mango, was published in two volumes by the Hakluyt Society in 1970.\n\nAfter his death in 1973, his extensive library of books on Georgia and the Caucasus was estimated at £30,000 (worth between £280,000 and £530,000 in 2014). This library is now part of the Indiana University's Lilly Library, which describes it as being 'rich in travel narratives, chronicles and works in linguistics, and [containing] a number of books and some manuscripts in the Georgian language'.\n\nAllen stood unsuccessfully in Fermanagh and Tyrone at the 1922 general election, but was elected seven years later on his next attempt, at the 1929 general election as the Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for Belfast West.\n\nHe defected from the Unionists in 1931, to join Sir Oswald Mosley's New Party, but did not contest the 1931 general election. He was a close friend of Mosley helping him to pursue his fascist ambitions from behind the scenes, by supporting him financially and by contributing mainly anonymous articles to \"The Blackshirt\", including \"The Letters of Lucifer\". Allen also wrote \"BUF, Oswald Mosley and British Fascism\" (1934) under the pen name of \"James Drennan\".\n\nIt was believed that assertions he was an MI5 informant were false however documents now available in the National Archive confirm that he was interviewed by MI5 and gave over information regarding the BUF's funding from Fascist Italy.\n\nHe was married: (1) from 1922 to 1932, to Lady Phyllis Edith King (1897–1947), the daughter of Lionel Fortescue King, 3rd Earl of Lovelace (1865–1929); (2) from 1932 to 1939, to Paula Gellibrand (1898–1986), once one of Cecil Beaton's favourite models, formerly the wife of the Marquis de Casa Maury and formerly the wife of Ivan Wilkie Brooks; and (3) from 1943, to Nathalie Maximovna (c.1900-1966).\n"}

He was also a critic of colonial rule and an early advocate of self-government for colonial territories in Africa and of what became known as development aid.\n\nMacmillan was born in Aberdeen, Scotland on 1 October 1885. He was the son of the Reverend John Macmillan (born Glen Urquhart, Inverness, Scotland 1831, died Stellenbosch, South Africa,1909). His mother was Elizabeth Caird Lindsay (born Glasgow, Scotland 1845, died Cape Town, South Africa,1927). John Macmillan served with the Free Church of Scotland mission in India and was a founder with the Reverend William Miller of the Free Church College in Madras, India, now the Madras Christian College.\n\nWilliam Macmillan travelled to South Africa in 1891 with his mother and five elder siblings to join his father, who was working at the Victoria College, Stellenbosch, now the University of Stellenbosch. He attended the Boys High School, Stellenbosch, and did the first two years of the BA degree at the Victoria College, matriculating in 1901 and passing the intermediate exams in 1903. Following the death of Cecil Rhodes in 1902, Macmillan was in 1903 one of the first group of Rhodes Scholars at Oxford University in England.\n\nMacmillan studied modern history at Merton College and graduated in 1906. He enrolled for the divinity course at the Free Church College in Aberdeen, and also studied divinity in Glasgow, but he did not proceed to the ministry. An important influence on Macmillan's later work was the semester that he spent at the Kaiser Wilhelm University in Berlin in 1910. He was fluent in German (as well as Dutch and Afrikaans) and attended the lectures of the ecclesiastical historian, Adolf von Harnack, the economic historian Gustav Schmoller, and the pioneer sociologist, Franz Oppenheimer. Macmillan joined the Fabian Society in 1911 and remained an evolutionary socialist or social democrat for most of his life, reverting to liberalism in old age.\n\nMacmillan returned to South Africa in 1911 to become a lecturer in history and economics at Rhodes University College, Grahamstown, South Africa, where he remained until 1917, when he became the first professor of history at the Johannesburg School of Mines (later the University of the Witwatersrand).\n\nWhile in Grahamstown, Macmillan did pioneering work on poverty among white South Africans. He was the only English-speaking delegate at the Dutch Reformed Church congress on White Poverty, which was held at Cradock, Eastern Cape in 1916. Macmillan's first published work appeared anonymously as a pamphlet, \"Sanitary Reform for Grahamstown\" in 1915. This was followed in the same year by \"Economic Conditions in a Non-industrial South African Town\". In 1918, Macmillan did substantial fieldwork on white poverty in rural areas, resulting in lectures and a book, \"The South African Agrarian Problem and its Historical Development\", published in Johannesburg in 1919.\n\nIn 1920, the family of Dr John Philip entrusted Macmillan with his papers. Philip was the superintendent of the London Missionary Society in South Africa in the first half of the 19th century. In the following decade, Macmillan produced two important books, \"The Cape Colour Question\" (1927) and \"Bantu, Boer and Briton: The Making of the South African Native Problem\". These books rewrote the history of South Africa in the first half of the nineteenth century, introducing a new emphasis on the history of South Africa as the history of all its people. The third volume of a trilogy, \"Complex South Africa\" (1930), brought together his early work on white poverty with work done in the 1920s on African poverty, including his pioneering work on the economics of the reserves, and his 'sample survey' of the Herschel district in Eastern Cape.\n\nMacmillan was one of the first people to articulate a vision of South African as a single society. This view brought him into conflict with the segregationist government of the day as well as with liberal segregationists. He became chairman of the Johannesburg Joint Council of Natives and Europeans and was involved in 1932 with public clashes with the ministers of Native Affairs and of Justice – the latter was Oswald Pirow. After the University of Witwatersrand sought to gag Macmillan, he went on sabbatical leave at the end of 1932, but he did not return to the university. He resigned in September 1933.\n\nAfter the completion of his work on Dr John Philip in 1929, Macmillan began traveling in Central, East, and West Africa. At this time, he began work on issues of governance in Colonial Africa. He published this work as \"Africa Emergent\" in 1938. Macmillan was a major critic of colonial rule and an advocate of a gradual democratisation of colonial rule through the introduction of representative, as opposed to 'traditional', systems of local government. He was at the same time critical of the colonial doctrine of financial self-sufficiency and became an advocate of aid. Macmillan had travelled to the United States and the West Indies in 1934-5 and was shocked by the neglect of the West Indian islands. His critique of colonial rule in these territories was published as \"Warning from the West Indies\" in 1936 - it was republished as a Penguin special in 1938.\n\nFollowing his return to the United Kingdom in 1932, Macmillan was unable to secure academic employment and remained self-employed until after the outbreak of World War II. He was, however, active in a number of pressure groups including the Friends of Africa, the Anti-Slavery Society, the British Labour Party's committee on Imperial Questions, and with the Trade Union Congress.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Second World War he became a member of the Colonial Office Advisory Committee on Education and was a member of the Channon sub-committee on Higher Education. This drew up the guidelines for the postwar expansion of university education in Africa and the West Indies. He was also a signatory of the report on Mass Education which recommended the extension of primary and adult education in the colonies. From 1941-3 he worked as director of Empire Intelligence for the BBC. In that capacity, Macmillan helped lay the foundations of the World and Africa Services of the BBC.\n\nFrom 1943-6 Macmillan was Senior Representative of the British Council in West Africa. He was based at Accra in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), but was also responsible for the inauguration of the council's work in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and the Gambia, including libraries and scholarship schemes.\n\nAfter the war, the postwar Labour government supported Macmillan's appointment as director of Colonial Studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He returned to South Africa for the first time in seventeen years to give the Hoernle Memorial lecture in Durban in 1949. In 1951 the British government sent Macmillan on a three-man observer mission to Bechuanaland to advise on the status of Tshekedi Khama who had been excluded from the Bamangwato Reserve in the wake of the crisis over the marriage of Seretse and Ruth Khama.\n\nMacmillan retired from St Andrews in 1954 and served for one year, 1954-5, as acting professor of History at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica. After his wartime experience in West Africa, he became skeptical about the claims of African Nationalism and was broadly supportive of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which the British government saw as a bulwark against the spread of Afrikaner nationalism from the south and African nationalism from the north.\n\nHe married firstly in 1913 Jean Sutherland, daughter of the Reverend John Sutherland of Uitenhague, South Africa, and, secondly, Mona Constance Marion Tweedie, daughter of Admiral Sir Hugh Tweedie, KCB, and his wife, Constance Marion (Mona) Crossman. He acknowledged the help of his first wife in the production of his first four books and of his second wife in the production of his later works. He met Mona Tweedie in 1931 and was married to her after divorce from his first wife in 1936. Mona Macmillan became an author in her own right, publishing \"Introducing East Africa\" in 1952, \"The Land of Look Behind: A Study of Jamaica\" (1957), \"Mediator and Moderator: The life of Sir Henry Barkly\" (1969), \"Champion of Africa: W.M. Macmillan, the second phase\" (1985), and a memoir, \"Mona's Story\", posthumously, in 2008. She also edited the writings of the controversial Zambian archbishop, Emmanuel Milingo, and, with her daughter, Catriona, the correspondence of the Pratt family. She died in Oxfordshire in 2003 at the age of 95. There were no children from the first marriage and four children from the second marriage.\n\nHis elder son, the eminent art historian and writer Duncan Macmillan FRSA FRSE HRSA, is Emeritus Professor of Art History at the University of Edinburgh and was curator of the university's Talbot Rice Gallery. He is the author of books including \"Scottish Art, 1460-2000\", \"Painting in Scotland: The Golden Age\", \"Painting in Scotland in the Twentieth Century\" and \"Scotland's Shrine: The Scottish National War Memorial\". He is the art critic of The Scotsman.\n\nHis younger son, Hugh Macmillan, has worked at universities in Swaziland, Zambia and South Africa, and is currently a research associate at the African Studies Centre, University of Oxford. He is the author of \"The Lusaka Years: The ANC in Exile in Zambia, 1963–94\" (2013); \"An African Trading Empire: The story of Susman Brothers & Wulfsohn\" (2005), and of \"Zion in Africa: The Jews of Zambia\" (1999, with Frank Shapiro). He has also written pocket biographies of Chris Hani, Jack Simons and Oliver Tambo and is the co-editor with Shula Marks of \"Africa and Empire: W.M. Macmillan, historian and social critic\" (1989). His elder daughter, Lindsay, married Alexander Arthur Dow, and had a career as a teacher in Zambia and Scotland. His younger daughter, Catriona, married Colonel Alistair Miller, Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, and had a career as a hotelier in Dorset. She edited, with her mother, \"Exiles of Empire\", the nineteenth century correspondence of the Pratt family between Scotland, India and Australia.\n\nMacmillan was awarded honorary degrees of D.Litt. by Oxford University in 1957, University of Natal in 1962, and Edinburgh University in 1974.\n\n\n\nThe papers of W. M. Macmillan and Mona Macmillan have been deposited at the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford.\n"}

It emphasizes the harsh aspects of Midwestern rural life under the pressures of crime, disease, mental illness, and urbanization.\n\nThe book was adapted into a film in 1999.\n\nThe 1999 film adaptation was directed by James Marsh as a docudrama. It was shot primarily in black-and-white, with contrasting color sequences of modern life in the area. It combined re-enactments of some of the events described in the book with a voice-over narration by Ian Holm. Its visual style was intended to carry the content of the film; as Marsh said:\n\nI wanted to convey in the film the real pathos contained in a four line newspaper report that simultaneously records and dismisses the end of someone’s life.\n\nMusic<br>\nThe book inspired a number of musical works, including the opera \"Black River\" by Conrad Susa, which was composed in 1975 and revised 1981; the \"dramatic cantata\" \"Songs of Madness and Sorrow\" by Daron Hagen; and the 1999 album \"Wisconsin Death Trip\" by the band Static-X. British post-punk band Echo & the Bunnymen used photographs from the book as artwork for their 2001 album \"Flowers\", as well as its singles. A song performed by Jerry Joseph was inspired by the title of the film. Most recently, the book was adapted into a bluegrass/roots-rock opera by Tim Raphael and composer Jeff Berkson, which had its world premiere at Georgetown University's Davis Performing Arts Center on February 1, 2008. The soundtrack for the film adaptation of the book features original music by DJ Shadow and John Cale.\n\nLiterature<br>\nThe Australian author Rod Jones cites \"Wisconsin Death Trip\" as an inspiration for his novel \"Billy Sunday\", and the American author Robert Goolrick also cites it as an inspiration for his novel \"A Reliable Wife.\" Stephen King's book of novellas, \"Full Dark, No Stars\", cites \"Wisconsin Death Trip\" as the inspiration for the story \"1922\". The American author Stewart O'Nan \"acknowledges his great debt to Michael Lesy,\" citing \"Wisconsin Death Trip\" as an inspiration for his novel \"A Prayer for the Dying\". (NB: at least one early Picador edition misattributes this to \"Michael Levy\".)\n\nFilm<br>\nIn commentary on the two-disc DVD release of the Bob Dylan biopic \"I'm Not There\", director Todd Haynes said that much of the imagery for the town of Riddle in the Richard Gere segment of the film was inspired by Lesy's book. Director Walter Murch also used the book as an historical source for the 1985 cult classic \"Return to Oz\".\n\nTelevision<br>\nThe creators of the show \"The Heart, She Holler\" have discussed being influenced by the book in the creation of their show about rural America.\n\nNotes\n"}

(Czech pronunciation: [ˈZdenyek 'Car-neek]; 25 June 1931 in Dobré, Rychnov nad Kněžnou District - 30 September 2011 in Prague) was a Czech historian and pedagogue.\n\nZdeněk Kárník was born to the family of Eastern Bohemian tradesman František Kárník. His early influences include his elder brother František who worked as a lecturer and later as an assistant professor at Vysoká škola politických a hospodářských věd (University of Political and Economic Sciences) and was a resolute patriot and an anti-nazi resistance supporter during World War II; he died prematurely at age 38. Zdeněk Kárník graduated from the Reálné gymnázium F. M. Pelcla (F. M. Pelcl High School) in Rychnov nad Kněžnou and was a student of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the UPES from 1950; the Faculty was merged with the Faculty of Philosophy and History of the Charles University from 1952; and he started teaching at the institution in 1954, becoming a modern Czechoslovak history lecturer in 1965. Zdeněk Kárník got involved in the renascence movement of 1968 at the Faculty; as a result, he had to quit teaching in 1969 and was forced to leave the faculty altogether one year later. He was permitted to return in 1990 (as the Head of the Social History Seminar of the Institute for Economic and Social History). In the meantime (1970–1990), he worked at the State Heritage Care Centre for the Central Bohemian Region. He published in the \"samizdat\" (as an editor of \"Historický sborník\" - \"Historical Proceedings\", published 1978 to 1989) and/or under other names. He has worked at the Charles University in Prague, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and University of Pedagogy in Hradec Králové – Faculty of Arts, later Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Hradec Králové. In 1993 he was an adjunct professor at Ruhr-Universität Bochum, and he was on internship in Vienna in 1998. A member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia between 1956 and 1969, he left the party later on (expulsed in 1970). His hobbies included skiing, hiking, and classical music.\n\nZdeněk Kárník initially focused on the history of the workers' movement and socialist parties, extending his interest later on to the history of the First and Second Czechoslovak Republics (1918–1939) in relation to the period of the existence of Austria-Hungary: \"Socialisté na rozcestí: Habsburk, Masaryk či Šmeral?\" (\"Socialists at the Crossroads: The Habsburg, Masaryk, or Šmeral?\" 1968, extended edition in 1996), \"České země v éře První republiky (1918–1938)\", I–III (\"Bohemia in the First Republic Era (1918-1938)\", ed. 2000-2003), \"Malé dějiny československé (1867–1939)\" (\"Small History of Czechoslovakia (1867–1039)\", 2007). Professor Kárník’s professional creed was: “Find the cause of the phenomenon regardless of others’ and your own previous conviction or opinion.”\n\nIn his inaugural dissertation, \"První pokusy o založení komunistické strany v Čechách\" (\"Initial Attempts at Founding a Communist Party in Bohemia\"), he focused on radical leftist groupings, primarily anarchists and anarchist-communists. His chef d’oeuvre about ‘socialists at the crossroads’ focuses in detail on the developments in the social democrats’ policies in Bohemia during the First World War in the Czech, Austrian-Hungarian, and international political context. The extensive trilogy on the First Republic brings a multifaceted analysis and description of the political, economic, demographic, social, and cultural and scientific development between the two world wars. The book is illustrated with images and tables, and the third tome analyses in detail the tragic period of the way to Munich Agreement. The work also takes into consideration the developments in Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. His subsequent (and again extensive) work with a modest title of \"Small History of Czechoslovakia (1867–1939)\" approaches the topic from new positions. The timeline in itself is of principal importance, suggesting that the author examined both the prelude to the rise of the first Czechoslovak state towards the close of the Habsburg monarchy and its epilogue – the Second Republic. The delivery tends towards the non-fiction fiction genre, in places focusing even more on the topics brought up by the ‘trilogy’, with more attention focused on Slovakia. Compared with the ‘trilogy’, the illustrations are much more extensive and illustration captions have the form of extensive explanations.\n\nKárník’s editorial work is also of importance: Karel Kazbunda, \"Otázka česko-německá v předvečer Velké války\" (\"Czech-German Question at the Dawn of the Great War\", 1995), \"Bolševismus, komunismus a radikální socialismus v Československu\", I–V (\"Bolshevism, Communism, and Radical Socialism in Czechoslovakia\", 2003–2005), \"K novověkým sociálním dějinám českých zemí\", I–IV (\"On the Modern Times History of Bohemia\", 1998–2001), etc. He also wrote a number of articles, essays, and 2 children’s books about a group of boys set in the vicinity of Castle Handštejn during World War II.\n\nZdeněk Kárník has also contributed to the periodicals \"Památkářské práce\" (\"Heritage Works\"), \"Acta Oeconomica Pragensia\",\" Historický obzor\" (\"Historical Horizon\"), \"Východočeské listy historické\" (\"Eastern Bohemian Historical Letters\"), \"Acta historica et museologica Universitatis Silesianae Opaviensis\" et al., to the Larousse encyclopaedia, and a number of collections and publications focusing on heritage preservation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8909373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8909373", "title": "Édouard Charton", "text": "Édouard Charton\n\nÉdouard Charton (11 May 1807 – 27 February 1890) was an eminent French literary figure who was the founder and, for fifty-five years (1833–88), editor-in-chief of the publication \"Magasin pittoresque\", in addition to serving for thirty years (1860–90) as director of publication for Hachette. \nA native of Sens in the Bourgogne \"région\", Édouard Charton trained as a lawyer, receiving his degree at the age of 20. His first great dedication to a cause came two years later when, during 1829–31, using his oratorical skills, he became a traveling propagator for the social philosophy of Saint-Simonism, which ultimately resulted for him in great disappointment.\n\nFrom his mid-forties onward, he spent many years in politics, serving in the National Assembly as Deputy and Senator, expressing his convictions which formed a continuation and refinement of the previous century's Age of Enlightenment: faith in progress and the emancipation of people through education; respect for human dignity, constant fight for the dissemination of knowledge and political action in favor of liberal and republican ideas.\n\nHe reaffirmed the moral values acquired within his family and found inspiration in the works of Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, the mystic who used \"Unknown Philosopher\" as his nom de plume. He also gathered experience in philanthropy, discovered the problems involved in the social condition of man, tested solutions, and worked for what he felt were noble causes, establishing durable and useful friendships with men who shared common ideals.\n\nIn 1833 he put into effect his ideals of \"fighting ignorance\" by starting a new publication \"Le Magasin pittoresque\" (\"pittoresque\" means that the publication was illustrated). He was inspired by the British Penny Magazine.\nHe remained at the helm director of the successful enterprise until 1888, past his eightieth birthday. For more than a half-century, he always pursued the same aims, while collecting and writing texts, selecting engravings, and supervising the printing and distribution of what he referred to as an \"out-of-order encyclopedia\".\n\nApplying the same rigor and consistency, he chose the best collaborators to propagate practical knowledge while stimulating curiosity and forming artistic tastes. \"L'Illustration\", a renowned pictorial review, created in 1843 on his initiative, lasted a century (to 1944). In 1860, he embarked upon a working partnership with Louis Hachette and his successors, which would continue for the remaining thirty years of his life. It gave him the opportunity to reach new readers with the travel and exploration review \"Le Tour du Monde\" (\"World Tour\") and the scientific publication \"Bibliothèque des merveilles\" (\"Library of Wonders\").\nBased on the conviction that man could improve and progress through the acquisition of knowledge, Charton applied his considerable efforts disseminating \"practical knowledge\" to the greatest number, using his great writing talent only to inform and provide moral guidance. After the French Revolution of 1848, his friend Hippolyte Carnot, who was appointed the Minister of Public Instruction and Religion, recruited Charton as Secretary General of the Ministry. It was the beginning of his political career.\n\nAlthough an opponent of Napoleon III's 1852 Second Empire, Charton adapted to the circumstances, without ever denying his Republican convictions. He promoted public reading with the creation of popular libraries, participated in the creation of the Paris Museum of Anthropology and showed throughout his life a consistency of behavior as testified by his friends and two generations of colleagues.\nHe was described as a man of action able to overcome his anxiety-ridden personal nature. Faithful in friendship, he maintained relations with those who shared his belief in the moral progress of man, whereby the progress of each individual led to the progress of humanity as a whole. In the National Assembly, he remained in the background despite his talents as a speaker. When he did take the floor, it was to raise crucial points speak concerning questions of education, fine arts and the press, as well as to express his opposition to the death penalty.\n\nEncouraging his colleagues to reach a consensus, he could also remain firm and intransigent on points of principle. During the Second Empire, he turned down the post of director of the Comédie française which would have necessitated swearing an oath to the Emperor. \nPolitical misalliances prevented him from attaining what would have been the crowning glories of his life—serving as Head of Administration, or as Minister of Fine Arts, both opportunities to demonstrate his organizational talents.\n\nÉdouard Charton died in Versailles at the age of 82.\n\n\n"}
