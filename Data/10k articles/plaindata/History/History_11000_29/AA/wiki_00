An innovator of the 20th-century Latin American novel, he was a founding member of the literary \"Grupo de Guayaquil\" (\"Group of Guayaquil\"). The government of President Jaime Roldós Aguilera (1979–81) appointed him Chancellor of the Republic and he served as Foreign Minister of Ecuador (1979–80) and Ambassador to France (1983–84).\n\nPareja was born in Guayaquil Guayaquil in 1908, the son of Fernando Pareja y Pareja (1862-1919) and of Amalia Diez-Canseco y Coloma (1865–1945), daughter of the former Peruvian President Francisco Diez Canseco y Corbacho. He had to support his family from the age of 14, reading at night and assisting as a listener at the Colegio Vicente Rocafuerte. His early education was accomplished in his hometown: primary school at the Colegio San Luis Gonzaga of the Christian Brothers.\n\nIn 1930, Pareja embarked on a footloose adventure in the United States. As a result of the Great Depression he worked on the New York City docks for a year (his later novel \"El Muelle\" reflects these experiences). Back in Ecuador, he became a professor of history and of Spanish and Spanish American literature at Universidad Laica Vicente Rocafuerte de Guayaquil. He also served as a Superintendent of Secondary Education and as a Deputy of Guayas Province. In 1934 he married his cousin, Mercedes Cucalón Concha niece of Carlos Concha Torres with whom he had three children, Cecilia, Jorge and Francisco.\n\nDuring the dictatorship of Federico Páez (1935–37), however, Pareja was incarcerated and ultimately exiled to Chile where he was employed by the Ercilla Publishing House. Returning to Ecuador, he became a member of the Assembly, but was jailed again by the regime of President Aurelio Mosquera Narvaez. (This 30-day detainment formed the basis of his novel, \"Hombres sin tiempo\"). He was Ecuador's chargé d'affaires in Mexico in 1944. In 1945 he became a special representative for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in Washington D.C. and later Montevideo and Buenos Aires for the Governments of México, Central America, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.\n\nBetween August 1979 and July 1980, during the government of President Jaime Roldós Aguilera, Pareja was appointed to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. During the rule of Roldós's successor, President Osvaldo Hurtado, he served as Permanent Delegate to UNESCO and Ambassador to Paris (1983–84).\n\nAfter retirement, Pareja dedicated his time to historical research. He died in Quito on 1 May 1993.\n\nPareja, of a conservative family, was part of a “socialist generation” in Ecuador. He lived through considerable political turmoil in the 1920s and concluded that his country’s salvation lay on the left side of the political spectrum. He denied, however, being a “left-winger” and insisted that he did not desire to use the fiction writer’s art as an instrument of propaganda. Rather, he sought to simply and directly depict social conditions that called for redress, while denouncing those in power who were guilty of corruption and injustice. His first novel, \"La casa de los locos\" (1929), satirized Ecuadorian politics and attacked so many real people that publication was considerably delayed. Pareja attested to the strong influence of the Mexican writer and politician José Vasconcelos. Other major literary influences included the Greek Classics, Balzac, Dostoievski, Thomas Mann, Will Durant and Arnold Toynbee. Some critics have also detected the influence of Freud, Ehrenburg, Gide and Proust in him.\n\nPareja's cycle of narrative fiction was marked by realism and a strong connection with the history of his country (\"El muelle\" [“The Pier”], 1933; \"Hombres sin tiempo\" [“Men Without Time”], 1941; \"Las tres ratas\" [The Three Rats], 1944). Having established a reputation as a writer both inside and outside of Ecuador, in 1944 he published an important novel biography, \"The Barbaric Bonfire\", about the actions and historical circumstances surrounding the life and death of General Eloy Alfaro. A new cycle of novels started in 1956 with \"La advertencia\" (“The Warning\") and continued with \"El aire y los recuerdos\" (“Air and Memories”; 1959) and \"Los poderes omnímodos\" (“All-embracing Powers”; 1964). It was ambitious to describe the evolution of Ecuadorian society since 1925. Subsequently, he published the novel \"Las pequeñas estaturas\" (\"Small Statures\"; 1970) and authored an essay on “Thomas Mann and the New Humanism” (1956) and “Essays on Essays” (1981). (To date his works have not been translated into English.)\n\nPareja maintained a long association with the famous \"Guayaquil Group\" of Ecuadorian writers (José de la Cuadra, Joaquin Gallegos Lara, Demetrio Aguilera Malta, Enrique Gil Gilbert). He also associated with Jorge Luis Borges, Juan David García Bacca, John Dos Passos, Arnold Toynbee, Julio Cortázar, Alvaro Mutis, Jorge Enrique Adoum, Benjamin Carrión, Oswaldo Guayasamín and his nephew Miguel Donoso Pareja. The only biography about Pareja was written by the journalist and writer Francisco Febres Cordero.\n\nPareja maintained periodical correspondence with John Steinbeck.\n\nThe President Galo Plaza Lasso, worked with Pareja in educational projects after World War II around the globe, mostly in Central and South America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlfredo Pareja is included in the following anthologies: \n\n\n"}

He was author of the 1887 book, \"History of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan\".\n\nBlackbird was born in the L'Arbre Croche area of Michigan (now Harbor Springs) around 1815. At least one account, though, places this date as late as 1821. His father was an Ottawa chief named Mack-e-te-be-nessy (\"Makade-binesi\", \"black hawk\"). The name was mistranslated first by the French and from French to English as \"Blackbird\", which became the family's English name. Makade-binesi was chief of the Arbor Croche or Middle Village band. Makade-binesi was stranded on a small island by white traders he was helping, and was left to die. Although his father survived, this cruelty left a strong impression on Andrew. The death of his brother, William, in Rome, Italy on June 25, 1833, under suspicious circumstances as he was completing his studies for the Roman Catholic priesthood, left an indelible impression on Andrew and perhaps was the source of his intense antipathy for that religion from then on.\n\nBlackbird frequently bemoaned his limited formal education. Because his father was a chief, Blackbird was solidly educated in traditional Ottawa culture and practices.\n\nBlackbird was baptized a Roman Catholic by a priest called Father Baden in 1825, but later converted to Protestantism. He served as interpreter at the Protestant mission in L'Arbre Croche. Even though he was a Christian, he knew the traditional Ottawa religious beliefs well.\n\nBlackbird was trained as a blacksmith at mission schools in the L'Arbre Croche area. He studied for four years at Twinsburg Institute in Twinsburg in Summit County, Ohio, but left without graduating. In 1850 his elderly father's health worsened. This forced Blackbird to leave school and return home to assist the old chief. Later he attended Eastern Michigan University (then called Michigan State Normal School) in Ypsilanti, Michigan, for two years, but again did not graduate. In June 1858 Blackbird wrote his Twinsburg Institute mentor Rev. Samuel Bissell: \"...I continue to attend the State Normal School at Ypsilanti, but am getting somewhat discouraged as to ever being perfect in the knowledge of English Language. I have begun rather too late of attending those things. I shall always speak__indistinctly__ungrammatically__for being so deeply rooted or stained with my own language...I have begun a grammar in the Indian tongue__intended to write it upon the same plan in which our first books in Latin and Greek are written...And this I thought would be about as good that I can do for them, since I cannot personally do good among them, so at least, they can have my writings if not prohibited by their Priests...The last I heard of my father were still living but very old and feeble...Our school is let out on the 25th of July__and vacation will last 10 or 11 weeks. I should like to have gone to visit my people but I am considerable in debt, therefore I will have to work out somewheres here during the time, in order to pay up my debts.\"\n\nBlackbird was loyal to the United States during various uprisings. In 1858 Blackbird married Elizabeth Margaret Fish, a white woman of English descent. As a result, he was viewed favorably by the United States.\n\nBy the 1850s, Blackbird had become a counselor for both sides between the United States government and the Ottawa and Ojibwa peoples. Blackbird helped veterans of the United States who were Native Americans receive their pensions. He also assisted in settling land claims. During this time, Blackbird strongly advocated that citizenship be granted to the Ottawa and other Native Americans.\n\nWhen the \"Treaty With The Ottawa and Chippewa\" was signed on July 31, 1855, Blackbird served as an interpreter, translator and official witness ().\n\nIn 1858, Blackbird bought a house in Harbor Springs, Michigan, and settled there permanently. At the time, Harbor Springs was still primarily populated by Ottawas. Blackbird became the town's postmaster.\n\nIn 1887, Blackbird published his \"History of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan\". The work was published in Ypsilanti, Michigan, by the Ypsilantian Job Printing House. The book was among the first authoritative accounts of the Ottawa and Ojibwa (Chippewa) peoples ever published.\n\nThe book covers not only historical facts, but day-to-day details of how the Ottawa and Ojibwa hunted, fished and trapped before the coming of the whites. Blackbird explains many of the traditional beliefs and cultural practices of the two tribes. Because the author was himself a Native American, the book is free of the bias commonly found in books by white authors of the period.\n\nFinally, the book includes a basic grammar of the Ottawa and Ojibwa languages.\n\nIn a 1900 publication, Blackbird said:\n\n\"But I have heard white people say that the Indians might just as well die, for nothing can be done with them, as they will always be wild and savage and cruel. They might as well all die or be killed, every one of them, from the face of the earth, for a dead Indian is better than a live Indian. These frightful statements are heard all over the United States and every Caucasian child and every Indian child that is able to understand, knows this dreadful feeling toward us. These statements are translated and republished in foreign countries so every foreigner coming to America comes with a prejudice and a persecuting spirit toward the aborigines of America. Therefore there is no peace nor shelter for the Indians, from injustice. They are exposed to hate, to be shot at, and to be robbed in every way and manner, of their little possessions of lands which the government has allotted to them in treaties. They are cheated by the crooked works of the law.\"\n\nThe Andrew J. Blackbird House in Harbor Springs, Michigan, is a museum of American Indian artifacts presented in the house in which Blackbird lived from 1858 until his death in 1908. There is a Michigan State Historical Marker at the site and the house itself is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n"}

By 1870, her family had migrated to Albany, New York, where Chapman would be raised in that city's thriving African-American community. She first attended Wilberforce School, before going on to Albany Free Academy (now Albany High School). In 1877, she became the first African American to graduate from the Free Academy, and by 1880, she was teaching music. Her marriage to Clarence Miller led Chapman to leave Albany, traveling with Miller to North Adams, Massachusetts, where he would be employed as a waiter and she would raise their children.\n\nChapman created two photographic albums in the 1870s and 1880s. These albums survive in the collection of the University of Michigan's William L. Clements Library. They are rare items that document Chapman's personal and political vision. The photographic portraits included those of notable figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, and John Brown. Most striking are the portraits of Chapman herself, along with her family and friends. Through Chapman's careful curatorship, the albums convey a sense of how African Americans constructed their social and cultural worlds in the post-Civil War era.\n\nChapman's photo albums were exhibited in the 2013–14 exhibition, Proclaiming Emancipation, at the University of Michigan as examples of how the memory of the Civil War, Emancipation, and citizenship was constructed by ordinary people.\n\nArabella Chapman's photo albums have been curated as part of an on-line exhibit, The Arabella Chapman Project at arabellachapman.com.\n\n"}
{"id": "3076558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3076558", "title": "Arild Huitfeldt", "text": "Arild Huitfeldt\n\nArild Huitfeldt (Arvid) (11 September 1546 – 16 December 1609) was a Danish historian and state official, known for his vernacular Chronicle of Denmark. \n\nHuitfeldt was born into an aristocratic family from Scania, part of the Kingdom of Denmark at the time. He was partly educated in Germany and France, made his career as a state official and was, from 1573 to 1580, First Secretary to the Danish Chancellery, the King's central administrative organ. From 1583 to his death he was also superintendent at Herlufsholm School, the first Danish boarding school. In 1586 he achieved his highest appointment, becoming \"Rigskansler\" (Chancellor of the Realm, the very approximate equivalent to a modern Minister of Justice), until shortly before his death. Huitfeldt also owned several manor estates and handled a number of diplomatic assignments. As a politician and as an official he appears to have been studious, conservative, and sociable, avoiding overt clashes with his colleagues. \n\nWhat has made Huitfeldt famous, however, is his contribution as a historian. He wrote the first great History of Denmark in vernacular Danish – \"Danmarks Riges Krønike\" (\"Chronicle of the Kingdom of Denmark\", 8 vols, 1595-1603), thus taking up the weighty legacy of Saxo Grammaticus. Huitfeldt was no official Danish historiographer, but at his time several official attempts at writing a comprehensive History of Denmark in Latin had come to little. Huitfeldt created a work that supplanted all earlier Latin attempts and more or less became \"the\" referential history work on Denmark until the time of Ludvig Holberg.\n\nThe Chronicle deals with Denmark from what was then a time of legend until 1559. It is mostly structured around the reigns of the various kings and was published in non-chronological order, beginning with the time of Christian III. Through published rather quickly, his work seems to have been prepared across several years. Being a state official with access to documents and with the possibility of using help from scribes, Huitfeldt did have many writing advantages. The form of his Chronicle is annalist but not narrowly limited to each single year. What makes it still more important is that Huitfeldt reproduces many documents and sources the originals of which are now lost. In that way his book is also a significant source collection.\n\nIn the Chronicle Huitfeldt reveals himself as a pragmatic aristocrat. A central view of his is that history repeats itself, but in aspects such as his emphasis on judicial and constitutional factors, he shows himself rather in advance of his time. At bottom, he remains subjective: his own ideal is that of the aristocratic state, in which the King respects the role and power of the nobility. Thus he may be held responsible for the extremely negative picture of Christian II, and the corresponding idealized version of Christian III, which for many years dominated Danish historical thinking. Yet as a whole, Huitfeldt is sober and calm, using plain and relatively unaffected language. While transmitting the ancient legends and myths he often shows scepticism as to their reliability, an attitude he halso partly displays toward later sources. His prefaces to the separate volumes of his history are themselves worth noting, as an additional testimonial to his political ideals.\n\n"}

In February 1981, the Commission concluded that the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II was a \"grave injustice.\" In July 1981, the Commission held public hearings in Washington, D.C. to hear testimony from Japanese-American and Alaska Native witnesses. Public hearings followed in other American cities, including Seattle, San Francisco, Cambridge, New York City, Anchorage, the Aleutian Islands, Pribilof Islands (St. Paul), Chicago, and Los Angeles, where the testimonies were recorded. More than 750 people testified. \n\nIn 1983, the CWRIC issued its findings in \"Personal Justice Denied\", concluding that the incarceration of Japanese Americans had not been justified by military necessity. Rather, the report determined that the decision to incarcerate was based on \"racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.\" \n\nLastly, the Commission recommended legislative remedies: an official Government apology and redress payments to survivors. Congress passed legislation and on August 10, 1988, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 was signed into law.

{"id": "4888396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4888396", "title": "Earl W. Bascom", "text": "Earl W. Bascom\n\nEarl Wesley Bascom (June 19, 1906 – August 28, 1995) was an American painter, printmaker, rodeo performer and sculptor, raised in Canada, who portrayed his own experiences cowboying and rodeoing across the American and Canadian West.\n\nBascom was born on June 19, 1906 in a sod-roofed log cabin on the Bascom 101 Ranch in Vernal, Utah, United States, the son of rancher and lawman John W. Bascom and Rachel Lybbert. His father had been a Uintah County deputy sheriff and later a constable in the town of Naples in northeast Utah, who chased members of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch Gang and other outlaws including Harry \"Mad Dog\" Tracy. Both of his grandfathers, Joel A. Bascom and C. F. B. Lybbert, were Mormon pioneers, frontier lawmen and ranchers. Joel Bascom was a member of the Nauvoo Legion and the Utah militia, serving in the Utah War of 1857 and the Utah Black Hawk War of 1865. He also served as Chief of Police in Provo, Utah and as the first constable in Mona, Utah. Lybbert, who served in the Danish army before coming to America, was a blacksmith who served as constable of Levan, Utah and as Justice of the Peace in Naples, Utah.\n\nMembers of Earl's family include his grand uncle Ephraim Roberts who was a pony express rider, and grand uncle William Lance who was a soldier in the Mormon Battalion - Army of the West 1846-1848. Noted Bascom relatives include mountain man Jedediah S. Smith, U.S. army Lt. George N. Bascom who instigated the Apache Wars in 1861, and cattle rancher Bryant Brooks who served as governor of Wyoming from 1905 to 1911.\n\nBascom's paternal ancestors include Minne-tin-ka, of the Turtle Clan, daughter of Chief Miantonomo of the Narragansett Indian tribe, King Edward III of European Royalty, and others from England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Belgium and France with ethnicities including Quaker, French Basque and Huguenot. Bascom's maternal family was of Norwegian, Danish, Dutch and German ancestry.\n\nIn 1909, Earl and his two older brothers and their father were riding horseback near Lybbert Gulch, when a bee stung Earl's horse and it bucked across the meadow with him. Earl hung on until his brothers rode in and picked him off the horse like a rodeo pickup man. Earl was just three years old. For entertainment, the Bascom boys rode anything on the ranch that \"bucked, jumped, or crawled.\" The family was at the local Vernal rodeo where they saw the famous bucking horse \"Steamboat\" in the arena.\n\nIn 1912, when Earl Bascom was just six years old, his mother Rachel died of breast cancer, leaving five children - Raymond, Melvin, Earl, Alice and Weldon - ranging in age from 11 years to nine months. In 1913, Earl's father, who had cowboyed in Utah and Colorado and worked on ranches in Idaho, Wyoming and Montana, went to Alberta, Canada securing a job as a foreman on the Knight Ranch. John Bascom's brother-in-law, Ike Lybbert, was already working there as the Knight Ranch blacksmith and farrier.\n\nIn 1914, the Bascom family loaded their belongings into a covered wagon, traveled a week to the nearest railroad in Price, Utah and rode the train to Canada. After working for the Knight Ranches headquartered on the Milk River Ridge in Alberta, Canada and managing Ray Knight's Butte Ranch north of the town of Raymond, Alberta, John W. Bascom and his sons began ranching on their own using the Bar-B-3 brand. Over the following years, the Bascom family lived at Welling Station and ranched along Pot Hole Creek, at New Dayton on the Fort Whoop-up Trail near Deadman Coulee and ran cattle on the open range, at Lethbridge on the Old Man River, and at Stirling east of Nine Mile Lake.\n\nBy Canadian law, all minor children who emigrated to Canada before 1915 and whose parent became a naturalized citizen, automatically became Canadian citizens. Earl Bascom's father became a naturalized Canadian citizen. Earl Bascom was technically an American Canadian. During the winter of 1916, the Bascom family moved back to Naples, Utah, returning to Canada in the spring of 1917.\n\nSchooled mostly in one-room schools, Bascom quit school while in grade three to work on the Hyssop 5H Ranch, east of Lethbridge. It was not long before a Canadian Mountie, who was visiting the Hyssop Ranch, thought that one of the cowboys was just too young looking to be a seasoned cowpuncher and bronc peeler. The Mountie asked Earl Bascom just how old he was - he was 13 years old. Earl was returned to school. Attending school felt better after Earl's father, who had a school district transportation contract, gave him the job of driving an old stagecoach pulled by a team of Bascom horses each day to the surrounding ranches transporting fellow students to and from school.\n\nIn 1918, Bascom gained a stepmother and a stepbrother, Frank, when his Earl's father married Ada Romeril Dawley. To this new union was born five more children - Ada Bell, Charles, Luella, Grant and LaMona - making a total of eleven children in the Bascom family.\n\nBascom was known as the Cowboy of Cowboy Artists due to his wide range of western experiences as a professional bronc buster, bull rider, cowpuncher, trail driver, blacksmith, freighter, wolf hunter, wild horse chaser, rodeo champion, cattle rancher, dude wrangler, and Hollywood actor. Bascom was among the last of those who experienced the Old West before the end of free-range ranching. Bascom reminisced:\n\nFor Bascom, ranch life and cowboy life was his life. \"The life of a cowboy and the West, I know,\" he stated. Bascom worked on some of the largest horse and cattle ranches in the United States and Canada — ranches that ran thousands of cattle on a million acres (4000 km²) of land. He broke and trained hundreds of horses. He worked on ranches where he chased and gathered horses, cows and even donkeys in Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, Mississippi, Washington, California and western Canada. He worked on cattle drives out of the Rockies and horse drives through the Teton Range. He took part on large roundups of horses and cattle, and brandings. He made saddles and stirrups, quirts, chaps, spurs, bridles and bits, ropes and hackamores, and even patched his own boots. Earl's brothers and their father, John W. Bascom, were all experienced ranch hands and professional horsemen who were known as the \"Bronc Bustin' Bascom Boys.\"\n\nA professional rodeo cowboy, Bascom followed the rodeo circuit internationally, rodeoing from 1916 to 1940, where he won several all-around championships. He competed in the rough stock events of saddle bronc riding, bareback riding and bull riding, and in the timed events of steer decorating and steer wrestling. In 1933, he set a new arena record, a new world record time and won third place in the world standings in the steer decorating event. He also was a rodeo announcer, performed trick riding and competed in the rodeo events of wild cow milking and wild horse racing. He held memberships in the Cowboys Turtle Association, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, the Canadian Rodeo Cowboys Association (now the Canadian Pro Rodeo Association), the National Police Rodeo Association and the National Old Timers Rodeo Association (now the National Senior Pro Rodeo Association). Earl Bascom was a life-member of the Rodeo Historical Society and a founding member of the Canadian Rodeo Historical Association.\n\nBascom has been inducted into several rodeo, cowboy and sports Halls of Fame in Canada and the United States. He received international publicity for his rodeo equipment inventions and designs. Earl's brothers - Raymond \"Tommy\" Bascom, Melvin \"High Pockets\" Bascom and Weldon \"Preacher\" Bascom, along with their father John W. Bascom - were also professional rodeo cowboys and Hall of Fame inductees. Rodeoing financed Earl Bascom's college education at Brigham Young University where he was given the title of \"Rodeo's First Collegiate Cowboy\" and from which institution he graduated in 1940.\n\nBascom has been honored as the \"Father of Modern Rodeo\" and known as an innovator and inventor. He is known in rodeo history for designing and making rodeo's modern bucking chute in 1916 and modified in 1919. He also made rodeo's first hornless bronc saddle in 1922 and rodeo's first one-hand bareback rigging in 1924, for which he has been called the \"Father of Rodeo Bareback Riding.\" In 1926, he designed and made the modern rodeo riding chaps, and then in 1928, a rodeo exerciser made of spring steel. Bascom has been recognized as one of rodeo's greatest inventors.\n\nDuring his college years, Earl and his brother Weldon produced the first rodeos in Columbia, Mississippi in 1935, 1936 and 1937 while working for Sam Hickman's B Bar H Ranch near Arm, Mississippi. This first rodeo in Columbia is known in cowboy history as the first rodeo held outdoors at night under electric lights. The rodeo arena designed and built under the direction of Earl Bascom in 1936, was the first permanent rodeo arena built in Mississippi.\n\nThe bucking horses used in the rodeo were shipped in from West Texas. Sam Hickman and Earl Bascom went to New Orleans where they purchased brahma bulls for the rodeo bucking stock. This was the first recorded use of brahma bulls in rodeo. Sam Hickman financed these rodeos through his Wild West Rodeo Company.\n\nBetween rodeos of 1936 and 1937, Earl was a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Mississippi, serving under Mission President LeGrand Richards of the Southern States Mission. The Bascom brothers were honored fifty years later for being the \"Fathers of Mississippi Rodeo\" and given the \"Key to the City of Columbia,\" along with a congratulatory telegram from President Ronald Reagan. In 2016, Earl Bascom and his brother Weldon were officially recognized by the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame as the \"Fathers of Brahma Bull Riding.\"\n\nIn 1939, Bascom married Nadine Diffey, who was part American Indian, Creek and Catawba. He met her in Mississippi while cowboying and rodeoing there. They were married in Salt Lake City, Utah in the Salt Lake LDS Temple, and raised five children. Later in life, Nadine Bascom became a sculptor in her own right, creating bas-relief sculptures.\n\nBesides being a professional rodeo contestant, Bascom tried his hand as a rodeo clown and rodeo bullfighter during his rodeo career. Just after his 89th birthday, Earl was honored as the oldest living rodeo clown in the world.\n\nAt the age of 88, Bascom helped roundup longhorn steers on the Shahan Ranch in west Texas and received honors for his art during the 1994 Texas Longhorn Quincentennial Cattle Drive and Celebration. Bascom's bronze sculpture \"The American Longhorn, 1494-1994\" was declared the most authentic example of a classical Texas longhorn steer.\n\nIn 2014, Bascom was honored posthumously during the tenth anniversary celebration of the National Day of the Cowboy, for his international contributions to cowboy culture and the cowboy way of life.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Bascom personally knew and associated with such characters as old time cowboys, pioneers and homesteaders, outlaws and lawmen, gunslingers and bootleggers, prospectors and gold miners, Mormon Battalion soldiers and Civil War soldiers, Indian Chiefs and Indian War fighters, muleskinners and pony express riders, squatters and sheepherders, cattle rustlers and horse thieves.\n\nWhile working for the Nilsson Rafter-E-N Ranch, Bascom happened to read a story in a western magazine about Native American Jim Thorpe. Thorpe had been working as a horse wrangler, but got fired. The camp cook gave him some advice - go to school. Thorpe took that advice, went to school, excelled in sports and became an Olympic champion.\n\nJim Thorpe's life touched Bascom. \"I felt like I had walked in his boots,\" Earl said. \"Like Jim Thorpe, cowboy life was the only life that I knew. But what about my art, what about art school?\"\n\nWanting to be an artist since childhood, Bascom filled the pages of his school books in the one-room school house he attended with cowboy scenes. His desire to be a cowboy artist was greatly enhanced after seeing art works of the two great icons of Old West art, Charles M. Russell and Frederic S. Remington - both cousins to his father, John W. Bascom (Remington and Russell were both related to Bascom through their mothers, Clarissa \"Clara\" Bascom Sackrider Remington and Mary Elizabeth Mead Russell, respectively). Both Remington and Russell were artists that spent time in Canada producing art. In the late 1920s, Earl worked on a ranch south of the Sweetgrass Hills in Montana that was once owned by the artist Charlie Russell and only a few months after Russell's death.\n\nRussell was on the Knight Ranch when Bascom was working there, and had drawn a sketch on the bunkhouse wall and also finished a large oil painting of Raymond Knight on his favorite mount, Blue Bird, roping a steer.\n\nAlthough Bascom was educated in one-room school houses and only completed one full school year, never finishing high school, he never lost his desire to be an artist. He subscribed to a correspondence art course wherein both Russell and Remington gave instructions on their drawing techniques. \"Through those art lessons these two masters of western art were my first real art teachers,\" Bascom recalled. \"In fact the only instructions I ever had in western art were from Remington and Russell.\"\n\nEven though he had no high school diploma, the Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah accepted him as a student in the fall of 1933. \"There I was a 27 years old college freshman who hadn’t been to school in years,\" Bascom recalled. \"I felt like a wild horse in a pen.\" But as a BYU student, he was persistence, taking every art course the college offered. He studied painting and drawing under professors E.H. Eastmond and B.F. Larsen, and sculpture under Torleif S. Knaphus.\n\nIn the summertime between school years, Bascom was a rodeo contestant where he gained notoriety as a cowboy artist and rodeo champion. He interrupted his college education in 1934 with the intent to compete at the World Championship Rodeo in London, England.\n\nDuring his freshman year of 1933-34, Bascom won the Studio Guild Award for the best student art work of the year. He won that top art award again in 1936, as well as the Honorable Mention Award. He was a member of the BYU Art Club and the Canada Club as well as the Delta Phi fraternity. He was a popular entertainer with his cartoon drawings at the University Dames Club of which his wife Nadine was a member. He graduated from BYU with a degree in Fine Art in 1940. His fellow art students voted him \"most likely to succeed\" as an artist. He was a member of the Brigham Young University Alumni Association and elected to the BYU Emeritus Club in 1990.\n\nLater he attended classes at Long Beach City College, Victor Valley College and the University of California Riverside.\n\nIn 1917, Bascom saw his first Hollywood movie \"The Silent Man\" starring William S. Hart. Earl and his older brother Melvin were extras in a silent movie in 1920 being filmed in Lethbridge, Alberta. In 1924, a team of palomino horses from the Bascom Ranch was used by Hoot Gibson in a Roman race in the movie \"The Calgary Stampede\". Earl later worked in the movie industry with his brother Weldon Bascom in the 1954 Hollywood western, \"The Lawless Rider\", starring Weldon's wife Texas Rose Bascom. Earl was one of the outlaws in the movie. Weldon was the sheriff and one of the stuntmen.\n\nBascom worked as a miner in the Old Gray Mine, digging coal, near Maeser, Utah in the winter of 1930.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Bascom and his wife moved to Southgate, California. Retiring from rodeo after one last season, he pursued his art career and ranched. Earl Bascom and his brother Weldon Bascom worked on a ranch in Perris, California which was formerly owned by Louis B. Mayer of Hollywood's MGM Studios. Earl worked on the Rex Ellsworth Ranch in Chino, California. Earl was a distant cousin on the Bascom side to Mitch Tenney who was Ellsworth's horse trainer. Earl worked on Al Hamblin's Flying V Ranch in the Beaumont area. Earl had his own cattle ranch in Ontario in San Bernardino Valley using the Two Bar Quarter Circle brand, before moving to the high desert, living in Hesperia, Apple Valley and Victorville. His Diamond B Ranch on the Mojave River had buildings dating from the 1870s and was once the temporary resident of Albert Einstein in the mid 1930s.\n\nDuring World War II, Bascom worked as a shipfitter in the Long Beach shipyards building ships for the war effort. He attended Long Beach City College, taking a class on blueprint reading in order to qualify for the job at the shipyard. As such, he was a member of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers. After the war, Bascom worked for the Flying V Ranch before entering the home construction industry, first working in the plumbing trade and then the plastering trade, joining what is known today as the Operative Plasterers' and Cement Masons' International Association of the United States and Canada. As a plastering contractor, he plastered houses in some of the first residential tracts in southern California. He plastered California Mormon churches in Chino, Ontario, Palmdale, Ridgecrest, Trona, Hesperia and Victorville. Bascom's most ornate plastering work was on the Los Angeles Mormon Temple, wherein his former art professor Torleif Knaphus sculpted the twelve oxen that hold up the baptistery.\n\nLater, Earl Bascom and his son-in-law Mel Marion worked with Roy Rogers being filmed for TV commercials for the Roy Rogers Restaurant chain. The restaurant chain was then owned by the Marriott Corporation. When the Roy Rogers Riding Stables operated in Apple Valley, California, managed by Mel Marion and later Billy Bascom, Earl and his son John worked there wrangling horses and driving the hay wagon.\n\nEarl and his son John were in the television documentary \"Take Willy With Ya\", a tribute to the life of rodeo champion Turk Greenough and his rodeo riding siblings and family members.\n\nIn 1966, after getting his teaching certificate from Brigham Young University and teaching art classes as a student teacher at the Springville (Utah) High School held in the Springville Art Museum, Bascom taught high school art classes in Barstow, California at John F. Kennedy High School and at Barstow High School. He also served as president of the High Desert Artists (now Artists of the High Desert), and later as president of the Buckaroo Artists of America.\n\nWith his classic cowboy look and dressed in his authentic cowboy attire, he was a popular art studio model. Other artists who associated with Bascom were Bill Bender, Charles LaMonk, Leslie B. DeMille, Glen Turner, Cecil Smith, Trevor Bennett, Ray Bennett, Hughes Curtis, Pete Plastow and Grant Speed.\n\nEarl Bascom was a published historian with his writings on cowboy and rodeo history printed in books, magazines and newspapers. He was a member of the Western Writers of America association. His first-known published writing was in 1926 for the Cardston newspaper, narrating a week-long trek into the Canadian Rocky Mountains that he and his friends took on horseback and pack horse. He was interviewed on radio and television. He was a popular lecturer on pioneer and cowboy history at schools and other academic centers.\n\nEarl also assisted his nephew Billy Bascom in teaching horsemanship, as well as cowboy and rodeo history at the Victor Valley College in Victorville, California. Earl Bascom was later inducted into the Victor Valley College Alumni Hall of Fame having taken art classes at the college when it first opened.\n\nBascom became internationally known as a cowboy artist and sculptor with his art being exhibited in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia.\n\nIn 1994, Earl Bascom was commissioned by the Texas Longhorn Quincentennial Celebration Committee to produce his sculpture of what was deemed \"the most authentic example of a classical Texas longhorn steer.\"\n\nHe was also commissioned in 1994 to design a collector's series of rodeo cowboy belt buckles for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association's National Finals.\n\nHe was honored by the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Artists Association as the first rodeo cowboy to become a professional cowboy artist and sculptor. He was the first cowboy artist to be honored as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts of London since the society's beginning in 1754.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, the week-long Earl W. Bascom Memorial Rodeo was held in Berlin, Germany during the German-American Heritage Celebration where his cowboy art was exhibited as an honor by the European Rodeo Cowboys Association for Bascom's worldwide influence upon the sport of rodeo. \"It was an honor to memorialize Earl Bascom,\" said Steve Witt, vice-president of European Rodeo Cowboy Association. \"The rodeo equipment he designed back in 1920s has had an influence on rodeo worldwide.\"\n\nEquestrian historian Kathy Young said, \"Earl Bascom was noted for bridging two worlds, that of rodeo competition and western art.\"\n\nOn July 24, 2014, Bascom was made the international honoree of the National Day of the Cowboy and given the \"Cowboy Keeper\" award.\n\nIn June 2015, Bascom was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, as the first rodeo champion ever honored and given Canada's highest sports honor as a \"Canadian Sports Legend.\"\n\n\"As a Canadian rodeo athlete and cowboy artist, Earl Bascom is a national treasure,\" stated Helena Deng, senior curator of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Bascom's incredible achievements are now to be shared with all Canadians in perpetuity,\" said Mario Siciliano, president of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, \"inspiring generations of Canadians in sports and in life.\"\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives honored Earl Bascom as an \"American Hero\" in 1985.\n\nIn 1994, Bascom was commissioned to design a rodeo belt buckle for the National Finals to commemorate the 70th year of the rodeo bareback rigging which Bascom had designed and made back in 1924. The production manager said, \"Bascom's buckle was one of our most popular pieces and the most historical.\"\n\nUnited States Congressman, the Honorable Jerry Lewis, said in 1995 in \"A Tribute to Earl Wesley Bascom\" as printed in the Congressional Record, that Earl Bascom was a \"cowboy hero and a true inspiration...(who) lived one of the most interesting lives ever known in modern cowboy history.\"\n\nPaul de Fonville, curator of the Cowboy Memorial Museum, gave tribute to Earl Bascom as \"one of the great pioneers of rodeo - a cowboy through and through.\"\n\nThe \"American Cowboy\" magazine and others have called Earl Bascom a \"Renaissance Cowboy\" - one who was a main contributor and participant in the renewed interest in cowboy life including the sport of rodeo and western art.\n\nBascom is listed among the Famous Cowboys - Legends of the Old West.\n\nCowboy celebrity Roy Rogers, who worked with Earl Bascom in TV commercials and was a collector of Bascom art, once said, \"Earl Bascom is a walking book of history. His knowledge of the Old West was acquired the old fashioned way – he was born and raised in it.\"\n\n\"Earl Bascom's 2013 induction into the Rodeo Hall of Fame is one of the top honors bestowed upon a cowboy,\" said Pam Minick, president of the Rodeo Historical Society. He is credited with designing the first side-delivery bucking chute in 1916, and then the first reverse-opening side-delivery chute, the first hornless bronc saddle, and the first one-hand bareback rigging. A member of the Cowboys' Turtle Association, he won bareback and saddle bronc titles across North America.\"\n\nEarl Bascom was honored as the 2014 International Honoree of the National Day of the Cowboy with these words - \"As a rodeo pioneer, an all-around champion, an internationally known artist and a cowboy, Earl W. Bascom has been inducted into more halls of fame than any cowboy in the world.\"\n\n\"The Guide to the Calgary Stampede\" published, \"With the induction of Earl W. Bascom in 2015, Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame welcomed its first Honoured Member known for Rodeo. With the help of innovators like Bascom, the modernised version of the sport features new methods and equipment which helped shape the face and spirit of the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth (the Calgary Stampede).\"\n\nIn 2016, Earl Bascom and his brother Weldon were the first rodeo cowboys to be given the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame Ken Stemler Pioneer Award. At hall of fame ceremonies, director Kent Sturman declared Earl Bascom to be a \"true rodeo pioneer.\" He recognized Bascom for \"his complete dedication to the sport of professional rodeo spanning several decades; for his contributions as a rodeo equipment and gear inventor and designer; for his innovation and foresight as the ‘Father of Modern Rodeo’ and the ‘Father of Brahma Bull Riding’; and for his contributions as a rodeo athlete and champion, producer, stock contractor, announcer, clown, trick rider, historian, author, artist and sculptor, and western movie actor that helped advance the development and success of professional rodeo.\"\n\n\"Earl Bascom is the Michael Phelps of rodeo,\" stated Ken Knopp, historian of the Mississippi Rodeo Hall of Fame. \"With a stack of honors to his name, Bascom remains the all-time leader in the sport of rodeo.\" Bascom and Phelps are actually distant cousins, both being descendants of New England founder Thomas Newell and Rebecca Olmstead.\n\nCowboy historian Stan Paregien said, \"Earl Bascom was one of the last great cowboys of the Old West era and became internationally known for his western art and sculpture, as well as for his rodeo equipment designs and inventions.\"\n\nAuthor of \"Rodeo History and Legends\", Bob Jordan, said - \"The Bascom boys helped shape the sport of rodeo more than any other family in the world.\"\n\nEarl Bascom was chosen by the \"Toronto Star\" as one of 150 of Canada's greatest athletes, including Wayne Gretsky and Steve Nash, to represent Canada during its 150th year (1867-2017) of Confederation. Sports writer Kerry Gillespie wrote, \"Angry bulls to wild horses, there wasn't anything on four legs that Earl Bascom couldn't get the better of...\"\n\nThe Cardston Historical Society recorded, \"Earl Bascom and his brothers designed and built the first side-delivery bucking chute on the Bascom Ranch at Welliing Station. In 1922, Earl made a hornless rodeo saddle, which the cowboys called the \"mulee\", and first used it at the Cardston Stampede. Bascom's rodeo innovations helped change rodeo from a cowboy's pastime to an international sport and placed him 0n the list of Canada's most famous inventors.\"\n\nWyoming radio personality Rich Roddam named Earl Bascom in 2018 as one of 13 famous people from small Wyoming towns - \"In a state full of cowboys, Earl Bascom may have been the best. Considered the \"Father of Modern Rodeo\", Bascom gained fame as an actor, artist, inventor, and writer.\"\n\nBascom is known as an innovator and designer of rodeo equipment and rodeo gear. His inventions include:\n\n"}
{"id": "719365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=719365", "title": "Family as a model for the state", "text": "Family as a model for the state\n\nThe family as a model for the organization of the state is a theory of political philosophy. It either explains the structure of certain kinds of state in terms of the structure of the family (as a model or as a claim about the historical growth of the state), or it attempts to justify certain types of state by appeal to the structure of the family. The first writer to use it (certainly in any clear and developed way) was Aristotle, who argued that the natural progression of human beings was from the family via small communities to the polis.\n\nMany writers from ancient times to the present have seen parallels between the family and the forms of the state. In particular, monarchists have argued that the state mirrors the patriarchal family, with the people obeying the king as children obey their father.\n\nThe family–state model was first expressed in ancient times, often as a form of justification for aristocratic rule.\n\nPlutarch records a laconic saying of the Dorians attributed to Lycurgus. Asked why he didn't establish a democracy in the Lacedæmon, Lycurgus responded: “Begin, friend, and set it up in your family”. The Dorians of Crete and Sparta seemed to mirror the family institution and organization in their form of government. (see Plutarch's \"The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans\" — Lycurgus, p. 65)\n\nAristotle often describes personal and domestic relationships in terms of different forms of government. He gives examples such as men and their domestic animals, wives, slaves, and children. He says, for example: “the government of a household is a monarchy, since every house is governed by a single ruler”.(2) Later in the same text he says that husbands exercise a republican government over their wives and monarchical government over their children, and that they exhibit political office over slaves and royal office over the family in general. (\"Politics\" Bk I, §v, 1–2; 1259a 35–1259b 1)\n\nHowever, while he is prepared to use political terms as metaphors for domestic relationships, he is equally clear that such metaphors are limited:\nAfter discussing the various domestic relationships, he concludes: “mastership and statesmanship are not identical, nor are all forms of power the same, as some thinkers suppose.” (\"Politics\" Bk I, §vi)\n\nAristotle's main notion is that the ancient Greek \"polis\" or city-state is the natural end of human beings; they start in family groups, progress naturally to forming villages, and finally come together in cities. Thus the family forms the root of human relationships, but the city is the flower.\n\nArius Didymus in Stobaeus, 1st century CE, writes: “A primary kind of association (politeia) is the legal union of a man and woman for begetting children and for sharing life.” From the collection of households a village is formed and from villages a city, “<nowiki>[s]</nowiki>o just as the household yields for the city the seeds of its formation, thus it yields the constitution (politeia)”. Further, he claims: “Connected with the house is a pattern of monarchy, of aristocracy and of democracy. The relationship of parents to children is monarchic, of husbands to wives aristocratic, of children to one another democratic.” (\"Hellenistic Commentary to the New Testament\", edd Boring, Berger, & Colpe)\n\nConfucius believed the child should be subordinate to the parent, younger brother to the older, wife to husband, and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the father of the nation. The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government. This was later expanded to cover international relations (e.g. the emperor of China is treated as the older brother of the Korean king). Confucian family theory is still espoused in North Korea to justify their method of leadership succession.\n\nThe concept of family is important in classical Confucianism. For Confucius, \"xiào\" or filial piety was a \"dé\" or virtue. The character representing \"xiào\", 孝, itself represents a basic family structure, with the upper component representing elders (\"lao\", old), and the lower representing children (\"zi\", son). Those acting with filial piety, such as through the performances of \"lĭ\" were therefore acting in accordance with \"yì\" (righteousness, or fulfilling one's proper roles or acting in harmony with one's station). The relationship of this concept to the state is discussed at length in the \"Xiàojīng\", or Classic of Filial Piety. In politics, \"xiào\" is not simply loyalty on the part of subordinates and citizens, but also an expectation for the king to provide for his subjects with \"paternal love\"; just as the people were expected to act with respect for the king's law, the king was expected to make those laws out of kindness for the people. \n\nAmerican diplomat Edmund Roberts in his description of Canton City, which he visited in 1832, included a quote on this, for which he gives no source, but which was subsequently include in latter 18th-century publications, again without a source:The sovereign of men, say they, \"is heaven's son; nobles and statesmen are the sovereign's children; the people are the children of nobles and statesmen. The sovereign should serve heaven as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, but exciting himself to illustrate his virtues, and looking up to receive from heaven, the vast patrimony which it confers; thus the emperors will daily increase in felicity and glory. Nobles and ministers of state should serve their sovereign as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, not harbouring covetous and sordid desires, nor engaging in wicked and clandestine thoughts, but faithfully and justly exerting themselves; thus their noble rank will be preserved. The people should never forget to cherish reverential thoughts towards the nobles and ministers of state, to obey and keep the laws; to excite no secret or open rebellion; then no great calamity will befall their persons.\"\n\nLouis de Bonald wrote as if the family were a miniature state. In his analysis of the family relationships of father, mother and child, De Bonald related these to the functions of a state: the father is the power, the mother is the minister and the child as subject. As the father is “active and strong” and the child is “passive or weak”, the mother is the “median term between the two extremes of this continuous proportion”. De Bonald justified his analysis by quoting and interpreting passages from the Bible:\n\nDe Bonald also sees divorce as the first stage of disorder in the state (the principle of macrocosm/microcosm). He insists that the \"deconstitution\" of the family brings about the deconstitution of state, with “The Kyklos” not far behind. (\"On Divorce\", pp 88–89; 149.)\n\nErik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn draws a connection between the family and monarchy:\n\nIn her book, \"Delacroix, Art and Patrimony in Post-Revolutionary France\", Elisabeth Fraser analyses Eugène Delacroix's famous “Massacres of Chios” (1824), which helped galvanise philo-Hellenism in France. Delacroix's symbol for the oppressed Greek nation was a family employed as a conceptual and visual structuring device. A reviewer encapsulated Fraser's argument:\n\nMore recently, George Lakoff has claimed that the left/right distinction in politics comes from a difference between ideals of the family in the mind of the person in question; for right-wing people, the ideal is a patriarchical and moralistic family; for left-wing people, the ideal is an unconditionally loving family. As a result, Lakoff argues, both sides find each other's views not only immoral, but incomprehensible, since they appear to violate each side's deeply held beliefs about personal morality in the sphere of the family..\n\nSuch a model is not a recent addition to modern discourse; J. Vernon Jenson discussed “British Voices on the Eve of the American Revolution: Trapped by the Family Metaphor” in the \"Quarterly Journal of Speech\" 63 (1977), pp 43–50.\n\nThe idea of the commonwealth as a family is close to cliché; it permeates political discourse at every level:\n\n\n\n"}

This rectification movement led to the reestablishment of the Communist Party of the Philippines on December 26, 1968 along Marxist–Leninist–Maoist Thought.\n\nThe Communist Party of the Philippines (Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas - PKP) was established on November 7, 1930 guided by Marxist–Leninist Thought. During World War II, the Hukbalahap under Luis Taruc and Vicente Lava was organized under PKP leadership with the aim of resisting the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. After the Second World War ended, the PKP found itself in a considerably strengthened position in the working class and peasant movements.\n\nIn 1948, the PKP began an armed struggle against the Philippine government, turning the Hukbalahap into a People's Liberation Army. However, in 1950, the entire secretariat of the Central Committee of the PKP was arrested, including General Secretary Jose Lava, following the earlier capture of the Politburo in Manila. In the course of the armed struggle, the PKP and the People's Liberation Army sustained heavy losses. By the end of 1954 the armed struggle was effectively over. The PKP then pursued a course of peaceful action.\n\nJose Maria Sison was a graduate student and teacher at the University of the Philippines Diliman when he joined the \"Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas\" in 1962 upon the invitation of Jesus Lava. In due course, he joined a five-man committee tasked with reviving the party and organizing a youth movement. Using the nom de guerre \"Amado Guerrero\", Sison co-founded the \"Kabataang Makabayan\" (\"Patriotic Youth\") with Nilo Tayag in 1964. This organization rallied the Filipino youth against the Vietnam War, the Marcos presidency and corrupt politicians. It was involved in the period of civil unrest during the 1970s called the First Quarter Storm.\n\nInfluenced by the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966, Sison created a youth-based Maoist group within the PKP. The Lavas however, became discomfited by Sison's growing popularity within the PKP. When Sison wrote a draft of the party's history, they pressured him to shelf the document for future discussion when it turned out to be a \"powerful indictment of the Lavas' history of incompetence since World War II.\" Sison's aim to continue the armed struggle clashed with the party leaders' view that armed struggle was an exercise in futility. Consequently, Sison and his group were expelled from the PKP in 1967.\nOn December 26, 1968, Sison and ten of his companions met in Alaminos, Pangasinan and formed the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founded on Marxist–Leninist–Maoist Thought. The revised historical report on the PKP now had a new title, \"Rectify Errors and Rebuild the Party\"; it was adopted as a founding document. This came to be known as the \"First Great Rectification Movement\". The reformed Communist Party included Maoism within the political ideology as well as a two-stage revolution consisting of a protracted people's war to be followed by a Socialist revolution. The PKP leadership sought to eliminate and marginalize Sison. However, over time, Sison's bloc became the leading communist party in the Philippines.\n\n"}

{"id": "5176690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5176690", "title": "History of Danish", "text": "History of Danish\n\nThe Danish language developed during the Middle Ages out of the Old East Norse, the common predecessor of Danish and Swedish. It was a late form of common Old Norse. The Danish philologist Johannes Brøndum-Nielsen divided the history of Danish into \"Old Danish\" from 800 AD to 1525 and \"Modern Danish\" from 1525 and onwards. He subdivided Old Danish into \"Runic Danish\" (800–1100), Early Middle Danish (1100–1350) and Late Middle Danish (1350–1525).\n\nOld East Norse is in Sweden called \"Runic Swedish\" and in Denmark \"Runic Danish\", but until the 12th century, the dialect was the same in the two countries. The dialects are called \"runic\" because the main body of text appears in the runic alphabet. Unlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the Elder Futhark alphabet, Old Norse was written with the Younger Futhark alphabet, which only had 16 letters. Due to the limited number of runes, some runes were used for a range of phonemes, such as the rune for the vowel \"u\" which was also used for the vowels \"o\", \"ø\" and \"y\", and the rune for \"i\" which was also used for \"e\".\n\nA change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the diphthong \"æi\" (Old West Norse \"ei\") to the monophthong \"e\", as in \"stæin\" to \"sten\". This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read \"stain\" and the later \"stin\". There was also a change of \"au\" as in \"dauðr\" into \"ø\" as in \"døðr\". This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from \"tauþr\" into \"tuþr\". Moreover, the \"øy\" (Old West Norse \"ey\") diphthong changed into \"ø\" as well, as in the Old Norse word for \"island\".\n\nFrom 1100 and onwards, the dialect of Denmark began to diverge from that of Sweden. The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries, isoglosses, ranging from Zealand to Svealand.\nIn the medieval period Danish emerged as a separate language from Swedish. The main written language was Latin, and the few Danish language texts preserved from this period are written in the Latin alphabet, although the runic alphabet seems to have lingered in popular usage in some areas. The main text types written in this period are laws, which were formulated in the vernacular language to be accessible also to those who were not Latinate. The Jutlandic Law and Scanian Law were written in vernacular Danish in the early 13th century. Beginning in 1350, Danish began to be used as a language of administration and new types of literature began to be written in the language, such as royal letters and testaments. The orthography in this period was not standardized nor was the spoken language, and the regional laws demonstrate the dialectal differences between the regions in which they were written. Throughout this period, Danish was in contact with Low German, and many Low German loan words were introduced.\n\nWith the Protestant Reformation in 1536, Danish also became the language of religion, which sparked a new interest in using Danish as a literary language. It is also in this period that Danish begins to take on the linguistic traits that differentiate it from Swedish and Norwegian, such as the stød and the voicing of many stop consonants.\n\nThe first printed book in Danish dates from 1495, \"Rimkrøniken\" (the Rhyming Chronicle), a history book told in rhymed verses. The first complete translation of the Bible in Danish, the Bible of Christian II translated by Christiern Pedersen was published in 1550. Pedersen's orthographic choices set the de facto standard for subsequent writing in Danish.\n\nThe first translation of the Bible in Danish was published in 1550.\n\nSome notable authors of works in Danish are existential philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, prolific fairy tale author Hans Christian Andersen, and playwright Ludvig Holberg. Three 20th century Danish authors have become Nobel Prize laureates in Literature: Karl Adolph Gjellerup and Henrik Pontoppidan (joint recipients in 1917) and Johannes Vilhelm Jensen (awarded 1944).\n"}
{"id": "50675794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50675794", "title": "History of hermeneutics", "text": "History of hermeneutics\n\nHermeneutics is the theory and methodology of interpretation. The tradition of Western hermeneutics starts in the writings of Aristotle and continues to the modern era.\n\nIn \"De Interpretatione\", Aristotle offers a theory which lays the groundwork for many later theories of interpretation and semiotics:\n\nEqually important to later developments are some ancient texts on poetry, rhetoric, and sophistry:\nHowever, these texts deal with the presentation and refutation of arguments, speeches, and poems rather than with the understanding of texts \"per se\". As Ramberg and Gjesdal note, \"Only with the Stoics, and their reflections on the interpretation of myth, do we encounter something like a methodological awareness of the problems of textual understanding.\"\n\nSome ancient Greek philosophers, particularly Plato, vilified poets and poetry as harmful nonsense. In \"The Republic\", Plato denied poets entry into his \"ideal state\" until they could prove their value. In \"Ion\", Plato famously portrayed poets as possessed:\n\nThe meaning of the poem thus becomes open to ridicule. Whatever hints of truth it may have, the truth is covered up by madness. However, another line of thinking arose with Theagenes of Rhegium, who suggested that, instead of taking poetry literally, it ought to be taken as allegories of nature. Stoic philosophers further developed this idea, reading into poetry both allegories of nature and allegories of ethical behavior.\n\nAristotle differed with his predecessor, Plato, about the worth of poetry. Both saw art as an act of mimesis, but where Plato saw a pale, essentially false, imitation of reality, Aristotle saw the possibility of truth in imitation. As critic David Richter points out, \"For Aristotle, artists must disregard incidental facts to search for deeper universal truths.\" Thus, instead of being essentially false, poetry may be universally true.\n\nThe earliest Christian period of biblical interpretation was the Apostolic Age. Traditionally, that was the period of the Twelve Apostles, dating from the Great Commission until the death of John the Apostle (about 100 ). Because John lived so long and was the last of the apostles to die, there is some overlap between the Apostolic Age and the first Apostolic Fathers. (See Deaths of the Twelve Apostles.)\n\nThe operative hermeneutical principle in the New Testament was \"prophecy fulfillment\". The Gospels, particularly the Gospel of Matthew, make extensive use of the Old Testament for the purpose of demonstrating that Jesus was the Messiah. Examples include Matthew 1:23, 2:15–18, 3:3, 21:42, Mark 1:2–3, 4:12, Luke 3:4–6, 22:37, John 2:17, 12:15, and notably Luke 4:18–21. Jesus read extensively from Book of Isaiah and said that the prophecy was fulfilled in the crowds who heard it. The Pauline epistles also employ the principle of prophecy fulfillment, as evidenced by 1 Corinthians 1:19 and Ephesians 4:8–10.\n\nThe Apostolic Fathers were followers of the Apostles. This period is sometimes called the sub-apostolic period.\n\nThe principle of prophecy fulfillment was carried over from the Apostolic Age and was continued up to the beginning of the 3rd century For example, Irenaeus dedicates an entire chapter of \"Against Heresies\" to the defense of , which was one of the chief prophecies used to validate Jesus as the Messiah.  This is consistent with Irenaeus' other writings.\n\nEven more than Irenaeus, the second century apologists tended to interpret and utilize most scripture as if it were primarily for the purpose of showing prophecy fulfillment. Prominent among these was Justin Martyr, who made extensive use of scripture to this end. Examples of prophecy fulfillment can be seen in his \"Apology\", in which chapters 31–53 are specifically dedicated to proving through prophecy that Jesus was the Messiah. He uses scripture similarly in \"Dialogue with Trypho\".\n\nHere Justin demonstrates that prophecy fulfillment supersedes logical context in hermeneutics. He ignores the Christological issues that arise from equating Jesus with the golden calf of Bethel, which is the \"him\" that is being brought to the king in .\n\nIt is likely that the preeminence of prophecy fulfillment was a product of the circumstances of the early church. The primary intent of early authors was a defense of Christianity against attacks from paganism and Judaism, as well as suppressing what were considered to be schismatic or heretical groups. To this end, Martin Jan Mulder suggested that prophecy fulfillment was the primary hermeneutical method because Roman society placed a high value upon both antiquity and oracles. By using the Old Testament (a term linked with supersessionism) to validate Jesus, early Christians sought to tap into both the antiquity of the Jewish scriptures and the oracles of the prophets.\n\nTwo divergent schools of thought emerged during this period, which extends from 200 to the medieval period. Historians divide this period into the Ante-Nicene Period and the First seven Ecumenical Councils.\n\nThe Ante-Nicene Period (literally meaning \"before Nicaea\") of the history of early Christianity extended from the late 1st century to the early 4th century. Its end was marked by the First Council of Nicaea in 325  Christianity during this time was extremely diverse, with many developments that are difficult to trace and follow. There is also a relative paucity of available material, and this period is less studied than the preceding Apostolic Age and the historical ages following it. Nevertheless, this part of Christian history is important because it had a significant effect upon the development of Christianity.\n\nThis era begins with the First Council of Nicaea, which enunciated the Nicene Creed that, in its original form and as modified by the First Council of Constantinople of 381 , was seen as the touchstone of orthodoxy for the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\nThe first seven Ecumenical Councils, from the First Council of Nicaea (325  ) to the Second Council of Nicaea (787  ), represent an attempt to reach an orthodox consensus and to establish a unified Christendom.\n\nThe first scholar to study this time period as a whole was Philip Schaff, who wrote \"The Seven Ecumenical Councils of the Undivided Church\", first published after his death in 1901. The topic is of particular interest to proponents of paleo-orthodoxy, who seek to recover the church as it was before the schisms.\n\nAs early as the third century, Christian hermeneutics began to split into two primary schools: the Alexandrian and the Antiochene.\n\nThe Alexandrian biblical interpretations stressed allegorical readings, often at the expense of the texts' literal meaning. Origen and Clement of Alexandria were two major scholars in this school.\n\nThe Antiochene school stressed the literal and historical meaning of texts. Theodore of Mopsuestia and Diodore of Tarsus were the primary figures in this school.\n\nMedieval Christian biblical interpretations of text incorporated exegesis into a fourfold mode which emphasized the distinction between the letter and the spirit of the text. This schema was based on the various ways of interpreting text that were utilized by the patristic writers.\nBiblical hermeneutics in the Middle Ages witnessed the proliferation of nonliteral interpretations of the Bible. Christian commentators could read Old Testament narratives simultaneously:\nIn each case, the meaning of the narrative was constrained by imputing a particular intention to the Bible, such as teaching morality. But these interpretive bases were posited by the religious tradition rather than suggested by a preliminary reading of the text.\n\nA similar fourfold mode is found in rabbinic writings. The four categories are:\nIt is uncertain whether the rabbinic categories of interpretation predate those of the patristic version. The medieval period saw the growth of many new categories of rabbinic interpretation and of exegesis of the Torah. Among these were the emergence of Kabbalah and the writings of Maimonides.\n\nThe customary medieval exegetical technique commented on the text in \"glossae\" or annotations that were written between the lines or at the side of the text (which was left with wide margins for this purpose). The text might be further commented on in \"scholia\", which are long, exegetical passages, often on a separate page.\n"}
{"id": "23094850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23094850", "title": "History of the Republic of Egypt", "text": "History of the Republic of Egypt\n\nThe history of the Republic of Egypt spans the period of modern Egyptian history from the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 to the present day, which saw the toppling of the monarchy of Egypt and Sudan, the establishment of a presidential republic, and a period of profound economic, and political change in Egypt, and throughout the Arab world. The abolition of a monarchy and aristocracy viewed widely as sympathetic to Western interests, particularly since the ousting of Khedive Isma'il Pasha, over seven decades earlier, helped strengthen the authentically Egyptian character of the republic in the eyes of its supporters. From then until now Egypt has always been an independent country.\n\nEgypt's first four presidents were all drawn from professional military backgrounds, due in large part to the central role of the armed forces of Egypt in the Revolution of 1952, and oversaw authoritarian governments, with varying limits on political participation and freedom of speech. Under Gamal Abdel Nasser, the republic had an Arab socialist government, which changed to a more free market-oriented economy and less-pan-Arab orientation with his successors Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak. In 2011 a revolution calling for more freedom overthrew Mubarak.\n\nOn 22–26 July 1952, the Free Officers, a group of disaffected officers in the Egyptian army founded by Gamal Abdel Nasser, and headed by General Muhammad Naguib, initiated the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 with the overthrowing King Farouk, whom the military blamed for Egypt's poor performance in the 1948 war with Israel and lack of progress in fighting poverty, disease, and illiteracy in Egypt. In the following two years, the Free Officers consolidated power, and, following a brief experiment with civilian rule, abrogated the 1953 constitution, and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953, Muhammad Naguib as Egypt's first President.\n\nWithin six months, all civilian political parties were banned, getting replaced by the \"Liberation Rally\" government party, the elites seeing a need for a \"transitional authoritarianism\" in light of Egypt's poverty, illiteracy and lack of a large middle class. In October and November 1954 the large Islamist Muslim Brotherhood organization was suppressed and President Naguib was ousted and arrested. He was replaced by Nasser. Nasser remained president until his death in 1970.\n\nThe revolutionaries wanted an end to British occupation but did not have a unified ideology or plan for Egypt. One issue that many agreed on was the need for land reform. Less than six percent of Egypt's population owned more than 65% of the land in Egypt, while at the top and less than 0.5% of Egyptians owned more than one-third of all fertile land. the process of land reform began on 11 September 1952, when (among many provisions) a law prohibited ownership of more than 200 feddans of land; limited the rental rate for land; established cooperatives for farmers; minimum wages, etc.\n\nNasser evolved into a charismatic leader, not only of Egypt but of the Arab world, promoting and implementing \"Arab socialism\".\n\nWhen the United States held up military sales in reaction to Egyptian neutrality regarding the Soviet Union, Nasser concluded an arms deal with Czechoslovakia in September 1955. When the US and the World Bank withdrew their offer to help finance the Aswan High Dam in mid-1956, Nasser nationalized the privately owned Suez Canal Company. The crisis that followed, exacerbated by growing tensions with Israel over guerrilla attacks from Gaza and Israeli reprisals, support for the National Liberation Front's war of liberation against the French in Algeria and against Britain's presence in the Arab world, resulted in the invasion of Egypt in October by France, Britain, and Israel.\n\nIn 1958 Egypt joined with the Republic of Syria to form a state called the United Arab Republic. It existed until Syria's secession in 1961, although Egypt continued to be known as the UAR until 1971.\n\nNasser helped establish with India and Yugoslavia the Non-Aligned Movement of developing countries in September 1961, and continued to be a leading force in the movement until his death.\n\nNasser ruled as an autocrat but remained extremely popular within Egypt and throughout the Arab world due to his socialist policies at home and anti-imperialist internationalism in the region. His willingness to stand up to the Western powers and to Israel won him support throughout the region. It was partially to smash Nasser's independence that the United States armed Israel to the teeth in preparation Six Day War in 1967.\n\nIn May 1967, Nasser closed the Straits of Tiran to passage of Israeli ships. On 26 May Nasser declared, \"The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel\". Israel considered the Straits of Tiran closure a \"casus belli\". In the 1967 Six Day War, Israel attacked Egypt after observing Egyptian forces mobilized on Israel's border with Egypt. The Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian armed forces were routed by the Israelis, after Nasser convinced the Syrians and Jordanians to attack Israel. Israel occupied the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, Golan Heights from Syria, and the West Bank from Jordan.\n\nThis defeat was a severe blow to Nasser's prestige at home and abroad. Following the defeat, Nasser made a dramatic offer to resign, which was only retracted in the face of mass demonstrations urging him to stay. The last three years of his control over Egypt were far more subdued.\n\nEducational opportunities were \"dramatically expanded\" after the revolution. The Free Officers pledged to provide free education for all citizens and abolished all fees for public schools. They doubled the Ministry of Education's budget in one decade; government spending on education grew from less than 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1952-53 to more than 5 percent by 1978. Expenditures on school construction increased 1,000 percent between 1952 and 1976, and the total number of primary schools doubled to 10,000. By the mid-1970s, the educational budget represented more than 25 percent of the government's total current budget expenses.\n\nAfter Nasser's death, another of the \"free officers\", then Vice President Anwar el-Sadat, acceded to the office of the Presidency. He was not elected democratically.\n\nIn 1971, Sadat concluded a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union, but a year later he ordered Soviet advisers to leave. Nevertheless, up to 4,000 military Soviet advisers were being shared with Syria, and Soviet engineers continued to maintain Egyptian military radar and equipment during the October War.\n\nIn 1973, Sadat launched the 6 October 1973 war with Israel. Egypt's armed forces achieved initial successes in the Crossing of the Suez Canal and advanced 15 km, reaching the depth of the range of safe coverage of its own air force. \n\nHaving defeated the Israeli forces to this extent, Egyptian forces, rather than advancing under air cover, decided to immediately penetrate further into the Sinai desert. In spite of huge losses they kept advancing, creating the chance to open a gap between army forces. That gap was exploited by a tank division led by Ariel Sharon, and he and his tanks managed to penetrate onto Egyptian soil, reaching Suez City.\n\nIsrael was stunned by the attack but recuperated by infusion of weaponry from the U.S. Arab oil producers announced a boycott of Western backers of Israel: a 5% cut in output, to be followed by reductions every month until Israel had withdrawn from all the occupied territories and the rights of the Palestinians had been restored. A UN resolution supported by the United States and the Soviet Union called for an end to hostilities and for peace talks to begin. For President Anwar Sadat, however, the war was much more a victory than a draw, as the Egyptian successes restored Egyptian pride and led to peace talks with the Israelis and to Egypt regaining the entire Sinai peninsula.\n\nIn foreign relations Sadat also launched momentous change from the Nasser era. President Sadat shifted Egypt from a policy of confrontation with Israel to one of peaceful accommodation through negotiations. Following the Sinai Disengagement Agreements of 1974 and 1975, Sadat created a fresh opening for progress by his dramatic visit to Jerusalem in November 1977. This led to the invitation from President Jimmy Carter of the United States to President Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to enter trilateral negotiations at Camp David.\n\nThe outcome was the historic Camp David accords, signed by Egypt and Israel and witnessed by the US on 17 September 1978. The accords led to the 26 March 1979, signing of the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty, by which Egypt regained control of the Sinai in May 1982. Throughout this period, US–Egyptian relations steadily improved, and Egypt became one of America's largest recipients of foreign aid. Sadat's willingness to break ranks by making peace with Israel earned him the enmity of most other Arab states, however. In 1977, Egypt fought a short border war with Libya.\n\nSadat used his immense popularity with the Egyptian people to try to push through vast economic reforms that ended the socialist controls of Nasserism. Sadat introduced greater political freedom and a new economic policy, the most important aspect of which was the infitah or \"open door\" that relaxed government controls over the economy and encouraged private investment. While the reforms created a wealthy and successful upper class and a small middle class, these reforms had little effect upon the average Egyptian who began to grow dissatisfied with Sadat's rule. In 1977, Infitah policies led to massive spontaneous riots ('Bread Riots') involving hundreds of thousands of Egyptians when the state announced that it was retiring subsidies on basic foodstuffs.\n\nLiberalization also included the reinstitution of due process and the legal banning of torture. Sadat dismantled much of the existing political machine and brought to trial a number of former government officials accused of criminal excesses during the Nasser era. Sadat tried to expand participation in the political process in the mid-1970s but later abandoned this effort. In the last years of his life, Egypt was wracked by violence arising from discontent with Sadat's rule and sectarian tensions, and it experienced a renewed measure of repression including extra judicial arrests.\n\nOn 6 October 1981, President Sadat was assassinated by Islamic extremists. Hosni Mubarak, Vice President since 1975 and air force commander during the October 1973 war, was elected president later that month. He was subsequently \"re-elected\" by referendum for three more 6-year terms, most recently in September 2005, all but the 2005 vote lacking any competing candidate.\n\nMubarak maintained Egypt's commitment to the Camp David peace process, but was able to coax Arab countries into resuming diplomatic relations with Egypt and re-establishing Egypt's position as an Arab leader. Egypt was readmitted to the Arab League in 1989. Egypt also has played a moderating role in such international forums as the UN and the Nonaligned Movement.\nFrom 1991, Mubarak undertook an ambitious domestic economic reform program to reduce the size of the public sector and expand the role of the private sector.\n\nDuring the 1990s, a series of International Monetary Fund arrangements, coupled with massive external debt relief resulting from Egypt's participation in the Gulf War coalition, helped Egypt improve its macroeconomic performance. During the 1990s and 2000s, inflation was lowered from double-digit to single digit rate. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) increased fourfold between 1981 and 2006, from US$1355 in 1981, to US$2525 in 1991, to US$3686 in 2001 and to an estimated US$4535 in 2006. Despite this, most Egyptians suffered a drop in their standard of living.\n\nThere was much less progress in political reform. The November 2000 People's Assembly elections saw 34 members of the opposition win seats in the 454-seat assembly, facing a clear majority of 388 affiliated with the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP). A constitutional amendment in May 2005 changed the presidential election to a multicandidate popular vote rather than a popular validation of a candidate nominated by the People’s Assembly and on 7 September Mubarak was elected for another six-year term with 87 percent of the popular vote, followed by a distant but strong showing by Ayman Nour, leader of the opposition Ghad Party and a well-known rights activist.\nShortly after mounting an unprecedented presidential campaign, Nour was jailed on forgery charges critics called phony; he was released on 18 February 2009. Brotherhood members were allowed to run for parliament in 2005 as independents, garnering 88 seats, or 20 percent of the People’s Assembly.\n\nThe opposition parties have been weak and divided and are not yet credible alternatives to the NDP. The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, remains an illegal organization and may not be recognized as a political party (current Egyptian law prohibits the formation of political parties based on religion). Members are known publicly and openly speak their views. Members of the Brotherhood have been elected to the People's Assembly and local councils as independents. The Egyptian political opposition also includes groups and popular movements such as Kefaya and the April 6 Youth Movement, although they are somewhat less organized than officially registered political parties. Bloggers, or cyberactivists as Courtney C. Radsch termed them, have also played an important political opposition role, writing, organizing, and mobilizing public opposition.\n\nPresident Mubarak had tight, autocratic control over Egypt. A dramatic drop in support for Mubarak, or a dramatic increase in people dissatisfied with his practices and his domestic economic reform program increased with surfacing news about his son Alaa being extremely corrupt and favored in government tenders and privatization. As Alaa started getting out of the picture by 2000, Mubarak’s second son Gamal started rising in the National Democratic Party and succeeded in getting a newer generation of neo-liberals into the party and eventually the government. Gamal Mubarak branched out with a few colleagues to set up Medinvest Associates Ltd., which manages a private equity fund, and to do some corporate finance consultancy work.\n\nBeginning on 25 January 2011, a series of street demonstrations, protests, and civil disobedience acts took place in Egypt, with organizers counting on the Tunisian uprising to inspire the crowds to mobilize. The demonstrations and riots were reported to have started over police brutality, state of emergency laws, unemployment, desire to raise the minimum wage, lack of housing, food inflation, corruption, lack of freedom of speech, and poor living conditions. The protests' main goal at the beginning was mainly to protest against the above-mentioned problems, but due to the reactions of the system which was considered late, inadequate and inconvenient the demonstrations started to develop and evolve so that the goal was to oust President Mubarak's regime. Most observers and analysts noticed a unique feature about the revolution that it did not have any leader and it is a clear example of \"The wisdom of the crowd\". On 11 February 2011, President Mubarak resigned, relinquishing power to an interim military authority. The democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, followed Mubarak's resignation.\n\nThe military provisional government, under Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, initiated reforms. Constitutional referendum was held; a provisional constitution came to force. Parliamentary free elections were held. A constituent assembly, founded on 26 March 2012, started to work for implementing a new constitution. The first free presidential elections were held in March–June 2012, with a runoff between former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik and Muslim Brotherhood parliamentarian Mohamed Morsi. On 24 June 2012, Egypt's election commission announced that Morsi had won the run-off.\n\nOn 8 July 2012, Egypt's new president Mohamed Morsi announced he was overriding the military edict that dissolved the country's elected parliament and he called lawmakers back into session.\n\nOn 10 July 2012, the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt negated the decision by President Mohamed Morsi to call the nation's parliament back into session.\nOn 2 August 2012, Egypt’s Prime Minister Hisham Qandil announced his 35-member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers including four from the influential Muslim Brotherhood, six others and the former military ruler Mohamed Hussein Tantawi as the Defence Minister from the previous Government.\n\nOn 22 November 2012, President Morsi issued a declaration immunizing his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly drafting the new constitution. The declaration also requires a retrial of those accused in the Mubarak-era killings of protesters, who had been acquitted, and extends the mandate of the constituent assembly by two months. Additionally, the declaration authorizes Morsi to take any measures necessary to protect the revolution. Liberal and secular groups previously walked out of the constitutional constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamic practices, while Muslim Brotherhood backers threw their support behind Morsi.\n\nThe move was criticized by Mohamed ElBaradei, the leader of Egypt's Constitution Party, who stated \"Morsi today usurped all state powers & appointed himself Egypt's new pharaoh\" on his Twitter feed. The move led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt. On 5 December 2012, Tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of Egypt's president clashed, hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails and brawling in Cairo's streets, in what was described as the largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the country's revolution. Six senior advisors and three other officials resigned from the government and the country's leading Islamic institution called on Morsi to stem his powers. Protesters also clamored from coastal cities to desert towns.\n\nMorsi offered a \"national dialogue\" with opposition leaders but refused to cancel a 15 December vote on a draft constitution written by an Islamist-dominated assembly that has ignited two weeks of political unrest.\n\nA constitutional referendum was held in two rounds on 15 and 22 December 2012, with 64% support, and 33% against. It was signed into law by a presidential decree issued by Morsi on 26 December 2012.\n\nOn 30 June 2013, on the first anniversary of the election of Morsi, millions of protesters across Egypt took to the streets and demanded the immediate resignation of the president. On 1 July, the Egyptian Armed Forces issued a 48-hour ultimatum that gave the country's political parties until 3 July to meet the demands of the Egyptian people. The presidency rejected the Egyptian Army's 48-hour ultimatum, vowing that the president would pursue his own plans for national reconciliation to resolve the political crisis. On 3 July, General Abdul Fatah al-Sisi, head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, announced that he had removed President Morsi from power, suspended the constitution and would be calling new presidential and Shura Council elections and appointed Supreme Constitutional Court's leader, Adly Mansour as acting president. Mansour was sworn in on 4 July 2013.\n\nDuring the months after the coup d'état, a new constitution was prepared, which took effect on 18 January 2014. After that, presidential and parliamentary elections have to be held within 6 months.\n\nOn 24 March 2014, 529 of Morsi's supporters were sentenced to death.\nOn 28 April, the verdict against all except 37 of them was changed to life sentence, but another nearly 700 Islamists including the Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie were sentenced to death. As of 28 April, the trial of Morsi is still ongoing.\n\nEl-Sisi confirmed on 26 March 2014 that he would run for president in the presidential election. The presidential election, which took place between 26 and 28 May 2014, saw el-Sisi win 96 percent of votes counted.\n\n\n"}

Its members, of which the most prominent is the Catalan nationalist writer Jordi Bilbeny, hold that history has been systematically manipulated by the Spanish (or \"Castilian\") state since the 15th century to eliminate the Catalan contribution to world history. They claim that major historical figures, including Christopher Columbus, Erasmus, Miguel de Cervantes, William Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, Saint Teresa of Ávila and others were Catalan. The institute's work has been criticised as pseudohistory.\n\nThe institute promotes research, study and dissemination of ideas about Catalan influence on history through publications, conferences and symposia, in particular the annual \"Symposium on the Catalan Discovery of America\" in Arenys de Munt. It is funded by the Catalan autonomous government, and has received support from Catalan nationalist politicians.\n\nThe INH was created in 2007 following a split in the Foundation of Historical Studies of Catalonia. The principal researcher of the INH is Jordi Bilbeny, a member of the \"Arenysian Movement for Self-Determination\", a local independentist movement, and of the Arenys de Munt's Popular Unity Candidacy, who launched the \"Symposium on the Catalan Discovery of America\" in 2001. From its inception, the INH has undertaken the study and dissemination of the Catalan background and/or culture of Christopher Columbus, Miguel de Cervantes, \"Lazarillo de Tormes\", all topics put forward by Bilbeny.

In 2013, the Institute organized the first Universitat Nova Història in Pla de l'Estany, under the sponsorship of the Provincial Council of Girona, the municipality of Arenys de Mar, Cercle Català de Negocis (Catalan Business Circle), asamblea.cat, the Regional Council of Pla de l'Estany and Fundació Catalunya Estat.\n\nThe INH considers that the history of Catalonia has been manipulated and distorted since the end of the 15th century to favour the construct of a centralised Spanish (\"Castilian\") state.

It has collaborated with the separatist Catalan National Assembly in organising conferences on the history of Catalonia. In 2013 it was one of the recipients of the (President Lluís Companys National Awards) by the Sants-Montjuïc branch of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya. In 2012 the former president of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Jordi Pujol, wrote to Bilbeny congratulating him on his book \"Discovery and Catalan conquest of America. A history rewritten by the Castilians\", noting that the books published by the INH \"are very convincing\", while in 2014, the former vice-president of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, participated at the reissue of Bilbeny's \"Brief account of the destruction of history\", where he spoke in praise of the book.\n\nThe 2015 INH symposium in Arenys de Munt, under the title \"The Catalan Discovery of America\", was financed by the councils of Arenys de Munt and Arenys de Mar, together with associations such as the of Arenys de Munt. Muriel Casals, representative of the separatist coalition Junts pel Sí, gave the closing speech entitled \"From the erased past to political independence\".\n\nINH members have given talks on their theories in the main Catalan government-owned television and radio channels such as TV3 and Catalunya Ràdio.\n\nThe INH has been described by one academic as \"a group of Catalan self-styled scholars trying to prove and promote the idea that, throughout History, a massive conspiracy by the Crown of Castille, the Inquisition, and any institution that may be related to Castille, has been orchestrated against the nation of Catalonia to deprive it of its History and cultural identity in order to promote Castile\". It was criticised in the Catalan parliament by the opposition party Ciudadanos spokeswoman, Carina Mejías, who described its theories as \"ridiculous\". Javier Barraycoa, vice-chancellor of the Abat Oliba CEU University, former secretary of the in Catalonia, and member of the anti-Catalanist organisation Somatemps, said that the INH \"has absolutely no recognition in the academic world\" and that its members \"have not been invited to any serious congress because it is impossible for them to defend these things.\"\n\n"}

He joined the well known seminary at a very young age where he knew Bishop Blandini known for his social commitment. In 1881 he inscribed in the Law Faculty of Catania. and then continued his legal studies in Rome. In his youth he was the president and the chief promoter of the Catholic Youth Club \"St. Thomas Aquinas\", whereby lay Catholics gathered.\n\nIn 1887, at the age of 26, returned to the seminary in Caltagirone and September 21, 1889, was ordained a priest by Xavier Gerbino, previously the Bishop of Piazza Armerina.\nHe was rector of the seminary of Caltagirone in 1890-1891 and among his pupils was his brother Luigi, whom he helped to reach priesthood. He was later appointed canon of the Cathedral of Caltagirone and then vicar general. In 1894 he coordinated the work of the first diocesan synod. In his priestly activity he collaborated with his brother Louis to promote the Catholic movement Calatino. In 1895 the first interparochial committee of organization of congresses in St. George’s parish, with the youth section “St. Philip Neri”, the workers section, St. Joseph\" and the agricultural section, “St. Isidor”. In 1897 he collaborated in the redaction of the Catholic movement Calatino review, “The Cross of Constantine”, in which he published three novels of the popular-moralistic character with the pseudonymEneleo in the appendix. Moreover, he wrote 27 sketches which highlight his initial inclination for Christianity embodied in the story.\n\nIn 1903 Pope Leo XIII appointed him Bishop of Piazza Armerina and was consecrated in the cathedral of Catania by Cardinal Francesco Nava July 19, took possession of the diocese on 11 October and made the solemn entry on 15 November 1904.\nIn his first pastoral letter, of November 1903, he maintains, on the wake of the thought of his brother Luigi’s thought, that, for obtaining salvation of souls one cannot ignore so as to pursue interests of the body, through a commitment in the renewal of the society in the light of the social teaching of the church. He realized a general reorganization of the diocesan clergy and erected numerous parishes in almost all the twelve town councils of the diocese. He refounded the diocesan monthly bulletin, changing the title from “Gleaning” to “The Angel of the Family”. His episcopal activities were carried on, in the periodic pastoral visits, in the celebration of meetings of “Catholic Action”, in the Lenten preachings and retreats and in the conference for teachers and professionals. He reformed morally and materially the diocesan seminary, closed temporarily from 1904 to 1907 and from 1920 he started his activity of teaching in the internal school of the seminary. He founded in the diocese the priestly congregation of the Oblates of Mary, on the example required by Carlo Borromeo, for which he laid the constitutions and of which he organized the common life. In the villages of his diocese he favoured the rise of rural banks and other Catholic Social works. Some local officials accused him to the Holy See of modernism and socialism and was sent to the diocese as apostolic visitor, Charles Joseph Cecchini, who wrote to pope Pius X on 19 August 1907 a letter accompanied by a positive report on his reforms. He established in Piazza Armerina a Catholic School named after Prospero Intorcetta. He wrote numerous pastoral letters in which a cross-recurring theme was that of the family and moral education. He also wrote on the theme of psychological intense activity of the conversion and outlined a theology of the laity. For a decade he was also a secretary of the Sicilian Episcopal Conference and spread some collective pastoral letters. In 1937 he addressed at Enna the first Congress of the parish.\n\nHe was interested in philosophical studies, attempting to rinnovate the Scholastic Philosophy with the aim of putting the contemporary culture at the service of God and of the church as an apostolate instrument. From 1915 he collaborated with the neo-scholastic review. And critically confronted with some of the main exponents of the Western Philosophy, including Maurice Blondel, Etienne Gilson and Benedetto Croce, opposed to positivism and idealism. In 1927, after making contacts with scholars of the Catholic Institute in Paris and in Milan, with Fr. Agostino Gemelli, he founded in Piazza armerina a Literary-Philosophical Review (Review of Autoformation), that resumed faithfully in format and in the graphic the review, “Critic of Benedetto Croce”. He himself taught literature and philosophy, publishing notes which later on were collected in volumes.\n\nDuring the exile of his brother Luigi, former secretary of the Italian Popular Party, he exchanged with him many letters in which they discussed philosophy, theology, literature and mysticism. They loved and respected one another, but they criticized each other and at the same time strengthening one another spiritually. From those letters emerges despite the difference of their personality and of their personal histories, their profounding spirituality- the common anxiety of sanctity, the great intellectual approach and pastoral charity which led them to deepen the cultural and social relevance of the faith lived in the internal of the church. The two brothers do not write about politics just as “special surveillants” of the fascist regime. In the central archive of the State there are over a thousand sheets that refer to Sturzo don Luigi, was Felix, anti fascist. For Mario exist about three hundred sheets in the same archive in two funds. Mons. Mario Sturzo had an uncompromising attitude toward the fascist regime attracting ungenerous slanders and veiled persecutions which he endured with firmness and evangelical patience as ensues from the documentation preserved in the central archive of the state.\n\nThe initial aspect from which Sturzo begins his philosophical research is the “thought relation-action. Surely the action will be worthy of admiration only if it will have philosophical foundation and anthropological objective. For Sturzo there will be no true philosophical research if not in the history and at the service of the same, philosophy becomes almost the methodology of history in the sense that it gives method in living and in reading the same. “Sturzo, writes Salvatore Latora in opposition-dialogue with the modern philosophy goes on elaborating its philosophical system- the neo-synthetism, which inspired in a critical manner I. Kant and A. Rosmini , wants to propose a new form of classical realism and christian, supporting the thesis of priority of synthesis on analysis, which has at its centre man” (Latora Salvatore, Sturzo Mario, in \"Encyclopedic Dictionary of Thinkers and of Theologians of Sicily, 19th and 20th Centuries\", vol. VI, Salvatore Sciascia editor, Caltanisetta- Rome, 2010, 3062). The comparison with the epistemological subjectivism and the historicism of the “neo-Italian idealists” led him to grant a privilege to the role of the subject in the known process in a synthesis between immanence and transcendence, between natural and supernatural.\n\nHis life was not of easy paths or foreseen, indeed, his activity of philosophical research, had disapproval of the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the time. In 1931 there was a call of Holy Office of 17 January and came to be published an editorial of Catholic Civilization in which the content and language of Sturzo’s thought were criticized as they seemed to be closer to the neo-idealism of Cross and Gentile which are not to the Scholastic and Thomistic philosophy. They also criticize even his doctrine on knowledge, as also the concepts of philosophy and history. The explicit call of Holy Office put an end to the activity of the “Autoreformation Review” and brought the bishop to the public retraction in cathedral, after the solemn pontifical mass of 8 April 1931. On 19 of the same month the “Osservatore Romano” published the news, leaving his brother Luigi, who was from London in darkness of all stunned.

Bodyansky's close friends included Nikolai Gogol, Taras Shevchenko, Mykhaylo Maksymovych, and Pavel Jozef Šafárik. He was elected a corresponding member of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1854.\n\nBodyansky was born in the Poltava guberniya, and, as a student in Moscow, entered Stankevich's circle of intellectuals. After getting his master's degree, he was at work rummaging obscure libraries and archives of Little Russia. Such activities brought to light a splattering of important documents, such as the illustrated \"Peresopnytsia Gospels\" and the controversial \"History of the Rus\".\n\nBodyansky's publication of Giles Fletcher's sketch of Muscovy was deemed an act of Russophobia and incurred the displeasure of Tsar Nicholas I, leading to the scholar's departure from Moscow to Kazan. In his 30s, Bodyansky travelled in the Slavic countries on behalf of the Russian government, in order to study their languages, literature, and societies. Having for long moved in Slavophile and Pan-Slavist circles, he spent some time working in Prague with Šafárik. Upon his return he became professor in Moscow, where he died in 1878. His tomb is in the Novodevichy Convent.\n\nBodyansky was one of the first serious scholars of the Ukrainian language and wrote some amateur poetry in his native tongue. His master's dissertation involved a comparison of Ukrainian and Russian folks songs. Bodyansky's chief work was editing the \"Treatises of the Moscow Society for Russian History and Antiquities\" (1846–49 and 1858–78). Of his own works, notable are \"On the Folk Poetry of the Slavic Tribes\" (1837) and \"On the Time of Origin of the Slavic Script\" (1855).\n"}

While a monk in the Abbey of St. Paul Without the Walls, he made a collection of the numerous ancient inscriptions used in the pavement of the floor of the famous basilica or scattered among the cloister buildings and in the surrounding vineyards. These became soon the nucleus of a classified museum of Christian and Pagan inscriptions. Later on he became keeper of the archives and librarian of the Benedictines in Florence. Pius VI bestowed various benefices on him and made him titular Bishop of Cyrene.\n\nHis collection of inscriptions and his works on the higher papal officials of the old Lateran Palace remained authoritative for some time. His writings were directed to widely divergent periods and spheres of historical and archaeological research. On Roman antiquity he wrote: \"Capena, municipio dei Romani\" (Rome, 1756), and \"Gabbio, antica città di Sabina, scoperta ove era Torri\" (Rome, 1757). His two works \"Del Vestarario della santa Romana chiesa\" (Rome, 1758), and \"Del Primicerio della S.

{"id": "343524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343524", "title": "Rawalpindi", "text": "Rawalpindi\n\nRawalpindi (Punjabi, , '), commonly known as Pindi (), is a city in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Rawalpindi is adjacent to Pakistan's capital of Islamabad, and the two are jointly known as the \"twin cities\" on account strong social and economic links between the cities. Rawalpindi is the fourth-largest city in Pakistan by population, while the larger Islamabad Rawalpindi metropolitan area is the country's third-largest metropolitan area.\n\nRawalpindi is located on the Pothohar Plateau, known for its ancient Buddhist heritage, especially in the neighbouring town of Taxila - a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city was destroyed during the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni before being taken over by Gakhars in 1493. In 1765, the ruling Gakhars were defeated as the city came under Sikh rule, and eventually became a major city within the Sikh Empire based in Lahore. The city fell to the British Raj in 1849, and in 1851 became the largest garrison town for the British Indian Army. Following the partition of British India in 1947, the city became home to the headquarters of Pakistan Army hence retaining its status as a major military city.\n\nConstruction of Pakistan's new purpose-built national capital city of Islamabad in 1961 led to greater investment in the city, as well as a brief stint as the country's capital immediately before completion of Islamabad. Modern Rawalpindi is socially and economically intertwined with Islamabad, and the greater metropolitan area. The city is also home to numerous suburban housing developments that serve as bedroom-communities for workers in Islamabad. As home of Benazir Bhutto International Airport, and with connections to the M-1 and M-2 motorways, Rawalpindi is a major logistics and transportation centre for northern Pakistan. The city is also home to historic havelis and temples, and serves as a hub for tourists visiting Rohtas Fort, Azad Kashmir, Taxila and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nThe word \"Rawalpindi\" consists of two Punjabi words; Rawal, and Pindi. The origin of the name may derive from the combination of two words: \"Rawal\", meaning \"lake\" in Punjabi, and \"Pind\", meaning \"village.\" The combination of the two words thus means \"The village of lake\". Other sources have posited a Sanskrit origin of the city's name.\n\nThe region around Rawalpindi has been inhabited for thousands of years. Rawalpindi falls within the ancient boundaries of Gandhara, and is in a region littered with Buddhist ruins. In the region north-west of Rawalpindi, traces have been found of at least 55 stupas, 28 Buddhist monasteries, 9 temples, and various artifacts in the Kharoshthi script. To the southeast are the ruins of the Mankiala stupa – a 2nd-century stupa where, according to the Jataka tales, a previous incarnation of the Buddha leapt off a cliff in order to offer his corpse to seven hungry tiger cubs. The nearby town of Taxila is thought to have been home to the world's first university. Sir Alexander Cunningham identified ruins on the site of the Rawalpindi Cantonment as the ancient city of \"Ganjipur\" (or \"Gajnipur\"), the capital of the \"Bhatti\" tribe in the ages preceding the Christian era.\n\nThe first mention of Rawalpindi's earliest settlement dates from when Mahmud of Ghazni destoyed Rawalpindi and the town was restored by \"Gakhar\" chief \"Kai Gohar\" in the early 11th century. The town fell into decay again after Mongol invasions in the 14th century. Situated along an invasion route, the settlement did not prosper and remained deserted until 1493, when \"Jhanda Khan\" re-established the ruined town, and named it \"Rawal\".\n\nDuring the Mughal era, Rawalpindi remained under the rule of the Ghakhar clan, who in turn pledged allegiance to the Mughal Empire. The city was developed as an important outpost in order to guard the frontiers of the Mughal realm. Gakhars fortified a nearby caravanserai, in the 16th century, transforming it into the Rawat Fort in order to defend the Pothohar plateau from Sher Shah Suri's forces. Construction of the Attock Fort in 1581 after Akbar led a campaign against his brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim, further securing Rawalpindi's environs. In December 1585, the Emperor Akbar arrived in Rawalpindi, and remained in and around Rawalpindi for 13 years as he extended the frontiers of the empire, in an era described as a \"glorious period\" in his career as Emperor.\n\nWith the onset of chaos and rivalry between Gakhar chiefs after the death of Kamal Khan in 1559, Rawalpindi was awarded to Said Khan by the Mughal Emperor. The Emperor Jehangir visited the royal camp in Rawalpindi in 1622, where he first learned of Shah Abbas I of Persia's plan to invade Kandahar.\n\nRawalpindi declined in importance after the fall of the Mughals, until the town was captured in the mid 1760s from Muqarrab Khan by the Sikhs under Sardar Gujjar Singh and his son Sahib Singh. The city's administration was handed to Sardar Milkha Singh, who then invited traders from the neighboring commercial centers of Jhelum and Shahpur to settle in the territory in 1766. The city then began to prosper, although the population in 1770 is estimated to have been only about 300 families. Rawalpindi became for a time the refuge of Shah Shuja, the exiled king of Afghanistan, and of his brother Shah Zaman in the early 19th century.\n\nSikh ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh allowed the son of Sardar Milkha Singh to continue as Governor of Rawalpindi, after Ranjit Singh seized the district in 1810. Sikh rule over Rawalpindi was consolidated by defeat of the Afghans at Haidaran in July 1813. The Sikh rulers allied themselves with some of the local Gakhar tribes, and jointly defeated Syed Ahmad Barelvi at Akora Khattak in 1827, and again in 1831 in Balakot. Jews first arrived in Rawalpindi's \"Babu Mohallah\" neighbourhood from Mashhad, Persia in 1839, in order to flee from anti-Jewish laws instituted by the Qajar dynasty. In 1841, Diwan Kishan Kaur was appointed \"Sardar\" of Rawalpindi.\n\nOn 14 March 1849, Sardar Chattar Singh and Raja Sher Singh of the Sikh Empire surrendered to General Gilbert near Rawalpindi, ceding the city to the British. The Sikh Empire then came to an end on 29 March 1849.\n\nFollowing Rawalpindi's capture by the British Indian Empire, Her Majesty's 53 Regiment took quarters in the newly captured city. The decision to man a permanent military cantonment in the city was made in 1851 by the Marquess of Dalhousie. The city saw its first telegraph office in the early 1850s. The city's Garrison Church was built shortly after in 1854, and is the site where Robert Milman, Bishop of Calcutta, was buried following his death in Rawalpindi in 1876. The city was home to 15,913 people in the 1855 census. During the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, the area's Gakhars and Janjua tribes remained loyal to the British.\n\nNumerous civil and military buildings were built during the British era, and the Municipality of Rawalpindi was constituted in 1867, while the city's population as per the 1868 census was 19,228, with another 9,358 people residing in the city's cantonment. The city was also connected to railways that offered connection to India and the northwest frontier in Peshawar in the 1880s. The Commissariat Steam Flour Mills were the first such mills in Punjab, and supplied most of the needs of British cantonments throughout Punjab. Rawalpindi's cantonment served as a feeder to other cantonments throughout the region.\n\nRawalpindi flourished as a commercial centre, though the city remained largely devoid of an industrial base during the British era. A large portion of Kashmir's external trade passing through the city; in 1885, 14% of Kashmir's exports, and 27% of its imports passed through the city. A large market was opened in central Rawalpindi in 1883 by Sardar Sujan Singh, while the British further developed a shopping district for the city's elite known as \"Saddar\" with an archway built to commemorate Brigadier General Massey.\n\nRawalpindi's cantonment became a major center of military power of the Raj after an arsenal was established in 1883. Britain's army elevated the city from a small town, to the third largest city in Punjab by 1921. In 1868, 9,358 people lived in the city's cantonment - by 1891, the number rose to 37,870. In 1891, the city's population excluding the Cantonment was 34,153. The city was considered to be a favourite first posting for newly arrived soldiers from England, owing to the city's agreeable climate, and nearby hill station at nearby Murree. In 1901, Rawalpindi was made the winter headquarters of the Northern Command and of the Rawalpindi military division. Riots broke out against British rule in 1905, following a famine in Punjab that peasants were led to believe was a deliberate act.\n\nDuring World War 1, Rawalpindi District \"stood first\" among districts in recruiting for the British war effort, with greater financial assistance from the British government channeled into the area in return. By 1921, Rawalpindi's cantonment had overshadowed the city - Rawalpindi was one of seven cities of Punjab in which over half the population lived in the cantonment district. Communal riots erupted between Rawalpindi's Sikh and Muslim communities in 1926 after Sikhs refused to silence music from a procession that was passing in front of a mosque.\n\nOn 5 March 1947, members of Rawalpindi's Sikh and Hindu communities took out a procession against the formation of a Muslim ministry within the Government of Punjab. Policemen fired upon protestors, while Hindus and Sikhs fought against weaker Muslim counter-protestors. The area's first Partition riots erupted the next day on 6 March 1947, when the city's Muslims, angered by the actions of Hindus and Sikhs and encouraged by the Pir of Golra Sharif, raided nearby villages after they were unable to do so in the city on account of Rawalpindi's heavily armed Sikhs.\n\nAt the dawn of Pakistan's independence in 1947, Rawalpindi was a 43.79% Muslim, while Rawalpindi District as a whole was 80% Muslim. The region, on account of its large Muslim majority, was thus awarded to Rawalpindi's Hindu and Sikh population, who had made up 33.72% and 17.32% of the city, migrated \"en masse\" to the newly independent Dominion of India after communal riots in western Punjab, while Muslim refugees from India settled in the city following anti-Muslim pogroms in eastern Punjab and northern India.\n\nIn the years following independence, Rawalpindi saw an influx of Muhajir, Pashtun and Kashmiri settlers. Having been the largest British Cantonment in the region at the dawn of Pakistan's independence, Rawalpindi was chosen as headquarters for the Pakistani Army, despite the fact that Karachi had been selected as the first capital.\n\nIn 1951, the Rawalpindi conspiracy took place in which leftist army officers conspired to depose the first elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan. Rawalpindi later became the site of the Liaquat Ali Khan's assassination, in what is now known as Liaquat Bagh Park. In 1958, Field Marshal Ayub Khan launched his \"coup d'etat\" from Rawalpindi. In 1959, the city became the interim capital of the country under Ayub Khan, who had sought the creation of a new planned capital of Islamabad in the vicinity of Rawalpindi. As a result, Rawalpindi saw most major central government offices and institutions relocate to nearby territory, and its population rapidly expand.\n\nConstruction of Pakistan's new capital city of Islamabad in 1961 led to greater investment in Rawalpindi. Rawalpindi remained the headquarters of the Pakistani Army after the capital shifted to Islamabad in 1969, while the Pakistan Air Force continues to maintain an airbase in the Chaklala district of Rawalpindi. The military dictatorship of General Zia ul Haq hanged Pakistan's deposed Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in Rawalpindi in 1979.\n\nIn 1980, tens of thousands of Shia protestors led by Mufti Jaffar Hussain marched on Rawalpindi to protest a provision of Zia ul Haqs Islamization programme. A spate of bombings in September 1987 took place in the city killing 5 people, in attacks that are believed to have been orchestrated by agents of Afghanistan's communist government. On 10 April 1988, Rawalpindi's Ojhri Camp, an ammunition depot for Afghan mujahideen fighting against Soviet forces in Afghanistan, exploded and killed many in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. At the time, the New York Times reported more than 93 were killed and another 1,100 wounded; many believe that the toll was much higher.\n\nRiots erupted in Rawalpindi in 1992 as mobs attacked Hindu temples in retaliation for the destruction of the Babri Masjid in India by Hindu extremists. In March 2003, Pakistani authorities captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, mastermind of the September 11th attacks in New York City. On 27 December 2007, Rawalpindi was the site of the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.\n\nModern Rawalpindi is socially and economically intertwined with Islamabad, and the greater metropolitan area. The city is also home to numerous suburban housing developments that serve as bedroom-communities for workers in Islamabad. In June 2015, the Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus, a new bus rapid transit line with various points in Islamabad, opened for service.\n\nRawalpindi features a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cwa) with hot and wet summers, a cooler and drier winter. Rawalpindi and its twin city Islamabad, during the year experiences an average of 91 thunderstorms, which is the highest frequency of any plain elevation city in the country. Strong windstorms are frequent in the summer during which wind gusts have been reported by Pakistan Meteorological Department to have reached . In such thunder/wind storms, which results in some damage of infrastructure. The weather is highly variable due to the proximity of the city to the foothills of Himalayas.\n\nThe average annual rainfall is , most of which falls in the summer monsoon season. However, westerly disturbances also bring quite significant rainfall in the winter. In summer, the record maximum temperature has soared to recorded in June 1954, while it has dropped to a minimum of several occasions, though the last of which was in January 1967.\n\nSocial structures in Rawalpindi's historic core centre around neighbourhoods, each known as a \"Mohallah\". Each neighbourhood is served by a nearby bazaar and mosque, which in turn serve as a place with diverse people can gather for trade and manufacturing. Each \"Mohallah\" has narrow and short roads that are often unnamed. The grouping of houses around short lanes and cul-de-sacs lends a sense of privacy and security to residents of each neighbourhood. Major intersections in the neighbourhood are each referred to as a \"chowk\".\n\nSouth of Rawalpindi's historic core, and across the Lai Nullah, are the verdant and wide lanes of the Rawalpindi Cantonment. With tree-lined avenues and historic architecture, the cantonment was the main European area developed during British colonial rule. British colonialists also built the Saddar Bazaar south of the historic core, which served as a retail centre geared towards Europeans in the city. Beyond the cantonment are the large suburban housing developments that serve as bedroom communities for Islamabad's commuter population.\n\nThe population of Rawalpindi is 2,098,231 in 2017. 84% of the population is Punjabi, 9% is Pashtun, and 7% is from other ethnic groups.\n\n96.8% of Rawalpindi's population is Muslim, 2.47% is Christian, 0.73% belong to other religious groups. The city's \"Kohaati Bazaar\" is site of large Shia mourning-processions for Ashura. The neighbourhoods of \"Waris Shah Mohallah\" and \"Pir Harra Mohallah\" form the core of Muslim settlement in Rawalpindi's old city.\n\nRawalpindi was a majority Hindu and Sikh city prior to the Partition of British India in 1947, while Muslims made up 43.79% of the population. The Baba Dyal Singh Gurdwara in Rawalpindi was where the reformist Nirankari movement of Sikhism originated. The city's Sikh population is small, but has been bolstered by the arrival of Sikhs fleeing political instability in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nThe city is still home to a few hundred Hindu families. Despite the fact that the vast majority of the city's Hindus fled \"en masse\" to India after Partition, most Hindu temples in the old city remain standing, although in disrepair and often abandoned. Many of the old city's neighbourhoods continue to bear Hindu and Sikh names, such as Krishanpura, Arya Mohallah, Akaal Garh, Mohanpura, Amarpura, Kartarpura, Bagh Sardaraan, Angatpura.\n\nRawalpindi's Krishna Temple, built in the Kabarri Bazaar in 1897, and the Guru Balmik Swamiji Temple in Rawalpindi Cantonment, remain open to the public. Other temples are abandoned or were repurposed. Rawalpindi's large Kalyan Das Temple from 1880 has been used as the \"Gov't. Qandeel Secondary School for the Blind\" since 1973. The Ram Leela Temple in \"Kanak Mandi\", and the Kaanji Mal Ujagar Mal Ram Richpal Temple in the Kabarri Bazaar, are both currently used to house Kashmiri refugees. Mohan Temple in the \"Lunda Bazaar\" remains standing, but is abandoned and the building no longer used for any purpose. The city's \"Shamshan Ghat\" serves as the city's cremation grounds, and was partly renovated in 2012.\n\nThe city's \"Babu Mohallah\" neighbourhood was once home to a community of Jewish traders that had fled Mashhad, Persia in the 1830s. The community had entirely emigrated to Israel by the 1960s.\nThe Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus is a bus rapid transit service that connects Rawalpindi to Islamabad. The Metrobus network was opened on 4 June 2015, and connects the Pak Secretariat in Islamabad to Saddar in Rawalpindi. A second stage is currently under construction from Peshawar Morr Interchange to the New Islamabad International Airport. The system uses e-ticketing and Intelligent Transportation System wand and is managed by the Punjab Mass Transit Authority.\n\nRawalpindi is situated along the historic Grand Trunk Road that connects Peshawar to Islamabad and Lahore. The road is roughly paralleled by the M-1 Motorway between Peshawar and Rawalpindi, while the M-2 Motorway provides an alternate route to Lahore via the Salt Range. The Grand Trunk Road also provides access to the Afghan border via the Khyber Pass, with onwards connections to Kabul and Central Asia via the Salang Pass. The Karakoram Highway provides access between Islamabad and western China, and an alternate route to Central Asia via Kashgar in the Chinese region of Xinjiang.\n\nThe Islamabad Expressway connects Rawalpindi's eastern portions with the Rawal Lake and heart of Islamabad. The IJP Road separates Rawalpindi's northern edge from Islamabad.\n\nRawalpindi is connected to Peshawar by the M-1 Motorway. The motorway also links Rawalpindi to major cities in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, such as Charsadda and Mardan. The M-2 motorway offers high speed access to Lahore via the Potohar Plateau and Salt Range. The M-3 Motorway branches off from the M-2 at the city of Pindi Bhattian, where the M-3 offers onward connections to Faisalabad, and connects to the M-4 Motorway which continues onward to Multan. A new motorway network is under construction to connect Multan and Karachi as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor.\n\nThe Hazara Motorway is also under construction as part of CPEC, and will provide control-access motorway travel all the way to Mansehra via the M-1 or Grand Trunk Road.\n\nRawalpindi railway station in the Saddar neighbourhood serves as a stop along Pakistan's -long Main Line-1 railway that connects the city to the port city of Karachi to Peshawar. The stations is served by the Awam Express, Hazara Express, Islamabad Express, Jaffar Express, Khyber Mail trains, and serves as the terminus for the Margalla Express, Mehr Express, Rawal Express, Pakistan Express, Subak Raftar Express, Subak Kharam Express, and Tezgam trains.\n\nThe entire Main Line-1 railway track between Karachi and Peshawar is to be overhauled at a cost of $3.65 billion for the first phase of the project, with completion by 2021. Upgrading of the railway line will permit train travel at speeds of 160 kilometres per hour, versus the average 60 to 105 km per hour speed currently possible on existing track.\n\nRawalpindi is served by the Islamabad International Airport. The airport is located in Fateh Jang, Attock. It offers non-stop flights throughout Pakistan, as well as to the Middle East, Europe, North America, Cenral Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe City-District of Rawalpindi is sub-divided into one Municipal Corporation Two Cantonment Board and Seven tehsils:\nRawalpindi also holds many private colonies that have developed themselves rapidly, e.g. Gulraiz Housing Society, Korang Town, Agochs Town, Ghori Town, Pakistan Town, Judicial Town, Bahria Town which is the Asia's largest private colony, Kashmir Housing Society, Danial Town, Al-Haram City, Education City.\n\nAyub National Park is located beyond the old Presidency on Jhelum Road.

The Park was opened to the public in 1991. It has a playland for children, grassy lawns, fountains and flower beds.\n\nIn 2008 Jinnah Park was inaugurated at the heart of Rawalpindi and has since become a hotspot of activity for the city. People from as far out as Peshawer come to Jinnah Park to enjoy its modern facilities. It houses a state-of-the-art cinema, Cinepax, a Metro Cash and Carry supermart, an outlet of McDonald's, gaming lounges, Motion Rides and other recreational facilities.

In archeological excavations a common cause of inversions in the stratigraphy is the collapse of walls on river banks or other raised mounds where deposits which have been cut through behind the wall prior to collapse slip over the collapsed structure resulting in the structure being under the deposits that originated earlier in time. In this case care must be taken to re-context the slipped deposits so the event of slippage appears in the correct place stratigraphically in the Harris matrix. There are numerous process that can reverse the stratigraphy or more accurately redeposit it. Many rely on slope processes, however other instances where deposits containing material later than overlying deposits occur in such features as drains or hypocaust systems. In these instances a clear understanding of the direction of \"UP\" and site formation processes is essential. Drains or hypocaust systems often have later material deposited within them during their \"use\", which may be much much later than either their initial construction or indeed the construction, use and disuse of the floors above them.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "696547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=696547", "title": "Skeleton Army", "text": "Skeleton Army\n\nThe Skeleton Army was a diffuse group, particularly in Southern England, that opposed and disrupted The Salvation Army's marches against alcohol in the late 19th century. Clashes between the two groups led to the deaths of several Salvationists and injuries to many others.\n\nThe earliest reference to an organised opposition to The Salvation Army was in August 1880 in Whitechapel, when 'The Unconverted Salvation Army' was founded with its flag and motto of \"Be just and fear not.\"\n\nIn 1881 Skeleton Armies were raised in Whitechapel, Exeter and Weston-super-Mare, and the name was quickly taken up elsewhere as other groups were formed in the south of England; there are no records of Skeleton Armies north of London. Membership was predominantly lower to middle working-class.\n\nThe \"Skeletons\" recognised each other by various insignia used to distinguish themselves. Skeletons used banners with skulls and crossbones; sometimes there were two coffins and a statement like, \"Blood and Thunder\" (mocking the Salvation Army's war cry \"Blood and Fire\") or the three Bs: \"Beef\", \"Beer\" and \"Bacca\" – again mocking the Salvation Army's three S's – \"Soup\", \"Soap\" and \"Salvation\". Banners also had pictures of monkeys, rats and the devil. Skeletons further published so-called \"gazettes\" considered libellous as well as obscene and blasphemous.\n\nSeveral techniques were employed by the \"Skeletons\" to disrupt Salvation Army meetings and marches; these included throwing rocks and dead rats, marching while loudly playing musical instruments or shouting, and physically assaulting Salvation Army members at their meetings.\n\nAlhough George Scott Railton, second in command of the Salvation Army, claimed the Skeleton Army first started in Weston-super-Mare in 1881, contemporary press reports show that it first appeared in Exeter in October 1881. In Weston-super-Mare, in March 1882 Captain William Beatty, Thomas Bowden and William Mullins were given a three-month prison sentence by the magistrates for a breach of the peace when they broke a local ban on processions.\n\nThis led to the case of \"Beatty v Gillbanks\" (1882), which held that the Salvation Army was acting lawfully when marching, despite knowing that their assembly could well lead to riots. As their intentions were ultimately peaceful and unrelated to the cause of inciting riot, the court found their actions to be within the limits of the law. That it was known that their marching may cause riots was not found to be a breach of the law, as it was the actions of antagonistic parties including the Skeleton Army which led directly to the riotous behaviour. The convictions against Beatty and the two other Salvationists were later quashed by the Queen's Court and costs were awarded against the sentencing magistrates.\nThe action was reported by \"The Times\"; at the appeal hearing it was erroneously stated that the Skeleton Army was founded in Weston-super-Mare.\n\nOf an attack in Bethnal Green in November 1882 the \"Bethnal Green Eastern Post\" stated:\n\nA genuine rabble of 'roughs' pure and unadulterated has been infesting the district for several weeks past. These vagabonds style themselves the 'Skeleton Army'... The 'skeletons' have their collectors and their collecting sheets and one of them was thrust into my hands... it contained a number shopkeepers' names... I found that publicans, beer sellers and butchers are subscribing to this imposture... the collector told me that the object of the Skeleton Army was to put down the Salvationists by following them about everywhere, by beating a drum and burlesquing their songs, to render the conduct of their processions and services impossible... Amongst the Skeleton rabble there is a large percentage of the most consummate loafers and unmitigated blackguards London can produce...worthy of the disreputable class of publicans who hate the London School Board, education and temperance and who, seeing the beginning of the end of their immoral traffic, and prepared for the most desperate enterprise.\n\nBoth sources agree Salvationists were pelted with missiles. At Bethnal Green, such items as flour, rotten eggs, stones and brickbats were among those used, and many Salvationists were manhandled and beaten. When news of trouble in London spread, Skeleton riots took place in other parts of Britain.\n\nFor example, when in April 1884 the owner of an alcohol shop in Worthing objected to Salvation Army criticism concerning the selling of alcoholic beverages, 4,000 \"Skeletons\" joined together in that town in direct opposition to the Salvationists. Black, sticky tar was painted onto the wall of the alley which the entrance to the Salvation Army barracks shared with the alcohol shop. This damaged Salvation Army uniforms as they marched through it. Also eggs filled with blue paint were thrown at the \"Sally Army\". Many in Worthing approved of these confrontational activities, but the Salvation Army continued unabated.\n\nCaptain Ada Smith led those who faced the \"Skeletons\" in Worthing. General Booth requested police protection for the Salvation Army in that town and ordered Captain Smith and her soldiers to remain in their barracks until they got it. However, the Home Secretary, Sir William Harcourt, said it was outside his jurisdiction to offer such protection. Finally General Booth ordered Captain Smith and her group to march on Sundays unprotected by the authorities.\n\nOn Sunday, 17 August 1884, the police, the Salvation Army and the Skeletons confronted each other in Worthing. For an hour the police kept the peace, then the Skeletons rioted. The area was filled with screaming men, brick dust and broken glass. The Salvationists returned to their \"barracks\" and the Skeletons tried to burn it down. The landlord of the barracks, George Head, a Salvation Army supporter, defended his property and the people there with a revolver, wounding several Skeletons. Head was later brought before the magistrates on a charge of feloniously and maliciously wounding a young man named Olliver.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police were at first unhelpful. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Edmund Henderson denied what happened. The public eventually demanded action and Skeleton riots in London were belatedly put down.\n\nSkeleton riots continued elsewhere until 1893 when they faded out. In 1889 at least 669 Salvation Army members were assaulted, including 251 women. On one occasion, while defending themselves 86 Salvation Army members were arrested and imprisoned on disorderly conduct charges. When a new Salvation Army Corps was opened in Potton in Bedfordshire on 1 June 1890, large contingents of the Skeleton Army made fun of the local Salvationists. \"The War Cry\" reported:\n\n... the skeletons did all the shouting and we had only the opportunity of blessing them by showing unruffled love in answer to the disturbance in our proceedings\"...\"The skeleton flag was out with its coffin, skull and cross-bones as well as the whole Skeleton force, uniformed, beating a drum, playing flutes, whirling rattles and screaming through trumpets. One of their chosen leaders was carried shoulder high, ringing a bell and attired in an untrimmed coal-scuttle bonnet. I noticed that the publicans looked pleased to see this array and several waved their hats. But we were good friends of the skeletons, twelve of whom sat at our tea table... Their leaders were very courteous and sincerely desirous of keeping their somewhat rabble followers within bounds. Almost implicit obedience was given them. Their skeleton War Cry was freely sold, but doesn't quite beat the original.\n\nAt Guildford the corps officer's wife was kicked unconscious close to a police station and a woman Salvationist fatally injured. At Shoreham too, a woman was killed when a stone hit her. The mayor of Eastbourne stated he would, \"put down this Salvation Army business\" with help from the Skeleton Army if necessary. Skeletons attacked many Salvationists. Salvationists considered it incompatible with Christian principles to defend themselves but thought the police should protect them.\n\nCharles Jeffries was a 'lieutenant' in the Skeleton Army in Whitechapel in 1881, and was well known for disrupting Salvation Army public meetings and on occasion had assaulted Salvation Army Soldiers and Officers. Then Jeffries was proselytised and started to attend a Salvation Army corps, soon becoming an active Soldier, and then after attending training college, became an Officer. He served in many countries including China and Australia and eventually rose to the rank of Commissioner, serving as the head of corps work as British Commissioner in the 1930s.\n"}

In the process of warming up, the planet saw several \"cold snaps\" and \"warm snaps\", such as the Older Dryas and the Holocene climatic optimum, as well as heavier precipitation. In addition, the Pleistocene megafauna became extinct due to environmental and evolutionary pressures from the changing climate. This marked the end of the Quaternary extinction event, which was continued into the modern era by humans.

Four-Ranger \"chalk\" \"fast-rope\" in. A Ranger, Private First Class Todd Blackburn, misses the rope and falls 70 feet to the street.\n\n15:47 – Large crowds of Somalis begin converging on the target area.\n\n15:58 – One of the vehicles, a five-ton truck, is hit and disabled by a rocket propelled grenade. Twenty-seven American soldiers are wounded.\n\n16:00 – Groups of armed Somalis from the city of Mogadishu begin converging on the target area .\n\n16:02 – Raid targets captured: Assault force reports both clan leaders and about 21 others were in custody. As the force prepares to pull out, three vehicles are detached to rush the wounded Private Blackburn back to the base. SGT Dominick Pilla is killed as these vehicles return to base, becoming the first American fatality.\n\n16:15 – The convoy is delayed and does not move out due to confusion about who is signaling whom. It turned out that \"Delta\" was waiting for the convoy to originate the signal to them while the convoy was waiting for Delta to initiate the signal to them. The prisoners were eventually loaded after the Delta teams moved the prisoners to the trucks.\n\n16:20 – First helicopter crash: Black Hawk \"Super 6-1\" is hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and crashed five blocks northeast of the target building. Delta Force snipers SSG Daniel Busch and SGT Jim Smith, survive the crash and begin to defend the crash site.\n\n16:22 – Crowds of armed Somalis start racing towards the Super 6-1 crash site.\n\n16:26 – A Humvee convoy starts moving. When the prisoners are loaded up, the convoy and ground forces all begin moving towards the crashed helicopter. Black Hawk \"Super 6-4\", piloted by Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant, takes the place of Black Hawk Super 6-1 circling over the city.\n\n16:28 – Search and rescue of Black Hawk Super 6-1: search and rescue team ropes in to assist the crew of the first crashed helicopter. Both pilot and co-pilot were dead.\n\n16:35 – The Convoy made a wrong turn and got lost among the city streets, sustaining heavy casualties by Somali snipers and armed militia.\n\n16:40 – Second helicopter crash: Mike Durant's Black Hawk, Super 6-4, is also hit by a Somali rocket propelled grenade, and crashed about a mile southwest of the target building. Hostile crowds of Somalians begin moving toward it as well.\n\n16:42 – Two Delta Force snipers, Sergeant First Class Randy Shughart and Master Sergeant Gary Gordon, who had been providing cover fire by air were inserted into the crash site by helicopter at their own request, to help protect the injured Durant and his crew.\n\n16:54 – HMMWV convoy abandons Black Hawk Super 6-1 search. The Lost Convoy, with more than half of its force either wounded or dead, abandons its search for the first downed Black Hawk and begins fighting its way back to the base.\n\n17:03 – Quick Reaction Force convoy (a smaller, emergency convoy) is dispatched from Command and Control in an attempt to rescue the men stranded at Durant's crash site. It encounters immediate obstacles.\n\n17:34 – QRF and the Lost Convoy decided to return to base. Both convoys, having sustained heavy casualties, linked up and abandon the efforts to break through to Durant. The remainder of the ground force of Rangers and commandos were converging around the first crash site, sustaining many casualties. Ranger Corporal Jamie Smith is among those shot.\n\n17:40 – Snipers Shughart and Gordon run out of ammunition and are killed when hostile Somalis overrun Durant's crash site. Every member of the crew are dead, except for Durant, who suffered a broken leg and injured back. Durant is carried off by militia (He was eventually released to the Red Cross, 11 days later.) During Operation Gothic Serpent in Somalia, Durant was the pilot of helicopter \"Super Six Four.\" It was the second MH-60L of two Black Hawk helicopters to crash during the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. His helicopter was hit on the tail by a rocket-propelled grenade. That led to its crash about a mile southwest of the operation's target. (Both Gordon and Shughart received the Medal of Honor posthumously for their heroism in this action.)\n\n17:45 – Both convoys return to the base. Ninety-nine men remain trapped and surrounded in the city around the first downed Black Hawk. Corporal Smith is bleeding heavily, medic requests immediate evacuation.\n\n19:08 – Black Hawk Super \"6-6\" makes a daring re-supply run, dropping water, ammunition and medical supplies to the trapped force. It is badly damaged, cannot land to evacuate Corporal Smith, and limps back to base.\n\n20:27 – Ranger Corporal Jamie Smith dies.\n\n21:00 – Joint Task Force Command requests assistance from other commands. The Rescue Convoy, composed of two companies of 10th Mt. Division troops along with the remainder of Task Force Ranger, Pakistani tanks and Malaysian armored vehicles, is formed at Mogadishu's \"New Port\", and begins planning the rescue.\n\n23:23 – The rescue convoy moves out, but as it approaches the crash site there is a large explosion which severely damages the convoy and makes the rescue almost impossible. However, a stockpile of rocket-propelled grenades in the city allows them to be used to great effect. A large proportion of the population is affected by power outages due to the Americans' destroying electrical substations in Mogadishu.\n\nAt Midnight 00:00 (24:00), the Rangers are still trapped inside Mogadishu without essential equipment, such as night vision devices.\n\n01:55 — Rescue convoy reaches the trapped Ranger force. A second half of the convoy reaches the site of Durant's downed Black Hawk. Durant and his crew are missing.\n\n03:00 — Forces are still struggling to remove the pinned body of Clifton \"Elvis\" Wolcott, pilot of downed Super Six One.\n\n05:30 — Rangers start moving from the city to the Pakistani Stadium, on foot. Wolcott's body is finally recovered. Vehicles roll out of the city. Elements of the Rangers are left to run to a rendez-vous point on National Street, covering the vehicles whilst enduring gunfire during the exfiltration. The road they take is known as the Mogadishu Mile.\n\n06:30 — The force returns to the Pakistani Stadium. 13 Americans are confirmed dead or mortally wounded, 73 injured, and 6 missing in action (5 are later confirmed dead, raising the death toll to 18, and 1 taken prisoner).\n"}

As part of the organisation's revisionist agenda, it advanced the idea of the purely military role of the Waffen-SS.\n\nThe first major work by one of the HIAG leaders, it was published by , owned by a right-wing politician and publisher . Hausser's book, along with those by other key HIAG members Felix Steiner and Kurt Meyer, has been characterised by the historian Charles Sydnor as one of the \"most important works of [Waffen-SS] apologist literature.\"\n\nFrom 1950, Hausser was active in HIAG, a revisionist organization and a lobby group of former Waffen-SS members. HIAG began in late 1950 as a loose association of local groups; by October 1951, it claimed to have 376 local branches. In December 1951, Hausser became its first spokesperson.\n\nAs part of its lobbying efforts, HIAG attempted to advance the idea of the Waffen-SS being the \"fourth branch of the Wehrmacht\" and in no way connected to the crimes of the regime. HIAG's rewriting of history included significant multi-prong propaganda efforts, including tendentious periodicals, books and public speeches, along with a publishing house – Munin Verlag – to serve as a platform for its publicity aims. The express aim of Munin Verlag was to publish the \"war narratives\" of former Waffen-SS members, in cooperation with HIAG.\n\nBritish military historian Keith Simpson in his book \"Waffen SS\" quotes Hausser for writing that, he \"hoped the work would disperse the lies and calumnies which had formed themselves around the Waffen-SS and help to give this courageous formation its place.\" The book had an unmistakable connection to the Nazi origins of the Waffen-SS: the SS runes on the cover art and the SS motto (\"my honor is my loyalty\") embossed on the cloth cover. A foreword from the former Wehrmacht general Hans Guderian provided an endorsement for the Waffen-SS troops and referred to them as \"the first realization of the European idea\".\n\nThe book described the growth of Waffen-SS into a so-called multinational force where foreign volunteers fought heroically as a \"militant example of the great European idea\". Historians have refuted this characterisation, arguing that it was largely Nazi propaganda employed to bolster the ranks of the Waffen-SS with foreign volunteers. The message was later repurposed by HIAG as it sought historical and legal rehabilitation of the force.\n\nHausser wrote another book, published in 1966 by HIAG's imprint , under the title \"Soldaten wie andere auch\" (\"Soldiers Like Any Other\"). According to the military historian S.P. MacKenzie, the work epitomised how HIAG leaders wanted the Waffen-SS to be remembered, while the historian Charles Sydnor described it as \"equally tendentious\".\n\n\"Waffen-SS in Action\" was included in the index of objectionable war books maintained by West Germany's Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons. The index was created in the early 1960s to limit the sale of such works to minors due to their chauvinism and glorification of violence.\n\nHausser's books, along with those by other key HIAG members and former Waffen-SS generals Felix Steiner and Kurt Meyer, have been characterised by the historian Charles Sydnor as the \"most important works of [Waffen-SS] apologist literature.\" These works demanded rehabilitation of the military branch of the Nazi Party and presented Waffen-SS members as both victims and misunderstood heroes.\n\n\n"}

Friedman\n\nWilliam Frederick Friedman (September 24, 1891 – November 12, 1969) was a US Army cryptographer who ran the research division of the Army's Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) in the 1930s, and parts of its follow-on services into the 1950s. In 1940, subordinates of his led by Frank Rowlett broke Japan's PURPLE cipher, thus disclosing Japanese diplomatic secrets before America's entrance into World War II.\n\nFriedman was born Wolf Friedman (, ), in Chişinău, Bessarabia, the son of Frederick Friedman, a Jew from Bucharest who worked as a translator and linguist for the Russian Postal Service, and the daughter of a well-to-do wine merchant. Friedman's family fled Russia in 1892 to escape the virulent anti-Semitism there, ending up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Three years later, his first name was changed to William.\n\nAs a child, Friedman was introduced to cryptography in the short story \"The Gold-Bug\" by Edgar Allan Poe. He studied at the Michigan Agricultural College (known today as Michigan State University) in East Lansing and received a scholarship to work on genetics at Cornell University. Meanwhile, George Fabyan, who ran a private research laboratory to study any personally interesting project, decided to set up his own genetics project and was referred to Friedman. Friedman joined Fabyan's Riverbank Laboratories outside Chicago in September 1915. As head of the Department of Genetics, one of the projects he ran studied the effects of moonlight on crop growth, and so he experimented with the planting of wheat during various phases of the moon.\n\nAnother of Fabyan's pet projects was research into secret messages which Sir Francis Bacon had allegedly hidden in various texts during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. The research was carried out by Elizabeth Wells Gallup. She believed that she had discovered many such messages in the works of William Shakespeare, and convinced herself that Bacon had written many, if not all, of Shakespeare's works. Friedman had become something of an expert photographer while working on his other projects, and was asked to travel to England on several occasions to help Gallup photograph historical manuscripts during her research. He became fascinated with the work as he courted Elizebeth Smith, Mrs. Gallup's assistant and an accomplished cryptographer. They married, and he soon became director of Riverbank's Department of Codes and Ciphers as well as its Department of Genetics. During this time, Friedman wrote a series of 23 papers on cryptography, collectively known as the \"Riverbank publications\", including the first description of the index of coincidence, an important mathematical tool in cryptanalysis.\n\nWith the entry of the United States into World War I, Fabyan offered the services of his Department of Codes and Ciphers to the government. No Federal department existed for this kind of work (although both the Army and Navy had had embryonic departments at various times), and soon Riverbank became the unofficial cryptographic center for the US Government. During this period, the Friedmans broke a code used by German-funded Indian radicals in the US who planned to ship arms to India to gain independence from Britain. Analysing the format of the messages, Riverbank realized that the code was based on a dictionary of some sort, a cryptographic technique common at the time. The Friedmans soon managed to decrypt most of the messages, but only long after the case had come to trial did the book itself come to light: a German-English dictionary published in 1880.\n\nThe United States government decided to set up its own cryptological service, and sent Army officers to Riverbank to train under Friedman. To support the program, Friedman wrote a series of technical monographs, completing seven by early 1918. He then enlisted in the Army and went to France to serve as the personal cryptographer for General John J. Pershing. He returned to the US in 1920 and published an eighth monograph, \"The Index of Coincidence and its Applications in Cryptography\", considered by some to be the most important publication in modern cryptography to that time. His texts for Army cryptographic training were well thought of and remained classified for several decades.\n\nIn 1921 he became chief cryptanalyst for the War Department and later led the Signals Intelligence Service (SIS)—a position he kept for a quarter century. In 1929, after The American Black Chamber in New York City was disbanded, its files were entrusted to SIS, and the cryptographic and intelligence services was reorganized to suit its new position at the War Department.\n\nFriedman coined several terms, including \"cryptanalysis\", and wrote many monographs on cryptography. One of these (written mostly in his spare time) was the first draft of his \"Elements of cryptanalysis\", which later was expanded to four volumes and became the U.S. Army's cryptographic main textbook and reference. Realizing that mathematical and language skills were essential to SIS' work, Friedman managed to get authority to hire three men with both mathematical training and language knowledge. They were Solomon Kullback, Frank Rowlett and Abraham Sinkov, each of whom went on to distinguished service for decades. In addition he also was finally able to hire a man fluent in Japanese, John Hurt.\n\nDuring this period Elizebeth Friedman continued her own work in cryptology, and became famous in a number of trials involving rum-runners and the Coast Guard and FBI during Prohibition.\n\nDuring the 1920s, several new cipher machines were developed generally based on using typewriter mechanics and basic electrical circuitry. An early example was the Hebern Rotor Machine, designed in the US in 1915 by Edward Hebern. This system offered such security and simplicity of use that Hebern heavily promoted it to investors.\n\nFriedman realized that the new rotor machines would be important, and devoted some time to analysing Hebern's design. Over a period of years, he developed principles of analysis and discovered several problems common to most rotor-machine designs. Examples of some dangerous features included having rotors step one position with each keypress, and putting the fastest rotor (the one that turns with every keypress) at either end of the rotor series. In this case, by collecting enough ciphertext and applying a standard statistical method known as the kappa test, he showed that he could, albeit with great difficulty, crack any cipher generated by such a machine.\n\nFriedman used his understanding of rotor machines to develop several that were immune to his own attacks. The best of the lot, the SIGABA—which was destined to become the US's highest-security cipher machine in World War II—was co-invented by Frank Rowlett. At least one patent related to it was finally granted after Friedman had died.\n\nIn 1939, the Japanese introduced a new cipher machine for their most sensitive diplomatic traffic, replacing an earlier system that SIS referred to as \"RED.\" The new cipher, which SIS called \"PURPLE\", was different and much more difficult. The Navy's cryptological unit (OP-20-G) and the SIS thought it might be related to earlier Japanese cipher machines, and agreed that SIS would handle the attack on the system. After several months trying to discover underlying patterns in PURPLE ciphertexts, an SIS team led by Friedman and Rowlett, in an extraordinary achievement, figured it out. PURPLE, unlike the German Enigma or the Hebern design, did not use rotors but stepper switches like those in automated telephone exchanges. Leo Rosen of SIS built a machine — as was later discovered, using the identical model of switch that the Japanese designer had chosen.\n\nThus, by the end of 1940, SIS had constructed an exact analog of the PURPLE machine without ever having seen one. With the duplicate machines and an understanding of PURPLE, SIS could decrypt increasing amounts of Japanese traffic. One such intercept was the message to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., ordering an end (on December 7, 1941) to negotiations with the US. The message gave a clear indication of impending war, and was to have been delivered to the US State Department only hours prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The controversy over whether the US had foreknowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack has roiled well into the 21st century.\n\nIn 1941, Friedman was hospitalized with a \"nervous breakdown\", widely attributed to the mental strain of his work on PURPLE. While he remained in hospital, a four-man team — Abraham Sinkov and Leo Rosen from SIS, and Lt. Prescott Currier and Lt. Robert Weeks from the U.S. Navy's OP-20-G — visited the British establishment at the \"Government Code and Cypher School\" at Bletchley Park. They gave the British a PURPLE machine, in exchange for details on the design of the Enigma machine and on how the British decrypted the Enigma cipher. However Friedman visited Bletchley Park in April 1943 and played a key role in drawing up the 1943 BRUSA Agreement.\n\nFollowing World War II, Friedman remained in government signals intelligence. In 1949 he became head of the cryptographic division of the newly formed Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA) and in 1952 became chief cryptologist for the National Security Agency (NSA) when it was formed to take over from AFSA. Friedman produced a classic series of textbooks, \"Military Cryptanalysis\", which was used to train NSA students. (These were revised and extended, under the title \"Military Cryptanalytics\", by Friedman's assistant and successor Lambros D. Callimahos, and used to train many additional cryptanalysts.) During his early years at NSA, he encouraged it to develop what were probably the first super-computers, although he was never convinced a machine could have the \"insight\" of a human mind.\n\nFriedman spent much of his free time trying to decipher the famous Voynich Manuscript, written sometime between 1403–1437. However, after four decades of study he finally had to admit defeat, contributing no more than an educated guess as to its origins and meaning.\n\nIn 1955, Friedman initiated, on behalf of the NSA, a secret agreement with Crypto AG, a Swiss manufacturer of encryption machines. The agreement resulted in many of the company's machines being compromised, so that the messages produced by them became crackable by the NSA.\n\nFriedman retired in 1956 and, with his wife, turned his attention to the problem that had originally brought them together: examining Bacon's supposed codes. Together they wrote a book entitled \"The Cryptologist Looks at Shakespeare\" which won a prize from the Folger Library and was published under the title \"The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined.\" The book demonstrated flaws in Gallup's work and in that of others who sought hidden ciphers in Shakespeare's work.\n\nAt NSA's request Friedman prepared \"Six Lectures Concerning Cryptography and Cryptanalysis\", which he delivered at NSA. But later the Agency, concerned about security, confiscated the reference materials from Friedman's home.\n\nFriedman's health began to fail in the late 1960s, and he died in 1969. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nFriedman and his wife donated their archives to the library of the George C. Marshall Foundation, which also has had material reclassified and removed by the NSA.\n\nFriedman has been inducted into the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame and there is a building named after William and Elizebeth at the NSA complex at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland. He was also presented the Medal for Merit by President Harry Truman, and the National Security Medal by Dwight Eisenhower. Friedman and his wife Elizebeth are buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nFriedman has the distinction of having one of the longest known suppressed patent applications, for , a patent for a \"cryptographic system\". It was filed on July 25, 1933, issued on August 1, 2000.\n\nCommander Schoen, a character appearing in Neal Stephenson's novel \"Cryptonomicon\", is to a large extent inspired by Friedman. Schoen shares a significant background and personality traits with Friedman, including being one of the top cryptanalysts of the U.S. Army, breaking Japanese codes prior to Japan's involvement in World War II, and the psychological problems that he suffered from as a result. In his acknowledgements, Stephenson writes \"Among all these great wartime hackers, some kind of special recognition must go to William Friedman, who sacrificed his health to break the Japanese machine cipher called Purple before the war even began.\"\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

He was declared successor to the Emperor Taizu in 916, but never succeeded to the throne. Rather, after the accession of his younger brother Yelü Deguang (Emperor Taizong), he fled to the Shatuo Later Tang, where he was killed in 937.\n\nYelü Bei was born in 899, before the founding of the Khitan empire (which would later become known as Liao Dynasty). His father was the Yelü clan chieftain Yelü Abaoji, and his mother was Yelü Abaoji's wife Shulü Ping; he was their first son. He was described by the \"History of Liao\" as intelligent and studious in his youth, with a relaxed appearance and a loving heart.\n\nIn 916, when Yelü Abaoji declared himself emperor of a new Khitan empire as its Emperor Taizu, he created Yelü Bei his crown prince. When Emperor Taizu inquired of his attendants which god he should first offer sacrifice to as part of his becoming emperor, his attendants largely advocated offering sacrifices to the Buddha. When Emperor Taizu pointed out that the Buddha was not a Chinese god, Yelü Bei advocated offering first to Confucius. Emperor Taizu was pleased by the suggestion and built a temple for Confucius, having Yelü Bei offer sacrifices to him twice a year.\n\nYelü Bei subsequently served as Emperor Taizu's forward commander in campaigns against the Wugu (烏古) and the Dangxiang tribes. Later, on incursions that Emperor Taizu made into the Chinese/Shatuo state Jin territory — specifically, Jin's Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing) — he left Yelü Bei in charge at his capital Linhuang Municipality (臨潢, in modern Chifeng, Inner Mongolia). It was during this time that Yelü Bei was said to have drafted a plan to conquer Khitan's eastern neighbor Balhae.\n\nIn 926, Emperor Taizu decided to carry out the plans to conquer Balhae. In a campaign, he captured the important Balhae city Fuyu (夫餘, in modern Siping, Jilin). (This appeared to have ended the Balhae state, even though Emperor Taizu did not at this time capture Balhae's capital Longquan.) Emperor Taizu set up a Dongdan Kingdom over the old Balhae territory, with its capital at Fuyu, and made Yelü Bei its king, with the title of \"Imperial King of Man\" (人皇王, \"Ren Huangwang\"), echoing the titles used by himself (\"Imperial Emperor of Heaven,\" 天皇帝, \"Tian Huangdi\") and his wife (Yelü Bei's mother) Empress Shulü (\"Imperial Empress of Earth,\" 地皇后, \"Di Huanghou\"). He gave his second son (Yelü Bei's younger brother) Yelü Deguang the title of \"Generalissimo Crown Prince\" and made Yelü Deguang in charge of Linhuang, replacing Yelü Bei.\n\nShortly after conquering Fuyu, however, Emperor Taizu fell ill and died while still at Fuyu. Empress Shulü took over effective leadership of the Khitan, and she and Yelü Bei began the trek of escorting Emperor Taizu's casket back to Linhuang, leaving one of Emperor Taizu's younger brother Yelü Anduan (耶律安端) temporarily in charge at Dongdan. Once then returned to Linhuang, she wanted to divert the succession away from Yelü Bei, as she had favored Yelü Deguang. However, formally, she called an assembly of the chieftains, along with Yelü Bei and Yelü Deguang, and stated to them, \"I love both of my sons, and I do not know which one to make emperor. You can decide which one you wish to support by holding his rein.\" The chieftains, knowing that she favored Yelü Deguang, rushed to him and held to his rein. She thereafter declared him emperor (as Emperor Taizong). Yelü Bei, angry over this turn of events, took several hundred soldiers and wanted to flee to Later Tang (Jin's successor state), but was intercepted by Khitan border guards. Empress Shulü (now empress dowager) did not punish him, but sent him to Dongdan.\n\nEmperor Taizong, after becoming emperor, became suspicious as to whether his older brother intended to take back the throne, and therefore moved Dongdan's capital to Dongping (東平, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning) and forcibly moved the former Balhae people to Dongping. He also put guards in place to monitor Yelü Bei's actions. When Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang heard this, he sent secret emissaries encouraging Yelü Bei to flee to Later Tang. Yelü Bei, commenting, \"I yielded the empire to the Emperor, but now I am under suspicion. It is better that I go to another state so that I can be like Wu Taibo.\" He thus took his favorite concubine Lady Gao and his extensive book collection, got into a ship, and sailed to Later Tang. In 930, he arrived at Later Tang's Deng Prefecture (登州, in modern Yantai, Shandong). (Yelü Bei's wife Imperial Queen Xiao and his oldest son Yelü Ruan did not follow him to Later Tang, and Imperial Queen Xiao would subsequently continue to rule the Dongdan state until her death in 940, while Yelü Ruan would eventually succeed Emperor Taizong after his death (as Emperor Shizong).)\n\nIn 931, Emperor Mingzong made Yelü Bei the military governor (\"Jiedushi\") of a newly created Huaihua Circuit (懷化, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), and gave him a new name of Dongdan Muhua. Later in the year, he changed the Dongdan Muhua name further to Li Zanhua, and that would be the name used by the Khitan prince for the rest of his life. However, there was no sign that Li Zanhua ever reported to Huaihua, and in 932, Emperor Mingzong instead stated an intention to give him a command south of the Yellow River. When the Later Tang officials opposed, Emperor Mingzong stated, \"His father and I agreed to be blood brothers, and that is why Zanhua came to me. I am now old. How would he have even come to a later emperor now matter how hard they enticed him?\" He thereafter made Li Zanhua the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (義成, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), but selected a talented staff to take effective governance of the circuit, allowing Li Zanhua not to carry out actual responsibilities. He also gave a concubine of his predecessor Emperor Zhuangzong's, Lady Xia, to Li Zanhua to be his new wife, and he also was lenient toward Li Zanhua such that even when Li Zanhua committed offenses, he would not punish Li Zanhua. However, it was said that Li Zanhua was cruel toward his concubines and servants — as he liked to drink blood, his concubines often had to injure themselves so that they would bleed for him to drink, and the servants would often suffer severe punishments, including having their eyes gouged out, being cut by swords, or being burnt by fire, for minor faults. Lady Xia eventually could not endure seeing this and, after requesting permission from Emperor Mingzong, divorced Li Zanhua and became a Buddhist nun. Despite his cruelty, however, Li Zanhua was also said to be highly talented. He understood fortunetelling and music, and was very talented in medicine. He could write in both the Khitan and Han languages, and translated the \"Huangdi Yinfujing\" into Khitan. He was particularly well known for his paintings of Khitan people and things, and many of his paintings eventually ended up in the palace collections of the Song Dynasty decades later. In 933, he was recalled from Yicheng and given the completely honorary title of military governor of Zhaoxin Circuit (昭信, headquartered in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi) (as Zhaoxin's territory was then ruled by Wu).\n\nDespite his having fled to Later Tang territory and becoming a Later Tang subject, Li Zanhua continued to maintain communications with his mother and brother, often sending emissaries to them. The communication went the other way around, too, as when his grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Yaonian died in 933, his mother and brother notified him of her death.\n\nAlso in 933, Emperor Mingzong died, and was initially succeeded by his biological son Li Conghou the Prince of Song (as Emperor Min). In 934, Emperor Mingzong's adoptive son Li Congke the Prince of Lu overthrew Emperor Min in a rebellion and became emperor. Li Zanhua was said to have secretly communicated to his brother Emperor Taizong the opinion that this was a good opportunity to invade Later Tang, although Emperor Taizong took no actions at that time.\n\nThroughout the years, apparently because of Li Zanhus'a presence in Later Tang and the fact that Later Tang had captured a number of important Khitan commanders, Empress Dowager Shulü had repeatedly sought \"heqin\" alliances between Khitan and Later Tang. In early 936, Li Congke, apprehensive over the prospect that his brother-in-law Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) might rebel and enlist Khitan aid in doing so, had his officials Li Song and Lü Qi (呂琦) draft a plan under which such an alliance would occur — but then abandoned the plan.\n\nLater in the year, Shi Jingtang did rebel, and Later Tang forces was initially successful in advancing to Hedong's capital Taiyuan Municipality and putting it under siege. However, they were thereafter crushed by aid troops that Emperor Taizong himself commanded and trapped by Khitan forces at Jin'an Base (晉安寨, near Taiyuan). When Li Congke sought advice from his officials, Long Min (龍敏) suggested that he create Li Zanhua the Emperor of Khitan and send an army to escort him back to Khitan territory, to create a second front that Khitan's Emperor Taizong would have to deal with. Li Congke gave initial approval to the plan, but the more powerful officials opposed, believing the plan to be useless, and nothing eventually came of it.\n\nEventually, Emperor Taizong created Shi the emperor of a new Later Jin (as its Emperor Gaozu), and Shi subsequently headed south, with Khitan aid, toward the Later Tang capital Luoyang. With Later Tang generals defecting to Later Jin in droves, Li Congke gathered his family and generals loyal to him to the palace, intending to commit suicide by burning down the palace. When he summoned Li Zanhua, however, Li Zanhua refused to join the mass suicide, so Li Congke sent the officer Li Yanshen (李彥紳) to kill Li Zanhua. After the new Later Jin emperor entered Luoyang, he mourned Li Zanhua, posthumously created Li Zanhua the Prince of Yan, and had his body delivered back to Khitan.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 2005, he was appointed as the director of the Topkapı Museum in Istanbul, until he retired in 2012.\n\nAs a descendant of a Crimean Tatar Mirza nobility from his mother, İlber Ortaylı's family fled Joseph Stalin's persecution and deportation, and was born in Bregenz, Austria in a refugee camp on 21 May 1947. He came to Turkey when he was 2 years old.\n\nİlber Ortayli is heir to a bilingual Turkish family so that he obtained German from his father and Russian from his mother. As a polyglot historian he has enough competency in Italian, English, French, Persian and also in Ottoman Turkish and Latin in order to fluently employ or maintain historical research with historical documents in the archives. His published articles are mainly in Turkish, German and French and various of them are translated in English.\n\nDuring his studies in Turkey, he also worked as a travel guide which according to him improved his approach to the history: cultivating his apprehension in practice and gave him an opportunity \"to give lecture on history\" to different groups of people from different backgrounds. He gives credit to his experiences as travel guide for writing \"popular history\" books and essays.\n\nHe made acquaintance with intellectuals both from Turkey and from other countries. Notable are Halil İnalcık, Murat Bardakçı, Irene Melikoff, Bernard Lewis, Andreas Tietze.\n\nA biographical book \"Zaman Kaybolmaz: İlber Ortaylı Kitabı\" (\"Time doesn't go wasted: A book of İlber Ortaylı\"), long journalistic conversation with Nilgün Uysal: including passages from his childhood; student years in Ankara, Vienna and Chicago; his recent reflections on near history events and also anecdotes from the years he was working as a travel guide all over Turkey is published in 2006.\n\nOrtaylı started elementary school at St. George's Austrian High School in İstanbul and then moved to Ankara Atatürk High School. He studied Public policy at Ankara University Mekteb-i Mülkiye (Faculty of Political Science) and then went to Vienna and attended University of Vienna. There he studied both Slawistik and Orientalistik and worked with Andreas Tietze. For his postgraduate studies, he went to Chicago and made his master's degree under the supervision of professor Halil İnalcık at the University of Chicago. He obtained his doctorate at Ankara University in the Faculty of Political Sciences. His doctoral thesis was \"Local Administration in the Tanzimat Period\" (1978). After his doctorate, he attended to the faculty at the School of Political Sciences of Ankara University. In 1979, he was appointed as associate professor. In 1982, he resigned from his position, protesting the academic policy of the government established after the 1980 Turkish coup d'état. After teaching at several universities in Turkey, Europe and Russia, in 1989 he returned to Ankara University and became professor of history and the head of the section of administrative history.\n\nAmong his interviews on TV, newspapers; Ortaylı’s critical discourse on Turkish intellectual and political figures became emblematically popular among public even as entertaining internet meme shared on social media such as humiliating notes written under his photograph as depiction of a superiour personality reacting to the ignorant others.\n\nBut his criticisms shouldn’t be confused with anti-intellectualism. Yet criticism of Turkish intellectuals is an old and an ongoing debate in Turkey and İlber Ortaylı may be put separate from other figures of Turkish media those who shape the public opinion as journalist commentators. He is one of very few to bring historical context -in respect to every subject in its own variety- to debates on contemporary social issues and debates so that his thoughts and opinions bring attention and his knowledge is praised widely among public.\n\nOrtaylı's published articles as diplomatic, cultural and intellectual history are briefly on:\n\"And also urban history like\" \"Latins of the Pera district of the Constantinople\" for Istanbul and various historical cities which were once under the Ottoman influence; history of provincial administration focusing on the transformation of institutions in the Ottoman Empire from the beginning to the 19th century. \n\nIn 2001, he received the Aydın Doğan Foundation Award for his work \"Family in the Ottoman History\".\n\nIn 2007, Medal of Pushkin given to him for his \"great contribution to the spread and study of the Russian language, the preservation of cultural heritage and the rapprochement and mutual enrichment of different nations’ and people's cultures\" under a decree signed by Vladimir Putin and announced officially by the Kremlin, the ceremony took place at the Russian Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nIn 2011, he was chosen as honorary member to the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\nHe is a member of the Foundation for International Studies, the Societas Iranologica Europeae and the Austrian-Turkish Academy of Sciences, (Economical and Social History Institute of Turkey)\n"}
