The unrest began as the recently suspended chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry arrived at the Jinnah International Airport on 12 May 2007. Gunfights and clashes erupted across the provincial capital as Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) , Awami National Party (ANP), and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PMAP) activists, who supported the judge, and the pro-government Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) activists took to the streets against each other. Government machinery was used to block all major roads. Police was accomplice and a silent spectator to the violence. News media was attacked at Guru mandir (Business Recorder Road) when MQM activists began firing at AAJ TV headquarters which was shown on live television.\n\nChaudhry's supporters had announced a public rally to welcome the judge while at the same time, the MQM also announced a demonstration of their own to protest against the politicisation of the issue of judge's suspension. The MQM made plans to deliberately converge at the mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Jinnah where the chief justice was to make an appearance to address a lawyers' convention and a bar association meeting at the 50th anniversary of the Sindh High Court Bar Association.\n\nBefore the citywide riots escalated, several roads were cordoned off and all routes to the airport were blocked to avoid clashes between groups. In the carnage that ensued, armed groups did a lot of carnage, cars were burnt and buildings smashed into while the ensuing gunfights left more than 40 people killed with several hundred injured and arrested. The violence continued for several days, culminating in events that led to the historic Lawyers' Movement.\n\nSeveral lawmakers and analysts have since questioned the incompetence of the city's security apparatus on the day of the riots and the complicity of MQM in giving rise to the riots. The MQM officially denied starting the chaos and blamed it on the PPP, ANP, PMAP, Punjabi Pakhtun Ittehad (PPI) and Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) activists.\n\nIn the first few months of 2007, several conflicts had already raged between chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry and the Pakistani government, particularly with regard to the Pakistan Steel Mills corruption case where the chief justice ruled against the sale of the state-owned steel mills at a \"throw-away price\". Issues pertaining to the privatisation of the state-owned steel mills upset Shaukat Aziz, who served as the prime minister under the Musharraf administration.\n\nWhat irked president Pervez Musharraf however was the controversial Missing Persons case that found Pakistan's intelligence agencies (including the FIA and the ISI) to be complicit in the forced disappearances of up to 400 people (including terror suspects and human rights activists) without due process since 2001. Under Chaudhry's leadership, the courts had increasingly started \"exercising independence from the government\" when it ordered the security agencies to produce the missing people in court.\n\nWhen the Musharraf administration asked the judge to quit, Chaudhry refused to go. On 9 March 2007, Musharraf had no other choice but to suspend Chaudhry from his post for alleged and unspecified charges of misconduct and misuse of authority. The sacking of the head of the judiciary sparked bloody protests throughout Pakistan and \"edged the country towards a constitutional crisis\". The civil unrest grew with regards to the validity of the allegations as well as doubts as to whether Musharraf had the power to suspend the chief justice. It was on these grounds that Chaudhry waged a legal battle in the Supreme Court seeking his reinstatement. He called his suspension a \"thinly veiled assault on the independence of judiciary in Pakistan\".\n\nOn 5 May 2007, in showing solidarity with the former chief justice, a motorcade of Chaudhry's supporters rode with him from Islamabad to Lahore where he was expected to speak at the Lahore High Court Bar Association when this motorcade of over 2,000 vehicles was stopped by the police with baton charges and tear gas shelling. Debates concerning the day's events started being covered and discussed on the Pakistani news media.\n\nThe government wanted to limit the media coverage of Chaudhry's rallies and asked the Supreme Court to warn news networks that any \"media coverage, discussion and analysis\" that impeded legal procedures would be treated as contempt of court. The court issued a statement in which it said the news media, and in particular Geo TV host Kamran Khan, had broadcast \"sensational reporting aimed at scandalising and maligning the honourable judges of the Supreme Court\". Khan defended his actions by saying he had no malicious intent. But when discussions of the Chaudhry's rallies persisted on television, the government decided to take drastic measures and abruptly pulled Geo TV and Aaj TV off air.\n\nIt wasn't until 9 May 2007 that the Pakistani government imposed a complete ban on the media from discussing the suspension of Chaudhry by Musharraf. Media outlets and journalists protested and responded to the ban saying that their goal was to cover, not contribute, to the controversy. The government, reluctantly, agreed to issue special passes for reporters and lawyers to attend the presidential reference filed against the chief justice. Several pro-government parties throughout Pakistan announced their own demonstrations to coincide with Chaudhry's rallies.\n\nIn anticipation of the former chief justice's arrival in Lahore, the Lahore High Court was thronged by political activists of several political parties in the opposition including Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N), Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), who had gathered to welcome the judge. When Chaudhry did arrive at the Lahore High Court, his motorcade was swamped by supporters showering his vehicle with rose petals and chanting \"Go Musharraf, Go!\" Banners denouncing Musharraf were hung all around the compound.\n\nIn his historical speech on 6 May 2007, the former chief justice made no direct references to president Musharraf but directed his rhetoric towards the government by calling it a \"dictatorship\". Several political commentators refer to this speech as the precursor to the Lawyers' Movement later that year. Chaudhry also accused the government of violating the basic human rights of its citizens and warned that the countries and nations that don't learn from past mistakes were bound to be destroyed. In closing his speech, Chaudhry announced he would be attending a Sindh High Court Bar Association meeting in Karachi on 12 May 2007.\n\nAfter Chaudhry announced his plans for Karachi, the political parties in the opposition announced a rally to welcome the former chief justice in their city. Upon seeing Chaudhry's supporters announce a rally to welcome the chief justice, the pro-government Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) organised a protest demonstration of their own against the \"politicisation of the issue [of the justice's suspension]\".\n\nSeeing the chief justice's determination to visit Karachi, MQM MNA Nawab Mirza proclaimed in a parliamentary session that \"no one [would] be allowed to do anything in Karachi.\" He said that \"[the] country [may belong] to everyone, but Karachi [belonged] to [the MQM]\". The provincial government called a meeting of the senior officials and instructed them to not let the chief justice leave the airport at any cost. Sindh chief secretary Shakil Durrani learnt of these plans and called them a \"contempt of the High Court's orders\".\n\nOn 10 May 2007, Pakistan International Human Rights Organisation filed a petition with the Sindh High Court pointing out reports in the press about Sindh home secretary Ghulam M. Muhtaram Naqvi's letter to the chief justice that requested him to postpone his visit because of intelligence reports suggesting threat of a terrorist attack. The court directed the federal and provincial governments to provide fool-proof security to the chief justice and also directed authorities not to pressurise him into changing his route while also keeping him informed of any security risks.\n\nAt on 10 May 2007, the residence of the Supreme Court Bar Association president Munir A. Malik came under attack by armed men. Malik, a member of the panel of lawyers defending Chaudhry, narrowly escaped the attack. On 11 May 2007, Karachi Bar Association vice president Ziauddin Sardar was reported missing by his family. Following these incidents, uncertainty and fear gripped the city as the \"threat of a showdown loomed large\".\n\nKarachi Police informed it had arrested 150 people under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance on apprehensions they could \"create problems\" on the judge's arrival. However, opposition parties disputed the number of arrests – MMA put the figure at 500, PPP at 400 and PML-N at 150.\n\nFearing a showdown between rival political parties, the transporters in the city decided to keep their buses and vans off the road. In a late-night announcement, the Sindh government announced the closure of all educational institutions as governor Dr Ishrat-ul-Ibad Khan declared a public holiday for government and private schools, colleges and universities on 12 May 2007. Hospitals declared emergency and ordered their doctors and staff to remain on duty, while Naib Nazima Nasreen Jalil directed all city departments including hospitals and fire-brigade to follow \"standard operating procedure\" to deal with any emergency situation that arises.\n\nReports started emerging from around Karachi of blockades being set up on the way toward the Jinnah International Airport in a bid to stop the chief justice from visiting Muhammad Ali Jinnah's mausoleum. Parts of Shahrah-e-Quaideen were blocked whereas the main arterial road Shahrah-e-Faisal, which was to be used by procession of the chief justice, was completely made inaccessible.\n\nBecause most of the road leading to the airport were closed, the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) had to delay all its flight due to the non-availability of cockpit and cabin crews who were unable to reach the airport in time. It wasn't just air traffic that was suspended but train services between Karachi and the rest of the country were also effected.\n\nAt , Chaudhry left Islamabad airport on flight PK-301 for Karachi accompanied by Zamurad Khan and Yousuf Talpur. The flight landed at the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi airport at .\n\nGunfights broke out throughout the city as soon as the plane landed at the airport; several vehicles were also set ablaze. Smoke rose from at least four different areas of the city where competing rallies were organised.\n\nThe chief justice had plans to visit Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah's mausoleum to address a gathering and then to the Sindh High Court to address lawyers at the 50th anniversary of the Sindh High Court Bar Association. Due to the sudden violence that erupted throughout the city, the chief justice was unable to leave the airport.\n\nAs the violence escalated, gunfights moved toward the Guru Mandir Square in the neighbourhood of Jamshed Quarters. The offices of various media outlets, in particular the Business Recorder House which housed the Aaj TV newsroom and broadcast operations, became firsthand witnesses of the carnage. With the violence continuing right at their doorstep, Aaj TV reporters began telecasting live footage of the mayhem.\n\nThe Aaj TV footage showed armed men brandishing weapons that they fired indiscriminately at rivals in an adjacent neighbourhood. The footage clearly showed these gunmen hoisting MQM flags. As soon as the footage started airing on television, the gunmen became aware they were being filmed and turned their guns towards the media offices. The armed men fired at the office building and set cars ablaze in the parking lot beside the building.\n\nThe network's chief executive Arshad Zuberi later revealed that the gunmen were certainly affiliated with the MQM. He stated that the \"gunmen started [firing] indiscriminately at [the] office [and] no security was sent [even] though the firing went on for six hours\". According to Zuberi, the armed men had wanted to stop the airing of the live footage. Nevertheless, the network remained on air uninterrupted and no one was hurt during the attacks.\n\nIn an editorial for the Daily Times, freelance journalist Urooj Zia wrote an eyewitness account of the carnage outside the Business Recorder House. She observed how the Rangers paramilitary force had let the violence continue under their noses. She mentioned how people were being stopped at gunpoint on the street by political activists and asked for identification while the police stood by idly.\n\nDuring the rampage, it was mostly the supporters of Chaudhry who lost their lives. 15 members of Awami National Party (ANP) were killed (Pashtuns make up second largest ethnic group in Karachi with 7.0 millions pashtuns live in karachi). 14 supporters of PPP were also left dead in the massacre.\n\nMore than 800 political workers were arrested, majority of whom were members of labor and student organizations that had been planning to greet Chaudhry on his arrival.\n\nUnable to leave the airport, the chief justice took refuge at the airport. Knowing that roads leading up to the airport were blocked and that his leaving may further precipitate bloodshed, Chaudhry's advisers asked him to stay put. Amidst the chaos, the government agreed to send a helicopter to transport him out of the airport but Chaudhry refused, indicating that he wished to travel by ground.\n\nAccording to Munir A. Malik, one of the lawyers accompanying Chaudhry, Musharraf's offer to transport Chaudhry by helicopter seemed more like an attempt to \"kidnap\" the chief justice.\n\nAfter a whole day of violence in the city, the Sindh administration issued a notification in the evening ordering the deportation of the chief justice. It was at this moment that Chaudhry \"abandoned plans to address [his] supporters\" and returned to Islamabad on the next flight. The chief justice was adamant that he would only leave the airport if he was provided with sufficient security and the accompaniment of his cadre of lawyers. Chaudhry's flight departed the Karachi airport at around .\n\nAccording to Aitzaz Ahsan, a prominent figurehead in Chaudhry's cadre, the chief justice had waited all day for permission to go to the Sindh High Court but was rather mistreated and asked to leave. He also accused the MQM of planning the mayhem in advance.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, a non-government affiliated human rights watch dog based in New York City, recently issued a statement indicating that \"This [violence] can either be due to the incompetence of the government, or its complicity.\" Their statement went on, \"The sequence of events leading up to this violence, including statements from the provincial authorities and the arrest of hundreds of opposition activists in the last few days, indicates that the government, acting through its coalition partners, has deliberately sought to foment violence in Karachi.\" \n\nAccording to documents obtained by the BBC after the event, government security measures on the day of the planned demonstrations included the instruction that \"no police personnel should carry any kind of weapon during the law and order duty with the rally\".\n\nOf note, among police officials were deployed for security duties in Karachi, only 21 in the entire city were armed. BBC analysts have indicated that the way police were deployed indicates that they were meant to prevent people from gaining access to the airport or to the Sindh High Court.\n\nMost of the city remained calm the day following the riots as security forces in armored personnel carriers and pickup trucks with mounted machine guns patrolled mostly peaceful and deserted streets. Tensions were still high with the government authorising paramilitary troops to shoot anyone involved in \"serious\" violence. Political opponents in the parliament blamed one another for the May 12 mayhem. MQM's Farooq Sattar blamed the opposition by saying that they were a \"hundred percent, 200 percent\" responsible for the situation in Karachi.\n\nOn the other hand, opposition senator Mushahid Ullah Khan held the MQM responsible for the attacks in Karachi. National Party senator and senior vice president Hasil Bizenjo underscored the need for an inquiry into the incidents. An editorial in the Daily Times said, “the possibility of any compromise to correct [Musharraf's] original mistake [of removing the chief justice] has vanished now ... the ante has been upped by the government.”\n\nAt around on 13 May 2007, Supreme Court additional registrar Syed Hammad Raza was shot dead near his home in Islamabad. Raza was a close associate of Chaudhry and a vital witness in the case against Chaudhry's suspension. After leaving Karachi, the chief justice visited Raza's widow Shabana the same night to present his condolences. Reuters reported Shabana telling Chaudhry, \"You called him to Islamabad. You should have protected him, and now my children need protection as well.” According to Chaudhry's lawyer Tariq Mehmood, Raza was a prime witness in the case as he had witnessed the removal of files from the chief justice's chambers on the day of his suspension. He said that \"[Raza] was under pressure.\"\n\nOn 13 May 2007, opposition parties observed a \"black day\" and called for a general strike in Punjab on 14 May 2007. The leaders of PPP, PML-N, MMA, PTI, ANP, PMAP, and the Khaksar Tehrik called for action against the miscreants that spread violence on May 12 calling them \"killers\". The Punjab leadership of the MMA held the Sindh government responsible for the loss of lives. The May 14 strikes in Lahore paralysed the city as opposition activists protested against the government response to the riots. 8,000 people, including lawyers and human rights activists, chanted \"Out with Musharraf!\" and \"Death to Altaf Hussain!\" In addition, protestors burned effigies of Musharraf and hundreds forced their way through a police barricade.\n\nAuthorities responded by banning demonstrations and declaring a national holiday. Shops were closed and public transportation was shut down in the country’s major cities. It is the largest strike in Pakistan since Musharraf assumed his presidency in 1999, with much of the unrest stemming from news reports that government troops were in Karachi,\n\nAt a press conference on 14 May 2007, Sindh chief minister Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim assured that the situation in Karachi was under control and that there had been no serious incidents of violence in the days following the initial May 12 riots, despite fears to the contrary. The chief minister also indicated that opposition parties had not sought permission from the provincial government to hold their rallies on 12 May 2007. He also said the general elections would be held as scheduled in a few months and accused the opposition of showing impatience in that regard.\n\nRahim also revealed that the police had arrested former DIG Rana Saleemullah Khan on court orders. Khan had been a vocal advocate of the chief justice and was Chaudhry's witness with regards to the Mannu Bheel case. He was one of the two witnesses in that case, alongside the recently killed Syed Hammad Raza. Khan feared that his arrest was a façade and a sham, and that he could become another victim of extrajudicial killing. There had been several reports that Khan was humiliated after his arrest.\n\nOn 3 June 2007, the government announced that it would impose a ban on any televised live talk show that discusses the issue of the chief justice's suspension. It threatened to take punitive action against broadcasters that displayed an anti-state or anti-national stance and cast \"aspersions on the integrity of the armed forces\". Under Musharraf's decree, the government amended the PEMRA Ordinance to impose these new restrictions on private television channels on 4 June 2007. Opposition parties and lawyers campaigned against these amendments and observed a \"black day\" in solidarity with the broadcasters and journalists. Amongst the petitioners was the civil rights activist Syed Mohammad Iqbal Kazmi who had recently filed a petition in the Sindh High Court on the May 12 violence.\n\nKazmi was abducted by unidentified persons on 6 June 2007 after he had filed his petition against the PEMRA ordinance. He was later released by his abductors on the condition that he would leave Karachi along with his family. However upon his release, Kazmi revealed that the reason for his abduction was rather his petition on the May 12 violence. He told of his harrowing ordeal where he was quizzed about his association with Imran Khan's PTI and the reasons as to why he named MQM founder and chief Altaf Hussain in his petition. His petition had also included the names of several other major political and government figures as respondents alongside Hussain. The named respondents included Sindh chief minister Arbab Ghulam Rahim, federal interior secretary Syed Kamal Shah, adviser to Sindh CM on home affairs Waseem Akhtar, chief secretary Shakeel Durrani, home secretary Ghulam M. Muhtaram Naqvi, provincial police officer Niaz A. Siddiqui, CCPO Azhar A. Farooqui, and the SHOs of City Courts and Jamshed Quarters police stations.\n\nAlongside Kazmi's petition, the Sindh High Court initiated its own suo moto proceedings issuing contempt of court notices to the federal interior secretary, Sindh chief secretary and home secretary, AIGP (acting PPO), Town Police Officer and other officials who were responsible for maintaining law and order on 12 May 2007. Subsequently, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also moved an identical contempt of court application.\n\nA seven-member bench was constituted to preside over the case. The bench included justices Sarmad Jalal Osmany, Anwar Zaheer Jamali, Mushir Alam, Azizullah M. Memon, Khilji Arif Hussain, Maqbool Baqar and Ali Sain Dino Metlo, who were authorised to probe into the several issues that resulted in the May 12 bloodshed.\nNo main culprit in this case was ever arrested. MQM Altaf Hussian is enjoying his life in United Kingdom, former President General (retired) Musharraf is spending his time in Dubai, Europe and United States, Chief Minister Sindh Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim went to Dubai in 2008 and came back Karachi in 2013, Governor Sindh Ishratul Ibad Khan ruled the province as Governor till 2016 and now traveling in and out of country while the then Adviser to the Sindh Chief Minister on Home Affairs Waseem Akhtar is now ruling Karachi as its Mayor.\n\n\n"}

It succeeded the Renaissance and preceded the Age of Enlightenment. It is often considered to be part of early modern philosophy.\n\nThe period is usually taken to start in the seventeenth century with the work of René Descartes, who set much of the agenda as well as much of the methodology for those who came after him. The period is typified in Europe by the great system-builders — philosophers who present unified systems of epistemology, metaphysics, logic, and ethics, and often politics and the physical sciences too. Immanuel Kant classified his predecessors into two schools: the rationalists and the empiricists, and early modern philosophy is often characterised in terms of a conflict between these schools.\n\nThe three main rationalists are normally taken to have been Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, and Gottfried Leibniz. Building upon their English predecessors Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes, the three main empiricists were John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. The former were distinguished by the belief that, in principle (though not in practice), all knowledge can be gained by the power of our reason alone; the latter rejected this, believing that all knowledge has to come through the senses, from experience. Thus the rationalists took mathematics as their model for knowledge, and the empiricists took the physical sciences. \n\nThis period also saw the birth of some of the classics of political philosophy, especially Thomas Hobbes' \"Leviathan\", and John Locke's \"Two Treatises of Government\".\n\nThe seventeenth century in Europe saw the culmination of the slow process of detachment of philosophy from theology. Thus, while philosophers still talked about – and even offered arguments for the existence of – a deity, this was done in the service of philosophical argument and thought. (In the Enlightenment, the \"Age of Reason\", 18th-century philosophy was to go still further, leaving theology and religion behind altogether.)\n\n"}

{"id": "2658444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2658444", "title": "9/11 Truth movement", "text": "9/11 Truth movement\n\nAdherents of the 9/11 Truth movement are conspiracy theorists who dispute the mainstream account of the September 11 attacks of 2001. The group disputes the commonly accepted account that Al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners, crashed them into the Pentagon and New York's Twin Towers, whereupon the crashes led to the collapse of the Twin Towers. The primary focus is on missed information that they allege is not adequately explained in the official NIST theory, such as the collapse of World Trade Center 7. They suggest a cover-up and, at the least, complicity by insiders.\n\nThey analyze evidence from the attacks, discuss different theories about how the attacks happened and call for a new investigation into the attacks. Some of the organizations assert that there is evidence that individuals within the United States government may have been either responsible for or knowingly complicit in the September 11 attacks. Motives suggested by the movement include the use of the attacks as a pretext to fight wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and to create opportunities to curtail American civil liberties. Support for the movement is negligible from professionals in relevant fields, such as civil and aerospace engineering.\n\n\"9/11 Truth movement\" is the collective name of loosely affiliated organizations and individuals that question whether the United States government, agencies of the United States or individuals within such agencies were either responsible for or purposefully complicit in the September 11 attacks. The term is also being used by the adherents of the movement, who call themselves \"9/11 skeptics\", \"truth activists\", or \"9/11 Truthers\", while generally rejecting the term \"conspiracy theorists\".\nAdherents of the 9/11 Truth movement come from diverse social backgrounds. The movement draws adherents from people of diverse political beliefs including liberals, conservatives, and libertarians.\n\nLev Grossman of \"Time\" magazine has stated that support for the 9/11 Truth movement is not a \"fringe phenomenon\", but \"a mainstream political reality.\" Others, such as Ben Smith of \"Politico\" and the \"Minneapolis Star Tribune\" have stated that the movement has been \"relegated to the fringe\". \"The Washington Post\" editorial staff went further describing the movement as \"lunatic fringe.\" Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor and author of the book \"Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture\", says that \"the amount of organisation\" of the movement is significantly stronger than the organization of the movement related to doubts about the official account of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, though this is likely the result of new media technologies, such as online social networks, blogs, etc.\n\nThe 9/11 Truth movement is active in the United States as well as in other countries.\n\nIn 2004, John Buchanan ran for president on a 9/11 Truth platform. Jeff Boss ran in the 2012 US presidential election on a 9/11 Truth platform.\n\nIn a 2011 article in \"Skeptical Inquirer\", Bartlett and Miller do an overview and analyze the members of the 9/11 Truth movement community. The authors find that people involved in this movement, which seemingly is a disparate group with very diversified backgrounds, could be classified into three groups. They join the movement for different reasons, loosely self-assemble to fill different roles, and are united by their shared mistrust in experts and the establishment (government and reputable sources of knowledge) and conspiratorial stance. Through their engagement, they each find their own fulfillment and satisfaction. Together, they contribute to the persistence, resilience, and exaggerated claims of acceptance (in general public) of the movement.\n\nMany adherents of the 9/11 Truth movement suspect that United States government insiders played a part in the attacks, or may have known the attacks were imminent, and did nothing to alert others or stop them. Some within the movement who argue that insiders within the United States government were directly responsible for the September 11 attacks often allege that the attacks were planned and executed in order to provide the U.S. with a pretext for going to war in the Middle East, and, by extension, as a means of consolidating.\n\nAccording to these allegations, this would have given the Bush administration the justification for more widespread abuses of civil liberties and to invade Afghanistan and Iraq to ensure future supplies of oil. In some cases, even in the mainstream media, \"hawks\" in the White House—especially former Vice President Dick Cheney, and members of the \"Project for the New American Century\", a neoconservative think tank—have been accused of involvement in, or awareness of, the alleged plot.\n\nMany adherents of the 9/11 Truth movement allege that the buildings of the World Trade Center were destroyed by controlled demolition, a theory of major importance for the 9/11 Truth movement.\n\nThe Internet plays a large role both in the communication between adherents and between local groups of the 9/11 Truth movement and in the dissemination of the views of the movement to the public at large. Colorado Public Television has aired several films produced by the movement such as \"9/11 Explosive Evidence: Experts Speak Out\", a documentary produced by Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, which once was one of the \"most shared\" and \"most watched\" programs on the national PBS site. The station's airing of such films has been controversial for the affiliate and PBS.\n\nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, different interpretations of the events that questioned the account given by the U.S. government were published. Among others, Michael Ruppert and Canadian journalist Barrie Zwicker, published criticisms or pointed out purported anomalies of the accepted account of the attacks. French author Jean-Charles Brisard and German authors Mathias Bröckers and Andreas von Bülow published books critical of media reporting and advancing the controlled demolition thesis of the destruction of the World Trade Center towers. In September 2002, the first \"Bush Did It!\" rallies and marches were held in San Francisco and Oakland, California organized by The All People's Coalition.\nIn October 2004, the organization \"9/11 Truth\" released a statement, signed by nearly 200 people, including many relatives of people who perished on September 11, 2001, that calls for an investigation into the attacks. It also asserted that unanswered questions would suggest that people within the administration of President George W. Bush may have deliberately allowed the attacks to happen. Actor Edward Asner, former presidential candidate Ralph Nader, former congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, former assistant secretary of housing Catherine Austin Fitts, author Richard Heinberg, Enver Masud, founder of The Wisdom Fund, professors Richard Falk of the University of California, Mark Crispin Miller of New York University, Douglas Sturm of Bucknell University, Burns H. Weston of the University of Iowa College of Law and others signed the statement. In 2009, Van Jones, a former advisor to President Obama, said he hadn't fully reviewed the statement before he signed and that the petition did not reflect his views \"now or ever.\"\n\nIn 2006, Steven E. Jones, who became a leading academic voice of the demolition theory, published the paper \"Why Indeed Did the WTC Buildings Completely Collapse?\". He was placed on paid leave by Brigham Young University following what they described as Jones's \"increasingly speculative and accusatory\" statements in September 2006, pending a review of his statements and research. Six weeks later, Jones retired from the university. Skepticism arose as to the scientific claims made by Jones and the efficacy of the peer-review process involved in the publication of his hypotheses, and conspiracy theorists responded to criticism by positing still more elaborate ostensible cover-ups.\n\nIn the same year, 61 legislators in the U.S. State of Wisconsin signed a petition calling for the dismissal of a University of Wisconsin lecturer Kevin Barrett, after he joined the group \"Scholars for 9/11 Truth\". Citing academic freedom, the university provost declined to take action against Barrett.\n\nSeveral organizations of family members of people who have died in the attacks are calling for an independent investigation into the attacks. In 2009, a group of people, including 9/11 Truth movement activist Lorie Van Auken and others who have lost friends or relatives in the attack, appealed to the City of New York to investigate the disaster. \"The New York City Coalition for Accountability Now\" collected signatures to require the New York City Council to place the creation of an investigating commission on the November 2009 election ballot. The group collected more than enough signatures to put the proposal before the voters, but New York Supreme Court Justice Edward Lehner stated that the petition overstepped what is allowable by city law, and ruled that, despite wording in the petition to allow for elements ruled invalid to be stricken, it would not be allowed to appear on the ballot.\n\nTo the consternation of the families and adherents of the 9/11 Truth movement, many of the questions that the 9/11 Family Steering Committee put to the 9/11 Commission, chaired by former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, were not asked in either the hearings nor in the Commission Report. Lorie Van Auken, one of the Jersey Girls, estimates that only 30% of their questions were answered in the final 9/11 Commission Report, published July 22, 2004.\n\nThe 9/11 Family Steering Committee produced a website summarizing the questions they had raised to the Commission, indicating which they believe had been answered satisfactorily, which they believe had been addressed but not answered satisfactorily, and which they believe had been generally ignored in or omitted from the Report.\n\nIn addition, the 339-page book, \"The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions\", by David Ray Griffin, claimed the report had either omitted information or distorted the truth, providing 115 examples of his allegations. He has characterized the 9/11 Commission Report as \"a 571-page lie\".\n\nOn May 26, 2008 adjunct religious studies professor Blair Gadsby began a protest and a hunger strike outside the offices of Senator and Republican Party nominee for President John McCain's office requesting McCain meet with the principal scientists and leaders of the 9/11 Truth movement, specifically Richard Gage, Steven Jones, and David Ray Griffin. McCain had written the foreword to the book \"Debunking 9/11 Myths: Why Conspiracy Theories Can't Stand Up to the Facts\", published by the magazine \"Popular Mechanics\".\n\nArizona Republican State Senator Karen Johnson joined the protest in support. On June 10, Johnson with Gadsby as her guest and other 9/11 Truth movement members in the audience, spoke before the Arizona State Senate espousing the controlled demolition theory and supporting a reopening of the 9/11 investigation. In response to a question, McCain said he did not meet Gadsby, adding: \"Because I don't take well to threats.\"\n\nFollowing the initial government investigation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Report (May 2002) NIST Report, numerous responses were written by members of the 9/11 Truth movement. Many of these responses claimed that it ignored key evidence suggesting an explosive demolition, \"distorted reality\" by using deceptive language and diagrams, and attacked straw man arguments, such as the 2005 article by Jim Hoffman entitled \"Building a better mirage: NIST's 3-year $20,000,000 Cover Up of the Crime of the Century\".\n\nIn late 2005, Steven E. Jones, then a professor at Brigham Young University, announced a paper criticizing the NIST Report and describing his hypothesis that the WTC towers had been intentionally demolished by explosives. This paper garnered some mainstream media attention, including an appearance by Jones on MSNBC. This was the first such programming on a major cable news station. Jones was criticized by his university for making his claims public before vetting them through the approved peer review process. He was placed on paid leave and has since retired.\n\nAccordingly, in April 2007, some 9/11 victims' family members and some members of the new \"Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice\" submitted an additional request for correction to NIST, containing their own views on the defects in the report. NIST responded to this request in September 2007 supporting their original conclusions; the originators of the request wrote back to them in October 2007, asking them to reconsider their response.\n\nMembers of the movement distributed pamphlets that they say told the \"truth\" about the attacks at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum when the Museum opened in May 2014.\n\nSince the publication of the official reports, a number of interconnected 9/11 Truth movement organizations have been formed.\n\nArchitects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth is an organization of architectural and engineering professionals who support the World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories and are calling for a new investigation into the destruction of the Twin Towers and WTC 7. The group is collecting signatures for a petition to the United States Congress that demands \"a truly independent investigation with subpoena power\" of the September 11 attacks, which, according to the organization, should include an inquiry into the possible use of explosives in the destruction of the World Trade Center buildings. Richard Gage, a San Francisco Bay area-based architect, founded \"Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth\" in 2006.\n\nInvestigations by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) have concluded that the buildings collapsed as a result of the impacts of the planes and of the fires that resulted from them. Gage criticized the government agency NIST for not having investigated the complete sequence of the collapse of the World Trade Center towers and claims \"the official explanation of the total destruction of the World Trade Center skyscrapers has explicitly failed to address the massive evidence for explosive demolition.\" To support its position, the group Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth points to the \"free fall\" pace of the collapse of the buildings, the \"lateral ejection of steel\", and to the \"mid-air pulverization of concrete\", among other things.\n\n\"9/11 Truth\" was launched in June 2004 and has become a central portal for many 9/11 Truth movement organizations. It is run by Janice Matthews (Executive Director), David Kubiak (International Campaign Advisor) and Mike Berger (Media Coordinator), among others, and its advisory board includes Steven E. Jones and Barrie Zwicker.\n\nThe organization co-sponsored opinion polls conducted by the U.S. market research and opinion polling firm Zogby International that have shown substantial numbers of people believing the government did not tell the full truth about the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe original \"Scholars for 9/11 Truth\" was founded by James H. Fetzer, a former philosophy professor, and physicist Steven E. Jones, in December 2005. It was a group of people of varying backgrounds and expertise who rejected the mainstream media and government account of the September 11 attacks. Initially the group invited many ideas and hypotheses to be considered. However, leading members soon came to feel that the inclusion of some theories advocated by Fetzer — such as the use of directed energy weapons or miniature nuclear bombs to destroy the Twin Towers—were insufficiently supported by evidence and were exposing the group to ridicule. By December 2006, Jones and others set up a new scholars group, Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice, whose focus is to use scientific analysis. The original members took a vote on which group to join and the majority voted to move to the new group.\n\nScholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice (STJ) formed in January 2007 and is a self-described \"group of scholars and supporters endeavoring to address the unanswered questions of the September 11, 2001 attack through scientific research and public education\". The group is composed of more than 900 members, including Richard Gage, Steven E. Jones, Jim Hoffman, David Ray Griffin, Peter Phillips, and former Congressman Daniel Hamburg. Most members support the conspiracy theory that the World Trade Center Towers and the third skyscraper, WTC 7, were destroyed through explosive demolition. \n\nIn 2008 and 2009, several members of the Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice published essays in science and engineering journals. In April 2008, a letter by some of its members, was published in \"The Open Civil Engineering Journal\". In July 2008, an article by Steven E. Jones and others was published in \"The Environmentalist.\"\n\nIn October 2008, a comment by STJ member James R. Gourley describing what he considers fundamental errors in a Bažant and Verdure paper was included in an issue of the \"Journal of Engineering Mechanics\". In April 2009, Danish chemist and STJ member Niels H. Harrit, of the University of Copenhagen, and eight other authors, including some STJ members, published a paper in \"The Open Chemical Physics Journal\", entitled \"Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe\". The paper, which caused the editor and only peer-reviewer, Professor Pileni, to resign, claiming it was published without her knowledge, concludes that chips consisting of unreacted and partially reacted nano-thermite (\"super-thermite\") appear to be present in samples of the dust. \n\n9/11 Citizens Watch was formed in 2002 by John Judge and Kyle Hence and, along with the Family Steering Committee, played an active role in calling for the establishment of the 9/11 Commission, and monitoring the commission closely.\nFounded in 2011 by Senator Mike Gravel, the 9/11 Commission Campaign's objective is to enact subpoena-capable, state-level commissions through state ballot initiatives, namely in Oregon, Alaska and California. These commissions are envisioned as citizen-driven, independent organizations that would form a semi-unified grassroots national presence by exercising joint powers authority.\n\nThe Hispanic Victims Group is a group created after the 9/11 attacks, founded by William Rodriguez, a supporter of the 9/11 Truth movement. The group was one of the key forces behind the creation of the 9/11 Commission. William Rodriguez, as founder of the group, was a member of the Families Advisory Council for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC).\n\nMembers of the 9/11 truth organizations, such as 911truth.org and Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice, regularly hold meetings and conferences to discuss ongoing research about 9/11 and to strategize about how best to achieve their goals. Many of these conferences are organized by 911truth.org, and some have been covered by the international media.\n\nMatt Taibbi of \"Rolling Stone\" assessed that the movement \"gives supporters of Bush an excuse to dismiss critics of this administration\", and expressed concerns about the number of people who believe in 9/11 conspiracy theories.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) engineering professor Thomas W. Eagar was at first unwilling to acknowledge the concerns of the movement, saying that \"if (the argument) gets too mainstream, I'll engage in the debate\". In response to Steven E. Jones' publication of a hypothesis that the World Trade Center was destroyed by controlled demolition, Eagar said that adherents of the 9/11 Truth movement would use the reverse scientific method to arrive at their conclusions, as they \"determine what happened, throw out all the data that doesn't fit their conclusion, and then hail their findings as the only possible conclusion\".\n\nCalling conspiracy theorists \"the truthers\", Bill Moyers has quoted journalist Robert Parry by stating that the theorists \"...threw out all the evidence of al-Qaeda's involvement, from contemporaneous calls from hijack victims on the planes to confessions from al-Qaeda leaders both in and out of captivity that they had indeed done it. Then, recycling some of the right's sophistry techniques, such as using long lists of supposed evidence to overcome the lack of any real evidence, the 'truthers' cherry-picked a few supposed 'anomalies' to build an 'inside-job' story line\".\n\nAl-Qaeda has sharply criticized Iran's ex-president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, over his suggestions that the U.S. government was behind the September 11 attacks, dismissing his comments as \"ridiculous\".\n\nSome skeptics —who oppose conspiracy as the \"a priori\" explanation to events, and who find most of the questions posed by the Truthers to be either easily answered or based on misleading or false ideas—have claimed that some of the Truthers are knowingly disseminating false information with no care for the grieving families, and have accordingly called them \"disrespectful\" or even \"sickos\".\n\nA prominent author of the 9/11 Truth movement literature is theologian David Ray Griffin. His two books, \"The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions about the Bush Administration and 9/11\" (March 2004), which claimed to outline a methodical, deductive framework for researching 9/11, and \"The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions\" (October 2004), became best-sellers.\n\nGriffin's \"Debunking 9/11 Debunking\" (May 2007) looks at the way magazines such as \"Popular Mechanics\" have sought to debunk the alternative 9/11 theories. His 2008 book, \"The New Pearl Harbor Revisited: 9/11, the cover-up, and the exposé\", was written to update his original book, \"The New Pearl Harbor\", reflecting information and insights from five major developments that have occurred since his original publication, while \"The Mysterious Collapse of World Trade Center 7: Why the Final Official Report About 9/11 Is Unscientific and False\", published in 2009, examines the credibility of the official investigations into and hypotheses about the destruction of the third skyscraper, WTC 7, focusing on the final official report published in November 2008.\n\nIn September 2004, the interactive \"Complete 9/11 Timeline\" website by Paul Thompson, a collection of mainstream media reports presented chronologically, was made into the book, entitled \"The Terror Timeline\".\n\nFilms made by people associated with the 9/11 Truth movement include:\n\nThese documentaries present a range of alternative theories about how the attacks might have been carried out:\n\n\n\n"}

As of 2012 she is professor of science, technology and society at Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.\n\nAdam was a research fellow at Lancaster University, and a lecturer and senior lecturer in the Department of Computation at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. She was professor of information systems from 2003 to 2008, then professor of science, technology and society from 2008 to 2012 at the University of Salford, where she worked from 2000 until 2012, heading the Information Systems Institute in 2004–6 and then directing the Information Systems, Organisations and Society Research Centre. She has been professor of science, technology and society at Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield since 2012.\n\nAdam's research has primarily been within the area of Science and Technology Studies, including history and sociology of science and technology. Her predominant focus was the field of information systems. Her main contribution to research in gender and technology was a study of gender in relation to artificial intelligence (AI), in particular how feminist epistemology could be used to challenge the epistemology of AI and a study of feminist ethics and how it relates to computer ethics. Notable publications in this area include the \"Artificial Knowing: Gender and the Thinking Machine\" and \"Gender, Ethics and Information Technology\". The book \"Gender, Ethics and Information Technology\" explores the \"intersection of two areas; firstly gender and information and communication technologies and secondly, computer ethics.\" In 2012 she completed a three-year Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council funded research project on online privacy, in collaboration with researchers at Salford, Royal Holloway, University of London, and Cranfield University. She has evaluated the part that gender plays in ethics in on-line behaviour evaluating the gender divide in hacking, cyberstalking, and pornography to evaluate what gender differences exist in on-line experiences.\n\nSince 2010 Adam has researched the history and sociology of forensic sciences. Her 2015 book, \"A History of Forensic Science: British Beginnings in the Twentieth Century\", charts the history of forensic sciences in the UK, mainly England, considering the broad spectrum of factors that went into creating the discipline in Britain in the first part of the twentieth century. These influences were criminological, criminalistic, scientific, technological and even fictional. She argues that new interest in managing crime scenes arrived on British shores, from the Continent via British India and Egypt and was channeled into the ‘scientific aids’ movement of the 1930s which can be seen as Continental and Colonial criminalistics in British clothing. The book charts the strategies of the new forensic scientists to gain an authoritative voice in the courtroom and to forge a professional identity in the space between forensic medicine, scientific policing, and independent expert witnessing drawing on the moral voice of the forensic scientist alongside the cultural authority of the fictional scientific detective.\n\nTextiles are another long-standing interest. She states that \"there's nothing quite like making a physical artifact. The culture of sharing information about making, on-line, is fascinating.\" From 2012 to 2014, she was engaged in interdisciplinary research on the culture of mending clothes.\n\nAt the University of Salford, Adam taught cybercrime, digital divide, research methodology, and sociology of forensic sciences. Adam served as deputy chair of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 sub-panel on Communication, Cultural and Media Studies, Library and Information Management (UoA 36) and was a member of the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) 2008 sub-panel on Library and Information Management (UoA 37).\n\nBooks\n"}

The traditional etymology is from the verb \"aperire\", \"to open\", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to \"open\", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of άνοιξη (\"ánixi\") (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess Venus, her Veneralia being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month Aphrilis, from her equivalent Greek goddess name Aphrodite (\"Aphros\"), or from the Etruscan name \"Apru\". Jacob Grimm suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, \"Aper\" or \"Aprus\".\n\nApril was the second month of the earliest Roman calendar, before \"Ianuarius\" and \"Februarius\" were added by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the decemvirs about 450 BC, when it also was given 29 days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by Julius Caesar in the mid-40s BC, which produced the Julian calendar.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons called April \"ēastre-monaþ\". The Venerable Bede says in \"The Reckoning of Time\" that this month \"ēastre\" is the root of the word Easter. He further states that the month was named after a goddess \"Eostre\" whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by Einhard in his work, Vita Karoli Magni.\n\nSt George's day is the twenty-third of the month; and St Mark's Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.\n\nIn China the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April. In Finnish April is \"huhtikuu\", meaning \"slash-and-burn moon\", when gymnosperms for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.\n\nIn Slovene, the most established traditional name is \"mali traven\", meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the Škofja Loka manuscript.\n\nThe month Aprilis had 30 days; Numa Pompilius made it 29 days long; finally Julius Caesar’s calendar reform made it again 30 days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of Augustus Caesar in 8 BC.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, the festival of Cerealia was held for seven days from mid-to-late April, but exact dates are uncertain. Feriae Latinae was also held in April, with the date varying. Other ancient Roman observances include Veneralia (April 1), Megalesia (April 10–16), Fordicidia (April 15), Parilia (April 21), Vinalia Urbana, Robigalia, and Serapia were celebrated on (April 25). Floralia was held April 27 during the Republican era, or April 28 on the Julian calendar, and lasted until May 3. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe Lyrids meteor shower appears on April 16 – April 26 each year, with the peak generally occurring on April 22. Eta Aquariids meteor shower also appears in April. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The Pi Puppids appear on April 23, but only in years around the parent comet's perihelion date. The Virginids also shower at various dates in April.\n\nThe \"Days of April\" (\"journées d'avril\") is a name appropriated in French history to a series of insurrections at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of Louis Philippe in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the \"procès d'avril\".\n\n\n\"This list does not necessarily imply either official status nor general observance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1192", "title": "Artistic revolution", "text": "Artistic revolution\n\nThroughout history, forms of art have gone through periodic abrupt changes called artistic revolutions. Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways. See also cultural movements.\n\nThe role of fine art has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing.\n\nArtists who succeeded enough to portray visions that future generations could live to see, often had to navigate an often treacherous path between their own capacity to see and execute what lesser artists could not, while still appealing to powerful patrons who could finance their visions. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.\n\nNo art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does. It was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by Louix XIV in the 17th century that the likes of Poussin and Le Brun put France in the forefront of European art. Versailles found its stately mirror in the powerful idea of classicism – a painting style, enduring in later artists like Ingres, whose austerity and grandeur express the authority of a world where Jove is very much in his throne.\n\nExamples of revolutionary art in conjunction with cultural and political movements:\n\n\nHere is an example of an Artistic Revolution Pieces\n\nNot all artistic revolutions were political. Sometimes, science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists. The stylistic revolution known as Impressionism, by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow, is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid-19th century in which the style was born.\n\nEugene Chevreul, a French chemist hired as director of dyes at a French tapestry works, began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics. Chevreul realized It was the eye, and not the dye, that had the greatest influence on color, and from this, he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast: that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed, each imposing its own complementary color on the other. The French painter Eugène Delacroix, who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones, embraced Chevreul's book, \"The Law of Contrast of Color (1839) with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other, and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum. Inspired by Chevreul’s 1839 treatise, Delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him. It was Chevreul who led the Impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewer’s eye to combine them optically.\n\nThey were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself. Since the Renaissance, painters had to grind pigment, add oil and thus create their own paints; these time-consuming paints also quickly dried out, making studio painting a necessity for large works, and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out. in 1841, a little-known American painter named John G. Rand invented a simple improvement without which the Impressionist movement could not have occurred: the small, flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored. Oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist and usable -- and quite portable. For the first time since the Renaissance, painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried.\n\nPaints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world, to directly observe the play of color and natural light, in shadow and movement, to paint in the moment. Selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments - chrome yellow, cadmium blue - invented by 19th century industrial chemists. The tubes freed the Impressionists to paint quickly, and across an entire canvas, rather than carefully delineated single-color sections at a time; in short, to sketch directly in oil - racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of \"impressionists\" - since such speedy, bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions, not finished paintings, which were to have no visible brush marks at all, seamless under layers of varnish.\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir said, “Without colors in tubes, there would be no Cézanne, no Monet, no Pissarro, and no Impressionism.”\n\nFinally, the careful, hyper-realistic techniques of French neo-classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid-1850s. It was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention, particularly by the French inventor Daguerre, made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the Paris diorama with large-scale historical paintings. The neo-classical subject matter, limited by Academic tradition to Greek and Roman legends, historical battles and Biblical stories, seemed oppressively cliched and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera - daily life, candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things, Paris itself, rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light - not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past events. Early photographs influenced Impressionist style by its use of asymmetry, cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion, as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography.\n\nTheir initial break with realism into an exploration of light, color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the Abstract Expressionists who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape, color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the second world war. At first thought of as primitive, inept works - as in \"my four year old could do that\"—these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the 1940s and 50's, expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used, or even understood. Jackson Pollock who pioneered splatter painting, dispensing with a paint brush altogether, soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in Life Magazine.\n\nIn fact, in a deliberate, secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones, abstract expressionists like Pollack, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, while seemingly difficult, pathbreaking artists, were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the C.I.A. in a Cold War policy begun in 1947 to prove that the United States could foster more artistic freedom than the Soviet bloc. \"It was recognized that Abstract Expressionism was the kind of art that made Socialist Realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was, \" said former C.I.A. case worker Donald Jameson, who finally broke the silence on this program in 1995. Ironically, the covert C.I.A. support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a European tour of these works during the Truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative McCarthy-era America, with Truman famously remarking, \"If that's art, I'm a Hottentot.\" Thus the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using C.I.A. funds, not their own, to sponsor traveling exhibitions of American abstract expressionists all over the world, publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit Abstract Expressionist works in major American and British museums. Thomas Braden, in charge of these cultural programs for the C.I.A.. in the early years of the Cold War, had formerly been executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art, America's leading institution for 20th Century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed, though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found out.\n\nKey dates: 15000 BCE / 400 BCE-200CE / 350 CE-450CE\nAncient - There are few remaining examples with early art often favouring drawing over colour. Work has been found recently in tombs, Egyptian frescoes, pottery and metalwork.\nClassical - Relating to or from ancient Roman or Greek architecture and art. Mainly concerned with geometry and symmetry rather than individual expression.\nByzantine - A religious art characterised by large domes, rounded arches and mosaics from the eastern Roman Empire in the 4th Century.\n\nKey dates: 400CE\nMedieval - A highly religious art beginning in the 5th Century in Western Europe. It was characterised by iconographic paintings illustrating scenes from the bible.\nGothic - This style prevailed between the 12th century and the 16th century in Europe. Mainly an architectural movement, Gothic was characterised by its detailed ornamentation most noticeably the pointed archways and elaborate rib vaulting.\nFirst developed in France, Gothic was intended as a solution to the inadequacies of Romanesque architecture. It allowed for cathedrals to be built with thinner walls and it became possible to introduce stained glass windows instead of traditional mosaic decorations. Some of the finest examples of the style include the cathedrals of Chartres, Reims and Amiens. The term was also used to describe sculpture and painting that demonstrated a greater degree of naturalism.\n\nKey dates: 14th century\nThis movement began in Italy in the 14th century and the term, literally meaning rebirth, describes the revival of interest in the artistic achievements of the Classical world. Initially in a literary revival Renaissance was determined to move away from the religion-dominated Middle Ages and to turn its attention to the plight of the individual man in society. It was a time when individual expression and worldly experience became two of the main themes of Renaissance art. The movement owed a lot to the increasing sophistication of society, characterised by political stability, economic growth and cosmopolitanism. Education blossomed at this time, with libraries and academies allowing more thorough research to be conducted into the culture of the antique world. In addition, the arts benefited from the patronage of such influential groups as the Medici family of Florence, the Sforza family of Milan and Popes Julius II and Leo X. The works of Petrarch first displayed the new interest in the intellectual values of the Classical world in the early 14th century and the romance of this era as rediscovered in the Renaissance period can be seen expressed by Boccaccio. Leonardo da Vinci was the archetypal Renaissance man representing the humanistic values of the period in his art, science and writing. Michelangelo and Raphael were also vital figures in this movement, producing works regarded for centuries as embodying the classical notion of perfection. Renaissance architects included Alberti, Brunelleschi and Bramante. Many of these artists came from Florence and it remained an important centre for the Renaissance into the 16th century eventually to be overtaken by Rome and Venice. Some of the ideas of the Italian Renaissance did spread to other parts of Europe, for example to the German artist Albrecht Dürer of the 'Northern Renaissance'. But by the 16th century Mannerism had overtaken the Renaissance and it was this style that caught on in Europe. \nRepresentative artists:\nLeonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Filippo Brunelleschi, Raphael da Urbino, Titian, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Donatello Bardi.\n\nKey dates: 1520-1600\nArtists of the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance developed their characteristic styles from the observation of nature and the formulation of a pictorial science. When Mannerism matured after 1520(The year Raphael died), all the representational problems had been solved. A body of knowledge was there to be learned. Instead of nature as their teacher, Mannerist artists took art. While Renaissance artists sought nature to find their style, the Mannerists looked first for a style and found a manner. In Mannerist paintings, compositions can have no focal point, space can be ambiguous, figures can be characterized by an athletic bending and twisting with distortions, exaggerations, an elastic elongation of the limbs, bizarre posturing on one hand, graceful posturing on the other hand, and a rendering of the heads as uniformly small and oval. The composition is jammed by clashing colors, which is unlike what we've seen in the balanced, natural, and dramatic colors of the High Renaissance. Mannerist artwork seeks instability and restlessness. There is also a fondness for allegories that have lascivious undertones. \nRepresentative artists:\nAndrea del Sarto, Jacopo da Pontormo, Correggio\n\nKey dates: 17th century\nBaroque Art emerged in Europe around 1600, as a reaction against the intricate and formulaic Mannerist style which dominated the Late Renaissance. Baroque Art is less complex, more realistic and more emotionally affecting than Mannerism.\nThis movement was encouraged by the Catholic Church, the most important patron of the arts at that time, as a return to tradition and spirituality.\nOne of the great periods of art history, Baroque Art was developed by Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Gianlorenzo Bernini, among others. This was also the age of Rubens, Rembrandt, Velázquez, and Vermeer.\nIn the 18th century, Baroque Art was replaced by the more elegant and elaborate Rococo style.\nRepresentative artists:\nCaravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Gianlorenzo Bernini, Rubens, Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin\n\nKey dates: 18th century\nThroughout the 18th century in France, a new wealthy and influential middle-class was beginning to rise, even though the royalty and nobility continued to be patrons of the arts. Upon the death of Louis XIV and the abandonment of Versailles, the Paris high society became the purveyors of style. This style, primarily used in interior decoration, came to be called Rococo. The term Rococo was derived from the French word \"rocaille\", which means pebbles and refers to the stones and shells used to decorate the interiors of caves. Therefore, shell forms became the principal motif in Rococo. The society women competed for the best and most elaborate decorations for their houses. Hence the Rococo style was highly dominated by the feminine taste and influence.\nFrançois Boucher was the 18th century painter and engraver whose works are regarded as the perfect expression of French taste in the Rococo period. Trained by his father who was a lace designer, Boucher won fame with his sensuous and light-hearted mythological paintings and landscapes. He executed important works for both the Queen of France and Mme. de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, who was considered the most powerful woman in France at the time. Boucher was Mme. de Pompadour's favorite artist and was commissioned by her for numerous paintings and decorations. Boucher also became the principal designer for the royal porcelain factory and the director of the Gobelins tapestry factory. The Vulcan Presenting Venus with Arms for Aeneas is a template for a tapestry made by this factory. \nCharacterized by elegant and refined yet playful subject matters, Boucher's style became the epitome of the court of Louis XV. His style consisted of delicate colors and gentle forms painted within a frivolous subject matter. His works typically utilized delightful and decorative designs to illustrate graceful stories with Arcadian shepherds, goddesses and cupids playing against a pink and blue sky. These works mirrored the frolicsome, artificial and ornamented decadence of the French aristocracy of the time.\nThe Rococo is sometimes considered a final phase of the Baroque period.\nRepresentative artists:\nFrançois Boucher, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Angelica Kauffman, Giovanni Antonio Canaletto, Velázquez Vermeer\n\nKey dates: 1750-1880\nA nineteenth-century French art style and movement that originated as a reaction to the Baroque. It sought to revive the ideals of ancient Greek and Roman art. Neoclassic artists used classical forms to express their ideas about courage, sacrifice, and love of country. David and Canova are examples of neo-classicists.\nRepresentative artists:\nJacques-Louis David, Sir Henry Raeburn, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Thomas Gainsborough, Antonio Canova, Arnold Bocklin\n\nKey dates: 1800-1880\nRomanticism was basically a reaction against Neoclassicism, it is a deeply felt style which is individualistic, beautiful, exotic, and emotionally wrought.\nAlthough Romanticism and Neoclassicism were philosophically opposed, they were the dominant European styles for generations, and many artists were affected to a greater or lesser degree by both. Artists might work in both styles at different times or even mix the styles, creating an intellectually Romantic work using a Neoclassical visual style, for example.\nGreat artists closely associated with Romanticism include J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, John Constable, and William Blake.\nIn the United States, the leading Romantic movement was the Hudson River School of dramatic landscape painting.\nObvious successors of Romanticism include the Pre-Raphaelite movement and the Symbolists. But Impressionism, and through it almost all of 20th-century art, is also firmly rooted in the Romantic tradition. \nRepresentative artists:\nGeorge Stubbs, William Blake, John Martin, Francisco Goya, Sir Thomas Lawrence, John Constable, Eugène Delacroix, Sir Edwin landseer, Caspar David Friedrich, JMW Turner\n"}

Bad Homburg is part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area. The town's formal name is \"Bad Homburg vor der Höhe\" (translated as \"Bad Homburg in front of the height\") to distinguish it from other places of the same name, abbreviated as \"Bad Homburg v. d. Höhe\". It is best known for its medically used mineral waters and spa (hence the prefix \"Bad\", \"bath\"), and for its casino.\n\nToday, Bad Homburg is again one of the wealthiest towns in Germany (with the Hochtaunuskreis and the Landkreis Starnberg regularly competing for the title of the wealthiest district in Germany). , the town's marketing slogan is \"Champagnerluft und Tradition\" (Champagne air and tradition).\n\nLocal tradition holds that Bad Homburg's documented history began with the mention of the \"Villa Tidenheim\" in the Lorsch codex, connected with the year 782. This \"Villa Tidenheim\" was equated with the Old Town, called \"Dietigheim\". This connection is also reflected in street names. Local historian, Rüdiger Kurth, doubted these traditional stories based on his study of written sources and local factors. In 2002 Kurth initiated archaeological digs by the University of Frankfurt under the leadership of Professor Joachim Henning. The excavations showed that there was no evidence of settlement between the beginning of the Christian Era and the 13th century. It appears that the historical record which makes mention of Wortwin (or Ortwin) von Hohenberch—as Homburg's founder—as a documentary witness in Eberbach in about 1180 is the first concrete evidence of the town's existence.\n\nAs early as 1962, in a dig under the \"Hirschgangflügel\" (\"Hart Stalking Wing\") at Bad Homburg's \"Schloss\" (stately home), two burnt layers were discovered, which the man conducting the dig, Günther Binding, took as evidence of two former castles having been built on the site one after the other, but each having burnt down later.\n\nFurther digs by the University of Frankfurt at Bad Homburg's \"Schloss\" in April 2006, once again initiated by Kurth and under Professor Henning's leadership, led to the discovery that it was actually only one burnt layer from a half-timbered building—possibly a castle with towers—which from ceramic finds could be dated to the 12th or 13th century. Most likely this building stood in connection with Wortwin's \"castle\". Quite possibly, though, a further cultural layer from an even earlier time lies waiting to be discovered underneath these remains. Investigations using methods from natural science (carbon-14 dating and micromorphological analysis) will show whether the dating can be made more precise.\n\nHomberg acquired market rights about 1330, but the document granting these rights is said to have been lost.\n\nThe town's name, \"Homburg\", comes from the \"Hohenberg\" Castle. The postfix \"vor der Höhe\" was probably first recorded in a document in 1399.\n\nThe Hessen-Homburg noble family of landgraves was founded with Friedrich I of Hessen-Homburg. Friedrich II (1680–1708) attained fame as Prince of Homburg. In 1866, as a result of the Austro-Prussian War, Homburg became Prussian territory.\n\nWith the coming of the spa industry in the mid-19th century, which profited greatly from the casino built in town, the town changed into an internationally famous spa town. Bad Homburg was particularly favoured by Russian nobility for its baths.\n\nThe spa industry began with the discovery of the \"Elisabethenbrunnen\" (\"Brunnen\" is German for \"well\") in 1834 (although the designation \"Bad\" was not conferred until 1912). The first spa building and the first casino in Homburg were built in 1841–1842 by the brothers François (1806–1877) and Louis Blanc (1806–1852), who later took over the Monte Carlo Casino, which is why the Homburg Casino is sometimes called the \"Mother of Monte Carlo\". In 1860, the town was connected with Frankfurt by a railway line, the \"Homburger Bahn\".\n\nIn 1888, Bad Homburg became known throughout the German Empire because Kaiser Wilhelm II declared Bad Homburg's \"Schloss\" an Imperial summer residence, and later financed the building of the Church of the Redeemer (Erlöserkirche) close by. His mother, too, Empress Friedrich, the old emperor's widow—and Queen Victoria's eldest daughter—lived there for several years. Edward VII was also often a guest. It was he who introduced the Homburg hat and permanent turn-up trousers. He also underwent fasting cures at Homburg 32 times.\n\nThe \"Bad Homburger Golf Club 1899 e. V.\" in the \"Röderweisen\" in Dornholzhausen—nowadays part of Bad Homburg—is Germany's oldest golf club. It had its beginnings in the Bad Homburg Spa Park (\"Kurpark\"), where the old clubhouse and even playable parts of the old golf course may still be found.\n\nNot far away stands the Russian Chapel—actually more properly called All Hallows' Church—an Eastern Orthodox church whose first stone was laid in the Russian Imperial couple's presence on 16 October 1896, although they did not attend when it was consecrated almost three years later.\n\nKing Chulalongkorn of Siam (Thailand) sent a Thai garden pavilion in gratitude for a successful cure. It was erected in 1914.\n\nHorex was a well known German motorcycle brand of the \"Horex—Fahrzeugbau AG\", founded in 1923 in Bad Homburg by Fritz Kleemann.\n\nIn 1335, permission was given by Emperor Louis IV to Gottfried von Eppstein to settle 10 Jews in each of the localities of Eppstein, Homburg, and Steinheim; it is uncertain, however, whether any Jews settled in Homburg at that time. Evidence for the existence of a permanent Jewish settlement in Homburg is found only at the beginning of the 16th century. Up to 1600 it consisted of 2 or 3 families, and by 1632 these had increased to 16. The first Jewish cemetery was purchased in the 17th century. The community continued to grow so rapidly that in 1703 the landgrave Frederick II of Hesse decided on the construction of a special Judengasse. A synagogue, built in 1731, was replaced by a new one in 1867. The Jewish community of Homburg was originally under the jurisdiction of the rabbinate of Friedberg but began to appoint its own rabbis in the 19th century.\n\nA Hebrew printing house was run in Homburg by Seligmann ben Hirz Reis in 1710 until 1713 when he moved to Offenbach am Main. Among other items, he published Jacob ibn Ḥabib's \"Ein Ya'akov\" (1712). Hebrew printing was resumed there in 1724 by Samson ben Salman Hanau but lack of capital limited his output. The press was acquired in 1736 by Aaron ben Ẓevi Dessau whose publications included the \"Shulhan Arukh (Ḥoshen Mishpat)\" with commentary (1742). The press was sold in 1748 and transferred in 1749 to Roedelheim. At the beginning of the 20th century, the spa of Homburg became a meeting place of Russian-Jewish intellectuals. The Jewish population numbered 604 (7.14% of the total population) in 1865, declining to 379 in 1910 (2.64%), and 300 in 1933. Of the 74 Jews who remained on 17 May 1939, 42 were deported in 1942/1943.\n\nWhile the spa business experienced a long-term decline in the wake of the two world wars, the town gained importance by becoming the site for headquarters of various authorities and administrative bodies. By autumn 1946, the military government had already ordered the founding of bizonal authorities. Bad Homburg was chosen as the seat of the financial administrative centre. On 23 July 1947, the Bizone Economic Council instituted the \"Special Money and Credit Centre\" here in preparation for currency reform. The centre was headed by Ludwig Erhard. After the Federal Republic of Germany—West Germany—was founded with its capital in Bonn, the Federal Debt Administration (\"Bundesschuldenverwaltung\"), the Office for Security Adjustment (\"Amt für Wertpapierbereinigung\") and the Federal Equalization Office (\"Bundesausgleichsamt\") stayed in Bad Homburg.\n\nIn the 20th century, Bad Homburg became a favourite residential area among the upper classes. On 30 November 1989, one of its members, Alfred Herrhausen, the head of the Deutsche Bank, was killed and his driver was injured by a car bomb in Bad Homburg. It was alleged that this was an attack by the Red Army Faction, though this has never been conclusively proven.\n\n\nBad Homburg's civic coat of arms was granted in 1903 but is said to date from the 15th century on the basis of seals known from that time, although they show a saltire rather than the two adzes seen today (the saltire might be two unclear adzes). The reason for the adzes in the arms is not known; it is possibly dialectal canting. The colours, with silver adzes in a blue field, have been in use at least since 1621.\n\n\n\n\n\nBad Homburg is twinned with:\n\n"}

His main scholarly legacy lies within the field of Medieval Anglo-Saxon numismatics, where he produced pioneering catalogues and studies. Much of this work was indirectly due to agricultural reforms in Sweden that led to Viking Period silver coin hoards surfacing at a rate never seen before or after Hildebrand's day; the 1864 edition of Hildebrand's \"Anglo-Saxon coins in the Swedish Royal Coin Cabinet\" drew on the evidence of 64 Swedish hoards alongside other European finds to establish the basic chronology of the late Anglo-Saxon coinage, much of which has remained valid after more than a century of subsequent research.\n\nHildebrand was the father of archaeologist Hans Hildebrand and teacher both to him and to archaeologist Oscar Montelius.\n"}

In the 1920s, an international beauty culture was forged, and society increasingly focused on novelty and change. Fashion trends influenced theater, films, literature, and art.\n\nWomen also found a new need to wear more make-up, as a skewed postwar sex ratio created a new emphasis on sexual beauty. Additionally, as women began to enter the professional world, publications such as the French \"Beauty Industry\" encouraged women to wear makeup to look their best while competing with men for employment.\n\nLipstick became widely popular after Maurice Levy's 1915 invention of the metal lipstick container. It was available in salve, liquid, and stick forms, and long-lasting, indelible stains were the most popular. Lip pomade, also called lip gloss, was later invented by Max Factor, Sr. in an effort to provide a glamorous appearance to actress' lips on film. Soon after, 'natural' lip gloss was created, which used bromo acid to create a red effect as it reacted with the wearer's skin. Finally, flavored lipstick was also popular, with the most popular variety being cherry.\n\nIn 1916, Max Factor began selling eye shadow and eyebrow pencils. This was the first time such products were available outside of the movie industry. Max continued to be a driving force behind make-up until his death in 1938. In 1991, his company became a part of the Procter & Gamble family.\n\nIn the 1920s, different products were also developed that showed the decade's preoccupation with shaping the mouth. Metal lip tracers, made in various sizes to satisfy the wishes of the wearer, were developed to ensure flawless lipstick application. Helena Rubinstein created a product called \"Cupid's Bow,\" that billed itself as a \"self-shaping lipstick that forms a perfect cupid's bow as you apply it.\" The development of the mirrored lipstick container in the 1920s also points to the importance of shaping the lips through the application of lipstick.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the messy elixir blushes of past years were replaced by creams, powders, liquids, and rouge papers. Powder blushes became more popular after the invention of spill-proof containers and the compact.\n\nIndelible blushes, like indelible lipsticks, were popular.\n\nIn the early 1920s many women fulfilled their desire for darker fuller lashes by resorting to the use of common household products. Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) was mixed with soot or coal. The resulting solution was a dark gel that was then applied to the lashes with a fine brush.\n\nDuring the middle of the decade, mascara was available in cake, tube, wax, and liquid form and applied with a brush. Surprisingly enough, there were even waterproof formulations available.\n\nThe various forms of brush-on mascara served to darken the lashes but did not provide the sculpting abilities of modern-day mascara wands. For this, ladies used eyelash curlers such as the then popular Kurlash.\n\nDe Castelbajac, Kate. \"The Face of the Century: 100 Years of Makeup and Style.\" Rizzoli International Publications (1995), .\n"}

Before World War II, he joined to the Young Communist League of Yugoslavia (SKOJ). During the war, he joined Yugoslav Partisans in 1942 as political commesar in Slavonian partisan units. In the same year, he joined Communist Party of Yugoslavia. In 1955 he graduated from the University of Belgrade's Law School and from 1945 until 1960 he taught military history at Military Academy in Belgrade. After he left the army, he started to work as a journalist, but soon he was employed in a trade union and in 1965 he was named member of the Trade Union Presidency of Yugoslavia as a representative of Croatia. As he worked with in unions under self-management, Bilandžić continued his education. In 1965 he gained PhD from the University of Zagreb Faculty of Economics. In 1967, after Franjo Tuđman has been arrested because of undesirable political activity, Bilandžić succeeded him as director of the Institute for History of the Workers' Movement.

He became regular member of HAZU (earlier JAZU) in 1991.\n\nBilandžić was an enemy of centralization of Yugoslavia after Josip Broz Tito died in 1980. Since he denied validity of Yugoslav nationality during the 1981 census, he was highly criticized by Belgrade as separatist and \"Ustaše\". Bilandžić stated that category of \"Yugoslav\" led to disappearance more than 30,000 Croats in Vojvodina. He feared that \"Yugoslav\" category would continue to grow which would call into question the entire basis of Yugoslav cultural and political policies, which were predicated on a person having a single national identification. Specifically, a loss of Croats would mean fewer people to support Croat politicians and diminution of their power base within the multinational state.\n\nWith democratic elections in Croatia in 1991, Bilandžić joined the list of Social Democratic Party of Croatia, but the election results were devastating. Since he was a good friend of Tuđman, Tuđman named him Croatian representative in Belgrade in 1991. His friendship with Tuđman was very complex, since Tuđman often criticized him, even calling him \"a monster\" on the TV after Operation Storm in 1995.\n\nHis main focus in History of former Yugoslavia and position of Croats in it. Besides writing books, he participated in writing articles for various magazines and newspapers. His greatest works are History of SFRY (1978) and Croatian Modern History (1999). Since History of SFRY was highly under political censorship, in Croatian Modern History Bilandžić used his previous book as a source, but gave different comments on the same events.\n\nIn 2004, in a popular Croatian talk show, \"Nedjeljom u 2\", Bilandžić stated that Croatia had more sovereignty in the SFR Yugoslavia than it would have in the European Union.\n\nBilandžić was member of the Steering Committee of the Croatian Mainstreem of Emigrants, member of the Commission of the Presidency of the Socialist Republic of Croatia for Pardon and member of the Presidency of the SR Croatia.\n\nHe was decorated with Order of Danica Hrvatska with face of Ruđer Bošković for his contribution to science, and Annual Award for Science, which he gained for his work Croatian Modern History (Zagreb, 1999).

They were often indiscreet, and on occasion \"keys\" would circulate that identified the real people on which the principal characters were based. Their emphasis on the relations of the sexes and on marital relationships presaged later development in the novel.\n\nTheodore Hook was a major writer of fashionable novels, and Henry Colburn was a major publisher. Colburn particularly advertised fashionable novels as providing insight into aristocratic life by insiders. Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Benjamin Disraeli and Catherine Gore were other very popular writers of the genre. Many were advertised as being written by aristocrats, for aristocrats.\n\nAs more women wrote the genre, it became increasingly moralized: \"middle-class morality became central, and the novels detailed the demise of the aristocracy, though the characteristically Byronic heroes of the genre remained.\" The most popular authors of silver fork novels were women, including Lady Blessington, Catherine Gore and Lady Bury.\n\nWilliam Hazlitt coined the term \"silver fork\" in an article on “The Dandy School” in 1827. He characterized them as having \"under-bred tone\" because while they purported to tell the lives of aristocrats, they were commonly written by the middle-class. Thomas Carlyle wrote \"Sartor Resartus\" in critique of their minute detailing of clothing, and William Makepeace Thackeray satirized them in \"Vanity Fair\" and \"Pendennis\".\n\nIn Donna Leon's fourth Commissario Guido Brunetti novel, \"Death and Judgment\", English professor Paola Brunetti describes silver fork novels as \"books written in the eighteenth century, when all that money poured into England from the colonies, and the fat wives of Yorkshire weavers had to be taught which fork to use.\"\n\n\n"}

The first geocoins were developed by Jon Stanley (aka moun10bike) as a signature item to be placed in caches. \n\nMany of these are made to be trackable on various websites to be able to show the movement around the world and visitors to be able to leave comments when they find the coin. Each coin has a unique tracking ID, which can also be used when logging it to a designated website. \n\nA geocoin typically has a diameter of to and a thickness between and . Coins with the size of are called microcoins, because they fit into microcaches (e.g. film canister). The smallest geocoins with a diameter of are called nanocoins, and have been sold since 2009. If the diameter is larger than the geocoin is called macrocoin, and contains the saying of \"that's not a coin it's an anchor\".\n\nPersonal geocoins are a personal signature item that normally bears the geocacher's handle and personal design. For example, it was Jon Stanley's (aka moun10bike) original manufacture of a coin that started the hobby in the geocaching game. It has a stylized mountain bike and his caching handle, and on the back the geocaching logo.\n\nGeocoins are often minted by caching organizations and companies. Though not specifically a personal signature item they are a form of signature item for the organization that developed them. However, most are custom-made for geocachers, usually in batches of 100 pieces or less.\n\nReviewer/Moderator/Lackey Coins are another form of signature items over the years these have their own following. Many of them have taken the time to create their own signature item.\n\nIn the first few years the number of coins that were a signature item for a geocaching group, or individuals far outnumbered the coins that were made to sell. However now they tend to be smaller percentage as the industry has a number of coins manufacturers that develop coins for events, holidays, or special coins. The cost to make a personal coin is fairly high.\n\nWhen a cache listed at geocaching.com contains a geocoin, an icon (often unique to the type of the coin) is shown on the cache page's \"Inventory\" section. This icon will also appear in the inventory of any cacher holding one as well as in each cacher's historical trackable item listing. Icons will also remain in the inventory of cachers who log the 'discovery' of a geocoin's number without physically removing it from a cache. \"Icon collecting\" – the act of having these icons listed in one's trackables listing – is an associated hobby. Many people bring geocoins with unique icons to geocaching events so that others may see the coins and use the tracking number to collect the icons online, and it is not uncommon for collectors to activate some or all of the coins in their collections in order to have a matching online collection of icons associated with their geocaching.com accounts.\n\nOther websites for trackable coins have included the 2002Canadian geocoin, Utah geocoin, Oregon State coin, and sigitem.com.\n\nFree tracking service for coins and other items is available from Geokrety, with full service for geocaching sites such as opencaching.us, and partial service for other geocaching sites. An owner of geocoins can also set up his own website to monitor these moving mementos.\n\nIt is not uncommon for activated, released geocoins to go missing, whether because a cacher is unfamiliar with the logging and tracking process or due to outright theft. Some geocoin owners will purposefully attempt to destroy the resale value of the coin by drilling and tagging it with an extra tag, marker, or other item that is intended to underscore the fact that the geocoin is meant to travel, not to be kept. Another somewhat controversial anti-theft measure is to create a copy of the geocoin, releasing the copy and keeping the original.\n\nIn 2012, a geocoin helped authorities return stolen items to a geocaching enthusiast in Seattle, who marked the coins as missing online. The goods were found in a storage unit during a raid and the geocoins became instrumental in connecting the burglars to their crime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The 11th century Persian writer Al-Biruni, who described the Guptas as \"wicked\", incorrectly stated that the Gupta era marked the end of the Gupta dynasty. He dated the beginning of the Gupta era to the year 241 of the Shaka era, that is, 318–319 CE. Al-Biruni's claim later led to debates about the era's origin among the 19th century historians.\n\nJohn Faithfull Fleet analysed the Gupta inscriptions, and realised that they were dated to years of a particular calendar era. He believed that the era was founded by king Jayadeva of the Lichchhavi dynasty (relatives of the Guptas), and was later adopted by the Guptas.\n\nLater discoveries and analysis indicate that the era was actually founded by the Guptas, and was known after them. For example:\n\n\nGeorg Bühler concluded that the Gupta era was started by Chandragupta I in 318–319 CE, to mark his coronation. This is the most prevalant theory about the era's origin now. However, this cannot be said with certainty, and the era may have been started by his predecessors or his son Samudragupta as well. Some other theories trace the origin of the era to 3rd century CE or earlier, but this view is now discredited: the 7th century inscription of Shashanka is dated to the 300th year of the Gupta era, and proves that the Gupta era started in the 4th century.\n\nThe Gupta era was used in northern India, western India and parts of eastern India until the end of the Gupta dynasty in the 6th century CE.\n\nApart from the Gupta rulers, the Gupta era was also used by their vassals and successors, such as:\n\n\nAccording to the calculations of John Faithfull Fleet, the Gupta era began on the first day of the shukla paksha (bright fortnight) of the Chaitra month.

For example, the Julian day number for the day starting at 12:00 UT on January 1, 2000, was 2 451 545.\n\nThe Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number plus the fraction of a day since the preceding noon in Universal Time. Julian dates are expressed as a Julian day number with a decimal fraction added. For example, the Julian Date for 00:30:00.0 UT January 1, 2013, is 2 456 293.520 833.\n\nThe Julian Period is a chronological interval of 7980 years; year 1 of the Julian Period was 4713 BC. It has been used by historians since its introduction in 1583 to convert between different calendars. The Julian calendar year 2018 is year 6731 of the current Julian Period. The next Julian Period begins in the year AD 3268.\n\nThe term \"Julian date\" may also refer, outside of astronomy, to the day-of-year number (more properly, the ordinal date) in the Gregorian calendar, especially in computer programming, the military and the food industry, or it may refer to dates in the Julian calendar. For example, if a given \"Julian date\" is \"October 5, 1582\", this means that date in the Julian calendar (which was October 15, 1582, in the Gregorian calendar—the date it was first established). Without an astronomical or historical context, a \"Julian date\" given as \"36\" most likely means the 36th day of a given Gregorian year, namely February 5. Other possible meanings of a \"Julian date\" of \"36\" include an astronomical Julian Day Number, or the year AD 36 in the Julian calendar, or a duration of 36 astronomical Julian years). This is why the terms \"ordinal date\" or \"day-of-year\" are preferred. In contexts where a \"Julian date\" means simply an ordinal date, calendars of a Gregorian year with formatting for ordinal dates are often called \"Julian calendars\", but this could also mean that the calendars are of years in the Julian calendar system.\n\nHistorical Julian dates were recorded relative to GMT or Ephemeris Time, but the International Astronomical Union now recommends that Julian dates be specified in Terrestrial Time, and that when necessary to specify Julian dates using a different time scale, that the time scale used be indicated when required, such as JD(UT1). The fraction of the day is found by converting the number of hours, minutes, and seconds after noon into the equivalent decimal fraction. Time intervals calculated from differences of Julian Dates specified in non-uniform time scales, such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), may need to be corrected for changes in time scales (e.g. leap seconds).\n\nBecause the starting point or reference epoch is so long ago, numbers in the Julian day can be quite large and cumbersome. A more recent starting point is sometimes used, for instance by dropping the leading digits, in order to fit into limited computer memory with an adequate amount of precision. In the following table, times are given in 24-hour notation.\n\nIn the table below, \"Epoch\" refers to the point in time used to set the origin (usually zero, but (1) where explicitly indicated) of the alternative convention being discussed in that row. The date given is a Gregorian calendar date if it is October 15, 1582, or later, but a Julian calendar date if it is earlier. JD stands for Julian Date. 0h is 00:00 midnight, 12h is 12:00 noon, UT unless otherwise specified. Current value is as of and may be cached. [ (update)]\n\n\nThe Heliocentric Julian Day (HJD) is the same as the Julian day, but adjusted to the frame of reference of the Sun, and thus can differ from the Julian day by as much as 8.3 minutes (498 seconds), that being the time it takes the Sun's light to reach Earth.\n\nTo illustrate the ambiguity that could arise, consider the two separate astronomical measurements of an astronomical object from the earth: Assume that three objects—the Earth, the Sun, and the astronomical object targeted, that is whose distance is to be measured—happen to be in a straight line for both measures. However, for the first measurement, the Earth is between the Sun and the targeted object, and for the second, the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun from that object. Then, the two measurements would differ by about 1000 light-seconds: For the first measurement, the Earth is roughly 500 light seconds closer to the target than the Sun, and roughly 500 light seconds further from the target astronomical object than the Sun for the second measure.\n\nAn error of about 1000 light-seconds is over 1% of a light-day, which can be a significant error when measuring temporal phenomena for short period astronomical objects over long time intervals. To clarify this issue, the ordinary Julian day is sometimes referred to as the Geocentric Julian Day (GJD) in order to distinguish it from HJD.\n\nThe \"Julian day number\" is based on the \"Julian Period\" proposed by Joseph Scaliger, a classical scholar, in 1583, at the time of the Gregorian calendar reform, as it is the least common multiple of three calendar cycles used with the Julian calendar:\n\nIts epoch falls at the last time when all three cycles (if they are continued backward far enough) were in their first year together — Scaliger chose this because it preceded all historical dates. Years of the Julian Period are counted from this year, 4713 BC, which was chosen to be before any historical record.\n\nSince it is now certain that every possible combination of the three cyclic numbers finds its place in the Julian Period, it is evident that the first year of the Christian era, which was the 10th year of a Solar Cycle, the 2nd of a Lunar Cycle, and the 4th of a Cycle of Indiction, finds its place within this artificial era, and must answer to that particular year of the period which is characterized by the same cyclic numbers. Hence, to refer the Christian era to the Julian Period is the same thing as to find out what year of that period it is which, when divided by 28 will leave a remainder 10, divided by 19 will leave a remainder 2, and divided by 15 will leave a remainder 4. The solution of this problem belongs to the higher mathematics, by which it is found that the year required is the 4714th of the period in question. Hence Jul. Per. 4714=A.D.1, and consequently Julian Period 4713=B.C.1.\n\nIn point of fact, finding the year is a very straightforward arithmetical procedure. See \"Calculation\" below.\n\nAlthough many references say that the \"Julian\" in \"Julian Period\" refers to Scaliger's father, Julius Scaliger, in the introduction to Book V of his ' (\"Work on the Emendation of Time\") he states, \"'\", which translates more or less as \"We have called it Julian merely because it is accommodated to the Julian year.\" Thus \"Julian\" refers to Julius Caesar, who introduced the Julian calendar in 46 BC.\n\nOriginally the Julian Period was used only to count years, and the Julian calendar was used to express historical dates within years. In his book \"Outlines of Astronomy\", first published in 1849, the astronomer John Herschel added the counting of days elapsed from the beginning of the Julian Period:\n\nThe period thus arising of 7980 Julian years, is called the Julian period, and it has been found so useful, that the most competent authorities have not hesitated to declare that, through its employment, light and order were first introduced into chronology. We owe its invention or revival to Joseph Scaliger, who is said to have received it from the Greeks of Constantinople. The first year of the current Julian period, or that of which the number in each of the three subordinate cycles is 1, was the year 4713 BC, and the noon of the 1st of January of that year, for the meridian of Alexandria, is the chronological epoch, to which all historical eras are most readily and intelligibly referred, by computing the number of integer days intervening between that epoch and the noon (for Alexandria) of the day, which is reckoned to be the first of the particular era in question. The meridian of Alexandria is chosen as that to which Ptolemy refers the commencement of the era of Nabonassar, the basis of all his calculations.\n\nAstronomers adopted Herschel's \"days of the Julian period\" in the late nineteenth century, but used the meridian of Greenwich instead of Alexandria, after the former was adopted as the Prime Meridian after the International Meridian Conference in Washington in 1884. This has now become the standard system of Julian days numbers.\n\nThe French mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace first expressed the time of day as a decimal fraction added to calendar dates in his book, \"\", in 1799. Other astronomers added fractions of the day to the Julian day number to create Julian Dates, which are typically used by astronomers to date astronomical observations, thus eliminating the complications resulting from using standard calendar periods like eras, years, or months. They were first introduced into variable star work by Edward Charles Pickering, of the Harvard College Observatory, in 1890.\n\nJulian days begin at noon because when Herschel recommended them, the astronomical day began at noon. The astronomical day had begun at noon ever since Ptolemy chose to begin the days in his astronomical periods at noon. He chose noon because the transit of the Sun across the observer's meridian occurs at the same apparent time every day of the year, unlike sunrise or sunset, which vary by several hours. Midnight was not even considered because it could not be accurately determined using water clocks. Nevertheless, he double-dated most nighttime observations with both Egyptian days beginning at sunrise and Babylonian days beginning at sunset. This would seem to imply that his choice of noon was \"not\", as is sometimes stated, made in order to allow all observations from a given night to be recorded with the same date. When this practice ended in 1925, it was decided to keep Julian days continuous with previous practice.\n\nThe Julian day number can be calculated using the following formulas (integer division is used exclusively, that is, the remainders of all divisions are dropped):\n\n\"The months January to December are numbered 1 to 12. For the year, astronomical year numbering is used, thus 1 BC is 0, 2 BC is −1, and 4713 BC is −4712. \"JDN\" is the Julian Day Number. Use the previous day of the month if trying to find the JDN of an instant before midday UT.\"\n\nThe algorithm is valid for all (possibly proleptic) Gregorian calendar dates after November 23, −4713.\n\nJDN = (1461 × (Y + 4800 + (M − 14)/12))/4 +(367 × (M − 2 − 12 × ((M − 14)/12)))/12 − (3 × ((Y + 4900 + (M - 14)/12)/100))/4 + D − 32075\n\nThe algorithm is valid for all (possibly proleptic) Julian calendar years ≥ −4712, that is, for all JDN ≥ 0.\n\nJDN = 367 × Y − (7 × (Y + 5001 + (M − 9)/7))/4 + (275 × M)/9 + D + 1729777\n\nFor the full Julian Date of a moment after 12:00 UT one can use the following (divisions are real numbers):\n\nformula_1\n\nSo, for example, January 1, 2000, at 18:00:00 UT corresponds to \"JD\" = 2451545.25\n\nFor a point in time in a given Julian day after midnight UT and before 12:00 UT, add 1 or use the JDN of the next afternoon.\n\nThe US day of the week W1 (for an afternoon or evening UT) can be determined from the Julian Day Number J with the expression:\n\nIf the moment in time is after midnight UT (and before 12:00 UT), then one is already in the next day of the week.\n\nThe ISO day of the week W0 can be determined from the Julian Day Number J with the expression:\n\nThis is an algorithm by Richards to convert a Julian Day Number, J, to a date in the Gregorian calendar (proleptic, when applicable). Richards states the algorithm is valid for Julian day numbers greater than or equal to 0. All variables are integer values, and the notation \"\"a\" div \"b\"\" indicates integer division, and \"mod(\"a\",\"b\")\" denotes the modulus operator.\n\nFor Julian calendar:\nFor Gregorian calendar:\nFor Julian or Gregorian, continue:\n\nD, M, and Y are the numbers of the day, month, and year respectively for the afternoon at the beginning of the given Julian day.\n\nLet Y be the year BC or AD and i, m and s respectively its positions in the indiction, Metonic and solar cycles.\nDivide 6916i + 4200m + 4845s by 7980 and call the remainder r.\n\nExample\n\ni = 8, m = 2, s = 8. What is the year?\n\nAs stated above, the Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number for the preceding noon in Universal Time plus the fraction of the day since that instant. Ordinarily calculating the fractional portion of the JD is straightforward; the number of seconds that have elapsed in the day divided by the number of seconds in a day, 86,400. But if the UTC timescale is being used, a day containing a positive leap second contains 86,401 seconds (or in the unlikely event of a negative leap second, 86,399 seconds). One authoritative source, the Standards of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA), deals with this issue by treating days containing a leap second as having a different length (86,401 or 86,399 seconds, as required). SOFA refers to the result of such a calculation as \"quasi-JD\".\n\n"}

It was also the former FSM capital before being replaced by Palikir in 1989, located nearby to the southwest in the municipality of Sokehs. It has about 6,000 people.\n\nKolonia Town is located in the north central section of Pohnpei Island. It was formerly part of Nett municipality, but is a separate municipality since May 1965. The population of the town was 6,074 (2010 Census). It is the largest population center on Pohnpei and the commercial hub of the island. The land area of Kolonia amounts to 1.5 km², with a large number of buildings lying just outside the town limits.\n\nKolonia's history is deeply marked by Pohnpei's multiple foreign occupiers, and evidence of their former presence is found throughout the town and island. Traditionally, Pohnpei's power center was in Madolenihmw, on the southeastern part of the island. The area now known as Kolonia was called \"Mesenieng\", which means \"face of the wind\" or \"head wind.\" Spain first built the town in 1887 as an administrative and military capital and named it \"Santiago de la Ascensión\". A fort, from which ruins known as the Spanish Wall remain, was built to protect the colonial government and garrison.\n\nIn 1899, as a consequence of the Spanish–American War, Germany purchased Pohnpei from Spain along with the rest of the Caroline Islands and established district offices in Kolonia. Roads and wharfs were built and buildings erected (a church bell tower and cemetery remain), but the town stayed relatively small as few German or other foreign settlers arrived to live on the island. Kolonia and northern Pohnpei were devastated by a typhoon in 1905.\n\nJapan occupied Pohnpei in the first weeks of World War I as well as other German islands north of the equator. Unlike previous occupiers, the Japanese brought thousands of settlers to Micronesia, who outnumbered the indigenous population on some islands. These settlers, most of whom were Okinawans, vastly expanded the infrastructure in addition to establishing settlements elsewhere on Pohnpei. Visitors to Kolonia in the 1930s reported that they were able to walk the length of Namiki Street (now Kaselelhie Street) under shopkeepers' canopies without getting wet in the rain.\n\nDuring World War II, much of Kolonia was destroyed as some 118 tons of American bombs, 600 incendiaries and naval artillery targeted the town and island installations. Pohnpei was bypassed during the amphibious island hopping campaigns, but rusting wrecks of Japanese military equipment, downed airplanes and bunkers are still visible throughout the island. The town was rebuilt and expanded during the US Navy and later US Department of the Interior administrations. The Federated States of Micronesia Constitutional Referendum and the Compact of Free Association led to independence in 1986.\n\nToday, construction in various parts of town continues and all of Kolonia's primary and secondary streets are paved and street signs erected. Kolonia Town boasts Pohnpei State government offices, public and private schools, grocery stores, restaurants, bars, hotels and houses of worship of various religious denominations.\n\nPohnpei International Airport (IATA code: PNI) is located on the small island Deketik and is connected to Kolonia via the Deketik causeway.\n\nThe United States, Australia, China and Japan maintain embassies in Kolonia, although the Federation‘s capital is now at Palikir. A number of foreign volunteer groups operate in Kolonia, including the Peace Corps, the Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers (JOCV or JICA), WorldTeach, the Red Cross, the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, the Spanish Mercedarian Missionaries of Berriz, the Conservation Society of Pohnpei (CSP), and Pacific Missionary Aviation (PMA).\n\nPohnpei State Department of Education operates public schools:\n\nPrivate schools:\n\n\n"}

In the south, a road border crossing leads to the neighbouring Austrian municipality of Drasenhofen. The highway is part of the European route E461 and is to be extended as the R52 expressway.\n\nMikulov is situated between the Pavlovské vrchy hilly area and the edge of the Mikulov Highlands, stretching up to the Thaya river and the three Nové Mlýny reservoirs. The Pálava Protected Landscape Area begins in Mikulov, and so does the Moravian Karst.\n\nAfter the Margraviate of Moravia was established, the settlement of \"Nikulsburch\" was first mentioned in a 1249 deed, issued by the Přemyslid margrave Ottokar II who granted it, including a castle, and the surrounding area to the Austrian noble Henry I of Liechtenstein. In 1262 the possession was confirmed by Ottokar, Bohemian king since 1253. After King Rudolf I of Germany had defeated Ottokar at the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, he then vested Henry II of Liechtenstein with market rights \"in villa Nicolspurch\". German citizens were called in and lived there until their expulsion in 1945 according to the Beneš decrees.\n\nIn 1526, the Anabaptist leader Balthasar Hubmaier came from Switzerland to Nikolsburg, where he was captured and arrested by the forces of the Habsburg king Ferdinand I in the following year. The town remained in the Liechtenstein family until 1560, and in 1572 Emperor Maximilian II granted the fief to his ambassador to the Spanish court Adam von Dietrichstein. From 1575 until the 20th century, Nikolsburg remained the proprietary possession of the Dietrichstein noble family and its Mensdorff-Pouilly successors.\n\nIn 1621, during the Thirty Years' War, Cardinal Franz von Dietrichstein signed the Treaty of Nikolsburg with the Transylvanian prince Gabriel Bethlen at Mikulov Castle. Four years later, Emperor Ferdinand II and his aulic council met at the castle, where General Albrecht von Wallenstein received his commission and was elevated to a Duke of Friedland. Franz von Dietrichstein also established the first Piarist college north of the Alps in Nikolsburg.\n\nAfter a fire damaged the original Nikolsburg Castle in 1719, the Dietrichstein family reconstructed the château to its present appearance. After the Austro-Prussian War, Count Alajos Károlyi began work on a peace treaty in Nikolsburg that led to the Treaty of Prague in 1866.\n\nThe beginning of the Jewish settlement in Nikolsburg dates as far as 1421, when Jews were expelled from Vienna and the neighboring province of Lower Austria by the duke of Austria, Albert II of Germany. The refugees settled in the town situated close to the Austrian border, some from the Austrian capital, under the protection of the princes of Liechtenstein, and additional settlers were brought after the expulsions of the Jews from the Moravian royal boroughs by the king Ladislaus the Posthumous after 1454.\n\nThe settlement grew in importance and in the first half of the 16th century Nikolsburg became the seat of the regional rabbi of Moravia, thus becoming a cultural centre of Moravian Jewry. The famous rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel (1525 – 1609), who is said to have created the golem of Prague, officiated here for twenty years as the second regional rabbi between 1553 and 1573. Cardinal Franz von Dietrichstein, son of Adam von Dietrichstein, was a special protector of the Jews, whose taxes were necessary to finance the Thirty Years' War.\n\nIn the first half of the 18th century, the congregation in Nikolsburg totalled over 600 families, being the largest Jewish settlement in Moravia. The census of 1754 decreed by Empress Maria Theresa of Austria ascertained that there were some 620 families established in Nikolsburg, i.e. the Jewish population of about 3,000 comprised half of the town's inhabitants. Only a small number of Jews could make their living in the town as artisans; the rest had to become merchants. The congregation suffered severely during the Silesian wars (1740–1742, 1744–1745 and 1756–1763), when they had to furnish the monarchy with their share in the supertaxes exacted by the government of Maria Theresa from the Jews of Moravia.\n\nQuite a number of Nikolsburg Jews continued to earn their livelihood in Vienna, where they were permitted to stay for some time on special passports. The freedom of residence, which was conceded to the Jews in Austria in 1848, reduced the number of resident Jews in Nikolsburg to less than one-third of the population which it contained at the time of its highest development. In 1904, there were 749 Jewish residents in the city, out of a total population of 8,192. In 1938, prior to the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the city population totaled about 8,000 mostly German-speaking inhabitants. Out of these, 472 were Jewish at this time. The Jewish settlement in Nikolsburg ceased to exist during World War II, as only 110 managed to emigrate in time, and 327 of Mikulov's Jews did not survive the Holocaust.\n\nFollowing World War II, the town's German population was brutally expelled between 1945-46 by the Czech Communist Government. In 1948, Mikulov's population was around 5,200.\n\nMikulov is a centre of Czech wine-making due to its favorable geographic location and climate, as well as its unique history. Mikulov is not only the centre, but the namesake of, the Moravian wine sub-region \"vinarská podoblast Mikulovská\". Twelve registered cadastral vineyard tracts (Czech: \"trat\") are situated within the Mikulov wine village as defined under the Czech Viticulture Act. Other significant economic activities in Mikulov are the machine-making and clay industries, as well as oil found at the edge of the Viennese Basin.\n\nMikulov's historic buildings, such as Mikulov Castle, and the surrounding wine country draw tourists from the Czech Republic and neighboring countries. Beginning in Mikulov, the 65 kilometer long Mikulov Wine Trail winds throughout the Mikulov wine region and is a part of wine tourism in the area. Other noteworthy historic sights are the Dietrichstein sepulchre, the old Jewish Quarter, and the Piarist College. Several historic churches and a synagogue, built in various architectural styles, are located in Mikulov, including the Romanesque Church of St. Václav and charnel house, the Baroque Church of St. John the Baptist, St. Sebastian Chapel on the Holy Hill (\"Svatý Kopeček\"), the neo-Gothic Eastern Christian Church of St. Nicolas, and the Altschul Synagogue.\n\n\n\nMikulov is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

A few hundred survived and returned to the town after the war. Their efforts to regain property that had been \"aryanized\" increased the hostility and antisemitism of the non-Jewish Slovaks, who began to mount a campaign of intimidation to encourage the Jews to renounce their claims and leave the country. More than 40 Jews were injured in a September 1945 riot, referred to as the Topoľčany pogrom, which became the best known instance of postwar anti-Jewish violence in Slovakia. In the years following the riot, many Jews emigrated. There is no longer a Jewish community in Topoľčany.\n\nDuring the filming of the documentary, an elderly resident of Topoľčany said, \"Jews and Gypsies are the worst scum under the sun. While they are in the world, there will be no order\". , the director-general of STV, which had commissioned the documentary, asked Hudec to remove the statement because of concern that it violated the Broadcasting and Retransmission Act on protection of human dignity and humanity. Hudec disagreed and strongly objected, telling reporters that without the line, the film would be a study of past racism in Slovakia, but that the inclusion of the statement brought the historical issues into the present. Despite the general agreement of several lawyers that the statement did not violate the law, the station insisted on its removal.\n\nThe Central Federation of Jewish Religious Congregations condemned the removal of the statement, stating that the censorship was a \"warning signal about the present direction of the Slovak public TV\". It raised concerns about Rybníček's connections with far-right groups. In response, a manager of STV stated that \"We would not like this problem to be politicised in any way.\"\n\nThe documentary was screened on Slovak television on 24 May 2004. Its release had been delayed due to the controversy over the removed statement.\n\nSlovak historian Ivan Kamenec praised the documentary for bringing the postwar Jewish history to the attention of a wider audience. The Slovak newspaper said that the documentary was probably the best Slovak documentary to premiere in 2004.\n\nSome commentators accused the documentary of anti-Catholicism, pointing out that the church in Topoľčany is the main visual focus, and the documentary did not mention that some Catholic Church officials opposed the Holocaust. The Slovak writer Peter Bielik criticized the film, citing contemporary reports claiming that \"the Jews behaved very arrogantly and imperiously, trying to systematically occupy important positions in the economic, public, and political spheres\". Because of the controversy over these remarks, he withdrew from consideration for director of the National Memory Institute.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "457922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457922", "title": "Pachuco", "text": "Pachuco\n\nPachuco refers to a subculture of Chicanos and Mexican-Americans, associated with zoot suits, street gangs, nightlife, and flamboyant public behavior. The idea of the pachuco – a zoot-suited, well-dressed, street-connected flamboyant playboy of Hispanic/Latino heritage – originated in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, had moved north, following the line of migration of Mexican railroad workers (\"traqueros\") into Los Angeles, where it developed further.\n\nA pachuca is the female counterpart, often idealized as a beautiful Chicana woman in extravagant evening dress or a female version of the zoot suit, out with a pachuco boyfriend for a night on the town. Pachucas broke taboos of their time by wearing men's-style pants sometimes and appearing in public often with their pachuco boyfriends; at the time, a \"good woman\" was considered to have her place in the home. American women were not encouraged to wear pants, as it was seen as strictly masculine. Because of this, outsiders saw Pachucas as rebellious, tacky, and un-American. This created a larger gap between Mexican-Americans and the rest of the community. However, this was not the intention of the Pachuco/Pachuca style. Pachucas strove to prove that their community fits in to American culture and that they were not of lesser value socially and economically. In order to portray this, they created their suits with luxurious and expensive fabrics. Pachucas made their own clothes and created a space for self expression through fashion. They defied male/female stereotypes and roles in Mexican-American culture in much the same way flappers had in European-American culture in the 1920s.\n\nThe origin of the term \"pachuco\" is uncertain, but one theory connects it to the city of El Paso, Texas, which was sometimes referred to as \"Chuco Town\" or \"El Chuco.\" People migrating to El Paso would say, in Spanish, that they were going \"pa' El Chuco.\" These migrants became known as pachucos.\n\nThe name \"Pachuco\" is quite possibly derived from the name of the city of Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico. There have long been migrants from Hidalgo state living in Texas.\n\nAnother theory says that the word derives from \"pocho\", a derogatory term for a Mexican born in the United States who has lost touch with the Mexican culture. The word is also said to mean \"punk\" or \"troublemaker\". Yet another theory is put forth by author Laura L. Cummings who postulates a possible indigenous origin of the term. The founder of the \"Pachuco\" subculture was a Mexican comedian and film actor named German Valdés better-known by his Artistic name \"Tin-Tan\". He introduced the Pachuco dress and slang throughout his Golden age-era films.\n\nConnections have also been found between \"Pachucos\" and mixed civilians who lived near the Mexican–American border during the turn of the century, and between \"Pachucos\" and the poor soldiers who fought in the Mexican Revolution in the armies of Pancho Villa.\n\nPachucos called their slang Caló (sometimes called \"pachuquismo\"), a unique argot that drew on the original Spanish Gypsy Caló, Mexican Spanish, the New Mexican dialect of Spanish, and American English, employing words and phrases creatively applied. To a large extent, Caló went mainstream and is one of the last surviving vestige of the Pachuco, often used in the lexicon of some urban Latinos in the United States to this day. The influence of Valdés is responsible for the assimilation of several Caló terms into Mexican slang.\n\nThe Mexican Nobel laureate Octavio Paz writes in the essay, \"The \"Pachuco\" and Other Extremes\" that the Pachuco phenomenon paralleled the zazou subculture in World War II-era Paris in style of clothing, music favored (jazz, swing, and jump blues), and attitudes. Although there was no known link between the two subcultures, they both are most certainly derivative localized blends of American pop culture in the United States.\n\nPachuco culture in America was at its height during World War II. The Wartime Productions Board in 1942 thought it necessary to cut back on fabric consumption, so they enacted regulations on the amount of fabric used for suits. This enactment targeted Pachucos in particular because of the excess fabric used in their zoot suits. Pachucos boldly chose not to follow these regulations, demonstrating rebellious attitudes and pride in their culture. Pachucos continued to flaunt zoot suits, now attained through bootleg tailors. As a result, these flashy zoot suits were seen as unpatriotic by other Americans. This controversial series of events helped shape Pachuco culture, and zoot suits became a symbol of cultural pride among Mexican-Americans. It didn't all end well, however, as this also led to rising tension between Pachucos and other Americans, playing a part in the start of the 1944 Zoot Suit Riots.\n\nThe pachuco subculture declined in the 1960s, evolving into the Chicano style. This style preserved some of the pachuco slang while adding a strong political element characteristic of the late 1960s American life.\n\nIn the early 1970s, a recession and the increasingly violent nature of gang life resulted in an abandonment of anything that suggested dandyism. Accordingly, Mexican-American gangs adopted a uniform of T-shirts and khakis derived from prison uniforms, and the pachuco style died out. However, the zoot suit remains a popular choice of formal wear for urban and rural Latino youths in heavily ethnic Mexican neighborhoods. It is typically worn at a prom, in weddings, parties or in some cases, at informal Latino university commencement ceremonies.\n\nThe term \"\" is used in Costa Rica to define Costa Rican slang. It nevertheless differs from the Mexican slang.\nIn Costa Rica the term \"pachuco\" refers to someone who has common habits and who is often very rude. In Costa Rica the word pachuco refers to a person who has manners that are socially unacceptable and often uses shocking language when speaking. Pachuco is also a pejorative name given to certain colloquial words and expressions. Some consider pachuco and its pachuquísmos to be Costa Rica's second language.\n\nPachuco style was a dominating trend among Mexican-American youth in the 1930s-40s. Pachucos became known for their distinguished look, dialogue, and actions. Pachucos dressed in recognizable Zoot suits, and often styled their hair into ducktails. Things like decorative chains and tattoos were also sometimes part of the pachuco look. The unique speech of pachucos was a very important element of their defined style. Consisting of creative phrases and some English words, Caló (Chicano) was a very popular form of speech among pachucos. Pachucos were seen as gangsters in the eyes of other Americans, because of the activities they participated in. They often carried concealed weapons and were involved in criminal activities such as vandalism and gang-related misdemeanors.\n\nThe \"Pachuca,\" the female counterpart of the Pachuco, had an aesthetic sensibility as strong as the male zoot suiter. The Pachuca's hairstyle tended to be a high \"coif\" or bouffant, with the hair put up in some way (a more pronounced version of the typical hair style of the time), sometimes using hair grease. Their makeup was heavy, particularly using a red colored lipstick. The preferred colors of clothing were black and gray. Some pachucas wore the traditionally male zoot suit, albeit with modifications to fit the female form. This was very subversive at the time because of long-held gender roles that dictated how a person should dress. Sometimes, she donned the standard heavy gold pocket chain. Another variation involved a sweater or coat - often a variant on the male zoot-suit finger-tip jacket - over knee-length skirts, plus fishnet stockings or bobby socks and platform shoes. Extravagant dresses were and are also common among pachucas. Like the entire culture, the fashion aesthetic revolved around the concept of \"see and be seen\".\n\nThis style was associated with gang membership and activity largely due to the Zoot Suit Riots that took place in Southern California in 1943. The negative image of the male zoot suiter as a \"violent gangster\" naturally extended to the Pachuca as well. The promiscuous image came from the Pachuca's high public visibility and patronage of nightlife with pachucos. This image contrasted with the traditional Latino-American image of femininity at the time which held that the \"good\" minority woman stayed in the home.\n\nThe Pachuca's challenge to the dominant perception of femininity came during the period between the advent of women's suffrage in 1920 and the upsurge in feminist activism of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n"}

Nations, cultures, families, and even individuals, each with their different remembered histories, are constantly engaged in imposing overlapping, often unsystematized, schemes of temporal periodization; periodizing labels are continually challenged and redefined, but once established, a period \"brand\" is so convenient that many are \"very hard\" to change or shake off.\n\nThe division of history into \"ages\" or periods is very old, and recorded practically as early as the first development of writing. \nThe Sumerian King List operates with dynastic regnal eras. \nThe classical division into a Golden Age, Silver Age, Bronze Age, Heroic Age and Iron Age goes back to Hesiod.\nOne Biblical periodization scheme commonly used in the Middle Ages was Saint Paul's theological division of history into three ages: the first before the age of Moses (under nature); the second under Mosaic law (under law); the third in the age of Christ (under grace). But perhaps the most widely discussed periodization scheme of the Middle Ages was the Six Ages of the World, where every age was a thousand years counting from Adam to the present, with the present time (in the Middle Ages) being the sixth and final stage.\n\nNot only do periodizing blocks inevitably overlap, they often seemingly conflict with or contradict one another. Some have a cultural usage (\"the Gilded Age\"), others refer to prominent historical events (\"the Inter-War years: 1918–1939\"), yet others are defined by decimal numbering systems (\"the 1960s\", \"the 17th century\"). Other periods are named from influential or talismanic individuals (\"the Victorian Era\", \"the Edwardian Era\", \"the Napoleonic Era\").\n\nSome of these usages will also be geographically specific. This is especially true of periodizing labels derived from individuals or ruling dynasties, such as the Jacksonian Era in America, the Meiji Era in Japan, or the Merovingian Period in France. Cultural terms may also have a limited reach. Thus the concept of the \"Romantic period\" is largely meaningless outside the Western world of Europe and European-influenced cultures. Likewise, \"the 1960s\", though technically applicable to anywhere in the world according to Common Era numbering, has a certain set of specific cultural connotations in certain countries. For this reason it may be possible to say such things as \"The 1960s never occurred in Spain\". This would mean that the sexual revolution, counterculture, youth rebellion and so on never developed during that decade in Spain's conservative Roman Catholic culture and under Francisco Franco's authoritarian regime. Likewise it is very often said, as the historian Arthur Marwick has, that \"the 1960s\" began in the late 1950s and ended in the early 1970s. His reason for saying this is that the cultural and economic conditions that define the meaning of the period covers more than the accidental fact of a 10-year block beginning with the number 6. This extended usage is termed the \"long 1960s\". This usage derives from other historians who have adopted labels such as \"the long 19th century\" (1789–1914) to reconcile arbitrary decimal chronology with meaningful cultural and social phases. Similarly, an Eighteenth Century may run 1714–1789. Eric Hobsbawm has also argued for what he calls \"the short twentieth century\", encompassing the period from the First World War through to the end of the Cold War.\n\nSimilar problems attend other labels. Is it possible to use the term \"Victorian\" outside Britain, and even within, does her reign of 1837-1901 usefully constitute a historical period? It sometimes is used when it is thought that its connotations usefully describe the politics, culture and economic conditions characteristic of the last two-thirds of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, periodizing terms often have negative or positive connotations that may affect their usage. This includes \"Victorian\", which often negatively suggests sexual repression and class conflict. Other labels such as \"Renaissance\" have strongly positive characteristics. As a result, these terms sometimes extend in meaning. Thus the \"English Renaissance\" is often used for a period largely identical to the \"Elizabethan Period\" or reign of Elizabeth I, and begins some 200 years later than the Italian Renaissance. However the \"Carolingian Renaissance\" is said to have occurred during the reign of the Frankish king Charlemagne, and his immediate successors. Other examples, neither of which constituted a \"rebirth\" in the sense of revival, are the \"American Renaissance\" of the 1820s-60s, referring mainly to literature, and the \"Harlem Renaissance\" of the 1920s, referring mainly to literature but also to music and the visual arts.\n\nThe conception of a \"rebirth\" of Classical Latin learning is first credited to the Italian poet Petrarch (1304-1374), the father of Renaissance Humanism, but the conception of a rebirth has been in common use since Petrarch's time. The dominant usage of the word \"Renaissance\" refers to the cultural changes that occurred in Italy that culminated in the High Renaissance around 1500-1530. This concept applies dominantly to the visual arts, and the work of Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci. Secondarily it is applied to other arts, but it is questionable whether it is useful to describe a phase in economic, social and political history. Many professional historians now refer to the historical periods commonly known as the Renaissance and the Reformation as the start of the Early Modern Period, which extends much later. There is a gradual change in the courses taught and books published to correspond to the change in period nomenclature, which in part reflects differences between social history and cultural history. The new nomenclature suggests a broader geographical coverage and a growing attention to the relationships between Europe and the wider world.\n\nThe term Middle Ages also derives from Petrarch. He was comparing his own period to the Ancient or Classical world, seeing his time as a time of rebirth after a dark intermediate period, the Middle Ages. The idea that the Middle Ages was a \"middle\" phase between two other large scale periodizing concepts, Ancient and Modern, still persists. It can be sub-divided into the Early, High and Late Middle Ages. The term Dark Ages is no longer in common use among modern scholars because of the difficulty of using it neutrally, though some writers have attempted to retain it and divest it of its negative connotations. The term \"Middle Ages\" and especially the adjective \"medieval\" can also have a negative ring in colloquial use (\"the barbaric treatment of prisoners in such-and-such a prison is almost medieval\") but this does not carry over into academic terminology. However, other terms, such as Gothic architecture, used to refer to a style typical of the High Middle Ages have largely lost the negative connotations they initially had, acquiring new meanings over time (see Gothic architecture and Goth subculture).\n\nThe Gothic and the Baroque were both named during subsequent stylistic periods when the preceding style was unpopular. The word \"Gothic\" was applied as a pejorative term to all things Northern European and, hence, barbarian, probably first by Giorgio Vasari. Vasari is also credited with first using the term \"Renaissance\" (\"rinascita\") to describe the period during which he was art historian, artist, and architect. Giorgio Vasari coined the term \"Gothic\" in an effort to describe, particularly architecture, that he found objectionable, supposedly saying \"it is as if the Goths built it\". The word \"baroque\"—derived from similar words in Portuguese, Spanish, or French—literally refers to an irregular or misshapen pearl. Its first use outside the field of jewellery manufacture was in the early 18th century, as a criticism of music that was viewed as over-complicated and rough. Later, the term was also used to describe architecture and art. The Baroque period was first designated as such in the 19th century, and is generally considered to have begun around 1600 in all media. Music history places the end of the period in the year 1750 with the death of J. S. Bach, while art historians consider the main period to have ended significantly earlier in most areas.\n\nThe usual method for periodization of the distant prehistoric past, in archeology is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used.\n\nSome events or short periods of change have such a drastic effect on the cultures they affect that they form a natural break in history. These are often marked by the widespread use of both \"pre-\" and \"post-\" phrases centred on the event, as in \"pre-Reformation\" and \"post-Reformation\", or \"pre-colonial\" and \"post-colonial\". Both pre-war and post-war are still understood to refer to World War II, though at some future point the phrases will need to be altered to make that clear.\n\nThe Marxist theory of historical materialism claims society as fundamentally determined by the \"material conditions\" at any given time – in other words, the relationships, which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families. Overall, Marx and Engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe.\n\nThe theory identifies the following stages of history:\n\nThe First Stage: is usually called primitive communism. It has the following characteristics.\n\nThe Second Stage: may be called slave society, considered to be the beginning of \"class society\" where private property appears.\n\nThe Third Stage: may be called feudalism; it appears after slave society collapses. This was most obvious during the European Middle Ages when society went from slavery to feudalism.\n\nMarx pays special attention to this stage in human development. The bulk of his work is devoted to analysing the mechanisms of capitalism, which, in western society, classically arose \"red in tooth and claw\" from feudal society in a revolutionary movement. In capitalism, the profit motive rules and people, freed from serfdom, work for the capitalists for wages. The capitalist class are free to spread their laissez faire practices around the world. In the capitalist-controlled parliament, laws are made to protect wealth.\n\nCapitalism may be considered the Fourth Stage in the sequence. It appears after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrow the feudal system. Capitalism is categorized by the following:\n\nAccording to Marx, capitalism has critical failings — inner contradictions — which lead to its downfall. The working class, to which the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits, is the \"grave digger\" of capitalism. The worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces. The rest is surplus value — the capitalist's profit, which Marx calls the \"unpaid labour of the working class.\" The capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the working class to increase their profits, and this creates conflict between the classes, and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the working class. The working class, through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious of itself as an exploited class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the working class to establish its own collective control over production.\n\nAfter the working class gains class consciousness and mounts a revolution against the capitalists, socialism, which may be considered the Fifth Stage, will be attained, if the workers are successful.\n\nSocialism may be characterised as follows:\n\nMarx explained that, since socialism, the first stage of communism, would be \"in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges\", each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor he contributes, despite the fact that each worker's ability and family circumstances would differ, so that the results would still be unequal at this stage, although fully supported by social provision.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8691549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8691549", "title": "Ras Burqa massacre", "text": "Ras Burqa massacre\n\nThe Ras Burqa massacre was a shooting attack in October 1985 on Israeli vacationers in Ras Burqa, a beach resort area in the Sinai peninsula, in which seven, including four children, were killed by Egyptian soldier Suleiman Khater.\n\nOn 5 October 1985, an Egyptian soldier, Sulayman Khatir, machine-gunned a group of Israelis, killing three adults and four young children, on the dunes of Ras Burqa. The only survivor was 5-year old Tali Griffel, whose mother, Anita, shielded her with her body. According to eyewitnesses, the Egyptian Central Security Forces who were nearby refused to help the wounded; furthermore, they stopped an Israeli doctor and other tourists at gunpoint from administering any aid to the victims of the shooting, and the wounded Israelis were left to bleed to death. Egyptian authorities countered that the Israelis bled to death \"because this crazy soldier refused to let anyone near the area that some of the victims lay\". The gunman killed one of the Egyptian policeman who tried to arrest him.\" Israel protested the Egyptian refusal to allow the victims to be treated by Israeli doctors or transferred to hospitals in Israel.\n\nKhatir said the killings were not intentional. He said he could only see a group of people coming towards him in the dark, refusing his orders to stop.\n\nIn an interview with Peace Now, Tali Griffel described her memories of the attack: \"For many years, I didn't think about what happened. I just blocked out everything and then slowly, slowly I sort of regained feeling. I remember as the shooting started, my mother grabbed me and lay down, putting me under her. She whispered to me, keeping me calm. I can still recall the feeling of the jolt as she got shot. Yet, she continued to hold me and talk to me as she bled to death. When I crawled out, I sat there alone for a very long time. The Egyptian police came and took me away to a dark room where they interrogated me for hours.\"\n\nSeven people were killed in the attack:\n\nAfter the shootings, Egyptian authorities claimed that the perpetrator Sulayman Khatir was mentally ill. During the initial interrogations, Khatir claimed that he had been unaware of the identity or nationality of the people he had shot and that they had made no offense or provocation toward him. The only reason why he had opened fire was that, as Khatir said, they had trespassed on a prohibited territory. He was tried by a closed military tribunal and on 28 December 1985 sentenced to life in prison at hard labor. Ten days later, on 8 January 1986, Khatir was found dead in his prison hospital room hanging by a strip torn from a sheet of plastic. The authorities declared his death a suicide. Opposition parties in Egypt claimed that he had been murdered.\nAfter Khater's death, the Iranian government of Ayatollah Khomeini issued a stamp \"In honour of the martyrdom of Sulayman Khater, Hero of Sinai\", and named a street in Tehran for him.\n\nEgyptian opposition politicians hailed Khatir as \"hero of Sinai\" for committing the massacre of Israelis. The glorification of Khatir as a national hero in the Egyptian opposition press was echoed in other Arab countries, and mass demonstrations were held in his support. Attempting to justify his actions, the press did not report that all but one of the victims were women or children, but instead invented miscellaneous pretexts for the shootings. The press claimed that the Israeli tourists were spies caught photographing secret military installations, that they spat upon and tore up an Egyptian flag, that half-naked Israeli women offended Khatir's Muslim conscience, or that the tourists attacked him. The pro-governmental press remained silent regarding the facts of the massacre, leaving the claims unchallenged. Many Egyptian intellectuals and religious leaders joined in extolling Khatir and his act. Umar al-Tilimsani, the leader of Muslim Brotherhood, said that \"if every Muslim would do what Sulayman did, Israel would no longer exist\". Farid Abd al-Karim, one of the leaders of the Arab Socialist Party, called Khatir \"the conscience of this nation\", whose bullets \"washed away the shame\" of the Camp David Peace Accords between Israel and Egypt. Ahmad Nasir of the Egyptian Bar Association claimed that history would always honor Khatir as \"a living model of a noble Egyptian who refused to be led astray by the treaties of betrayal and surrender\".\n\nThe response of Egyptian president Mubarak was that \"Unfortunately these things happen. They cannot reflect on the entire country.\" Mubarak's lack of intervention until in a late stage in attempts to present Khatir as a martyred hero hampered efforts to reach an accord on Taba.\n\nSome prominent Egyptians expressed doubt that Khatir was insane. Farid Abd al-Karim wished that the whole Egypt \"would be struck with this same mighty madness\". Ali Hillal Dessouki, a professor at the University of Cairo, said he was astonished that such men as Khatir could be accused of madness and expressed his sadness for the \"so-called sane\". Nur al-Sharif, an actor, told Khatir: \"You are the sanest among us, for you did what we all want.\"\n\nThe beginning of Khatir's trial sparked a wave of protest rallies, which the Egyptian government saw as a threat to itself. More than 140 people were arrested, most at Zagazig University in the Nile Delta where Khatir had been enrolled as a law student. For the first time, the progovernment press published the real story behind the massacre, revealing that the victims were women and children. The editor of \"Al-Musawar\" journal criticized the opposition press for its handling of the story.\n\nAn Egyptian newspaper published on February 2014 letters written by Khater, alongside the testimonies of his friends who visited him in prison in his last days. \nThe letters suggest that Hater was mysteriously murdered in prison, and did not commit suicide, as published at the time in Egypt. Before his death Khater told his friends that prison security officials offered to let him escape, and that he suspected that they were looking for an excuse to shoot him. Khater told his friends that there was no reason to run away, because the prison is located deep in the desert. His mother testified that upon hearing this story she felt that her son was in danger. In one of the two letters, in the possession of his friends, Khater said that he was furious at Israel's treatment of Egypt, its attacks on Lebanon, and the many activities of the Israeli Air Force in the Sinai - despite the peace agreement. In a second letter he published a list of the weapons in the hands of his army unit, and in front of her - a description of Israel's air operations in the region. Two lists indicates a large gap in favor of the Israeli army. A friend of Khater, who visited him two days before his death, said Khater was in a good mood and uplifted and nothing indicated his intention to commit suicide.\n\nIn 1986, as part of the Taba talks, Egypt agreed to submit a report on the murder at Ras Burka, and discuss the question of reparations to the bereaved families. In early 1989, a special Egyptian legal committee awarded compensation to the victims. The Wall Street Journal said that the amounts were \"well within the norms of established international standards\" and the Sun-Sentinel wrote \"Egypt agreed to pay $500,000 in compensation\". Egypt also made a formal statement to the family of each victim \"expressing its acceptance of responsibility, its regret, and its condolences\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4843981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4843981", "title": "Recorded history", "text": "Recorded history\n\nRecorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. It contrasts with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. For broader world history, recorded history begins with the accounts of the ancient world around the 4th millennium BC, and coincides with the invention of writing. For some geographic regions or cultures, written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history because of the limited use of written records. Moreover, human cultures do not always record all of the information relevant to later historians, such as the full impact of natural disasters or the names of individuals; thus, recorded history for particular types of information is limited based on the types of records kept. Because of this, recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the topic.\n\nThe interpretation of recorded history often relies on historical method, or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past. The question of the nature, and even the possibility, of an effective method for interpreting recorded history is raised in the philosophy of history as a question of epistemology. The study of different historical methods is known as historiography, which focuses on examining how different interpreters of recorded history create different interpretations of historical evidence.\n\nPrehistory traditionally refers to the span of time before recorded history, ending with the invention of writing systems. Prehistory refers to the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood.\n\nProtohistory refers to the transition period between prehistory and history, after the advent of literacy in a society but before the writings of the first historians. Protohistory may also refer to the period during which a culture or civilization has not yet developed writing, but other cultures have noted its existence in their own writings.\n\nMore complete writing systems were preceded by proto-writing. Early examples are the Jiahu symbols (c. 6600 BCE), Vinča signs (c. 5300 BCE), early Indus script (c. 3500 BCE) and Nsibidi script (c. before 500 CE). There is disagreement concerning exactly when prehistory becomes history, and when proto-writing became \"true writing\" However, invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late Neolithic of the late 4th millennium BCE. The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BCE with earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BCE.\n\nThe earliest chronologies date back to the earliest civilizations of Early Dynastic Period Egypt, Mesopotamia & Sumerians which emerged independently of each other from roughly 3500 B.C. Earliest recorded history, which varies greatly in quality and reliability, deals with Pharaohs and their reigns, made by ancient Egyptians. Much of the earliest recorded history was re-discovered relatively recently due to archaeological dig sites findings. A number of different traditions have developed in different parts of the world as to how to interpret these ancient accounts.\n\nIn China, the earliest history was recorded in oracle bone script which was deciphered and may date back to around late 2nd millennium B.C.. The \"Zuo Zhuan\", attributed to Zuo Qiuming in the , is the earliest written of narrative history in the world and covers the period from . The \"Classic of History\" is one of the Five Classics of Chinese classic texts and one of the earliest narratives of China. The \"Spring and Autumn Annals\", the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from , is among the earliest surviving historical texts to be arranged on annalistic principles in the world. It is traditionally attributed to Confucius (551–479 B.C. ). \"Zhan Guo Ce\" was a renowned ancient Chinese historical compilation of sporadic materials on the Warring States period compiled between the .\n\nSima Qian (around ) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the \"Shiji\" (\"Records of the Grand Historian\"), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the , and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras. His work influenced every subsequent author of history in China, including the prestigious Ban family of the Eastern Han Dynasty era.\n\nHerodotus of Halicarnassus (484 B.C. – c. 425 B.C. ) has generally been acclaimed as the \"father of history\" composing his \"The Histories\" written from 450s to the 420s B.C. . However, his contemporary Thucydides (c. 460 B.C. – c. 400 B.C.) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the \"History of the Peloponnesian War\". Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.\n\nSaint Augustine was influential in Christian and Western thought at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and Renaissance periods, history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach in historical study.According to John Tosh, \"From the High Middle Ages (c.1000–1300) onwards, the written word survives in greater abundance than any other source for Western history.\" Western historians developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany, where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past. Many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives. In the 20th century, academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art, which traditionally had been the case. French historians associated with the Annales School introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the oldest historical text is the Mahavamsa. Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya maintained chronicles of Sri Lankan history starting from the third century BCE. These annals were combined and compiled into a single document in the 5th century by the Mahanama of Anuradhapura while Dhatusena of Anuradhapura was ruling the Anuradhapura Kingdom. It was written based on prior ancient compilations known as the \"Atthakatha\", which were commentaries written in Sinhala. An earlier document known as the \"Dipavamsa\"(4th century CE) \"Island Chronicles\" is much simpler and contains less information than the \"Mahavamsa\" and was probably compiled using the \"Atthakatha\" on the \"Mahavamsa\" as well.\n\nA companion volume, the \"Culavamsa\" \"Lesser Chronicle\", compiled by Sinhala monks, covers the period from the 4th century to the British takeover of Sri Lanka in 1815. The \"Culavamsa\" was compiled by a number of authors of different time periods.\n\nThe combined work, sometimes referred to collectively as the \"Mahavamsa\", provides a continuous historical record of over two millennia, and is considered one of the world's longest unbroken historical accounts. It is one of the few documents containing material relating to the Nāga and Yakkha peoples, indigenous inhabitants of Lanka prior to the legendary arrival of Prince Vijaya from Singha Pura of Kalinga.\n\nIn the preface to his book, the \"Muqaddimah\" (1377), the Arab historian and early sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. Ibn Khaldun often criticized \"idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data.\" As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his \"new science\". His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history, and he is thus considered to be the \"father of historiography\" or the \"father of the philosophy of history\".\n\nWhile recorded history begins with the invention of writing, over time new ways of recording history have come along with the advancement of technology. History can now be recorded through photography, audio recordings, and video recordings. More recently, Internet archives have been saving copies of webpages, documenting the history of the Internet. Other methods of collecting historical information have also accompanied the change in technologies; for example, since at least the 20th century, attempts have been made to preserve oral history by recording it. Until the 1990s this was done using analogue recording methods such as cassettes and reel-to-reel tapes. With the onset of new technologies, there are now digital recordings, which may be recorded to CDs. Nevertheless, historical record and interpretation often relies heavily on written records, partially because it dominates the extant historical materials, and partially because historians are used to communicating and researching in that medium.\n\nThe historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history. Primary sources are first-hand evidence of history (usually written, but sometimes captured in other mediums) made at the time of an event by a present person. Historians think of those sources as the closest to the origin of the information or idea under study. These types of sources can provide researchers with, as Dalton and Charnigo put it, \"direct, un-mediated information about the object of study.\"\n\nHistorians use other types of sources to understand history as well. Secondary sources are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyse, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. Tertiary sources are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources and often tell a more generalized account built on the more specific research found in the first two types of sources.\n\n\n"}

It includes approximately 100 square kilometres and has been theorized to be the site of the eponymous capital city of the Majapahit Empire, which is described by Mpu Prapanca in the 14th-century poem Nagarakretagama and in a 15th-century Chinese source. When it was the capital of the Majapahit Empire, the city was known as Wilwatikta, which is a name also synonymous with the empire's name. It was razed during the invasion of Girindrawardhana to defeat Kertabhumi in 1478. After this event Majapahit's capital was moved to Daha (Kediri). The Trowulan Museum includes a collection of artifacts.\n\nThe Nagarakretagama contains poetic descriptions of the palace of Majapahit and its surroundings, but is limited to the royal and religious sectors. Some of the details are vague, and scholars who have tried to compile a plan of the capital have come to different conclusions.\n\nOlder research at Trowulan has concentrated on monumental remains: temples, tombs, and a bathing place. Archaeological surveys and excavations have recently found the remains of industrial, commercial and religious activity, habitation areas, water supply systems and water canals all of which are evidence of dense population during the 14th to 15th centuries. In October 2009 Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Indonesia submitted Trowulan as UNESCO World Heritage list.\n\nAccording to the account of Prapanca in the Nagarakretagama poem, the royal compound was surrounded by a thick, high wall of red brick. Nearby was the fortified guard post. The main gate into the palace was located in the north wall, and was entered through huge doors of decorated iron. Outside the north gate was a long building where courtiers met once a year, a market place, and a sacred crossroads. Just inside the north gate was a courtyard containing religious buildings. On the western side of this courtyard were pavilions surrounded by canals where people bathed. At the south end a gate led to rows of houses set on terraces in which palace servants lived. Another gate led to a third courtyard crowded with houses and a great hall for those waiting to be admitted into the ruler's presence. The king's own quarters, which lay to the east of this courtyard, had pavilions on decorated red brick bases, ornately carved wooden pillars, and a roof decorated with clay ornaments. Outside the palace were quarters for Shiva priests, Buddhists, and other members of the nobility. Further away, and separated from the palace by open fields, were more royal compounds, including that of the chief minister Gajah Mada. Here Prapanca's descriptions end.\n\nA 15th-century Chinese source describes the palace as clean and well kept. It was said to have been enclosed within a brick wall more than 10 metres high and with a double gate. The houses inside were built on pillars and were 10–13 metres high, with wooden floors covered with fine mats on which people sat. Roofs were made from wooden shingles and the dwellings of the common people were roofed with straw.\n\nA book on Majapahit court etiquette defines the capital as 'All where one can go out without passing through paddy fields.' Temple reliefs from Majapahit do not depict urban scenes, but some contain sketches of settlements indicated as pavilions enclosed within walls. The word 'kuwu' in Nagarakretagama seems to refer the settlement units consisting of a group of buildings surrounded by wall, in which a large number of people lived under the control of a nobleman. This pattern characterised the 16th-century coastal cities of Java described by early European visitors, and Majapahit's capital was probably composed of such units.\n\nThe ancient city ruins at Trowulan had been discovered by the 19th century. Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, Lieutenant-Governor of British Java, Governor-General of Bencoolen from 1811 until 1816 and an indefatigable enthusiast for the island's history, reported the existence of ' \"ruins of temples... scattered about the country for many miles\" '. Much of the region was blanketed with dense teak forest at that time, making detailed survey impossible. Nonetheless, Raffles was so impressed by what he saw that he was later to refer to Trowulan as ' \"this pride of Java\" '.\n\nMost of archaeological relics discovered in Trowulan and its vicinity is stored and displayed in Trowulan Museum, located on west side of Segaran pool. Excavations in and around Trowulan have shown that parts of the old settlement still lie buried under several metres of mud and volcanic debris, a result of the frequent eruptions of nearby Mount Kelud, as well as frequent flooding of the Brantas River. Several archaeological ruins lie scattered around Trowulan village. Several are quite damaged, while others have undergone reconstruction. Most are constructed of red brick.\n\nCandi Tikus is a ritual bathing pool (\"petirtaan\") which is perhaps the most exciting recent archaeological finding at Trowulan. Candi Tikus means 'rat temple', the name given to the discovery in 1914 because the site appeared during the excavation to be a rat-breeding enclosure. Restored to its present condition in 1985 and 1989, this complex of red brick takes the form of a sunken, rectangular basin, into which a flight of steps descends on the northern side. The principal structure, which projects from the southern wall of the basin, was apparently modelled on the legendary Mount Mahameru. No longer complete, it consisted of terraced foundations, upon which would have rested a concentric arrangement of 'turrets' surrounding the highest peak of the building.\n\nNot far from Candi Tikus in the Keraton hamlet stands the recently restored gateway of Bajang Ratu, an elegant red brick paduraksa gate dating from the mid-14th century. The form of the structure is tall and slender, rising to a height of 16.5 metres and displaying intricate relief decoration, especially on the roof section. The gate is adorned with a bas reliefs depicting the story of Sri Tanjung and Ramayana. \"Bajang Ratu\" in Javanese literally means 'dwarf or defect monarch'. Folk tradition links the gate with Jayanegara, the second Majapahit king, successor to Kertarajasa Jayawarddhana, founder of the Majapahit Empire. According to tradition, Jayanegara fell from the gate as a child, causing defects to his body. The name probably also means 'little monarch', as Jayanegara ascended to the throne at a young age. Historian connect this gate with Çrenggapura (Çri Ranggapura) or Kapopongan of Antawulan (Trowulan), the shrine mentioned in Nagarakertagama as the dharma place (holy compound) dedicated to King Jayanegara during his death on 1328.\n\nWringin Lawang is located a short distance south of Indonesian National Route 15 at Jatipasar village. The name in Javanese means 'The Banyan Tree Gate'. The grand gate portals are made from red brick, with a base of 13 x 11 metres and a height of 15.5 metres, and date from the 14th century. The gate is of the 'candi bentar' or split gateway type, a structure which may have appeared during the Majapahit era. It is one of the oldest and the largest surviving 'Candi Bentar' dated from Majapahit era. The 'Candi Bentar' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure – consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof – evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the center for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound. Most historians agree that this structure is the gate of an important compound in the Majapahit capital. Speculations concerning the original function of this majestic gateway have led to various suggestions, a popular one being that it was the entrance to the residence of Gajah Mada.\n\nCandi Brahu in the Bejijong village is the sole surviving structure of what was once a cluster of historic buildings. According to popular folk belief, it was in the vicinity of Candi Brahu that the cremation ceremonies for the first four Majapahit rulers were carried out. This tradition, while difficult to prove, is supported in part by material evidence, which suggests that the monument once served as a royal mortuary shrine. The royal personage to whom the building was dedicated remains unclear. The ruin of Candi Gentong lies nearby.\n\nThe Islamic tomb of Champa Princess is believed to be the tomb of a Majapahit king's consort. According to local traditions, she is said to have married one of the last of the Majapahit kings and to have converted him to Islam before her death in 1448.\n\nSegaran Pool is a large rectangular pool 800 x 500 metres in size. The name Segaran originated from the word 'segara' in Javanese which means 'sea', probably based on the local suggestion that the large pool is the miniature of the sea. Surrounding the water basin is a rectangular wall made of red brick. The brick pool structure was discovered in 1926 by Henri Maclaine Pont; at that time the pool was covered in dirt and mud. Reconstruction took place some years later and now Segaran pool functions as a recreational pool and fishing pond. The brick structure originated from the 14th–15th century Majapahit era. The actual function of the pool is unknown. A study suggested that the pool probably served various functions, but mainly as the city reservoir, the source of fresh water essential for high density urban area, especially during the dry season. Another popular local belief is that the pool was used as the bathing place and as a swimming pool to train Majapahit troops, and as recreational pool for Majapahit royalty to entertain envoys and guests. The 46,875-square meter pool was built slightly higher than its surroundings and is currently used to irrigate paddy fields adjacent to the pool.\n\nNear northeast edge of Kolam Segaran lies the ruin of Candi Menak Jingga. The structure is now ruined and stones scattered around the vicinity with the base still lies buried underground. Excavation still on the progress. The structure is made from carved andesite stone on outer layer with red brick in inner layer. The most exciting feature of this structure is the parts contained ornaments (probably roof part) identified as Qilin, a Chinese mythical creature. This might suggested a strong cultural relationship with China especially during Ming Dynasty. The local tradition linked this site with the pavilion of Queen Kencana Wungu, the Majapahit queen from the tales of Damarwulan and Menak Jingga.\n\nAt Umpak, stones form the base for wooden pillars, which were probably part of wooden building. The organic material has decayed and only the stone base remains.\n\nIn the Troloyo hamlet, numerous Islamic tombstones have been discovered, the majority of which date from between 1350 and 1478. These finds confirm not only that a Muslim community was well established in Java by the mid 14th century, but also that the religion was officially acknowledged and practised within the royal capital itself. People believe that Troloyo also contains the tomb of Raden Wijaya, and they use to make a pilgrim every \"Legi\" Friday.\n\nOther important ruins include:\n\nArchaeological excavations have revealed brick floors and the walls of some dwellings. In some cases, two or even three layers of such buildings are superimposed. These dwellings were equipped with wells and drains. Traces of a large reservoir and wells lined with brick or clay have also been located.\n\nMany pieces of gold jewelry from this period have been discovered in east Java. Although Java lacks significant gold resources, imports from Sumatra, Borneo, and Sulawesi made it possible for many goldsmiths to find work in Java.\n\nOne hamlet of Trowulan is still called Kemasan, from the word \"mas\", meaning 'gold'. Gold ornaments have been discovered near this area, as well as the tools that were used for working the gold. Small clay cups might have been used for melting gold for use in lost wax casting. Bronze anvils and flat circular stones with three legs may have been used as work surfaces for chiselling and hammering metals. A large number of clay crucibles for melting bronze have been excavated at Pakis village, in the southern part of the site. Some of the bronze was used to cast \"uang gobog\", large coins or amulets, in stone moulds. Other metal objects include ornate bronze lamps, water containers, bells and other items probably used in religious ceremonies, and instruments usually called 'slit drums'. Similar objects made of wood or bamboo are still found in Javanese and Balinese villages. Many iron tools were used, but most were probably imported, as Java has little iron ore.\n\nThe \"Nawanatya\" mentions a court official whose duty was to protect the markets. 'Eight thousands cash every day from the markets is the share' received by this official. The 'cash' referred to in this text is Chinese bronze coins which became Majapahit's official currency in around 1300, replacing gold and silver currency which had been in use for centuries. Chinese coins were apparently preferable because they were available in small denominations, suitable for use in markets. This change suggests that economic life in Trowulan was marked by specialized occupations, wages, and the acquisition of most daily needs by purchase. Important evidence for the 14th-century Javanese perception of money comes in the form of clay piggy banks with slits in their backs large enough to admit a coin. The association of pig figurines and containers for saving money is obvious; in present Javanese and Indonesian, the word 'celengan' means 'piggy bank', 'money box', or 'saving', while the root word 'celeng' itself means boar or pig. Coin containers in other shapes have also been found.\n\nSignificant numbers of Majapahit Terracotta artifacts were commonly discovered in Trowulan. The craft of pottery was an important activity. Most pottery was intended for domestic use in cooking and storage, with decorations limited to stripes of red paint. Lamps for coconut oil are another common find. The finest pottery takes the form of vessels, such as water ewers (\"kendi\"), with thin-walled bodies, graceful shapes, and a glossy red surface created by burnishing. These must have been made by full-time professional potters. Water containers were one of the Majapahit urban potter's main products and many large round water jars have been found. Square water 'boxes' were decorated with aquatic motifs or other scenery. Terracotta figurines were produced in large quantities, representing many subjects: gods, humans, animals, buildings, and scenes. Their function is unknown; they may have served multiple purposes. Some may have been used in religious shrines attached to dwellings, as in modern Bali. Examples of these terracottas in the form of miniature buildings and animals have been found at shrines on Mount Penanggungan. Others, such as humorous depictions of foreigners, may simply have been meant as toys for children.\n\nDuring the last half-year of 2008, the Indonesian government sponsored a massive exploration on the site that is believed to be the place where the palace of Majapahit once stood. Jero Wacik, the Indonesian Minister of Culture and Tourism stated that the Majapahit Park would be built on the site and completed as early as 2009, in order to prevent further damage caused by home-made brick industries that develop on the surrounding area.\nThe Majapahit Park would expand the existing Trowulan Museum and provide a Majapahit themed education and recreation park.\n\nNevertheless, the project leaves a huge attention to some historians, since constructing the park's foundation in Segaran site located in south side of Trowulan Museum will inevitably damage the site itself. Ancient bricks and wells which are historically valuable were found scattered on the site. The government then argued that the method they were applying were less destructive since digging method were used instead of drilling. Since then the construction of Majapahit Park has been halted, postponed for further study of the impact on the archaeological site.\n\n\n\n"}
