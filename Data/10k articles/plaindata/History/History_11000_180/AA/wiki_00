{"id": "99435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99435", "title": "Agatharchides", "text": "Agatharchides\n\nAgatharchides or Agatharchus ( or , \"Agatharchos\") of Cnidus was a Greek historian and geographer (flourished 2nd century BC).\n\nAgatharchides is believed to have been born at Cnidus, hence his appellation. As Stanley M. Burstein notes, the \"evidence for Agatharchides' life is meagre.\" Photius describes him as a \"threptos\", a kind of assistant of servile origin, to Cinnaeus and states that he was later a secretary to Heraclides Lembus. Cinnaeus served as a counselor to Ptolemy VI; Heraclides is best known for negotiating the treaty that ended Antiochus IV's invasion of Egypt in 169 BC.\n\nAgatharchides furnishes few clues about his own life. At the conclusion of his \"On the Erythraean Sea\", he apologizes for being unable to complete his work \"since our age is unable to similarly bear the toil\" and \"as a result of the disturbances in Egypt\" he could no longer access the official records (a fragment cited by Photius in his \"Bibliotheca\" Cod. 250.110, 460b). There are two possible occasions when this could have happened: the first was in 145 BC, when Ptolemy VIII purged Alexandria of the intellectuals who supported his rivals for the throne; and in 132 BC after Ptolemy, who had been driven from his kingdom by a rebellion in Alexandria, returned and exacted reprisals on that city. While most scholars have favored the later date, Burstein argues for the earlier one.\n\nExtracts from the first book of his \"Erythraean Sea\", written in the first person and advocating a military campaign into the lands south of Egypt, led early scholars to deduce that Agatharchides was an important political figure of his time, and served as a guardian to one of the sons of Ptolemy VIII. Dodwell endeavored to show that it the younger son, Alexander, and objects to Soter, that he reigned conjointly with his mother. This, however, was the case with Alexander likewise. Wesseling and Henry Fynes Clinton think the elder brother to be the one meant, for Soter was more likely to have been a minor on his accession in 117 BC than Alexander in 107 BC, ten years after their father's death; the second edition of the \"Oxford Classical Dictionary\" article on Agatharchides agrees that the son was Soter. Moreover, Dodwell's date would leave too short an interval between the publication of Agatharchides's work on the Erythraean Sea (about 113 BC), and the work of Artemidorus. However at least as early as 1810, when B. G. Niebuhr pointed out that these excerpts were from a speech, and not part of the narrative of his book, this theory has been recognized as conflicting with other known historical facts.\n\nAgatharchides was not well known in ancient times. Of his two major works, \"Affairs in Asia\" (\"Ta kata ten Asian\") in ten books, and \"Affairs in Europe\" (\"Ta kata ten Europen\") in forty-nine books, only a few fragments survive, too few to provide us with any sense of the contents of either work. However, for his \"On the Erythraean Sea\" (\"Peri tes Erythras thalasses\") in five books, almost the entire fifth book, a geographical treatise on the Horn of Africa and the lands around the Red Sea, has survived almost intact. According to Burstein, \"the comparative soberness of Agatharchides' treatment compared to previous accounts and the wealth of information contained in it led to a quick recognition . . . [that it was] a valuable summary of the results of Ptolemaic exploration.\"\n\nIn the first book of \"On the Erythraean Sea\" was a discussion respecting the origin of the name. In the fifth Agatharchides described the mode of life amongst the Sabaeans in Arabia, and the Ichthyophagi, or fish-eaters, the way in which elephants were caught by the elephant-eaters, and the mode of working the gold mines in the mountains of Egypt, near the Red Sea. His account of the Ichthyophagi and of the mode of working the gold mines, has been copied by Diodorus (iii.12-18). Amongst other extraordinary animals he mentions the camelopard, which was found in the country of the Troglodytae, and the rhinoceros.\n\nMaterial from this book is quoted directly or indirectly by Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Pliny the Elder, Aelian (Claudius Aelianus), Josephus and other authors. Although Agatharchides' work was superseded by more detailed accounts in the 2nd century AD, Photius found a copy of \"Erythraean Sea\" in the 10th century, from which he preserved extensive extracts in his \"Bibliotheca\". Photius states that Agatharchides wrote in the Attic dialect, with a style that was dignified and perspicuous, and abounded in sententious passages—inspiring a favorable opinion from Photius. In the composition of his speeches Agatharchides was an imitator of Thucydides, whom he equalled in dignity and excelled in clearness. He was acquainted with the language of the Aethiopians (\"de Rubr. M.\" p. 46), and appears to have been the first who discovered the true cause of the yearly inundations of the Nile. (Diod. i. 41.)\n\nAn Agatharchides, of Samos, is mentioned by Plutarch, as the author of a work on Persia, and one περὶ λίθων. J.A. Fabricius, however, conjectures that the true reading is Agathyrsides, not Agatharchides. (Dodwell in Hudson's \"Geogr. Script. Gr. Minores\"; Clinton, \"Fasti Hell.\" iii, p. 535.)\n\nThe crater Agatharchides on the Moon is named in his honour.\n\n\n"}

In 1989 Klyosov immigrated to the US. He spent most of his career developing ways to use enzymes to convert agricultural waste products into useful products — first to convert cotton waste to glucose in the USSR, and later in the US, turning paper mill waste into useful products. He later helped found a company, and later joined it as CSO, that was founded to use enzymes to alter existing anticancer drugs via glycosylation. In 2008 he began publishing work about what he calls \"DNA genealogy\" that has been dismissed as pseudoscience.\n\nKlyosov earned Ph.D. and D.Sc. degrees in physical chemistry, and an M.S. degree in enzyme kinetics, from Moscow State University. In the late 1970s he worked at Harvard University; he was offered a contract to keep working there but the USSR government would not allow him to take it and he remained in the USSR. From 1979 to 1981 he was professor in the department of chemical enzymology at Moscow State University.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1990, he was professor and head of the Carbohydrates Research Laboratory at the A.N. Bach Institute of Biochemistry, USSR Academy of Sciences. In the winter of 1982/1983 he became the first person behind the Iron Curtain who was allowed by the government of the USSR to use the computer network that later became the Internet, in order for him to represent the USSR in a conference hosted on the network; he used a computer hosted on Institute's network. He said that he developed methods to use enzymes to convert cotton plant waste products into glucose and by 1983 a pilot plant had been built in the USSR to test these methods. He was awarded top Russian prizes in science and technology field: the Lenin Komsomol Prize in 1978 and the USSR State Prize in 1984. In 1989 he was made a fellow of the World Academy of Art and Science. In 2014 he became Foreign Member of the National Academy of Sciences of Georgia.\n\nKlyosov immigrated to the US in 1989 after Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, and from 1990 to 1998 he was a visiting professor of biochemistry at the Center for Biochemical and Biophysical Sciences at Harvard Medical School.\n\nIn 1991 he started a consulting business called MIR International.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2006 Klyosov worked at a subsidiary of Kadant, where he applied enzymology to processing of waste products from the paper-making industry, and following advice from a friend in the plastics industry, helped create a business that used cellulose granules as filler material for plastic composite products.\n\nIn 2001 he helped found Pro-Pharmaceuticals, a company that was formed to use enzymes to add carbodydrates to existing cancer drugs to make them work better, and was caught up in scandal in 2004 when the company's investors accused its CEO of misrepresenting his role in the company. He joined the company as Chief Scientific Officer in 2006. Pro-Pharmaceuticals named a new CEO in March 2011, and gave Klyosov a one-year contract to continue as CSO the same month.

Thomas Henry Haddan was his brother. He received his early education at a private school kept by a Mr. Fanning at Finchley. In 1834 he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, as a commoner, and in the November of that year stood unsuccessfully for a scholarship at Balliol College, but was elected scholar of Trinity College, Oxford. 15 June 1835. He graduated B.A. in 1837, obtaining a first-class in classics and a second in mathematics, proceeded M.A. in due course, and took the degree of B.D.\n\nAfter graduating he applied himself to theology, and in 1839 was elected to the university Johnson theological scholarship, and to a fellowship at his college. He was deeply affected by the religious revival at Oxford, and was much influenced by Isaac Williams, then a tutor of Trinity. At Trinity the effect of the tractarian movement was to lead some adherents to the study of history in order, in the first instance, to maintain the historical position and claims of the church. Haddan was a loyal Anglican who defended its apostolic character. Having been ordained deacon on his fellowship in 1840, he acted for about a year as curate of the church of St. Mary the Virgin, Oxford, to John Henry Newman. He was ordained priest in 1842, and on being appointed to succeed Williams as classical tutor of his college, resigned his curacy.\n\nHe was Dean of Trinity College for several years and afterwards vice-president, and was pro-proctor to Henry Peter Guillemard when in 1845 the proctors put their veto on the proceedings against Newman. An austere scholar, for some time after his ordination he was engaged in work for the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology. From the date of its first publication in 1846 he wrote much for \"The Guardian\", the High Church weekly, and he also sent many reviews to the \"Christian Remembrancer\". The judgment on the Gorham case in 1850 troubled him, and for a while he doubted whether he could conscientiously accept a benefice; he found csatisfaction through studying the foundation of the Church of England's claims. Some of the results of his studies on this subject were afterwards embodied in his book on the apostolic succession in the Church of England. In this work, besides stating the nature of the doctrine, its importance, and its scriptural basis, he refuted the Nag's Head fable, which he had already worked on in his edition of John Bramhall's works, concluding the validity of Anglican orders.\n\nIn 1847 Haddan was one of the secretaries of William Ewart Gladstone's election committee, and supported him on the three other occasions when he sought election as a Member of Parliament for the University of Oxford; his support. was because he believed that Gladstone was a fitting representative of the university as a scholar and a churchman. On similar grounds he supported Lord Derby's election as chancellor in 1852. In 1857 he accepted the college living of Barton-on-the-Heath in Warwickshire, and left Oxford to reside there with two sisters. He was appointed Bampton Lecturer in 1863, but was forced to resign the appointment by ill-health. Early in 1869 he brought out, in conjunction with William Stubbs, the first volume of the major work, \"Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents\", founded on the collections of Henry Spelman and David Wilkins. For the contents of this volume he was mainly responsible, and during that and the following year he assisted in the preparation of the third volume; but his health was failing, and the publication of the second volume, which fell to him, was delayed. The part of this volume which is devoted to the early Irish church, and required research into language as well as history, occupied him during his last days. At the same time he was writing articles on church organisation in the first volume of William Smith's \"Dictionary of Christian Antiquities\". He died at Barton-on-the-Heath on 8 February 1873, at the age of fifty-six. He never received any preferment save the living which came to him from his college, and the title of honorary canon of Worcester.\n\nHis published works are:\n\n\nHe also wrote articles and reviews. Many of his shorter writings are collected in \"Remains of A. W.

The film became somewhat famous for its connections to the September 11th terrorist attacks; amongst other things, it was the last major production to film inside the former World Trade Center. The film plot, written years before the attacks, involved a variety of Serbo-Balkan extremists (including a man from Afghanistan) planning a huge attack in New York City. The movie's release date was moved out of its late 2001 spot and into a summer 2002 release, similar to several other films with terrorism or violent crime-related stories, including \"Collateral Damage\" and \"Training Day\".\n\nWhen a mission to retrieve a stolen suitcase bomb goes bad, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent Kevin Pope (Rock) is killed. Pope was working undercover as an antiquities dealer under the name Michael Turner. The CIA, which is desperate to complete the mission, discovers that Agent Pope had a twin brother, Jake Hayes (also Rock), from whom he was separated at birth; their mother died giving birth and Hayes suffered from a severe lung infection that prompted the doctors to separate them because they felt that Hayes was unlikely to live for very long. Hayes hustles chess games, scalps tickets and works at small clubs in Jersey City, New Jersey to make ends meet. Meanwhile, Hayes's girlfriend, Julie (Kerry Washington) grows tired of waiting for him to grow up and decides to move to Seattle, Washington.\n\nAfter the CIA successfully persuades Hayes to participate and begins to train Hayes for a mission that is to take place in Prague, Czech Republic, they are initially dismayed by his lack of refinement. Agent Oakes (Hopkins) confronts Hayes, telling him he doesn't trust him. When Hayes begins paying attention, the CIA sets him up in his brother's old apartment in Manhattan to test him and try to bait the men who killed his brother. Hayes is attacked, but escapes unharmed. Looking for a way out, Hayes goes to his foster mother only to be found by Oakes, who persuades him to finish the mission.\n\nAfter arriving in Prague, Hayes - posing as his dead brother - meets with the men selling the suitcase bomb. The seller, Adrik Vas, is an ex-Russian Army Colonel with ties to the Russian Mafia. When they return to their hotel, Hayes is greeted by his brother's ex-girlfriend Nicole (Garcelle Beauvais). Believing Hayes is his brother, she dines with him and returns to his hotel, where the couple is ambushed by rival buyers. Nicole figures out that Hayes isn't his brother and returns to her assignment covering the Balkans for CNN.\n\nMoving forward with the plans, Hayes and Oakes meet up with Vas and are able to steal the arming codes. Just as they close the deal, Vas' men double cross them with the rival buyer. When the rival dealers, who are part of a multi-national terrorist organization, learn they can't detonate the bomb because of the missing codes, they kidnap Julie. Hayes gives himself up trying to save his girlfriend, and the terrorists get the codes back and arm the bomb.\n\nNow the race begins to find Hayes and the bomb. After interrogating one of the captured terrorists, they track the bomb to Grand Central Station. With the clock ticking, they locate the bomb and the terrorist leader Dragan Adjanic (Matthew Marsh), who has started the countdown. Oakes rescues Hayes by killing two terrorists. As Hayes starts to enter the codes to disarm the bomb, Adjanic holds Julie hostage. In order to distract Adjanic, Hayes pretends to shoot Oakes, and they kill Adjanic by shooting him repeatedly. Hayes is able to disarm the bomb just prior to detonation.\n\nAt the ending of the film, Hayes visits the memorial for deceased secret agents to visit his brother's grave. Later on, Oakes comes up to Hayes at Hayes's wedding and warns him that a dangerous criminal has escaped from prison and is seeking revenge upon Kevin Pope, but since Kevin is dead and Hayes was impersonating him, the criminal thinks Hayes is Kevin. Hayes begins to panic and demand that Oakes has to protect him, but Oakes starts laughing as he reveals that it was just a joke and he really just came for the wedding and also giving him a honey moon trip as a wedding gift.\n\n\n\"Bad Company\" failed to recoup its budget at the box office, earning only $30,160,161 in the United States and $35,817,134 outside the US for a worldwide total of $65,977,295. The film was originally slated to be released in December 2001 but because of the attacks of September 11, 2001, the film's release was postponed given the fact the film was about a terrorist attack on New York City.\n\nThe film was panned by critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 10% based on 133 reviews; the site's critical consensus stated [that both] \"Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins fail to generate the sparks necessary to save the movie from a generic and utterly predictable script.\"\n\n\"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" reviewer William Arnold calls the film \"wildly overproduced, inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one (and no one).\" Roger Ebert remarks in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" that the film \"jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time.\" On their review show, Ebert and Richard Roeper gave it two thumbs down, arguing that it \"might have been considered original, had it been made [set] before \"48 Hrs.\", \"Lethal Weapon\" and \"Rush Hour\" and every other action movie about a racially mixed pair of partners who initially despise each other, but learn to, well, you know the whole drill.\"\n\nDavid Hunter of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted the film as having \"all the familiar Bruckheimer elements, and Schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the Hopkins/Rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas.\"\n\nA soundtrack containing hip hop, alternative and R&B music was released on June 4, 2002 by Hollywood Records. It peaked at number 98 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 11 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.\n\n\"Bad Company\" was partially filmed in Prague, Czech Republic.

A hand appears and writes on the wall. The terrified Belshazzar calls for his wise men, but they are unable to read the writing. The queen advises him to send for Daniel, renowned for his wisdom. Daniel reminds Belshazzar that his father Nebuchadnezzar, when he became arrogant, was thrown down until he learned that God has sovereignty over the kingdom of men. Belshazzar had likewise blasphemed God, and so God sent this hand. Daniel then reads the message and interprets it: God has numbered Belshazzar's days, he has been weighed and found wanting, and his kingdom will be given to the Medes and the Persians.\nThe message of Daniel 5 is the contrast it offers between Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar:\n\nBelshazzar's feast is a legend conforming to the subgenre of the \"tale of court contest,\" complicated by the inclusion of Daniel's indictment of Belshazzar's pride and his failure to honour the God of Israel; as a result the tale has a double ending, in which Daniel is first showered with rewards and honours for interpreting the omen, and the king is then punished to fulfill the sentence pronounced by Daniel.\n\n\"This summarizes the narrative, as found in C. L. Seow's translation of the text in his commentary on Daniel.\"\n\nKing Belshazzar holds a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and commands that the Temple vessels from Jerusalem be brought in so that they can drink from them, but as the Babylonians drink, a hand appears and writes on the wall. Belshazzar calls for his magicians and diviners to interpret the writing, but they are unable even to read them. The queen advises Belshazzar to send for Daniel, renowned for his wisdom. Daniel is brought in, and the king offers to make him third in rank in the kingdom if he can interpret the writing. Daniel declines the honour, but agrees to the request. He reminds Belshazzar that Nebuchadnezzar's greatness was the gift of God, and that when he became arrogant God threw him down until he learned humility: \"the Most High God has sovereignty over the kingdom of mortals, and sets over it whomever He will.\" Belshazzar has drunk from the vessels of God's Temple and praised his idols, but he has not given honour to God, and so God sent this hand and wrote these words:\n\nDaniel reads the words \"MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN\" and interprets them for the king: \"MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; TEKEL, you have been weighed ... and found wanting;\" and \"PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians. Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed in purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made… that he should rank third in the kingdom; [and] that very night Belshazzar the Chaldean (Babylonian) king was killed, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom.\"\n\nThe Chaldean wise men are unable to read the writing on the wall, let alone interpret it, but Daniel does so by supplying vowels in two different ways, first so the words are read as nouns, then as verbs. The nouns are monetary weights: a \"mənê\", equivalent to a Jewish mina or sixty shekels (several ancient versions have only one \"mənê\" instead of two), a \"təqêl\", equivalent to a shekel, and \"p̄arsîn\", meaning \"half-pieces\". The last involves a word-play on the name of the Persians (\"pārās\" in Hebrew), suggesting not only that they are to inherit Belshazzar's kingdom, but that they are two peoples, Medes and Persians. Daniel then interprets the words as verbs, based on their roots: \"mənê\" is interpreted as meaning \"numbered\", \"təqêl\", from a root meaning to weigh, as meaning \"weighed\" (and found wanting), and \"pərês\" (), the singular form of \"p̄arsîn\", from a root meaning \"to divide\", denoting that the kingdom is to be \"divided\" and given to the Medes and Persians. If the \"half-pieces\" means two half-shekels, then the various weights—a \"mənê\" or sixty shekels, another shekel, and two half-shekels—add up to 62, which the tale gives as the age of Darius the Mede, indicating that God's will is being worked out.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the Book of Daniel originated as a collection of folktales among the Jewish community in Babylon in the Persian and early Hellenistic periods (5th to 3rd centuries BC), and was later expanded in the Maccabean era (mid-2nd century) with the visions of chapters 7–12. Modern scholarship agrees that Daniel is a legendary figure, and it is possible that his name was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition.\n\nChapters 2–7 of the book form a chiasm (a poetic structure in which the main point or message of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by further repetitions on either side):\n\nDaniel 5 is thus composed as a companion-piece to Daniel 4, the tale of the madness of Nebuchadnezzar, the two giving variations on a single theme. This is spelled out in chapter 5 when Daniel draws a direct parallel between the two kings: the fate of Belshazzar illustrates what happens when a king does not repent.\n\nDaniel 5 does not divide neatly into scenes and scholars do not agree on its structure. The following is one possible outline:\n\nThe story is set around the fall of Babylon, when on 12 October 539 BCE the Persian conqueror Cyrus the Great entered the city. Its last king, Nabonidus, was captured, and his fate is unknown, although he may have been exiled. Several details in the text do not match the known historical facts. Belshazzar is portrayed as king of Babylon and son of Nebuchadnezzar, but was actually the son of King Nabonidus, one of Nebuchadnezzar's successors, and never became king. The conqueror is named as Darius the Mede, but no such individual is known to history; and the invaders were not Medes, but Persians. This is typical of the story's genre, in which historical accuracy is not an essential element.\n\nThe constituent elements of the Book of Daniel were assembled shortly after the end of the Maccabean crisis, which is to say shortly after 164 BCE. The tales making up chapters 2 to 6 are the earliest part, dating from the late 4th or early 3rd centuries. Their setting is Babylon, and there is no reason to doubt that they were composed in the Babylonian diaspora (i.e., among the Jewish community living in Babylon and Mesopotamia under Persian and then Greek rule). They reflect a society in which foreign rulers were not necessarily malevolent (Belshazzar rewards Daniel and raises him to high office); this is a marked contrast with the visions of chapters 7–12, where the sufferings of the Jews are the result of actions by the evil 2nd century BCE king Antiochus IV Epiphanes.\n\nChapters 2 and 7 tell how all worldly kingdoms will come to an end and be replaced by the kingdom of God, and chapters 3 and 6 tell how pious Jews withstand the arrogance of earthly kings and are rescued by the God of Israel. Chapters 4 and 5 form the center and carry the most important message in their parallel but contrasting tales of Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar. The first is humbled by God, learns his lesson (he acknowledges the ultimate kingship of the Jewish God), and is restored to his throne; Belshazzar, in contrast, learns nothing from Nebuchadnezzar's example, blasphemes against God, and has his kingdom given to others.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

His work combined many strands of both political and aesthetic discourse into his writings, addressing both the developing aesthetic of modern art and the political situation in Europe.\n\nEinstein's involvement in social and political life was characterized by communist sympathies and anarchist views. A target of the German right wing during the interwar Weimar period, Einstein left Germany for France in 1928, a half-decade ahead of the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, later taking part in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the anti-Francisco Franco anarcho-syndicalists during the 1930s.\n\nTrapped in southern France following Nazi Germany's defeat of the French Third Republic, Einstein took his own life by jumping from a bridge on 5 July 1940.\n\nCarl Einstein who was born to a German Jewish family on 26 April 1885, in the Rhineland town of Neuwied. The second child born to Daniel Einstein, an active member of the local Jewish community, and Sophie Einstein, Carl was a year younger than his sister Hedwig, who would become known as a concert pianist and the wife of sculptor Benno Elkan. A third child born to Daniel and Sophie died in 1889. The young Carl Einstein spent much of his youth in Karlsruhe before moving to Berlin to study philosophy and art history in 1903. Originally given the standard German spelling of his first name as \"Karl\" at birth, he adopted the Latinized spelling \"Carl\" in the 1900s. In Berlin he attended the lectures of Georg Simmel and Heinrich Wölfflin but lacking a high school diploma (Abitur) he could not gain a doctorate. In 1907 he visited Paris and learnt of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Juan Gris, as well as other artists. Upon his return he started writing prose and joined the radical circle around Franz Pfemfert and his magazine \"Die Aktion\". This led to the publication of \"Bebuquin oder die Dilettanten des Wunders\" in serialised form in \"Die Aktion\" in 1912, with an subsequent volume collecting the episodes in a single book. In 1913 he married Maria Ramm, sister of Alexandra Ramm-Pfemfert and so becoming Franz's brother in law.\n\nEinstein welcomed the outbreak of war and volunteered for the Imperial German Army. served as a soldier of Imperial Germany in World War I. The majority of his wartime service was spent in German-occupied Belgium. The work carried out by German scholars on Congolese art during the occupation would prove to be considerably helpful in Einstein's later efforts to encourage the beginning of a serious appreciation of black African art by Europeans.\n\nEinstein’s life after the First World War was marked by the violent political and social implications of the war and revolutionary sentiment following the Hohenzollern monarchy's collapse. He was actively involved in the short-lived Revolutionary Brussels Soldiers' Council and to a lesser extent in the failed Spartacist Uprising in Berlin and later in the defeated anarchist Durruti Column during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nAlbert Einstein was offered a part-time professorship at Leiden University in 1920. Hendrik Lorentz, one of the people who organised the offer saw it as way of promoting international reconciliation following the First World War. However, when the proposed appointment was passed to the government bureaucracy for approval as University professors were regarded as senior civil servants who required royal approval. However, a Dutch military intelligence report was submitted to the Minister of Education Johannes Theodoor de Visser, which gave an account of Carl Einstein's activities in the 1918 Soldiers' Council in Belgium. This caused delays in governmental approval for the appointment. This was accompanied by a number of accounts of Carl's agitational activity during the German Revolution, including Carl's graveside oration after the murder of Rosa Luxemburg, which frequently omitted his first name. It is possible that this confusion led Paul Weyland to coin the phrase \"scientific Dadaism\". Indeed, Hannah Höch featured the inclusion of the image of Albert Einstein in her collage \"Schnitt mit dem Küchenmesser. Dada durch die letzte weimarer Bierbauchkulturepoche Deutschlands\", which was exhibited in the first International Dada Fair, held in Berlin in 1920.\n\nEinstein established a reputation as a well-known author and art critic on the basis of work ranging from his debut novel \"Bebuquin oder die Dilettanten des Wunders\", to his widely read work on African sculpture \"Negerplastik\" (\"Negro Sculpture\"), credited as being one of the first important books acknowledging African art in Europe (and especially its relationship to Cubism), the final volume of the prestigious Propyläen Verlag history of art series \"Die Kunst des 20. Jahrhunderts\" (\"Art of the 20th Century\"), which may have gained him an invitation to teach at the Bauhaus (he declined), to the notorious play \"Die Schlimme Botschaft\". Another Africa-related book is \"Afrikanische Märchen und Legenden\", a compilation of African mythology in very expressive language. Einstein also worked on numerous journals and collective projects, among some of the more important: \"Die Aktion\" edited by Franz Pfemfert, \"Die Pleite\" and \"Der Blutige Ernst\" with George Grosz, and the legendary journal \"Documents: Doctrines, Archéologie, Beaux-arts, Ethnographie\" edited with Georges Bataille.\n\nEinstein's avant-garde orientation and leftist political sympathies made him a marked man for right-wing attacks during the Weimar Republic. His passion play \"Die Schlimme Botschaft\" (\"The Sad Tidings\", or \"The Bad News\") was met with attacks as blasphemous; its 1921 publication resulted in a legal process and a conviction for blasphemy in 1922, and Einstein was forced to atone for the revolutionary ideas placed into the mouth of his Jesus Christ with a 15,000-mark fine.\n\nBetter received in France, Einstein left Germany for permanent residence in France in 1928; with Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the exile became permanent and officially mandated. Having met Lyda Guévrékian in 1928, Einstein married her in 1932. The French Cubist painter and sculptor, Georges Braque, served as a witness.\n\nEinstein spent 1936-1938 fighting in the Spanish Civil War; returning to France where in 1940, he was arrested and interned along with the other German émigrés until his liberation later in the spring of 1940 as a result of chaotic circumstances in the face of the rapidly progressing German invasion. Although able to escape the German occupation of Paris during the Fall of France and flee to the south, he was left trapped on the French border with Franco’s Spain.\n\nBereft of alternatives, Einstein committed suicide in the Pyrenees town of Lestelle-Betharram on 5 July 1940.\n\nIn 1919 he worked with George Grosz on \"Die blutige Ernst\" (The Bloody Ernst) published by Trianon Verlag, Berlin\n\n\n\n"}

Conservators possess the expertise to preserve cultural heritage in a way that retains the integrity of the object, building or site, including its historical significance, context and aesthetic or visual aspects. This kind of preservation is done by analyzing and assessing the condition of cultural property, understanding processes and evidence of deterioration, planning collections care or site management strategies that prevent damage, carrying out conservation treatments, and conducting research. A conservator's job is to ensure that the objects in a museum's collection are kept in the best possible condition, as well as to serve the museum's mission to bring art before the public.\n\nEssentially, the term \"conservation\" refers to a manner of care or treatment that repairs damage and also takes action to prevent or slow down further deterioration of an object. The term \"restoration\" refers to a manner of care or treatment in which the goal is to bring an object back to its original appearance or function. \"Restoration\" can be part of the care and treatment of an object and is a subset of the umbrella term \"conservation\". Both terms come into play when it comes to the treatment and care of all cultural heritage.\n\nConservators and restorers care for, manage, treat, preserve, and document many different historical items including artifacts, art, and specimens.\n\n\n\nConservators can receive training through apprenticeships, internships and graduate programs. In order to be accepted into a graduate program, they will need to fulfill some undergraduate prerequisites. This includes undergraduate coursework in science, the humanities (art history, anthropology, and archaeology), and studio art. Some graduate programs may also require internship, volunteer, apprenticeship, or paid conservation experience. Many may also require a personal interview where candidates are asked to present a portfolio of art and conservation project work that demonstrates manual dexterity and familiarity with techniques and materials. Graduate programs generally require two to four years of study, which can also include a full-time internship in the final year where students work under the guidance of experienced conservators. There are also a limited number of Ph.D. programs for advanced study in conservation. Conservation-related programs are described on the websites of the AIC, the National Council for Preservation Education (NCPE)], and the Society of American Archivists (SAA).\n\nPost-graduate fellowships have also been cited as valuable experiences in their professional development. These fellowships provide intensive research, practice, and exposure to diverse professional staff or significant collections. A few institutions that offer fellowships include the Getty Foundation, the Smithsonian's Museum Conservation Institute, and the Straus Center of Harvard Art Museums.\n\nThe specialty of conservation is ever-changing and evolving, which means that practicing conservators must stay up-to-date of advances in technology and methodology. Conservators usually expand their knowledge through reading publications, attending professional meetings, and enrolling in short-term workshops or courses. AIC offers many workshops, conferences, and online courses and tutorials. Conservation OnLine (CoOL) also offers resources for conservation professionals.\n\nSome conservators specialize in a particular material or group of objects, such as archaeology, ceramics and glass, furniture and wood, gilding and decorative surfaces, historic interiors, metals, paintings, paper and books, photographic materials, stained glass, stone and wall paintings, textiles, sculptures, and architecture.\n\n\nThe primary goal for conservators and restorers is the preservation of cultural property. In order to achieve this goal, conservators abide by a code of ethics and guidelines that establish the principles that guide conservation professionals and others who are involved in the care of cultural property. An example of a code of ethics and guidelines for practice were created by the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). One of the most important principles in a conservator's code of ethics is that treatments should be reversible, which means that one must be able to undo any treatment in the future. Conservators strive to only minimize interventions and not completely alter an object during restoration. Conservation focuses on the material aspects of art, and respect for original materials remains a crucial element of the field's ethics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3167861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3167861", "title": "Descent from antiquity", "text": "Descent from antiquity\n\nA Descent from Antiquity (DFA or DfA) is a well-researched, historically documented generation-by-generation genealogical descent tracing living persons back to people living in antiquity.\n\nThe idea of descent from antiquity is by no means new to genealogists. Hellenistic dynasties, such as the Ptolemies, claimed descent from gods and legendary heroes. In the Middle Ages, major royal dynasties of Europe sponsored compilations claiming their descent from Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, in particular the rulers of Troy (see also British Israelism, Euhemerism). Such claims were intended as propaganda glorifying a royal patron by trumpeting the antiquity and nobility of his ancestry. These descent lines included not only mythical figures but also stretches of outright fiction, much of which is still widely perpetuated today. The distinguishing feature of a DFA compared to such efforts is the intent to establish an ancestry that is historically accurate and verifiable. Nevertheless, DFA research still focuses on the ancestries of royal and noble families, since the historical record is most complete for such families.\n\nThe phrase \"descent from antiquity\" was used by Tobias Smollett in the 18th-century newspaper \"The Critical Review\". Reviewing William Betham's \"Genealogical Tables of the Sovereigns of the World, from the earliest to the present period\" he wrote \"From a barren list of names we learn who were the fathers or mothers, or more distant progenitors, of the select few, who are able to trace what is called their descent from antiquity.\" The possibility of establishing a DFA as a result of serious genealogical research was raised in a pair of influential essays, by the Albany Herald, Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk, and the late Garter King of Arms, Sir Anthony Wagner. Wagner explored the reasons why it was difficult to do, and suggested several possible routes, based on the work of genealogists such as Prince Cyril Toumanoff, Prof. David H. Kelley, Christian Settipani and Ford Mommaerts-Browne. The following years have seen a number of studies of the possibilities. These are highly variable in the quality of their research. Many, if not most, of the DFA-related publications widely used by amateur genealogists are essentially worthless.\n\nNo DFA is accepted as established at this time. However, research has established the outlines of several possible or likely ancestries that could become DFAs. Moreover, the project has stimulated detailed inquiry into the prosopography of ancient and early medieval societies, an effort which is of great value in illuminating the social transformations which took place in those societies.\n\nInnumerable alternative routes of descent from antiquity have been posited.\n\nOne proposal is to establish Charlemagne's descent from one of the senatorial families of the later-day Imperial Rome based in southern Gaul. This project is of particular interest since all European royal families can trace their descent from Charlemagne, as can many other people who are able to trace their descent from European nobility. While such a link possibly existed, extant sources do not permit reconstructing it with any degree of certainty. The record of senatorial families in the 5th and 6th centuries is very sparse. While a large amount of data exists with which to construct a prosopography of the leading provincial families of Imperial Rome in southern Gaul, it is not yet possible to establish a Gallic line that traverses the Imperial Age, though a Roman line through a Gallic one had been proposed in 1991 by Christian Settipani. Therefore, all reconstructions of the DFA through Western European monarchs must remain precarious at best and speculative at worst. Though two possible lines are proposed for the ancestry of Arnulf of Metz, both are linked to the ancestors who are in turn reputedly linked to the Gallo-Roman genealogies. One of these proposes a descent from the proconsul Flavius Afranius Syagrius.\n\nA possible alternative route to Settipani's original scheme goes through the Counts of Coimbra in 9th century Portugal. That route was originally suggested in a discussion between Settipani and Francisco Antonio Doria; it starts with a \"comes\" Ardabastus (born circa 611), son of a Visigoth refugee in Byzantium, Athanagild (in turn son of Saint Hermenegild and Ingunthis) and of Flavia Juliana (a Byzantine noblewoman related to the family of Emperor Maurice), that later moved to Provincia Spaniae (Byzantine possession in Spain) and fathered Erwig, king of the Visigoths (680–687). It is argued that this individual was descended from a Byzantine Artavazd of the great Mamikonian clan. The line is documented in a controversial deed that links the full descent to the historically attested count Hermenegildo Gutiérrez (878). The deed itself is dubious, and while some have suggested that the genealogy it contains could still be authentic, the lack of surviving documentation from the period spanned makes independent evaluation impossible. It is also said that the mentioned Count Ardabastos was a great-nephew of Emperor Maurice, grandson of his brother Peter Augustus, whose ancestry, though Armenian, was of a lower birth. Even if Count Ardabastos was \"only\" a grand-nephew of Emperor Maurice, with no kinship to the Mamikonians, through his maternal grandmother Anastasia Areobinda (wife of Peter Augustus and great-great granddaughter of Flavius Anastasius Paulus Probus Sabinianus Pompeius, Roman consul in 517) he was a lineal descendant of the Valentinian and Theodosian dynasties, as well as of the very ancient gens Anicia, whose first mention dates back to the end of the 4th century BC (Quintus Anicius Praenestinus, curule aedile in 304 BC). If the proposed links between Count Ardabastos and Hermenegildo Guterres are correct, it would be possible to trace a blood-link between Theodosius I or Valentinian I and Ramiro II of León (grandson of Hermenegildo Gutiérrez) and so to the modern European royal houses.\n\nMany genealogists attempted to reconstruct a valid line of descent from Attila the Hun to Charlemagne but no one succeeded in working out a generally accepted route.\n\nSteven Runciman's book on the First Bulgarian Empire, for instance, includes a pedigree of Kubrat from Attila's youngest son, Ernakh, as the Bulgarian khans apparently believed to have been descended from Attila. While no sources are cited and intermediate generations are missing, there is another complication in the Bulgarian route: no documented link between the Bulgarian dynasty and Charlemagne.\n\nChristian Settipani suggested a more plausible descent, although it cannot be reconstructed generation by generation as well. The scholar gives credit to the traditional claim that Attila's daughter was one of many wives of Ardaric, king of the Gepids. It is assumed that the 6th-century Gepid rulers descended from Ardaric and that some royal Gepids claimed descent from this marriage in particular, although details are unclear.\n\nA key link is the documented alliance between a Gepid princess Austrigusa and Waccho, king of the Lombards. According to Settipani, Waccho and Austricusa were ancestors of either Charlemagne's mother or his father, but this claim involves a considerable degree of speculation as well.\n\nAccording to the Pillar of Eliseg, which was erected in Denbighshire, Wales in the 9th century, the 8th-century Welsh King of Powys Elisedd ap Gwylog descended from reputed 5th-century \"King of the Britons\" Vortigern and his wife Sevira, who in turn was the daughter of Western Roman Emperor Magnus Maximus. If the genealogy inscribed in the Pillar of Eliseg is correct, it would be possible to trace a blood-link between Ancient Rome and modern descendants of Medieval Welsh nobility, given that Magnus Maximus's father apparently was part of the gens Julia and that Welsh kings until the Edwardian Conquest of Wales descended from Elisedd ap Gwylog. However, the Pillar of Eliseg's inscription is the only known source for a daughter of Magnus Maximus named \"Sevira\" (or \"Severa\").\n\nThe Solomonic dynasty, formerly sovereign in Ethiopia, has long claimed descent from King Solomon of the Kingdom of Israel. For all of its circumstantial evidence, the well known claim is nonetheless unverifiable due to the fact that reliable documentation is lacking before the 13th century. Outside of this case in particular, similar oral traditions of various descents from antiquity exist in nations and amongst peoples from all over the continent. Amongst the Yorubas of West Africa, for example, there is a popular belief that the numerous members of the tribe are all descendants of Oduduwa, their semi-mythical emperor and founding father, who is believed to have reigned in the 11th century. Contemporary social status in their various kingdoms, therefore, is traditionally reckoned by what can be described as tanistry: If a person can claim to be a \"direct\" descendant of the emperor through the lines of his progeny (i.e. his children and grandchildren) as opposed to being an indirect one through those of his more distant relatives, then he or she is probably a dynastic member of one of the royal or high noble families within the contemporary Yoruba chieftaincy system. As with the aforementioned claim by the Ethiopians, however, genealogical verification is generally difficult in these cases due to an absence of written corroboration.\n\nAnother such case for descent from antiquity originates in the Americas (i.e. pre-Columbian civilization) for the descendants of the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II (himself a direct descendant of the first Aztec king Acamapichtli), among whom can be counted titled members of the Bourbon, Stuart, Habsburg, and Hohenlohe noble houses (as well as untitled people such as Eduardo Matos Moctezuma) and the holders of the titles of Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo, Dukes of Ahumada, Counts of Miravalle, , Condes de la Enjarada, Condes de Alba de Yeltes, Dukes of Atrisco, Dukes of Medinaceli and Dukes of Alba.\n\nMany living Jewish families trace their ancestry to King David through rabbis of the Middle Ages including Rashi and Judah Loew the Maharal of Prague. While there is controversy over the accuracy of some of the lines, complete lines are recorded in books written by Jewish scholars.\n\nSocial privileges and immunities accorded to descendants of Muhammad have led to a vast quantity of false declarations of their lineages. Similar to other parts of the world, claiming noble ancestry helped reinforce a ruler. In the Ottoman Empire, tax breaks for \"the People of the House\" encouraged many people to buy certificates of descent or forge genealogies; the phenomenon of \"teseyyüd\"—falsely claiming noble ancestry—spread across ethnic, class, and religious boundaries. In the 17th century, an Ottoman bureaucrat estimated that there were 300,000 impostors; in 18th-century Anatolia, nearly all upper-class urban people claimed descent from Muhammad. The number of people claiming such ancestry—which exempted them from taxes such as avarız and tekalif-i orfiye—became so great that tax collection was very difficult. The Hashemite kings of Jordan, the Alaouite kings of Morocco, and the Aga Khans, all claim descent from Muhammad or his close relatives.\n\nIn East Asia, a descent from antiquity may be easier to establish. The Japanese imperial family claims descent from the Emperor Ōjin, who is generally considered historical, though his time of life is uncertain. However, contemporary Japanese records do not commence until several centuries after Ōjin's time, and the tradition reports a major change to a cadet line shortly before the start of the literate period.\n\nDue to China's long history of literacy, cultural continuity, and tradition of keeping family records, China has a number of families claiming DFA, including some of the oldest in existence. The following are some examples:\n\nKung Tsui-chang, who succeeded to the title Sacrificial Official to Confucius in the Republic of China in 2009, is claimed to be the 79th-generation male-line descendant of Confucius, and many other Chinese claim descent from this line. Confucius himself was said to be a descendant of the Dukes of Song, who in turn were said to be descendants of the Shang dynasty kings. A 75th-generation descendant of Mencius and a 75th-generation descendant of Zengzi, and a descendant of Yan Hui also have titles of Sacrificial Officials.\n\nIn 2013, a DNA test performed on multiple different families who claimed descent from Confucius found that they shared the same Y chromosome as reported by Fudan University.\n\nIn 1452, Wujing Boshi was bestowed upon the offspring of Mengzi-Meng Xiwen 孟希文 56th generation and Yan Hui-Yan Xihui 顔希惠 59th generation, the same was bestowed on the offspring of Zhou Dunyi-Zhou Mian 週冕 12th generation, the two Cheng brothers (Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi-Chen Keren 程克仁 17th generation), Zhu Xi-Zhu Ting 朱梴 (Zhu Chan?) 9th generation, in 1456-1457, in 1539 the same was awarded to Zeng Can's offspring-Zeng Zhicui 曾質粹 60th generation, in 1622 the offspring of Zhang Zai received the title and in 1630 the offspring of Shao Yong. Zhang Zai's offspring received the appointment as wujing boshi along with Zhu Xi's, Cheng Hao's, Cheng Yi's, and Zhou Dunyi's offspring.\n\nConfucian sages (Disciples of Confucius and Neo Confucian scholars) offspring were granted the office of \"Wujing Boshi\" (五经博士; 五經博士; Wǔjīng Bóshì). There were 22 of them. \"Present Day Political Organization of China\" by V.V. Hagelstrom and H.S. Brunnert contains a list of people who were awarded the title: \"The title of 五經博士 Wu3 Ching1 Po2 Shih4, or simply 博士 Po2 Shih4 (literary designation, 大瀚博 Ta4 Han4 Po2), is also transmitted to the eldest, in a direct line, of the descendants of the following famous men of antiquity : 1. 周公 Chou1 Kung1, 2. 顏淵 Yen2 Yüan1, 3. 曾子輿 Tsêng1 Tzu3-yü2, 4. 閔子騫 Min3 Tzu3-ch'ien1, 5. 仲季路 Chung4 Chi4-lu4, 6. 有子有 Yu3 Tzu3-yu3, 7. 端木子貢 Tuan1 Mu4 Tzu3 Kung4, 8. 卜子夏 Pu3 Tzu3-hsia4, 9. 言子游 Yen2 Tzu3-yu2, 10. 冉伯牛 Jan3 Po2-niu2, 11. 冉仲弓 Jan3 Chung4-kung1, 12. 顓孫子張 Chuan1 Sun1 Tzu3 Chang1, 13. 孟子 Mêng4 Tzu3, 14. 伏生 Fu2 Shêng1, 15. 韓愈 Han4 Yü4, 16. 周敦頤 Chou1 Tun1-i2, 17. 邵雍 Shao4 Yung1, 18. 程顥 Ch'êng2 Hao4, 19. 程頤 Ch'êng2 I2, 20. 張載 Chang 1 Tsai3, 21. 朱熹 Chu1 Hsi3, and 22. 關羽 Kuan1 Yü3.\" It was also granted to the cadet branch of the Confucius family at Quzhou.\n\nZhang Daoling's offspring, The Celestial Masters held the title of 正一嗣教眞人.\n\nLords of the Zhou dynasty claim descent from deified legendary figures in pre-historic era. As such, all families descended from Zhou dynasty rulers can, in turn, trace descent back to gods and heroes in Chinese mythology. This includes the Confucius and Mencius families mentioned above, who both claim traceable descent from the Yellow Emperor. The Five Emperors were asserted as ancestors of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties.\n\nThe modern purported descendants of Cao Cao were authenticated with Y chromosome DNA testing, since the remains of Cao Cao's great-uncle provided Y chromosome O2*-M268 which matched that of the claimed descendants.\n\nThere are numerous families in China who purportedly claim descent from antiquity figures. Some of these lines go back to pre-Qin dynasties, which in turn can be traced back into legendary history.\n\nThe Sui dynasty emperors claimed to be patrilineally descended from the Zhou dynasty kings.\n\nThe Tang dynasty emperors claimed to be patrilineally descended from the ancient philosopher Laozi (whose personal name was Li Dan or Li Er), the Han dynasty General Li Guang, and Western Liang ruler Li Gao. The Yenisei Kirghiz khagans claimed to be descended from Li Ling, who was a grandson of Li Guang, and therefore claimed to be related to the Tang dynasty emperors. This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (隴西李氏) which includes Li Bai.\n\nDescendants of the Tang Emperors live in Chengcun village near the Wuyi mountains in Fujian.\n\nThe Shatuo Later Jin leader Shi Jingtang claimed descent from the Han dynasty chancellor Shi Fen (石奮).\n\nThe Song dynasty chancellor Sima Guang (1019–1086) was descended from the imperial family of the Jin dynasty (265–420).\n\nThe Qing dynasty official Yue Zhongqi (岳鐘琪), who served as the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, was a descendant of the Song dynasty general Yue Fei.\n\nOne of the Duke of Zhou's 72-generation descendants family tree was examined and commented on by Song Lian.\n\nThe Zhikou (Chikow) Chiangs such as Chiang Kai-shek were descended from Chiang Shih-chieh who during the 1600s (17th century) moved there from Fenghua district, whose ancestors in turn came to southeastern China's Zhejiang (Chekiang) province after moving out of Northern China in the 13th century AD. The 12th-century BC Duke of Zhou's (Duke of Chou) third son was the ancestor of the Chiangs.\n\n\n"}

He has also published poetry in French and Greek.\n\nDimitri Kitsikis is a Turkologist and Professor of International Relations and Geopolitics at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada since 1970, Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada; he received his doctoral degree in 1963 from the Sorbonne, Paris, under the supervision of Pierre Renouvin. He has been named one of the \"three top geopolitical thinkers worldwide, Karl Haushofer, Halford Mackinder and Dimitri Kitsikis\". While pursuing his doctoral studies in Paris, he worked from 1960 to 1962 as a research assistant at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva. He derives his origin from a notable Greek-Orthodox family of intellectuals and acclaimed professionals of 19th-century Greece. He holds both French and Canadian citizenships, in addition to his Greek citizenship.\n\nHis father, Nicolas Kitsikis (1887–1978), rector of the Polytechnic School in Athens, the most famous civil engineer of Greece, was a senator and an MP. His uncle, Konstantinos Kitsikis (1893–1969), a celebrated architect, Nicolas' younger brother, was also a professor at the Athens Polytechnic School. His grandfather, a chief justice, Dimitri Kitsikis senior (1850–1898), had settled in Athens, in 1865, from Lesbos, his native island and was married to Cassandra (Κασσάνδρα), the sister of a member of the Greek Parliament, Dimitri Hatsopoulos (Δημήτρης Χατσόπουλος), 1844–1913, born in Karpenisi.\n\nHis mother, Beata Kitsikis née Petychakis (Μπεάτα Πετυχάκη), was born in Herakleion, Crete, from a wealthy Cretan family and Greek Italian nobles from Trieste of mixed Roman Catholic and Orthodox origin. Her father, Emmanuel Petychakis founded a beverage production plant in Cairo, Egypt and her stepfather Aristidis Stergiadis was the High Commissioner of Greece in Smyrna (Izmir) from 1919 to 1922.\n\nDuring the Greek civil war, at the age of 12, he was sent to a boarding school in Paris, by Octave Merlier, the head of the French Institute in Athens, because his mother had been condemned to death as a communist fighter. He stayed in France for 23 years with his British wife Anne Hubbard, the daughter of a chief justice, whom he had married in Scotland in 1955, with his two first children, Tatiana and Nicolas. He was expelled from the French University for his active participation as a Maoist in the French student revolt of May 1968. Since 1958, Dimitri Kitsikis had traveled to the P.R. of China where he became a committed Maoist. He was then promoted to associate and later to full professor, after being invited to Canada in 1970 by the University of Ottawa. Since then, he has been living and working in Ottawa as well as in Athens, with his second wife, Ada (Αδαμαντία) Nikolarou, whom he married in 1975, the daughter of a farmer from the historic Byzantine town of Mystras, near Sparta and from whom he has two more children, Agis Ioannis Kitsikis and Kranay Kitsikis-De Leonardis. He is an admirer of the Byzantine Empire. Kitsikis is thus a Panhellen, a cosmopolitan Greek, holding Greek citizenship, in addition to French and Canadian ones.\n\nSince he was a child he had an idée fixe: He wanted not only to reconcile Greeks and Turks, but also to unite them into a Greek Turkish Confederation which would (to an extent) be a reincarnation of the Byzantine/Ottoman Empires; thus filling the political, cultural and economic vacuum that's left behind by their absence in the East Mediterranean region. A devout Orthodox Christian, he came to sympathise with the Turkish religion of Bektashism-Alevism and sought to ally it with Orthodoxy, in order to form a basis for a future political union between Athens and Ankara. Believing in the collaboration of religious communities, as in the millet system of the Ottoman Empire, he worked closely with Shia Muslims in Iran, Jews in Israel and Hindu vaishnavs in India. His elder son Nicolas has been a Vaishnav since 1984 and lives with his Hindu wife in the Vaishnav community of Gainesville, Florida. Although a member of the official Church of Greece, he always sympathised with the Old-Calendarist movement, the adherents of which reject the Church's use of the Gregorian (New) calendar and maintain a traditionalist attitude towards Christian life and worship. As Orthodoxy prevailed over the heresy of Iconoclasm in the 9th century and restored the use of the icon in Christian worship, he stands convinced that the Old Calendar will once again be adopted by those Orthodox Churches which rejected it in the earlier part of the 20th century.\n\nSince the 1970s he has taught Chinese and Turkish history, political ideologies and geopolitics at a number of universities in the West. His plethora of books have been translated in many languages, while articles concerning his work have been published in Chinese, the Balkan languages, German, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian. He also taught at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, where he had as a student, the future prime minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu. Kitsikis is considered to have had a decisive influence, on Davutoğlu's geopolitical theory.\n\nLater, he taught at Bilkent University in Ankara and Gediz University in Izmir and became one of the closest friends and advisers of the President of the Turkish Republic, Turgut Özal. In Greece, he was resident researcher at the National Institute of Social Studies and taught at Deree College, the American College in Athens.\n\nHe is a public figure in Greece and had been a close friend and advisor of Greek Premier Konstantinos Karamanlis senior in the 1960s and 1970s. He contributes regularly with political articles to Greek magazines and, since 1996, publishes in Athens a Greek quarterly journal of Geopolitics named after his civilisation model, «Endiamese Perioche, Ἐνδιάμεση Περιοχή» or \"Intermediate Region\".\n\nNamed after his father, who died in 1978, the \"Nikos Kitsikis Library and Archives\" resides in the home of family member, the former high commissioner of Smyrna (during the Greek occupation of the city between 1919 and 1922) Aristidis Stergiadis (1861–1949), in Herakleion, Crete. Dimitri Kitsikis was honoured by the Greek State in 2006. The latter established and financed the \"Dimitri Kitsikis Public Foundation and Library\" in Athens.\n\nKitsikis, since the 1960s, has been the recognised theorist, first in Greece and then in Turkey, of the idea of a Greek-Turkish Confederation, which he has promoted by influencing statesmen, politicians, journalists, artists and thinkers in both countries. His books in Turkish became best sellers in Turkey and were praised by the Prime Minister of Turkey. He kept close ties with Prime Ministers Konstantinos Karamanlis senior of Greece and Turgut Özal of Turkey as well as the Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. His books in Greek created one of the greatest controversies ever encountered in Greek historiography. They were even debated in the Greek Parliament. The well-established notion of Greeks enslaved by Turks and a series of beliefs on the Ottoman Empire, which had been traditionally taught in schools and universities throughout Greece, such as the story of the so-called \"secret school,\" were strongly questioned. While his father, Nikos Kitsikis, rector of the Polytechnical School, was a leftist Member of Parliament, Senator and elected Mayor of Athens, Dimitri Kitsikis is averse towards the parliamentary system, which he regards as foreign to the Greek model of a government by the people or \"laocracy\", Greek \"λαοκρατία\".\n\nHe has been the initiator in France of the branch of the History of International Relations that deals with propaganda and pressure as a government weapon of foreign policy. He also opened the way to the study of technocracy in international politics. He has insisted that religion is an essential component of international politics and strove by conferences and other means to facilitate the collaboration between the four main religions of Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism. He organised Orthodox dialogues with Iranian Shiites and Indian Hindus. He worked with Israeli Jews and fundamentalist Catholics from Quebec, where he, along with his students, produced the quarterly journal \"Aquila\" (eagle) which, with a double-headed eagle on the front cover promoted the Byzantine imperial idea in Catholic circles. He also worked closely with the Fethullah Gülen Sunni Muslim Movement (See Gülen's \"Dialog of Civilizations Platform\"). However, the idea of a global hellenism is prevalent in all his works and teaching.\n\nHe created a model for a new approach of the three political ideologies of liberalism, fascism and communism, and he has published on the history of China. He is the founder of the branch of study known as Photohistory.\n\nHe is also a recognised poet, with six collections of poetry published by Pierre Jean Oswald (Paris), Naaman (Québec), Kedros (Κέδρος), Hestia (Ἑστία) and Akritas (Ἀκρίτας). In 1991, he was honored with the first Greek-Turkish prize for poetry Abdi İpekçi, a Turkish journalist who had been shot dead by terrorists. Some of his poetry books, namely \"Omphalos\" (1977), \"l'Orocc dans l'âge de Kali\" (1985) and \"le Paradis perdu sur les barricades\" (1989–1993), became part of an anthology of 32 Canadian poets in the book by H. Bouraoui and J. Flamand. His poetic work was included in the \"Dictionnaire des citations littéraires de l'Ontario français, depuis 1960\". His poems were also used in the books by the Greek artist Georgette Kambani.\n\nKitsikis regards the Greek language as the cornerstone of planetary civilization, and he thus deems it an honour for one to be able to write in Greek. He believes that the treatment of the language should be taken out of the hands of Greek philologists who are currently destroying it. He defends the continued use of polytonic Greek, traditional spelling and the freedom to write in any literary tone. He regards as erroneous only the implementation of a Greek form not used from the time of Homer to today.\n\nHe is the founder of four concepts setting a novel approach for the history of the Greek-Turkish Area to be understood: a) The \"Intermediate Region\" (Endiamese Perioche, Ἐνδιάμεση Περιοχή) of civilisation, extending from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River, between the Euro-American West and the Hindu-Chinese East. b) Eastern Party in Greece and Turkey (Ἀνατολικὴ Παράταξις) versus Western Party (Δυτικὴ Παράταξις) as an antagonist couple; c) Hellenoturkism (Ἑλληνοτουρκισμός) as an ideology and as a phenomenon of culture for the last one thousand years; d) Bektashi-Alevi religious origin of the Ottoman Dynasty, the islamisation of which developed hand-in-hand with its secularisation and westernisation.\n\nIn 2007, \"A Comparative History of Greece and China from Antiquity to the Present\" was published. The book is notable in that it homes in on the relationship between the two civilisations throughout their entire history spanning three millennia. The study raises two concepts: 1) the Greek-Chinese civilisation in a global context and 2) its political expression during the last 2500 years, that is, ecumenical empire as a glorified organisational model.\n\nAhead of the September 2015 general elections in Greece, Kitsikis endorsed the Golden Dawn party, calling it \"the only patriotic choice.\"\n\nThe Centre for Research on Globalization described Kitsikis as having \"had a major influence on Turkish foreign policy.Turkey's previous good neighborly policy seemed to be in accordance with Kitsikian geopolitics but was sabotaged by Ankara's treacherous collaboration with U.S. chaos strategy in the Middle East since the U.S. fomented Arab Spring in 2011\".\n\nKitsikis was former prime minister Ahmet Davutoğlu's professor as well as a close adviser of former President Turgut Özal. He is considered to have had a decisive influence, on Davutoğlu's geopolitical theory.\n\nKitsikis wrote in both his Facebook and Twitter accounts, the day after the Turkish referendum: \"Christ is risen! The Empire is risen! The Ottoman world is risen! The Intermediate Region has come again to life! Long live president Erdoğan! Fethullah Gülen, former Erdoğan`s spiritual father has lost but his ideas, through his pupil Erdoğan have triumphed. Dimitri Kitsikis\".\n\nThe Dimitri Kitsikis Public Foundation in Athens, Greece, was formally established under Presidential Decree 129, A 190 (pp. 3425, 3430-3431). The Presidential Decree was published September 15, 2008 in the Gazette of the Government of Greece (ΦΕΚ).\n\n\n\nRegular contributions to monthly journal Trito Mati (Athens), since 1999 and to quarterly Endiamese Perioche (Athens), since 1996, as well as many scholarly articles in: Revue historique; Revue d'Histoire moderne et contemporaine; Revue d'Histoire de la Deuxième Guerre Mondiale; Revue française de Science politique; Problems of Communism; Turcica; CEMOTI-Cahiers d'Etudes sur la Méditerranée orientale et le Monde Turco-iranien; Social History; Bulletin de la Société d'Histoire moderne; Informations universitaires en Relations internationales; Aquila; Revue d'Histoire diplomatique; Journal of Oriental and African Studies; Cahiers de Jeune Nation; Journal-Institute of Muslim Minorities Affairs; Diplomatiques; The Patristic and Byzantine Review; Relations internationales; Études internationales; Diplomatie; Ἀρχεῖον Οἰκονομικῶν καὶ Κοινωνικῶν Ἐπιστημῶν, Καινούρια Ἐποχή, Νέα Οἰκονομία, Βιομηχανικὴ Ἐπιθεώρηση, Τεχνικὰ Χρονικά, Πολιτικὴ Οἰκονομικὴ Ἔρευνα, Τότε, Πάντα, Παράδοση, Ἀρχιτεκτονική, Ἐποχές, Νέα Ἑστία, Σύγχρονα Θέματα, Ἑλληνοκινεζικὰ Χρονικά, Orthodox Tradition; Eurasia; The Greek Review of Social Research; Toplum ve Bilim; Aktüel; Moderne Welt-Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen; Grande Europe, and others.

{"id": "35962585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35962585", "title": "Flame (malware)", "text": "Flame (malware)\n\nFlame, also known as Flamer, sKyWIper, and Skywiper, is modular computer malware discovered in 2012 that attacks computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. The program is being used for targeted cyber espionage in Middle Eastern countries.\n\nIts discovery was announced on 28 May 2012 by MAHER Center of Iranian National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), Kaspersky Lab and CrySyS Lab of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The last of these stated in its report that Flame \"is certainly the most sophisticated malware we encountered during our practice; arguably, it is the most complex malware ever found.\" Flame can spread to other systems over a local network (LAN) or via USB stick. It can record audio, screenshots, keyboard activity and network traffic. The program also records Skype conversations and can turn infected computers into Bluetooth beacons which attempt to download contact information from nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices. This data, along with locally stored documents, is sent on to one of several command and control servers that are scattered around the world. The program then awaits further instructions from these servers.\n\nAccording to estimates by Kaspersky in May 2012, Flame had initially infected approximately 1,000 machines, with victims including governmental organizations, educational institutions and private individuals. At that time 65% of the infections happened in Iran, Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, with a \"huge majority of targets\" within Iran. Flame has also been reported in Europe and North America. Flame supports a \"kill\" command which wipes all traces of the malware from the computer. The initial infections of Flame stopped operating after its public exposure, and the \"kill\" command was sent.\n\nFlame is linked to the Equation Group by Kaspersky Lab. However, Costin Raiu, the director of Kaspersky Lab's global research and analysis team, believes the group only cooperates with the creators of Flame and Stuxnet from a position of superiority: \"Equation Group are definitely the masters, and they are giving the others, maybe, bread crumbs. From time to time they are giving them some goodies to integrate into Stuxnet and Flame.\"\n\nFlame (a.k.a. Da Flame) was identified in May 2012 by MAHER Center of Iranian National CERT, Kaspersky Lab and CrySyS Lab (Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security) of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics when Kaspersky Lab was asked by the United Nations International Telecommunication Union to investigate reports of a virus affecting Iranian Oil Ministry computers. As Kaspersky Lab investigated, they discovered an MD5 hash and filename that appeared only on customer machines from Middle Eastern nations. After discovering more pieces, researchers dubbed the program \"Flame\" after one of the main modules inside the toolkit <nowiki>[</nowiki>FROG.DefaultAttacks.A-InstallFlame<nowiki>]</nowiki>.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, Flame had been operating in the wild since at least February 2010. CrySyS Lab reported that the file name of the main component was observed as early as December 2007. However, its creation date could not be determined directly, as the creation dates for the malware's modules are falsely set to dates as early as 1994.\n\nComputer experts consider it the cause of an attack in April 2012 that caused Iranian officials to disconnect their oil terminals from the Internet. At the time the Iranian Students News Agency referred to the malware that caused the attack as \"Wiper\", a name given to it by the malware's creator. However, Kaspersky Lab believes that Flame may be \"a separate infection entirely\" from the Wiper malware. Due to the size and complexity of the program—described as \"twenty times\" more complicated than Stuxnet—the Lab stated that a full analysis could require as long as ten years.\n\nOn 28 May, Iran's CERT announced that it had developed a detection program and a removal tool for Flame, and had been distributing these to \"select organizations\" for several weeks. After Flame's exposure in news media, Symantec reported on 8 June that some Flame command and control (C&C) computers had sent a \"suicide\" command to infected PCs to remove all traces of Flame.\n\nAccording to estimates by Kaspersky in May 2012, initially Flame had infected approximately 1,000 machines, with victims including governmental organizations, educational institutions and private individuals. At that time the countries most affected were Iran, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.\n\nFlame is an uncharacteristically large program for malware at 20 megabytes. It is written partly in the Lua scripting language with compiled C++ code linked in, and allows other attack modules to be loaded after initial infection. The malware uses five different encryption methods and an SQLite database to store structured information. The method used to inject code into various processes is stealthy, in that the malware modules do not appear in a listing of the modules loaded into a process and malware memory pages are protected with READ, WRITE and EXECUTE permissions that make them inaccessible by user-mode applications. The internal code has few similarities with other malware, but exploits two of the same security vulnerabilities used previously by Stuxnet to infect systems. The malware determines what antivirus software is installed, then customises its own behaviour (for example, by changing the filename extensions it uses) to reduce the probability of detection by that software. Additional indicators of compromise include mutex and registry activity, such as installation of a fake audio driver which the malware uses to maintain persistence on the compromised system.\n\nFlame is not designed to deactivate automatically, but supports a \"kill\" function that makes it eliminate all traces of its files and operation from a system on receipt of a module from its controllers.\n\nFlame was signed with a fraudulent certificate purportedly from the Microsoft Enforced Licensing Intermediate PCA certificate authority. The malware authors identified a Microsoft Terminal Server Licensing Service certificate that inadvertently was enabled for code signing and that still used the weak MD5 hashing algorithm, then produced a counterfeit copy of the certificate that they used to sign some components of the malware to make them appear to have originated from Microsoft. A successful collision attack against a certificate was previously demonstrated in 2008,\nbut Flame implemented a new variation of the chosen-prefix collision attack.\n\nLike the previously known cyber weapons Stuxnet and Duqu, it is employed in a targeted manner and can evade current security software through rootkit functionality. Once a system is infected, Flame can spread to other systems over a local network or via USB stick. It can record audio, screenshots, keyboard activity and network traffic. The program also records Skype conversations and can turn infected computers into Bluetooth beacons which attempt to download contact information from nearby Bluetooth enabled devices. This data, along with locally stored documents, is sent on to one of several command and control servers that are scattered around the world. The program then awaits further instructions from these servers.\n\nUnlike Stuxnet, which was designed to sabotage an industrial process, Flame appears to have been written purely for espionage. It does not appear to target a particular industry, but rather is \"a complete attack toolkit designed for general cyber-espionage purposes\".\n\nUsing a technique known as sinkholing, Kaspersky demonstrated that \"a huge majority of targets\" were within Iran, with the attackers particularly seeking AutoCAD drawings, PDFs, and text files. Computing experts said that the program appeared to be gathering technical diagrams for intelligence purposes.\n\nA network of 80 servers across Asia, Europe and North America has been used to access the infected machines remotely.\n\nOn 19 June 2012, \"The Washington Post\" published an article claiming that Flame was jointly developed by the U.S. National Security Agency, CIA and Israel’s military at least five years prior. The project was said to be part of a classified effort code-named Olympic Games, which was intended to collect intelligence in preparation for a cyber-sabotage campaign aimed at slowing Iranian nuclear efforts.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky's chief malware expert, \"the geography of the targets and also the complexity of the threat leaves no doubt about it being a nation-state that sponsored the research that went into it.\" Kaspersky initially said that the malware bears no resemblance to Stuxnet, although it may have been a parallel project commissioned by the same attackers.\nAfter analysing the code further, Kaspersky later said that there is a strong relationship between Flame and Stuxnet; the early version of Stuxnet contained code to propagate via USB drives that is nearly identical to a Flame module that exploits the same zero-day vulnerability.\n\nIran's CERT described the malware's encryption as having \"a special pattern which you only see coming from Israel\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that due to Flame's apparent targets—which included Iran, Syria, and the West Bank—Israel became \"many commentators' prime suspect\". Other commentators named China and the U.S. as possible perpetrators. Richard Silverstein, a commentator critical of Israeli policies, claimed that he had confirmed with a \"senior Israeli source\" that the malware was created by Israeli computer experts. \"The Jerusalem Post\" wrote that Israel's Vice Prime Minister Moshe Ya'alon appeared to have hinted that his government was responsible, but an Israeli spokesperson later denied that this had been implied. Unnamed Israeli security officials suggested that the infected machines found in Israel may imply that the virus could be traced to the U.S. or other Western nations. The U.S. has officially denied responsibility.\n\nA leaked NSA document mentions that dealing with Iran's discovery of FLAME is an NSA and GCHQ jointly-worked event.\n\n"}

After short academic contracts at University College London, and the universities of Swansea and Reading he joined Royal Holloway College (University of London) in 1972, lecturing in politics and contemporary history. He was made Professor of Politics and Contemporary History in 1988.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1994 he held senior administrative posts in the University of London and from 1994 to 1999 in Middlesex University.

At that inquiry (17 July 2008) the chairman of the House of Commons' Select Committee on Innovation, Universities and Skills accused the Quality Assurance Agency of being \"toothless\" and declared that the British degree classification system had \"descended into farce\". Alderman himself gave written and oral evidence to a subsequent enquiry of the Select Committee into Students and Universities, whose report (2 August 2009) included an endorsement of Alderman's views.\n\nIn early 2012, the Jewish Chronicle reported that complaints were made against a column by Alderman in which he wrote that \"it is well known that Charedi men are notorious harassers of the opposite sex\", that these comments breached accuracy and discrimination rules. The Press Complaints Commission rejected these complaints because it was clear to readers that the content was written from Alderman's own perspective and whether or not the article was offensive requires subjective judgement. \n\nOf his dozen or so books, the best-known is \"Modern British Jewry\" (second edition, 1998, OUP).

He is commonly known as \"Oviedo\" even though his family name is Fernández. He participated in the Spanish colonization of the Caribbean, and wrote a long chronicle of this project which is one of the few primary sources about it. For three centuries, only a small portion of it was published, which was widely read in the 16th century in Spanish, English and French editions.\n\nHe was born in Madrid of a noble Asturian lineage and educated in the court of Ferdinand and Isabella. At thirteen, he became page to their son, the \"Infante\" John, Prince of Asturias. After the Prince's death (October 4, 1497), Oviedo went to Italy, and there acted as secretary to Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. In 1514 he was appointed supervisor of gold smeltings at Santo Domingo, and on his return to Spain in 1523 was appointed historiographer of the Indies. He paid five more visits to America before his death, in Valladolid in 1557. At one point he was placed in charge of the Fortaleza Ozama, the famous fort in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, where there is a large statue of him, a gift to that country from a King of Spain.\n\nOviedo's first literary work was a chivalric romance entitled, \"Libro del muy esforzado e invencible caballero Don Claribalte\" (\"Book of the very striving and invincible knight Don Claribalte\"). It was published in 1519 in Valencia by Juan Viñao, one of the prominent printers of that time. In the foreword, dedicated to Ferdinand of Aragón, Duke of Calabria (not to be confused with the King Ferdinand II of Aragon), Oviedo relates that the work had been conceived and written while he was in Santo Domingo. Therefore, it seems that this was the first literary work created in the New World.\n\nOviedo wrote later two extensive works of permanent value, which for the most part were not published until three centuries after his death: \"La historia general y natural de las Indias\" and \"Las Quinquagenas de la nobleza de España\". The former work was first issued at Toledo (1526) in the form of a summary entitled \"La Natural hystoria de las Indias\"; the first part of \"La Historia general de las Indias\" appeared at Seville in 1535; but the complete work was not published till 1851-1855, when it was edited by J.A. de los Rios for the Spanish Academy of History. The \"Quinquagenas\" is a collection of quaint, moralizing anecdotes in which Oviedo indulges in much lively gossip concerning eminent contemporaries. It was first published at Madrid in 1880, edited by Vicente de la Fuente.\n\nThe \"Historia\", though written in a diffuse style, furnishes a mass of information collected at first hand. Las Casas, the fellow contemporary chronicler of the Spanish colonization of the Caribbean, denounced Oviedo and the \"Historia\" thus: \"one of the greatest tyrants, thieves, and destroyers of the Indies, whose \"Historia\" contains almost as many lies as pages\".

The first illustration of a pineapple is credited to him. Shortly after Columbus was in Hispaniola, Oviedo visited there and saw the natives using green wooden stakes lashed to a frame over a smouldering fire for cooking.

After studying chemistry and philosophy at Manchester University, he joined the Dominicans in 1949, where under Victor White he began his lifelong study of the works of Thomas Aquinas. Born John Ignatius McCabe, his novice master, Columba Ryan, gave McCabe the religious name \"Herbert\", perhaps ironically, in honour of Saint Herbert of Derwentwater, a seventh-century Lakeland hermit.\n\nHe became editor of the journal \"New Blackfriars\" in 1965 but was removed in 1967 following a now-famous editorial in that journal in which he criticised the theologian Charles Davis for having left the Catholic Church. Davis left publicly, denouncing the church as corrupt. McCabe countered that of course the Church was corrupt but that this was no reason to leave it. He was reinstated three years later, and began his editorial that month in characteristically combative style: \"As I was saying, before I was so oddly interrupted...\" He spent many years teaching at Blackfriars, Oxford University, writing four books, \"The New Creation\", a study of the Sacraments, in 1964; \"Law, Love and Language\", on the centrality of language in ethics, in 1968; \"The Teaching of the Catholic Church\", a short catechism, in 1986; \"God Matters\" in 1987; and \"God Still Matters\", a collection of his articles, in 2002. He was a member of the \"Slant\" group, and combined a commitment to the thought of Aquinas and Wittgenstein with a socialist political stance.\n\nMcCabe's sermons were carefully prepared and delivered with great intelligence and wit. A major theme was a caution against making God a god, of reducing the Creator to an object within this world, and thus committing idolatry. In 1974 McCabe became an Irish citizen.\n\nTerry Eagleton attributed to his friend McCabe the view that 'If you don't love, you're dead, and if you do, they'll kill you.' \nMcCabe died at Oxford on 28 June 2001, and was buried at Wolvercote Cemetery on 5 July.\n\n\n\n"}

Baumgarten's philosophy also created a significant political impression on Max Weber, an influential social theorist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nHermann Baumgarten was born in Wolfenbüttel in the Duchy of Brunswick. He studied philology and history at the University of Jena before becoming a journalist in 1855. In 1859 he began working at Maximilian Duncker's \"literary bureau\", a Prussian institution used to disseminate propaganda. In 1861, he also took up a teaching post at the Technical University of Karlsruhe.\n\nAs a champion of Prussian/German liberalism, Baumgarten faced the dilemma as to whether or not to accept the military and political successes of Prussia's conservative Prime Minister, Otto von Bismarck. In 1866, Baumgarten published his support of Bismarck's policies in an essay entitled \"A Self-Criticism of German Liberalism\". This work essentially ended radical German liberalism as a force, whereupon many Prussians joined the Bismarck-supporting National Liberal Party), and allowed the new German empire to nationalize and solidify.\n\nIn 1872, Baumgarten became Professor of History at the Reichsuniversität in Strasbourg. During the late 1880s and early 1890s, Baumgarten made a significant political impression upon Max Weber, Baumgarten's nephew by marriage. Weber would go on to profoundly influence social theory and the remit of sociology itself. At the age of 68, Baumgarten died in Strasbourg, Alsace-Lorraine.\n\n"}

Her field of expertise was the ethnography, culture, folklore and language of the people of East Polynesia. Feodorova was doctor of historical sciences and a leading scientist of the Department of Australia, Oceania and Indonesia at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (Russian Academy of Science) at the Kunstkamera, St. Petersberg, the first Russian museum that was named after Peter the Great. In 1981, Feodorova was given the honour of being named N. N. Miklouho-Maclay Laureate of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Science.\n\nFeodorova was born in Leningrad in 1931. Her father, Konstantin Andreevich Mozhajsky, worked in a printing house. Her mother, Lydia Romanovna Steinberg taught German at schools in Leningrad. Feodorova and her husband, Mikhail Lvovich Fedorov, had one daughter, Olga Fedorova.\n\nIn 1964, Fedorova participated in the \"VII International Congress of Archeology and Ethnography\" in Moscow. In 1966, she completed her Master's degree with a thesis entitled, \"Folklore of Easter island as a historical source\".\n\nIn 1978, Feodorova published her first monograph, \"Myths and legends of Easter Island\". It is a seminal study of the relics of Rapanui folklore. This publication earned Feodorova the honour of being named the \"N. N. Miklouho-Macklay Laureate\" of the \"Presidium of the Russian Academy of Science\" in 1981. In 1987, her work was translated into Hungarian and republished in Budapest. The book includes Feodorova's translations of the Easter Island legends recorded in the 1956 manuscripts of the Norwegian researcher Thor Heyerdahl. Heyerdahl approached the Kunstkamera to help with the translation of the Rapanui language because of the institution's reputation in decipherment. He published the Feodorova translations in his \"Works of the Norwegian archeological expedition\" (Vol 2, 1965). \n\nFeodorova continued to study Rapanui culture and in 1988 published her second monograph on the subject. This work includes a basic dictionary of Rapanui language (direct and reverse). It also includes a translation of the 1974 publication of Rapanui text by the German researcher, Thomas Barthel.\n\nIn 1994, Feodorova gained her Doctorate with the book, \"Easter island. Sketches of the culture of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\" The book examines the history of the population of Easter Island; the ethnogenesis of its inhabitants; and theories about the original ancient civilisation. Feodorova analysed the culture of the indigenous people of Rapanui including their folklore, language, chanting connected with string games, features of a tattoo and the stone statues. She examined the meaning of funeral braids and carved wooden figures.\n\nIn 1995, Feodorova published a third monograph. It contained her attempt at deciphering the two rongorongo tablets in the Kunstkamera. This work earned Feodorova the Premium of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The monograph presents the full texts and Feodorova's translations of two Rapanui plates from the Kunstkamera collection.\n\nFeodorova's studies of the Kohau RongoRongo script date from the 1960s. More rigorous than most attempts, she restricts each glyph to a single logographic reading. However, the results make little sense as texts. For example, the Mamari calendar, the single rongorongo text that can be read, contains no calendrical information in Feodorova's decipherment, but reads instead like the following sample:\nwhich even Fedorova characterized as \"worthy of a maniac\". What Feodorova translates as \"root\", the small community of rongorongo specialists agree is instead a calendrical night. Konstantin Pozdniakov concluded that Feodorova's translations \"are not accompanied by the least justification\".\n\nIn 2001, Feodorova published her attempts at decoding, reading, and translating all the examples of ancient Rapanui text from museums around the world. This work includes the \"Tomenika Tau a Ure\" tablet recorded in the manuscript of Francis Mazier.\n\nFeodorova's fifth book, \"Missionaries of Easter Island\" (2004) is devoted to the history of the first Catholic Rapanui mission and the relationship of the missionaries to original Rapanui culture. It uses rare archival materials and publications of the Catholic mission, the \"Congregation de Sacres Coeurs\" (Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary). Feodorova demonstrates the positive role the missionaries played in Rapanui in the 19th century in the study and preservation of the indigenous population and their culture.\n\nFeodorova has contributed many articles to the international scientific community. Her focus is the ethnography, culture, folklore and language of the inhabitants of Easter Island. She has also written about the inhabitants of other islands of Polynesia such as Hawaii, New Zealand, Marquises, Mangarewa, Tahiti, Samoa and Tonga. Feodorova's other studies concern the origin of people of Oceania; Pacific oceanic contacts; the role of the Areoi (a society of secret warriors) in Polynesia; the linguistics of Polynesian and American Indian languages. She has also researched petroglyphs, zodiac signs, ancient calendars, paleoastronomy, toponyms, terms of relationship and social systems, material culture, mythology, religious views, magic fairy tales, games, tattoos and the meanings of Polynesian sculptural and carved images.\n\nFrom 1995, Feodorova was a member of the informal cultural group \"The way of the ancestors\". The group researched and published the history and the work of the first Russian round-the-world expedition (1803−1806). \nAs part of the Russian world expedition, A. J. Krusenstern in the \"Nadeshda\" and J. F. Lisjansky in the \"Neva\" sailed to the islands of East Polynesia, including Easter Island, Marquesas and Hawaii. Feodorova contributed to the scientific album, \"Around the world with Krusenstern\" (2005) and was the co-author in the collective monograph, \"Russians in the 'Silent sea'\" (2006). In 2001, the memorial edition, \" The Russian Geographical Society: 165 years of service to Fatherland\". Feodorova studied the diaries and letters of I. K. Horner, F. I. Shemelin, M. I. Ratmanov and other participants of the first Russian round-the-world voyage.\n\nFeodorova's last work \"The Semantics of sculptural and carved images in subjects of the Polynesian collections of Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (Russian Academy of Science)\" and many other works is unpublished.\n\n\n"}

He stopped in Holland with the intention of publishing an account of his travels.

On 3 May 1710, when he was 15, he moved to Madrid to join Benedictine order.\nHe was named presbyter in 1720, Sarmiento lived in Asturias until 1725 like a professor in Cebrio and Oviedo. Later he left his mother in Pontevedra. He was definitively settled in Madrid, stay that is interrupted between February 1726 and May 1727, when he moved to Toledo to catalog the books of the cathedral, and also to visit three times Galicia.\n\nWhen he was 35 years old, he became interested in language again. He thought that people ignored the meaning of the words. He was really interested in languages in general, especially Romanesque languages, but above all, Spanish and Galician. Sarmiento thought that Galician should be taught in schools and priests should know it in order to confess people.\nIn 1745 he returned to Galicia. On this trip he writes the names of the places he is going through in a notebook. He liked to investigate the etymology of the Galician words. He wrote a book in Galician called Colloquium of twenty rustic galleys, thanks to which we know the Galician that was spoken at that time. It contains 1,200 songs sung by a group of Galicians returning from Madrid. They tell us about the death of King Philip V was and he described the celebrations of the accession to the throne of Ferdinand VI.\n\nSarmiento was not only interested in linguistics, he was interested in other disciplines such as botany and medicine. He had a big knowledge of the names of the plants and their health properties. He was quite concerned about the improvement of the technical and economic level of his country, specially in the Enlightenment ideas. His erudition in many disciplines made him be commissioned the iconographic program that would decorate the Royal Palace of Madrid. Sarmiento designed an ambitious allegory of the history of the Spanish monarchy for the palace, it was so complex that only a part of it was done.\n\nHe fought, with Feijoo, against superstition and ignorance, proposing to open libraries in the villages. He had one of the most important libraries in Spain at that time. Unlike his teacher Feijoo, Sarmiento understood that it was necessary to know and keep traditions and popular culture. In that he was a great precursor and he contributed to the investigation and recovery of the Galician culture.\n\nSarmiento died at San Martin convent in Madrid, on December, 7th, 1772, aged 77.\n\nHe posted two books in Feijoo´s memory Demostración crítico-apologética del Theatro Crítico Universal in 1732.

{"id": "4763082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4763082", "title": "Mexican Revolution in popular culture", "text": "Mexican Revolution in popular culture\n\nThere is a wide range of ways in which people have represented the Mexican Revolution in popular culture. One of the most influential pioneers in this new philosophy of Mexican identity was Samuel Ramos who acknowledged Ortega for his influence of emphasizing the understanding of man in his concrete historical circumstances. In his book, \"Profile of man and Culture in Mexico\", Ramos tried to develop a psychoanalysis of Mexican character. He felt Mexican problems were the result of imitating European models without being able to overcome the legacy of revolutions, dictatorships and economic stagnation. He felt that Mexican history was the expression of a collective inferiority complex stemming from the results of the Spanish Conquest, racial mixture and a disadvantageous geographical position. He believed that in hiding their inferiority, Mexicans had resorted to unhealthy compensations including aggressive assertions of power that have isolated Mexicans from one another and prevented the attainment of a sense of community. The solution Ramos proposed to this problem was a greater self-consciousness of a uniquely Mexican identity and the need for an education system with a humanistic orientation that would counter the materialistic civilization stemming from North American influence. Even though Ramos was an intellectual literary leader, in the effort to develop a national philosophy more effectively geared to Mexican circumstances, he was vulnerable to the accusations that he was attached to a type of utopian thinking. He was accused of not being able to bridge the gap between the values to which he was attached and the concrete political-economic circumstances of Mexican society. Octavio Paz carried on Ramos’ psychoanalytic approach but developed it in a closer relationship to the concrete realities of Mexican historical developments and its contemporary economic-political problems. Paz is also influential because he emphasizes context of Latin American and Third World political development. \n\nThe paragraphs thus far have described the history and development of the new paths and ideas that influenced the literature produced during the Revolution but here is a look at poetry specifically. The first decade of the Mexican Revolution put an end to the years of \"peace\" that the country was used to during the Diaz dictatorship. The turbulent political decade that followed the Diaz reign showed little cultural activity according to David Foster. \n\nBut the revolutionary events did have some impact on literature and the plastic arts. Some poets like Nervo, never showed the conflict of the times in his poetry. But other poets like Tablada, Enrique González Martínez, and Ramón López Velarde who produced during this period between modernism and the vanguardia movement have been credited as the major figures who contributed to the development of twentieth-century poetry in Mexico. In 1911, Enrique González Martínez published \"\"Tuercele el cuello al cisne\" (Wring the Neck of the Swan) written in 1910 which called for a change to the new image and a new language. In Dario's \"Cantos de vida y esperanza\"\" (Songs of Life and Hope) he writes without breaking with past but returns to society and expresses concern with political events.\n"}

He chaired the New Zealand Historic Places Trust between 1978 and 1986.\n\nBorn in Dunedin on 13 April 1915, Begg was the younger son of surgeon Charles Mackie Begg and Lillian Helen Lawrance Begg (née Treadwell), and nephew of Robert Campbell Begg. His father served throughout World War I, becoming the senior medical officer with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, but contracted influenza and pneumonia and died at Twickenham, London, in February 1919. Begg and his mother and brother, who had travelled to England at the end of the war, then returned to New Zealand.\n\nBegg was educated at John McGlashan College in Dunedin, and then studied medicine at the University of Otago, graduating MB ChB in 1941.

He was also known by his latinised name Trigautius or Trigaultius, and his Chinese name Jin Nige ().\n\nBorn in Douai (then part of the Spanish Netherlands, now part of France), he became a Jesuit in 1594. Trigault left Europe to do missionary work in Asia around 1610, eventually arriving at Nanjing, China in 1611. He was later brought by the Chinese Catholic Li Zhizao to his hometown of Hangzhou where he worked as one of the first missionaries ever to reach that city and was eventually to die there in 1628.\n\nIn late 1612 Trigault was appointed by the China Mission's Superior, Niccolo Longobardi as the China Mission's procurator (recruitment and PR representative) in Europe. He sailed from Macau on February 9, 1613, and arrived in Rome on October 11, 1614, by way of India, the Persian Gulf and Egypt. His tasks involved reporting on the mission's progress to Pope Paul V, successfully negotiating with the Jesuit Order's General Claudio Acquaviva the independence of the China Mission from the Japan Mission, and traveling around Europe to raise money and publicize the work of the Jesuit missions. Peter Paul Rubens did a portrait of Trigault on 17 January 1617, when Trigault was either in Antwerp or Brussels (at right).\n\nIt was during this trip to Europe that Trigault edited and translated (from Italian to Latin) Matteo Ricci's \"China Journal\", or \"De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas\". (He, in fact, started the work aboard the ship when sailing from Macau to India). The work was published in 1615 in Augsburg; it was later translated into many European languages and widely read. The French translation, which appeared in 1616, was translated from Latin by Trigault's own nephew, David-Floris de Riquebourg-Trigault.\n\nIn April 1618, Trigault sailed from Lisbon with over 20 newly recruited Jesuit missionaries, and arrived in Macau in April 1619.\nTrigault produced one of the first systems of Chinese Romanisation (based mostly on Ricci's earlier work) in 1626, in his work \"Xiru Ermu Zi\" (). Trigault wrote his book in Shanxi province.\n\nAided by a converted Chinese, he also produced the first Chinese version of \"Aesop's Fables\" (況義 \"Analogy\"), published in 1625.\n\nIn the 1620s Trigault became involved in a dispute over the correct Chinese terminology for the Christian God and defended the use of the term \"Shangdi\" that had been prohibited in 1625 by the Jesuit Superior General Muzio Vitelleschi. André Palmeiro, the Society of Jesus inspector assigned the task of investigating and reporting on the circumstances of Trigault's death in 1628, on information from Trigault's confessor Lazzaro Cattaneo, stated that a mentally unstable Trigault had become deeply depressed after failing to successfully defend the use of the term, and had committed suicide.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is often related to family history, when family historians are engaged in capturing their own living history to leave as a legacy for future generations. This branch of family history is allied to the growth in activities such as photograph and record scanning which seeks to preserve materials beyond their original life.\n\nModern personal archiving is often concerned with digital preservation, especially with collating individual's content from social media websites and ensuring the long-term preservation of this. This often deals with migration of digital content, as a means of preservation, rather than the tradition tasks of conservation of paper-based records.\n\nIndividuals involved in personal archiving consider all media to be relevant sources as long as this relates to the life, memories and experiences of a person. The majority of material is written, photographic, audio or video in nature. Those experiences can relate to their lives, those of living relatives or ancestors.\nThose engaged in this practice also see their life experiences as a potential source of historical and cultural record, as well as being able to re-live those moments personally. Many see the digital age as bringing an opportunity to leave a richer legacy for future generations.\n\nPersonal archives may not always be in the vein of genealogy. They may not always even be indicative of the individual who created the collection. A personal archive can range massively in content. For example one individual may deem their record collection as a personal archive and then another person may deem their dry-cleaning receipts worthy of retention. One such example of the latter was the actress Vivien Leigh. What will be of interest for research in the future is unpredictable. However, Leigh's laundry receipts provided insight into how mid twentieth century haute couture was preserved and presented in public.\n\n\n\n"}

He was proclaimed as Heir Apparent by his father on February 22, 1799 and confirmed by the Russian Tsar Paul I, an official protector of Georgia, on 18 April 1799.

He became a lieutenant general the same year.\n\nOn his father's death in December 1800, David became the head of the Royal House of Bagrationi but was not allowed to ascend the throne of Kartli-Kakheti. David ruled briefly between the time of his father's death (December 28, 1800) and the arrival of General Knorring (May 24, 1801). In November 1800 the Russian Tsar had prohibited him from doing that without Russian consent. On January 18, 1801 he was surprised by a decree of Paul I declaring the annexation of the Kingdom to the Russian Empire. He tried to remain in power as de facto head of state.

By law the aforementioned station should instead have been located near the UBA's , being that the Plaza Intendente Alvear is part of Historic Protection Area No. 14, and for that reason the extraction of vegetal species, as well as the modification of its design, roads, and paths are prohibited.

Dedi had done other effects, such as decapitating a bird, then reattaching the head to resurrect it. (This is disputed as there is nothing in reference to Dedi, specifically in the Westcar Papyrus, to indicate that he performed the cups and balls for anyone. The famous drawing of two men seemingly performing the cups and balls, from the tomb of Baqet III at Beni Hasan is believed by most experts to show a game using pots or cups but details of the game are unknown.) (Note: Since there is no indication that Dedi performed the Cups and Balls, and the Beni Hasan tomb painting is considered unlikely to represent the effect, there is no certain evidence for the existence of the cups and balls during this period.)\n\n1300 -650 B.C. - References to magic are abundant in the ancient Greek myths among the classical founding pagan cultures of Europe, connected to the neighbouring Egyptian and Persian ones. Often centered around women of divine origin, nymphs and priests, from Ariadne to Calypso, Circe to Medea, Hermes to Hecate, magic, divination and necromancy are widespread and intertwined with cthonic Gods and monsters, oracles and heroes.\n\n50–300 A.D. - The Acetabularii performed the Cups and balls in ancient Rome using stones and small vinegar cups (hence the name Acetabularii). The Acetabularii are a group of magicians specializing on the cups and balls effect.\n\n400–1000 - The Dark Ages; little is known about the history of magic, but much of it was associated with the occult and magic as entertainment is not prominent.\n\n1000–1500 - The Middle Ages where much magic was associated with the occult and witchcraft.

A conceptual deadlock exists until the resulting hysteric breakdown precipitates some kind of resolution, therefore the Hysteria is a vanishing mediator in this case.\n\nIn terms of political history, it refers to social movements, which operate in a particular way to influence politics, until they either are forgotten or change their purpose.\n\nFredric Jameson introduced the term in a 1973 essay (\"The Vanishing Mediator: Narrative Structure in Max Weber,\" in New German Critique 1 [Winter, 1973]: 52-89). Alain Badiou uses a similar, but more explicitly post-structuralist term (″terme évanouissant″ or ″vanishing term″) in \"Théorie du sujet\".\n\nSince, this concept has been adopted by Žižek in \"For They Know Not What They Do: Enjoyment as a Political factor\", where he uses it in a political sense, similar to Marx's Analysis of Revolution.\n"}

Writing for abolitionist newspapers \"The Liberator\" and \"The North Star\", he helped publicize the anti-slavery cause. He published the \"North Star\" from 1847 to 18xx, moving temporarily to Rochester, New York.\n\nHe also helped found the New England Freedom Association in the early 1840s, and later the Committee of Vigilance, to aid refugee slaves. The Committee of Vigilance supported resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which had increased penalties against even citizens in free states who aided refugee slaves.\n\nNell's short histories, \"Services of Colored Americans in the Wars of 1776 and 1812\" (1851) and \"The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution\" (1855), were the first studies published about African Americans. He is noted as the first African American to serve in the federal civil service, where he worked in the post office.\n\nNell was born in 1816 in Boston, Massachusetts to Louise Cooper, from Brookline, and William Guion Nell, from Charleston, South Carolina. His father was an important figure in the abolitionist movement, having helped to create the Massachusetts General Colored Association in the 1820s. Nell encountered racial discrimination as a student. In 1829 he was passed over for an award given to excellent students upon graduation from the Abiel Smith School, apparently because of his ethnicity, and excluded from a celebratory dinner. He managed to attend as a waiter. The award was financially supported by the estate of anti-slavery advocate Benjamin Franklin. The school committee instead gave Nell \"The Life of Ben Franklin\", an autobiography.\n\nInspired by the founding of William Lloyd Garrison's newspaper, \"The Liberator\", Nell decided to challenge race-based discrimination and segregation, as his father had done. Nell was particularly interested in encouraging the intellectual and social well-being of young African Americans. He was dedicated to integration and opposed the separate abolitionist organizations for blacks and whites. In his devotion to integration, he dismantled the abolitionist Massachusetts General Colored Association, which had been organized by his father.\n\nNell studied law in the early 1830s. He was never admitted to the bar because he would not swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States, as he believed it was a pro-slavery document. He was influenced by the opinions of Garrison and Wendell Phillips. Around this time, Nell also began his association with Garrison and \"The Liberator\". This connection would continue until the paper closed in 1865. Nell fought for the ideals of Garrison throughout the abolitionist campaign.\n\nNell began working against the existing system of segregated schools for black and white children in Massachusetts, gathering 2,000 signatures from the black community on a petition to the state legislature. In 1855 Nell and his colleagues gained a victory; segregation was ended in Boston schools. Nell also encouraged young African Americans to learn outside of the public school system. Garrison said of him, \"Perhaps no one has done so much—certainly no one has done more—for the intellectual and moral improvement of our colored youth.\"\n\nIn 1843, Nell continued his crusade against segregation within the abolitionist movement by denouncing the Buffalo National Negro Convention. He claimed they served as, and promoted, exactly the type of separate abolitionism he was fighting against.\n\nOn the other hand, he was influential in beginning the New England Freedom Association, an all-black organization that helped fugitive slaves in the North. In this case, Nell supported an African-American group since he believed its cause was closer to the hearts of blacks than whites. Nell publicized the Freedom Association's direct aid to fugitive slaves as well as the abolitionist cause. He also fought for higher education and encouraged the improvement of young African Americans; with John T. Hilton, he founded the Adelphia Union and the Young Men's Literary Society of Boston.\n\nHe was a leader in campaigns to desegregate public facilities in Boston: he succeeded in gaining desegregation of the Boston railroad in 1843, and, in 1853, performance halls in the city.\n\nNell served as publisher to Frederick Douglass' \"The North Star\", from late 1847 until 1851, moving temporarily to Rochester, New York, during this period. He also joined New York anti-slavery societies and founded a literary society. He ended his work with Douglass during the latter's feud with his close friend Garrison. Nell ended all contact with Douglass finally in 1853 when the leader advocated the Colored National Council and the Manual Labor School, which represented the types of segregated institutions which Nell detested. Douglass attacked Nell and other leading black activists who supported Garrison, including Robert Purvis of Philadelphia and Charles Lenox Remond.\n\nIn 1850, Nell had run as a Free Soil candidate for the Massachusetts state legislature, but lost. Passage of the federal Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 required state law enforcement, even in free states, to aid in the recapture of refugee slaves and it increased penalties for those citizens who helped slaves. Nell was inspired to renew his fight against slavery. He created the Committee of Vigilance in Boston, whose members swore to aid escaped slaves. It served a similar purpose to the Freedom Association of 1842, but was illegal under the new federal law. Nell also supported the Underground Railroad, which had numerous supporters to help slaves reach freedom in the North, with some going on to Canada.\n\nIn 1851, Nell and other petitioners requested money from the state legislature to commission a monument to Crispus Attucks, one of the first martyrs of the American Revolution. When Boston commissioned a major monument to the Boston Massacre to be installed on the Common in 1888, the fallen Attucks was featured in it prominently.\n\nA few years later, in 1855 Nell achieved another success when the legislature finally abolished segregation in public schools. In recognition of Nell's efforts on this issue, a commemorative dinner was held to honor him. During 1855, Garrison's \"The Liberator\" employed Nell to journey around the Midwest and study African-American anti-slavery efforts. He attended a graduation at Oberlin College, appreciating the easy relations among the integrated students.\n\nNell was outraged by the US Supreme Court ruling in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" ruling in 1857, which said that ethnic Africans had no legal standing in the United States as they were not considered citizens under the Constitution. In 1858 He organized a memorial celebration of Crispus Attucks at Faneuil Hall, a traditional site of commemoration, and worked with others to have a \"Crispus Attucks Day\" designated in Boston. He reminded people of the participation of African Americans in the fight for independence from Great Britain, and helped have Attucks recognized in the commemoration of the Boston Massacre. That same year, Nell organized the Convention of Colored Citizens of New England. While it was contrary to his earlier dislike of segregated abolitionist efforts, he argued that the \"Scott\" decision was such an insult to blacks that they needed to act separately.\n\nIn his time apart from the newspapers, Nell worked for legislation to allow blacks into the Massachusetts militia. He did not succeed in this but lived to see blacks serve in United States armed forces during the Civil War.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War, Nell worked to have blacks accepted as soldiers in the Union Army. In 1861, he was hired as a postal clerk in Boston, earning the distinction of being the first African American to hold a federal civilian post. On April 14, 1869, Nell married Frances Ann Ames, the twenty-six-year-old daughter of Philip Osgood Ames, a barber from Nashua, New Hampshire and his wife Lucy B. (Drake) Ames. The Nells had two sons, William Cooper, Jr. (1870–92) and Frank Ames (1872–81).\n\nNell died of a stroke in 1874 at the age of 58. His wife survived him by more than twenty years, dying in Nashua, New Hampshire, on September 13, 1895.\n\nThe William Cooper Nell House, now a private residence in Beacon Hill, was designated a National Historic Landmark in recognition for his contributions to the abolition movement. He lived at that home in the 1860s.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30741545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30741545", "title": "World's largest palace", "text": "World's largest palace\n\nThe title of the \"world's largest palace\" is difficult to award, and controversial, as different countries use different standards to claim that their palace is the largest in the world.\n\nThe title of \"world's largest palace by area enclosed within the palace's fortified walls\" is held by China's Forbidden City complex in Beijing, which covers an area of 728,000 square meters (180 acres). The 980 buildings of the Forbidden City have a combined floor space of and contain 9,999 rooms (It was because that antient Chinese thought the yuhuang god has 10000 rooms, they made 9999 and half rooms slightly lesser to show the respect).\n\nThe world's largest palace by both floor space and volume is the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest, Romania, which was built by communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu in 1986. It has a floor space of 330,000 m2 and a volume of 2,550,000 m3. It is also the most expensive administrative building and heaviest building. The \"world's largest royal palace by floor space\" is the Royal Palace of Madrid in Spain, with of floorspace and containing 3,418 rooms.\n\nThe \"world's largest royal palace by volume\" is the Royal Palace of Caserta in Caserta, Italy, with more than 2 million cubic meters (70 million cubic feet).\n\nThe title of \"world's largest royal domain,\" as measured by the total area of the property, goes to Balmoral Castle in Scotland. The castle’s grounds cover 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres), or \n\nThe Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, with 1000 rooms on 13 levels, and over 130,000 square meters of floor space, is one of the largest palaces in the world by floor area. It was the winter residence of the Dalai Lama until 1959. (Many sources, e.g. give the area as 360,000 square meters.)\n\nIn the castle category, Prague Castle claims to be world's largest. However, despite the singular name, Prague Castle is not a single building. Like the Forbidden City, it comprises a number of palaces, temples, and halls (constructed over several centuries) that share a common defensive wall. Altogether, the complex covers 18 acres, leading to the self-appointed title of \"Largest coherent castle complex in the world.\"\n\nWhile many buildings carry the title of \"palace,\" they either are no longer, or were never intended to be, used as a royal residence, a sovereign residence or a bishop residence.\n\nRomania's Palace of the Parliament contains of floorspace, it was never a royal residence, as Romania's last monarch abdicated in 1947, but it was the palace intended to be used by the sovereign Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's supreme ruler and dictator.\n\nEngland's Palace of Westminster was built in the Middle Ages as a royal residence. It served as the principal residence of the monarch until 1522, when Henry VIII moved his court to the newly acquired Palace of Whitehall. Since that time, the palace at Westminster has been used by the House of Lords, the House of Commons and various courts. The majority of the medieval palace was destroyed by fire in 1834, with construction of the current building starting in 1840. The palace which now stands on the site was designed specifically for parliamentary use, however it is the property of the monarch in right of the Crown and retains its status as a royal residence. Very little of the medieval palace survived, but the most significant is Westminster Hall, built in 1097 during the reign of William II.\n\nSeveral palaces are former royal residences that reached their current grand sizes after they ceased being used as royal residences, and were converted to some other purpose.\n\nThe best example of such subsequent expansion is the Louvre Palace. As a royal residence, the Louvre Palace was much smaller than the modern day Louvre Museum. The Louvre Palace was abandoned as a royal residence in 1682, when Louis XIV moved his court to the Palace of Versailles. The Louvre Palace was relegated to the role of displaying royal collections and hosting administrative services, and over the centuries it went through several renovations, expansions and additions, including a significant one as an Imperial Palace during the second French Empire in the 19th century. It only reached its current size of in 1988, as the modern Louvre Museum.\n\nRussia's Winter Palace and its annexes were not expanded after the Revolution, but the State Hermitage Museum also occupies other buildings which add to the size of the museum, but not to the palace. The Winter Palace contained of floorspace as a royal residence. However, the modern Hermitage Museum complex, centered on the Winter Palace, contains of floorspace. This includes the Small and the Old Hermitage buildings that were annexes to the main palace, which were used by the Imperial Court and are part of the palace complex. The same is true of the New Hermitage, that was used as a museum for the Imperial collections ever since it was built. All three Hermitages and the Hermitage Theatre can therefore be considered both independent buildings and wings of the Winter Palace. Despite a size which overshadows most other great palaces in Europe, the Winter Palace does not contain as much floorspace, because most of the State apartments in the north and east wings are two floors high.\n\nWith of floorspace, the Royal Palace of Madrid is often considered the largest functioning palace in Europe , as it is still used for state functions. Although Spanish monarchs once occupied it, the current King of Spain does not, instead living at the much smaller Palace of Zarzuela.\n\nAlthough notably smaller than several other palaces throughout the world, with only of floorspace, the Royal Palace of Stockholm also claims to be \"the largest palace in the world still used for its original purpose.\" Yet, like the Royal Palace of Madrid, it is not currently occupied, with Swedish monarchs instead occupying Drottningholm Palace.\n\nWhile numerous claimants under the various measurements can be recognized, to be considered for the Guinness World Record the palace must have once been intended for use as a royal residence. This is controversial as the definition of a palace is the official residence of a sovereign, chief of state (as a monarch or a president), archbishop, bishop. Furthermore, only the combined area of all floors in the palace (a measurement commonly known as floorspace) is considered.\n\nAccording to the Guinness World Records, the Forbidden City in Beijing, China is the \"largest palace in the world\". The Istana Nurul Iman, with of floorspace, holds the title as the \"world's largest residential palace\".\n\nIn ancient times palace buildings could be as large or even larger than existing palace buildings. One example is\nthe palace of Knossos on Greek island Crete. This palace, which started construction in 2000 BC, reached its biggest size in 1500 BC with a size of 20,000 square meters (215,278.208 square feet) and 1,300 rooms.\n\nThe Roman emperor Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, Italy was a complex of over 30 buildings build between 118 and the 130s AD, covering an area of at least 250 acres (1 mio square meters, or 10,763,910 square feet) of which much is still unexcavated. The villa was the greatest Roman example of an Alexandrian garden, recreating a sacred landscape. The complex included palaces, several thermae, theatre, temples, libraries, state rooms, and quarters for courtiers, praetorians, and slaves.\n\nWhen Roman emperor Nero's \"Golden House\" (Domus Aurea) was built after the great fire of AD 64, the buildings covered up to 300 acres (1,214,056 square meters, or 13,067,990 square feet). The main villa of the complex had more than 300 rooms.\n"}
