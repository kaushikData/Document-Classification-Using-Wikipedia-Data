The group hosts an annual awards show. Its director is the western publisher Bobby Newton.\nIn 1996, the academy began making annual awards at a gathering in Fort Worth, Texas, specifically to recognize the performers and artisans active in the contemporary cowboy and western movement. The awards have been received by more than 500 individuals in a variety of categories.R.W. Hampton received the first Will Rogers Awards, named for the cowboy humorist Will Rogers. He was both \"Male Vocalist of the Year\" and \"Entertainer of the Year\" in 1996. A year later, Hampton's album, \"Ridin' The Dreamland Range\", was honored as the association's Album of the Year. Hampton won \"Male Vocalist of the Year\" again in 1999, 2002, and 2006.\n\nThe 2011 winner, honored early in 2012 at the 16th annual awards presentation, include Bruce Pollock (radio disc jockey), Henry Real Bird and Bette Wolf Duncan (poetry books, \"Horse Tracks\" and \"Dakota\", respectively), The Nugents (young artists), Syd Masters (male singer), and Mary Kaye (female singer), Jimmy Burson and Joni Harms (Western swing), Stardust Cowboys (Western album \"Riding Back to You\"), Curtis Potter (Country album, \"The Potter's Touch\"), and B.

He was considered one of the most important poets of Yugoslavia. He took part in World War II in Yugoslavia (1941–45) and his poems written at the time were published as \"Pesni\" (Poems) in Belgrade and Kumanovo in 1944, and in Štip the following year. \"Pesni\" was the first poetry collection published in the Macedonian language in SR Macedonia after the war.\n\nŠopov was member of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (1967) and corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (1968).\n\nHe graduated from the philosophy department of the University in Skopje and the Higher Political School in Belgrade. He was president of the Translators’ Union and the Writers’ Union of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia in the 1950s and 1960s, and of the Writers’ Union of Yugoslavia from 1965 to 1969. From 1970 to 1977 he was a diplomat.\n\nHis childhood was haunted by the specter of incurable disease, death, sadness, and loneliness - themes that would later permeate his poetry. He referred to his youth as the \"Hundred-headed monster.\" When he was just eleven years old, his mother, whom he had cared for alone, died prematurely of a serious illness . He began writing poetry in a school notebook at the age of fourteen.\n\nIn 1943, at the age of 19, Aco Šopov became engaged in the Yugoslav Partisans' resistance to the Nazi occupying forces. He continued writing poetry during this period and found his subject matter in his own experience. He proved to be a highly personal poet even when chronicling events of a social or patriotic nature, as when describing the death of a much-loved woman and fellow partisan, Vera Jocić.\n\nWith his poetry book \"Stihovi na makata i radosta\" (Verses of Suffering and Joy), Šopov moved away from socialist realism. Because of this departure in the early 1950s, Šopov's poetry was initially criticized but came to be recognized several years later.\n\nSpeaking with his own voice, Šopov charted his own course in poetry, without being a dissident. \"The greatest challenge and the greatest moral responsibility of the poet,\" he said in an interview, \"is to find the right words to the contents and ideas he wants to express in an authentic and inimitable way. If it fails, the poem is pulled out of its socket, the word becomes a lie.\"\n\nIn 1967, Aco Šopov became one of the founding members of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and was awarded with the AVNOJ in 1970. The AVNOJ Prize is the highest recognition in the area of science and art in the frames of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nIn 1971, after many years of journalism and publishing, Aco Šopov was nominated as the Yugoslav Ambassador to Senegal. Šopov's time in Senegal inspired the book \"Poem for the black women\", which won the Miladinov Brothers Prize at the Struga Poetry Evenings in 1976. This international festival, held each year in the South of Macedonia, was founded in 1961 by Šopov himself with a group of Macedonian poets.\n\nIn 1975, back from Senegal, Aco Šopov was appointed as President of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the Republic of Macedonia. However, just three years later, the disease foreshadowed in his poems forced him to retire from active life. Following a long illness, he died on 20 April 1982 in Skopje.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43506", "title": "Axis of evil", "text": "Axis of evil\n\nThe phrase \"axis of evil\" was first used by U.S. President George W. Bush in his State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, and often repeated throughout his presidency, to describe foreign governments that, during his administration, sponsored terrorism and sought weapons of mass destruction. The notion of such an axis was used to pinpoint these common enemies of the United States and rally the American populace in support of the War on Terror.\n\nIn his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush called North Korea \"A regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.\" He also stated Iran \"aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.\" Of the three nations Bush cited, however, he gave the most criticism to Iraq. He stated \"Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.\" Afterwards, Bush said, \"States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.\"\n\nThe phrase was attributed to former Bush speechwriter David Frum, originally as the \"axis of hatred\" and then \"evil\". Frum explained his rationale for creating the phrase \"axis of evil\" in his book \"The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush\". Essentially, the story begins in late December 2001 when head speechwriter Michael Gerson gave Frum the assignment of articulating the case for dislodging the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in only a few sentences for the upcoming State of the Union address. Frum says he began by rereading President Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"date which will live in infamy\" speech given on December 8, 1941, after the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. While Americans needed no convincing about going to war with Japan, Roosevelt saw the greater threat to the United States coming from Nazi Germany, and he had to make the case for fighting a two-ocean war.\n\nFrum points in his book to a now often-overlooked sentence in Roosevelt's speech which reads in part, \"...we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger us again.\" Frum interprets Roosevelt's oratory like this: \"For FDR, Pearl Harbor was not only an attack—it was a warning of future and worse attacks from another, even more dangerous enemy.\" Japan, a country with one-tenth of America's industrial capacity, a dependence on imports for its food, and already engaged in a war with China, was extremely reckless to attack the United States, a recklessness \"that made the Axis such a menace to world peace\", Frum says. Saddam Hussein's two wars, against Iran and Kuwait, were just as reckless, Frum decided, and therefore presented the same threat to world peace.\n\nIn his book Frum relates that the more he compared the Axis powers of World War II to modern \"terror states\", the more similarities he saw. \"The Axis powers disliked and distrusted one another\", Frum writes. \"Had the Axis somehow won the war, its members would quickly have turned on one another.\" Iran, Iraq, al-Qaeda, and Hezbollah, despite quarreling among themselves, \"all resented power of the West and Israel, and they all despised the humane values of democracy.\" There, Frum saw the connection: \"Together, the terror states and the terror organizations formed an axis of hatred against the United States.\"\n\nFrum tells that he then sent off a memo with the above arguments and also cited some of the atrocities perpetrated by the Iraqi government. He expected his words to be chopped apart and altered beyond recognition, as is the fate of much presidential speechwriting, but his words were ultimately read by Bush nearly verbatim, though Bush changed the term \"axis of hatred\" to \"axis of evil\". North Korea was added to the list, he says, because it was attempting to develop nuclear weapons, had a history of reckless aggression, and \"needed to feel a stronger hand\".\n\nAfterwards, Frum's wife disclosed his authorship to the public.\n\nA decade before the 2002 State of the Union address, in August 1992, the Israeli-American political scientist Yossef Bodansky wrote a paper entitled \"Tehran, Baghdad & Damascus: The New Axis Pact\" while serving as the Director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare of the US House of Representatives. Although he did not explicitly apply the epithet \"evil\" to his New Axis, Bodansky's axis was otherwise very reminiscent of Frum's axis. Bodansky felt that this new Axis was a very dangerous development. The gist of Bodansky's argument was that Iran, Iraq and Syria had formed a \"tripartite alliance\" in the wake of the First Gulf War, and that this alliance posed an imminent threat that could only be dealt with by invading Iraq a second time and overthrowing Saddam Hussein.\n\nOn May 6, 2002, then-Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton gave a speech entitled \"Beyond the Axis of Evil\". In it he added three more nations to be grouped with the already mentioned rogue states: Cuba, Libya, and Syria. The criteria for inclusion in this grouping were: \"state sponsors of terrorism that are pursuing or who have the potential to pursue weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or have the capability to do so in violation of their treaty obligations.\"\n\nIran and Iraq fought the long Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s under basically the same leadership as that which existed at the time of Bush's speech, leading some to believe that the linking of the nations under the same banner was misguided. Others argued that each of the three nations in the \"axis of evil\" had some special characteristics which were obscured by grouping them together. Anne Applebaum wrote about the debate over North Korea's inclusion in the group.\n\nIn the days after the 9/11 attacks, Ryan Crocker, the American Ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009 (then a senior State Department official), and other senior U.S. State Department officials flew to Geneva to meet secretly with representatives of the government of Iran. For several months, Crocker and his Iranian counterparts cooperated on capturing Al Qaeda operatives in the region and fighting the Taliban government in Afghanistan. These meetings stopped after the \"Axis of Evil\" speech hardened Iranian attitudes toward cooperating with the U.S.\n\nIn January 2006, Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz implicated \"the axis of terror that operates between Iran and Syria\" following a suicide bomb in Tel Aviv.\n\nIn April 2006 the phrase \"axis of terror\" earned more publicity. Israel's UN Ambassador, Dan Gillerman, cautioned of a new \"axis of terror\"—Iran, Syria and the Hamas-run Palestinian government; Gillerman repeated the term before the UN over the crisis in Lebanon. Some three months later Israeli senior foreign ministry official Gideon Meir branded the alleged alliance an \"axis of terror and hate\".\n\nIn 2006, Isaias Afewerki, the president of Eritrea, had declared in response to the deteriorating relations with the neighboring countries of Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen by accusing them of being an \"Axis of Belligerence.\"\n\nThe former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, described the so-called New Latin Left as an \"axis of good\" comprising Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela and instead \"Washington and its allies\" as an \"axis of evil\".\n\nIn 2008, \"The Economist\" featured an article about the \"Axis of Diesel\" in reference to a burgeoning alliance of Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. They cite the billions of dollars in arms sales to Venezuela and the construction of Iranian nuclear facilities as well as the rejection of added sanctions on Iran. They did conclude that the benefits of the arrangement were exaggerated, however.\n\nFrom 2010 onward, the term \"Axis of Resistance\" has been used to describe an anti-Western and anti-Israeli alliance between Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, Iraqi Shia militias, and the Houthis.\n\nIn 2012, geo-strategist and author, William C. Martel, in a short essay for the publication, The Diplomat, wrote of an \"Authoritarian Axis\", comprising China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria & Venezuela. Following the death of Venezuela's Hugo Chávez in 2013, Martell removed Venezuela from the assigned list of countries, in his subsequent writings about the \"axis\". Martel's thesis drew criticism from several quarters, with the main arguments cited in opposition to his idea being the lack of cohesion and generally low levels of cooperation shown between the cited countries.\n\nSeveral environmental non-governmental organizations, including Friends of the Earth International and Greenpeace, as well as the Green Party of Canada, have dubbed Australia, Canada and United States, the \"Axis of Environmental Evil\" because of their lack of support for international environmental agreements, particularly those related to climate change.\n\nDuring a March 2018 interview with the Egyptian media, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman referred Iran, Turkey and Islamist organizations such as ISIL and the Muslim Brotherhood as the \"triangle of evil\", to describe their current policies in the Middle East. Those remarks were later dismissed by Iran, describing it as \"childish\" and said that Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen has \"caused instability and extremism and stuck in a quagmire\" in Yemen.\n\nIn November 2018, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton referred to Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua as a \"troika of tyranny\" in Latin America.\n\nVarious related pun phrases include:\n\nThe term has also lent itself to various parodies, including the following:\n\nBritish Comedian Bill Bailey also referred to the Axis of Evil in his Part Troll tour. He queried whether it was possible to assume a non-evil role within a terrorist organisation, possibly in the laundry or catering department. He then went on to pretend that he was the receptionist for the Axis of Evil. Imagining he was answering the phone, Bill Bailey says to the audience, \"Hello, Axis of Evil. Oh no, they're all out at the moment. Oh, I don't know. Doing something evil I suppose\". Placing the \"caller\" on hold, he then played a short jingle for the \"Axis of Evil Pension Scheme\".\n\nIn response to the problems Americans of Middle-Eastern descent have in the current climate, a group of comedians have banded together to form the \"Axis of Evil Comedy Tour\". The comedians, Ahmed Ahmed (from Egypt), Maz Jobrani (from Iran), and Aron Kader (whose father is Palestinian), have created a show which aired on Comedy Central. They have also included half-Palestinian, half-Italian Dean Obeidallah in some of their acts.\n\nThe group took the comedy tour around the Middle East (November - December 2007), performing in the UAE, Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan, and Lebanon to sell-out crowds.\n\nIn 2003 the Norwegian record label Kirkelig Kulturverksted published the CD \"Lullabies from the Axis of Evil\" containing 14 lullabies from Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Palestine, Syria, Afghanistan and Cuba. Every lullaby is presented in its original form sung by women from these countries, and then a western version with interpretations in English.\n\n\nIn cosmology, the \"axis of evil\" is the pattern that is left imprinted on the radiation left behind by the Big Bang.\n\n\n"}

Ferdo Šišić called the Braničevci and Timočani \"Dacian-Slavic tribes\" (dačko-slovenska plemena). They were conquered by the Bulgarian Khan Krum in 805 AD together with the Timočani and Obodrites. The Khan annexed the territories that would serve as a frontier to Rascia and the Franks, he replaced their leaders with Bulgarian administrators. In 818 during the rule of Omurtag (814-836) Braničevci, together with other tribes of the frontier, revolted because of an administrative reform that deprived them of much of their local authority and seceded from Bulgaria. They came under Frankish rule in 822. Timok and Branicevo would be of dispute between the Franks and Bulgars, the Khan sent embassies in 824 and 826 seeking to settle the border dispute, but was neglected.

In response to this attack, a group of concerned citizens founded the Amici degli Uffizi in Florence to help restore and preserve the artistic heritage of the museum. Since the bombing, the Amici degli Uffizi has supported the Uffizi Gallery by facilitating acquisitions, supporting restorations, and organizing special temporary exhibitions.\n\nIn 2006, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery, Inc. was established in Palm Beach, Florida as the United States “sister” organization to the Amici degli Uffizi.

The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi funded the re-construction of this room on the second floor and the re-installation of the paintings. The re-construction involved restoring the original marble floor and re-plastering the walls and painting them red. \nThe re-installation included Michelangelo’s \"Tondo Doni\" (ca. 1507 oil and tempera on panel) which is the only confirmed panel painting existing today in its original frame. \nOther early sixteenth-century Florentine painters represented in the room include Francesco Granacci, Fra Bartolomeo (Paolo di Jacopo del Fattorino detto Baccio della Porta), Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio, Giuliano Bugiardini, and Alonso Berruguete.\n\nLaocoön by Baccio Bandinelli (Firenze 1493-1560), depicts the Trojan priest Laocoön and his two sons ensnared in the toils of the sea serpents sent by Poseidon.

The new restoration improved on the previous one plus removed layers of dust and wax that had built up over the decades and caused the sculpture’s surface to become dull and darkened. This restoration will protect the beauty and condition of this sculpture for many generations.\n\nThese two projects are examples of restorations funded by a single Leonardo-level member of the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery.\n\nThe restoration of this late 2nd Century A.D. replica of a 5th Century B.C. Greek sculpture of Asclepius, the god of medicine, made it possible to confirm the pertinence of the head to the body. In addition to strengthening the sculpture by replacing old putty, recent cleaning of the surface revealed details from an early 12th Century restoration such as the figure’s left hand holding a medicinal plant well known since the Middle Ages. This restoration was funded by the Lisa Marie Conte Browne Family.\n\nThis mid-2nd Century A.D. statue of Aphrodite & Eros is a replica of the original Capitoline Venus, apart from the addition of the small funerary Eros. The sculpture’s head, arms and right leg were integrated in 1584. The sculpture is likely to have never been restored since then and the recent restoration included removing the dirt deposits and addressing the ancient integrations and fractures repairs. This restoration was funded by Thomas J. and Judith A. Embrescia.\n\nWith this type of project, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery accepts donations from all sources (including non-members) interested in conserving a selected work of art.\n\nThe 2014 project is a statue of Aphrodite (2nd Century AD). She is the Greek goddess of love, known as Venus to the Romans. This sculpture is a standing semi-nude female figure created using the ancient Roman fragments of the torso and head.

Due to poor health during early childhood, he studied at first with a private tutor. He continued his studies in Bologna, where he studied under Francesco Saverio Quadrio, and later in Padua, where he studied under Domenico Lazzarini, where he graduated in 1728. In the same year, he married Barbara Chizzoli, an heiress whose dowry allowed him to devote himself to historical studies. Mazzucchelli's father bought the Moggi's sixteenth-century family house, located between Brescia and Lake Garda, in 1722, and added the central building and the west wing some time later. Giammaria completed the construction in 1753, as stated on the memorial tablet set between the pronaos' central door architrave and the tympanum.\n\nHe began with numerous scholarly and accurate biographies of ancient and more modern authors, e.g., Archimedes, Pietro Aretino, Lodovico Adimari, Alamanni Luigi, Matteo and Filippo Villani). From this experience, he conceived an ambitious plan to collect biographies of all the writers of Italy from the earliest times, including the history of their works. In this endeavor, he relied on the Queriniana library in Brescia, donated by the Cardinal Angelo Maria Quirini, and his extensive correspondence with the scholars of Italy and Europe. He began to compile a dictionary of great writers of Italy, but the work remained unfinished because of his untimely death. However, Mazzuchelli opened the way to the history of Italian literature, recognized by Girolamo Tiraboschi in the Introduction of his greatest work, and subsequent historians. Much of Mazzuchelli's unpublished material is still in manuscript form in the Vatican Library. A copy is also in the collection of the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma.\n\n"}

Construction of the mill building in brick and stone was completed by June 1780, and the reported death of a young man attempting to climb on the water wheel suggests that it was operational at this date. After initially investigating the purchase of a steam engine from the Birmingham firm of Boulton and Watt, Arkwright installed a reciprocating steam engine, probably manufactured by Francis Thompson of Ashover, to supplement the occasionally inadequate water supply. This was a medium-sized engine with a beam, an flywheel a cylinder and a stroke of . Similar to engines commonly used at the time to pump out nearby mines, it operated 24 hours a day, powering two pumps.\n\nBy 1789 the mill was employing almost 200 people, but it was sold by Arkwright three years later.

Historic objects in Canada may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the federal government, the provincial governments, or a municipal government.\nThe Heritage Canada Foundation acts as Canada's lead advocacy organization for heritage buildings and landscapes.\n\nThere are a number of heritage designations at the federal level for historic sites in Canada:\n\nThe federal government also operates related programs for the recognition of historic persons (National Historic Persons) and events (National Historic Events).\n\nEach provincial government has distinct systems and approaches to heritage conservation. They may delegate the authority to preserve historic buildings to municipalities, and / or have a provincial heritage register.\n\nFor example, in the province of Alberta, only sites owned by the provincial government and run as a functioning historic site or museum are known as Provincial Historic Sites or Provincial Historic Areas. Buildings and sites owned by private citizens and companies or other levels or branches of government may gain one of two levels of historic designation, \"Registered Historic Resource\" or \"Provincial Historic Resource\". Historic designation in Alberta is governed by the Historic Resources Act. The province also lists buildings deemed historically significant by municipal governments on the Alberta Register of Historic Places, which is also part of the larger Canadian Register of Historic Places although this does not imply provincial or federal government status or protection. To supplement this system, the province also run the Alberta Main Street Program which helps to preserve historic buildings in the downtowns of smaller communities. The basis for the preservation system in Alberta is the Heritage Survey Program, which is a survey of 80,000 historic buildings in Alberta which lack a protected status but are documented for possible future protection.\n\nIn Quebec, the Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec is the main heritage register, it includes both protected and unprotected properties. The Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec is a non-profit organization created in 1995 to promote the conservation of churches and other religious heritage buildings in the province.\n\nCities, towns, counties and other local government in Canada may use zoning and other bylaws to restrict the demolition of individual historic buildings or districts. They may maintain a municipal heritage register, such as Edmonton's \"Register of Historic Resources in Edmonton\". The city of Vancouver uses a traditional heritage register and a new system called a density bank, under which developers are rewarded for preserving and restoring heritage buildings by being awarded exceptions to restrictions (usually height restrictions) on other sites they own.\n\nIn Montreal, one of Canada's oldest and most historically rich cities, the Le Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal advises the municipal government on matters related to heritage building preservation. A pair of non-governmental groups have worked to preserve Montreal historic buildings since the 1970s: Save Montreal, co-founded by Michael Fish in 1974, and Heritage Montreal, founded by Phyllis Lambert two years later. In October 2009, Lambert, Heritage Montreal and others formed a think tank called the Institut de politiques alternatives de Montréal to advise the city on a range of matters including urban planning, development and heritage.\n\nTwo of the primary conservation tools in Canada are the Canadian Register of Historic Places and the \"Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada\". This document was the result of a major collaborative effort among federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, heritage conservation professionals, heritage developers and many individual Canadians. A pan–Canadian collaboration, it is intended to reinforce the development of a culture of conservation in Canada, which will continue to find a unique expression in each of the jurisdictions and regions of the country. In the document, conservation approaches are broken down into three categories: Preservation, Rehabilitation, and Restoration. As published in the \"Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada\", these conservation approaches are defined as follows:\n\nPreservation: the action or process of protecting, maintaining, and/or stabilizing the existing materials, form, and integrity of a historic place or of an individual component, while protecting its heritage value. Preservation can include both short-term and interim measures to protect or stabilize the place, as well as long-term actions to retard deterioration or prevent damage so that the place can be kept serviceable through routine maintenance and minimal repair, rather than extensive replacement and new construction.\n\nRehabilitation: the action or process of making possible a continuing or compatible contemporary use of a historic place or an individual component, through repair, alterations, and/ or additions, while protecting its heritage value.\n\nRestoration: the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic place or of an individual component, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value.\n\n"}

This quarter was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982.\n\nBuilt on the site of an Etruscan settlement, Florence, the symbol of the Renaissance, rose to economic and cultural pre-eminence under the Medici in the 15th and 16th centuries. Its 600 years of extraordinary artistic activity can be seen above all in the 13th-century cathedral (Santa Maria del Fiore), the Church of Santa Croce, the Uffizi and the Pitti Palace, the work of great masters such as Giotto, Brunelleschi, Botticelli and Michelangelo.\n\nClosed inside the avenues traced on the old medieval walls, the historic centre of Florence collects the city's most important cultural heritage sites. Delimited by the 14th century wall circuit, built thanks to the economic and commercial power reached at the time, knew its maximum splendor in the following two centuries.\n\nSpiritual center of the city is Piazza del Duomo with the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, flanked by Giotto's Campanile and facing the Baptistry of Saint John with the 'Gates of Paradise' by Lorenzo Ghiberti. From here to the north there are the Palazzo Medici Riccardi by Michelozzo, the Basilica of Saint Lawrence by Filippo Brunelleschi, with the precious sacristies of Donatello and Michelangelo. Furthermore, the Museum of San Marco with masterpieces by Fra Angelico, the Accademia Gallery which houses among other works the David by Michelangelo (1501–1504), and the Piazza della Santissima Annunziata with the Loggia of the Innocenti by Filippo Brunelleschi.\n\nHeading south from the Duomo there is the political and cultural center of Florence with Palazzo Vecchio and the Uffizi Gallery nearby, near which are the Bargello Museum and the Basilica of the Holy Cross. Crossing the Ponte Vecchio we arrive at the Oltrarno district with the Pitti Palace and the Boboli Gardens. Still in Oltrarno, there are the Basilica of the Holy Spirit by Filippo Brunelleschi and the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine, with frescoes by Masolino, Masaccio and Filippino Lippi.\n\nIn the area west of the Duomo is situated the imposing palace Palazzo Strozzi (home of major exhibitions and cultural institutions) and the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, with the facade designed by Leon Battista Alberti.\n\nThe old town can be appreciated in its entirety from the surrounding hills, especially from Forte Belvedere, from the Piazzale Michelangelo with the Romanesque Basilica of San Miniato al Monte and the hills of Fiesole, which offers one of the most beautiful views of the Arno valley.\n\nThe northern part of the old town is surrounded by the avenues of Viali di Circonvallazione, a series of large six-lane avenues inspired by Parisian boulevard created when Florence was the capital of Italy.\n\nThe center of Florence, with its hundreds of business activities is a paradise for shopping and entertainment: elegant boutiques, historic cafes, the lively street markets, as well as hosting numerous nightclubs, discos, American-bar and meeting places for a drink (the famous Negroni cocktail was born here).\n\nIn 1982 ICOMOS proposed the historic centre of Florence as a candidate World Heritage Site.\n\n"}

{"id": "29540786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29540786", "title": "Homeland Security Grant Program", "text": "Homeland Security Grant Program\n\nHomeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) is a program in the United States established in 2003 and was designated to incorporate all projects that provide funding to local, state, and Federal government agencies by the Department of Homeland Security. The purpose of the grants is to purchase surveillance equipment, weapons, and advanced training for law enforcement personnel in order to heighten security. The HSGP helps fulfill one of the core missions of the Department of Homeland Security by enhancing the country's ability to prepare for, prevent, respond to and recover from potential attacks and other hazards. The HSGP is one of the main mechanisms in funding the creation and maintenance of national preparedness, which refers to the establishment of plans, procedures, policies, training, and equipment at the Federal, State, and local level that is needed to maximize the ability to prevent, respond to, and recover from major events such as terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. The HSGP's creation stemmed from the consolidation of six original projects that were previously funded by the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness. The HSGP now encompasses five projects in the program: State Homeland Security Program, Urban Areas Security Initiative, Operation Stonegarden, Metropolitan Medical Response System Program, and Citizen Corps Program. During the 2010 fiscal year, the Department of Homeland Security will spend $1,786,359,956 on the Homeland Security Grant Program.\n\nAs stated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, these four areas of mission-supporting responsibilities are what drive the Homeland Security Grant Program:\n\nThe HSGP encompasses three projects with over $1 billion in funding available for FY 2017: the State Homeland Security Program ($402 million), the Urban Areas Security Initiative ($580 million), Operation Stonegarden ($55 million). The HSGP previously included other projects, including the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program and Citizen Corps, but beginning in 2012, these projects were no longer part of the HSGP.\n\nThis grant program offers a total of $402 million to enhance the state and local levels' ability to implement the goals and objectives of each state's individual preparedness report, which is one of the first steps in moving the grant processes, programs, and planning from a focus on loosely affiliated equipment, training, exercises and technical assistance projects to one that delivers a picture of prevention, protection, response and recovery capacity. In correspondence with the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-53) (9/11 Act), states receiving funding are legally required to ensure that at least 25 percent of the appropriated funds are dedicated to the planning, organization, training, exercise and equipment necessary for terrorism prevention. Additionally, SHSP funds may be used to facilitate secure identification including REAL ID, enhanced driver's licenses, Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC), and first responder credentialing. Only those items specified on the \"authorized equipment list\" are eligible to be purchased by SHSP funding. Authorized items fall into the following 18 categories: personal protective equipment (fully encapsulated liquid and vapor protection ensemble, chemical resistant gloves, etc.) explosive device mitigation and remediation equipment (ballistic threat body armor, real-time x-ray unit, etc.), chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosive (CBRNE) search and rescue equipment (rescue ropes and ladder, confined space kits, etc.), interoperable communications equipment (personal alert safety system, antenna and tower systems, etc.), detection equipment (M-8 detection paper for chemical agent identification, photo-ionization detector, etc.), decontamination equipment (decontamination litters/roller systems, high efficiency particulate air vacuum, etc.), physical security enhancement equipment (motion detector systems, radar systems, etc.), terrorism incident prevention equipment (joint regional information exchange system, law enforcement surveillance equipment, etc.), CBRNE logistical support equipment (equipment trailers, handheld computers for emergency response applications, etc.), CBRNE incident response vehicles (hazardous materials vehicles, mobile morgue unit, etc.) medical supplies and limited types of pharmaceuticals (automatic biphasic external defibrillators and carry bags, epinephrine, etc.) CBRNE reference materials (National Fire Protection Association guide to hazardous materials, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health hazardous materials pocket guide, etc.), agricultural terrorism prevention, response and mitigation equipment (animal restraints, blood sampling supplies, etc.), CBRNE response watercraft (surface boats and vessels for port homeland security purposes), CBRNE aviation equipment (fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, etc.), cyber security enhancement equipment (firewall and authentication technologies, geographic information systems, etc.), intervention equipment (tactical entry equipment, specialized response vehicles and vessels, etc.), and other authorized equipment (installation costs for authorized equipment, shipping costs of equipment, etc.).\n\nThe Urban Areas Security Initiative program makes $580 million available to enhance regional preparedness in major metropolitan areas throughout the United States. The UASI program directly supports expanding regional collaboration and is meant to assist participants in their creation of regional systems for prevention, protection, response, and recovery. Again, in correspondence with the 9/11 Act, states are required to ensure that at least 25 percent of appropriated funding is dedicated to terrorism prevention planning, organization, training, exercise, and equipment. State Administrative Agencies (Department of Public Safety, State Office of Homeland Security, Emergency Management Agency, etc.) are the only groups eligible to apply directly to FEMA for UASI grants.\n\nThe Recipients of the UASI program include the 64 highest risk Urban Areas in the country, which are divided into the 10 highest risk areas (Tier 1) and the remaining 54 areas (Tier 2). These areas are determined by the DHS by examining the relative risk of the 100 most populous Metropolitan Statistical Areas defined by the Office of Management and Budget. Relative risk is determined in a three-step process that analyzes urban areas and states based on threat, vulnerability and consequence measurements, an effectiveness assessment of applicants’ investment justifications, and then the final allocation decision.\n\nThe intent of this $55 million program is to enhance coordination among local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to secure the borders with Mexico, Canada, and international waters. OPSG is intended to support U.S. border States and territories in increasing the nation's capability to handle border security issues, emphasizing the role of local operational groups in enhancing National and State Homeland Security (such as the Federal Secure Borders Initiative and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) strategies), increasing collaboration among all the levels of law enforcement agencies, continuing the enhancements required for border security, providing intelligence-based operations through U.S. Customs and Border Protection experts to ensure safety and operational oversight of law enforcement agencies participating in the projects operation, supporting the activation, deployment, or redeployment of specialized National Guard Units, Packages and elements of State law enforcement to enhance operational activities, and continuing to increase readiness of all law enforcement agencies. Those eligible for OPSG funding are local units of government at the county level and federally recognized tribal governments in the states bordering Canada, Mexico or those with international water borders. Allocations of funds, received from the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 (Public Law 110-83), are based on a risk-based prioritization by U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s sector-specific border risk methodology, which include \"threat, vulnerability, miles of border and other border-specific law enforcement intelligence.\" On July 15, 2010, Secretary Napolitano announced that 80 percent of Operation Stonegarden funding will now be directed to Southwest border states, and tribal funding will be increased by $8.2 million to $10 million in FY 2010.\n\nIn 2011, the Metropolitan Medical Response System program made $34.9 million available for the integration of emergency management, health, and medical systems into an organized response to mass casualty incidents such as nuclear, biological or chemical terrorist incidents. Successful MMRS grantees will be provided with the necessary resources to reduce the potential costs of a mass casualty incident during the initial stages of an incident by having proper coordinated response systems, such as equipment and supplies procurement, emergency triage and pre-hospital treatment/emergency medical services, hospital evacuation, patient tracking, etc. already in place. Aside from the typical local, regional and state emergency response agencies, the MMRS also includes facets of response such as disaster medical assistance teams and disaster mortuary operational response teams that may be federalized in disaster situations. The program created 124 local MMRS jurisdictions, in which the $39.36 million budget is distributed evenly. The 124 jurisdictions are encouraged to collaborate closely with local, regional, and State health and medical partners, such as Medical Reserve Corps Units, Citizen Corps Councils, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the Center for Disease Control's Cities Readiness Initiative, and Strategic National Stockpile programs.\n\nIn 2011, the Citizen Corps made $9.98 million in grant funding available for integrating the community and government to better coordinate local involvement in the preparation, planning, mitigation, response and recovery stages of emergencies. The main mission of the Citizen Corps is to utilize every resource by means of education, training, and volunteer service to local security and readiness to respond to threats of terror, crime, health issues, and disasters. CCP allocations are determined using the USA PATRIOT Act formula, which specifies that each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will receive a minimum of 75 percent of the total available grant funding. This leaves the remaining 25 percent of the total available grant funding to be allocated to the four territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The balance of CCP funds are to be distributed on a population-share basis among all of the recipients.\n\nSome criticism of the Homeland Security Grant Program has come from the distribution of funds. Not unlike other federal funding programs, the HSGP distributes a portion of funding based on population and distributes the remainder of funding evenly. For its part, the HSGP distributes 60% of funds on the basis of population, and the other 40% is evenly spread across all recipients regardless of population. Wyoming for instance, despite being the least populous state, received more funding per capita in homeland security grants than any other state in 2004. At $45.22 per citizen of the state, Wyoming received more than four times the amount of funding per citizen given to either California or New York.\nAnother criticism has come from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in regards to the risk-based grant methodology. Although the GAO concluded that the overall risk-based methodology (threat, vulnerability and consequences) was reasonable, the absence of a proper way to measure variations in vulnerability greatly reduce the value of the vulnerability portion of the assessment. Ultimately, they concluded that the vulnerability measure as part of its risk analysis model should be amended to better capture variations in vulnerability across the different states and urban areas it assesses.\n\n\n\n"}

Her family name \"Elmasry\" in the Arabic language means The Egyptian.\n\nHer father Habib Elmasry was the secretary of the General Congregation Council of the Coptic Orthodox Church. She had two brothers; Amin, who was a prominent surgeon, and died in the 1960s, and Sami who was director of the Egyptian State Bureau for Tourism in London, and three sisters; Eva, who helped Iris in her work, Soraya, an avid pianist, and Dora, who was married to Dr Aziz El Masry\n\nHabib Elmasry was the secretary of the General Congregation council for three terms, and was known for his strong support of ordination of a monk to be the Coptic pope and not a metropolitan or a bishop. This issue caused an ongoing dispute in the Coptic Orthodox Church and although The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church had considered in the 1960s the general bishops to be secretaries to the pope in the degree of a bishop, Iris Elmasry in her List of Coptic Orthodox Popes of Alexandria considered Pope Shenouda III (1971–2012), who was a general bishop before, to be the fourth bishop to become a pope after Popes John XIX (1928–1942), Macarius III (1942–1944)and Joseph II (1946–1956).\n\nElmasry received her Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in education from Maria Grey College, University of London in 1932.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1954, she pursued her research at Dropsie College, Philadelphia, and in 1955, she went to the National Gallery, London, to obtain further materials and documents.\n\nIn 1954, Pope Joseph II appointed Elmasry as the female delegate of the Coptic Church to the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Evanston, Illinois, USA.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1985 Elmasry continued to lecture in Coptic History at both the Seminary in Cairo and Alexandria and at the Institute of Coptic Studies.\n\nShe died on July 2, 1994.\n\nElmasry took interest in the history of the Coptic Orthodox Church and in 1948 published the first volume of her nine-volumes book \"Story of the Coptic church\". The seventh volume of this history is about the era of Pope Cyril VI (1959–1971): the book shows how highly appreciative she was of His Holiness's work.\n\nShe considered Abouna Matta El Meskeen the Spiritual Father of the Monks in St. Macarius' Monastery in Scetis (Egypt) as her mentor and always expressed gratitude to him in the introductions to her books and also to father Bishoy Kamel of Alexandria.\n\nPope Youssab II, the 115th Pope (1946–1956), appointed Elmasry in 1954 as his secretary for correspondence with the World Council of Churches. His successor Pope Kyrillos VI, the 116th Pope (1959–1971), appointed her in 1966 as Counselor to young Coptic women.\n\nWhile Elmasry's Arabic language publications are among the most widely quoted in the historical literature of the Coptic Church, her impressive work as a theologian, politician, psychologist, educator, and philanthropist is not as widely known. An article by Saad (2009) presents an introduction to her contributions to certain areas of politics and theology, while exploring in more detail unique features of her writing that may offer a framework for Coptic feminine theology.\n\nElmasry's work was very thorough: she made every effort not to omit details that she considered important. As a result, her work is more detailed, and of greater use to both academic and non-academic readers; is valuable for any researcher in Coptic history and provides a comprehensive approach to the history of Christianity in Egypt and point of view of the Coptic Church regarding many debatable issue like Council of Chalcedon.\n\nIn the introduction to the first volume of her nine volumes book on the history of the Coptic Church, she mentions a conversation she had with a non-Egyptian about Council of Chalcedon, during which she explained the Coptic view regarding the council.\n\nShe used a lot of sources in her work and mentioned many known scripts in different languages. Her work shows clear affection towards her church, and high esteem for certain people in the church’s history. This may be the reason behind the way she presented the history of Pope Cyril III in comparison to the way it was presented in Abouna Menassa Youhanna's book \"History of the Coptic Church\".\n\n\n\n"}

Mackay\n\nJames Alexander Mackay (21 November 1936 – 12 August 2007) was a prolific Scottish writer and philatelist whose output of philatelic works was rivalled only by Fred Melville. He was described by John Holman, editor of the \"British Philatelic Bulletin\", as a \"philatelic writer without equal\" but his reputation was damaged by a conviction for theft from the British Museum early in his career, which cost him his job there, and multiple accusations of plagiarism.\n\nJames Mackay was born in Inverness on 21 November 1936. He was educated in Glasgow where he also attended the university. Later in life Mackay was awarded a Doctor of Literature (D.Litt) degree by Glasgow University.\n\nHe married Renate.\n\nInterested in stamps and the postal system from an early age, he wrote two acclaimed histories of the Scottish posts; one limited to St. Kilda and, in 1978, his \"History of Scottish Postmarks, 1693-1978\", the definitive work on the subject. He became a prolific philatelic author, especially on English, Irish and Scottish postmarks and also produced popular Postal History Annuals and island series books. He wrote some 200 books and at least 10,000 articles. Mackay's interest in the postal history of St Kilda had been formed during his time stationed there during his army service in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1972 Mackay was dismissed from his job as an assistant keeper at the British Museum in London after he was convicted at the Old Bailey of stealing valuable proof stamps. He had pleaded guilty to five charges of stealing progressive proofs on loan from the Crown Agents from the Museum in 1965 and 1966 and was fined £1000. He had exchanged the proofs with dealer Clive Feigenbaum for Winston Churchill themed stamps.\n\nHe was the editor of \"The Burns Chronicle\" from 1976 to 1992 which under his stewardship reached a level of quality and diversity it has not achieved before or since. He then turned to biography, where he was less successful. Through the 1980s he worked on a biography of Robert Burns which was published in 1992 to favourable reviews and which won the Saltire Society Book of the Year Award. Subsequent biographies of Allan Pinkerton and William Wallace received more mixed reviews.\n\n1996 saw the release of \"Michael Collins: A Life\", a work about the life of the famed Irish revolutionary which received excellent reviews.\n\nMackay also wrote books under a number of different pseudonyms including Ian Angus, William Finlay, Bruce Garden, Alex Matheson and Peter Whittington.\n\nIn 1998, he published a biography of Alexander Graham Bell. It was on the market briefly before Robert V. Bruce published a damning indictment, detailing sustained plagiarism of his own work, \"Alexander Graham Bell and the Conquest of Solitude\". Far from being a little-known work, the latter had in fact won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973. The indictment, published in the American Historical Association's house journal, counted instances of plagiarism on 80 percent of the pages published. Mackay paid his publishers to withdraw the book from circulation, and Bruce agreed not to sue.\n\nMackay then published a biography of John Paul Jones, the founder of the US Navy. While initially well received, and the subject of flattering reviews in the trade press, it was soon discovered that it was practically a copy of what those same reviews had marked as the last work on the man, that by Samuel Eliot Morison in 1942. That biography too had won the Pulitzer. Columbia University history professor David Armitage was quoted in the \"New York Times\" as saying that the book was \"a spectacular and sustained act of plagiarism.\"\n\nDespite these accusations, Mackay continued to be commissioned to write articles for the philatelic press and it has been said that almost the entire text of some editions of \"Stamp & Coin Mart\", a popular British magazine, were written by him.\n\nMackay died on 12 August 2007 at the age of 70 in Glasgow.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

H. Kruskall (1975), who specified: \n\nThe role of statistical graphics within statistics generally... has had tremendous ups and downs: at one time, graphical methods were near the core of statistics-Karl Pearson devoted considerable attention to graphics and he was following the emphasis of his hero, Francis Galton.

{"id": "6908822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6908822", "title": "John Michell (writer)", "text": "John Michell (writer)\n\nJohn Frederick Carden Michell (9 February 1933 – 24 April 2009) was an English author and esotericist who was a prominent figure in the development of the Earth mysteries movement. Over the course of his life he published over forty books on an array of different subjects, being a proponent of the Traditionalist school of esoteric thought.\n\nBorn in London to a wealthy family, Michell was educated at Cheam School and Eton College before serving as a Russian translator in the Royal Navy for two years. After failing a degree in Russian and German at Trinity College, Cambridge, he returned to London and worked for his father's property business, there developing his interest in Ufology.\nEmbracing the counter-cultural ideas of the Earth mysteries movement during the 1960s, in \"The Flying Saucer Vision\" he built on Alfred Watkins' ideas of ley lines by arguing that they represented linear marks created in prehistory to guide extraterrestrial spacecraft. He followed this with his most influential work, \"The View Over Atlantis\", in 1969. His ideas were at odds with those of academic archaeologists, for whom he expressed contempt. \nMichell believed in the existence of an ancient spiritual tradition that connected humanity to divinity, but which had been lost as a result of modernity. He believed however that this tradition would be revived and that humanity would enter a Golden Age, with Britain as the centre of this transformation.\n\nMichell's other publications covered an eclectic range of topics, and included an overview on the Shakespeare authorship question, a tract condemning Salman Rushdie during \"The Satanic Verses\" controversy, and a book of Adolf Hitler's quotations. Keenly interested in the crop circle phenomenon, he co-founded a magazine devoted to the subject, \"The Cereologist\", in 1990, and served as its initial editor. From 1992 until his death he wrote a column for \"The Oldie\" magazine, which was largely devoted to his anti-modernist opinions. He accompanied this with a column on esoteric topics for the \"Daily Mirror\" tabloid.\nA lifelong marijuana smoker, Michell died of lung cancer in 2009.\n\nMichell's impact in the Earth mysteries movement was considerable, and through it he also influenced the British Pagan movement. During the 2000s, his ideas also proved an influence on the Radical Traditionalist sector of the New Right.\n\nJohn Frederic Carden Michell was born in London on 9 February 1933. His father, Alfred, was of Cornish descent and worked as a property dealer in the capital, while his mother Enid (née Carden) was the daughter of baronet Sir Frederick Carden. The eldest of three children, Michell's siblings were named Charles and Clare.\nMichell was raised at Stargroves, his maternal grandfather's Victorian-era estate on the Berkshire Downs near to Newbury, and it was here that he developed a love of the countryside, learning about the local flora and fauna from a neighbouring naturalist. He was raised into the Anglican denomination of Christianity, although in later life rejected the religion.\nMichell was initially educated as a boarder at the preparatory Cheam School, where he was Head Boy and excelled at the high jump. From there he went to study at Eton College, where he was a contemporary of Lord Moyne and Ian Cameron, the father of future Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nHe spent his two years of national service in the Royal Navy, during which time he qualified as a Russian translator at the School of Slavonic Studies. He then went on to study Russian and German at Trinity College, Cambridge, although was unable to secure even a third-class degree. He then qualified as a chartered surveyor at a firm in Gloucestershire, before moving back to London to work for his father's property business. Commenting on this job, he later stated that it was \"quite amusing, but of course I wasn't any good at it\", with property speculators eroding much of his fortune.\n\nIn 1966 one of his properties, the basement of his own residence, became the base of the London Free School. The Black Power activist Michael X, having previously run a gambling club in the basement, had now become active in the organisation of the LFS and brought Michell into counter-culture activities. Michell began to offer courses in UFOs and ley lines.\nIn 1964, with Jocasta Innes, Michell fathered a son, Jason Goodwin, who also became a writer. The relationship with Innes did not last. Jason Goodwin did not meet his natural father until 1992, at the age of 28, at which they became quite close.\n\nMichell developed an interest in Ufology and Earth mysteries after attending a talk given by Jimmy Goddard at Kensington Central Library on the subject of \"Leys and Orthonies\" in November 1965. Michell's first publication on the subject of Ufology was the article \"Flying Saucers\", which appeared in the 30 January 1967 edition of the counter-cultural newspaper \"International Times\". He proceeded to write a book on the subject, but lost the original manuscript after accidentally leaving it in a North London café, at which he had to rewrite it. The book eventually saw publication as \"The Flying Saucer Vision\", published in 1967, when Michell was 35 years old.\n\n\"The Flying Saucer Vision\" took the idea of Tony Wedd that ley lines – alleged trackways across the landscape whose existence was first argued by Alfred Watkins – represented markers for the flight of extraterrestrial spacecraft and built on it, arguing that early human society was aided by alien entities who were understood as gods, but that these extraterrestrials had abandoned humanity because of the latter's greed for material and technological development.\nAccording to Lachman, at this time Michell took the view that \"an imminent revelation of literally inconceivable scope\" was at hand, and that the appearance of UFOs was linked to \"the start of a new phase in our history\". Many fans of Michell's work consider it to be \"by far his most impressive book\". In their social history of Ufology, David Clarke and Andy Roberts stated that Michell's work was \"the catalyst and helmsman\" for the growing interest in UFOs among the hippie sector of the counter-culture.\n\nSubsequently, there was a shift in Michell's emphasis as he became increasingly interested in the landscapes in which he believed that ley lines could be found rather than the UFOs themselves. He wrote an article on \"Lung Mei and the Dragon Paths of England\" for a September 1967 issue of \"Image\" magazine, in which he compared British ley-lines to the Chinese mythological idea of \"lung mei\" lines, arguing that this was evidence of a widespread pre-Christian dragon cult in ancient Britain. He built on these ideas for \"The View Over Atlantis\", a book which he privately published in 1969, with a republication following three years later. Believing this earth energy to be a real magnetic phenomenon arising naturally from the ground, Michell argued that an ancient religious-scientific elite had traveled the world constructing the lines and various megalithic monuments in order to channel this energy and direct it for the good of humanity. The tone of his work reflected \"a fervent religious feeling\", describing the existence of an ancient, universal, and true system of belief that was once spread across the ancient world but which had been lost through the degeneracy of subsequent generations. He added however that this ancient knowledge would be revived with the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, allowing for what Michell described as the \"rediscovery of access to the divine will\".\n\nThe Pagan studies scholar Amy Hale stated that \"The View Over Atlantis\" was \"a smash countercultural success\", while the historian Ronald Hutton described it as \"almost the founding document of the modern earth mysteries movement\". Fellow ley-hunter and later biographer Paul Screeton considered it to be a \"groundbreaking\" work which \"re-enchanted the British landscape and empowered a generation to seek out and appreciate the spiritual dimension of the countryside, not least attracting them to reawaken the sleepy town of Glastonbury\". \nThe book inspired an array of Earth Mysteries publications in the 1970s and 1980s, accompanied by growth in the ley-hunting movement. Among the most prominent works to build on Michell's ideas during this period were Janet and Colin Bord's \"Mysterious Britain\", which used them in its presentation of a gazetteer of ancient sites, and Paul Screeton's \"Quicksilver Heritage\", which argued that the Neolithic had been a time devoted to spiritual endeavours which had been corrupted by the emergence of metal technologies. Michell associated with many individuals active in this ley-hunting community, and in July 1971 was one of many attendees at a ley-hunters picnic held at Risbury Camp, the largest outdoor gathering of the movement since 1939.\n\nIn May 1969 Michell established a group known as the Research Into Lost Knowledge Organisation (RILKO) with his friends Keith Critchlow and Mary Williams. In conjunction with the Garnstone Press, RILKO founded the Prehistory and Ancient Science Library, a book series that brought out reprints of older works, such as Watkins' \"The Old Straight Track\" and William Stirling's \"The Canon\", both of which contained forewords by Michell. Michell also founded a small publishing company of his own, West Country Editions, through which he brought out his own \"A Little History of Bladud\" in 1973 as well as a reprint of Howard C. Levis's 1919 book \"Bladud of Bath\". With his friend John \"Peewee\" Michael, who lived in Bristol, Michell also established a second small press, Pentacle Books, although it failed to become a commercial success and was short lived.\n\nMichell was involved in the summer 1971 Glastonbury Fayre music festival near Pilton, Somerset, where the pyramid stage was built to Michell's specifications and situated at what he claimed were the apex of two ley lines. Through Michael Rainey, Michell was introduced to the members of rock band The Rolling Stones at the Courtfield Road home of band member Brian Jones. Michell befriended the band's lead singer, Mick Jagger, and he accompanied the band on a visit to Stonehenge. Michell then went on a visit to Woolhope in Herefordshire with Keith Richards, Anita Pallenberg, Christopher Gibbs, and the filmmaker Kenneth Anger, where they hunted for ley lines and UFOs. Marianne Faithfull later recounted that band member Jones was particularly interested in Michell's ideas. He would later meet with the members of The Grateful Dead on their 1972 European tour; band members Phil Lesh and Jerry Garcia expressed an interest in Michell's Earth Mysteries ideas.\n\nMichell's impact on the hippie subculture was recognised by mainstream media, and he was invited to submit an article titled \"Flying saucers\" to \"The Listener\" in May 1968, which was accompanied by a critical piece by editor Karl Miller, in which Michell was described as \"less a hippy, perhaps, than a hippy's counsellor, one of their junior Merlins.\"\nHale noted that Michell promoted the idea of \"England as a site of spiritual redemption in the New Age\", bringing together \"popular ideas about sacred geometry, Druids, sacred landscapes, earth energies, Atlantis, and UFOs\".\n\nIn 1972 Michell published a sequel to \"The View Over Atlantis\" as \"City of Revelation\". Shortly after publication he stated that he had written the work in \"almost two years of near total solitude and intense study in Bath.\" This work was more complex than its predecessor, including chapters on sacred geometry, numerology, gematria, and the esoteric concept of the New Jerusalem, and required an understanding of mathematics and Classics to follow its arguments. \nBob Rickard, founding editor of \"Fortean Times\", has written that Michell's first three works \"provided a synthesis of and a context for all the other weirdness of the era. It’s fair to say that it played a big part in the foundation of \"Fortean Times\" itself by helping create a readership that wanted more things to think about and a place to discuss them. The overall effect was to help the burgeoning interest in strange phenomena spread out into mainstream culture.\" \n\nThe work of Michell and others in the ley-hunting and Earth mysteries communities were rejected by the professional archaeological establishment, with the prominent British archaeologist Glyn Daniel denouncing what he perceived as the \"lunatic fringe\". In turn, Michell was hostile to professional and academic archaeologists, accusing them of \"treasure hunting and grave robbery\" and viewing them as representations of what he interpreted as the evils of modernity. In response to the academic archaeological community's refusal to take the idea of ley lines seriously, in 1970 Michell offered a challenge for professional archaeologists to disprove his ideas regarding the West Peninsula leys. He stated that were he to be proved wrong then he would donate a large sum to charity, but at the time no one took up his offer.\n\nHowever, in 1983 his case study was analysed by two archaeologists, Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy, as part of their work \"Ley Lines in Question\", a critical analysis of the evidence for ley-lines. They highlighted that Michell had erroneously included medieval crosses and natural features under his definition of late prehistoric monuments, and that arguments for ley-lines more widely could not be sustained. The impact of their work on the ley-hunting community was substantial, with one section moving in a more fully religious direction by declaring that leys could only be detected by intuition, and the other renouncing a ley line belief in favour of a more ethnographically-rooted analysis of linear connections in the landscape. Responding to their work, Michell said that \"I just feel sorry for Williamson and Bellamy that the most exciting thing they can find to do with their youth is to discredit the ley vision.\"\n\nIn 1983 Michell published an altered version of his best known work as \"The New View Over Atlantis\".\n\nIoan Culianu, a specialist in gnosticism and Renaissance esoteric studies, in a review in 1991 of \"The Dimensions of Paradise: The Proportions and Symbolic Numbers in Ancient Cosmology\", expressed the view that, \"After some deliberation the reader of this book will oscillate between two hypotheses: either that many mysteries of the universe are based on numbers, or that the book's author is a fairly learned crank obsessed with numbers.\" \n\nIn 1970, Michell founded the Anti-Metrification Board to oppose the adoption of the metric system of measurement in the United Kingdom. Believing that the established imperial system of measurement had both ancient and sacred origins, through the Board he brought out a newsletter, \"Just Measure\". In 1972 he published the first of his \"Radical Traditionalist Papers\", \"A Defence of Sacred Measures\", in which he laid out his opposition to the metric system.\nIn his third Radical Traditionalist Paper, published in 1973, he argued against population control, critiquing the ideas of Thomas Robert Malthus and arguing that correct use of resources could maintain an ever-growing human population.\nHis fifth Radical Traditionalist Paper, \"Concordance to High Monarchists\", offered Michell's proposed solution to The Troubles of Northern Ireland; in his view, Ireland should be divided into four provinces, each administered separately but all ultimately pledging allegiance to a High King, in this way mirroring what Michell believed was the socio-political organisation of prehistoric Ireland.\n\nFollowing the 1975 execution of Michael X for a murder committed in Trinidad, Michell published a souvenir pamphlet to commemorate the execution, claiming that all royalties from its publication would go to Michael X's widow. In 1976 he published \"The Hip Pocket Hitler\", a book containing those quotations from Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, which Michell deemed to be humorous or insightful, thus seeking to portray a side to Hitler that was more favourable than the dominant paradigm. In 1979 he provided an introduction to a translation of Pliny the Elder's \"Inventorum Natura\", which had been illustrated by Una Woodruff. That same year he brought out \"Simulcra\", a work in which he examined perceived faces in natural forms such as trees. In collaboration with Bob Rickard, in 1977 Michell published \"Phenomena: A Book of Wonders\", an encyclopedic work devoted to paranormal and fortean phenomena which covered such topics as UFOs, werewolves, lake monsters, and spontaneous human combustion. They followed this with a second encyclopedic volume, \"Living Wonders: Mysteries and Curiosities of the Animal World\", which appeared in 1982 and was devoted to fortean topics involving animals, with much of it focusing on cryptozoological topics.\n\nIn 1984 he published \"Eccentric Lives and Peculiar Notions\", in which he provided brief biographies of various figures whose ideas had been rejected by mainstream scholarship and society, among them Nesta Webster, Iolo Morganwg, Brinsley Le Poer Trench, and Comyns Beaumont. In \"Euphonics: A Poet's Dictionary of Sounds\" he then argued that every name represents a \"vocal imitation\" of the subject that it describes, for instance arguing that \"s\" appears in the words \"snake\" and \"serpent\" because it resembles the curved movement of the animal.\nFollowing the controversy that erupted around Salman Rushdie's 1988 book \"The Satanic Verses\", Michell published a tract condemning Rushdie, accusing him of deliberately and provocatively insulting Islam. Titled \"Rushdie's Insult\", Michell later withdrew the publication.\n\nMichell was keenly interested in the crop circle phenomenon, and with Christine Rhone and Richard Adams he established a magazine devoted to the subject in 1990. Initially titled \"The Cereologist\", some issues would be alternately titled \"The Cerealogist\", and although Michell initially served as the magazine's editor, he stepped down after the ninth issue, although continued to contribute articles to it. In 1991, he published a book on the subject, \"Dowsing the Crop Circles\", and in 2001 followed this with a booklet titled \"The Face and the Message\", which was devoted to a circle depicting the face of a Grey alien which had appeared in Hampshire in August 2001. Despite the longstanding animosity with which Michell held academic archaeology, in 1991 the peer-reviewed archaeological journal \"Antiquity\" invited him to author a review of a Southbank exhibit, \"From Art to Archaeology\", which was duly published in the journal.\n\nIn the 1980s Michell was a member of the Lindisfarne Association and a teacher at its School of Sacred Architecture. He lectured at the Kairos Foundation, an \"educational charity specifically founded to promote the recovery of traditional values in the Arts and Sciences\". He was for some years a visiting lecturer at the Prince of Wales' School of Traditional Arts, which had been established by his friend Keith Critchlow. He became a Fellow of the Temenos Academy, a religious organisation which had Traditionalist underpinnings.\n\nFrom January 1992 until his death, Michell published a monthly column, \"An Orthodox Voice\", in \"The Oldie\" magazine. He primarily used this as an outlet for condemning the modern world and lambasting what he perceived as the stupidity of most contemporary humans. His first article in this outlet contained an attack on evolution which resulted in a published response from the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. He also used his column to encourage the use of mind-altering drugs, in particular LSD. Two anthologies that collected together some of these \"Oldie\" columns would be published; the first appeared in 1995 as \"An Orthodox Voice\" while the second was published in 2005 as \"Confessions of a Radical Traditionalist\" and contained an introduction from the scholar of esotericism Joscelyn Godwin. During this period, Michell also authored occasional book review for the conservative magazine, \"The Spectator\".\n\nIn 1996 Michell published \"Who Wrote Shakespeare?\", in which he outlined various candidates in the Shakespeare authorship question. \"Who Wrote Shakespeare?\" received mixed reviews: \"Publishers Weekly\" was critical, while \"The Washington Post\" and \"The Independent\" praised his treatment of the subject. To mark their fiftieth anniversary in 1999, the publisher Thames and Hudson – who had published many of Michell's works – suggested that a biography be written by Michell's friend Paul Screeton. Michell however refused to cooperate with the project, which was abandoned. In 2000, Michell published \"The Temple at Jerusalem: A Revelation\", in which he outlined his own interpretation of Jerusalem's Old City.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004 he contributed several columns to tabloid newspaper \"The Mirror\" as part of an ongoing series run by the astrologer Jonathan Cainer. Cainer had sought to bring together a range of esotericists to write on related topics, with Michell's fellow contributors including Mark Winter, Patty Greenall, Sarah Sirillan, and Uri Geller. The series came to an end when Cainer left \"The Mirror\" to work for the rival \"Daily Mail\".\n\nA keen painter, in 2003 an exhibit of his works was held at the Christopher Gibbs Gallery. In April 2007 Michell married Denise Price, the Archdruidess of the Glastonbury Order of Druids, at a ceremony held in Glastonbury's St Benedict's Church, although their relationship ended several months later. A lifelong smoker, Michell contracted lung cancer, and in his final days he was nursed at his son's home in Poole, Dorset, ultimately dying on 24 April 2009, at the age of 76. His body was buried at St Mary's Church in Stoke Abbott on May Day. A high church memorial service was then held at All Saints' Church in Notting Hill, which was attended by around 400 mourners. \nHis work, \"How the World is Made\" – which he regarded as his \"magnum opus\" – was published posthumously.\n\nThroughout his life, Michell's \"views remained relatively static\", albeit with some exceptions. He characterised his viewpoint as \"Radical Traditionalism\", which in his words was a perspective \"both idealistic and rooted in common sense\".\nMichell was a proponent of the Traditionalist school of esoteric thought. Michell was also interested in the writings of Traditionalist philosopher Julius Evola, agreeing in particular with the sentiments expressed in Evola's \"Revolt Against the Modern World\". He held to the Traditionalist belief in an ancient perennial tradition found across the world, believing that this was passed on by a priesthood in accordance to divine will. He shared the Traditionalist attitude of anti-modernism, believing that modernity had brought about chaos, destruction of the land, and spiritual degradation. He believed that humanity would return to what he perceived as its natural order and enter a Golden Age.\n\nScreeton believed that despite his \"obvious acts of liberalism\", Michell also had a \"right-wing streak\", with Hale describing Mitchell as being \"quite right-wing in many of his views\". She thought it would be \"apt\" to characterise Mitchell's thought as being \"third positionist\" in nature.\n\nAngered by the idea of evolution, Michell repeatedly authored articles denouncing it as a false creation myth. Instead he embraced a viewpoint that Screeton referred to as \"intelligent design creationism\". Accordingly, he was particularly critical of Charles Darwin and Dawkins, lambasting the latter alongside physicist Stephen Hawking as belonging with \"the disappointed Marxists, pandering politicians, pettifoggers, grievance-mongers and atheistic bishops who set the tone in modern society.\" Condemning the scientific community's view of the development of the Earth and humanity, he embraced Richard Milton's claim that the Earth was only 20,000 years old, as well as Rupert Sheldrake's idea regarding \"morphogenetic fields\", believing that it was these – and not biological evolution – that resulted in changes occurring within species.\n\nMitchell's conception of the physical and spiritual worlds was strongly influenced by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. He believed that sacred geometry revealed a universal scheme in the landscape which reflected the structure of the heavens. His views on geometry led him to the belief that pre-industrial societies across the world respected the Earth as a living creature imbued with its own spirit, and that humans then created permanent residences for this spirit.\nHe also embraced a belief in the tenets of astrology, alchemy, and prophecy, believing that all had been unfairly rejected by the modern world.\n\nDescribed as an exponent of \"British nativist spirituality\", he adopted the view of the British-Israelite movement that the British people represented the descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes who are mentioned in the Old Testament. Michell sometimes referred to his approach as \"mystic nationalism\" and interpreted the island of Britain as being sacred, connecting this attitude to those of William Blake and Lewis Spence. Adopting a millennialist attitude, he believed that in future Britain would be reborn as the New Jerusalem with the coming of a new Golden Age.\n\nHe believed that humans really desired to live in a state of extreme order, deeming a societal hierarchy to be natural and inevitable. Generally opposed to democracy, except within small groups in which every person knew the individual being elected, Michell instead believed that communities should be led by a strong leader who personified the solar deity. This embrace of the Divine Right of Kings led him to believe that Queen Elizabeth II should take control of Britain as an authoritarian leader who could intercede between the British people and the divine. He was critical of multiculturalism in Britain, believing that each ethnic or cultural group should live independently in an area segregated from other groups, stating that this would allow a people's traditions to remain vibrant. He did not espouse racial supremacy, with his ideas on this subject instead being similar to the ethnopluralism of Alain de Benoist and other New Right thinkers. He was an opponent of British membership of the European Union and also opposed the UK's transition to the metric system, instead favouring the continued use of imperial measurement, believing that the latter had links to the divine order used by ancient society.\n\nAt over six feet in height, Michell was described by biographer and friend Paul Screeton as having \"a charismatic personality and imposing presence\", being \"placidly outgoing and the epitome of gentlemanly charm\", and usually appeared \"cheerful and optimistic\".\nIn keeping with his upper-class background, he was described as having an \"unmistakable patrician hauteur\", with \"all the self-assurance, impeccable manners and debonair charm of one born to wealth.\" Screeton described Michell as \"gregarious but slightly shy, unassuming but opinionated. Quixotic in behaviour, he was an exemplary host and fastidious and single-minded when embarked upon a project\", although also noted that Michell was impatient with those who did not share his Traditionalist beliefs and values.\n\nIn keeping with norms within the counter-culture, Michell regularly smoked marijuana, and publicly encouraged the use of mind-altering drugs. His favoured newspaper was \"The Telegraph\", a right-wing daily. One of his hobbies was woodworking, and he constructed some of the bookshelves in his home. Although he had a strong dislike of computers and advised his readers not to possess a personal computer, in later life he obtained one in order to type up his writings using a word processor. For many years, he lived at 11 Powis Gardens in Notting Hill, North London.\n\nScreeton described Michell as \"a countercultural icon\", while Hale stated that on his death, Michell left \"a rich legacy of publications and cultural influence\". At the time he was remembered as \"a charming British eccentric and champion of the outsider\". His influence was strongly apparent in the British Pagan community, with many British Pagans being familiar with his writings. The archaeologist Adam Stout noted that Michell played \"the major role in the 1960s rediscovery\" of the work of Alfred Watkins.\nHutton for instance noted that the influence of Michell's ideas could be seen on the Druidic Order of the Pendragon, a Pagan group based in Leicestershire that arose to public attention in 2004. His ideas about dragon energies across the landscape have been incorporated into novels like Judy Allen's 1973 \"The Spring of the Mountain\" and Cara Louise's 2006 \"Annie and the Dragon\".\n\nMichell's books received a broadly positive reception amongst the \"New Age\" and \"Earth mysteries\" movements and he is credited as perhaps being \"the most articulate and influential writer on the subject of leys and alternative studies of the past\". Ronald Hutton describes his research as part of an alternative archaeology \"quite unacceptable to orthodox scholarship.\" Accordingly, Screeton noted that during his life, Michell was considered to be \"anathema, lunatic fringe, and cranky\" by his critics, although he rejected the idea that Michell was a \"crank\", claiming that such an accusation was \"fundamentally mistaken\".\n\nFollowing his death, various aspects of Michell's work have been adopted by thinkers associated with the European New Right and with related right-wing currents in the United States.\nMichell's term \"Radical Traditionalism\", which he espoused in his self-published series of \"Radical Traditionalist Papers\" in the 1970s and 1980s, would later be taken up as a self-descriptor by Michael Moynihan and Joshua Buckley, the editors of the right-wing journal \"Tyr: Myth, Culture and Tradition\" from their inaugural 2002 edition onward. The editors of \"Tyr\" gave the term political overtones which were not present in Michell's original usage of the term. Hale believed that through Radical Traditionalism and the New Right Mitchell's writings have been brought to \"a whole new audience\" where they have a \"surprisingly different sort of relevance.\"\n\n\nD Fideler, \"Jesus Christ, Sun of God\", Page 291, Appendix 1, The Miraculous Catch of 153 Fishes in the Unbroken Net\n\n"}

A professor at the University of Bergen from 1973 to 2000, he specialized in the late medieval history of Norway. He has contributed to several large works.\n\nHe was born in Larvik as the son of school inspector Hermann Olai Helle (1893–1973) and teacher Berta Marie Malm (1906–1991). He was the older brother of politician Ingvar Lars Helle. The family moved to Hetland when Knut Helle was seventeen years old.\n\nHe took the examen artium in Stavanger in 1949, and a teacher's education in Kristiansand in 1952. He studied philology in Oslo and Bergen, and graduated with the cand.philol. degree in 1957. His paper \"Omkring Bǫglungasǫgur\", on the Bagler sagas, was printed in 1959. In December 1957 he married Karen Blauuw, who would later become a professor. Helle's marriage to Blauuw was dissolved in 1985. In October 1987 Helle got married to museum director and professor of medieval archaeology Ingvild Øye. They reside in Bergen.\n\nHelle was a research fellow at the University of Bergen from 1958 to 1963, with the last year being spent at Oxford University. He was hired as a lecturer of history at the University of Bergen in 1963, and promoted to professor in 1973. He specialized in the history of Norway in the Late Middle Ages, and his first major work was \"Norge blir en stat 1130–1319\", published in 1964 and covering general Norwegian history from 1130 from 1319. His main work was \"Konge og gode menn i norsk riksstyring ca. 1150–1319\", published in 1972. In historiography, he is known for reaching different conclusions than did important Norwegian historians of the 1930s, such as Edvard Bull, Sr. and Andreas Holmsen.\n\nHelle also made his mark by contributing to larger historical works. In 1982 he published \"Kongssete og kjøpstad. Fra opphavet til 1536\", volume one of \"Bergen bys historie\", the history of Bergen. He was involved in the editorial work of both \"Aschehougs verdenshistorie\" and \"Aschehougs norgeshistorie\", general works on global and Norwegian history from the publishing house Aschehoug. In the former series he published volume five—\"Nomadefolk og høykultur 1000-1300\"— in 1984, and in the latter series he published volume three—\"Under kirke og kongemakt 1130–1350\"— in 1995. He also was a member of the editorial committee of \"Oslo bys historie\" and \"Norsk utviklingshjelps historie\", and led the editorial committee of the \"Norsk biografisk leksikon\", which was published in ten volumes between 1999 and 2005. In 2006 Helle published \"Norsk byhistorie: urbanisering gjennom 1300 år\" together with Finn-Einar Eliassen, Jan Eivind Myhre and Ola Svein Stugu.\n\nHelle was the vice dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Bergen from 1978 to 1980, and chair of the Chr.

{"id": "28813036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28813036", "title": "Maní (Amazonian legend)", "text": "Maní (Amazonian legend)\n\nManí, a Tupí myth of origins, is the name of an indigenous girl with very fair complexion. The Amazonian legend of Maní is related to the cult of Manioc, the native staple food that sprang from her grave.\n\nThe daughter of a Tupí chief became pregnant. Her father wanted to take revenge on the man who brought shame to his family and dishonour to his pride despite her saying that she had known no man. He insisted that she revealed the name of the man and even made use of prayers, threats and finally severe punishments. As she refused to say, her father held her prisoner inside a hut and decided to kill her. So with this thought in mind the chief of the tribe went to sleep and dreamed of a white-skinned man dressed like a warrior who told him that his daughter was telling him the truth and that she had not had any contact with any man. He told him to take care of his daughter because one day she was going to bear a great gift for all his tribe.\n\nAfter nine full moons she gave birth to a girl whose skin was as white as the moon and her eyes as dark as the night. That caused the surprise of not only the entire tribe, but also of the neighboring tribes who came to visit the new born child for they could not believe she was white. Happy and beautiful Maní grew up until after her first birthday, when she died unexpectedly without signs of any illness or pain. The chief was so desolate that he buried the child inside his own hut. Her mother watered her grave every single day, as it was then the custom in her tribe. One day a different kind of plant sprang up from Maní's grave, and as no one had ever seen that kind of plant, they let it grow and no one in the tribe dared touch it. They even noticed that when the birds ate the fruits of the plant, they displayed strange symptoms, as if they were drunk. Sometime later a crack opened on the earth and the people of the tribe found a fruit that resembled the white skin tone of the dead child's body. They picked up the fruit from the ground, peeled and cooked it, and for their surprise it tasted delicious. It even renewed their strength. They also raspped it and prepared a drink which could easily put one to sleep. So, from this day on, they began using the root as their staple food and called it \"mandioca\", which in Tupy language means \"house (oca, in Tupi–Guarani) of Mandi= Maní\".\n\nAlternative versions for the legend exist. One says that a good spirit came down to Earth and showed the manioc to the Indians, teaching them to extract the evil spirit dwelling in it, despite failing to teach them how the plant might be reproduced. After that, one of the female Indians of the tribe, while wandering through the forest, encountered a beautiful young hunter who was no other than the manioc metamorphosed. He seduced her and a daughter was born from this union. She led the tribe to the plantation of the shrub and taught them how to reproduce it from the fine portions of the stem.\n\nA more elaborate version by Couto de Magalhaes tells how the chief of the tribe was about to kill his daughter when a white male warrior appeared in his dream and told him not to do so because his daughter was telling him the truth, and that she really had no contact with any man. The child born to the maiden was a boy who was named Maní. At the end of a year, the child perished unexpectedly without showing signs of illness. He was buried and later a strange plant grew upon his grave. The Indians opened the grave and instead of finding the body of the child, discovered a root which they called Mani-oka (House of Mani).\n\nAnother version given by Carlos Teschauer says that the child born from the union of the chief's daughter and the white warrior not only lived long, but also taught his tribe many things. He also told them that after a year from his death they should open his grave that the greatest treasure of all, a bread-yielding root, would be then revealed to them.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "297351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297351", "title": "Mao suit", "text": "Mao suit\n\nThe Yat-Sen Suit, also called the Mao suit, Chinese tunic suit or Zhongshan suit, is a style of Chinese menswear associated in China with Sun Yat-sen (better known to mainland Chinese as \"Sun Zhongshan\"), although it is more commonly associated in the West with Mao Zedong. \n\nSun Yat-sen introduced the style shortly after the founding of the Republic of China as a form of national dress with distinct political symbolism. Following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Mao and other leaders continued to wear the garment as a symbol of proletarian unity and as an Eastern counterpart to the business suit. It became less popular after the Opening Up of China under Deng Xiaoping but is still commonly worn by Chinese leaders during important state ceremonies and functions.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s the Mao suit became fashionable among Western European, Australian, and New Zealander socialists and intellectuals. It was sometimes worn over a turtleneck.\n\nWhen the Republic was founded in 1912, the style of dress worn in China was based on Manchu dress (\"qipao\" and \"changshan\"), which had been imposed by the Qing Dynasty as a form of social control. The majority-Han Chinese revolutionaries who overthrew the Qing were fueled by failure of the Qing to defend China and a lack of scientific advancement compared to the West. Even before the founding of the Republic, older forms of Chinese dress were becoming unpopular among the elite and led to the development of Chinese dress which combined the changshan and the Western hat to form a new dress. The Zhongshan suit is a similar development which combined Western and Eastern fashions. \n\nThe Zhongshan suit was an attempt to cater to contemporary sensibilities without adopting Western styles wholesale. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was personally involved, providing inputs based on his life experience in Japan: the Japanese cadet uniform became a basis of the Zhongshan suit. There were other modifications as well: instead of the three hidden pockets in Western suits, the Zhongshan suit had four outside pockets to adhere to Chinese concepts of balance and symmetry; an inside pocket was also available. Over time, minor stylistic changes developed. The suit originally had seven buttons, later reduced to five.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to win support and recognition from Western countries failed, the Nationalist Party government in Canton led by Sun gained help (advisers and small arms) from Soviet Russia, which viewed it as a likely revolutionary ally against Western interests in the Far East; Chinese nationalism at the time (of treaty ports and extraterritoriality discriminations) was heavily infected with resentment against the West. As a result of this geopolitical alignment, Sun agreed to permit the nascent Chinese Communist Party to join the Nationalist Party — as individual members — not as a party-party union, combination or alliance. As a result, early Communist Party members adopted the attire as a mark of joining the Nationalist Party. From that practice during an attenuated political marriage of convenience which would soon be divorced in blood (in 1927), Asian Marxist movements and governments henceforth would all consider this attire as a standard of political coloration, and it would continue to be appropriate dress for both sides of the bitter Chinese civil wars lasting decades.\n\nAfter Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925, popular mythology assigned a revolutionary and patriotic significance to the Zhongshan suit. The four pockets were said to represent the Four Virtues cited in the classic \"Guanzi\": Propriety, Justice, Honesty, and Shame. The five center-front buttons were said to represent the five Yuans (branches of government)–legislation, supervision, examination, administration and jurisdiction–cited in the constitution of the Republic of China and the three cuff-buttons to symbolize Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People: Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood. Finally, unlike Western-style suits that are usually composed of two layers of cloth, the jacket is in a single piece—symbolizing China's unity and peace.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, civil servants of the Chinese government were required to wear the \"Zhongshan zhuang\". A slightly modified version of the suit, adapted for combat, formed the basis for National Revolutionary Army uniforms leading up through the Second Sino-Japanese War, although during the 1930s, as German military advice and assistance to the National Government increased, the formal military uniform in the professional elements and ranks essentially became that of Weimar and then Nazi Germany (including the famous helmet). \n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and especially during the long Maoist era culminating with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the suit came to be widely worn by the entire male population as a symbol of proletarian unity; it was regularly worn by Communist Party cadres until the 1990s when it was largely replaced by the Western business suit. \n\nThe Mao suit remained the standard formal dress for the first and second generations of PRC leaders such as Deng Xiaoping. During the 1990s, it began to be worn with decreasing frequency by leaders of Jiang Zemin's generation as more and more Chinese politicians began wearing traditional Western-style suits with neckties. Jiang wore it only on special occasions, such as to state dinners. Hu Jintao still wore the Mao suit, but only on special occasions, such as the ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic in 2009. Hu Jintao even showed up to a black tie state dinner in the United States wearing a business suit, attracting some criticism for being underdressed at a formal occasion. In the Xi Jinping administration, however, the Mao suit made a comeback as a diplomatic uniform and evening dress.\n\nIn Taiwan, the Zhongshan suit was seldom seen after the 1970s. Moreover, given the subtropical weather much of the year in Taiwan, a modified version which dropped the buttoned-up collar original constriction in favor of a Western-style open dress shirt collar became standard for a time.\n\nThe Mao suit is worn at the most formal ceremonies as a symbol of national sovereignty. Chinese paramount leaders always wear Mao suits for military parades in Beijing, even though the Vice President and other Politburo officials wear Western business suits. It is customary for Chinese leaders to wear Mao suits when attending state dinners. In this situation, the Mao suit serves as a form of evening dress, equivalent to a military uniform for a monarch, or a tuxedo for a president.\n\nThe Mao suit also serves as a diplomatic uniform. Although Chinese ambassadors usually wear Western business suits, many Chinese ambassadors choose to wear a Mao suit when they present their credentials to the head of state. The presentation ceremony is symbolic of the diplomatic recognition that exists between the two countries, so it carries a higher level of formality than other diplomatic meetings.\n\n"}

{"id": "19398801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19398801", "title": "Modello", "text": "Modello\n\nA modello (plural modelli), from Italian, is a preparatory study or model, usually at a smaller scale, for a work of art or architecture, especially one produced for the approval of the commissioning patron. The term gained currency in art circles in Tuscany in the fourteenth century. Modern definitions in reference works vary somewhat. Alternative and overlapping terms are \"oil sketch\" (\"schizzo\") and \"cartoon\" for paintings or stained glass, maquette, plastico or bozzetto for sculpture or architecture, or architectural model.\n\nThough in Gothic figural arts bishops and abbots are often represented carrying small simulacra of buildings they had constructed—\"models\" in the familiar modern sense—\"modello\" is only used of pieces which pre-date the finished work, and were at least in part produced by the main artist involved. The less frequently found term ricordo (Italian for \"record\" or \"memory\") means a similar piece produced as a small copy \"after\" completion of the work as a record for the workshop. Naturally it is not always easy for art historians to decide whether a particular piece is one or the other, and, especially in the Late Renaissance and Baroque periods, when several versions of a painting were made, the \"ricordo\" for the prime version might serve in the atelier as the \"modello\" for the subsequent ones. No doubt a modello was often modified after the main work was completed to reflect any changes in the composition during painting, thus making it a ricordo also; this would normally be impossible for art historians to distinguish from a modello altered during its original production. \n\nThe Tiepolo at right was catalogued as a modello by Michael Levey, but recent x-ray investigation of the huge finished work in Munich has revealed that in its underpainting it was closer to another, very different and less finished modello, now in the Courtauld Institute, and it has been asserted that the National Gallery picture illustrated is a ricordo. The National Gallery still describe it as \"probably a modello\", presumably produced after work had already begun.\n\n\"Cartoon\", named for the sturdy \"cartone\" paper on which they were generally executed, is usually used of working drawings, often at full scale, but the distinction is not a firm one, and the terms \"cartoon\" and \"working drawing\" are often used interchangeably. \"Modello\" is especially used of older Italian art and architecture from the late Middle Ages onwards; initially these were mostly drawings, perhaps with some colour from chalk or watercolour, or with colours indicated in writing. The diminutive term modeletto will always be used of small-scale versions. As an Italian word, \"modello\" may be printed in italics, or not. The French version of the word, \"modèle\", may be used of French works, and is normally italicised.\n\nEspecially in the case of oil sketches, many \"modelli\" are greatly valued in their own right, as they may show a freedom in execution and freshness of inspiration missing in the final work, and also may show changes in composition from the finished work, throwing light on the process of artistic creation. Earlier stages of the creative process may be recorded in \"preparatory drawings\" or \"studies\", either for the whole composition, or a part of it, such as a single figure.\nAn example of a modello of a fresco cycle, which was rescued for its intrinsic value is in Giorgio Vasari's \"vita\" of Rosso Fiorentino: Vasari reports that a modello for Rosso's frescoes in Santa Maria delle Lagrime, Arezzo, was carried out by Rosso for Giovanni Pollastra, the inventor of the complex program there, \"un bellisimo modello di tutto l'opera, che è oggi nelle nostre case di Arezzo.\" A preliminary \"modello colorito\" in the form of a painted three-dimensional model was especially important to prejudge the finished effect of illusionistic \"sotto-in-su\" perspectives on the curved surfaces of vaulted ceilings, as Andrea Pozzo, the perfector of the illusionistic ceiling, noted in his \"Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum\" (1700–17) \n\nMany modelli show versions of works which were never actually realised, or have been lost. Famous examples are the alternative designs produced for the competition in 1401 to design the North doors of the Florence Baptistry. Lorenzo Ghiberti won, beating six other artists, including Filippo Brunelleschi, Donatello and Jacopo della Quercia; the modelli survive, for a single panel, of the first two named (Bargello – picture above).\n\nThere are alternative, unrealised, modelli for many famous buildings, including St Peter's, Rome and the \"Great Model\" of St Paul's Cathedral, London, showing a different design by Sir Christopher Wren from that actually built. When accepted, such models were retained during the work, as concrete expressions of what was expected under the terms of the contract, and afterwards were preserved in storage through salutary neglect.\n\n"}
{"id": "4894070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4894070", "title": "Nazi UFOs", "text": "Nazi UFOs\n\nIn Ufology, conspiracy theory, science fiction, and comic book stories, claims or stories have circulated linking UFOs to Nazi Germany. The German UFO theories describe supposedly successful attempts to develop advanced aircraft or spacecraft prior to and during World War II, and further assert the post-war survival of these craft in secret underground bases in Antarctica, South America, or the United States, along with their creators. According to these theories and fictional stories, various potential code-names or sub-classifications of Nazi UFO craft such as \"Rundflugzeug\", \"Feuerball\", \"Diskus\", \"Haunebu\", \"Hauneburg-Gerät\", \"V7\", \"Vril\", \"Kugelblitz\" (not related to the self-propelled anti-aircraft gun of the same name), \"Andromeda-Gerät\", \"Flugkreisel\", \"Kugelwaffe\", and \"Reichsflugscheibe\" have all been referenced.\n\nAccounts appear as early as 1950, likely inspired by historical German development of specialized engines such as Viktor Schauberger's \"Repulsine\" around the time of World War II. Elements of these claims have been widely incorporated into various works of fictional and purportedly non-fictional media, including video games and documentaries, often mixed with more substantiated information.\n\nGerman UFO literature very often conforms largely to documented history on the following points:\n\n\nIn World War II, the so-called \"foo fighters\", a variety of unusual and anomalous aerial phenomena, were witnessed by both Axis and Allied personnel. While some foo fighter reports were dismissed as the misperceptions of troops in the heat of combat, others were taken seriously, and leading scientists such as Luis Alvarez began to investigate them. In at least some cases, Allied intelligence and commanders suspected that foo fighters reported in the European theater represented advanced German aircraft or weapons, particularly given that Germans had already developed such technological innovations as V-1 and V-2 rockets and the first operational jet-powered Me 262 fighter planes, and that a minority of foo fighters seemed to have inflicted damage to allied aircraft.\n\nSimilar sentiments regarding German technology resurfaced in 1947 with the first wave of flying saucer reports after Kenneth Arnold's widely reported close encounter with nine crescent-shaped objects moving at a high velocity. Personnel of Project Sign, the first U.S. Air Force UFO investigation group, noted that the advanced flying wing aeronautical designs of the German Horten brothers were similar to some UFO reports. In 1959, Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of Project Blue Book (Project Sign's follow-up investigation) wrote:\nWhile these early speculations and reports were limited primarily to military personnel, the earliest assertion of German flying saucers in the mass media appears to have been an article which appeared in the Italian newspaper \"Il Giornale d'Italia\" in early 1950. Written by Professor Giuseppe Belluzzo, an Italian scientist and a former Italian Minister of National Economy under the Mussolini regime, it claimed that \"types of flying discs were designed and studied in Germany and Italy as early as 1942\". Belluzzo also expressed the opinion that \"some great power is launching discs to study them\".\n\nThe Bell UFO was among the first flying objects to be connected with the Nazis. It apparently had occult markings on it and it was also rumoured to have been very similar to a Wehrmacht document about a vertical take off aircraft. It is directly related to the supposed crash of a bell-shaped object that occurred in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, USA on December 9, 1965. The same month, German engineer Rudolf Schriever gave an interview to German news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" in which he claimed that he had designed a craft powered by a circular plane of rotating turbine blades in diameter. He said that the project had been developed by him and his team at BMW's Prague works until April 1945, when he fled Czechoslovakia. His designs for the disk and a model were stolen from his workshop in Bremerhaven-Lehe in 1948 and he was convinced that Czech agents had built his craft for \"a foreign power\". In a separate interview with \"Der Spiegel\" in October 1952 he said that the plans were stolen from a farm he was hiding in near Regen on 14 May 1945. There are other discrepancies between the two interviews that add to the confusion. However, many skeptics have doubted that such a Bell UFO was actually designed or ever built.\n\nIn 1953, when Avro Canada announced that it was developing the VZ-9-AV Avrocar, a circular jet aircraft with an estimated speed of , German engineer Georg Klein claimed that such designs had been developed during the Nazi era. Klein identified two types of supposed German flying disks:\n\n\nAeronautical engineer Roy Fedden remarked that the only craft that could approach the capabilities attributed to flying saucers were those being designed by the Germans towards the end of the war. Fedden (who was also chief of the technical mission to Germany for the Ministry of Aircraft Production) stated in 1945: \n\nFedden also added that the Germans were working on a number of very unusual aeronautical projects, though he did not elaborate upon his statement.\n\n\"Le Matin des Magiciens\" (\"The Morning of the Magicians\"), a 1960 book by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, made many spectacular claims about the Vril Society of Berlin. Several years later writers, including Jan van Helsing, Norbert-Jürgen Ratthofer, and Vladimir Terziski, have built on their work, connecting the Vril Society with UFOs. Among their claims, they imply that the society may have made contact with an alien race and dedicated itself to creating spacecraft to reach the aliens. In partnership with the Thule Society and the Nazi Party, the Vril Society developed a series of flying disc prototypes. With the Nazi defeat, the society allegedly retreated to a base in Antarctica and vanished into the hollow Earth to meet up with the leaders of an advanced race inhabiting inner Earth.\n\nWhen German Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel started Samisdat Publishers in the 1970s, he initially catered to the UFOlogy community, which was then at its peak of public acceptance. His books claimed that flying saucers were Nazi secret weapons launched from an underground base in Antarctica, from which the Nazis hoped to conquer the Earth and possibly the planets. Zündel also sold (for $9999) seats on an exploration team to locate the polar entrance to the hollow earth. Some who interviewed Zündel claim that he privately admitted it was a deliberate hoax to build publicity for Samisdat, although he still defended it as late as 2002.\n\nIn 1978, Miguel Serrano, a Chilean diplomat and Nazi sympathizer, published , in which he claimed that Adolf Hitler was an Avatar of Vishnu and was, at that time, communing with Hyperborean gods in an underground Antarctic base in New Swabia. Serrano predicted that Hitler would lead a fleet of UFOs from the base to establish the Fourth Reich. In popular culture, this alleged UFO fleet is referred to as the \"Nazi flying saucers from Antarctica\".\n\nAccording to a 1979 interview conducted by FBI agent Robert Ressler, imprisoned serial killer Richard Chase believed or claimed to believe due to his schizophrenia that Nazi UFOs had extorted him into committing his murders under threat to his own life. Chase further claimed that prison officials in league with the Nazis were poisoning his food, and he asked Ressler to provide him with a radar gun, with which he could apprehend his enemies. On December 26, 1980, Chase was found dead in his cell. An autopsy found that he committed suicide with an overdose of prescribed antidepressants that he had saved over several weeks.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20785947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20785947", "title": "Objectivity (philosophy)", "text": "Objectivity (philosophy)\n\nObjectivity is a philosophical concept of being true independently from individual subjectivity caused by perception, emotions, or imagination. A proposition is considered to have objective truth when its truth conditions are met without bias caused by a sentient subject. Scientific objectivity refers to the ability to judge without partiality or external influence, sometimes used synonymously with \"neutrality\".\n\nPlato considered geometry a condition of idealism concerned with universal truth. His contrasting between objectivity and opinion became the basis for philosophies intent on resolving the questions of reality, truth, and existence. He saw opinions as belonging to the shifting sphere of sensibilities, as opposed to a fixed, eternal and knowable incorporeality. Where Plato distinguished between how we know things and their ontological status, subjectivism such as George Berkeley's depends on perception. In Platonic terms, a criticism of subjectivism is that it is difficult to distinguish between knowledge, opinions, and subjective knowledge.\n\nPlatonic idealism is a form of metaphysical objectivism, holding that the ideas exist independently from the individual. Berkeley's empirical idealism, on the other hand, holds that things only exist as they are perceived. Both approaches boast an attempt at objectivity. Plato's definition of objectivity can be found in his epistemology, which is based on mathematics, and his metaphysics, where knowledge of the ontological status of objects and ideas is resistant to change.\n\nIn opposition to philosopher René Descartes' method of personal deduction, natural philosopher Isaac Newton applied the relatively objective scientific method to look for evidence before forming a hypothesis. Partially in response to Kant's rationalism, logician Gottlob Frege applied objectivity to his epistemological and metaphysical philosophies. If reality exists independently of consciousness, then it would logically include a plurality of indescribable forms. Objectivity requires a definition of truth formed by propositions with truth value. An attempt of forming an objective construct incorporates ontological commitments to the reality of objects.\n\nThe importance of perception in evaluating and understanding objective reality is debated in the observer effect of quantum mechanics. Direct or naïve realists rely on perception as key in observing objective reality, while instrumentalists hold that observations are useful in predicting objective reality. The concepts that encompass these ideas are important in the philosophy of science. Philosophies of mind explore whether objectivity relies on perceptual constancy.\n\nThe term, \"ethical subjectivism\", covers two distinct theories in ethics. According to cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, the truth of moral statements depends upon people's values, attitudes, feelings, or beliefs. Some forms of cognitivist ethical subjectivism can be counted as forms of realism, others are forms of anti-realism. David Hume is a foundational figure for cognitive ethical subjectivism. On a standard interpretation of his theory, a trait of character counts as a moral virtue when it evokes a sentiment of approbation in a sympathetic, informed, and rational human observer. Similarly, Roderick Firth's ideal observer theory held that right acts are those that an impartial, rational observer would approve of. William James, another ethical subjectivist, held that an end is good (to or for a person) just in the case it is desired by that person (see also ethical egoism). According to non-cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands. For example, on A. J. Ayer's emotivism, the statement, \"Murder is wrong\" is equivalent in meaning to the emotive, \"Murder, Boo!\"\n\nAccording to the ethical objectivist, the truth or falsehood of typical moral judgments does not depend upon the beliefs or feelings of any person or group of persons. This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about chemistry, biology, or history, in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false—no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels.\n\nThere are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, Kantianism, utilitarianism, and certain forms of ethical egoism and contractualism. Note that Platonists define ethical objectivism in an even more narrow way, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference—and, as such, considers any arbitrary frame of reference ultimately a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality and can be used for measurements.\n\n\n\n"}

The FNLA occupied northern Angola and UNITA the central south, while the MPLA mostly occupied the coastline, the far south-east and, after capturing it in November 1974, Cabinda. Negotiations for independence resulted in the Treaty of Alvor being signed on 15 January 1975, naming the date of official independence as 11 November 1975. The agreement ended the war for independence but marked the escalation of the civil war. Two dissenting groups, the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda and the Eastern Revolt, never signed the accords, as they were excluded from negotiations. The coalition government established by the Treaty of Alvor soon ended as nationalist factions, doubting one another's intentions, tried to control the country by force.\n\nFighting between the three forces resumed in Luanda hardly a day after the transitional government assumed office on 15 January 1975.\n\nThe liberation forces sought to seize strategic points, most importantly the capital, by the official day of independence. The MPLA managed to seize Luanda from the FLNA whilst UNITA retreated from the capital. By March 1975, the FNLA was driving towards Luanda from the north, joined by units of the Zairian army which the United States had encouraged Zaire to provide.\nBetween 28 April and early May, 1,200 Zairian troops crossed into northern Angola to assist the FNLA.\n\nThe FNLA eliminated all remaining MPLA presence in the northern provinces and assumed positions east of Kifangondo on the eastern outskirts of Luanda, from where it continued to encroach on the capital. The situation for the MPLA in Luanda became increasingly precarious.\n\nThe MPLA received supplies from the Soviet Union and repeatedly requested 100 officers for military training from Cuba. Until late August, Cuba had a few technical advisors deployed in Angola. By 9 July, the MPLA gained control of the capital, Luanda.\n\nStarting 21 August, Cuba established four training facilities (CIR) with almost 500 men, which were to train about 4,800 FAPLA recruits in three to six months. The mission was expected to be short-term and to last about 6 months.\nThe CIR in Cabinda accounted for 191 instructors, while Benguela, Saurimo (formerly Henrique de Carvalho) and at N'Dalatando (formerly Salazar) had 66 or 67 instructors each. Some were posted in headquarters in Luanda or in other places throughout the country. The training centres were operational by 18–20 October.\n\nSouth African Defence Force (SADF) involvement in Angola, part of the interrelated South African Border War, started in 1966 when the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO) commenced an armed struggle for Namibian independence. SWAPO officials founded an armed wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), which operated from bases in Zambia and rural Ovamboland.\n\nWith the loss of the Portuguese colonial administration as an ally and the possibility of new regimes sympathetic to SWAPO in Lisbon's former colonies, Pretoria recognised that it would lose a valued \"cordon sanitaire\" between South West Africa and the Frontline States. PLAN could seek sanctuary in Angola, and South Africa would be faced with another hostile regime and potentially militarised border to cross in pursuit of Namibian guerrillas.\n\nWith both the Soviet Union and the United States arming major factions in the Angolan Civil War, the conflict escalated into a major Cold War battleground. South Africa offered advisory and technical assistance to UNITA, while a number of Cuban combat troops entered the country to fight alongside the Marxist MPLA. Moscow also plied its Angolan clients with heavy weapons. American aid to UNITA and the FNLA was initially undertaken with Operation IA Feature, but this was terminated by the Clark Amendment in October 1976. Aid would not yet return until after the repeal of the Clark Amendment in 1985. China subsequently recalled its military advisers from Zaire, ending its tacit support for the FNLA.\n\nCuban instructors began training PLAN in Zambia in April 1975, and the movement had 3,000 new recruits by April. Guerrilla activity intensified, election boycotts were staged in Ovamboland, and the Ovambo Chief Minister assassinated. South Africa responded by calling up more reservists and placing existing security forces along the border on standby. Raids into Angola became commonplace after July 15.\n\nConsequently, with the covert assistance of the United States through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), it began assisting UNITA and the FNLA in a bid to ensure that a neutral or friendly government in Luanda prevailed. On 14 July 1975, South African Prime Minister Balthazar Vorster approved weapons worth US $14 million to be bought secretly for FNLA and UNITA. of which the first shipments from South Africa arrived in August 1975.\n\nOn 9 August 1975 a 30-man SADF patrol moved some into southern Angola and occupied the Ruacana-Calueque hydro-electric complex and other installations on the Cunene River.\nThe scheme was an important strategic asset for Ovamboland, which relied on it for its water supply. The facility had been completed earlier in the year with South African funding.\nSeveral hostile incidences with UNITA and SWAPO frightening foreign workers had provided a rationale for the occupation.\nThe defence of the facility in southern Angola also was South Africa's justification for the first permanent deployment of regular SADF units inside Angola.\nOn 22 August 1975 the SADF initiated operation \"Sausage II\", a major raid against SWAPO in southern Angola and on 4 September 1975, Vorster authorized the provision of limited military training, advice and logistical assistance. In turn FNLA and UNITA would help the South Africans fight SWAPO.\n\nMeanwhile, the MPLA had gained against UNITA in Southern Angola and by mid-October was in control of 12 of Angola's provinces and most cities. UNITA's territory had been shrinking to parts of central Angola, and it became apparent that UNITA did not have any chance of capturing Luanda by independence day, which neither the United States nor South Africa were willing to accept.\n\nThe SADF established a training camp near Silva Porto (Kuito) and prepared the defences of Nova Lisboa (Huambo). They assembled the mobile attack unit \"Foxbat\" to stop approaching FAPLA-units with which it clashed on 5 October, thus saving Nova Lisboa for UNITA.\n\nOn 14 October, the South Africans secretly initiated Operation Savannah when Task Force Zulu, the first of several South African columns, crossed from Namibia into Cuando Cubango. The operation provided for elimination of the MPLA from the southern border area, then from south western Angola, from the central region, and finally for the capture of Luanda (the political faction that held Luanda would be recognised by Portugal on independence day as the official government).\nAccording to John Stockwell, a former CIA officer, \"there was close liaison between the CIA and the South Africans\" and \"'high officials' in Pretoria claimed that their intervention in Angola had been based on an 'understanding' with the United States\". The intervention was also backed by Zaire and Zambia.\n\nWith the liberation forces busy fighting each other, the SADF advanced very quickly. Task Force Foxbat joined the invasion in mid-October. The territory the MPLA had just gained in the south was quickly lost to the South African advances. After South African advisors and antitank weapons helped to stop an MPLA advance on Nova Lisboa (Huambo) in early October, Zulu captured Roçadas (Xangongo) by 20, Sá da Bandeira (Lubango) by 24 and Moçâmedes by 28 October.\n\nWith the South Africans moving quickly toward Luanda, the Cubans had to terminate the CIR at Salazar only 3 days after it started operating and deployed most of the instructors and Angolan recruits in Luanda.\nOn 2–3 November, 51 Cubans from the CIR Benguela and South Africans had their first direct encounter near Catengue, where FAPLA unsuccessfully tried to stop the Zulu advance. This encounter led Zulu-Commander Breytenbach to conclude that his troops had faced the best organized FAPLA opposition to date.\n\nFor the duration of the campaign, Zulu had advanced 3,159 km in thirty-three days and had fought twenty-one battles / skirmishes in addition to sixteen hasty and fourteen deliberate attacks. the Task Force accounted for an estimated 210 MPLA dead, 96 wounded and 50 POWs while it had suffered 5 dead and 41 wounded.\n\nAfter the MPLA debacle at Catengue, the Cubans became very aware of the South African intervention. On 4 November Castro decided to begin an intervention on an unprecedented scale: \"Operation Carlota\". The same day, a first airplane with 100 heavy weapon specialists, which the MPLA had requested in September, left for Brazzaville, arriving in Luanda on 7 November. On November 9 the first 100 men of a contingent of a 652-strong battalion of elite Special Forces were flown in. The 100 specialists and 88 men of the special forces were dispatched immediately to the nearby front at Kifangondo. They assisted 850 FAPLA, 200 Katangans and one Soviet advisor.\n\nWith the help of the Cubans and the Soviet advisor, FAPLA decisively repelled an FNLA-Zairian assault in the Battle of Kifangondo on 8 November. The South African contingent, 52 men commanded by General Ben de Wet Roos, that had provided for the artillery on the northern front, had to be evacuated by ship on 28 November. MPLA-leader Agostinho Neto proclaimed independence and the formation of the People's Republic of Angola on 11 November and became its first President.\n\nOn 6 and 7 November 1975 Zulu captured the harbour cities of Benguela (terminal of the Benguela railroad) and Lobito. The towns and cities captured by the SADF were given to UNITA. In central Angola, at the same time, combat unit Foxbat had moved north toward Luanda. By then, the South Africans realised that Luanda could not be captured by independence day on 11 November and the South Africans considered ending the advance and retreating. But on 10 November 1975 Vorster relented to UNITA's urgent request to maintain the military pressure with the objective of capturing as much territory as possible before the impending meeting of the Organization of African Unity. Thus, Zulu and Foxbat continued north with two new battle groups formed further inland (X-Ray and Orange) and \"there was little reason to think the FAPLA would be able to stop this expanded force from capturing Luanda within a week.\"\nThrough November and December 1975, the SADF presence in Angola numbered 2,900 to 3,000 personnel.\n\nAfter Luanda was secured against the north and with reinforcements from Cuba arriving, Zulu faced stronger resistance advancing on Novo Redondo (Sumbe). First Cuban reinforcements arrived in Porto Amboim, only a few km north of Novo Redondo, quickly destroying three bridges crossing the Queve river, effectively stopping the South African advance along the coast on 13 November 1975.\nDespite concerted efforts to advance north to Novo Redondo, the SADF was unable to break through FAPLA defences. In a last successful advance a South African task force and UNITA troops captured Luso on the Benguela railway on 11 December which they held until 27 December.\n\nBy mid-December South Africa extended military service and brought in reserves. \"An indication of the seriousness of the situation ... is that one of the most extensive military call-ups in South African history is now taking place\". By late December, the Cubans had deployed 3,500 to 4,000 troops in Angola, of which 1,000 were securing Cabinda, and eventually the struggle began to favour of the MPLA. Apart from being \"bogged down\" on the southern front, the South African advance halted, \"as all attempts by Battle-Groups Orange and X-Ray to extend the war into the interior had been forced to turn back by destroyed bridges\". In addition, South Africa had to deal with two other major setbacks: the international press criticism of the operation and the associated change of US policies. Following the discovery of SADF troops in Angola, most African and Western backers declined to continue to back the South Africans due to the negative publicity of links with the Apartheid government. The South African leadership felt betrayed with a member of congress saying \"When the chips were down there was not a single state prepared to stand with South Africa. Where was America? Where were Zaire, Zambia ... and South Africa's other friends?\"\n\nOn 10 November 1975, the day before Angolan independence, the FNLA attempted against advice to capture Luanda from the MPLA. South African gunners and aircraft assisted the offensive which went horribly wrong for the attackers; they were routed by the FAPLA assisted by Cubans manning superior weaponry that had arrived recently in the country. The South African artillery, antiquated due to the UN embargo, was not any match for the longer-ranged Cuban BM-21 rocket launchers, and therefore could not influence the result of the battle.\n\nThe Cuban military, anticipating a South African advance (under the direction of Lieutenant Christopher du Raan) towards the town of Ebo, established positions there at a river crossing to thwart any assault. The defending artillery force, equipped with a BM-21 battery, a 76mm field gun, and several anti-tank units, subsequently destroyed five to six armoured cars, whilst they were bogged down with RPG-7s, on November 25, killing 5 and wounding 11 South African soldiers.\n\nSecond in command (2IC) car manned by Lt Jaco \"Bok\" Kriel, Cpl Gerrie Hugo and Richard \"Flappie\" Ludwig scouted to the North to look for an alternative route across the river. They got bogged down but managed to dig themselves out of the mud. Unbeknown to them this happened right in front of the enemy positions. Apparently only the superb fire control of the enemy saved them from a certain demise.\nJohann du Toit's troop moved forward towards the bridge after Hannes Swanepoel's troop deployed tactically and all, with the odd exception, got stuck in the mud.\n\nThe troop of Abrie Cloete also moved into the terrain and with the exception of the car of John Wahl suffered the same fate as the troop of Hannes Swanepoel. John Wahl then deployed in an excellent fire support position.\nThe first three vehicles got shot out. The fourth vehicle of Kees van der Linde returned fire with their co-axial Brownig machine gun and pinned the enemy down. At this stage Kees van der Linde's car broke down with a fuel line problem.\nKees managed to sort this out but got wounded in his legs in the process. This vehicle managed to withdraw back to the mortar position where it broke down again and Kees got seriously wounded for the second time. The 2IC car charged into the killing zone, after a call for help from Gert Botha and started the rescue attempt which saved the lives of at least eight more armoured members by drawing the fire away from them as the enemy would have shot the vehicles again and again. In the process they got shot out by various anti tank weapons. The first shot hit them on the muzzle-brake, the second took off the anti aircraft Browning and wounded Jaco Kriel over the top of his head and he sat down stunned for a minute or two. The car was thus useless as the co-axial Browning could not be reloaded by Kriel. John Wahl then knocked out the 76 mm and saved the crew of the 2IC car in the process. The 2IC car was now useless and withdrew but loaded the wounded Volgraaf on the front of their car and transported him back to the medical post. Bok Kriel however jumped out of the car, saw that Abrie Cloete abandonded his car and ran away. He took control of this car and together with John Wahl they continued with the rescue attempts.\n\nOver the next few hours a fierce exchange of fire took place. In the process John Wahl moved in and rescued Gert Botha. Bok Kriel also moved in and rescues Jaco Kotze. Again John Wahl moved in and rescued Giel Visser. This he did without his gunner as to make space for Giel and for all intent and purposes were thus unarmed.\nTaljaard was killed and Bok Kriel got wounded for the second time, in his neck.\n\nAll of these actions were launched on own initiative, without any orders been given and under death defying curcimstances because by then, the killing zone of the ambush was barraged by wave after wave of 122mm BM-21 multiple rocket launchers. This led to more than 80 (exact number unknown) casualties amongst the infantry which were surrogate forces in the form of FNLA and UNITA soldiers.\n\nA SAAF Cessna 185 spotter aircraft was shot down over Ebo the following day. This was the first tangible South African defeat of Operation Savannah.\n\nFollowing the ambush at Ebo, the South African \"Battle Group Foxbat\" began attempting to breach the Nhia River at \"Bridge 14\", a strategic crossing near the FAPLA headquarters north of Quibala. This ensuing Battle for Bridge 14 accounted for the many fierce actions fought by withdrawing Cuban and Angolan forces from the river inland to \"Top Hat\", a hill overlooking the southern approach to the bridge. In early December, \"Foxbat\" had infiltrated the hill with two artillery observers, who directed fire on FAPLA positions from a battery of BL 5.5-inch Medium Guns. This development forced Cuban commander Raúl Arguelles to call off an intended counter-offensive and order a redeployment via Ebo, instructing his units to withdraw from the Nhia. His subsequent death in a landmine explosion caused much confusion in some sectors of the defence line, with several of the defending units overlooking Bridge 14 as a result of a series of miscommunications. Meanwhile, South African sappers started repairing the bridge on December 11 despite heavy FAPLA opposition. By morning the Cuban situation had worsened with \"Foxbat\" advancing in full force. At about 7 AM, the defending troops came under attack. Heavy artillery pounded the northern banks, wiping out several mortar positions and at least one ammunition truck. The Cubans, supported by ZPU-4s and BM-21 Grads, covered the main road with Sagger wire-guided missiles to deter the South African advance. However, a column of twelve Eland-90 armoured cars supported by infantry broke through, skirting the road to confuse the missile teams, who had trained their weapons on the centre of the bridge.\n\nThe Elands swiftly engaged the remaining mortars with high-explosive shells, routing their crews. Twenty Cuban advisers were also dispatched when they attempted to overtake a Lieutenant van Vuuren's armoured car in the chaos, possibly mistaking it for an Angolan vehicle. Slowing to let the truck pass, van Vuuren promptly slammed a 90mm round into its rear – killing the occupants.\n\nIt was during this engagement that Danny Roxo single-handedly killed twelve FAPLA soldiers while conducting a reconnaissance of the bridge, an action for which he was awarded the Honoris Crux. A number of other South African military personnel were also decorated for bravery at Bridge 14, some posthumously. It is estimated that several hundred Cubans lost their lives during the attack; the SADF suffered 4 dead.\n\nThe events at Bridge 14 were subsequently dramatised by South Africa in the 1976 Afrikaans film Brug 14. The action was re-enacted using national servicemen. During the making of the film near Bethlehem in the OFS, Captain Douw Steyn was severely injured when a blank round from an Eland was accidentally fired and a piece of shrapnel removed his calf muscle. A useful rugby player, he went on to recover, and played one more match before hanging up the boots.\n\nOn December 10, the South African Task Force X-Ray followed the Benguela railway line from Silva Porto (Kuito) east to Luso, which they overran on the 10th December 1975. The South African contingent included an armoured squadron, supporting infantry units, some artillery, engineers, and UNITA irregulars. Their main objective was to seize the Luso airport, which later went on to serve as a supply point until the South Africans finally departed Angola in early January 1976.\n\nThere were numerous unrecorded clashes fought in the southwest between Colonel Jan Breytenbach's SADF battlegroup and scattered MPLA positions during Operation Savannah. Eventually, Breytenbach's men were able to advance three thousand kilometers over Angolan soil in thirty-three days.\n\nOn a related note, Battlegroup Zulu later formed the basis of South Africa's famous 32 Battalion.\n\nThe South African Navy was not planned to be involved in the hereunto land operation, but after a failed intervention by the South African Army in the Battle of Quifangondo, nevertheless had to hastily extract a number of army personnel by sea from far behind enemy lines in Angola, as well as abandoned guns. Ambrizete north of Luanda at was chosen as the pick-up point for the gunners involved in the defeat at Quifangondo. The frigates and went to the area, where the latter used inflatable boats and its Westland Wasp helicopter to extract 26 personnel successfully from the beach on 28 November 1975. The replenishment oiler provided logistical support to the frigates, and picked up the guns in Ambriz after they were towed to Zaire, and took them to Walvis Bay.\n\nGeneral Constand Viljoen, who had grave concerns at the time about the safety of both his soldiers and abandoned field guns, called it \"the most difficult night ever in my operational career\".\n\nThe success of this operation was exceptionally fortuitous, given that the South African Navy had been penetrated by the spy Dieter Gerhardt.\n\nSouth Africa continued to assist UNITA in order to ensure that SWAPO did not establish any bases in southern Angola.\n\nThe South African Defence Force acknowledged 28 dead and 100 wounded during Operation Savannah.\n\nThe South Africans deployed a number of Combat Groups during Operation Savannah – initially, only Combat Groups A and B were deployed, with the remaining groups being mobilised and deployed into Angola later in the campaign. There has been much dispute the overall size of Task Force Zulu. Current evidence indicates that the Task Force started with approximately 500 men and grew to a total of 2,900 with the formation of Battle Groups Foxbat, Orange and X-Ray.\n\nThe Savannah Association is an association of ex-servicemen of all units who were involved in the operation. They meet annually to commemorate the operation. The insignia of the association is a Caltrop.\n\n"}

{"id": "10885034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10885034", "title": "Pintupi Nine", "text": "Pintupi Nine\n\nThe Pintupi Nine were a group of nine Pintupi people who lived a traditional hunter-gatherer desert-dwelling life in Australia's Gibson Desert until 1984, when they made contact with their relatives near Kiwirrkurra. They are sometimes also referred to as \"the lost tribe\". The group were hailed as \"the last nomads\" in the international press when they left their nomadic life in October 1984.\n\nThe group roamed between waterholes near Lake Mackay, near the Western Australia-Northern Territory border, wearing hairstring belts and armed with wooden spears and spear throwers, and intricately carved boomerangs. Their diet was dominated by goanna and rabbit as well as bush food native plants. The group was a family, consisting of two co-wives (Nanyanu and Papalanyanu) and seven children. There were four brothers (Warlimpirrnga, Walala, Tamlik, and Piyiti) and three sisters (Yalti, Yikultji and Takariya). The boys and girls were all in their early-to-late teens, although their exact ages were not known; the mothers were in their late 30s.\n\nThe father – the husband of the two wives – died, possibly from eating spoiled canned foods found at an old mining exploration camp. After this, the group travelled south to where they thought their relatives might be, as they had seen 'smokes' in that direction. They encountered a man from Kiwirrkura but due to misunderstanding they fled back north while he returned to the community and alerted others who then travelled back with him to find the group. The community members quickly realised that the group were relatives who had been left behind in the desert twenty years earlier, when many had travelled into the missions nearer Alice Springs. The community members travelled by vehicle to where the group were last seen and then tracked them for some time before finding them. After making contact and establishing their relationships, the Pintupi nine were invited to come and live at Kiwirrkura, where most of them still reside.\n\nThe Pintupi-speaking trackers told them there was plenty of food, and water that came out of pipes; Yalti has said that this concept astounded them. Medical examination revealed that the Tjapaltjarri clan (as they are also known) were \"in beautiful condition. Not an ounce of fat, well proportioned, strong, fit, healthy\". At Kiwirrkura, near Kintore, they met with other members of their extended family.\n\nIn 1986, Piyiti went back to the desert. Warlimpirrnga, Walala, and Tamlik (now known as \"Thomas\") have gained international recognition in the art world as the Tjapaltjarri Brothers. The three sisters, Yalti, Yikultji and Takariya, are also well-known Aboriginal artists whose works can be seen on exhibition and purchased from a number of art dealers. One of the mothers has died; the other has settled with the three sisters in Kiwirrkurra.\n\n\n\n"}

Through the Foundation for Economic Education, Raico and his classmate George Reisman arranged to meet with economist Ludwig von Mises, who subsequently invited them to attend his graduate seminar on Austrian economics at New York University. There he met fellow seminar attendee Murray Rothbard, who befriended him. Rothbard and his friends Raico, Reisman, Ronald Hamowy, and Robert Hessen formed a \"self-conscious intellectual and activist salon\" they named the \"Circle Bastiat\".\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Circle Bastiat also brought Raico into contact with novelist Ayn Rand and her followers, informally known at the time as \"The Collective\". Raico attended the first lectures about Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. Eventually relations between the two groups soured, leading to an incident in which the Circle parodied the Collective, performing a skit in which Raico played the part of Rand's protege Nathaniel Branden. By the summer of 1958 Rand and Rothbard had broken off all ties, and the groups stopped associating.\n\nRaico received his B.A. from the City College of New York and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, where his adviser was Friedrich Hayek.\n\nWhile at the University of Chicago, Raico founded \"The New Individualist Review\", a libertarian publication which first published in April 1961 and produced 17 issues until it ceased publication in 1968. Raico and other graduate students comprised the editorial board. Hayek and Milton Friedman and later, economist George Stigler, were on the advisory board. In 1981, Friedman wrote that he believed the publication had \"set an intellectual standard which has not yet, I believe, been matched by any of the more recent publications in the same philosophical tradition.\"\n\nRaico later became senior editor of \"Inquiry\" magazine. He was an associate editor of \"The Independent Review\", a journal published by The Independent Institute, and a senior fellow of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, which published his work on the history of liberty and the connection between war and the state. Raico translated Mises' book, \"Liberalismus\" and various essays by Friedrich Hayek into English.\n\nRaico has spoken favorably of classical liberalism.\n\nOn foreign policy, Raico was in favor of non-interventionism.\n\nRaico died on December 13, 2016 at the age of 80.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He attended college for two years and worked as an electrician, when on August 18, 1941, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps in Lubbock, Texas. In 1943, Acord was a young test pilot stationed at Ladd Field, now Fort Wainwright, an Army post in Fairbanks. He flew planes with the Cold Weather Testing Station and experimented with heating systems and landing planes with skis. He left the then United States Air Force with the rank of major. Subsequently, he was awarded the Alaska-Siberia Lend Lease Award for his contributions to Russian-North American relations during World War II.\n\nAcord had a vast knowledge of aeronautics. He recorded an oral history of the technical details of his flights. His wife of fifty years, Marion Acord, who survived him, took detailed notes for the benefit of future researchers. Mike Cox, a former manager at Pioneer Park, which houses the aviation museum, said that Acord possessed a \"depth of knowledge about anything related to aviation . . . a treasure trove of information.\"\n\nAcord conceived the idea for the museum in the late 1970s when the military was considering closing Fort Wainwright. However, the post remains open. The museum opened to the public in 1992 after Acord spent thousands of dollars of his own money to overcome construction setbacks.\n\nAcord told the \"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner\" that \"There is so much history going away nowadays. People don't record events, and then they pass on, and it's gone. I would like to see this history passed on to the younger people of this country.\"\n\nAcord flew a small carrier for several years and went into business as a food distributor to outlying villages. He continued to fly until he was in his early eighties. He died in Fairbanks from complications of pneumonia.\n\nHe was a member of the Air Force Memorial Foundation, chaired by H. Ross Perot. He was a member of the Federal Aviation Administration \"Master Pilot Award List\".\n"}
