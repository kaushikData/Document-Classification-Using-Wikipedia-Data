Besides the immediate impact on the victims and their families, the attacks caused widespread anger among the Indian public, and condemnations from countries throughout the world.\n\nThe immediate impact was felt on Mumbai and Maharashtra state, and throughout urban India. There were also after-effects on the Indian government, centre-state relations within India, Indo-Pakistani relations, domestic impact within Pakistan, the United States's relationships with both countries, the US-led NATO war in Afghanistan, and on the Global War on Terror.\nThere was also impact on the region of Kashmir and this also led to the 2010 Kashmir Unrest.\n\nThe Leopold Cafe opened its doors to customers just four days after the attacks. The owners wanted to repair the damaged parts of the cafe, while retaining some of the damaged pieces as a tribute to those who lost their lives in the attacks.\n\nSecurity forces handed back control of the Taj Mahal Hotel to the Taj group on 1 December 2008, and work on its repairs began that same day. Celebrated artist M.F. Hussain, whose art was destroyed in the attacks, has agreed to replace the paintings with a series that will condemn the attack. Hussain plans this series as a tribute to the staff of the hotel, who laid down their lives to save other people.\n\nControl of the Trident has already been handed back to the management, while the Oberoi will take 3–4 months to resume operations. Both the Taj and Trident hotels reopened on 21 December 2008.\n\nNariman House will also reopen soon, but it is not known exactly when. Several young Chabad couples from all over the world have stepped forward to move to Mumbai and continue the movement's work.\n\nIn the aftermath of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, all schools and colleges, and most offices were closed. The Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange remained closed on 27 November 2008. Shooting of Bollywood films and TV series had also been halted in the city. Many international airlines temporarily discontinued operations to Mumbai, in the interest of passenger and crew safety.\n\nThe Indian Cricket League's ongoing tournament in Ahmedabad was canceled. The two remaining One Day Internationals of the seven match series between the visiting England cricket team and India were cancelled. The visiting team flew home, but returned to continue the test series. However, the venue of the second India-England test match, scheduled on 19–23 December, was shifted from Mumbai to Chennai. The inaugural Twenty20 Champions League, scheduled from 3 to 10 December, Mumbai being one of the host cities, was postponed. The attacks have brought into significance the issue of 379 Indian boats and 336 fishermen apprehended by the Pakistan marine agency, for entering their waters. Nearly 200 of the boats have reportedly been auctioned, now recognised as a national security issue for India. On 28 November, Pakistan released 99 fishermen who were apprehended, as part of confidence building measures with India. There were threats to blow up ITC Fortune Hotel in Navi Mumbai, after Mumbai police received a bomb threat from terrorists. Rumours about further shootings at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus were doing the rounds in Mumbai on 28 November, and were widely reported by the news channels. The Railway Police denied these rumours, but stopped trains approaching CST.\n\nAfter seeing the disparity between the quality of helmets and bulletproof vests used by NSG commandos and the police, the Police Commissioner of Pune, Satyapal Singh, said his police officers needed the same quality equipment as used by the NSG to reduce deaths and improve performance.\n\nMaharashtra government has planned to buy 36 speed boats to patrol the coastal areas, and several helicopters for the same purpose. It will also create an Anti-Terror force known as the Force One, and it will upgrade all the weapons that Mumbai Police currently have.\n\nThe CST railway station was upgraded with metal detectors, but reports say that these are ineffective because the attendants cannot hear their beeps in the crowd. Civilians have tested these using their own licensed weapons.\n\nMaharashtra's new Home Minister, Jayant Patil, was forced to defend the performance of the police in the legislative assembly, against demands from the opposition parties for resignations from the police chief and other officials.\n\nIn an attempt to take forward the 26/11 probe, the Mumbai Police will send a three members team to the United States in this regard, sources said. The team comprising Inspector Bharti, Inspector Kadam and Inspector Arun Chavan will share the findings of the 26 November 2008 Mumbai attacks, with apex US investigative agency FBI. Mumbai police have sent a proposal to the Home Ministry, stating the need to establish direct contact with the FBI, to facilitate investigation in the Mumbai terror attacks. It is believed that the team, if permitted to go, will share the evidence gathered by Mumbai police, which prove Pakistan's hand in the attacks on the nation's integrity.\n\nA Cabinet Committee on Security meeting was held on Tuesday, 2 December, to discuss expanding the National Security Guards (NSG) to cities outside Delhi. The aim is to have permanent presence of NSG anti-terrorist squads in cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata, to avoid wasting precious time travelling from Delhi.\n\nAll NSG commandos will now undergo a new module of training, to learn how to deal with future anti-siege operations, because the Taj terrorists were in a gun battle for 59 hours continuously.\n\nPrime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, on an all party conference, declared that legal framework will be strengthened in the battle against terrorism and a federal anti-terrorist intelligence and investigation agency, like the FBI, will soon be set up to co-ordinate actions against terrorism. On 17 December, the Lok Sabha approved two new anti-terror bills, which are expected to pass the upper house (Rajya Sabha) on the 19th. One sets up a National Investigation Agency, similar to the FBI, with sweeping powers of investigation. The second strengthens existing anti-terror laws, to allow suspects to be detained without bail for up to six months, on the orders of a judge.\n\nThe \"National Investigation Agency Bill, 2008\", sets up a central agency for investigating terrorism related crimes. However, law and order is a state subject in the Constitution of India, which had made such a law difficult to pass in the past.\n\nUnion Home Minister P. Chidambaram assured parliament that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) did not usurp the States' right in any manner. The central government would make use of its power only under \"extraordinary\" circumstances, and depending on the gravity of the situation, he said. \"The agency will also have the powers to return the investigations to the State, if it so thinks. We have struck a balance between the right of the States and duties of the Centre to investigate.\"\n\nThe attacks have damaged India's already strained relationship with Pakistan. India handed over two demarches to Pakistan—one was submitted at the Foreign Office in Islamabad by Indian High Commissioner Satyabrata Pal. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Shahid Malik on 1 December 2008, to lodge a formal protest over Pakistan's failure to curb terrorism emanating from its soil. According to the Indian External Affairs Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, India, in the demarches to Pakistan, asked for the arrest and handover of those 20 persons, including gangster Dawood Ibrahim, the founder of Jaish-e-Mohammad, terrorist leader Maulana Masood Azhar and Lashkar-e-Taiba, and chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, who are settled in Pakistan and who are fugitives of Indian law. The external affairs minister has also stated that India will await Pakistan’s response. He has not ruled out the option of military strikes against terrorist camps in Pakistan.\n\nOn 28 November, a hoax caller pretending to be the Indian Foreign Minister threatened Pakistan President Zardari with war, leading to the Pakistan military being put in high alert. Military aircraft with live ammunition were scrambled to patrol above Islamabad and Rawalpindi. \n\nIndia's claims that the perpetrators were Pakistan-based were consistently denied by Pakistan. Pakistan initially contested this attribution, but agreed this was the case on 7 January 2009. The Indian government supplied a dossier to Pakistan's high commission in Delhi, containing interrogations, weapons, and call records of conversations during the attacks. Shown to friendly governments and media, it provides a detailed sequence of training, supplying, and constant communications with handlers from Pakistan. The Pakistan government dismissed the dossier as \"not evidence\", but also announced that it had detained over a hundred members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a charity linked with Lashkar-e-Taiba. Moreover, Indian government officials said that the attacks were so sophisticated that they must have had official backing from Pakistani \"agencies\". an accusation denied by Pakistan.\n\nAt the request of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Ahmad Shuja Pasha, was reported to be coming to India to share intelligence and help the investigation, but later on it was decided by Pakistani authorities that instead of Director General of the ISI, his representative will visit India to help the Indian government in the investigations.\n\nIndia handed over two demarches to Pakistan – one was submitted at the Foreign Office in Islamabad by Indian High Commissioner Satyabrata Pal. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Shahid Malik on 1 December 2008, to lodge a formal protest against Pakistan's inaction against terrorist groups operating within the country.\n\nThe Indian foreign ministry released a statement, describing the actions it expects Islamabad to take. \"It was conveyed to the Pakistan high commissioner that Pakistan's actions needed to match the sentiments expressed by its leadership, that it wishes to have a qualitatively new relationship with India,\" the statement said. \"He was informed that the recent terrorist attack on Mumbai was carried out by elements from Pakistan. Government expects that strong action would be taken against those elements, whosoever they may be, responsible for this outrage,\" it said.\n\nThe CNN-IBN reported that India had asked Pakistan to hand over Mumbai Underworld Don Dawood Ibrahim, Lashkar-e-Toiba chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed and Jaish-e-Mohammed leader Maulana Masood Azhar for their suspected involvement in the Mumbai terror attack.\n\nDawood, India’s most wanted criminal, is suspected to have helped the LeT terrorists who attacked Mumbai on 26 November. Azhar, founder of the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad, is on India's most wanted list of people it accuses of terrorism. India freed Azhar from prison in exchange for passengers on a hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814 in 1999.\n\n\"Times of India\", quoting Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, reported: \"Now, we have in our demarche asked (for) the arrest and handover of those persons who are settled in Pakistan and who are fugitives of Indian law\"\n\n\"...there are lists of about 20 persons. (These) lists are sometimes altered and this exercise is going on and we have renewed it in our demarche\", Mukherjee said, adding that India \"will await\" Pakistan's response in the Indian-Arab forum.\n\nIn an interview with NDTV, Pranab Mukherjee had not ruled out the option of military strikes against terror camps in Pakistan. Mukherjee said that every country has the right to protect its territorial integrity, and take appropriate action when necessary. He also said that it has become difficult to continue the peace process with Pakistan in this.\n\nPakistan claimed that it had not received any letter from Mohammad Ajmal Amir, the lone terrorist arrested for the Mumbai attacks, seeking legal aid. It also repeated its denial on his Pakistani nationality, saying it needed \"incontrovertible\" evidence.\n\nThe Mumbai police had said that the captured terrorist Ajmal Amir had written a letter to the Pakistan High Commission in India, asking for help, and that the letter had been given to India's central government. But the Pakistan High Commissioner to India, Shahid Malik, told Karan Thapar in the \"India Tonight\" program of CNBC TV-18, that no such letter had been received.\n\nAccording to Pakistan's \"Dawn\" newspaper, Ajmal's father in Pakistan had admitted that the man seen in photographs at the CST railway station was indeed his son. But the High Commissioner said they needed \"something which is incontrovertible, which cannot be challenged in a court of law\".\n\nPakistan was also not contemplating giving Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, access to the FBI for investigation.\n\nShortly after the Mumbai attacks, the Interpol team visited India and \"promised help in securing the details of the 10 gunmen who attacked several places in Mumbai, 26 November, leaving at least 173 people dead and more than 300 others injured\".\n\nInterpol Secretary General Ronald Noble arrived in Islamabad on Tuesday, 23 December, for talks over Indian allegations of involvement with Pakistan-based militant groups in the Mumbai terror attacks. Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble met Pakistan's security officials the same day.\n\nHowever, in a later press-conference, the Interpol chief said that India didn't share any specific information with the Interpol regarding the terror attacks. He said that Interpol had the same information that had been with media and the general public. Pakistan's Minister for Information and Broadcasting Sherry Rehman claimed that this statement somehow supported Pakistan government's stance that Indian government has yet to share substantial and credible evidence with them, and again offered help in due cooperation to India, for joint investigations into the Mumbai attacks.\n\nOn 10 March, India gave Interpol the DNA of the attackers.\n\nOn 7 December, US Senator John McCain relayed a message from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, to a group of Pakistanis at a lunch in Lahore, that if Pakistan did not arrest those involved with the attacks, India would begin aerial attacks against Pakistan.\n\nPakistan Information Minister Sherry Rehman said that \"Our air force is on alert, and ready to face any eventuality\". Ali Abbas Rizvi quoted a source as saying, \"They [India] may have wanted to know whether the PAF was on five-minute alert or cockpit alert, and thereby find out the reaction time\".\n\nOn 19 December, private intelligence agency Stratfor, in its latest report, said, \"Indian military operations against targets in Pakistan have in fact been prepared, and await the signal to go forward\". They also wrote that, \"Indian military preparations, unlike previous cases, will be carried out in stealth\". India's Border Security Force (BSF) has been put on high alert on the western sector, as well as the eastern sector, in order to prevent terrorist infiltration.\n\nOn 22 December, Pakistan began combat air patrol (CAP) over several cities, including Islamabad, Lahore, and Rawalpindi, which began a panic among Pakistani civilians. Many Pakistani civilians \"started making frantic phone calls to media house[s] to enquire about whether a war has been declared\". Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said, \"Pakistan defence forces and armed forces are ready to face any challenge, as Pak has the full right to defend itself\". Pakistani PM Yousuf Raza Gilani said, \"Pakistan remains united and is ready to fight anyone to defend itself\". Pakistani Defense Minister Ahmad Mukhtar Chaudhry said, \"If India tried to thrust war, then the armed forces of Pakistan have all the potential and right to defend [Pakistan]\".\n\nAccording to Pakistani media, India had started deploying troops along the Rajasthan border, and had tightened security in and around the defence airstrips. More radars and quick reaction teams were then deployed along the India-Pakistan border. Indian forces were on regular firing exercises at locations, like Lathi Firing Range in Jaisalmer, Mahsan in Bikaner, Suratgarh and Ganganagar.\n\nOn 23 December, Kamal Hyder, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Pakistan, wrote that the Pakistani \"navy, air force and army were on red alert\" and that \"the chiefs of Pakistan's three armed forces were holding what had been described as an emergency meeting at general headquarters in Rawalpindi\". He also wrote that \"[t]he Pakistani air force have been seen visibly in a number of locations flying close to the Pakistani-India border, in what is being described as an aggressive patrolling mode, following reports that India is planning pre-emptive strikes against locations in Pakistan\". A Pakistani airforce spokesperson said \"[i]n view of the current environment, the PAF has enhanced its vigilance\". Pakistani army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, said that Pakistan would mount an equal response \"within minutes\", to any Indian attack. Pakistan continued to combat air patrol over several cities.\n\nThe Taliban and affiliated groups openly declared their solidarity with Pakistan. The banned Tehrik-e-Taliban had proclaimed that they would send \"thousands of (their) well-armed militants\" in order to wage jihad against India if war should break out. Hundreds of would-be bombers were equipped with suicide jackets and explosive-laden vehicles.\n\nOn 24 December, P.K. Barbora, the air officer commanding-in-chief of Western Air Command, said \"[t]he IAF has earmarked 5,000 targets in Pakistan. But whether we will cross the LoC or the International Border to hit the enemy targets will have to be decided by the political leadership of the country\". India Today reported that \"Indian Air Force fighter planes are engaged in round the clock sorties. An unusual hectic activity of Indian Air Force has been visible along the border for past some days\". On the same day, Stratfor confirmed that \"the state government of Rajasthan has ordered residents of its border villages to be prepared for relocation\". President Asif Ali Zardari said \"We will defend the country till the last drop of our blood\", and \"[w]e will defend the country till our last breath\". Pakistan began deploying warplanes to forward air bases.\n\nOn 25 December, however, the ruling UPA government in India played down apprehensions of an imminent military conflagration. The Indian Prime Minister made it clear that \"nobody wanted war\". The Indian Air Force also downplayed the sorties by PAF fighter jets, saying it was an air defence exercise. Officials in New Delhi were amused at Pakistan air force's attempt to create war hysteria in the region. However, R. C. Dhyani, DIG of Rajasthan frontier BSF, said, \"[a] lot of military movement is being noticed in districts just across the international border for the last few days, which is not normal\" and \"Pakistan has deployed more troops across border\".\n\nLeader of the House Raza Rabbani, said that any surgical strike into its territory would be taken as an act of war and would be repulsed with \"full force\", and that \"[e]ach and every inch of the country will be safeguarded\". India moved MiG-29s to Hindon air base, located near New Delhi, in order \"to protect the capital from aerial threats\". The Pakistani city of Mianwali began a blackout.\n\nPakistan continued deployment, and moved the 10th Brigade to the outskirts of Lahore, and the 3rd Armored Brigade to Jhelum. The 10th Infantry Division and the 11th Infantry Division had been placed on high alert. The Indian Army deployed quick reaction teams (QRTs) along the border, which \"precede the movement of bridging equipment – to cross canals in Punjab – and of heavy guns\".\n\nAmir Mir of \"Daily News and Analysis\" wrote that \"Pakistan's military leadership has advised president Asif Ali Zardari to take back his statement made last month, that his country would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the event of a conflict with India\".\n\nOn 26 December, Pakistan cancelled all military leave, and activated contacts with friendly countries and military partners. Pakistan deployed troops to \"protect vital points along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and the international border with India\". Pakistani Foreign Minister Quresh said that, \"if war is imposed, we will respond to it like a brave, self-respecting nation\". Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held a second meeting of the Nuclear Command Authority to \"discuss all the options available to India\".\n\nPakistan deployed the 14th Infantry Division to Kasur and Sialkot, close to the border. India advised its citizens not to travel to Pakistan. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with the chiefs of the Indian air force, army, and navy.\n\nOn 27 December, India's largest opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), called for all travel between India and Pakistan to be stopped, and for the recall of the Indian High Commissioner from Pakistan. The Pakistani Army alerted retired army personnel to be ready to be called back to active duty. On 28 December, Pakistan postponed all officer training courses.\n\nOn 29 December, the leaders of the Indian and Pakistani armies spoke over their red telephone, in order to avert an accidental nuclear war. The President of the BJP, Rajnath Singh, called for a joint India-US military action against Pakistan. John McCain said, \"The Indians are on the verge of some kind of attack on Pakistan\".\n\nOn 30 December, Pakistani media stated: \"The service chiefs of all of the branches of India's military were told to stay in the country in order to achieve 'complete readiness'. All units that are on exercises have been ordered to remain so indefinitely, and to indicate any equipment or ammunition they need\". However, this was not backed by Indian nor international media.\n\nThe Pakistani military had cancelled all leave. Elements of the Pakistani Airforce had been deployed to frontline bases. The IV Corp, with 60,000 troops, has been deployed to Lahore. Pakistan had deployed the 3rd Armored Brigade to Jhelum, and the 10th Brigade, with 5,000 troops, to Lahore. The 10th Division had been deployed to Ichogul and the 11th Division had been deployed to Tilla. Pakistani Army units had been deployed to Kashmir and the Jammu sector of the border. The 14th Division, with 20,000 troops, had been deployed to Kasur and Sialkot.\n\nIndia had put its Border Security Force, India's border patrol agency, on high alert. Mig-29s have been deployed to Hindon air base, in order to protect New Delhi. Later IAF sources claimed that the move was a result of intelligence inputs of an air attack on Delhi. The Indian Navy had moved six warships, including the INS \"Jalashwa\" and the INS \"Ranveer\", to the west coast.\n\nIndian and Pakistani police had exchanged DNA evidence, photographs, and items found with the attackers, to piece together a detailed portrait of the Mumbai plot. Police in Pakistan had arrested seven people, including Hammad Amin Sadiq, a homoeopathic pharmacist, who arranged bank accounts and secured supplies, and he and six others began their formal trial on 3 October 2009, in Pakistan, though Indian authorities say the prosecution stopped well short of top Lashkar leaders.\n\nUS officials feared that should the firm evidence emerge that the Mumbai terror attacks were planned and directed from within Pakistan, it would certainly escalate tension between the neighbouring countries, and could also provoke an Indian military response, even strikes against terrorists, a media report said on Saturday. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, on Monday, urged Pakistan to give its \"absolute, total\" cooperation in finding those responsible for last week's attacks on Mumbai. Rice travelled to India on 4 December 2008, at the request of President George W. Bush, in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. She said that there is need for \"direct and tough action\" by Islamabad, even if the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks were \"non-state actors\".\n\"Secretary Rice's visit to India is a further demonstration of the United States' commitment to stand in solidarity with the people of India, as we all work together to hold these extremists accountable\", White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a statement.\n\nAfter visiting India, Condoleezza Rice travelled to Pakistan on 4 December 2008, to talk with the Pakistani government. She is quoted as saying, \"We talked at length about the importance of Pakistan taking its responsibility to deal with those who may use Pakistan territory even if they are non-state actors\".\n\nHowever, some of the most wanted names on the list continue to operate openly in Pakistan. No action has been taken against them by the government of Pakistan.\n\nPolice forces in places like New York and Boston practised handling of similar situations, should they occur in the US.\n\nIn the wake of the attacks, a new system of compensation for UK citizens caught up in terrorist attacks is being considered. However, \"currently the UK government does not guarantee compensation for people injured in attacks abroad\".\n\nUK police feared similar attacks could occur in the country.\n\nThe Mumbai attack also triggered a chain of citizens' movements across India. People from all walks of life hit the streets with candles and placards to pay tributes to the victims of the tragedy almost every weekend after the 26/11 incident. While NSG commandos, Mumbai police officials, hotel staffers, etc. who participated in the operation to eliminate the terrorists became overnight heroes, the wrath of the citizens was directed towards the Government's inability to ensure adequate security to its citizens, and soon led to the chain of resignations, including that of the Indian Home Minister, Shivraj Patil. The gathering of citizens at the Gateway of India in Mumbai was unprecedented and historic. From India Gate and Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to marketplaces and street corners all across the country, India witnessed candlelight vigils by the common people. Some organised initiatives to carry forward the citizens' movement included a Hindustan Times-CNN-IBN Initiative, India Today Group's War Against Terror, and Hindustan Hamara Citizens' Initiative, besides a large number of blogs on the issue.\n\nOn 25 February 2009, new videos were released off of CCTV, displaying the inside of the hotel where the Mumbai siege took place.\n\n"}

They seem to be identical with the \"Asturicani\" of Ptolemy (v. 9. § 7).\n\nThe Aspurgiani inhabited the region called Sindica, between Phanagoria and Gorgippia, among the Maeotae, Sindi, Dandarii, Toreatae, Agri, Arrechi, Tarpetes, Obidiaceni, Sittaceni and Dosci, among others.

These tribes were first mentioned in Strabo's works as the group who killed Polemo when he launched a treacherous attack. An account cited that these tribes were more of a political party or a military colony rather than a tribe, having been founded by a person called Aspurgus, who once was a king of the Bosporan kingdom. \n\n"}

It attempted to compensate for previous methods' problems with contrast. Brewster introduced a three color process in 1935, in an unsuccessful attempt to compete with Technicolor.\n\nIn his first patent application, filed February 11, 1913, American inventor Percy Douglas Brewster described a new color film process:\n\nOver the next eight years, Brewster filed a series of further patents pertaining to photographic film, film development, color cinematography, and various improvements to the process. In 1917, a patent for a method of \"Coloring or Dyeing Photographic Images\" was issued to Hoyt Miller, chief chemist of the Brewster Color Film Corporation, and assigned to the corporation.\n\nBrewster's process was used for the first color animated cartoon, 1920's \"The Debut of Thomas Cat\". However the production company, Bray Pictures, deemed the process to be too expensive, and did not employ it again.\n\nAs other color processes became available, Brewster Color continued to be preferred by some filmmakers due to its relatively low cost and greater availability for small production runs. It began to fall out of use in the late 1920s, in favor of the Prizma process.\n\nIn April 1944, a syndicate was formed to purchase the rights to the Brewster Color process and use it to produce films at studios in New York and Washington D.C. Stanley Neal, member of the syndicate and owner of its laboratory, was mainly known for the production of industrial films and advertising shorts.\n\nIn 1935, Brewster introduced a three color process which added yellow tinting. Though demonstration films received praise from members of the Royal Photographic Society for their \"remarkable steadiness\" and \"extraordinarily good reds\", this method failed to meet with commercial success.\n\nBrewster filed a lawsuit against Technicolor, Inc. and Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation on April 1, 1941. It sought $100,000 in damages and an injunction, stating that they had infringed on patents for a \"method and apparatus for color cinematography.\" On October 7, 1941, the judge overruled defense objections to some of the plaintiff's interrogatories. This procedural decision has been cited in some subsequent cases, as \"2 F.R.D. 186, 51 U.S.P.Q. 319\".\n\nNo further public filings were made by Brewster, suggesting that the case may have been settled out of court.\n\n\n"}

Together with 115 other African captives, he was brought illegally to the United States on board the ship \"Clotilda\" in 1860. They were landed in the backwaters near Mobile, Alabama, and hidden from authorities. The ship was scuttled to evade discovery.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Lewis and other members of the \"Clotilda\" group became free and established a community at Magazine Point, north of Mobile, Alabama. Now designated as the Africatown Historic District, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. In old age Lewis preserved the experiences of the \"Clotilda\" captives by providing accounts of the history of the group to visitors, including Mobile artist and author Emma Langdon Roche and author and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston.\n\nHe was born as Kossola or Oluale Kossola (American listeners would later transcribe his given name as \"Kazoola\"), around 1840 in West Africa. Analyzing names and the other words attributed to the Africatown founders, historian Sylviane Diouf has concluded that he and many other members of the community belonged to what is now known as the Yoruba ethnic group, and lived in the Banté region of what is now Benin. His father was named Oluwale (or Oluale) and his mother Fondlolu; he had five full siblings and twelve half-siblings, the children of his father's other two wives. Interviewers Roche and Hurston, and those who used their work, referred to Lewis and his fellow-captives as \"Tarkars.\" Diouf believes that the term \"Tarkar\" might have come from a misunderstanding of the name of a local king, or the name of a town.\n\nDuring April or May 1860, Lewis was taken prisoner by the army of the Kingdom of Dahomey as part of its annual dry-season raids for slaves. Along with other captives, he was taken to the slaving port of Ouidah and sold to Captain William Foster of the \"Clotilda\", a ship based in Mobile, Alabama, and owned by businessman Timothy Meaher. Although importation of enslaved persons into the United States had been illegal since 1808, Meaher may have believed that he could flout the law without consequences. Some reports suggest that breaking the law was part of Meaher's motivation for importing the slaves, as he reportedly bet a businessman $100,000 that he could circumvent the prohibition on transporting slaves. In a similar situation, the owners of the \"Wanderer,\" which had illegally brought a cargo of enslaved people to Georgia in 1858, were indicted and tried for piracy in the federal court in Savannah in May 1860 but acquitted in a jury trial. By the time the \"Clotilda\" reached the Mississippi coast in July 1860, government officials had been alerted to its activities, and Timothy Meaher, his brother Burns, and their associate John Dabney were charged with illegal possession of the captives. However, there was a gap of almost five months between the end of July 1860, when summonses and writs of seizure were issued against the Meahers and Dabney, and mid-December when they received them. During the intervening period the captives were dispersed and hidden, and without their physical presence as evidence the case was dismissed in January 1861.\n\nUntil the end of the Civil War (1861–65), Lewis and his fellows lived as \"de facto\" slaves of Meaher, his brothers, or their associates. Lewis was purchased by James Meaher, for whom he worked as a deckhand on a steamer. During this time he became known as \"Cudjo Lewis.\" He later explained that he suggested \"Cudjo,\" a day-name commonly given to boys born on a Monday, as an alternative to his given name when James Meaher had difficulty pronouncing \"Kossola.\" Historian Diouf posits that the surname \"Lewis\" was a corruption of his father's name Oluale, sharing the \"lu\" sound; in his homeland, the closest analogue to what Americans understood as a surname would have been a patronymic.\n\nDuring their time in slavery, Lewis and many of the other \"Clotilda\" captives were located at an area north of Mobile known as Magazine Point, the Plateau, or \"Meaher's hammock,\" where the Meahers owned a mill and a shipyard. Although only three miles from the town of Mobile, it was isolated, separated from the city by a swamp and a forest, and easily accessible only by water. After the abolition of slavery and the end of the Civil War, the \"Clotilda\" captives tried to raise money to return to their homeland. The men worked in lumber mills and the women raised and sold produce, but these occupations did not allow them to acquire sufficient funds. After realizing that they would not be able to return to Africa, the group deputized Lewis to ask Timothy Meaher for a grant of land. When he refused, the members of the community continued to raise money and began to purchase land around Magazine Point. On September 30, 1872, Lewis bought about two acres of land in the Plateau area for $100.00.\n\nAfricatown developed as a self-contained community. The group appointed leaders to enforce communal norms derived from their shared African background, and developed institutions including a church, a school, and a cemetery. Diouf explains that Africatown was unique because it was both a \"black town,\" inhabited exclusively by people of African ancestry, and an enclave of people born in another country. She writes, \"Black towns were safe havens from racism, but African Town was a refuge from Americans.\" Writing in 1914, Emma Langdon Roche noted that the surviving founders of Africatown preferred to speak in their own language among themselves. She described the English of adults as \"very broken and not always intelligible even to those who have lived among them for many years.\" However, the residents also adopted some American customs, including Christianity. Lewis converted in 1869, joining a Baptist church.\n\nDuring the mid-1860s Lewis established a common-law relationship with another \"Clotilda\" survivor, Abile (Americanized as \"Celia\"). They formally married on March 15, 1880, along with several other couples from Africatown. They remained together until Abile's death in 1905.\n\nThey had six children, five sons and a daughter, to each of whom they gave both an African name and an American name. Their eldest son, Aleck (or Elick) Iyadjemi, became a grocer; he brought his wife to live in a house on his father's land. Diouf describes this arrangement as a Yoruba-style \"family compound.\" Another son, Cudjoe Feïchtan, was fatally shot by a sheriff's deputy in 1902. Lewis outlived all of his children as well as his wife. He allowed his daughter-in-law Mary Wood Lewis, his grandchildren, and eventually her second husband Joe Lewis (no relation) to remain in their house in the compound.\n\nLewis worked as a farmer and laborer until 1902, when his buggy was damaged and he was injured in a collision with a train in Mobile. As he was then unable to work, the community appointed him as sexton of the church. In 1903 it took the name of the Union Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nAlthough native-born American former slaves became citizens upon the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in July 1868, this change in status did not apply to the members of the \"Clotilda\" group, who were foreign-born. Cudjo Kazoola Lewis became a naturalized American citizen on October 24, 1868.\n\nLewis utilized the American legal system in 1902 after his injury in the buggy-train collision. After the Louisville and Nashville Railroad refused to pay damages, he hired an attorney, sued the railroad, and won a significant settlement of $650.00. The award was overturned on appeal.\n\nIn the first quarter of the 20th century, Lewis began to serve as an informant for scholars and other writers, sharing the history of the \"Clotilda\" Africans and traditional stories and tales. Emma Langdon Roche, a Mobile-based writer and artist, interviewed Lewis and the other survivors for her 1914 book \"Historic Sketches of the South.\" She described their capture in Africa, enslavement, and lives in Africatown. They requested that she use their African names in her work, in the hope that it might reach their homeland \"where some might remember them.\"\n\nBy 1925, Lewis was the last African survivor of the \"Clotilda;\" he was interviewed by educator and folklorist Arthur Huff Fauset of Philadelphia. In 1927 Fauset published two of Lewis' animal tales, \"T'appin's magic dipper and whip\" and \"T'appin fooled by Billy Goat's eyes,\" and \"Lion Hunt,\" his autobiographical account about hunting in Africa, in the \"Journal of American Folklore.\"\nIn 1927 Lewis was interviewed by the folklorist Zora Neale Hurston. The next year she published an article, \"Cudjoe's Own Story of the Last African Slaver\" (1928). According to her biographer Robert E. Hemenway, this piece largely plagiarized Emma Roche's work, although Hurston added information about daily life in Lewis' home village of Banté. In 1928 Hurston returned with additional resources; she conducted more interviews, took photographs, and recorded what is the only known film footage of an African who had been trafficked to the United States through the slave trade. Based on this material, she wrote a manuscript, \"Barracoon,\" which Hemenway described as \"a highly dramatic, semifictionalized narrative intended for the popular reader.\" After this round of interviews, Hurston's literary patron, philanthropist Charlotte Osgood Mason, learned of Lewis and began to send him money for his support. Lewis was also interviewed by journalists for local and national publications. Hurston's book \"\" was finally published on May 8, 2018.\n\nCudjo Lewis died July 17, 1935, and was buried at the Plateau Cemetery in Africatown. Since his death, his status as the last survivor of the \"Clotilda\" and the written record created by his interviewers have made him a public figure of the history of the community.\n\n\n\n"}

York, Issa Al Haadi Al Mahdi, Dr. York, \"et alii\", is an American musician and writer who is known as the founding leader of various religious/political groups, including most notably the cult Nuwaubian movement. He is a convicted child molester.\n\nHe and his group were based in Brooklyn, New York. Around 1990 the community relocated to rural Putnam County, Georgia, where they built a large complex. York was convicted in 2004 of child molestation and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. He is serving a 135-year sentence.\n\nYork began his ministry in the late 1960s. In 1967 he was preaching to the \"Ansaaru Allah\" (viz. African Americans) in Brooklyn, New York, during the period of the Black Power movement. He founded numerous orders under various names during the 1970s and 1980s. These were at first based on pseudo-Islamic themes and Judaism (Nubian Islamic Hebrews). Later he developed a theme derived from \"Ancient Egypt,\" mixing ideas taken from black nationalism, cryptozoological and UFO religions, and popular conspiracy theory. He last called his group the United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors, or Nuwabians.\n\nYork and the Nuwaubians came under scrutiny in the early 1990s, after they built \"Tama-Re,\" an Egyptian-themed \"city\" for about a hundred of his followers, in rural Putnam County, Georgia. Before York's trial, the community had been joined directly and in the area by hundreds of other followers from out of state, while alienating both black and white local residents. The community was intensively investigated after numerous reports that York had molested numerous children of his followers.\n\nYork was arrested in May 2002. In 2004 he was convicted on federal charges of transporting minors across state lines for the purposes of sexual molestation, as well as racketeering and financial reporting violations. York's case was reported as the largest prosecution for child molestation ever directed at a single person in the history of the United States, both in terms of number of victims and number of incidents.\n\nAccording to a birth certificate issued in the United States, Dwight D. York was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Other sources give his birthplace as New Jersey, New York, Baltimore, or Takoradi, Ghana.\n\nYork says that he was raised in Massachusetts, and at the age of seven went to Aswan, Egypt to learn about Islam. \"My grandfather, As Sayyid Abdur Rahman Al Mahdi, the Imaam of the Ansaars in the Sudan until 1959 AD, upon looking into my eyes foretold that I was the one who would possess 'the light.'\" He says he returned to the United States in 1957 at age 12 and continued to study Islam. As an adolescent, he moved with his family to Teaneck, New Jersey.\n\nIn the late 1960s York, calling himself \"Imaam Isa\", combined elements of the Moorish Science Temple of America, the Nation of Islam, the Nation of Gods and Earths and Freemasonry, and founded a quasi-Muslim black nationalist movement and community. He called it \"Ansaar Pure Sufi,\" or the \"Ansaaru Allah Community,\" c. 1970. He instructed members to wear black and green dashikis.\n\nHe later changed his name to \"Imaam Isa Abdullah,\" and renamed his \"Ansaar Pure Sufi\" ministry to the \"Nubians\" in Brooklyn in 1967. The group was considered to be part of the Black Hebrews phenomenon, under the name \"Nubian Islaamic Hebrews\". Unlike other groups, they were not Judeo-Christian but Judeo-Islamic. and \"Nubian Hebrew Mission\" as of 1969 This was also the period of Black Power among some African Americans.\n\nYork later traveled to Africa, to Sudan and Egypt in particular. He met and persuaded members of Mohamed Ahmed Al-Mahdi's family to finance him to set up a cell of their organization in the United States. This was to be a \"west\" or \"American\" political wing of Sudan's Ansar movement under Sadiq al-Mahdi (also see Umma Party). He began to develop the claim of his \"Sudanese\" roots in order to authenticate his American branch of the sect.\n\nAfter York returned from a pilgrimage to (Egypt and Sudan), he invited Sadiq Al-Mahdi to the US. In 1970 his group changed its name to the \"Ansaaru Allah Community in the West.\" A 1993 FBI report described this group as a \"front for a wide range of criminal activity, including arson, welfare fraud and extortion.\"\n\nThe group wrote:\n\nThe women of the Ansaaru Allah Community focus on memorizing history as their Imam sees it, learning Arabic (many of them are quite fluent), incorporating Sudanese etiquette into their mannerisms and memorizing the Qur'an. They participate in the compilation of the various texts produced by the community and also work in the recording studio owned by the community. Other than this work, the women's main source of income comes from US government public assistance and monies earned by the men in various enterprises such as food shops, jewelry and merchandise stores, and street vending.\n\nThe \"New York Press\" reported on York:\n\nHe was based in Coney Island for a time, and operated a bookstore and a printing press on Flatbush Ave. in the 70s. In the 80s he was based in Brooklyn, on Bushwick Ave. York's students are best remembered by New Yorkers as practitioners of orthodox Islam – members of certain New York Five Percent Nation, Nation of Islam and Arab Islamic mosques still regard the Nuwaubians as a rival faction – but at different times they followed the paths of Christianity and Judaism. Operations relocated to Liberty, near the Catskills, around 1991, then to Georgia in 1993.\n\nThe community in Brooklyn, reported as identifying as the \"Holy Tabernacle of the Most High\" and also as the \"Children of Abraham,\" was said to be led by Rabboni Y'shua Bar El Haady. They practiced a mixture of Judaism and Islam. They were reported as numbering about 300 persons and in 1994 the group reportedly still owned nine apartment buildings, of which five were in tax arrears. Local politicians were concerned that the abandoned buildings would become centers of uses that would damage the neighborhood. Anecdotal reports were that some of the group went to Monroe County, New York, and others to Georgia.\n\nIn the early 1980s, York had performed as vocalist with his own groups, known as Jackie and the Starlights, the Students, and Passion.\n\nHe launched his own record label, named Passion Productions, recording as the solo artist \"Dr. York.\" His debut release was the single \"Only a Dream\" (later included in the album \"New York,\" Hot Melt Records UK, 1985). \"Dr. York\" and Passion Productions were advertised in the May 4, 1985 issue of \"Billboard\" magazine.\n\nBackground vocals were by Ted Mills of the group Blue Magic. York said he performed popular music in order to \"reach a mass majority of my people through my music.\"\n\nYork's groups had a variety of names and functions: quasi-religious, fraternal, and tribal. They were called \"Holy Tabernacle Ministries\", \" Church of Karast,\" \"Holy Seed Baptist Synagogue\", \"Ancient Mystic Order of Melchizedek\", \"Ancient Order\", \"All Eyez on Egypt\", \"United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors\", \"Yamassee Native American Tribe\", \"Washitaw Tribe\", and \"Lodge 19 of the Ancient and Mystic Order of Malachizodok.\" While drawing from various religious and historical themes, Malachi York continued to focus on Nubia. He promoted a design featuring an ankh in the middle of a six-pointed star of Judaism and Islamic crescent, a symbol used by the Ansarullah Community. The ankh is associated with pre-Islamic Sudan, Nubia.\n\nDwight York changed his name legally in 1990 to \"Issa al Haadi al Mahdi\" when he was still living in Brooklyn. He changed it again in 1993 to \"Malachi York,\" but also adopted a number of titles and pseudonyms, including \"The Supreme Grand Master Dr. Malachi Z. York,\" \"Nayya Malachizodoq-El,\" and \"Chief Black Eagle.\"\n\nBy 1985 York had added miracle-performance to his repertoire. He claimed to materialize sacred, healing ash in front of his followers, much in the fashion of Sathya Sai Baba.\n\nIn 1988 York was convicted of obtaining a passport with a false birth certificate.\n\nYork left Brooklyn with an estimated 300 followers about 1990. Some settled in upstate New York. He later moved with numerous followers to Georgia. Others joined them from such cities as Baltimore, Philadelphia, Hartford, New York and Washington, D.C. According to former follower Robert J. Rohan, who later wrote a book about the movement, York moved in order to avoid criminal investigations and other charges in New York.\n\nPerhaps to avoid scrutiny from the international Muslim community, the Nation of Islam, the Nation of Gods and Earths, legal troubles, and the negative history of his group during their New York period, he changed his own name several times, as well as the group's name, and masked different parts of their doctrine. In Georgia, they changed their name to the \"United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors.\"\n\nAt York's direction, the community purchased land and built \"Tama-Re,\" an Egyptian-themed complex built on of land near Eatonton, Georgia. It was built over a period of years and completed in 1993.\n\nTensions with county authorities increased in 1998, when the county sought an injunction against construction and uses that violated zoning. At the same time, the Nuwaubian community increased its leafletting of Eatonton and surrounding areas, charging white officials with racial discrimination and striving to increase opposition to them. Threats mounted and an eviscerated dog carcass was left at the home of the county attorney.\n\nWithin Putnam County, the Nuwaubians lost black support, in part by trying to take over the NAACP chapter. But outside, they appealed to activists, claiming to be persecuted in the county. During this period, the group maintained Holy Tabernacle stores \"in more than a dozen cities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Trinidad.\" And York purchased a $557,000 mansion in Athens, Georgia, about 60 miles away, the base of the University of Georgia.\n\nIn July 1999, \"Time magazine\" reported on the \"40-ft. pyramids, obelisks, gods, goddesses and a giant sphinx,\" built by York's followers in rural Georgia in an article titled \"Space Invaders\".\n\nIn 2005 federal government officials acquired the property of Tama-Re through asset forfeiture after York was convicted and sentenced to prison for 135 years. He owed money for violating financial laws. After the property was sold, new owners demolished the buildings and monuments.\n\nBeginning in Brooklyn, York had established strict sexual practices within the community, reserving for himself sexual access to many women and girls, including wives and children of followers.\n\nTheodore Gabriel wrote about these practices:\n\n[W]hile extolling the virtues and importance of family life and the conjugal relationship, he [York] denies such relationships to his followers except at strictly controlled intervals. He urges his female followers to pattern themselves on the Islamic paradigms of the wife and the mother, apparently desiring the creation of stable family units. But in reality the husbands and wives are segregated in dormitories, separated also from their children. York permits spouses to cohabit only once every three months. They are permitted to meet in the \"Green Room\" by prior appointment only.\n\nAnonymous letters were sent to Putnam County officials alleging child molestation at the Nuwaubian community. The FBI, which had started investigating the group in 1993, assigned a major task force to it. In 2002 York was arrested and charged with more than 100 counts of sexually molesting dozens of children, some as young as four years old. According to Bill Osinski, who wrote a 2007 book about York and the case:\n\nWhen he [York] was finally indicted, state prosecutors literally had to cut back the number of counts listed — from well beyond a thousand to slightly more than 200 — because they feared a jury simply wouldn't believe the magnitude of York's evil.… [It] is believed to be the nation's largest child molestation prosecution ever directed at a single person, in terms of number of victims and number of alleged criminal acts.\n\nIn early 2003 York's lawyer had him evaluated by a forensic psychologist, who diagnosed a DSM-IV\n\nimpression consisting of Axis I – Clinical Syndrome of Delusional (Paranoid) Disorder, Generalized anxiety disorder, Adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and Axis II – personality disorders; histrionic personality traits, self-defeating personality traits, and schizotypal personality features.\n\nIn 2003, York entered into a plea bargain that was later dismissed by the judge. He was convicted by a jury on January 23, 2004. The judge rejected his plea to be returned for trial to his own \"tribe,\" after York claimed status as an indigenous person:\n\nYour Honor, with all due respects to your government, your nation, and your court, we the indigenous people of this land have our own rights, accepted sovereign, our own governments. We are a sovereign people, Yamassee, Native American Creeks, Seminole, Washitaw Mound Builders. And all I'm asking is that the Court recognize that I am an indigenous person. Your court does not have jurisdiction over me. I should be transferred to the Moors Cherokee Council Court in which I will get a trial by juries of my peers. I cannot get a fair trial, Your Honor, if I'm being tried by the settlers or the confederates. I have to be tried by Native Americans as a Native American. That's my inalienable rights, and it's on record.\n\nHe asserted to the court that he was a \"secured party,\" and answered questions in court with the response: \"I accept that for value.\" This may have been a heterodox legal strategy based on patriot mythology.\n\nEarly in 2004, York was convicted in federal court by a jury of multiple RICO, child molestation, and financial reporting charges. He was sentenced to 135 years in prison.\n\nHis case was appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the convictions on October 27, 2005. A U.S. Supreme Court appeal was denied in June 2006.\n\nYork's followers assert a number of defenses, including that their leader Malachi Z. York, who was charged and convicted, is not the same person as the Dwight D. York who is listed in court documents as the defendant. (One of York's sons is named Dwight, and sometimes the claim is made that it is York's son and not York who is or should be the real defendant). Other say that York was \"set up\" by his son Jacob in coordination with al Qaeda-linked American mosques jealous of York's influence among black Muslims.\n\nYork believes that his betrayal, arrest, trial and imprisonment (and eventual release) were foretold in chapter 10 of Zecharia Sitchin's \"The Wars of the Gods and the Men\", with York being represented by Mar-duq in that story.\n\n Dwight York is serving his sentence at the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility (ADX) in Florence, Colorado as Inmate # 17911-054. His projected release date is April 7, 2122.\n\nYork's followers have said that since 1999 York has been a Consul General of Monrovia, Liberia, under appointment from then-President Charles Taylor. They argue he should be given diplomatic immunity from prosecution and extradited as a \"persona non-grata\" to Liberia. Officials have not accepted this claim.\n\nYork has taught an ever-changing and multifaceted doctrine over the years, with influences and borrowings from many sources. It has included a baroque cosmology, unconventional theories about race and human origins, cryptozoological and extraterrestrial speculations, black nationalism, conspiracy theory, and religious practices invented or borrowed from many existing religions.\n\nYork has had a variety of stories about his ancestry and birth, including that he was born in Omdurman, Sudan. This has not been documented. His parents of record are Mary C. York (\"née\" Williams), now also known as Faatimah Maryam, and her husband David Piper York. York has claimed that his biological father was Al Haadi Abdur Rahman Al Mahdi, whom his mother ostensibly met while studying as a student in the Sudan. This is not supported by any documentary sources.\n\nYork claims that the name he was given at birth was \"Isa Al Haadi Al Mahdi\" and that he was not given the name \"York\" (without a first name) until a month later when he and his mother returned to Boston. David and Mary York had four other children together: David, Dale, Debra and Dennis. York has claimed, without documentation being found, that his father was descended from \"Ben\" York, an enslaved African American who took part in the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804-1806).\n\nHe claims a paternal Sudanese grandfather, As Sayyid Abdur Rahman Al Mahdi, making York a descendant of the Muslim leader Muhammad Ahmad. There is no documentation to support this.\n\nOn his mother's side, York described his maternal grandfather, Clarence Daniel \"Bobby\" Williams, as \"an Egyptian Moor named Salah Hailak Al Ghala, a merchant seaman from a little village called Beluwla, in Nubia of Ancient Egypt.\" Another genealogical tree shows Bobby Williams' father as unknown and his mother as \"Madam Decontee\" of the Bassa tribe of Liberia. These claims have not been documented.\n\nYork has been known by a multitude of aliases over the years, many of which he used simultaneously. They include the following:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He extensively studied the various ethnic groups of the region, including Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Bukharan Jews. He wrote numerous books on the history of Central Asia.\n\nEdward A. Allworth was born on December 1, 1920, the son of Edward Allworth (1895–1966) and Ethel Walker. (His father received the Medal of Honor for service in France during World War I.) He received his bachelor's degree from Oregon State University. He received a master's degree from the University of Chicago. In 1959, he received a Ph.D. from Columbia University.\n\n During World War II, Allworth served as a platoon leader, second lieutenant, and adjutant, in the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division of the US Army, in the Normandy Invasion and the division's battles thereafter through the Allied World War II victory in Northern Europe.\n\nAllworth taught a wide variety of courses on Central Asian studies at Columbia University. In 1984, he established the Department of Middle East Languages and Cultures to focus on the study of contemporary Central Asia. He published numerous books on the history of Central Asia. These include \"Uzbek Literary Politics\" (1964), \"Central Asian Publishing and the Rise of Nationalism\" (1965), \"Central Asia: A Century of Russian Rule\" (1967), \"The Nationality Question in Soviet Central Asia\" (1973), \"Nationality Group Survival in Multiethnic States\" (1977), \"The Modern Uzbeks: From the Fourteenth Century to the Present\" (1990), \"The Tatars of Crimea: Return to the Homeland\" (1998), and \"The Preoccupations of Abdalrauf Fitrat, Bukharan Nonconformist: An Analysis and List of His Writings\" (2000).\n\nAllworth was Emeritus Professor of Turko-Soviet Studies at Columbia University.

When the Central Asian countries gained independence in the early 1990s, while some students dropped out of the PhD track to follow the appeal of rapid lucrative employment in oil companies, governments and radio stations beaming propaganda to the region, he kept a handful of us at bay and steeped us in the writings of the early 20th century reformist writer Abdalrauf Fitrat, and the study of Chagatay, the 15th century pre-Uzbek language.

Born on 20 February 1861 in Lambeth, London, to Robert Jenks, upholsterer, and his wife Frances Sarah, née Jones, he was educated at Dulwich College (1874-77) and King's College, Cambridge, where he was scholar (1886) and, in 1889-95, fellow. He graduated B.A., LL.B. in 1886, and M.A. in 1890. He was awarded the Le Bas Prize and the Thirlwall Prize and was chancellor's medallist. In 1887 he was called to the Bar and for the next two years lectured at Pembroke and Jesus colleges, Cambridge.\n\nHe was a brilliant law student at King's College, Cambridge and was placed first in the law tripos of 1886. He was called to the bar in 1887.\n\nHe held many seats: Director of Studies in Law and History at Jesus College, Cambridge 1888-9, Dean at the faculty of law University of Melbourne 1890, University College, Liverpool 1890-92 then later to 1895 at Victoria University of Manchester, reader of English at University of Oxford from 1896, and then at the University of London from 1928-1930 as a professor of English law in the London School of Economics and Political Science, being succeeded by Sir David Hughes Parry.\n\nJenks was a Fellow of the British Academy. He was a founder of the Society of Public Teachers of Law and its secretary 1909-1917.\n\nHe married first in 1890 to Annie Ingham, who died after giving birth to a son; the son would die fighting in the Great War. His second marriage in 1898 was to Dorothy Maud, a daughter of Sir William Bower Forwood, with whom he had a daughter, and a son Jorian Jenks.\n\nJenks wrote a number of books and essays dealing with law, politics and history. He was the principal editor of \"A Digest of English Civil Law\" (1905–1917) which led to receipt of an honorary doctorate from Paris. After two further editions in his lifetime (1921 and 1938), the fourth edition (1947), edited in his place by P. H. Winfield, retained Jenks's \"Prolegomena\", with its opening remark that a digest uses the indicative mood rather than the imperative mood of a code, and differs from an encyclopaedia in that it aims at economy of words. In the preface to the first instalment of the 1905 -17 edition, Jenks mentioned that the work had resulted from a suggestion of the President of the Berlin Society for Comparative Jurisprudence and Political Economy for a statement of English law, intended by the Society as the first of its projected series of handbooks on the legal systems of modern civilized communities, it being the Society's intention to produce a series of works to be modelled after the pattern of the German Civil Code which came into force throughout the German Empire on 1 January 1900, but departing from the arrangement of the German Code as considered advisable. Jenks's \"Digest\" was published by Butterworths, who, from 1907, were also publishing \"Halsbury's Laws of England\" as a \"complete statement of the whole law of England\".\n\nEdward Jenks is most famous for his iconoclastic essay \"The Myth of Magna Carta\" published in the Independent Review in 1904. Jenks argued against Stubbs's proposition that Magna Carta was the first corporate act of the nation roused to the sense of its unity, when the people of the towns and villages ranged themselves on the side of the barons against the king for the first time since the Norman Conquest.\n\n\nEntry in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\n\n"}

The term is deliberately similar to the term intention, which has a long history of use in philosophy of mind, but was designed to have a broader scope. \"Ententional\" is an adjective that applies to the class of objects and phenomena that refer to or are in some other way \"about\" something not present. This wikipedia page is ententional because it refers to and is explicitly about an abstract concept which is not physically present in the page itself. Other paradigm examples of ententional objects are books, DNA strands, and tools. In contrast, rocks, stars, and electromagnetic radiation are not ententional.\n\nJeremy Sherman writes on ententionality, \"Deacon coins the term \"ententional,\" to encompass the entire range of phenomena that must be explained, everything from the first evolvable function, to human social processes, everything traditionally called intentional but also everything merely functional, fitting and therefore representing its environment with normative (good or bad fit) consequences.\" \n\n"}

He was \"professor emeritus\" of the History of Natural Science at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany and the founder and honorary director of the Institute of the History of the Arab Islamic Sciences there. He also created museums in Frankfurt and Istanbul with replicas of historical Arabic-Islamic scientific instruments, tools and maps. His best known publication is the 17-volume \"Geschichte des Arabischen Schrifttums\", a standard reference in the field.\n\nSezgin earned his PhD from Istanbul University under the German Orientalist Hellmut Ritter in 1950. His thesis titled \"Buhari’nin Kaynakları\" (The Sources of Al-Bukhari) argued that, contrary to the common belief among European orientalists, Al-Bukhari's edition of collected Hadiths was based on written sources dating back to the 7th century as well as oral history. He obtained a position at Istanbul University, but was dismissed in the wake of the 1960 coup. He moved to Germany in 1961 and started working as a visiting professor at the University of Frankfurt. He was appointed professor at the university in 1965. His research in Frankfurt focused on Islam's Golden Age of Science. In 1982, Sezgin established the Institute of the History of the Arab Islamic Sciences. Today the Institute houses the most comprehensive collection of texts on the history of Arabic-Islamic science in the world. In 1983 Sezgin also founded a unique museum within the institute, bringing together more than 800 replicas of historical scientific instruments, tools and maps, mostly belonging to the Golden Age of Islamic science. A very similar museum was opened in 2008 in Istanbul.\n\nIn 1968, Sezgin found four previously unknown books of Diophantus' \"Arithmetica\" at the shrine of Imam Rezā in the holy Islamic city of Mashad in northeastern Iran.\n\nFuat Sezgin is the author and editor of numerous publications. His 17-volume work \"Geschichte des Arabischen Schrifttums\" (1967-2000) is the cornerstone reference on the history of science and technology in the Islamic world. The 5-volume \"Natural Sciences of Islam\" documents the items in the Frankfurt museum. Since 1984 he has edited the \"Journal for the History of Arabic-Islamic Science\".\n\nSezgin has argued that Muslim seafarers had reached the Americas by 1420, citing as evidence the inscription on a map and the fact that the high longitudinal precision of early maps of the Americas would not have been attainable using Western navigational technology.\n\nSezgin received several awards, including the King Faisal International Prize of Islamic Studies in 1978 and Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. He is member of the Turkish Academy of Sciences, the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco and academies of Arabic Language in Cairo, Damascus and Baghdad.\n\nOn 24 September 2012, Melih Gökçek, Mayor of Municipality of Metropolitan Ankara, announced that a square in Ankara was named in honor of Fuat Sezgin. A relief of him created by artist Aslan Başpınar at the square was revealed the same day in the presence of Fuat Sezgin and his spouse Ursula by the mayor.\n\n"}

Created in 1993, it is a private non-profit cultural institution, dedicated primarily to the preservation and restoration of Spanish Historical Heritage. Additionally it promotes the development of the fine arts in general and painting and sculpture in particular including the exhibition of artworks, the dissemination and knowledge of the matter, the artistic exchange and the implementation of activities aimed to facilitate the access to information of those who are interested. Its main territorial scope is the Balearic Islands.\nThe headquarters of the foundation is the Sa Bassa Blanca Museum, whose main building was designed by the famous Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy (1900-1989) in 1978. This building was declared a Listed Building (Landmark) by the Heritage Commission of the Government of Mallorca in 2011. The foundation is known for its collection of Old Master Portraits of Children from the 16th century to the 19th century, also listed as Historical Heritage, which is shown to the public in an old water reservoir conditioned for this purpose.\n\nThe couple formed by Yannick Vu and Ben Jakober created the foundation in 1993, and counted from the beginning with the support of their friend, the banker and philanthropist Georges Coulon Karlweis(died 2012).\nYannick Vu, president of the foundation, a painter and sculptor, born in France (1942) is now British. With a Vietnamese father and a French mother she grew up in Vence and Saint-Paul-de-Vence in a family linked to the arts and music. Her father, Vu Cao Dam (1908-2000) was a renowned Vietnamese painter and sculptor. Yannick Vu met the painter Domenico Gnoli (1933-1970) in 1963 in Paris and that same year they traveled together to Mallorca, they married in 1965 in New York City. Gnoli died at the age of 36, having achieved international success. In 1972, Yannick Vu remarried the sculptor Ben Jakober secretary of the Fundación. Beginning in 1979 Yannick Vu regularly exhibited her paintings in Europe and the U.S. and in the eighties she started making sculpture.\nBen Jakober is the secretary of the Fundación. Born in Vienna in 1930, he has had ties to Mallorca since 1968. Self-taught, he began his career as a sculptor at forty, encouraged by Yannick Vu. He uses different techniques and materials such as polyurethane, metal, stone, marble, installation, video and fiber optics and has had international exhibitions in Paris, New York, Budapest, Madrid and Palma de Mallorca. He has participated in numerous biennials.\nSince 1992, Ben Jakober and Yannick Vu sign their work together, as if they were a single artist. Their works form part of various public and private collections around the world. You can find works signed by them in different parts of Mallorca, such as Alcudia, Pollensa, the university campus, the airport or in front of Palma's Cathedral.\nThe foundation's board includes: Vice President Anthonie Stal (chairman of the board of the Kröller-Muller Museum in Otterlo, the Netherlands); Sofia Carmen Barroso Fernandez Araoz (expert in art and museum relations) and Cristina López Mancisidor de Macaya (former president of the Red Cross in Spain, Sebastian Escarrer Jaume (Counsellor of Melia Hotels International) and Enrique Juncosa Cirer (Poet and curator).\nSa Bassa Blanca's main building, home to the foundation, has gone through different stages throughout its history. Originally, it was a typical Majorcan farm house, dedicated to agriculture and native livestock. During the Spanish Civil War and until the 70's, the edifice was a military base due to its strategic location on the Bay of Alcudia. In 1978 the property was acquired by a consortium of which Ben Jakober and Yannick Vu formed part. They commissioned the Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy (1900-1989) to draw up the plans, which made Sa Bassa Blanca the only building designed by him in Europe. The rooms of the new building, thought of as a \"ribat\", were organized around a central courtyard. The Hispano Moresque character of the building is well suited to the island of Mallorca, having seen many different civilizations over the years. In April 2011 the Hassan Fathy building was declared a Listed Building (Landmark) by the Heritage Commission of the Government of Mallorca.\n\nAfter the initial contribution by the founders and with the help of other benefactors, the foundation has assembled an important collection of works of art. The main collection is “Nins”, which began over 40 years ago with a painting by the Majorcan painter Joan Mestre i Bosch (1826-1893) \"Portrait of a girl with cherries\" and now consists of more than 150 Old Master portraits of children from the 16th to the 19th centuries from different European countries. Most of the works represent portraits of royalty or nobility in their childhood, although there are some bourgeois and provincial paintings. Part of this collection is on view in an old underground water reservoir that was transformed into an exhibition hall and equipped to house and preserve the paintings. The collection shows the evolution of costumes, jewelry, amulets, pets, and toys that were part of the everyday life of the young models. Some of the works were commissioned to be sent to European courts in view of a marriage, as part of a complex net of political alliances and families, designed to ensure the survival of the main royal and noble dynasties of Europe.\n\nThe foundation also has a program of travelling temporary international exhibitions. Selected works have been exhibited in prominent museums like the Museu d'Arte Brasileira, Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado in São Paulo in 2000; the Museu de Belles Arts de València in 2000; the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland in Bonn in the winter of 2003/2004; the Museum of Fine Arts of Corunna in 2004; the Frist Center for the Visual Arts in Nashville in the winter of 2004/2005; the State Historical Museum in Moscow in the winter of 2005/2006; the Columbus Museum of Art, the Huntsville Museum of Art, The Society of the Four Arts,Palm Beach, Florida and the Nassau County Museum of Art, Roslyn Harbor, New York in 2008/2009 and the KunsthalleKrems, Austria in 2011. In October 2012 fifty six pictures are being shown in the Pera Museum, Istanbul and in 2013 thirty five are going to the Casa del Cordón (Burgos) in Burgos, Spain.\nTexts have been written by prominent Spanish, French, Italian and Dutch arthistorians, many of which are included in international publications.\n\nThe main subject of the technical underground hall called SoKraTES revolves around the installation inspired by Einstein's formula which defines the relationship between space and time. The spectacular curtain of Swarovski crystals made with 10.000 crystals acts as a dramatic backdrop toa complete fossilized skeleton of a Siberian woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis), dated to the Riss-Wurm interglacial period of the Late Pleistocene. There are also works by Dolores Vita, José María Sicilia, Jannis Kounellis, Gerhard Merz and Miquel Barceló (Felanitx, 1957), author of the new chapel in Palma cathedral; some works by Ben Jakober and Yannick Vu and tribal masks from Nepal, Tibet, Africa and the Himalayas.\n\nThe foundation's library houses more than 7,000 specialized books on art, photography and architecture, catalogued using the MilleniumInnopac program, supplied by the University of the Balearic Islands and shared by the Network of Libraries of the Balearic Islands, which allows students of the Universitat de les Illes Balears (UIB) to view the list of catalogued books via the Internet. Students or teachers can visit the library in person to consult the books by appointment. The library includes several works of contemporary art, such as the library wheel \"Leer con Prisa” by Ben Jakober and Yannick Vu, six lithographs by Miquel Barceló and two portraits of the founders painted by their friend Mati Klarwein (1932-2002).\n\nThe foundation has a park with \"zoological\" sculptures. Located in the gardens that surround the museum, the sculptures by Ben Jakober and Yannick Vu are animal forms inspired by archaeological works currently preserved in museums around the world. The monumental sculptures are executed in granite. The largest work is \"Dog\", based on a terracotta of the Japanese Haniwa culture (4th and 5th centuries AD), in the Tokyo National Museum.\n\nDesigned by Yannick Vu, the rose garden has over a hundred varieties of fragrant old English roses. It is designed as a walled \"HortusConclusus\" or medieval garden and is combined with an experimental organic kitchen garden.\n\nThe foundation receives visits from people of many nationalities, attracted by its strategic location and its important collections. At present, its most important activity is the development of the educational program, focused on schools on the island of Mallorca, university interns and families with children.\nStudents of all ages have the opportunity to come and commence their knowledge of art through specialized visits. During the school year 2013/14 there were 3549 school visitors, while this year 2014/2015 we received 4470 students. The challenge, from the beginning, has been to provide different views on how to foment a first contact with art and encourage the curiosity of the youngest, in a playful yet didactic way. Educational visits to the Sa Bassa Blanca Museum are developed under the title \"Discovering the history of art and its hidden secrets.\" This activity takes place in the different exhibition halls and endeavors to open a window on art in the hope that this first experience becomes a positive drive for future interactions with art.\nBased on the historical context and the importance of symbolism in the exhibitions, this visit aims to transmit values of respect and admiration for the artistic legacy. It is intended that students learn to enjoy art, its mechanisms (approaching artistic techniques) and their different languages, as well as understand the notion of timelessness in human expression through art and history.\n"}

{"id": "1358460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1358460", "title": "Henry of Huntingdon", "text": "Henry of Huntingdon\n\nHenry of Huntingdon (; 1088 – AD 1157), the son of a canon in the diocese of Lincoln, was a 12th-century English historian, the author of a history of England, the \"Historia Anglorum\", \"the most important Anglo-Norman historian to emerge from the secular clergy\". He served as archdeacon of Huntingdon. The few details of Henry's life that are known originated from his own works and from a number of official records. He was brought up in the wealthy court of Robert Bloet of Lincoln, who became his patron.\n\nAt the request of Bloet's successor, Alexander of Lincoln, Henry began to write his \"Historia Anglorum\", first published around 1129, an account of the history of England from its beginnings up to the year 1154.\n\nHenry was born in about 1088 and died about 1157. He succeeded his father Nicholas as archdeacon Diocese of Lincoln in 1110. No personal correspondence or anecdotes survived him and it seemed that no one considered him important enough to have written a memorial. His biography depends upon a few notices scattered through his own work and in a few places where he left his name in the course of his official duties. The identity of his mother is unknown. His father Nicholas, the first archdeacon of Huntingdon, was a clerk in holy orders, who had enough influence with the Bishop of Lincoln to secure the succession of his title for his son, a substantial inheritance for a man who had not yet reached thirty. Nicholas was canon of Lincoln for over thirty years until his death in 1110.\n\nHenry was received as a little boy into the \"familia\" of Robert Bloet of Lincoln and grew up in luxury, living in the wealth and splendour of England's richest episcopal court. His upbringing gave him a positive outlook towards the world, but in later years he learned to feel a certain recoil distrust of \"contemptus mundi\", \"contempt for the world\", a feeling which encompasses much of his mature literary work. Bishop Bloet's successor, Alexander of Lincoln, became sensible of Henry's aptitude for business and employed him frequently for important affairs, though it remains clear that Henry owed his promotion to the patronage of Bishop Bloet. It was at Bishop Alexander's request that Henry began to write his \"Historia Anglorum\" ('The History of The English'). The formal Prologue of his History, which was addressed to Bishop Alexander, was written in a floridly dense high style that allowed him to parade himself, before retreating into dutiful obscurity behind the chroniclers he had used. It was written as an elaborate defence of the writing of history and to show off his degree of education.\n\nOver the years, Henry's contempt for the world grew and became the informing spirit of his literary work and spiritual life. During his travels, he began to notice that people were more worried about taking care of their belongings rather than themselves. This led him to write a long poem on \"De contemptu visibilum\".\n\nOverall, the little-known information about Henry is concrete and suggestive, hinting at a life lived just below the first ranks of property and talent in an age of personal reticence. He mentions Lanfranc as having been \"famous in our own time\", which places Henry's birthdate a few years before 1089, the year Lanfranc died. His \"Historia Anglorum\" leaves off in 1154, with the promise of another book for the new reign; however, since that book was never written it may be assumed that Henry died shortly afterward.\n\nHenry's most notable work is the \"Historia Anglorum\". He was bidden by Bishop Alexander of Lincoln to write a history of England from the earliest period and bringing it to modern times, ending it upon the accession of Henry II in 1154. It was assumed that the first edition was published at the end of 1129 and the second in 1135, at the end of the reign of Henry I of England. He published new editions as the years went on, the final fifth copy coming down in 1154, supposedly to terminate the History with the death of Stephen, leaving his history organised into eight books. There is some evidence that Henry did not intend to stop there, intending to add another book to his series that would cover the events of the first five years of the reign of Henry II. It was never carried out, as Henry of Huntingdon must have been at least seventy years old by the time of the king's accession and died shortly afterwards.\n\nHenry's ear for telling detail is responsible for entertaining touches drawn from current legend and his own fertile imagination. C. Warren Hollister notes the anecdote of King Canute's failure to stem the tide by command and Henry I's ignoring his physician's orders to dine on lampreys. Such touches rendered his history popular – there are twenty-five surviving manuscripts – and they embedded his anecdotes firmly into popular history.\n\n\"Historia Anglorum\" was first printed by Sir Henry Savile in 1596 in the historical miscellany \"Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores post Bedam praecipui\".\n\nHenry's sources included:\n\n\nAs an author, Henry distinguished himself in his youth by writing poetry, comprising eight books of epigrams, eight books on love, and the so-called \"Anglicanus ortus\", eight books on herbs, spices and gems united by a medical theme. Of these, two books of epigrams and the eight medical books survive, the latter identified only in modern times. The \"Anglicanus ortus\" has since been published, books 1–6 (on herbs and spices) as \"Anglicanus ortus: a Verse Herbal of the Twelfth Century\" (Toronto, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, c2012), and books 7–8 (on gems) as \"Henry of Huntingdon's lapidary rediscovered and his \"Anglicanus ortus\" reassembled\" (\"Mediaeval Studies\", v. 68, 2006, pp. 43–87), both edited by Winston Black. Henry wrote an Epistle to Henry I on the Succession of foreign kings and emperors up to their own time, and another to a man named Warin that contained an account of the ancient British kings from Brute to Cadwaller. The information for this account was obtained from a monk while Henry was at the Abbey of Bec, which held the writings of Geoffrey of Monmouth.\n\nHenry's most notable epistle was a funereal exercise addressed to his recently deceased friend and fellow archdeacon of Lincoln diocese, Walter of Leicester, titled \"De contemptu mundi\" (\"On Contempt for the world\"), which from internal evidence dates to 1135.\n\nThe contribution that Henry of Huntingdon brought to history cannot solely rest with his \"Historia Anglorum\" but must also include his Epistles. All of these writings offer an insight into the minds of those who lived in the twelfth century and illuminate how historians of the time recorded history and corresponded with their peers. Henry's legacy consisted of his own contribution to the history of England and his recorded thoughts and ideas, thereby opening a valuable perspective on his era's mindset.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14015", "title": "Herstory", "text": "Herstory\n\nHerstory is history written from a feminist perspective, emphasizing the role of women, or told from a woman's point of view. The principal aim of herstory is to bring women out of alleged obscurity from the historical record. It is a neologism coined as a pun with the word \"history\", as part of a feminist critique of conventional historiography, which in their opinion is traditionally written as \"his story\", i.e., from the masculine point of view. (The word \"history\"—from the Ancient Greek ἱστορία, or \"historia\", meaning \"knowledge obtained by inquiry\"—is etymologically unrelated to the possessive pronoun \"his\".) This movement has led to an increase in activity in other female-centric disciplines such as femistry and galgebra. \n\nThe herstory movement has spawned women-centered presses, such as Virago Press in 1973, which publishes fiction and non-fiction by noted women authors like Janet Frame and Sarah Dunant.\n\nRobin Morgan, in a book of her selected writings states that the debut of the word \"herstory\" was in the byline of her article \"Goodbye to All That\", in early 1970, in the first issue of the \"underground\" New Left newspaper \"Rat\" after it was overtaken by women to clean it of sexism. She writes that she identified herself as a member of W.I.T.C.H., decoding the acronym as \"Women Inspired to Commit Herstory\".\n\nIn 1976, Casey Miller and Kate Swift wrote in \"Words & Women,\"\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, second-wave feminists saw the study of history as a male-dominated intellectual enterprise and presented \"herstory\" as a means of compensation. The term, intended to be both serious and comic, became a rallying cry used on T-shirts and buttons as well as in academia.\n\nIn 2017, Hridith Sudev, an inventor, environmentalist and social activist associated with various youth movements, launched 'The Herstory Movement'; an online platform to \"celebrate lesser known great persons; female, queer or otherwise marginalized, who helped shape the modern World History\". It is intended as an academic platform to feature stories of female historic persons and thus help facilitate more widespread knowledge about 'Great Women' History.\n\nChristina Hoff Sommers has been a vocal critic of the concept of herstory, and presented her argument against the movement in her 1994 book, \"Who Stole Feminism?\". Sommers defined herstory as an attempt to infuse education with ideology, at the expense of knowledge. The \"gender feminists\", as she termed them, were the band of feminists responsible for the movement, which she felt amounted to negationism. She regarded most attempts to make historical studies more female-inclusive as being artificial in nature, and an impediment to progress.\n\nProfessor and author Devoney Looser has criticized the concept of herstory for overlooking the contributions that some women made as historians before the twentieth century.\n\nThe Global Language Monitor, a nonprofit group that analyzes and tracks trends in language, named \"herstory\" the third most \"politically incorrect\" word of 2006—rivaled only by \"macaca\" and \"\"Global Warming Denier\".\"\n\nBooks published on the topic include:\n\n"}
{"id": "4106535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4106535", "title": "Holy Terror (graphic novel)", "text": "Holy Terror (graphic novel)\n\nHoly Terror is 2011 a graphic novel by Frank Miller which follows a superhero named The Fixer as he battles Islamic terrorists after an attack on Empire City.\n\nThe novel was originally proposed as Holy Terror, Batman! in 2006 but is no longer a project associated with the Batman character or DC Comics. Miller explained in 2010 \"It's no longer a DC book. I decided partway through it that it was not a Batman story.\"\n\nAs originally announced the plot revolved around Batman defending Gotham City from an attack by the Islamist terrorist group Al-Qaeda. According to Miller, the comic would have been a \"piece of propaganda\" in which Batman \"kicks Al-Qaeda's ass.\"\n\nMiller announced the graphic novel during a panel at the WonderCon comic book convention held in San Francisco in 2006. He summarized the work as \"not to put too fine a point on it, a piece of propaganda... Superman punched out Hitler. So did Captain America. That's one of the things they're there for.\"\n\nThe title of the graphic novel is a reference to the War on Terror as well as the catchphrase (\"Holy [something], Batman!\") used by Burt Ward (Robin) in the 1960s \"Batman\" television series.\n\nLater that year, on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks, NPR aired a brief memorial commentary by Miller, which provided insight into his inspiration for this project:\n\nIn a May 2007 interview, Miller relayed that he was still at work on the graphic novel, which he said was \"bound to offend just about everybody\". Miller also said he was about 100 pages into it with 50 remaining. The following year Miller said the series, until then being billed as \"Holy War, Batman\", would no longer feature Batman. \"As I worked on it, it became something that was no longer Batman,\" he clarified. \"It's somewhere past that and I decided it's going to be part of a new series that I'm starting.\"\n\nIn 2010, Miller said he was no longer working on that project, clarifying that \"Holy Terror\" was in progress but without Batman. He later said it would feature a new character called The Fixer and not be published by DC. \"It's no longer a DC book,\" he explained. \"I decided partway through it that it was not a Batman story. The hero is much closer to Dirty Harry than Batman. It's a new hero that I've made up that fights Al Qaeda.\"\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con International 2011, Miller further explained the reason to drop Batman and use The Fixer as the protagonist, saying \"This character is much more well adjusted in committing terrible acts of violence on very evil people.\" Talking about the controversy the graphic novel might generate, he said he hoped the book accomplished its purpose in angering people.\n\"Holy Terror\" was controversial upon release; many comic book writers and reviewers argued that the novel's depiction of Muslims was Islamophobic. David Brothers of ComicsAlliance, in a review of the book, felt that Miller's writing \"[simplifies] matters to an almost absurd level... the enemy in \"Holy Terror\" is not so much the terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, but the religion of Islam.\" Similarly, Cyriaque Lamar of Io9 called the portrayal of terrorists \"cartoonish... [gutting] \"Holy Terror\" of any emotional resonance.\" Spencer Ackerman of \"Wired\" wrote that the book was \"one of the most appalling, offensive and vindictive comics of all time... Miller's \"Holy Terror\" is a screed against Islam, completely uninterested in any nuance or empathy toward 1.2 billion people he conflates with a few murderous conspiracy theorists.\"\n\nIn August 2006, fellow Batman writer Grant Morrison criticized the novel's concept, saying:\n\nMiller responded generally to these criticisms on his blog, again referring to the book as intentional propaganda \"without apology\" and saying, \"I'm too old to serve my country in any other way. Otherwise, I'd gladly be pulling the trigger myself.\" However, in 2018 Miller expressed regret for writing \"Holy Terror\": \"When I look at \"Holy Terror\", which I really don’t do all that often, I can really feel the anger ripple out of the pages... I don’t want to wipe out chapters of my own biography. But I’m not capable of that book again.\"\n\n"}

He should not be confused with a Cordoban \"faqih\" of the same name.\n\nIbn Gharsiya was born into a Christian Basque family, but was taken prisoner in his childhood and raised in the Islamic faith. He grew up proficient and eloquent in both Classical Arabic and the colloquial Andalusi Arabic dialect. Ibn Gharsiya was proud of his Basque origin and remained a lifelong fervent Muslim throughout his lifetime. His surname \"al-Bashkunsi\" is the Arabic word for Basque, and therefore, signified his Basque heritage. He served under the Slavic \"Emir\" of Denia, Mujāhid al-‘Āmirī, and his son, Ali ibn Mujahid. Like Ibn Gharsiya, the ruling family of Denia were also Muladi and had broken free from the Caliphate of Cordoba after the turbulent year of 1009. Like other \"taifas\", his kingdom had sought to distance itself from the Umayyad period. Ibn Gharsiya subsequently spent most of his life as a \"katib\" at the court of Denia.\n\nIbn Gharsiya was a leading proponent and advocate of the \"Shu'ubiyya\" thought in Al-Andalus. The \"Shu'ubiyya\" movement demanded equality of power, wealth and status of the Non-Arab Berbers and Muwalladun by Arabs. In common with the Arabs, they were very active in promoting the Arab-Islamic culture and language and claimed cultural integration with the Arab ethnic groups—as had been achieved by the non-Arab Semitic peoples of the Middle East.\n\nBetween 1051 and 1056, Ibn Gharsiya wrote a \"risala\" against the Arab ascendancy in al-Andalus, which concurrently praises non-Arab Islam. Opponents of this work have called it violent, insulting, and bitter in its attack on the Arabs and, contrary to prevailing tradition, it criticises Arab Muslims as inferior in rank and lineage. Simultaneously, it glorifies non-Arab Muslims, such as the Berbers, and also those converts from the Visigoths, Slavs, and Romans.\n\nIn the \"risala\", Ibn Gharsiya asserts cultural superiority of the Muwalladun over the Arabs by diminishing and belittling Arab culture. While he boasts about the Muladi mastery of natural philosophy, exact logic, astronomy, music, arithmetic, and geometry, he ridicules Arabs as \"experts in the description of towering camels.\" He also tries to show that non-Arab rule in Denia was much better than those of the other \"taifas\". By doing so, he attempted to formulate and legitimise a non-Arab alternative to Arab rule which involved combining Arab and non-Arab traditions, which were mainly Persian and Byzantine. This gave him an opportunity to debate with the Arab Islamic scholar Abu Jaʻfar Ahmad ibn al-Jazzar, who had been present at the court of Ibn Sumadih, \"Emir\" of Almeria. However, according to the Escorial manuscript, the letter was addressed to a certain Abu ʻAbd Allah Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn al-Haddad al-Qaisi. However, despite this difference, it is clear that the addressee was linked to the court of Ibn Sumadih and to the \"taifa\" state of Almeria.\n\nIbn Gharsiya's epistle addresses some of the most fundamental and important questions in the Muslim community of al-Andalus at the time, such as the relationship between the Arabs and Berbers of the Islamic faith with the Muwalladun, who were the descendants of the indigenous Iberian converts to Islam. Ibn Gharsiya stressed that a sound interpretation of Islam should also be of value to the non-Arab Muslims. This epistle represents the adoption of the Eastern \"Shuʻubi\" ideology by many indigenous Andalusian Muslims, which argued against Arab exclusivity, as expressed in their treatises comparing the Arabs unfavourably with the Persians and the Byzantines.\n\nIbn Gharsiya's \"risala\" was written in Arabic courtly prose; thus it did not represent a rejection of Arabic literary culture, but only of Arab lineage. According to the \"Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature\", this \"risala\" was of minor importance, and its few exponents tended to repeat clichés adopted from the earlier Islamic East. The \"risala\" elicited at least seven refutations, only five of which actually survive. Like the original, the refutations seem to have been written in imitation of eastern models. Only one of the refutations was specifically directed against Ibn Gharsiya. American scholar James T. Monroe states that the fact of Ibn Gharsiya's \"risala\" against the Arabs going unpunished, indicates that the cause of Arabism as a meaningful social force had ceased to have any political significance.\n\nGöran Larsson, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, points out that in spite of his extensive use of Persian traditions in his \"risala\", Ibn Gharsiya was not promoting a specifically Persian sovereign, merely a non-Arab model of rule. To this, Monroe adds:\nBesides the epistle, the only words from Ibn Gharsiya that has been preserved are some lines by the 12th century Andalusian geographer, historian and writer, Ibn Said al-Maghribi. These lines are believed to have been composed in praise of Ibn Gharsiya's lord, Ali ibn Mujahid. In praise of Ibn Gharsiya, Ibn Said states:\n\n"}
{"id": "56451041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56451041", "title": "Janamejaya", "text": "Janamejaya\n\nJanamejaya () was a Kuru king who reigned during the Middle Vedic period (12th-9th centuries BCE). Along with his father and predecessor Parikshit, he played a decisive role in the consolidation of the Kuru state, the arrangement of Vedic hymns into collections, and the development of the orthodox srauta ritual, transforming the Kuru realm into the dominant political and cultural center of northern India. He also appears as a figure in later legends and traditions, the Mahabharata and the Puranas.\n\nJanamejaya is mentioned as a great king and conqueror in a number of late Vedic texts. The \"Aitareya Brahmana\" (VIII.21) states that his priest Tura Kāvasheya anointed him with the Aindra Mahabhisheka (great anointing of Indra). The \"Shatapatha Brahmana\" mentions that he performed an \"ashvamedha\" (horse sacrifice), for getting himself rid of the \"Brahmahatya\" (sin associated with killing of a Brahmin), and the priest who performed it for him was Indrota Daivapa Shaunaka at a place named Āsandīvat.\n\nH.C. Raychaudhuri dates Parikshit, his father, in ninth century BC. Michael Witzel dates the Pārikṣita Dynasty of the Kuru Kingdom to the 12th-11th centuries BC.\n\nOnly one Janamejaya is mentioned in Vedic literature; however, post-Vedic literature (Mahabharata and Puranas) seems to indicate the existence of two kings by this name, one who lived before the Kurukshetra War was an ancestor to the Pandavas, and one who lived later and was a descendant. Historian H. C. Raychaudhuri believes that the second Janamejaya's description better corresponds to the Vedic king, whereas the information available about first is scanty and inconsistent, but Raychaudhuri questions whether there were actually two distinct kings. He suggests that there \"is an intrusion into the genealogical texts\" of the late, post-Vedic tradition, which also has two of Janamejaya's father Parikshit, possibly \"invented by genealogists to account for anachronisms\" in the later parts of the Mahabharata, as \"a bardic duplication of the same original individual regarding whose exact place in the Kuru genealogy no unanimous tradition had survived.\"\n\nFour copper-plate grant inscriptions purportedly issued during Janamejaya's reign were discovered in the 20th century, but were proved to be fake by historians.\n\nHe was the son of King Parikshit and Queen Madravati according to the Mahabharata (I.95.85), but according to the Bhagavata Purana (I.xvi.2), his mother was Iravati, daughter of Uttara. He was the grandson of Abhimanyu and the great-grandson of Arjuna, the valiant warrior hero of the Mahābhārata. He ascended to the Kuru throne following the death of his father. His significance comes as the listener of the first narration of the Mahābhārata, narrated by Vaishampayana, pupil of Vyasa. According to the Vayu Purana and the Matsya Purana, there was a dispute between him and Vaishampayana. Possibly, as its aftermath, he abdicated and his son Shatanika succeeded him. According to the Puranas,\n\nIn Mahabharata, Janmejaya was mentioned as having six able brothers viz, Kakshasena, Ugrasena, Chitrasena, Indrasena, Sushena and Nakhaysena. The initial chapters of the epic narrates various aspects of his life including his conquest of Takshasila and about his encounter with Naga Takshaka. He wanted to exterminate the race of Nagas, since Takshaka was responsible for the death of his father Parikshit.\n\nEmperor Janmejay was responsible for the retelling of the famous epic \"Mahābhārata\", a story of Janmejay's ancestors from the time of Bharata up to the great Kurukshetra war between his great-grandfathers the Pandavas and their paternal cousins the Kauravas. The Mahabharata states that it was recited to Janmejay at the \"sarpa satra\" (snake sacrifice) by the sage Vaishampayana to whom it had been imparted by his perceptor Vedavyasa, after he asked Vaishampayana about his ancestors.\n\nEmperor Janmejay ascended to the throne of Hastinapura upon the death of his father Parikshit. According to legend, Parikshit, the lone descendant of the House of Pandu, had died of snakebite. He had been cursed by a sage to die so, the curse having been consummated by the serpent-chieftain Takshak.\nJanmejay bore a deep grudge against the serpents for this act, and thus decided to wipe them out altogether. He attempted this by performing a great \"Sarpa satra\" – a sacrifice that would destroy all living serpents.\nAt that time, a learned sage named Astika, a boy in age, came and interfered. His mother Manasa was a Naga and his father a Brahmin. Janmejay had to listen to the words of the learned Astika and set the then-imprisoned Takshaka free. He also stopped the massacre of the Nagas and ended all enmity with them (1,56). From that time onward, the Nagas and Kurus lived in peace.\nThe mass sacrifice was started on the banks of the river Arind at Bardan, now Known as Parham, a corrupt form of Parikshitgarh. A masonry tank (reservoir) said to have been built by Emperor Janmejay to mark the site of the sacrificial pit, known as \"Parikshit kund\", still exists in Mainpuri district. This is known as Gowdvana. Close to this village a very large and high khera containing the ruins of a fort and some stone sculptures has been found. It is said to date back to the time of Emperor Parikshit. A popular local legend is that as a consequence of the virtues of that sacrifice snakes are still harmless in this place and its neighborhood.\n\nAccording to \"Puranas\", Janamejaya was succeeded by his grandson Ashwamedatta Further in the lineage, are mentioned, Adhisima-krishna and Nichakshu. After the time of his successors, the dynasty came to an end.\n\n"}

One of his captains was named Alonzo Pinzón, who left Cousin in a dispute after their return to Dieppe, and who is claimed to have left for Spain from where he advised Columbus on his westward sail. Pinzon is known to have displayed a remarkable confidence in guiding Columbus in his discovery of the New World. No indisputable written records remain however to support Cousin's claim to discovery.\n\nCousin's travel was succeeded by that of Binot Paulmier de Gonneville in 1504 onboard \"L'Espoir\", which was properly recorded and brought back an Indian named Essomericq. Gonneville affirmed that when he visited Brazil, French traders from Saint-Malo and Dieppe had already been trading there for several years.\n\nThe precedent of Jean Cousin and his Normand sailors was used by Charles IX to justify the French attempts at colonizing Florida at Fort Caroline in 1564-65, as, it was said, they had discovered the New World before the Spanish did. The area was called \"Terre des Bretons\" by the French. \n\nThe claim of Jean Cousin's discovery of the New World has long been reaffirmed in France. In 1660, Estienne Cleirac in \"Us et coustumes de la mer\" emphasized it. The claim is also sometimes reaffirmed in contemporary popular literature.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25767401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25767401", "title": "Joseph Fourier", "text": "Joseph Fourier\n\nJean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (; ; 21 March 1768 – 16 May 1830) was a French mathematician and physicist born in Auxerre and best known for initiating the investigation of Fourier series and their applications to problems of heat transfer and vibrations. The Fourier transform and Fourier's law are also named in his honour. Fourier is also generally credited with the discovery of the greenhouse effect.\n\nFourier was born at Auxerre (now in the Yonne département of France), the son of a tailor. He was orphaned at the age of nine. Fourier was recommended to the Bishop of Auxerre and, through this introduction, he was educated by the Benedictine Order of the Convent of St. Mark. The commissions in the scientific corps of the army were reserved for those of good birth, and being thus ineligible, he accepted a military lectureship on mathematics. He took a prominent part in his own district in promoting the French Revolution, serving on the local Revolutionary Committee. He was imprisoned briefly during the Terror but, in 1795, was appointed to the \"École Normale\" and subsequently succeeded Joseph-Louis Lagrange at the \"École Polytechnique\".\n\nFourier accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on his Egyptian expedition in 1798, as scientific adviser, and was appointed secretary of the Institut d'Égypte. Cut off from France by the British fleet, he organized the workshops on which the French army had to rely for their munitions of war. He also contributed several mathematical papers to the Egyptian Institute (also called the Cairo Institute) which Napoleon founded at Cairo, with a view of weakening British influence in the East. After the British victories and the capitulation of the French under General Menou in 1801, Fourier returned to France.\n\nIn 1801, Napoleon appointed Fourier Prefect (Governor) of the Department of Isère in Grenoble, where he oversaw road construction and other projects. However, Fourier had previously returned home from the Napoleon expedition to Egypt to resume his academic post as professor at École Polytechnique when Napoleon decided otherwise in his remark\n\nHence being faithful to Napoleon, he took the office of Prefect. It was while at Grenoble that he began to experiment on the propagation of heat. He presented his paper \"On the Propagation of Heat in Solid Bodies\" to the Paris Institute on December 21, 1807. He also contributed to the monumental \"Description de l'Égypte\".\n\nIn 1822, Fourier succeeded Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre as Permanent Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences. In 1830, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn 1830, his diminished health began to take its toll:\n\nShortly after this event, he died in his bed on 16 May 1830.\n\nFourier was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, a tomb decorated with an Egyptian motif to reflect his position as secretary of the Cairo Institute, and his collation of \"Description de l'Égypte\". His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\n\nA bronze statue was erected in Auxerre in 1849, but it was melted down for armaments during World War II. Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble is named after him.\n\nIn 1822 Fourier published his work on heat flow in \"Théorie analytique de la chaleur\" (\"The Analytical Theory of Heat\"), in which he based his reasoning on Newton's law of cooling, namely, that the flow of heat between two adjacent molecules is proportional to the extremely small difference of their temperatures. This book was translated, with editorial 'corrections', into English 56 years later by Freeman (1878). The book was also edited, with many editorial corrections, by Darboux and republished in French in 1888.\n\nThere were three important contributions in this work, one purely mathematical, two essentially physical. In mathematics, Fourier claimed that any function of a variable, whether continuous or discontinuous, can be expanded in a series of sines of multiples of the variable. Though this result is not correct without additional conditions, Fourier's observation that some discontinuous functions are the sum of infinite series was a breakthrough. The question of determining when a Fourier series converges has been fundamental for centuries. Joseph-Louis Lagrange had given particular cases of this (false) theorem, and had implied that the method was general, but he had not pursued the subject. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet was the first to give a satisfactory demonstration of it with some restrictive conditions. This work provides the foundation for what is today known as the Fourier transform.\n\nOne important physical contribution in the book was the concept of dimensional homogeneity in equations; i.e. an equation can be formally correct only if the dimensions match on either side of the equality; Fourier made important contributions to dimensional analysis. The other physical contribution was Fourier's proposal of his partial differential equation for conductive diffusion of heat. This equation is now taught to every student of mathematical physics.\n\nFourier left an unfinished work on determining and locating real roots of polynomials, which was edited by Claude-Louis Navier and published in 1831. This work contains much original matter—in particular, Fourier's theorem on polynomial real roots, published in 1820. François Budan, in 1807 and 1811, had published independently his theorem (also known by the name of Fourier), which is very close to Fourier's theorem (each theorem is a corollary of the other). Fourier's proof is the one that was usually given, during 19th century, in textbooks on the theory of equations. A complete solution of the problem was given in 1829 by Jacques Charles François Sturm.\n\nIn the 1820s Fourier calculated that an object the size of the Earth, and at its distance from the Sun, should be considerably colder than the planet actually is if warmed by only the effects of incoming solar radiation. He examined various possible sources of the additional observed heat in articles published in 1824 and 1827. While he ultimately suggested that interstellar radiation might be responsible for a large portion of the additional warmth, Fourier's consideration of the possibility that the Earth's atmosphere might act as an insulator of some kind is widely recognized as the first proposal of what is now known as the greenhouse effect, although Fourier never called it that.\n\nIn his articles, Fourier referred to an experiment by de Saussure, who lined a vase with blackened cork. Into the cork, he inserted several panes of transparent glass, separated by intervals of air. Midday sunlight was allowed to enter at the top of the vase through the glass panes. The temperature became more elevated in the more interior compartments of this device. Fourier concluded that gases in the atmosphere could form a stable barrier like the glass panes. This conclusion may have contributed to the later use of the metaphor of the 'greenhouse effect' to refer to the processes that determine atmospheric temperatures. Fourier noted that the actual mechanisms that determine the temperatures of the atmosphere included convection, which was not present in de Saussure's experimental device.\n\n\n\n"}

The missionaries hoped to establish gardens, keep livestock and open a school to attract and convert to Christianity and 'civilise' the local aboriginal people on their 640-acre grant of land.\n\nDifficulties were experienced in attracting Wemba-Wemba people to the mission - no converts were ever made - and there were also issues with a dispute over a fence and the area given to the missionaries, hostility from local landholders, problems with local authorities, and with gold diggers traversing the property. The mission closed on 1 July 1856.

{"id": "132857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=132857", "title": "Lionel Groulx", "text": "Lionel Groulx\n\nLionel Groulx (; 13 January 1878 – 23 May 1967) was a French Canadian Roman Catholic priest, historian and Quebec nationalist.\n\nLionel Groulx, né Joseph Adolphe Lyonel Groulx, the son of a farmer and lumberjack, and direct descendent of New France pioneer Jean Grou, was born and died at Vaudreuil, Quebec. After his seminary training and studies in Europe, he taught at Valleyfield College in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, and then the Université de Montréal. In 1917 he co-founded a monthly journal called \"Action Française\", becoming its editor in 1920.\n\nGroulx was one of the first Quebec historians to study Confederation: he insisted on its recognition of Quebec rights and minority rights, although he believed a combination of corrupt political parties and French Canadian minority status in the Dominion had failed to deliver on those promises, as the Manitoba conflict exposed. Groulx believed that only through national education and the Quebec government could the economic and social inferiority of French Canadians be repaired. Groulx was quite successful promoting his brand of ultramontanism.\n\nHis main focus was to restore Quebeckers' pride in their identity by knowledge of history, both the heroic acts of New France and the French Canadian and self-government rights obtained through a succession of important political victories: 1774, the Quebec Act recognized the rights of the Quebec province and its people with respect to French law, Catholic religion and the French language; in 1848, responsible government was finally obtained after decades of struggle, along with the rights of the French language; in 1867, the autonomy of the province of Quebec was restored as Lower Canada was an essential partner in the creation of a new Dominion through Confederation [La Confederation canadienne, Montreal, Quebec 10/10, 1978 (1918)]. \nLionel Groulx called the Canadian Confederation of 1867 a failure and espoused the theory that French Canada's only hope for survival was to bolster a French State and a Roman Catholic Quebec as the means to emancipate the nation and a bulwark against English power. He believed the powers of the provincial government of Quebec could and should be used, within Confederation, to better the lot of the French Canadian nation, economically, socially, culturally and linguistically. \nHis curriculum and writings de-emphasized or ignored conflicts between the clergy and those who were struggling for democratic rights, and de-emphasized any conflicts between the \"habitants\" or peasant class and the French-Canadian elites. He preferred the settled habitants to the more adventurous and, in his view, licentious coureurs de bois.\n\nIn 1928, the Université de Montréal insisted that Groulx sign a paper saying that he would respect Confederation and English-Canadian sensibilities as a condition of receiving a respectable salary for his teaching work. He would not sign, but finally agreed to a condition that he would limit himself to historical studies; he resigned from the editorship of \"L'action canadienne-française\" soon after, and the magazine ceased publication at the end of the year.\n\nLionel Groulx's major writings include \"L'Appel de la race\" (1922), \"Histoire de la Confédération\", \"Notre grande aventure\", \"Histoire du Canada français\" (1951), and \"Notre maître le passé\".\n\nIn order to inculcate such pride in a nation he considered degraded by Conquest, he engaged in national myth-making, celebrating the days of New France as a golden age and elevating Dollard des Ormeaux into a legendary hero. He has been described as the first French Canadian historian to consider the period of the French regime superior to that of the English rule that followed it, evaluating the Conquest as a disaster rather than the common nineteenth century view of it as a blessing that saved Quebec from the atheist terror of the French Revolution.\n\nHe also developed a Quebec history curriculum that emphasized the heroism of New France, the challenge British Conquest posed to the survival of the \"Canadiens\", and how this challenge was met by lengthy political struggles for democratic rights. He particularly insisted, as had many before him, on the Quebec Act of 1774 as the official recognition of his nation's rights. He bore particular affection for the undertaking of Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, that in 1849 successfully restored the rights of the French language along with the obtention of responsible government, thus thwarting the assimilation plans of Lord Durham's policy of forced Union between Upper and Lower Canada. (See Lord Elgin)\n\nAt the Ligue d'Action française, Groulx and his colleagues hoped to inspire revival of the French language and French Canadian culture, but also to create a think tank and public space of reflection, so that the French Canadian nation's elites would find ways to remedy French Canada's underdevelopment and exclusion from big business.\n\nSome collaborators of the review thus actively participated in the development of the HEC business school. Others were actively involved in the promotion of the Church's Social doctrine, an official Catholic answer to socio-economic distress that was meant to prevent the appeal of socialism and improve capitalism.\n\nGroulx's conservative Catholicism was not very appreciative of other religions, although he also acknowledged that racism was not Christian, and he maintained that Quebec should aspire to be a model society by Christian standards, including intense missionary action. [Le Canada français missionnaire, Montreal, Fides, 1962].\n\nThis Catholic social doctrine later became part of the 1930s Action liberale nationale (ALN) party, a new party that intellectuals close to Groulx and the defunct Action française appreciated. When Maurice Duplessis's victory became apparent, some instead accepted to cooperate with his government and its reforms. But Groulx, and with him a large number of intellectuals, chose to oppose him.\n\nDuring the Second World War Groulx, like many Canadien nationalists, spoke in favour of the Vichy regime of Philippe Pétain, although public statements to this effect remained rare.\n\nGroulx and other intellectuals settled into a partial alliance with Liberal Party of Quebec leader Adelard Godbout, who served as Premier from 1939 to 1944. They soon broke with him on account of his submission to the federal Liberals. Yet in 1944 they opposed Duplessis again, this time placing their hopes in another new party, the Bloc populaire Canadien, led by André Laurendeau. Future Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau was part of this young party, which soon suffered the same fate as the previous third party, the ALN. After the 1948 election, the Bloc populaire Canadien disappeared.\n\nGroulx was later remembered both for his strong case in favour of economic reconquest of Quebec by French Canadians, defense of the French language, and pioneer work as the first chair of Canadian history in Quebec (Universite de Montreal; see Ronald Rudin, Making History in Twentieth Century Quebec, Toronto University Press, 1997). Rudin underscores Groulx's founding role in scholarly History with the development of the Montréal History Department. Groulx founded the \"Institut d'histoire d'Amérique française\" in 1946, an institute located in Montreal devoted to the historical study of Quebec and of the French presence in the Americas and the publication of \"La revue d'histoire de l'Amérique française\", still today arguably the main publication for professional historians in Quebec. His main intellectual contribution was to create a rapprochement between nationalism and the Catholic religion, blunting the hostility between them that had existed in the nineteenth century.\n\nThrough his writings and teaching at the university and his association with the intellectual elite of Quebec, he had a profound influence on many people (such as Michel Chartrand and Camille Laurin). However, many of the young intellectuals he influenced often did not share his conservative ideology (such as his successor at the University of Montreal). Groulx's traditionalist, religious form of Québécois nationalism, known as clerico-nationalism, influenced Quebec society into the 1950s.\n\nCollège Lionel-Groulx, Lionel Groulx Avenue and the Lionel Groulx metro station are named in his honour.\n\nThere are charges of antisemitism made by Mordecai Richler and Esther Delisle against several pre-World War II Quebec intellectuals, including Groulx. However, Groulx expressed some opposition to antisemitism: \"L'antisémitisme, non seulement n'est pas une solution chrétienne; c'est une solution négative et niaise.\" (\"Not only is antisemitism not a Christian solution; it is a negative and silly solution.\")\n\n\n\n"}

It is widely accepted that she fought there as a conquistador, and there is also some evidence that she had previously spent several years as a castaway among the native inhabitants of pre-colonial Cuba.\n\nMaría Estrada (the surname is given as Destrada or Estrada in some sources) was born in Seville, although her father came originally from northern Spain. Her brother, the conquistador, Francisco de Estrada, had accompanied Christopher Columbus as a cabin boy, and when he returned to the New World to settle permanently in 1509, Maria probably travelled with him.\n\nAccording to a widely accepted identification, María joined an early expedition to the Gulf of Darién, perhaps accompanying her brother or an unrecorded husband. Their attempt to establish a settlement was a failure, and on the return journey to Santo Domingo, her vessel was shipwrecked on the island of Cuba.\n\nAt first, the locals treated the marooned Spanish crew well, helping them to travel along the coast; but at the place later known as Matanzas, the castaways were betrayed and massacred. The woman identified as Maria de Estrada was one of a handful of survivors, taken captive by one of the local chiefs who had led the attack.\n\nFor several years, she lived among the natives, one of the first Europeans to become acculturated to indigenous life in the Americas. In 1513, she was released thanks to the arrival of conquistadors on the island. Soon afterwards, she married one of these Spanish colonists, named Pedro Sánchez Farfán.\n\nIn 1519, Pedro Sánchez Farfán joined the expedition of Hernán Cortés, and fought in the initial Spanish conquest of Mexico, but it is not clear whether his wife went with him. Some modern sources indicate that María de Estrada only arrived on the mainland in April 1520, with the rival expedition of Pánfilo de Narváez, which included her brother Francisco, and which joined forces with Cortés at the end of May 1520.\n\nMaría was certainly with the combined army after it returned to the native capital at Tenochtitlan in June 1520: according to Bernal Díaz del Castillo, she was the only Spanish woman with them at this point. There had been the bloody unrest in Cortés' absence, and now the conquistadors were struck by a full-scale native revolt known as the \"Noche Triste\": after a week of street battles, the army was forced to fight its way back out of the city, suffering heavy casualties and losing most of its baggage and artillery.\n\nMost of the early sources refer to María de Estrada in general terms among the small number of women who accompanied the army at this time, but two writers of the later sixteenth century single her out as a soldier. The Tlaxcallan chronicler Diego Muñoz Camargo wrote that she fought her way out of the city as a rodelero during the battle, proving herself \"as good a warrior as any man\", and that she participated in the decisive charge of armored cavalry at the Battle of Otumba. The Dominican historian Diego Durán claims that she subsequently led a force of conquistadors into the area around Popocatépetl, where, she defeated the Nahua Indians of Hueyapan, charging head first and screaming \"Santiago!\" \n\nCortés certainly gave María and her husband an extensive \"encomienda\" in this area, based at Tetela del Volcán, with subsidiary units at Nepopozalco and at Hueyapan itself, while Sanchéz Farfán also gained additional estates further to the west. When she was widowed in the 1530s, María de Estrada assumed direct control of the estate, and in this capacity, she filed a petition to the king of Spain to ask for lighter taxation of her lands. Eventually, María de Estrada remarried to Alonso Martín, a civilian settler in Puebla, but by 1561, his relatives were fighting over the inheritance: instead, the \"encomienda\" was annexed to the royal domains of the king of Spain - it seems that neither María nor her first husband had surviving descendants.\n\nThe basic fact that María de Estrada accompanied Cortés' army to Mexico is vouched for by eyewitness memoirs, but historians do not agree about the reliability of the evidence on which her detailed biography is based.\n\nLuisa Campuzano, in the fullest discussion of the problem, concluded that the sources support each other, and provide a consistent factual and psychological portrait, but other historians have been more cautious, suggesting that María de Estrada's military prowess may be a literary fiction, and inferring that she arrived in the New World too late to be the castaway rescued in 1513. A later date for her arrival in the Americas would imply that María de Estrada was Sanchéz Farfán's second wife, a different woman from the castaway he had married in Cuba, although the sources providing these dates seem to be unaware of his earlier marriage.\n\nAdding to the problems, historians have sometimes muddled María de Estrada with other women associated with the conquistadors in Mexico: she has been confused with Marina de la Caballería, the wife of the prominent settler Alonso de Estrada., who in turn has been misidentified with the native princess Doña Marina,\n"}

{"id": "1017748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1017748", "title": "Moral agency", "text": "Moral agency\n\nMoral agency is an individual's ability to make moral judgments based on some notion of right and wrong and to be held accountable for these actions. A moral agent is \"a being who is capable of acting with reference to right and wrong.\"\n\nMost philosophers suggest only rational beings, who can reason and form self-interested judgments, are capable of being moral agents. Some suggest those with limited rationality (for example, people who are mildly mentally disabled or infants) also have some basic moral capabilities.\n\nDeterminists argue all of our actions are the product of antecedent causes, and some believe this is incompatible with free will and thus claim that we have no real control over our actions. Immanuel Kant argued that whether or not our real self, the noumenal self, can choose, we have no choice but to believe that we choose freely when we make a choice. This does not mean that we can \"control\" the effects of our actions.\nSome Indeterminists would argue we have no free will either. If, with respect to human behaviour, a so-called 'cause' results in an indeterminate number of possible, so-called 'effects', that does not mean the person had the free-thinking independent will to choose that 'effect'. More likely, it was the indeterminate consequence of his chance genetics, chance experiences and chance circumstances relevant at the time of the 'cause'.\n\nIn Kant's philosophy, this calls for an act of faith, the faith free agent is based on something \"a priori\", yet to be known, or immaterial. Otherwise, without free agent's \"a priori\" fundamental source, socially essential concepts created from human mind, such as justice, would be undermined (responsibility implies freedom of choice) and, in short, civilization and human values would crumble.\n\nIt is useful to compare the idea of moral agency with the legal doctrine of \"mens rea\", which means guilty mind, and states that a person is legally responsible for what he does as long as he \"should\" know what he is doing, and his choices are deliberate. Some theorists discard any attempts to evaluate mental states and, instead, adopt the doctrine of \"strict liability\", whereby one is liable under the law without regard to capacity, and that the only thing is to determine the degree of punishment, if any. Moral determinists would most likely adopt a similar point of view.\n\nPsychologist Albert Bandura has observed that moral agents engage in selective moral disengagement in regards to their own inhumane conduct.\n\nMany philosophers, such as Kant, view morality as a transaction among rational parties, i.e., among moral agents. For this reason, they would exclude other animals from moral consideration. Others, such as Utilitarian philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and Peter Singer have argued the key to inclusion in the moral community is not rationality — for if it were, we might have to exclude some disabled people and infants, and might also have to distinguish between the degrees of rationality of healthy adults — but the real object of moral action is the avoidance of suffering. This is the argument from marginal cases.\n\nThe term artificial moral agent has taken on two usages. The first is in debates on whether it is possible for an artificial system to be a moral agent - see artificial systems and moral responsibility.\nThe second usage stems from efforts to construct machines with ethically-significant behaviors - see machine ethics. \nThe proper distinction between these two usages has itself been a key point of debate.\n\n"}
{"id": "9199846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9199846", "title": "Naacal", "text": "Naacal\n\nNaacal is the name of an ancient people and civilization first claimed to have existed by Augustus Le Plongeon and later by James Churchward. Though there is no scientific or archaeological evidence for the existence of the Naacals, various later fictional works have made use of them.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term \"Naacal\" is contained in Augustus Le Plongeon's work from 1896, \"Queen Moo and the Egyptian Sphinx.\" From pages xxiii - xxiv of the preface:\n\"Perhaps also will be felt the necessity of recovering the libraries of the Maya sages (hidden about the beginning of the Christian era to save them from destruction at the hands of the devastating hordes that invaded their country in those times), and to learn from their contents the wisdom of those ancient philosophers, of which that preserved in the books of the Brahmins is but the reflection. That wisdom was no doubt brought to India, and from there carried to Babylon and Egypt in very remote ages by those Maya adepts (Naacal - \"the exalted\"), who, starting from the land of their birth as missionaries of religion and civilization, went to Burmah, where they became known as Nagas, established themselves in the Dekkan, whence they carried their civilizing work all over the earth.\"\n\nAccording to Augustus Le Plongeon, the Naacals were the missionaries of Mayan religion and civilization. Le Plongeon advocated that the original, great civilization was in Central America which contrasts with Churchward's view.\n\nThe next known published use of the word occurred in 1926 when James Churchward used the term in his book, \"The Lost Continent of Mu, Motherland of Man\".\n\nAccording to James Churchward, the Naacal were the people and civilization of the lost continent of Mu, as well as the name of their language.\n\nAccording to Churchward, the population of the Naacal civilization was as high as 64 million. Their civilization, which flourished 50,000 years ago, was technologically more advanced than the civilization of Churchward's own time (late 19th to early 20th century), and the ancient civilizations of India, Babylon, Persia, Egypt and the Mayas were merely the decayed remnants of Naacal colonies.\n\nChurchward claimed to have gained his knowledge of the Naacals after befriending an Indian priest, who taught him to read the ancient dead language of the Naacals, spoken by only three people in all of India. The priest disclosed the existence of several ancient tablets, written by the Naacals, and Churchward gained access to these records after overcoming the priest's initial reluctance. His knowledge remained incomplete, as the available tablets were mere fragments of a larger text, but Churchward claimed to have found verification and further information in the records of other ancient peoples.\n\nChurchward claimed that the ancient Egyptian sun god Ra originated with the Naacals; he claimed that \"Rah\" was the word which the Naacals used for \"sun\" as well as for their god and rulers.\n\nIn volume 2 of \"The Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East,\" Baird T. Spalding makes this remark about the 'Naacals':\n\"The teachings that Buddha received came from the same source as did those of Osiris but in a different way. The teachings that Buddha contacted came from the Motherland direct to Burma, brought there by the Naacals. Osiris' teachings came direct to him, as his forefathers lived in the Motherland and when he was a young man he had gone to the Motherland to study.\"\nDavid Bruton, Spalding's biographer revealed in \"Baird T. Spalding As I Knew Him\" (IEP, 1956) that Spalding's books were a magical autobiography and essentially fiction. Therefore, the inference that the Naacals themselves are a fiction or modern myth is strengthened.\n\n"}

After the landing at Inchon UN forces moved north toward the Yalu River. Toward the end of October large numbers of Chinese crossed into North Korea. On November 1, they attacked the 8th Cavalry Regiment at Unsan, forcing that Regiment to retreat and decimating the third Battalion. At the same time, other Chinese troops attacked other American units along the Chongchon River, forcing them to retreat also. Fearing a drive which would cut off the 24th Infantry Division,which was advancing up the west coast, General Walker ordered them to withdraw southward. For some reason the Chinese held off any major attacks for over three weeks. At that time, they Pushed UN forces south below the 38th parallel. The entire time, US high command was worried about greater Soviet intervention and perhaps even use of nuclear weapons. With more reinforcements coming from the People's Republic of China, American high command began to fear its ability to win. They began to consider more options involving nuclear weapons.\n\nIn October 1951, the U.S. effected Operation Hudson Harbor to establish nuclear capability against any communist forces and to scare the Soviets from action. B-29 bombers practiced individual runs (using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs) from Okinawa to North Korea. Every factor of these missions could not be the same as an actual nuclear strike, as there is no way to replicate all of the steps from preload testing through the actual release of the bombs while using conventional bombs. The intention was to both be entirely prepared for any ordered strikes and also intimidate the communists with the ease of US ability to fly nuclear bombs overhead. \n\nNuclear cores were deployed and thus the Air Force had several nuclear weapons at their disposal. Command of any nuclear strike was given to General Curtis LeMay. The plan was to destroy large military targets, power plants, and also create a ring of blast zones through Manchuria to dissuade any further intervention from the Communists. Although the use of nuclear weapons was approved, they were never needed because the Chinese and North Koreans eventually signed the Korean Armistice Agreement. In actuality, although the US almost lost the war and was prepared to follow through with the plan, by 1953 the US had pushed the communist forces back across the current armistice line before a ceasefire was called, and thus it was unneeded. \n"}

{"id": "6157423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6157423", "title": "Planetary phase of civilization", "text": "Planetary phase of civilization\n\nThe planetary phase of civilization is a speculative concept defined by the Global Scenario Group (GSG), an environmental organization that specialized in scenario analysis and forecasting. Proponents state that increasing global interdependence and risks, such as climate change, are binding the world into a unitary socio-ecological system. This unprecedented condition signals a historic shift from the period of modernity, characterized by sovereign states, perennial growth of population and economies, abundant resources, and disregard for environmental impacts. The Planetary Phase has many manifestations: economic globalization, biospheric destabilization, mass migration, new global institutions (like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization), the Internet, new forms of transboundary conflict, and shifts in culture and consciousness. Others consider each of these phenomena separately, but give little credence to the theory of a holistic shift in historical dynamics.\n\nThe notion of the planetary phase of civilization rests on extensive sociological and anthropological study done by the GSG. Convened in 1995 by Paul Raskin, President of Tellus Institute, the GSG examined alternative plausible futures by observing trends in societal change in various domains. Their scenarios, published in a series of essays, have been used in numerous regional, local, and global studies including the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP)'s Global Environment Outlook Series (GEO). The Global Scenario Group synthesized its findings for a non-technical audience in the essay \"Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead\". An October 2005 article in the \"Monthly Review\" entitled \"Organizing Ecological Revolution\" described the current \"global environmental crisis\" and the GSG's efforts as \"the most ambitious attempt thus far to carry out such a broad assessment\" of our current and future ecological situation.\n\nIn a historical perspective, the planetary phase of civilization is viewed by its proponents as the third significant transition in civilization. Though history is complex and difficult to divide into discrete eras, they argue that a broad panorama reveals two earlier macro-shifts in human society and culture: shifts from the Stone Age to Early Civilization and then from Early Civilization the Modern Era. Each transition brought a leap in the complexity of society, as seen in changes in social organization, economy, and communications. The Stone Age was characterized by tribes and villages, hunting and gathering economies, and spoken language as the means of communication. The shift into Early Civilization brought more structured city-states and kingdoms, settled agriculture, and writing. Correspondingly, the planetary phase sees social organization, the economy, and communications move to the global level. Moreover, unlike prior transitions, the planetary phase is understood to mark a new geologic era, the Anthropocene, in which human activity becomes the primary driver of changes to the Earth system.\n\nIn \"Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead\", the GSG argues that historical transitions appear to be accelerating, with the longevity of each successive period less than the previous one. Thus, the duration of the Stone Age was on the order of 100,000 years; Early Civilization, 10,000; and Modernity, 1,000. It notes that if the planetary phase takes shape over 100 years, the pattern of acceleration would continue.\n\nThe GSG argues that, while history has entered the planetary phase, the ultimate shape of global civilization remains deeply uncertain. It explores alternative futures through scenario analysis, grouping the possibilities into three broad scenario types: Conventional Worlds, Barbarization, and Great Transitions. Conventional Worlds assume the persistence of currently dominant institutions and cultural values, where the world attempts to address challenges through spontaneous market adaptations or incremental governmental policy changes. The GSG finds Conventional Worlds to be a highly risky path in the planetary phase, a path that could well segue into some form of social devolution (\"Barbarization\"). Thus, the GSG contends that the most desirable scenario would be a Great Transition that incorporates new institutions to promote environmental sustainability, social equity, and lifestyles, once a sufficient level of material prosperity is attained, that emphasize qualitative fulfillment rather than quantitative consumption. These changes would be rooted in the ascendance of a new suite of values – solidarity, ecology, well-being – that would gradually displace the modernist triad of individualism, domination of nature, and consumerism. The political and cultural shift envisioned in this scenario, however, depends on the emergence of a global citizens movement as a potential actor to counter the power of transnational corporations, state governments, and mainstream values.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26636309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26636309", "title": "Progressivism", "text": "Progressivism\n\nProgressivism is the support for or advocacy of improvement of society by reform. As a philosophy, it is based on the idea of progress, which asserts that advancements in science, technology, economic development and social organization are vital to the improvement of the human condition.\n\nThe meanings of progressivism have varied over time and from different perspectives. Progressivism became highly significant during the Age of Enlightenment in Europe, out of the belief that Europe was demonstrating that societies could progress in civility from uncivilized conditions to civilization through strengthening the basis of empirical knowledge as the foundation of society. Figures of the Enlightenment believed that progress had universal application to all societies and that these ideas would spread across the world from Europe. \n\nThe contemporary common political conception of progressivism in the culture of the Western world emerged from the vast social changes brought about by industrialization in the Western world in the late-19th century. Progressives in the early-20th century took the view that progress was being stifled by vast economic inequality between the rich and the poor; minimally regulated \"laissez-faire\" capitalism with monopolistic corporations; and intense and often violent conflict between workers and capitalists, thus claiming that measures were needed to address these problems. Early-20th century progressivism was also tied to eugenics and the temperance movement. Contemporary progressives promote public policies that they believe will lead to positive social change.\n\nImmanuel Kant identified progress as being a movement away from barbarism towards civilization. 18th-century philosopher and political scientist Marquis de Condorcet predicted that political progress would involve the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty. \"Modernity\" or \"modernization\" was a key form of the idea of progress as promoted by classical liberals in the 19th and 20th centuries who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to free markets and free movements of people. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was influential in promoting the idea of progress in European philosophy by emphasizing a linear-progressive conception of history and rejecting a cyclical conception of history. Karl Marx applied to his writings the Hegelian conception of linear-progressive history, the modernization of the economy through industrialization and criticisms of the social class structure of industrial capitalist societies. As industrialization grew, concerns over its effects grew beyond Marxists and other radical critiques and became mainstream.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a political view rose in popularity in the Western world that progress was being stifled by vast economic inequality between the rich and the poor, minimally regulated \"laissez-faire\" capitalism with out-of-control monopolistic corporations, intense and often violent conflict between workers and capitalists and a need for measures to address these problems. Progressivism has influenced various political movements. Modern liberalism was influenced by liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill's conception of people being \"progressive beings\". British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli developed progressive conservatism under \"one-nation\" Toryism. Similarly in Imperial Germany, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck enacted various progressive social welfare measures out of conservative motivations to distance workers from the socialist movement of the time and as humane ways to assist in maintaining the Industrial Revolution. Proponents of social democracy have identified themselves as promoting the progressive cause. The Roman Catholic Church encyclical \"Rerum novarum\" issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891 condemned the exploitation of labour and urged support for labour unions and government regulation of businesses in the interests of social justice while upholding the rights of private property and criticizing socialism. A Protestant progressive outlook called the Social Gospel emerged in North America that focused on challenging economic exploitation and poverty and by the mid-1890s was common in many Protestant theological seminaries in the United States. \n\nIn the United States, progressivism began as a social movement in the 1890s and grew into a political movement in what was known as the Progressive Era. While the term \"American progressives\" represent a range of diverse political pressure groups (not always united), some American progressives rejected social Darwinism, believing that the problems society faced (poverty, violence, greed, racism and class warfare) could best be addressed by providing good education, a safe environment, and an efficient workplace. Progressives lived mainly in the cities, were college educated and believed that government could be a tool for change. American President Theodore Roosevelt of the Republican Party and later the Progressive Party declared that he \"always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand\". President Woodrow Wilson was also a member of the American progressive movement within the Democratic Party.\n\nProgressive stances have evolved over time. Imperialism was a controversial issue within progressivism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the United States where some progressives supported American imperialism while others opposed it.\n\nIn response to World War I, progressive President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points established the concept of national self-determination and criticized imperialist competition and colonial injustices; these views were supported by anti-imperialists in areas of the world that were resisting imperial rule. During the period of acceptance of economic Keynesianism (1930s to 1970s), there was widespread acceptance in many nations of a large role for state intervention in the economy. With the rise of neoliberalism and challenges to state interventionist policies in the 1970s and 1980s, centre-left progressive movements responded by creating the Third Way that emphasized a major role for the market economy. There have been social democrats who have called for the social democratic movement to move past Third Way. Prominent progressive conservative elements in the British Conservative Party have criticized neoliberalism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7877298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7877298", "title": "Samson Option", "text": "Samson Option\n\nThe Samson Option (Hebrew: ברירת שמשון) is the name that some military analysts and authors have given to Israel's deterrence strategy of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons as a \"last resort\" against a country whose military has invaded and/or destroyed much of Israel. Commentators also have employed the term to refer to situations where non-nuclear, non-Israeli actors, have threatened conventional weapons retaliation, such as Yasser Arafat and Hezbollah.\n\nThe name is a reference to the biblical Israelite judge Samson who pushed apart the pillars of a Philistine temple, bringing down the roof and killing himself and thousands of Philistines who had captured him, crying out \"Let me die with the Philistines!\" (\"Judges 16:30\").\n\nIsrael refuses to confirm or deny it has nuclear weapons or to describe how it would use them, an official policy of nuclear ambiguity, also known as \"nuclear opacity.\" This has made it difficult for anyone outside the Israeli government to describe the country's true nuclear policy definitively, while still allowing Israel to influence the perceptions, strategies and actions of other governments. However, over the years, some Israeli leaders have publicly acknowledged their country's nuclear capability: Ephraim Katzir in 1974, Moshe Dayan in 1981, Shimon Peres in 1998, and Ehud Olmert in 2006.\n\nDuring his 2006 confirmation hearings before the United States Senate regarding his appointment as George W. Bush's Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates admitted that Israel had nuclear weapons. In his 2008 book \"The Culture of War\", Martin van Creveld, a professor of military history at Israel's Hebrew University, wrote that since Gates admitted that Israel had nuclear weapons, any talk of Israel's nuclear weapons in Israel can lead to \"arrest, trial, and imprisonment.\" Thus Israeli commentators talk about \"doomsday weapons\" and the Samson Option.\n\nNevertheless, as early as 1976, the CIA believed that Israel possessed 10 to 20 nuclear weapons. By 2002, it was estimated that the number had increased to between 75 and 200 thermonuclear weapons, each in the multiple-megaton range. Kenneth S. Brower has estimated as many as 400 nuclear weapons. These can be launched from land, sea and air. This gives Israel a second strike option even if much of the country is destroyed.\n\nAlthough nuclear weapons were viewed as the ultimate guarantor of Israeli security, as early as the 1960s, the country avoided building its military around them, instead pursuing absolute conventional superiority so as to forestall a last resort nuclear engagement. The original conception of the Samson Option was only as deterrence. According to United States journalist Seymour Hersh and Israeli historian Avner Cohen, Israeli leaders like David Ben-Gurion, Shimon Peres, Levi Eshkol and Moshe Dayan coined the phrase in the mid-1960s. They named it after the biblical figure Samson, who pushed apart the pillars of a Philistine temple, bringing down the roof and killing himself and thousands of Philistines who had captured him, mutilated him, and gathered to see him further humiliated in chains. They contrasted it with ancient siege of Masada where 936 Jewish Sicarii committed mass suicide rather than be defeated and enslaved by the Romans.\n\nIn what they called the \"Last Secret of the Six-Day War\" the \"New York Times\" reported that in the days before the 1967 Six-Day War Israel planned to insert a team of paratroopers by helicopter into the Sinai. Their mission was to set up and remote detonate a nuclear bomb on a mountaintop as a warning to belligerent surrounding states. The greatly outnumbered Jewish state in a surprising turn of events effectively eliminated the Egyptian Air Force and occupied the Sinai winning the war before the test could even be set up. Retired Israeli brigadier general Itzhak Yaakov referred to this operation as the Israeli Samson Option.\n\nIn the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Arab forces were overwhelming Israeli forces and Prime Minister Golda Meir authorized a nuclear alert and ordered 13 atomic bombs be readied for use by missiles and aircraft. The Israeli Ambassador warned President Nixon of \"very serious conclusions\" if the United States did not airlift supplies. Nixon complied. This is seen by some commentators on the subject as the first threat of the use of the Samson Option.\n\nSeymour Hersh writes that the \"surprising victory of Menachem Begin's Likud Party in the May 1977 national elections ... brought to power a government that was even more committed than Labor to the Samson Option and the necessity of an Israeli nuclear arsenal.\"\n\nLouis René Beres, a professor of political science at Purdue University, chaired Project Daniel, a group advising Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. He argues in the Final Report of Project Daniel and elsewhere that the effective deterrence of the Samson Option would be increased by ending the policy of nuclear ambiguity. In a 2004 article he recommends Israel use the Samson Option threat to \"support conventional preemptions\" against enemy nuclear and non-nuclear assets because \"without such weapons, Israel, having to rely entirely upon non-nuclear forces, might not be able to deter enemy retaliations for the Israeli preemptive strike.\"\n\nAri Shavit writes of Israel's nuclear strategy: \"Concerning anything and everything nuclear, Israel would be much, much more cautious than the United States and NATO. Concerning anything and everything nuclear, Israel would be the responsible adult of the international community. It would well understand the formidable nature of the demon and keep it locked in the basement\".\n\nSome have written about the \"Samson Option\" as a retaliation strategy. In 2002, the \"Los Angeles Times\" published an opinion piece by Louisiana State University professor David Perlmutter which the American Jewish author Ron Rosenbaum writes \"goes so far as to justify\" a Samson Option approach:\n\nRosenbaum writes in his 2012 book \"How the End Begins: The Road to a Nuclear World War III\" that, in his opinion, in the \"aftermath of a second Holocaust\", Israel could \"bring down the pillars of the world (attack Moscow and European capitals for instance)\" as well as the \"holy places of Islam.\" He writes that \"abandonment of proportionality is the essence\" of the Samson Option.\n\nIn 2003, a military historian, Martin van Creveld, thought that the Al-Aqsa Intifada then in progress threatened Israel's existence. Van Creveld was quoted in David Hirst's \"The Gun and the Olive Branch\" (2003) as saying: \n\nHowever, it was unlikely Israel could have even targeted Europe as according to Brig. Gen. Yitzhak Yaakov, who was the mastermind behind the \"Samson Option\", Israel did not yet have other measures like bombs or missiles to carry the nuclear payload.\n\nIn 2012, in response to Günter Grass's poem \"Was gesagt werden muss\" (\"What Must Be Said\") which criticized Israel's nuclear weapons program, Israeli poet and Holocaust survivor Itamar Yaoz-Kest published a poem entitled \"The Right to Exist: a Poem-Letter to the German Author\" which addresses Grass by name. It contains the line: \"If you force us yet again to descend from the face of the Earth to the depths of the Earth — let the Earth roll toward the Nothingness.\" \"Jerusalem Post\" journalist Gil Ronen saw this poem as referring to the Samson Option, which he described as the strategy of using Israel's nuclear weapons, \"taking out Israel's enemies with it, possibly causing irreparable damage to the entire world.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The Society was formed in 1974, but it has antecedents which date back to 1844.\n\nCurrently the Society's activities include arranging lectures and other events about Lincolnshire’s history and archaeology, the publication of a journal, a newsletter and books about Lincolnshire. The Society has its headquarters at the Jews' Court in Lincoln, where it has a lecture room, and runs a bookshop for new and secondhand books. It has two branch groups, the Sleaford History Group and the South Holland History Group at Spalding, and also works with other local groups throughout the historic county of Lincolnshire.\n\nThe Lincolnshire Topographical Society was established in 1840 under the patronage of Lord Monson. Among its members were the architects Edward James Willson and William Adams Nicholson. It only published one volume of proceedings and appears to have been defunct by 1843. In 1844 the Lincolnshire Society for the encouragement of Ecclesiastical Antiquities was founded in Louth. Membership was by election and initially this was limited to members of the Anglican church. This is probably the reason why Edward James Willson, a Roman Catholic, did not join this Society. In 1849 the Society changed its name to the Lincolnshire Architectural Society and then in 1853 to the Lincolnshire Diocesan Architectural Society. With the appointment of Archdeacon Edward Trollope as secretary of the Society in 1850, the Society moved to Lincoln and started to publish its proceedings in the \"Reports and Papers\" of the Associated Archaeological Societies. A further name change occurred in 1885 when it became the Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Architectural and Archaeological Society. This was to reflect the removal of the Archdeaconry of Nottingham from the Diocese of Lincoln and the creation of the new Diocese of Southwell. In 1902 Nottinghamshire was dropped from the title. During these early years a high proportion of the members of the Society were clergymen within the Diocese of Lincoln and most of the published articles are about Church history and architecture.\n\nWhile the Lincolnshire Architectural and Archaeological Society continued to publish its papers with the Associated Archaeological Societies until 1936, other developments were taking place. In 1930 the Lindsey Local History Society was founded and it came to publish the \"Lincolnshire Historian\". In 1945 the Lincoln Archaeological Research Committee was founded and this started to conduct a series of notable excavation both in the City of Lincoln and in the County. The Lincolnshire Architectural and Archaeological Society merged with the Lindsey Local History Society in 1965 and,in 1974 the Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology was created by a further mergers with the Lincoln Archaeological Research Committee. and the Lincolnshire Industrial Archaeology Group.\n\n\n"}

The phenomenon is different from chiral amplification, where enantiomeric excess is present from the beginning and not stochastically distributed.

The population was 62,592 as of the 2010 census. The three counties of the Victoria Metropolitan Statistical Area had a population of 111,163 as of the 2000 census.\n\nVictoria is located 30 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. It is a regional hub for a seven-county area known as the \"Golden Crescent\", and serves a retail trade area of over 250,000 people. Victoria is known as \"The Crossroads\" because of its location within a two-hour drive of Corpus Christi, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin.\n\nVictoria is named for General Guadalupe Victoria, who became the first president of independent Mexico. Victoria is the cathedral city of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Victoria in Texas.\n\nThe city of Guadalupe Victoria was founded in 1824 by Martín De León, a Mexican empresario, in honor of Guadalupe Victoria, the first President of the Republic of Mexico. Victoria was initially part of De León's Colony, which had been founded that same year. By 1834, the town had a population of approximately 300.\n\nDuring the Texas Revolution, Guadalupe Victoria contributed soldiers and supplies to pro-revolutionary forces. However, after James Fannin was defeated by the Mexican army at the Battle of Coleto, the town was occupied by Mexican forces. After Santa Anna was defeated at the Battle of San Jacinto, the town's Mexican residents were driven out by Anglo settlers, who renamed it Victoria.\n\nIn 1840, a Comanche raid on nearby Linnville killed many residents of the town. A cholera outbreak occurred in 1846.\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, the city developed a large population of European immigrants, particularly Germans. By the turn of the 20th century, Victoria was experiencing rapid population growth thanks to its position as a regional trade center. The city's advantageous proximity to Gulf Coast ports, the larger cities of San Antonio, Austin, and Corpus Christi, and prosperous industries in agriculture and petrochemicals solidified its prominence.\n\nThe University of Houston–Victoria was founded in 1971.\n\nVictoria is located on the coastal plains of Texas about 50 miles from the Gulf of Mexico and 20 miles from the nearest bay waters. It lies along and just to the east of the Guadalupe River. The topography is mostly flat to slightly rolling with an average elevation of 95 feet. Most of the city is underlain by smectite-rich clay which is locally capped by silt or fine sand; the high shrink-swell potential associated with smectite creates major challenges to urban infrastructure. Vegetation in better-drained areas consists primarily of short grasses with post oaks and other small timber and brush. Moist sites can grow tall forests dominated by elm and pecan.\n\nVictoria is classified as humid subtropical. June through August is very hot and humid with high temperatures regularly exceeding 90 °F. The record high temperature of 111 °F. was recorded in September 2000. Spring and autumn are generally mild to warm with lower humidity. Winters are mild with occasional cold spells. The record low temperature was recorded in December 1989, when the temperature dropped to 9 °F. Snow is very infrequent, usually occurring on average once every 11 years. On December 24–25, 2004, Victoria recorded its first White Christmas ever when 12.5 inches of snow fell.\n\nAverage monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and has a secondary minimum in August, with intense heat and humidity prevailing. On average, the wettest months are May, June, September and October (the last two of these due to significant threat from tropical weather systems, including hurricanes, which can produce torrential rainfalls some years).\n\nVictoria has occasional severe weather, mostly from flooding. Hurricanes have the potential to bring severe damage to the area. Hurricane Claudette in July 2003 was the last hurricane to score a direct hit on the city. During this event, winds gusted to 83 mph at the Victoria Regional Airport and 90% of the city lost power. The most intense hurricane to affect Victoria remains Hurricane Carla in September 1961.\n\nIn May 2013, a rare tornado hit Victoria on a Saturday afternoon with tornado warnings everywhere from Corpus Christi to the southeast Houston/Sugarland Metro area. A short-lived tornado took a swipe at an open field northeast of Victoria, dodging all structures and causing no injuries but kicking up dirt and debris visible for miles. It was rare in the case that the area rarely gets tornados. Though when the Gulf Coast has a tornado it is usually associated \nwith a hurricane. https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2013/may/26/ew_tornado_052613_210572/\n\nAs of census of 2000, 60,603 people, 22,129 households, and 15,755 families resided in the city. The population density was 1,838.3 people per square mile (709.7/km²). There were 24,192 housing units at an average density of 733.8 per square mile (283.3/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 55.2% White, Hispanic or Latino of any race were 42.4% of the population, 7.59% African American, 0.51% Native American, 1.01% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 17.31% from other races, and 2.35% from two or more races.\n\nOf the 22,129 households, 36.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.4% were married couples living together, 14.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.8% were not families. About 24.5% of all households were made up of an individual, and 10.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.68 and the average family size was 3.21.\n\nIn the city, the population was distributed as 28.8% under the age of 18, 9.7% from 18 to 24, 28.0% from 25 to 44, 21.0% from 45 to 64, and 12.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.8 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $36,829, and for a family was $42,866.

About 12.2% of families and 14.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.4% of those under the age of 18 and 12.2% ages 65 or older.\n\nVictoria is administered by a city council of seven members. The council is composed of six council members and an elected mayor, accompanied by a hired city manager under the manager-council system of municipal governance. The council is elected under four single-member districts (numbered 1 through 4), two \"super districts\" (numbered 5 and 6; Super District 5 overlays Districts 1 and 2 while Super District 6 overlays Districts 3 and 4); the mayor is elected at-large.\n\nVictoria also serves as the county seat of Victoria County.\n\nThe Victoria Independent School District serves the city.

The park is also home to more than 15 baseball fields which are occupied during the spring and summer by teams from the Victoria Metro region. Also in Riverside Park on the Guadalupe River is the Victoria Paddling trail. This 4.2-mile stretch of the Guadalupe River is bordered by soft banks rather than the limestone bluffs of the Hill Country.\n\nBoating and freshwater fishing are available at two area reservoirs, Lake Texana and Coleto Lake. Many residents also take advantage of the nearby Gulf of Mexico. Port O'Connor, 50 miles to the southeast, is renowned for bay, off-shore and wade fishing.\n\nThree golf courses are located in Victoria: the Victoria Country Club, Riverside Golf Course, and Colony Creek Country Club.\n\nThe major shopping center is Victoria Mall.\n\nThe UHV Jaguars compete in baseball, softball, soccer, and golf as a member of the Red River Athletic Conference in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Division I.\n\nThe Victoria Generals compete in the Texas Collegiate League, a summer baseball league.

William Carrigan (29 August 1860 – 12 December 1924) was an Irish Roman Catholic priest and historian, who was appointed canon of the Diocese of Ossory.\n\nWilliam Carrigan was the youngest of 13 children. He was born in 1860 in Ruthstown, Ballyfoyle, County Kilkenny.\n\nHe received his childhood education in the Ballyfoyle National School and then in Wellington Square in Kilkenny City. He then attended the ecclesiastical side of St Kieran's College. His education was continued at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth today a part of the larger NUI Maynooth. He was ordained by Francis Moran, Bishop of Ossory, in 1884. His first posting was as curate in Ballyragget. Bishop Moran was a distinguished historian, having founded the Ossory Archaeological Society in 1872. He encouraged William's interests in history and he joined the Ossory Archaeological Society in 1884; his first paper was printed in the last issue of the Ossory Archaeological Society in 1886.\n\nThe 19th century saw a great interest in history. Kilkenny had already seen two major historical works published in 1884, John Hogan's \"History of Kilkenny etc.\" and P. M. Egan's \"Illustrated Guide to the City and County of Kilkenny\". The clergy played an active role in these developments; the Rev. James Graves, an Anglican cleric and antiquarian, was a frequent contributor to the Kilkenny Archaeological Society (renamed in 1890 to Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland). Carrigan with his high interest in local history took these developments as reason to create his own writings. The Bishop of Ossory, Dr Brownrigg, encouraged Carrigan to begin a compilation of a history of Ossory. The Bishop would fund his travels and subscribe to the finished works.\n\nCarrigan travelled around the diocese speaking at great length to older people, taking count of folklore traditions and oral history. We owe it to Carrigan that we still have these today. He also trudged through existing works and resolved conflicting accounts. All of his holidays were spent in the Public Records Office, Dublin, collecting information that related to Ossory.\n\nWilliam Carrigan was 45 when \"The History and Antiquities of Ossory\" was completed. The finished work, divided into four volumes, took six years in the writing, between 1897 and 1903. The first volume deals with the overall history of the diocese from Pre-Christianity Celtic times to the Christianisation and through the Past Bishops and Clergy. The remaining volumes examine Ossory's parishes. It explains each parish's buildings, churches, castles, monuments etc. Townlands are also examined and the origins of their names explained as well as prominent families and tombstone inscriptions etc. Interwoven throughout his narrative in the first volume, is a history of the Kingdom of Ossory and the activity of its rulers, gentry and major clergy; complete with as many annalistic references and other primary sources as he could compile.\n\nIllustrations add to in the richness of his work; photography is used to its full extent. The firm chosen to print the work was Sealy, Bryer and Walker of Middle Abbey Street, Dublin. The firm had long experience of printing historical works. 738 individuals subscribed to the work. 840 copies were sold; the remaining 160 were lost in Dublin during the 1916 Rising. The work was well received on its publication and although other diocesan histories exist, none come to par with it for its range and depth.\n\nCarrigan was created D.D. by the Pope in 1907. He was appointed parish priest of Durrow, County Laois in 1911. He continued to write and collect material; a further volume was planned but was never published. His unpublished works are preserved in the Diocesan Archives in St Kieran's College. Canon Carrigan died on 12 December 1924 as a result of contracting influenza.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19475257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19475257", "title": "William Stearns Davis", "text": "William Stearns Davis\n\nWilliam Stearns Davis (April 30, 1877 – February 15, 1930) was an American educator, historian, and author. He has been cited as one who “contributed to history as a scholarly discipline, . . . [but] was intrigued by the human side of history, which, at the time, was neglected by the discipline.” After first experimenting with short stories, he turned while still a college undergraduate to longer forms to relate, from an involved (fictional) character’s view, a number of critical turns of history. This faculty for humanizing, even dramatizing, history characterized Davis’ later academic and professional writings as well, making them particularly suitable for secondary and higher education during the first half of the twentieth century in a field which, according to one editor, had “lost the freshness and robustness . . . the congeniality” that should mark the study of history. Both Davis’ fiction and non-fiction are found in public and academic libraries today.\n\nDavis was born April 30, 1877 in the presidential mansion of Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts, where his mother's father had been president for the twenty-two years preceding his birth. His father was Congregational minister William Vail Wilson Davis; his mother Francis Stearns. Due both to childhood illnesses and to family moves occasioned by his father's call to new congregations, Davis was largely educated at home until he entered Worcester Academy in 1895. In 1897 he matriculated at Harvard. Fascinated by maps and by historical figures, he had begun writing stories for himself while still at home. He now turned this experience and his desire to humanize history to writing historical novels, the first of which, \"A Friend of Caesar\", was published in the year he graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He continued at Harvard, being the first first-year graduate student to receive the Harvard Thayer Graduate Scholarship, and earning his A.M. in 1901 and his PhD in 1905. During these same years he continued publishing historical fiction.\n\nIn 1904, Davis began his formal teaching career, beginning as a lecturer at Radcliffe College while finishing his doctorate. He continued thereafter at Beloit College (instructor, 1906–07), Oberlin College (Assistant Professor of Medieval and Modern European History, 1907–1909), and finally at the University of Minnesota (Professor of History, 1909–1927). “He was an excellent teacher with the ability to put life into his lectures.” His steady output of non-fiction in both history and the historical background to contemporary world affairs began with his time at Minnesota. Professionally, he was a member of the American Historical Association.\n\nIn 1911, he married Alice Williams Redfield of Minneapolis. He retired from teaching in 1927, moving back to New England and taking up residence in Exeter, New Hampshire, with the intention of devoting all of his time to writing. However, he died of pneumonia following an operation at the age of 52 on February 15, 1930.\n\nDavis’ books are characterized by his desire to tell a story. For his historical fiction, he chose subjects with dramatic flavor, such as the battles of Thermopylae and Salamis, the coming to power of Julius Caesar, Leo the Isaurian’s defense of Constantinople, the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, and the start of the American Revolution. Stylistically, they use narrative of the kind which Josephine Tey called “history-with-conversation”, and his earliest novels have some of the attributes of scholarly publication, including meticulous (and copious) footnotes or appendices. Indeed, a reviewer of a later fictional work noted that previously “Mr. Davis has erred in overabundance of detail. Knowing much is sometimes more troublesome than knowing little, and Mr. Davis's knowledge has in times past seemed too large for his story. In \"Falaise,\" however, this fault is to a most felicitous degree overcome . . . .” The \"American National Biography\" noted that his fictional works “were not classics, . . . but they were accurate and maintained an interesting story line.” He himself would become deeply involved in such writings, to the point of depression when one was finished.\n\nIn a similar manner, the elements of narrative and drama are part of his non-fiction, much of which was written for teaching purposes. His 1910 work on wealth and money in first-century Rome begins with an almost journalistic daily-weekly narrative of bank failures and trading house suspensions leading to a financial panic in 33 AD (which must have read all too familiarly to those who had just weathered the 1907 crash). The opening of \"The Roots of the War\", perhaps his most contemporaneously widely read nonfiction book, portrays Bismarck, Moltke, and Roon at dinner in 1870, planning what would become the Franco-Prussian War. Among his last works, \"Europe Since Waterloo\" (and all the revisions based upon it) begins with a narrative picture of Napoleon on the deck of the British man-o'-war transporting him to his final exile in St. Helena. Forty years later, Kurt Schmeller, producing the latest revision of that work, would say that he “sought to retain the powerful and dramatic narrative of earlier editions”, and Theodore H. Von Laue’s foreword to the same edition would cite Davis’ “forceful, lively, and down-to-earth style” as a motive to retain the core of a work then moving towards a half-century of use.\n\nDavis’ strong anti-German sentiment colored much of his later non-fiction writing, particularly in his articles and letters to various periodicals. He was a forceful advocate of military preparedness in the years leading up to World War I, for which he was duly criticized in the widely pacifistic feeling of the times (see for example the 1916 exchange of letters in \"The Survey\"). During World War I, Davis and many other academic historians desired to support the war but hesitated between a professionally ethical approach to history and a firm belief in President Wilson’s expressed ideals in advocating American intervention in the War. Davis chose to participate in the work of the government-sponsored Committee on Public Information (CPI). Davis in particular provided historical background and context to the Committee's pamphlet on Wilson’s war message to Congress. For this work, in the years following the War, he and the other participants were criticized by some contemporaries belonging to the \"revisionist\" historical school, such as Harry Elmer Barnes. Succeeding next-generation scholars in the same tradition were equally critical. A particularly outspoken critic, C. Hartley Gratton, said of Davis' CPI efforts and of his 1918 \"The Roots of the War\" that there was \"free use of gossip, and the 'revelations' of the Creel Bureau are accepted as definitive truth\". Davis himself would write in 1926 of the earlier work that “very little of [that] hastily prepared material has endured under the cold scrutiny demanded by added information and years of retrospect.”. In view of Davis' retirement and early death, what long-term effect such criticisms might have had upon him is unknowable. Blakey sums up the revisionists' efforts by saying that, however they changed the practice of historical writing, \"their impact on the subsequent lives and careers of the embattled historians was slight to the point of being negligible,\" and this could apply fairly to Davis.\n\nThroughout his writing career, both of fiction and non-fiction, Davis’ \"angle\" to history, as he himself put it in his preface to \"Europe Since Waterloo\", included:\n\n“a belief in a just form of \"nationalism\", and that a devoted loyalty to native land is entirely reconcilable with an ardent love for wide humanity.\n“an intense belief in \"democracy\", . . . and that the modern age is bound to resume the old, old battle against the vicious assumption that some select group of men . . . is competent to decree the destinies of an entire people.\n\n“Finally, . . . a matured belief that only as \"the spirit of Christianity\" penetrates the hearts of men will human brotherhood and wide-spread, enduring happiness be achieved . . . . If the so-called Christian nations and rulers have all too often failed unworthily, their failure has been because they knew not the essence of Christianity, however eagerly they have usurped the name.”\n\nStylistically, Davis never gave up on writing \"stories\" as a medium to convey his love for history as he saw it, and his intense conviction that the knowledge of history should matter to his contemporaries. He had a faculty for describing critical scenes, such as the expulsion of the tribunes in \"A Friend of Caesar\" or Luther before the Diet of Worms in \"The Friar of Wittenberg\". In his day, he was known for his “vivid, almost melodramatic prose style”. \"Twentieth Century Authors\" would credit him with having welded “fact and fiction without loss of narrative intensity or historical plausibility.”\n\n\n\n\n"}
