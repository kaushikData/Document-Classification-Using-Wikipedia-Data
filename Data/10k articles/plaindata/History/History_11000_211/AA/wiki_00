He belonged to the community of Banaphar Rajputs. The Banpahar clan claimed Rajput background.\n\nAccording to the \"Bhavishya Purana\", a text with several interpolated sections that cannot be reliably dated, Alha's mother, Devaki, was a member of the Ahir caste. The Ahirs are among the \"older, pastoralist tradition\", his father was a Rajput of Banaphar Clan \n\nThe \"Bhavishya Purana\" further adds that it is not only the \" two brother of Banaphar Rajput's\" mother who are Ahir, but their paternal grandmother from Baksar are also Ahir, who entered the family with a blessing of \"Devi chandika\" that come not from wrestling buffaloes but from her nine-year vow to the nine Durgas and hence the Ahirs were natural relatives of the family. Some of this checks out with the Elliot's Alha, where the gopalaka (Ahir) King Dalvahana is called Dalpat, King of Gwalior. he is still the two girl's father, but merely gives them to Dasraj and Bachraj when Parmal requested him. The Queen Malhna insists that King Parmal reward Dashraj and Bachraj with brides from within the Chandel land. King Dalpat of Gwalior volunteers his daughters Devi (Devaki, Alha's mother) and Birma. Queen Malhna welcomes Devi to Mahoba by placing the nine lakh chain (Naulakha Haar) around her neck and also gives Birma a necklace. King Parmal then gives new Banaphar families a village where they bear and raise their sons named Alha and Udal.\n\nAlha is one of the heroes of the \"Alha-Khand\" poem, popularly recited in the Bundelkhand region of India. It may be based on a work \"Mahoba Khand\" which has been published with the title \"Parmal Raso\".\n\nAlha is an oral epic, the story is also found in a number of medieval manuscripts of the \"Prithviraj Raso\" and the \"Bhavishya Purana\".

Since his stock has to be transported from Lutetia (modern-day Paris), it will be some time before the next delivery. However Getafix says he can't wait since he needs some for his potion. Asterix and Obelix volunteer to resolve the issue by going fishing, to which end they borrow a boat from Geriatrix. After a storm, they get lost, but despite Obelix's concerns, they do not reach the edge of the world; instead, following a brief encounter with the pirates, they arrive on an island (which the reader surmises is Manhattan Island) with delicious birds that the Gauls call \"gobblers\" (turkeys), bears and \"Romans\" with strange facial paintings (Native Americans).\n\nSoon they earn the \"Romans\"' affection, but they decide to leave after the \"centurion\" chooses Obelix as his rather rubenesque daughter's fiancé. They go to a small island (which the reader surmises is Liberty Island). Seeing a boat coming, Asterix climbs a cairn of rocks holding a torch and a book like the Statue of Liberty to attract it. The crew are anachronistic Norsemen (with names like Herendethelessen, Steptøånssen, Nøgøødreåssen, Håråldwilssen, Irmgard, Firegård, and their Great Dane, Huntingseåssen) - who managed a Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact and take the Gauls, who they thought to be the local natives, to their homeland as proof that there are continents beyond Europe.\n\nThe Gauls wanting to return home, and the Vikings' eagerness to prove their story of a new world, results in a trip back to Europe to the Vikings' homeland. The Vikings' chief, Ødiuscomparissen, greets them and is skeptical of their stories, until he sees the Gauls. They plan a celebration, then attempt to sacrifice the \"natives\", much to the chagrin of the other Vikings (\"Why? They haven't done anything!\").\n\nBefore this can be carried out, a Gaulish prisoner called Catastrofix, who can understand both Gallic and Norse, stirs up Ødiuscomparissen's suspicion that Herendethelessen is a liar, causing a fight between the Norsemen with the assumption that Herendethelessen has simply gone to Gaul rather than to a new world. Meanwhile, the Gauls escape. This escape is conducive to their original purpose, since Catastrofix is a fisherman and hence able to procure some fish for the magic potion. Unhygenix, however, prefers the scent of his own stock; a preference that explains why his product is such a delicate topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was the first known female Chinese historian. She completed her brother Ban Gu's work on the history of the Western Han, the \"Book of Han\". She also wrote \"Lessons for Women\", an influential work on women's conduct. She also had great interest in astronomy and mathematics and wrote poems, commemorative writings, argumentations, commentaries, essays and several longer works, not all of which survive. She became China's most famous female scholar and an instructor of Taoist sexual practices for the imperial family.\n\nBan Zhao was born in Anling, near modern Xianyang, Shaanxi province. At age fourteen, she married a local resident named Cao Shishu, and was called in the court by the name as Venerable Madame Cao (曹大家). Her husband died when she was still young. She never remarried, instead devoting her life to scholarship. She was the daughter of the famous historian Ban Biao and younger of 2 sisters of the general Ban Chao and of historian Ban Gu. She was also the grandniece of the notable scholar and poet Consort Ban.\n\nBan Zhao contributed greatly to the completion and transmission of \"Hanshu\" (漢書, literally the \"Book of the [Former] Han\"), the official dynastic history of the Western Han. After Ban Gu was imprisoned and died in 92 because of his association with the family of Empress Dowager Dou, Ban Zhao helped finish the work by making up for the missing part of the \"Babiao\" (八表 Eight Tables). She added the genealogy of the mother of the emperor, providing much information which was not usually kept. Later, Ma Xu added a treatise on astronomy (天文志), making \"Hanshu\" a complete work.\n\nBan Zhao also wrote the \"Lessons for Women\". This treatise on the education of women was dedicated to the daughters in Ban Zhao's family but was circulated immediately at court. It was popular for centuries in China as a guide for women's conduct.\n\nAccording to the interpretation of classic Western Orientalism, this is a moralistic book, which generally advises women to be compliant and respectful towards the greater purpose of maintaining familial harmony, a highly regarded concept in historical China. According to this interpretation, the book also indicates women should be well-educated so they can better serve their husbands. This interpretation cites translations of passages Ban wrote such as \"Even should the husband say he loves something, when the parents-in-law say no, this is called a case of duty leading to disagreement... Nothing is better than obedience which sacrifices personal opinion.\" \n\nA minor revisionist theory states that the book is a guide to teach women how to avoid scandal in youth so they can survive long enough to become a powerful dowager.\n\nModern interpretations of Lessons for Women indicate that it is a founding text of Confucian feminism. One study notes that it establishes a \"different concept of agency ... forged out of the powerlessness of individual women, which is familial, communal, indirect, and conferred by others.\" \n\nShe taught Empress Deng Sui and members of the court in the royal library, which gained her political influence. The Empress and concubines gave her the title \"Gifted one\" and the empress made her a Lady-in-waiting. As the Empress became regent for the infant Emperor Shang of Han, she often sought the advice of Ban Zhao. In gratitude, the Empress gave both Ban Zhao's sons appointments as officials. Ban Zhao was also a librarian at court, supervising the editorial labors of a staff of assistants and training other scholars in her work. In this capacity, she rearranged and enlarged the \"Biographies of Eminent Women\" by Liu Xiang. It is possible that she supervised the copying of manuscripts from bamboo slips and silk onto a recently invented material, paper.\n\nIn 113, Ban Zhao's son Cao Cheng (曹成) was appointed an official in Chenliu Commandery. Ban accompanied him to Chenliu and wrote about the journey in \"Dong Zheng Fu\" 東征賦), which has survived. After her death, her daughter-in-law, née Ding, gathered her works in the three-volume \"Collected Works of Ban Zhao\", but most have been lost.\n\nBan Zhao crater on Venus is named after her.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1591952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1591952", "title": "Cinecolor", "text": "Cinecolor\n\nCinecolor was an early subtractive color-model two color motion picture process, based upon the Prizma system of the 1910s and 1920s and the Multicolor system of the late 1920s and 1930s. It was developed by William T. Crispinel and Alan M. Gundelfinger, and its various formats were in use from 1932 to 1955.\n\nA bi-pack color process, the photographer loaded a standard camera with two film stocks, an orthochromatic strip dyed red, plus a panchromatic strip behind it. The ortho film stock recorded only blue and green, while its red filtration passed red light to the panchromatic film stock.\n\nIn the laboratory, the negatives were processed on duplitized film and each emulsion was toned red or cyan.\n\nWhile Cinecolor could produce vibrant reds, oranges, blues, browns and flesh tones, its renderings of other colors such as bright greens (rendered dark green) and purples (rendered a sort of dark magenta) were muted.\n\nThe Cinecolor process was invented in 1932 by English-born cinematographer William Thomas Crespinel (1890–1987), who joined the Kinemacolor Corporation in 1906, and who went to New York in 1913 to work with Kinemacolor's American unit. After that company folded in 1916, he worked for Prizma, another color film company, founded by William Van Doren Kelley. He later worked for Multicolor, and patented several inventions in the field of color cinematography.\n\nCrespinel founded Cinecolor, Inc. (later Cinecolor Corporation) in 1932 as a response to the success of the Technicolor Corporation, which held a partial monopoly on motion picture color. William Loss, a director of the Citizens Traction Company in New York, was its principal investor. The company bought four acres of land in Burbank, California for its processing plant. Crespinel retired as president of Cinecolor in 1948.\n\nThe company was largely founded on the patents and equipment of William Van Doren Kelley and his Prizma Color system, and was in direct competition with Multicolor, which folded in 1932. At that point, Cinecolor bought its equipment. Although limited in tone by comparison, Cinecolor's chief advantages over Technicolor were that color rushes were available within 24 hours, that the process itself cost only 25% more than black-and-white photography (the price grew cheaper as larger amounts of Cinecolor film stock were bought), and could be used in modified black-and-white cameras. \n\nBefore 1945, Cinecolor was used almost exclusively for short films. From 1932 to 1935, Cinecolor was used in at least 22 cartoons -- including Fleischer Studios cartoons for Paramount, Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising for MGM; and Ub Iwerks, whose Comicolor cartoons were released by independent distributor Pat Powers – the period when Walt Disney held an exclusive contract with Technicolor for the use of its three-strip process for animation. Among the best known animated short subjects series made in Cinecolor were Poor Cinderella, the first installment of Max Fleischer's \"Color Classics\" and Ub Iwerks' \"ComiColor\" cartoons, several 1930s and 1940s Warner Bros. \"Looney Tunes\", many of Famous Studios' late-1940s \"Popeye the Sailor\" cartoons, and Screen Gems' \"Phantasies\" from 1947 to 1949.\n\nThe first feature-length pictures released in Cinecolor were the documentary feature \"Sweden, Land of the Vikings\" (1934) and the independently made western \"The Phantom of Santa Fe\" (1936, but filmed in Multicolor in 1931), followed by Monogram Pictures' release \"The Gentleman from Arizona\" (1939). No other Cinecolor features followed until 1945. Poverty row companies such as Monogram, Producers Releasing Corporation, and Screen Guild Productions were Cinecolor's chief employers. A 1945 PRC Cinecolor release \"The Enchanted Forest\" was the highest grossing film of that studio. The commercial and critical success of the film led both major and minor studios to use Cinecolor such as MGM's \"Gallant Bess\" (1946). The system could produce acceptable color pictures at a fraction of the cost of Technicolor. Most features made in Cinecolor were westerns, because the main color palette in those films consisted of blues, browns and reds; the system's limitations were thus less apparent.\n\nCinecolor was also prominently employed in processing Paramount's \"Popular Science\" series of short films – although later prints were made by Consolidated Film Industries under their Magnacolor process. Hal Roach Studios made all four of its features in Cinecolor in 1947–1948, becoming the first Hollywood studio to do an all-color schedule. The last American feature released in Cinecolor was Allied Artists' \"Pride of the Blue Grass\" (1954). \n\nRepublic Pictures began using CFI's Trucolor from the end of 1946 for a variety of films ranging from Westerns, travelogues, and epics of the life of Richard Wagner (\"Magic Fire\") and the battle of the Alamo (\"The Last Command\"). Trucolor differed, however, in that it used a dye-coupler already built into the film base, rather than the application of chemical toner.\n\nThe year 1948 was a major one for the Cinecolor Corp. Aside from growing film stock prices, they introduced a new, hyper-sensitive stock and film magazines, which cut back on the on-set lighting costs by 50%, and kept the cost of shooting in Cinecolor only 10% more than black and white.\n\nThe same year, Gundelfinger also developed a three-color process called SuperCinecolor, but did not begin using it until 1951 with \"The Sword of Monte Cristo\". Other films of note that used the SuperCinecolor process were \"Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd\" (1952), \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" (1952), \"Invaders From Mars\" (1953), \"Gog\" (1954), and \"Top Banana\" (1954). The latter two were both also filmed in 3-D.\n\nSuperCinecolor utilized black-and-white matrices made primarily by monopack color negatives made with Ansco/Agfa, DuPont, Kodachrome, or Eastmancolor film, for principal photography. After the negative was edited, it was copied through color filters into three black-and-white negatives. An oddity of the system was that rather than use cyan, magenta and yellow primary subtractive colors, SuperCinecolor printed their films with red, blue and yellow matrices in order to create a system that was compatible with the previous printers. The result of the combination of color spectra was an oddly striking look to the final print.\n\nPrinting SuperCinecolor was not a difficult process as it was engineered to utilize the old process' equipment. Using duplitized stock, one side contained a silver emulsion toned red-magenta, and on the other side, cyan-blue. A yellow layer was added on the blue side through means of imbibition. The soundtrack was subsequently applicated on the blue-yellow side in a blue soundtrack, but separate from those records. The final prints had vivid dyes that did not fade, were of acceptable grain structure and sharp in focus. The common perception of Cinecolor prints being grainy and not easily focused is perpetrated by 16 mm, regular-process Cinecolor prints, where these elements are an issue.\n\nCinecolor Corp. operated at a net loss from 1950 through 1954, partly because the weak financial position of its division in England made it necessary for the parent company to refinance it, and partly because of its own operating losses. Donner Corporation, a private investment organization, acquired Cinecolor Corp. in June 1952. In 1953, it became the Color Corporation of America, and specialized in SuperCinecolor printing, as well as being a major Anscocolor processor. It also made Eastmancolor prints, did commercial film processing and printing of non-theatrical films, and black-and-white film processing for television. To stimulate its theatrical film business, Color Corp. financed independent movie producers. The last theatrical feature with a SuperCinecolor credit was \"The Diamond Queen\", released by Warner Bros. in November 1953. Thereafter, \"Color by Color Corp. of America\" was used for films like \"Shark River\" (1953) and \"Top Banana\" (1954).\n\nColor Corporation of America was bought out on April 8, 1954 by Houston Color Film Laboratories, which processed Anscocolor at its plant in Los Angeles, and Houston Fearless Corp., which made processing and developing equipment. It became strictly an Anscocolor processor. Color Corp. sold its film processing laboratory in mid-1955 to provide its television and motion picture equipment-making division a laboratory in which to test its equipment, and the corporation was dissolved.\n\n\n\n"}

Eusebie had embraced Romanian nationalism from the 1870s, against the conservatism of the boyar class; George radicalize himself even further, by introducing social demands into the nationalist program and seeking direct backing from the peasants.\n\nGeorge entered a local primary school in 1870, followed by the German high school four years later. While a student there, he and several classmates edited a magazine in manuscript form, \"Întreprinderea\". He graduated in 1882, immediately joining Societatea Academică Junimea, the Romanian cultural club. That autumn, he entered the law faculty of Czernowitz University. Rising from secretary to president of Junimea for the 1883–1884 year, he was part of a quartet that organized a ten-year celebration of Arboroasa in 1885. During his university years, he published historical studies and poetry both in the Czernowitz-based \"Candela\" and in \"Convorbiri Literare\" and \"Sămănătorul\", from the Kingdom of Romania. In the summer of 1885, he took part in maneuvers at Stanislau with the Austro-Hungarian Army. He graduated university in 1888; the same year, he left to continue his studies at the University of Innsbruck, but a serious illness prevented this for nearly two years. Popovici earned his doctorate in 1894.\n\nAt the beginning of 1897, he undertook a study trip to Vienna, Innsbruck and Berlin. He then returned to Czernowitz in order to campaign for a seat in the Austrian House of Deputies at the March election, joining the Concordia Society (or National Romanian Party, PNR) of Ioan Zotta and Modest Grigorcea. He won the seat with 597 of 625 votes cast, and represented the southern portion of Bukovina: Storojineț, Siret, Rădăuți, Suceava, Gura Humorului and Câmpulung Moldovenesc. He ran on an agrarian-focused platform, declaring: \"All the lands of our empire, and of other empires as well, are marching toward economic betterment while us Bukovinans have lagged behind, so therefore I promise to do everything necessary to mend the economic state of our Bukovinan peasant.\" During that stage of his career, Popovici also believed that all Romanian provinces would be united under Austrian rule.\n\nDissatisfied with the conservative Concordia, in April 1897 Popovici entered the Romanian National People's Party (PNPR), a more radical nationalist group whose ideologue was Iancu Flondor. He served on its leadership board, with, among others, Grigorcea, Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi, Varteres von Prunkul, Ion Țurcan, and his uncle C. C. Popovici. Later, he and Graf Wassilko where co-opted on the Party Directorate; Popovici also served on the electoral board of Czernowitz. Eusebie Popovici also joined the new group, and, in 1898, became a member of its electoral board in Suceava.\n\nIn autumn 1897, Popovici proposed before parliament the establishment of an appeals court for Bukovina, and participated in a peasants' assembly at Vienna that gathered together representatives of the empire's rural Romanian population. In March 1898, he delivered a speech in parliament where he called for the rights of the peasantry to be respected in the matter of land rents. He was the party rapporteur on the issue of regional autonomy, which the PNPR supported as part of a right-wing coalition in the House, against the objections of German nationalists. Also in 1898, after a heated campaign with accusations of fraud against his competitors, he won a seat in the Diet for the rural constituency of Câmpulung Moldovenesc. When not engaged in political campaigning, he submitted entries on old Romanian law to \"Enciclopedia română\", which appeared that same year. Meanwhile, his fiancée Virginia, the daughter of cultural figure Dionisie Bejan, died.\n\nIn May 1899, Popovici held a passionate speech before a join session of imperial legislators held in Budapest, calling on Romania to join the Triple Alliance and warning of the threat posed by the Russian Empire. In the spring of 1899, he signed his name to a formal protest against the Bourguignon von Baumberg, the Bukovina Governor, accusing him of being anti-Romanian and of censoring the local nationalist press. He also stood up against the governor's ban on public displays of the Romanian tricolor, arguing that the colors were naturally found on Romanian folk costumes, which would risk being banned. This was followed in September by another protest, prompted by Bourguignon's conflict with the Orthodox clergy, including his own father. By 1900, Popovici had stopped participating in sessions of the Diet, in protest at the older Bukovina Romanian politicians' policy of concessions and patience with the Austrian authorities. The PPNR split into factions, but the core group, steered by Flondor and Popovici, endured, hoping to rely on renewed support from the Romanian peasantry.\n\nIn August, he became president of the reconstructed PNPR. In summer 1900, he ran for re-election to the Vienna parliament, but lost to an accommodationist candidate, Dimitrie Isopescu. Beset by campaign debts, Popovici left Austrian territory settled in Bucharest, capital of the Kingdom of Romania. He refused to run again for a vacated seat the House, citing \"personal reasons\"; his absence cleared the way for Tudor Flondor, who was Iancu's brother and political rival. In the spring of 1901, at Bucharest, Popovici married Maria, the daughter of politician Ștefan C. Șendrea.\n\nPopovici renounced Austrian citizenship upon emigrating, and was naturalized a Romanian citizen in February 1902. He continued to publish studies in 1903, gave lectures at the Romanian Atheneum, and in 1904 submitted material on Romanian diplomacy to \"Enciclopedia română\". He was working on a large-scale volume dealing with the history of Romanian law, but never finished it; instead, he helped his fellow nationalist historian, Nicolae Iorga, reviewing for print his texts in German. Popovici was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in April 1905. However, he was blocked in his bid for the chair of Romanian law at the University of Bucharest, after conservative Bukovinans launched a press campaign against him. According to Iorga: \"A Bukovinan made a fuss in the papers, in the newspaper \"Conservatorul\", spewing insults at this correct, modest and delicate man, this man who had never insulted anyone; a veritable camp emerged at the Faculty to block his entry. We know how much that insult hurt him, how he knew who the perpetrator was, and how, knowing this, he knew that he could expect no vindication [of his honor] from him\".\n\nReportedly, the peasants of Bukovina continued to hold Popovici in high esteem, and kept copies of his portrait. By then, Iancu Flondor had replaced him as president of the PNPR. Flondor was accused by adversary Aurel Onciul of the Democratic Peasants' Party of having plagiarized his friend's projects for electoral reform; Onciul also claimed that Popovici had only stayed by Flondor's side because he was being paid to.\n\nThat July, some time after visiting Iorga in Bucharest, Popovici left for Hungary. He as reportedly ashamed by prospects of insolvency and one night, while at an inn in Munkács, took a lethal dose of morphine. A letter and six telegrams were found in his room. The letter was addressed to the town's administrator, while the telegrams were for family members, a friend and the prefect of the Bucharest police. He left no indication of why he committed suicide, instead giving instructions as to his burial. Popovici was buried in his native city.\n\nIn his \"Sămănătorul\" obituary, Iorga argued: \"Among those who were brought down by our sins, among those who were murdered by the stupidity and wickedness of this nation, I know none for whom more tears should be spilled. He was of pure gold, blocking the path of those who, with lead as their ornament, have trampled on him.\" A posthumous volume of poetry was published in 1908 by Ștefan Octavian Iosif, with a preface by Iorga. These and other works appeared under the pen name T. Robeanu; the moniker originated with an 1885 pun addressed to his then-fiancée: \"Te robea, nu?\" (\"He enslaved you, no?\").\n\n"}

{"id": "40478017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40478017", "title": "Impossibilism", "text": "Impossibilism\n\nImpossibilism is a Marxist theory and perspective on the emergence of socialism that stresses the limited value of political, economic, cultural and social reforms within a capitalist economy. It argues that the pursuit of such reforms is counterproductive because they stabilize and strengthen support for capitalism, thereby helping to ensure its continuation. Impossibilism holds that the pursuit of reforms should not be a major concern for socialists because such reforms are irrelevant, if not counter-productive, to the realization of socialism.\n\nImpossibilism insists that socialists should solely (or at the least, primarily) focus on structural changes (sometimes termed \"revolutionary changes\") to society as opposed to advancing social reforms. Impossibilists argue that spontaneous revolutionary action is the only viable method of instituting the structural changes necessary for the construction of socialism. Impossibilism is thus held in contrast to reformist socialist parties that aim to rally support for socialism through the implementation of popular social reforms (such as a welfare state) and those who believe that socialism can emerge through gradual economic reforms implemented by an elected social democratic political party.\n\nImpossibilism is the opposite of \"possibilism\" and \"immediatism\". Possibilism and immediatism are based on a gradualist path to socialism and a desire on the part of socialists to help ameliorate the social ills \"immediately\" through practical programs implemented by existing institutions such as labor unions and electoral politics, thereby de-emphasizing the ultimate objective of building a socialist economy. As a result, socialists who embraced possibilism and immediatism sounded and acted little different from non-socialist reformers.\n\nImpossibilist movements are also associated with anti-Leninism in their opposition to both vanguardism and democratic centralism.\n\nThe concept of impossibilism—though not the specific term—was introduced and heavily influenced by American Marxist theoretician Daniel De Leon on the basis of theory that De Leon generated before his interest in syndicalism began. It came to be focused especially on the question of whether socialists should take part in government and pursue policy reforms that benefited the working-class under capitalism.\n\nAt the Paris Congress of the Second International in 1900, those who favored entry into government with all the implied compromises called themselves \"Possibilists\" while those who opposed them (those around Jules Guesde) characterized them as political \"Opportunists\". Conversely, the revolutionary socialists who opposed ameliorative reforms and participation in existing governments were called \"Impossibilists\" by their detractors because they allegedly sought the impossible by refusing to partake in the governing of capitalism.\n\nWhile not usually described as an impossibilist, Rosa Luxemburg opposed both reformism and vanguardism, taking the more classical Marxist perspective that revolution would be a spontaneous reaction to underlying material changes in the productive forces of society. According to Luxemburg, under reformism \"[capitalism] is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms\".\n\nKarl Marx famously critiqued reformism and immediatist/possibilist goals advocated by modern social democrats in his \"Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League\" (1850). Specifically, he argued that measures designed to increase wages, improve working conditions and provide welfare payments would be used to dissuade the working class away from socialism and the revolutionary consciousness he believed was necessary to achieve a socialist economy and would thus be a threat to genuine structural changes to society by making the conditions of workers in capitalism more tolerable through reform and welfare schemes.\n\nImpossibilism was particularly popular in British Columbia in the early 20th century through the influence of E. T. Kingsley. Several members of Kingsley's Socialist Party of Canada (SPC) were elected to the British Columbia legislature between 1901 and 1910. It is also said to be the basis of the theory and practice of the oldest existing British Marxist party, the Socialist Party of Great Britain (SPGB), founded in 1904; and the international World Socialist Movement, though they reject this description.\n\nIn the United States, the De Leonist Socialist Labor Party of America was viewed as \"impossibilist\" by its opponents, particularly those in the electorally-oriented Socialist Party of America. A more self-consciously impossibilist organization emerged in 1920 as the Proletarian Party of America, an organization headed by the Scottish-born John Keracher which was directly influenced by the ideas of the SPGB and the SPC.\n\nIn France, Jules Guesde and the French Workers' Party were accused of impossibilism.\n\n\n\n"}

With the invention of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), launch on warning became an integral part of mutually assured destruction (MAD) theory. Under the strategy, a retaliatory strike is launched upon warning of enemy nuclear attack while its missiles are still in the air and before detonation occurs. U.S. land-based missiles can reportedly be launched\nwithin five minutes of a presidential decision to do so, and submarine-based missiles within 15 minutes.\n\nBefore the introduction of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the U.S. Strategic Air Command had multiple bombers on patrol at all times like, presumably, its Soviet counterpart. In the event of a nuclear strike by one of the nations, the other nation would order its bombers to fly to the other country and drop their nuclear payload on predetermined targets. In the United States, the bombers were typically either B-47 Stratojets or B-52 Stratofortresses, and there were three major flight routes. Keeping bombers in the air assured that a second strike would be feasible even if the first strike were to impair ground facilities. At the height of the Cold War, the United States had special Boeing EC-135 \"Looking Glass\" aircraft equipped as control centers for the nuclear arsenal. The battle staff included a general or flag officer who was authorized to order a retaliatory strike if the President could not be contacted.\n\nLaunch on warning has its roots in US President Dwight Eisenhower's \"Positive Control\" strategy but really took shape with the introduction of the Minuteman missile. Since many ICBMs (including the Minuteman) were launched from underground silos, the concern arose that a first strike, by one nation, could destroy the ground launch facilities of the retaliating nation.\n\nIn 1997, the Clinton administration changed the official policy away from launch on warning to one of retaliation after withstanding an initial first strike.\n\nThe introduction of nuclear-tipped ICBMs required new strategies because unlike bombers, ICBMs cannot be recalled after launch. There were two primary options. One option, \"retaliation after ride-out\", required the second-strike nation to wait until after it was attacked to launch their missiles. Some portion of the nuclear arsenal would inevitably be destroyed in such an attack, which led to both superpowers investing heavily in survivable basing modes for their nuclear forces, including hardened underground missile silos for ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The other choice was \"launch on warning\", launching nuclear missiles before the other side's missiles could destroy them. That became possible primarily because of improvements in missile technology that allowed for faster launches, along with invention of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System in the early 1960s, which made it possible for the US to detect the launch of Soviet missiles. The capability was further enhanced in the 1970s with the deployment of space-based launch detection technology on both sides, the American geosynchronous Defense Support Program and Soviet Oko satellites. Evidence found in declassified documents suggests that launch on warning was at least in part the policy of the United States from the late 1950s through to at least the 1970s.\n\nStrategies are available that can reduce the effectiveness of a launch-on-warning stance. For example, the first-strike nation can use a technique called X-ray pin-down to delay a retaliatory response. It involves a barrage of submarine-based missiles fired from close range in a \"depressed trajectory\" mode that reaches its targets in minutes. The warheads would be set to explode every minute or so at high altitudes, which significantly disrupts the ability of the attacked nation to launch its own ICBMs. Additionally, submarines could launch a depressed-trajectory strike against the capital of the targeted country in an effort to destroy its command structure before any retaliatory decision could be made; that is known as a decapitation strike.\n\nThe deployment of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) decreases the strategic need for a launch-on-warning strategy. These submarines are capable of hiding in the ocean during an attack, thus ensuring that a second strike can be made even if the attacked country is unable to launch a land-based counterstrike.\n\n\n"}

The book, a defence of the ancients against the moderns, \"did not\", according to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition\", \"take into account the fact that only the best of ancient literature has come down to us.\" Girardin's \"oeuvre\" was, overall, very hostile toward Romanticism.\n\nGirardin's other works included \"Essais de littérature\" (2 vols., 1844), made up chiefly of contributions to the \"Débats\", his \"Notices sur l'Allemagne\" (1834), and many volumes of collected \"Souvenirs\", \"Réflexions\", etc., on foreign countries and passing events (including his notes on the period of Russian administration in the Danubian Principalities). His last major works were \"La Fontaine et les Fabulistes\" (1867) and an \"Étude sur J.-J. Rousseau\" (1870) which had appeared in the \"Revue des deux mondes\".\n\n"}
{"id": "530216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=530216", "title": "Media coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict", "text": "Media coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict\n\nMedia coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict by journalists in international news media has been said to be biased by both sides and independent observers. These perceptions of bias, possibly exacerbated by the hostile media effect, have generated more complaints of partisan reporting than any other news topic and have led to a proliferation of media watchdog groups.\n\nBias in print and broadcast media may manifest itself in varying ways, including:\n\nDiction, or word choice, affects the interpretation of the same set of entities or events. There is an emotional and semantic difference between the verbs \"died\" and \"killed,\" and similarly between \"kill\" and \"murder\"; \"murder\" evokes stronger negative emotions and connotes intent. In the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, various terminological issues arise. The terms \"disputed territories\" versus \"occupied territories\" reflect different positions on the legal status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The terms \"security fence\" and \"apartheid wall,\" \"neighbourhood\" and \"settlement,\" and \"militant,\" \"freedom fighter,\" and \"terrorist,\" while used to describe the same entities, present them in a different light and suggest a different narrative. Similarly, describing an attack or bombing as a \"response\" or \"retaliation\" again places the events in a different light.\n\nA study by the American organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting monitored the use of the term \"retaliation\" in the nightly news broadcasts of the three main American networks CBS, ABC, and NBC between September 2000 through March 17, 2002. It found that of the 150 occasions when \"retaliate\" and its variants were used to describe attacks in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, 79 percent were references to Israel \"retaliating\" and only 9 percent were references to Palestinians \"retaliating\".\n\nIn a study of BBC television news coverage, the Glasgow Media Group documented differences in the language used by journalists for Israelis and Palestinians. The study found that terms such as \"atrocity,\" \"brutal murder,\" \"mass murder,\" \"savage cold blooded killing,\" \"lynching\" and \"slaughter\" were used to describe the death of Israelis but not the death of Palestinians. The word \"terrorist\" was often used to describe Palestinians. However, in reports of an Israeli group attempting to bomb a Palestinian school, members of the Israeli group were referred to as \"extremists\" or \"vigilantes\" but not as \"terrorists.\"\n\nIn the context of media, an omission refers to the failure to include information. This selective inclusion of information, which results from omitting other information, may distort the presentation of events in favor of one side or the other. In the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, for example, consider the difference in overall impact between:\n\nIn a 2001 study done by FAIR, only 4% of the US media mentioned that an occupation by Israel is occurring. In an update to the study, the number has reportedly gone down to only 2% of the media mentioning an occupation. The 2001 figure is also seen in the documentary \"Peace, Propaganda and the Promised Land\".\n\nCommittee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) (a pro-Israel group) notes that factual errors can be errors of omission, where something important was not said, resulting in readers being misled, or commission, where information used is not true. Honest Reporting have asked the following questions : \"was the reporting one-sided and imbalanced?\";and \"was key information missing (selective omission)?\"\n\nPalestine Media Watch in its \"Media critique quick sheet\" asked the following questions: \"how many times were UN reports/findings/resolutions mentioned?\"; \"How many times were Human Rights reports/findings/statements mentioned?\"; \"did the story describe official Palestinian denials/pleas of ignorance and innocence in violent acts?\" and \"did the story describe official Israelis denials/pleas of ignorance and innocence in violent acts?\"\n\nThe ethics and standards of journalism require journalists to verify the factual accuracy of the information they report. Factual verification\" is what separates journalism from other modes of communication, such as propaganda, fiction or entertainment\". Lack of verification involves the publication of potentially unreliable information prior to or without independent confirmation of the facts, and has resulted in various scandals. In the context of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, for example, consider:\n\nHonest Reporting (a pro-Israel group) believe that many media outlets devoted huge amounts of ink to \"unverified Palestinian tales of conspiracies, mass murders, common graves, and war crimes.\"\nCAMERA believe that when dealing with vilification of Israel, facts remain unchecked, accusations remain unverified, and journalistic responsibility is replaced by disclaimers.\n\nSelective reporting involves devoting more resources, such as news articles or air time, to the coverage of one side of the story over another. Honest Reporting has asked whether \"equal time\" was granted to both sides of the conflict, or was one side given preferential treatment – hence lending more weight and credibility to that side's positions.\n\nIn the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, FAIR believe the media in the United States downplay violence against Palestinians and stated that National Public Radio reported more Israeli casualties of the Arab–Israeli conflict than Palestinian casualties by percentage. CAMERA made the opposite complaint – that NPR gave pro-Arab speakers 77% more time than Israeli or pro-Israeli speakers, and segments that included only pro-Arab speakers were almost twice as numerous and four times as long as those that omitted Arab speakers altogether.\nDecontextualization is a type of omission in which the omitted information is essential to understanding a decision, action, or event, its underlying motivations or key events leading up to it. In the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, for example, consider the effect of the following:\n\nHonest Reporting believe that failing to provide proper context and full background information, journalists can dramatically distort the true picture. CAMERA believes it to be a frequent problem when reporting about the Middle East.\n\nPrint and broadcast media may be biased for varying reasons, including:\n\nCoercion or censorship refers to the use of intimidation or force to promote favorable reports and to confiscate unfavorable reports. In the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, both sides accuse each other of coercion or censorship as an explanation of alleged bias in favor of the other side. In support of these claims, Israeli advocates point to kidnappings of foreign reporters by Palestinians, while Palestinian advocates point to media blackouts and confiscation of reports by Israelis. Additionally, both sides point to reports by both governmental and non-governmental organizations, which assess the degree of journalistic freedom in the region. See Media of Israel and Human rights in Israel#Freedom of speech and the media.\n\nForgery or falsification involves the intentional misrepresentation, alteration, or invention of reported information. Due to the severity of these actions, which violate the ethics and standards of journalism, instances of forgery and/or falsification are frequently cited by Israelis and their advocates and/or by Palestinians and their advocates—depending on the nature of the forgery and/or falsification—in order to support claims that the media favors the other side.\nHonestReporting commented on the 2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies that \"A Reuters photo turns out to be an outright lie, manipulated to make damage in Beirut appear much worse than reality.\" For additional claims see Pallywood\n\nAccording to CAMERA,\n\nheadlines are the first, and sometimes only, news items seen by readers and should provide the accurate and specific essence of a news story. It criticized \"The New York Times\" for the placement of news stories about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, focusing heavily on Palestinian suffering while continually minimizing the personal toll on Israelis.\n\nSensationalism, in general, is a form of being extremely controversial, loud, or attention grabbing. In the context of the media, sensationalism refers to claims that the media chooses to report on shocking events or to exaggerate, at the expense of accuracy and objectivity, in order to improve viewer, listener or readership ratings. This criticism, also known as media circus, is proffered by both Israelis and Palestinians as a possible explanation for alleged bias.\n\nHonestReporting believes a new de facto \"stylebook\" is being used by the media which sensationalize the intensity and scope of Israeli military actions. the following regarding sensationalism: CAMERA criticized \"Haaretz\" for using a sensational headline:\n\nJournalists may intentionally or unintentionally distort reports due to political ideology, national affiliation, antisemitism, anti-Arabism, or Islamophobia.\n\nRichard Falk, United Nations special rapporteur on Palestinian human rights, has stated that in the media-distorted picture surrounding the Middle East, those who reports honestly and factually are accused of bias, whereas pro-Israel bias is perceived as mainstream. Falk has stated that because the media don't adequately report violations of international law by Israel, \"the American public isn't aware of the behavior of Israel or the victimization of the Palestinian people. This creates a kind of imbalance.\"\nCAMERA attributed Christiane Amanpour's allegedly biased news coverage to her political ideology; Ira Stoll of the \"New York Sun\", and formerly of the \"Jerusalem Post\", attributes alleged anti-Israel media bias in part to reporters of Jewish background.\n\nIn order to substantiate claims that the media favors the other side, participants in the conflict on each side frequently cite a number of illustrative and extreme examples of controversial reporting. This section lists incidents of controversial reporting frequently cited by only Israelis and Israel advocates, by only Palestinians and Palestinian advocates, or by both sides. The list of incidents appear chronologically, according to when the incident took place. Where events took place on the same date, the incidents appear sorted alphabetically.\n\nOn September 30, 2000, the 11- to 12-year-old boy, Muhammad al-Durrah, was shot in Palestinian-Israeli crossfire at the Netzarim junction. France 2, which caught the incident on tape, claimed that Israel had fatally shot the boy. After an official, internal investigation, the IDF conceded that it was probably responsible and apologized for the shooting. Al-Durrah became a symbol of the Second Intifada and of Palestinian martyrdom.\n\nExternal investigations suggested that the IDF could not have shot the boy and that the tape had been staged. In 2001, following a non-military investigation, conducted by Israeli Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Yom Tov Samia, the Israeli Prime Minister's Foreign Media Advisor, Dr. Ra'anan Gissin, along with Daniel Seaman of the Israeli Government Press Office (GPO) publicly challenged the accuracy of the France 2 report. In 2005, the head of the Israeli National Security Agency, Major-General (res.) Giora Eiland publicly retracted the IDF's initial admittance of responsibility. In order to avoid negative publicity and a resulting backlash, the IDF did not conduct its own official, military investigation until 2007. On October 1, 2007, Israel officially denied responsibility for the shooting and claimed that the France 2 footage had been staged, prompting criticism from Al-Durrah's father.\n\nHowever, in early 2012, Dr. David Yehudah was sued by al-Dura's father and was acquitted in French court.\n\nThe French defamation case was definitely settled on June 26, 2013, by the French Court of Appeals: Philippe Karsenty was convicted of defamation and fined €7,000 by the Paris Court of Appeals. Karsenty's version, which described the killing of young Mohammed Al Durah as \"staged\", was rejected by the French Court's final decision.\n\nOn September 30, 2000, \"The New York Times\", the Associated Press, and other media outlets published a photograph of a club-wielding Israeli police officer standing over a battered and bleeding young man. The photograph's caption identified the young man as a Palestinian and the location as the Temple Mount. The young man in the picture was 20-year-old Tuvia Grossman, a Jewish American student from Chicago who had been studying at a Yeshiva in Israel; the Israeli police officer in the photograph, actually came to his rescue by threatening his Palestinian assailants.\n\nAfter a complaint by Grossman's father, \"The New York Times\" issued a correction on October 4. A few days later the \"Times\" published an article about the incident and printed a more complete correction. The \"Times\" attributed the error to a misidentification by the Israeli agency that took the photo compounded by a further misidentification by the Associated Press \"which had received many pictures of injured Palestinians that day\".\n\nThe Grossman photo appears frequently in Israeli criticisms of the media, because the photograph implied that the police officer who rescued Grossman had beaten him, it implied an Israeli perpetrator, it implied a Palestinian victim, and it conveyed the opposite of what had transpired. Seth Ackerman of FAIR described the attention given to the photo, as well as the two \"NYT\" corrections, as disproportionate to a \"plausible, though careless\" assumption resulting from \"garbled information from the Israeli photographer\".\n\nOn April 3, 2002, following the Passover massacre on March 27 which killed 30 Israeli civilians and wounded as many as 143, the IDF began a major military operation in the Jenin refugee camp, a city which, according to Israel, had \"served as a launching site for numerous terrorist attacks against both Israeli civilians and Israeli towns and villages in the area\". The fighting, which lasted eight days and resulted in the deaths of 52 Palestinians (including 14 civilians, according to the IDF, and 22 civilians, according to HRW) and 23 Israeli soldiers, has been interpreted quite differently by Israelis and Palestinians. In the aftermath of the fighting, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat claimed that the IDF had killed 500 Palestinians and accused Israel of committing a \"massacre\". Early news publications, following both IDF estimates of 200 Palestinians killed and Palestinian estimates of 500 Palestinians killed, reported hundreds of Palestinian deaths and repeated claims that a massacre had taken place. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International later found that no massacre had taken place, although both organizations charged the IDF with war crimes and human rights violations. The United Nations similarly dismissed claims that hundreds of Palestinians had been killed as unsubstantiated, a finding which was widely interpreted and reported as rejecting claims of a \"massacre\".\n\nIsraelis cite the reporting surrounding the Battle of Jenin, because \"the Arab and European media hastily reported\", without proper verification, Palestinian allegations that a massacre had taken place, a claim broken by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, and described by many pro-Israel sources as \"The Big Jenin Lie\" and by HonestReporting as \"Jeningrad\".\n\nOn June 9, 2006, an explosion on a beach in the Gaza Strip killed seven Palestinians, including three children. Palestinian sources claimed that the explosion resulted from Israeli shelling. After a three-day investigation, Israel concluded that the blast could not have resulted from an IDF artillery shell. This IDF investigation was criticized by both Human Rights Watch and \"The Guardian\" for ignoring evidence. The IDF agreed that the report should have mentioned two gunboat shells fired at about the time of the deaths but stated that these shells had landed too far away from the area to be the cause of the explosion and this omission did not impact the report's overall conclusion that Israel had not been responsible for the blast. According to Human Rights Watch, the IDF acknowledged that the cause of the blast may have been an unexploded 155mm artillery shell from an earlier shelling, or another location, but suggested it might have been placed there as an IED by Palestinians.\n\nAn investigation by Human Rights Watch concluded that the explosion was caused by a 155mm Israeli artillery shell, stating that 'The shrapnel, crater, and injuries all point to this weapon as the cause.' According to CAMERA, \"many in the press [have presumed] that Israel is responsible\". This incident is often cited by Israel advocates who claim that the media favors the Palestinian side, because of reports which attributed the blast to the IDF prior to the conclusion of the IDF investigation.\n\nOn August 5, 2006 Charles Foster Johnson of Little Green Footballs accused Reuters of inappropriately manipulating images of destruction to Beirut caused by Israel during the Second Lebanon War. This accusation marked the first of many accusations against media outlets for inappropriate photo manipulation. Media outlets were also accused of incorrectly captioning photos and of staging photographs through the inappropriate use of props. These accusations, which initially appeared in the blogosphere, were amplified by Aish HaTorah through an online video entitled \"Photo Fraud in Lebanon\". In response to these allegations, Reuters toughened its photo editing policy and admitted to inappropriate photo manipulation on the part of Adnan Hajj, a freelance photographer whom Reuters subsequently fired. Additionally, BBC, \"The New York Times\", and the Associated Press recalled photos or corrected captions in response to some of the accusations. This journalistic scandal, dubbed \"Reutersgate\" by the blogosphere in reference to the Watergate scandal and dubbed \"fauxtography\" by Honest Reporting and others, is frequently cited by Israelis and by Israel advocates in order to demonstrate alleged anti-Israel bias, this time in the form of an outright forgery created by a biased local freelance photographer.\n\nOn October 28, 2006, \"The Independent\" published an article, by Robert Fisk, which speculated, based on information from the European Committee on Radiation Risk, that Israel may have used depleted uranium weapons during the 2006 Lebanon War. The article prompted criticism by HonestReporting for coming to conclusions prematurely, and resulted in an investigation by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). On November 8, 2006, UNEP concluded that Israel had not used any form of uranium-based weapons. Israelis and Israel advocates cite the article as an instance of \"shoddy journalism\", arising allegedly as a result of media sensationalism.\n\nOn 19 July 2008, Al Jazeera TV broadcast a program from Lebanon that covered the \"welcome-home\" festivities for Samir Kuntar, a Lebanese militant who had been imprisoned in Israel for murdering several people, including a four-year-old child, in a Palestine Liberation Front raid from Lebanon into Israel. In the program, the head of Al Jazeera's Beirut office, Ghassan bin Jiddo, praised Kuntar as a \"pan-Arab hero\" and organized a birthday party for him. In response, Israel's Government Press Office (GPO) threatened to boycott the satellite channel unless it apologized. A few days later an official letter was issued by Al Jazeera's director general, Wadah Khanfar, in which he admitted that the program violated the station's Code of Ethics and that he had ordered the channel's programming director to take steps to ensure that such an incident does not recur.\n\nA Gaza man falsely claimed that his five-month-old baby died on March 23, 2012, when the generator powering his respirator ran out of fuel, a result of the Egyptian blockade on Gaza and Egyptian cut-off of fuel to Gaza. The baby's death, which had been \"confirmed\" by a Gaza health official, would have been the first to be connected with the territory's energy shortage. The baby's father, Abdul-Halim Helou, said that his son Mohammed was born with a lymphatic disorder and needed removal of the fluids that accumulated in his respiratory system, and had only a few months to live. He said that they had erred in how much fuel was required and that if they had been \"living in a normal country with electricity\", his son's chances of living longer would have been better.\n\nHowever, the report was called into question when it emerged that the timing of the baby's death had been misrepresented, and appeared to be an attempt by Gaza's Hamas rulers to exploit the death to gain sympathy. The Associated Press later learned that news of Mohammed Helou's death had already appeared on March 4 in the local Arabic newspaper Al-Quds and that Hamas was now trying to recycle the story to capitalize on the family's tragedy. The Al-Quds article contained the same details as the later report, but with an earlier date. When confronted by the Associated Press, the family and Hamas official Bassem al-Qadri continued to insist that the baby had only recently died. The AP reporter Diaa Hadid tweeted, \"#Hamas misrepresented a story. Two Hamas officials misled us and so did the family.\"\n\nThe Associated Press then retracted the story, explaining that \"The report has been called into question after it was learned that a local newspaper carried news of the baby's death on March 4.\"\n\nAn Israeli government spokesman said he was not surprised by Hamas' attempt to \"hide the truth and manipulate the information that is allowed to get out of Gaza.\"\n\nHonest Reporting commented that \"when Palestinian lies and misinformation go unchecked, it's inevitable that dishonest propaganda tactics used against Israel will be employed against others.\" CAMERA stated that this was \"the latest example of disinformation about Gaza casualties.\"\n\nGaza is a coastal plain, bordering the Negev desert which witnesses flash floods during heavy rains as water runs across the surface of the impervious desert soil.\n\nDuring the 2013 winter storm in the Middle east Ma'an News Agency reported that Israel opened dams, leading to Gaza floods.\n\nDuring February 2015 storm, several news sources reported that Gaza had been flooded after Israel opened dams. However, AFP and Yahoo had later retracted their stories in February 2015, and COGAT stated: \"These claims, I don't know who started them, but they are completely false. There are no dams in the southern part of Israel so we couldn't open any dams because there aren't any. I don't know how these rumours got around.\"\n\nRazan Ashraf Abdul Qadir al-Najjar was a nurse/paramedic who was killed by the Israeli army while volunteering as a medic during the 2018 Gaza border protests. She was fatally shot in the chest by an Israeli soldier as she, reportedly with her arms raised to show she was unarmed, tried to help evacuate the wounded near Israel's border fence with Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli army released footage in which she purportedly admitted to participating in the protests as a human shield, supposedly at the request of Hamas. The video was later found to be a clip from an interview with a Lebanese television station that had been edited by the IDF to misleadingly take al-Najjar's comments out of context. In the actual, unedited video, she made no mention of Hamas, and called herself a \"rescuing human shield to protect and save the wounded at the front lines\", with everything following \"human shield\" trimmed out of the Israeli clip. The IDF was widely criticized for tampering with the video in order to chip away at her image.\n\nThis section discusses films with media coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict as its main topic. The films presented in this section appear in alphabetical order.\n\n\"Décryptage\" is a 2003 documentary written by Jacques Tarnero and directed by Philippe Bensoussan. The French film (with English subtitles) examines media coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict in French media, and claims that the media's presentation of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in France is consistently skewed against Israel and may be responsible for exacerbating anti-Semitism.\n\n\"Pallywood: According to Palestinian sources...\" is an 18-minute online documentary by Richard Landes. The film, with its title derived from the words Palestine and Hollywood, claims that the Western media uncritically accepts and reports the stories of freelance Palestinian videographers who record staged scenes, often involving faked or exaggerated injuries, in order to elicit sympathy and support.\n\n\"Peace, Propaganda, and the Promised Land\" is a 2004 documentary by Sut Jhally and Bathsheba Ratzkoff. The movie claims that the influence of pro-Israel media watchdog groups, such as CAMERA and Honest Reporting, leads to distorted and pro-Israel media reports. In its response to the movie, the pro-Israel JCRC criticizes the film for not discussing the influence of \"the numerous pro‐Palestinian media watchdog groups, including, ironically, FAIR (Fair and Accuracy in the Media, which describes itself as 'A National Media Watch Group'), whose spokesperson played a prominent role in the film\". According to the pro-Palestinian \"LiP Magazine\", the movie \"offers a great starting point for thinking about media misrepresentation of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and useful analysis of how language is used to manipulate public opinion,\" but is short on \"solid statistics and facts to back up some of its blanket statements\". A review in \"The New York Times\" by Ned Martel found that the film \"largely ignores Palestinian leadership, which has surely played a part in the conflict’s broken vows and broken hearts. And such a lack of dispassion weakens the one-sided film's bold and detailed argument\".\n\n\nFalse compromise refers to the claim, made by some Israeli advocates and by some Palestinian advocates, that their side of the conflict is morally right and the other side is morally wrong and, therefore, attempts to balance the presentation of both viewpoints wrongfully suggests that both sides are morally equivalent. In the words of journalist Bret Stephens, \"Moral clarity is a term that doesn't get much traction these days, least of all among journalists, who prefer 'objectivity' and 'balance.' Yet good journalism is more than about separating fact from opinion and being fair. Good journalism is about fine analysis and making distinctions, and this applies as much to moral distinctions as to any others. Because too many reporters today refuse to make moral distinctions, we are left with a journalism whose narrative and analytical failings have become ever more glaring\".\n\nStructural geographic bias refers to the claim, made by some Palestinian advocates, that the Western media favors Israel, allegedly as a result of Western reporters living in Israel.\n\nAdvocacy groups, governments and individuals use the internet, new media and social media to try to influence public perceptions of both sides in the Arab/Palestinian–Israeli conflict. \"Jerusalem Post\" writer Megan Jacobs has written \"War in the Middle East is being waged not only on the ground, but also in cyberspace.\" While Israeli and Palestinian advocacy websites promote their respective points of view, fierce debate over the Arab–Israeli conflict has embroiled social networking websites and applications with user-generated content, such as Facebook, Google Earth, Twitter and Wikipedia. According to an Associated Press article, Israelis and Palestinians make use of social media to promote \"rival narratives\" and draw attention to their own suffering to gain international sympathy and backing. However, \"distortions and mistakes are instantly magnified on a global scale.\"\n\nFacebook is a social networking website, which allows users to connect and interact with other people online, both directly by \"friending\" people and indirectly through the creation of groups. Because the website allows users to join networks organized by city, workplace, school, and region, Facebook has become embroiled in a number of regional conflicts. Facebook groups such as \"'Palestine' Is not a country... De-list it from Facebook as a country!\" and \"Israel is not a country! ... Delist it from Facebook as a country!\", among others reflecting the mutual non-recognition of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, have protested Facebook's listing of Israel and Palestine, respectively, as countries. This controversy became particularly heated when, in response to protests over Palestine being listed as a country, Facebook delisted it. The move infuriated Palestinian users and prompted the creation of numerous Facebook groups such as \"The Official Petition to get Palestine listed as a Country\", \"Against delisting Palestine from Facebook\", and \"If Palestine is removed from Facebook ... I'm closing my account\". Facebook, in response to user complaints, ultimately reinstated Palestine as a country network. A similar controversy took place regarding the status of Israeli settlements. When Israeli settlements were moved from being listed under the Israel network to the Palestine network, thousands of Israelis living in the area protested Facebook's decision. In response to the protest, Facebook has allowed users living in the area to select either Israel or Palestine as their home country.\n\nAnother controversy over Facebook regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict concerns Facebook groups which, against Facebook's terms of use, promote hatred and violence. According to former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, Facebook has been used to promote anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. A proliferation of Facebook groups praising the perpetrator of the Mercaz HaRav massacre in 2008 prompted the creation of the Facebook group \"FACEBOOK: Why do you support Anti-Semitism and Islamic Terrorism\", which claimed to have succeeded in deleting over 100 pro-Palestinian Facebook groups with violent content, by reporting the groups to Facebook. The group, which since evolved into the Jewish Internet Defense Force, took over the Facebook group \"Israel is not a country! Delist it from Facebook as a country\" when, according to the JIDF, Facebook stopped removing such groups. After taking over the group, the JIDF began to remove its more than 48,000 members and replaced the group's graphic with a picture of an IAF jet with the flag of Israel in the background. This sparked controversy.\n\nAccording to a McClatchy news article, those using social media, including even official spokesmen and public officials, have a habit of \"re-purposing\" older photographs and videos to illustrate current-day events. Few people check the accuracy of the material before spreading it to others. During the March 2012 Gaza–Israel clashes there were three such notable Twitter incidents. Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, tweeted a photo of an Israeli woman and her two children ducking a Gaza rocket describing it as \"when a rocket fired by terrorists from Gaza is about to hit their home.\" When it was proved the photo was from 2009 he said \"I never stated that the photo was current. It illustrates the fear that people in southern Israel live in.\" Avital Leibovich, the head of the foreign desk for Israel's military, sent a tweet from her official account of a video of rockets from Gaza being fired at Israel. It later was discovered the video had been taken in October 2011. When questioned she said her tweet was not misleading and \"Launching a rocket does not differ whether it happened in November, July or now\".\n\nLeibovich was one of a number of bloggers who criticized Khulood Badawi, an Information and Media Coordinator for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs who tweeted a picture of a Palestinian child covered in blood. She captioned it \"Another child killed by #Israel... Another father carrying his child to a grave in #Gaza.\" It was discovered the picture was published in 2006 and was of a Palestinian girl who had died in an accident and been brought to the hospital shortly after an Israeli air strike in Gaza. Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations Ron Prosor called for Badawi's dismissal, stating that she was \"directly engaged in spreading misinformation\". Humanitarian Coordinator and the Head of Office in Jerusalem later met with officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel to discuss these events. UN Under-Secretary General Valerie Amos wrote, \"It is regrettable that an OCHA staff member has posted information on her personal Twitter profile, which is both false and which reflects on issues that are related to her work.\"\n\nA few days later Badawi tweeted on her personal account \"Correction: I tweeted the photo believing it was from the last round of violence & it turned out to be from 2006 This is my personal account.\" Ma'an News Agency reported a week later that the hospital medical report on the dead girl read that she died \"due to falling from a high area during the Israeli strike on Gaza\". There are differing accounts of how the Israeli air strike, reported to be as little as 100 meters away, may have caused the accident.\n\nWikipedia is an online, collaboratively written encyclopedia. While editing conflicts occur frequently, one particular conflict, involving CAMERA and Electronic Intifada, made headlines in the \"Jerusalem Post\" and the \"International Herald Tribune\". When CAMERA encouraged individuals sympathetic to Israel to participate in editing Wikipedia in order to \"lead to more accuracy and fairness on Wikipedia\", Electronic Intifada accused CAMERA of \"orchestrating a secret, long-term campaign to infiltrate the popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia to rewrite Palestinian history, pass off crude propaganda as fact, and take over Wikipedia administrative structures to ensure these changes go either undetected or unchallenged.\" The accusations led to various administrative actions on Wikipedia—including the banning of certain editors. HonestReporting subsequently responded to the incident with its own article, entitled \"Exposed – Anti-Israeli Subversion on Wikipedia\" which complained of \"anti-Israel bias on Wikipedia\" and described Wikipedia's policy as a \"noble goal not always applied equally by Wikipedia users. CAMERA similarly responded to the incident with a letter entitled \"The failure of Wikipedia\", appearing in IHT, which described Wikipedia's Middle East articles as \"often-unreliable\". In a separate article entitled \"The Wild West of Wikipedia\", which appeared in \"The Jewish Chronicle\" and IMRA, Gilead Ini of CAMERA decried \"Wikipedia's often-skewed entries about the Middle East\", described Wikipedia's rules as \"shoddily enforced\", and wrote that, following the incident, \"many editors who hoped to ensure accuracy and balance ... are now banned\" while \"partisan editors ... continue to freely manipulate Wikipedia articles to their liking\".\n\nThe Yesha Council and Israel Sheli, launched a project to improve coverage of Zionist views on Wikipedia. The project organiser, Ayelet Shaked emphasized that the information has to be reliable and meet Wikipedia rules. \"The idea is not to make Wikipedia rightist but for it to include our point of view,\" said Naftali Bennett, the director of the Yesha Council. In this vein, the groups taught a course on how to edit Wikipedia. The Yesha Council also launched a new prize, \"Best Zionist Editor,\" to be awarded to the most productive editor on Israel-related topics.\n\nIn 2013, a number of news outlets, including Israeli newspaper \"Haaretz\" and France24, reported on an indefinite block of an editor who had concealed the fact that he was an employee of right-wing media group NGO Monitor.

{"id": "404013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=404013", "title": "National Historic Landmark", "text": "National Historic Landmark\n\nA National Historic Landmark (NHL) is a building, district, object, site, or structure that is officially recognized by the United States government for its outstanding historical significance. Of over 90,000 places listed on the country's National Register of Historic Places, only some 2,500 are recognized as National Historic Landmarks.\n\nA National Historic Landmark District may include contributing properties that are buildings, structures, sites or objects, and it may include non-contributing properties. Contributing properties may or may not also be separately listed.\n\nPrior to 1935, efforts to preserve cultural heritage of national importance were made by piecemeal efforts of the United States Congress. In 1935, Congress passed the Historic Sites Act, which authorized the Interior Secretary authority to formally record and organize historic properties, and to designate properties as having \"national historical significance\", and gave the National Park Service authority to administer historically significant federally owned properties. Over the following decades, surveys such as the Historic American Buildings Survey amassed information about culturally and architecturally significant properties in a program known as the Historic Sites Survey. Most of the designations made under this legislation became National Historic Sites, although the very first designation, made December 20, 1935, was for a National Memorial, the Gateway Arch National Park (then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial) in St. Louis, Missouri. The first National Historic Site designation was made for the Salem Maritime National Historic Site on March 17, 1938.\n\nIn 1960, the National Park Service took on the administration of the survey data gathered under this legislation, and the National Historic Landmark program began to take more formal shape. When the National Register of Historic Places was established in 1966, the National Historic Landmark program was encompassed within it, and rules and procedures for inclusion and designation were formalized. Because listings (either on the National Register, or as an NHL) often triggered local preservation laws, legislation in 1980 amended the listing procedures to require owner agreement to the designations.\n\nOn October 9, 1960, 92 properties were announced as designated NHLs by Secretary of the Interior Fred A. Seaton. The first of these was a political nomination: the Sergeant Floyd Monument in Sioux City, Iowa was officially designated on June 30 of that year, but for various reasons, the public announcement of the first several NHLs was delayed.\n\nNHLs are designated by the United States Secretary of the Interior because they are:\n\nMore than 2,500 NHLs have been designated. Most, but not all, are in the United States.\n\nThere are NHLs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Three states (Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York) account for nearly 25 percent of the nation's NHLs. Three cities within these states (Boston, Philadelphia, and New York City) all separately have more NHLs than 40 of the 50 states. In fact, New York City alone has more NHLs than all but five states: Virginia, California, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York (the latter of which has the most NHLs of all 50 states). There are 74 NHLs in the District of Columbia.\n\nSome NHLs are in U.S. commonwealths and territories, associated states, and foreign states. There are 15 in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and other U.S. commonwealths and territories; five in U.S.-associated states such as Micronesia; and one in Morocco.\n\nOver 100 ships or shipwrecks have been designated as NHLs.\n\nAbout half of the National Historic Landmarks are privately owned. The National Historic Landmarks Program relies on suggestions for new designations from the National Park Service, which also assists in maintaining the landmarks. A friends' group of owners and managers, the National Historic Landmark Stewards Association, works to preserve, protect and promote National Historic Landmarks.\n\nIf not already listed on the National Register of Historic Places, an NHL is automatically added to the Register upon designation. About three percent of Register listings are NHLs.\n\n\n"}

He claimed to have been the commander of Alexander's fleet but was actually only a helmsman; Arrian and Nearchus often criticize him for this. When he returned home, he wrote a history of Alexander's campaigns. He is frequently cited by later authors, who also criticize him for his inaccuracies.\n\nHe was a native of Astypalaia, and it was probably to this island origin that he owed the nautical skills which would prove so advantageous to him. He was a disciple of Diogenes of Sinope, the Cynic philosopher. Diogenes Laërtius also calls him \"Onesicritus of Aegina\", and says that he came to Athens because his two adult sons, Androsthenes and Philiscus, were attracted to the philosophy of Diogenes the Cynic, whence Onesicritus also became an ardent disciple. If so, he must have been already advanced in years when he joined the expedition of Alexander.\n\nWe have no account of the circumstances which led him to accompany Alexander into Asia, nor in what capacity he attended on the conqueror; but during the expedition into India he was sent by the king to hold a conference with the Indian philosophers or Gymnosophists, the details of which have been transmitted to us from his own account of the interview. It was Onesicritus, whom Alexander first sent to summon Dandamis to his court. When later Onesicritus returned empty-handed with the reply of Dandamis, the King went to forest to visit Dandamis. When Alexander constructed his fleet on the Hydaspes, he appointed Onesicritus to the important position of pilot of the king's ship, or chief pilot of the fleet (). Onesicritus held this position not only during the descent of the Indus, but throughout the long and perilous voyage from the river to the Persian gulf. Alexander was so satisfied with his work that, on his arrival at Susa, Onesicritus was rewarded with a crown of gold, at the same time as Nearchus. Yet Arrian blames him for lack of judgment, and on one occasion expressly ascribes the safety of the fleet to the firmness of Nearchus in overruling his advice. We know nothing of his subsequent fortunes; but from an anecdote related by Plutarch it seems probable that he attached himself to Lysimachus, and it was perhaps at the court of that monarch that he composed his historical work, though, on the other hand, a passage of Lucian might suggest that this was begun during the lifetime of Alexander himself.\n\nWe learn from Diogenes Laërtius that Onesicritus wrote a work about Alexander called \"How Alexander was Educated\" (), imitating the style of Xenophon, though he fell short of him as a copy does of the original. It is most frequently cited in regard to the campaigns of Alexander in Asia, and for descriptions of the countries that he visited. Though an eye-witness of much that he described, it appears that he intermixed many fables and falsehoods with his narrative, so that he early fell into discredit as an authority. Strabo is especially severe upon him. Plutarch cites him as one of those who related the fable of the visit of the Amazons to Alexander, for which he was justly ridiculed by Lysimachus, and Arrian accuses him of falsely representing himself as the commander of the fleet, when he was in truth only the pilot. Aulus Gellius even associates him with Aristeas of Proconnesus, and other purely fabulous writers. But it is clear that these censures are overcharged; and though some of the statements cited from him are certainly gross exaggerations, his work appears to have contained much valuable information concerning the remote countries for the first time laid open by the expedition of Alexander. In particular he was the first author that mentioned the island of Taprobane, which is known today as Sri Lanka.\n\nAttribution\n"}
{"id": "11007002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11007002", "title": "Oral history preservation", "text": "Oral history preservation\n\nOral history preservation is the field that deals with the care and upkeep of oral history materials, whatever format they may be in. Oral history is a method of historical documentation, using interviews with living survivors of the time being investigated. Oral history often touches on topics scarcely touched on by written documents, and by doing so, fills in the gaps of records that make up early historical documents.\n\nThe earliest method of collecting oral history was through memory. (see: oral tradition)\nWith the loss of elders who were willing to preserve and pass along these histories, cultural memories began to vanish.\n\nWith the advent of the written word, it became possible for cultures to preserve their history without the memory of a select few. Spoken word was transcribed, and the eyewitness accounts of those who lived through both significant and everyday events were able to be saved for future generations to study.\n\nThis method of historical preservation was augmented with the invention of different methods to record sound. Spoken word can now be recorded on audio or video tape, or through newer digital methods.\n\nWhile new media allows for richer histories to be saved, it also comes with greater issues for preservationists, one such issue being that of copyright and the ethical concerns that come along with it. For all intents and purposes, copyright does not exist in oral testimonies, at least not as clearly as it does in written documents. It is hard to decide who holds the rights to the materials and how they should be handled. There are ways to combat copyright and ethical concerns and restrictions, however. One such way is through a letter of intent. Users sign this document before listening to an oral history recording in order to demonstrate that they understand and have agreed to the usage restrictions put in place by the institution.\n\nEarly methods of recording sound included phonograph cylinders (a stylus would draw wax grooves on the outside of a cylinder), gramophone records (grooves on the flat side of a disk) and magnetic recordings.\n\nWhile reel-to-reel audio tape recordings are still used, video recordings have become standard. This allows the researcher to take body language and facial expressions (both important means of communication in themselves) into account. There is also an emerging trend to use the telephone to make audio journals when distance prevents face-to-face contact.\n\nIn order to ensure the preservation of oral histories it is important that all work is properly transcribed and stored on reliable media. It is important to preserve oral histories in modern digital format to ensure longevity and usability. The simplest and easiest way to do this for audio histories is to purchase a \"personal MP3 player\" that has recording capabilities, and record directly to the flash chip in the player. These are very inexpensive and can hold many hours of interviews. The files should then be uploaded to a central computer server and copies can be burned to optical media, or copied to USB flash drives owned by the researchers, scholars and students working with the material.\n\nRecordable compact discs are commonly used over magnetic tape for the preservation of oral histories over a long period of time. Compact Cassette tapes and Videotape were popular but have been almost completely replaced by optical media such as CD-R and DVD media. CD-R is a successful technology that has proven its reliability over period of time, but it should be viewed with caution for long term storage as the media is easily scratched. The safest way is to make a \"gold master\" CD that is not ever checked out for use from the library, and duplicate copies of this for use by people wishing to access it. The Folk Heritage Collections, at the Library of Congress, set a standard for 24 bits when digitizing music. This creates \"superb\" sound and has a high level of detail (Danielson, 2001). The Library of Congress uses CD-R as one of its storage methods. The Library of Congress has a higher budget than many university or archives, therefore they are able to store materials in multiple places. But, the Library of Congress has stated that they do believe storing sound on CD-R is a safe storage method (Danielson, 2001). One can assume if it is considered safe by the Library of Congress it is a relatively safe method of preservation.\n\nA huge challenge of oral history preservation today is the battle with digital obsolescence. There is an obvious link between oral history preservation and digital preservation. Oral histories are often recorded on an assortment of tapes which are ultimately transferred onto computerized, or digitized, formats in order to facilitate their longevity. These digitized formats then have to be preserved, along with their corresponding metadata, just as any other digital objects are. Technological advances are happening everyday and it is difficult to keep up with these changes. Emulation and migration are two ways in which formats can be changed in order to be of use for longer. Emulation focuses on designing hardware and software that will imitate the old system so that it can accept the old files while migration focuses on fitting preserved data into a smaller number of formats that can still encode the complexities of the structure and form of the original format.\n\nWith the recent cost decreases in hard disk drives, oral archivists are considering moving many of their popular holdings to permanent storage in a server farm. For example, a single terabyte disk drive costing under $100 USD can hold 1,900 hours of uncompressed audio. A CD-R by contrast can only hold 76 minutes of uncompressed audio. Disk drive array cards such as the 3ware 9650SE can field 8TB of redundantly protected data in a standard PC case. One of the big advantages of doing this is that as the servers age and are retired, the files can simply be copied to newer, larger replacement servers making hardware obsolescense a thing of the past.\n\nDue to the growing importance of oral histories the United States, as well as the international community, have increased funding to produce more oral histories, preserve oral history collections, and train oral historians. There are a growing number of oral history programs and classes in college and university campus across America. Although Indiana University does not offer academic degrees in oral history The Center for the Study of History and Memory offers students the opportunity to take classes on the topic. Some of the major universities that offer classes or degrees in oral history are Columbia University, University of Kentucky, and University of California Los Angeles. Many international universities and organizations are also enhancing their programs. The United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, have all established oral history associations and offer educational classes on the subject. These programs are aimed at educating future oral historians on key issues relating to oral history, such as preservation. This is a highly debated subject matter, due to increasing technology and funding.\n\nThe basic preservation rule for oral histories is that the repository must make three copies each of the oral history, of the transcript, and of all accompanying paperwork (summaries and copyright statements).\n\n\nTranscripts of oral histories can facilitate their dissemination to the public. There are a few basic rules for paper (transcript) preservation of your oral history collection:\n\n\nThere are a few basic rules for magnetic recording preservation of your oral history collection:\n\n\nThere are many different digital preservation strategies, but no one strategy has been agreed upon as appropriate for all data types or institutions.\n\nOral history materials are often stored in archival repositories that facilitate their preservation and longevity. Archival repositories are kept at the correct temperature to store oral history materials and trained professionals are there to ensure that the formats of the materials are kept up to date. Archivists, Preservationists and Conservators are in a unique position to appraise the shortcomings of existing archival records and to subsequently know what value can be made by oral history materials.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24261", "title": "Pomerania", "text": "Pomerania\n\nPomerania (; German, Low German and North Germanic languages: \"Pommern\"; Kashubian: \"Pòmòrskô\") is a historical region on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in Central Europe, split between Germany and Poland.\n\nThe name derives from the Slavic \"po more\", meaning \"by the sea\" or \"on the sea\". Pomerania stretches roughly from the Recknitz and Trebel rivers in the west to the Vistula river in the east.\n\nThe largest Pomeranian islands are Rügen, Usedom/Uznam and Wolin. The largest Pomeranian city is Gdańsk, or, when using a narrower definition of the region, Szczecin. Outside its urban areas, Pomerania is characterized by farmland, dotted with numerous lakes, forests, and towns. The region was strongly affected by post–World War I and II border and population shifts, with most of its pre-war inhabitants leaving or being expelled after 1945.\n\nPomerania is the area along the Bay of Pomerania of the Baltic Sea between the rivers Recknitz and Trebel in the west and Vistula in the east. It formerly reached perhaps as far south as the Noteć river, but since the 13th century its southern boundary has been placed further north.\n\nMost of the region is coastal lowland, being part of the Central European Plain, but its southern, hilly parts belong to the Baltic Ridge, a belt of terminal moraines formed during the Pleistocene. Within this ridge, a chain of moraine-dammed lakes constitutes the Pomeranian Lake District. The soil is generally rather poor, sometimes sandy or marshy.\n\nThe western coastline is jagged, with many peninsulas (such as Darß–Zingst) and islands (including Rügen, Usedom, and Wolin) enclosing numerous bays (Bodden) and lagoons (the biggest being the Lagoon of Szczecin).\n\nThe eastern coastline is smooth. Łebsko and several other lakes were formerly bays, but have been cut off from the sea. The easternmost coastline along the Gdańsk Bay (with the Bay of Puck) and Vistula Lagoon, has the Hel Peninsula and the Vistula peninsula jutting out into the Baltic.\n\nThe Pomeranian region has the following administrative divisions:\n\n\nThe bulk of Farther Pomerania is included within the modern West Pomeranian Voivodeship, but its easternmost parts (the Słupsk area) now constitute the northwest of Pomeranian Voivodeship. Farther Pomerania in turn comprises several other historical subregions, most notably the Principality of Cammin, the County of Naugard, the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp, and also the Lauenburg and Bütow Land (the last, however, is sometimes regarded as a part of Pomerelia or Kashubia).\n\nParts of Pomerania and surrounding regions have constituted a euroregion since 1995. The Pomerania euroregion comprises Hither Pomerania and Uckermark in Germany, West Pomerania in Poland, and Scania in Sweden.\n\n\"Pomerania\" and its cognates in other languages are derived from Old Slavic \"po\", meaning \"by/next to/along\", and \"more\", meaning \"sea\", thus \"Pomerania\" literally means \"seacoast\" or \"land by the sea\", referring to its proximity to the Baltic Sea.\n\nPomerania was first mentioned in an imperial document of 1046, referring to a \"Zemuzil dux Bomeranorum\" (Zemuzil, Duke of the Pomeranians). Pomerania is mentioned repeatedly in the chronicles of Adam of Bremen (c. 1070) and Gallus Anonymous (ca. 1113).\n\nThe term \"West Pomerania\" is ambiguous, since it may refer to either Hither Pomerania (in historical and German usage) or to the West Pomeranian Voivodeship (in common Polish usage).\n\nThe term \"East Pomerania\" may similarly carry different meanings, referring either to Farther Pomerania (in historical and German usage), or to Pomerelia or the Pomeranian Voivodeship (in Polish usage).\n\nSettlement in the area called Pomerania for the last 1,000 years started by the end of the Vistula Glacial Stage, some 13,000 years ago. Archeological traces have been found of various cultures during the Stone and Bronze Age, Baltic peoples, Germanic peoples and Veneti during the Iron Age and, in the Dark Ages, Slavic tribes and Vikings. Starting in the 10th century, early Polish dukes on several occasions subdued parts of the region from the southeast, while the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark augmented their territory from the west and north.\n\nIn the 12th century, narrow Pomerania became Christian under saint Otto of Bamberg (\"the Apostle of the Pomeranians\"); at the same time Pomerelia became a part of diocese of Włocławek. Since then, the Griffin Duchy of Pomerania stayed with the Holy Roman Empire and the Principality of Rugia with Denmark, while Pomerelia, under the ruling of Samborides, was a part of Poland. Pomerania, during its alliance in the Holy Roman Empire, shared borders with Slavic state Oldenburg, as well as Poland and Brandenburg. The Teutonic Knights succeeded in integrating Pomerelia into their monastic state in the early 14th century. Meanwhile, the Ostsiedlung started to turn Slavic narrow Pomerania into an increasingly German-settled area; the remaining Wends and Polish people, often known as Kashubians, continued to settle within Pomerelia. In 1325 the line of the princes of Rügen died out, and the principality was inherited by the Griffins. In 1466, with the Teutonic Order's defeat, Pomerelia became again subject to the Polish Crown as a part of Royal Prussia. While the German population in the Duchy of Pomerania adopted the Protestant reformation in 1534, the Polish (along with Kashubian) population remained with the Roman Catholic Church. The Thirty Years' War severely ravaged and depopulated narrow Pomerania; few years later this same happened to Pomerelia (\"the Deluge\"). With the extinction of the Griffin house during the same period, the Duchy of Pomerania was divided between the Swedish Empire and Brandenburg-Prussia in 1648, while Pomerelia remained in with the Polish Crown.\n\nPrussia gained the southern parts of Swedish Pomerania in 1720, invaded and annexed Pomerelia from Poland in 1772, and gained the remainder of Swedish Pomerania in 1815, after the Napoleonic Wars. The former Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania and the former Swedish parts were reorganized into the Prussian Province of Pomerania, while Pomerelia was made part of the Province of West Prussia. With Prussia, both provinces joined the newly constituted German Empire in 1871. Under the German rule the Polish minority suffered discrimination and oppressive measures aimed at eradicating its culture. Following the empire's defeat in World War I, however, Pomorze Gdańskie/Pomerelia was returned to the rebuilt Polish state as part of the so-called Polish Corridor), while German-majority Gdansk/Danzig was transformed into the independent Free City of Danzig. Germany's Province of Pomerania was expanded in 1938 to include northern parts of the former Province of Posen–West Prussia, and in late 1939 the annexed Pomorze Gdańskie/Polish Corridor became part of the wartime Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. The Nazis deported the Pomeranian Jews to a reservation near Lublin and, in Pomerelia. The Polish population suffered heavily during the Nazi oppression; more than 40,000 died in executions, death camps, prisons and forced labour, primarily those who were teachers, businessmen, priests, politicians, former army officers, and civil servants. Thousands of Poles and Kashubians suffered deportation, their homes taken over by the German military and civil servants, as well as some Baltic Germans resettled there between 1940-1943.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the German–Polish border was shifted west to the Oder–Neisse line, and all of Pomerania was under Soviet military control. The German citizens of the former eastern territories of Germany and Poles of German ethnicity from Pomerelia were expelled, and the area was resettled primarily with Poles of Polish ethnicity, (some themselves expellees from former eastern Poland) and some Poles of Ukrainian ethnicity (resettled under Operation Vistula) and few Polish Jews. Most of Hither or Western Pomerania (\"Vorpommern\") remained in Germany, and at first about 500,000 fled and expelled Farther Pomeranians found refuge there, later many moved on to other German regions and abroad. Today German Hither Pomerania forms the eastern part of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, while the Polish part is divided between the West Pomeranian and Pomeranian voivodeships, with their capitals in Szczecin and Gdańsk. During the 1980s, the Solidarity and \"Die Wende\" (\"the change\") movements overthrew the Communist regimes implemented during the post-war era; since then, Pomerania is democratically governed.\n\nPomerania still lives in the country of Brazil in a colony where the language is still spoken. The arrival of Pomerania immigrants with Germans and Italians helped form the state of Espírito Santo since the early 1930s, from Gustavo Barreto. Their importance and respect are one of the cultural signatures of the area. Brazilian city Pomerode (state os Santa Catarina) was founded by Pomeranian Germans in 1861 and is considered the most typically German of all German towns of southern Brazil.\n\nWestern Pomerania is inhabited by German Pomeranians. In the eastern parts, Poles are the dominating ethnic group since the territorial changes of Poland after World War II, and the resulting Polonization. Kashubians, descendants of the medieval Slavic Pomeranians, are numerous in rural Pomerelia.\n\nGerman Hither Pomerania had a population of about 470,000 in 2012 (districts of Vorpommern-Rügen and Vorpommern-Greifswald combined) - while the Polish districts of the region had a population of about 520,000 in 2012 (cities of Szczecin, Świnoujście and Police County combined). So overall, about 1 million people live in the historical region of Hither Pomerania today, while the Szczecin metropolitan area reaches even further.\n\nCities in the historical region of Pomerania (with population figures for 2012):\n\nOther cities in the Pomeranian and Kuyavian-Pomeranian voivodeships:\nIn the German part of Pomerania, Standard German and the East Low German Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch\nand Central Pomeranian dialects are spoken, though Standard German dominates. Polish is the dominating language in the Polish part; Kashubian dialects are also spoken by the Kashubians in Pomerelia.\n\nEast Pomeranian, the East Low German dialect of Farther Pomerania and western Pomerelia, Low Prussian, the East Low German dialect of eastern Pomerelia, and Standard German were dominating in Pomerania east of the Oder-Neisse line before most of its speakers were expelled after World War II. Slovincian was spoken at the Farther Pomeranian–Pomerelian frontier, but is now extinct.\n\nKashubian and East Low German are also spoken by the descendants of émigrées, most notably in the Americas (e.g. Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Canada).\n\n\"For typical food and beverages of the region, see Pomeranian cuisine.\"\n\nThe Pomeranian State Museum in Greifswald, dedicated to the history of Pomerania, has a variety of archeological findings and artefacts from the different periods covered in this article. At least 50 museums in Poland cover history of Pomerania, the most important of them The National Museum in Gdańsk, Central Pomerania Museum in Słupsk, Darłowo Museum, Koszalin Museum, National Museum in Szczecin.\n\nAgriculture primarily consists of raising livestock, forestry, fishery and the cultivation of cereals, sugar beets, and potatoes. Industrial food processing is increasingly relevant in the region. Since the late 19th century, tourism has become an important sector of the economy, primarily in the numerous seaside resorts along the coast. Key producing industries are shipyards, mechanical engineering facilities (i.a. renewable energy components), sugar refineries, paper and wood fabricators. Service industries today are an important economical factor in Pomerania, most notably with logistics, information technology, life sciences/biotechnology/health care and other high tech branches often clustering around research facilities of the Pomeranian universities.\n\n\n\n"}

This, however, did not prevent him from acting, in 1189, as a justice of the forests in the shires of Yorkshire, Cumberland and Northumberland.\n\nDuring this time, Hoveden is believed to have been working on his \"Gesta Henrici II et Gesta Regis Ricardi\". This chronicle was formerly ascribed to Benedict of Peterborough, who had the manuscript copied for his library. The \"Gesta Regis Henrici II & Gesta Regis Ricardi\" is the work of a well-informed man, connected with the court and inclined to take the side of Henry II. He confines himself to the external history of events, and his tone is strictly impersonal. He incorporates some official documents, and in many places obviously derives his information from others which he does not quote. There is a break in his work at the year 1177, where the earliest manuscript ends. The work begins at Christmas 1169, and concludes in 1192; it is thus in form a fragment, covering portions of the reign of Henry II and Richard I.\n\nHoveden went on the Third Crusade with Richard I of England, joining him in Marseille in August 1190. He left for Europe in August 1191, in the entourage of Philip II of France. On his return, about the year 1192 he began to compile his \"Chronica\", a general history of England from 732 to his own time. Up to the year 1192 his narrative adds little to our knowledge. For the period 732–1148 he chiefly drew upon an extant, but unpublished chronicle, the \"Historia Saxonum sive Anglorum post obitum Bedae\" (British Library Royal MS 13 A VI), which was composed about 1150. From 1148 to 1170 he used the \"Melrose Chronicle\" (edited for the Bannatyne Club in 1835 by Joseph Stevenson) and a collection of letters bearing upon the Thomas Becket controversy. From 1170 to 1192 he drew upon his own earlier \"Gesta Regis Henrici II\" and \"Gesta Regis Ricardi\", revising the text and inserting some additional documents. From 1192, the \"Chronica\" is an independent and copious authority.\n\nHoveden is sedulously impersonal, and makes no pretense to literary style, quotes documents in full and adheres to the annalistic method. His chronology is tolerably exact, but there are mistakes enough to prove that he recorded events at a certain distance of time. Both on foreign affairs and on questions of domestic policy he is unusually well informed. His practical experience as an administrator and his official connections stood him in good stead. He is particularly useful on points of constitutional history. His work breaks off abruptly in 1201, though he certainly intended to carry it further. Probably his death should be placed in that year.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28981", "title": "Society for Creative Anachronism", "text": "Society for Creative Anachronism\n\nThe Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) is an international living history group with the aim of studying and recreating mainly Medieval European cultures and their histories before the 17th century. A quip often used within the SCA describes it as a group devoted to the Middle Ages \"as they ought to have been\", choosing to \"selectively recreate the culture, choosing elements of the culture that interest and attract us\". Founded in 1966, the non-profit educational corporation has over 30,000 paid members with about 60,000 total participants in the society (including members and non-member participants).\n\nThe SCA's roots can be traced to a backyard party of a UC Berkeley medieval studies graduate, the author Diana Paxson, in Berkeley, California, on May Day in 1966. The party began with a \"Grand Tournament\" in which the participants wore helmets, fencing masks, and usually some semblance of a costume, and sparred with each other using weapons such as plywood swords, padded maces, and fencing foils. It ended with a parade down Telegraph Avenue with everyone singing \"Greensleeves\". It was styled as a \"protest against the 20th century\". The SCA still measures dates within the society from the date of that party, calling the system \"Anno Societatis\" (Latin for \"in the Year of the Society\"). For example, 2009 May 1 to 2010 April 30 was A.S. XLIV (44). The name Berkeley Society for Creative Anachronism was coined by science fiction author Marion Zimmer Bradley, an early participant, when the nascent group needed an official name in order to reserve a park for a tournament. \"Berkeley\" was dropped as the group expanded.\n\nThree more co-founders are mentioned by Douglas Martin in the New York Times Obituaries of August 3, 2001 (p.A23, \"Poul Anderson, Science Fiction Novelist, Dies at 74\"): \"[Anderson and Karen Kruse] moved to San Francisco and were married...They and their daughter, Astrid...founded the Society for Creative Anachronism, which...has spread nationwide.\"\nIn 1968, Bradley moved to Staten Island, New York and founded the Kingdom of the East, holding a tournament that summer to determine the first Eastern King of the SCA. That September, a tournament was held at the 26th World Science Fiction Convention, which was in Berkeley that year. The SCA had produced a book for the convention called \"A Handbook for the Current Middle Ages\", which was a how-to book for people wanting to start their own SCA chapters. Convention goers purchased the book and the idea spread. Soon, other local chapters began to form. In October 1968, the SCA was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation in California. By the end of 1969, the SCA's three original kingdoms had been established: West Kingdom, East, and Middle. All SCA kingdoms trace their roots to these original three. The number of SCA kingdoms has continued to grow by the expansion and division of existing kingdoms; for example, the kingdoms now called the Outlands, Artemisia, Ansteorra, Gleann Abhann, Meridies, and Trimaris all are made up of lands originally belonging to the fourth kingdom, Atenveldt, which began as a branch of the West Kingdom.\n\nIn 2012, SCA agreed to pay $1.3 million to settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of 11 victims of child sexual abuse. The abuse was committed in Pennsylvania at the private residence of Ben Schragger, who pleaded guilty to criminal charges in 2004. Schragger was a member of SCA at the time of the abuse. His membership was suspended on his arrest and permanently revoked after his plea. The lawsuit contended that the SCA had not conducted a background check on Schragger, though at the time the organization did not perform background checks in general and there is no legal requirement to do so.\n\nThe SCA engages in a broad range of activities, including SCA armoured combat, SCA fencing, archery, equestrian activities, feasting, medieval dance and recreating medieval arts and sciences, including a broad range of crafts as well as medieval music and theatre. Other activities include the study and practice of heraldry and scribal arts (calligraphy and illumination). Members are afforded opportunities to register a medieval personal name and coat of arms (often colloquially called a \"device\" in SCA parlance). SCA scribes produce illuminated scrolls to be given by SCA royalty as awards for various achievements.\n\nMost local groups in the SCA hold weekly fighter practices, and many also hold regular archery practices, dance practices, A&S (Arts & Science) nights and other regular gatherings. Some kingdoms and regions also have occasional war practices, where fighters practice formations and group tactics in preparation for large scale \"war\" events.\n\nThe research and approach by members of the SCA toward the recreation of history has led to new discoveries about medieval life.\n\nSome local groups participate in nearby Renaissance fairs, though the main focus of activity is organized through the SCA's own events. Each kingdom in the SCA runs its own schedule of events which are announced in the kingdom newsletter (and usually posted on the kingdom web site), but some of the largest SCA-sanctioned events, called \"wars\", attract members from many kingdoms. Pennsic War, fought annually between the East Kingdom and Middle Kingdom, is the biggest event in the SCA. The Estrella War has been held for over thirty years, mainly between two large regional SCA groups: the Kingdom of Atenveldt and the Kingdom of the Outlands. Most Estrella wars are held near Phoenix Arizona in late February and last around 7–9 days. Several thousand people attend each year, some from as far as Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, and Australia. Other annual SCA wars include Gulf Wars in Gleann Abhann (formerly Meridies), Great Western War in Caid, War of the Lillies in Calontir and others. Other annual or semi-annual Kingdom-level events held analogously by most or all SCA kingdoms include Crown Tournament, Coronation, Kingdom Arts and Sciences competition and Queen's Prize. Additionally, most baronies in the SCA have their own traditional annual events such as Baronial Arts and Sciences competition, a championship tournament, and often a Yule or Twelfth Night feast. Various SCA groups also sometimes host collegia or symposia, where members gather for a raft of classes on various medieval arts and sciences and other SCA-related topics.\n\nThe minimum standard for attendance at an SCA event is \"an attempt at pre-17th century clothing\", and there is a general goal of maintaining a historical atmosphere. However, SCA members will use modern elements when necessary for personal comfort, medical needs, or to promote safety (e.g. wearing prescription eye-wear, using rattan for swords or shear thickening substances for padding). Unlike some other living history groups, most SCA gatherings do not reenact a specific time or place in history, leaving members free to dress as any culture within the SCA's time period.\n\nThe SCA produces two quarterly publications, \"The Compleat Anachronist\" and \"Tournaments Illuminated\", and each kingdom publishes a monthly newsletter.\n\n\"The Compleat Anachronist\" is a quarterly monographic series, each issue focused on a specific topic related to the period of circa 600–1600 in European history. Issues are written by SCA members and have covered a wide range of topics.\n\n\"Tournaments Illuminated\" is a quarterly magazine, each issue covering a range of topics and including several features such as news, a humor column, book reviews, war reports and various articles on SCA-related topics of interest.\n\nThe SCA is incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation in California, with its current headquarters in the city of Milpitas. It is headed by a board of directors, each of whom is nominated by the membership of the SCA, selected by sitting directors, and elected to serve for 3.5 years. Each director serves as an ombudsman for various kingdoms and society officers. The BoD, as it is called, is responsible for handling the corporate affairs of the SCA and is also in charge of certain disciplinary actions, such as revoking the membership status of participants who have broken Corpora regulations or modern law while participating in SCA activities.\nBecause the SCA now has groups all over the world, it has also been incorporated in other countries, e.g. SCAA in Australia and SCANZ in New Zealand. These affiliated bodies work with the US board of directors with regards to societal issues, but make all decisions affected by local law independently of the US parent body. Although they agree to work in unity with the US SCA board of directors, they are autonomous and are not bound by any ruling of the US body.\n\nThe SCA is divided into administrative regions which it calls \"kingdoms\". Smaller branches within those kingdoms include \"Principalities\", \"Regions\", \"Baronies\", and \"Provinces\", and local chapters are known as \"Cantons\", \"Ridings\", \"Shires\", \"Colleges\", \"Strongholds\", and \"Ports\". Kingdoms, Principalities, and Baronies have ceremonial rulers who preside over activities and issue awards to individuals and groups. Colleges, Strongholds, and Ports are local chapters (like a shire) that are associated with an institution, such as a school, military base, or even a military ship at sea.\n\nAll SCA branches are organized in descending order as follows:\n\n\nGroups are active all over the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand, with scattered groups elsewhere, including China, Panama and Thailand. At one time there was even a group on the aircraft carrier USS \"Nimitz\", known as the \"Shire of Curragh Mor\" (anglicized Irish for \"Big Boat\"), and the shire's arms played on the \"Nimitz's\" ship's badge. There is also an active chapter in South Korea, the Stronghold of Warrior's Gate, with a mix of active duty military personnel from the several services and military-connected civilians. There are also non-territorial, usually called \"households\", which are not part of the Society's formal organization, the largest of which is the Mongol Empire-themed Great Dark Horde.\n\nThe twenty SCA Kingdoms and the geographic areas they cover are (in order of founding)\n\n\nThe Society as a whole, each kingdom, and each local group within a kingdom, all have a standard group of officers with titles loosely based on medieval equivalents.\n\nMembers of the SCA study and take part in a variety of activities, including combat and chivalry, archery, heraldry, equestrian activities, costuming, cooking, metalwork, woodworking, leathercrafting, music, dance, calligraphy, fiber arts, and others as practiced during the member's time period.\n\nTo aid historical recreation, participants in the SCA create historically plausible characters known individually as \"personae\". To new members, a persona can simply be a costume and a name used for weekend events, while other members may study and create an elaborate personal history. The goal of a well-crafted persona is a historically accurate person who might have lived in a particular historical time and place. The SCA has onomastic students who assist members in creating an appropriate persona name. The SCA rules state that: \"We allow elements and patterns for personal names from beyond Europe, but we require them to be from cultures that were known to medieval and Renaissance Europeans or whose members might reasonably have traveled to Europe\". So, while less common, there are members with Saracen, Chinese, Japanese or Native American personas.\n\nHowever, claiming to be a specific historical individual, especially a very familiar one (e.g. Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Henry Plantagenet, Queen Elizabeth I), is not permitted. Likewise, one is not allowed to claim the \"persona\" of a fellow SCA member, alive or dead. Nor is one allowed to take on the persona of a sufficiently familiar fictional character (e.g. Robin of Locksley/Robin Hood).\n\nA major dimension to the SCA is its internal system of Heraldry. Any member of the society may apply to register a name and device for their persona, which are checked by the heralds for uniqueness and period authenticity, before being blazoned and recorded in the society's Armorial. The system has evolved since the formation of the society; and now has three Sovereigns of Arms, with \"Principal Heralds\" for each Kingdom, who oversee deputy officers for matters such as heraldic education and processing registrations, and local officers (generally one for each local chapter) who assist the local participants. In addition to design of arms, heralds in the Society also provide services such as voice heraldry (similar to a master of ceremonies) at tournaments and official functions, and organizing tournament brackets or \"lists.\"\n\nThe SCA has ceremonial rulers chosen by winning tournaments (Kings/Queens, Princes/Princesses) in SCA armoured combat. Barons and Baronesses are appointed by Royalty, although some baronies hold elections or competitions to choose their preferred Baron and/or Baroness. One of the primary functions of state for reigning monarchs is to recognize participant achievement through awards. Most awards denote excellence in a specific pursuit such as local service, arts and sciences, and combat. Some awards change the precedence and title of the recipient, giving him or her the privilege of being known as \"Lord\"/\"Lady\", \"Baron\", \"Duchess\", \"Master\", and so forth. High level awards are often given with the consultation of the other people who have received the award, such as peerages and consulting orders. The Crown has some authority over other matters relating to leadership, but the extent of this varies from kingdom to kingdom.\n\nEach SCA kingdom is \"ruled\" by a king and queen chosen by winning a Crown Tournament in armored combat. Corpora require this to be held as a \"properly constituted armored combat\" tournament. The winner of the Crown Tournament and his/her Consort are styled \"Crown Prince and Princess\" and serve an advisory period (three to six months, depending upon the scheduling of the Crown Tournament) under the current King and Queen prior to acceding to the throne and ruling in their turn. \n\nThis selection method is not based on how actual medieval monarchs were chosen, as there is no record of one being selected by Tournament combat in this manner. There are, however, literary and historical bases for the custom, most famously the tournament in Sir Walter Scott's \"Ivanhoe\". In the Middle Ages, there were a number of different \"mock king\" games, some of which involved some form of combat, such as King of the Mountain or the King of Archers. In the 17th century the Cotswold Games were developed, the winner of which was declared to be \"king\". Also, the medieval sagas contain accounts of uniting petty kingdoms under a single king through \"actual\" combat.\n\nThe SCA's first event did not choose a \"king\". Fighters vied for the right to declare their ladies (only men fought at the first event) \"fairest\", later called the \"Queen of Love and Beauty\".\n\nThe highest ranking titles in the SCA belong to the royalty, followed by the former royalty. Former kings and queens become counts and countesses (dukes and duchesses if they have reigned more than once), and former princes and princesses of Principalities become viscounts and viscountesses. This system is not historically based, but was developed out of practical necessity early in the Society's history.\n\nDirectly beneath this \"landed\" nobility (current and former royalty) rank the highest awards, the Peerages. The SCA has four orders of peerage: the Order of the Chivalry, awarded for skill at arms in Armored Combat; the Order of the Laurel, awarded for skill in the arts and sciences; the Order of the Pelican, awarded for outstanding service to the Society; and the Order of the Masters of Defense, awarded for skill at arms in Rapier Combat. In Several of the Kingdoms the Order of the Rose, made up of former Consorts, is considered a peerage equal to the other four.\n\nPeerages are bestowed by the Crown (the Sovereign and Consort) of a Kingdom. In most cases, this is done with the consent of the members of a given peerage, often at their suggestion. The Society's Bylaws state that \"the Crown may elevate subjects to the Peerage by granting membership in one of the Orders conferring a Patent of Arms, after consultation with the members of the Order within the Kingdom, and in accordance with the laws and customs of the kingdom. Restriction: to advance a candidate to the Order of the Chivalry, a Knight of the Society (usually the King) must bestow the accolade\".\n\nIn May 1999, \"The Onion\" ran a front-page article headlined \"Society For Creative Anachronism Seizes Control Of Russia\" featuring photos of actual SCA participants from the Barony of Jaravellir (Madison, Wisconsin).\n\nMembers of the SCA are given pivotal roles in S.M. Stirling's Emberverse series, where their skills in pre-industrial technology and warfare become invaluable in helping humanity adapt when all modern technology (including firearms) ceases working.\n\nIn his conclusion to the \"Space Odyssey\" series, \"\"; Arthur C. Clarke portrays the SCA as still being active in the year 3001.\n\nThe novel \"Murder at the War\" (\"Knightfall\" in paperback edition) by Mary Monica Pulver is a murder mystery set entirely at the SCA's largest annual event, Pennsic War.\n\nIn David Weber's science fiction novel \"Honor Among Enemies\", main character Honor Harrington mentions that her uncle is a member of the SCA and that he taught her to shoot from the hip (the time the SCA covers having been moved up to the 19th century in the future era in which the novel is set, to include cowboy and Civil War reenactors).\n\nIn Christopher Stasheff's \"Warlock\" series the inhabitants of the planet Gramarye are revealed to be descended from SCA participants. A prequel, \"Escape Velocity\", describes how the SCAdians first came to Gramarye, and how lands were assigned to the royal peers.\n\nIn \"Ariel\" (1983), a post-apocalyptic fantasy by Steven R. Boyett, technology suddenly stops working and sorcery and sword fight take over. Several characters who are former SCA members attribute their survival to their SCA experience.\n\nThe fantasy novel \"The Folk of the Air\" by Peter S. Beagle was written after the author attended a few early SCA events \"circa\" 1968; but he has repeatedly stated that he then studiously avoided any contact with the actual SCA itself for almost two decades, so that his description of a fictitious \"League for Archaic Pleasures\" would not be \"contaminated\" by contact with the actual real-life organization.\n\nIn \"Number of the Beast\", Robert A. Heinlein portrayed an SCA tournament where live weapons were used and the battles actually fought to the 'death'. The defeated combatants were either transported to an alternate reality where medical technology was advanced enough that they could be revived from any wound or transported to the alternate reality that was Valhalla. The contestants' desires were placed in sealed envelopes prior to the tournament, which were destroyed if the competitor won and obeyed if a competitor lost.\n\nIn John Ringo's The Council Wars science-fiction series, characters with SCA or SCA-like experience help their society recover from a catastrophic loss of technology.\n\n\n"}

His status as a historical figure is a matter of debate.\n\nThe Platonic dialogues \"Timaeus\" and \"Critias,\" written around 360 BC, relate (through the voice of Critias) how the Athenian statesman Solon (638–558 BC) traveled to Egypt and in the city of Sais encountered the priests of the goddess Neith. A very aged priest tells him that 9000 years earlier, Athens had been in conflict with the great power of Atlantis, which was then destroyed in a catastrophe.\n\nPlato's dialogue does not mention a name for the priest, but Plutarch (46–120 AD), in his \"Life of Solon\" identified the aged priest as Sonchis:\nPlutarch gives a more detailed description on the Greek philosophers who visited Egypt and received advice by the Egyptian priests in his book \"On Isis and Osiris\". Thus Thales of Miletus, Eudoxus of Cnidus, Solon, Pythagoras, (some say Lycurgus of Sparta also) and Plato, traveled into Egypt and conversed with the priests.

He is mentioned briefly as being slain in battle by Indra along with Anarsani, Pipru, and Ahisuva, after which he \"let loose the floods\". \n\nCertain pseudo-historians theorize that Srbinda is related to, and possibly the founder of, the Serbian nation. Besides the identical root, the fact that the name Srbinda structurally is identical to the modern Serbian word \"Srbenda\", which is a superlative form of \"Serb\", expressing a Serb who is thoroughly and uncompromisingly devoted to all things Serbian. \n\nAustrian historian Walther Wüst theorized in 1934 that Srbinda was a warlord and leader of the Serbs, based on the fact that Serbs use the term \"Srbenda\". He hypothesized that Srbinda and Srbenda were the same word, and that they meant someone great, strong, first among the Serbs - in line with the meaning of \"Srbenda\". He also theorized that when the Veda texts mention that after Indra defeats Srbinda he \"let loose the floods\", that floods were a metaphor for a migration of people, in this case the Serbs, migrating west. \n\nSerbian historian Drasko Scekic stated that Srbinda is the oldest mention of the word 'Srb' in history, and that Srbinda is an ancient Serbian word, predating the Sanskrit language. \n\n"}
{"id": "23026062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23026062", "title": "Tainan", "text": "Tainan\n\nTainan (Hokkien POJ: \"Tâi-lâm\"), officially Tainan City, is a special municipality of Taiwan, facing the Formosan Strait or Taiwan Strait in the west and south. Tainan is the oldest city on the island of Taiwan and also commonly known as the \"Capital City\" (; POJ: \"Hú-siâⁿ\") for its over 200 years of history as the capital of Taiwan under Koxinga and later Qing dynasty rule. Tainan's complex history of comebacks, redefinitions and renewals inspired its popular nickname \"the Phoenix City\".\n\nAs Taiwan's oldest urban area, Tainan was initially established by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) as a ruling and trading base called Fort Zeelandia during the period of Dutch rule on the island. After Dutch colonists were defeated by Koxinga in 1661, Tainan remained as the capital of the Tungning Kingdom until 1683 and afterwards the capital of Taiwan Prefecture under Qing Dynasty rule until 1887, when the new provincial capital was moved to Taipei. Tainan has been historically regarded as one of the oldest cities in Taiwan, and its former name, Tayouan, has been claimed to be the origin of the name \"Taiwan\". It is also one of Taiwan's cultural capitals, for its rich folk cultures including the famous local street food and traditional cuisine, extensively preserved Taoist rites and other living local traditions covering everything from child birth to funerals. The city houses the first Confucian school–temple in Taiwan, built in 1665, the remains of the Eastern and Southern gates of the old city, and countless other historical monuments. Tainan claims more Buddhist and Taoist temples than any other city in Taiwan.\n\nArchaeological excavations in the township of Zuozhen suggest that the Tainan region has been inhabited for at least 20,000 to 31,000 years. The indigenous Siraya tribe dominated the region by the 16th century. The Sakam people of the Sinkan sub-tribe inhabited the area of the present-day city. Other Sirayan sub-tribes, including the Soelangh, Mattauw and Baccloangh inhabited the surrounding area.\n\nBy the late 16th century, Chinese merchants and fishermen had set up several bases along the west coast of the island, including a sandbar across the \"Taikang Inner Sea\" () off the bay of Sakam village (modern-day Fort Provintia). The Chinese adopted \"\" (modern-day Anping) as the name of the sandbar. Slightly north of \"Taioan\", along the shoreline near \"Bassemboy\" (), Japanese traders established bases for trade with China. The early Chinese and Japanese also traded with the Sirayan people. Salt and food was exchanged for deer hides and dried deer meat. The Siraya people were influenced by both Chinese and Japanese cultures and lifestyles. They started to use Chinese words in their language, use Japanese tantō in ritual events, and also migrated inland due to the influx of newcomers. By the time the Europeans arrived, the influence of Chinese and Japanese traders and fishermen was already prominent.\n\nEarly Dutch colonists had attempted but failed to control Macau and the Penghu islands. In July 1622, the Dutch East India Company textile merchant Cornelis Reyersz sailed to Taiwan in search of a suitable location to build a trading post. In 1624 he established a small fort named 'Orange' on the sandy peninsula they called Tayouan (modern-day Anping). The fort was then expanded and renamed Fort Zeelandia. The settlement was initially designed as a base to attack their Spanish rivals and as a trading post between China and Batavia in Indonesia. Later the post became the center of Dutch trade between China, Japan and Europe. During the governorship of Pieter Nuyts (1627–29), there was hostility between the Dutch and Japanese merchants, leading at one point to Nuyts being held hostage by a Japanese trader, Hamada Yahee.\n\nThe Dutch pacification campaign on Formosa was a series of military actions and diplomatic moves undertaken in 1635 and 1636. They aimed at subduing hostile aboriginal villages in the south-western region of the island. In 1642 the Dutch seized the Spanish garrison at Santisima Trinidad in Keelung. The Dutch East India Company became the first authority to claim control of the whole of Formosa, with Fort Zeelandia as the seat of government.\n\nTensions arose between the Dutch and the Chinese inhabitants of Taiwan due to heavy Dutch taxation and Dutch participation in plunder during the collapse of the Ming dynasty. Eventually, this led to the brief, but bloody, Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652. The Dutch crushed the revolt only with the help of the local Sinkanese.\n\nThe settlements near to Fort Zeelandia expanded as a result of the Dutch trading post in the area. In 1653, the Dutch built a new fort, Fort Provintia, in the Sakam area as a center for an agricultural colony. The Dutch encouraged Chinese farmers to migrate to Taiwan to grow rice and sugar cane. The Dutch settlement in southern Taiwan was so successful that, by the 1650s, it had overtaken Batavia.\n\nKoxinga (also known as Zheng Chenggong) was a Ming loyalist and chief commander of the Ming troops on the maritime front for the later emperors of the withering dynasty. In 1661, Koxinga attacked the Dutch colonists in Taiwan. After a nine-month siege, the Dutch Governor of Taiwan, Frederik Coyett, surrendered Fort Zeelandia to Koxinga on 1 February 1662. This effectively ended 38 years of Dutch rule on Taiwan. Koxinga then devoted himself to transforming Taiwan into a military base for loyalists who wanted to restore the Ming Dynasty.\n\nKoxinga set about making Taiwan a base for the Ming loyalist movement. Fort Provintia was renamed \"Tungtu\", and Fort Zeelandia became Anping. Koxinga set up military colonies on the surrounding plains to help feed his forces. Many suburbs surrounding Tainan City today include in their names \"Ying\", \"Jia\", and \"Tian\", all derived from this event. After the death of Koxinga in 1662, his son, Zheng Jing, changed the name of Dongdu to Dong Ning. His chief minister, , introduced Chinese bureaucracy, built the first Confucius temple on the island, and introduced the method of salt production to coastal areas. The British were invited to set up a trading post in Anping to continue trade between Taiwan, Japan, and South East Asia. This helped to maintain the region as a center of trade.\n\nThe death of Zheng Jing in 1681 was followed by a struggle for succession. Seizing the advantage presented by the infighting, on July 17, 1683, Qing naval commander Shi Lang defeated the Tungning fleet in the Battle of Penghu. Two days later, Qing troops landed at Tungning and encountered little resistance. In 1684 the kingdom was incorporated into the Qing Empire as part of Fujian province, ending two decades of rule by the Zheng family. Taiwan Prefecture was established, with its prefectural seat \"Taiwan-fu\" at modern-day Tainan.\n\nIn 1721, Chinese peasants and indigenous tribes rose in rebellion against Qing misrule. The rebels, led by Zhu Yigui, captured Tainan without a fight. Turmoil ensued as the rebels soon fought amongst themselves. It was only after a Qing army was dispatched from mainland China that order was restored. Zhu was captured and executed. As Qing law prohibited the building of city walls in Taiwan, Qing authorities decided to create a defensive boundary around the city by growing bamboo around the perimeter. After several further uprisings across the island, work on a city wall began in the late 1780s.\n\nA flood in 1823 brought rich silt from nearby rivers, which formed a widespread new fertile plain across the Taijiang bay area between Tainan and Anping. A canal system called \"Go-tiau-kang\" (; ) was built to keep the port in Tainan functioning but prevented large ships from entering the bay.\n\nAfter 174 years of restrictions on trade with the Europeans, the Qing reopened Anping port as part of the Tianjin treaty following the Second Opium War in 1858. The Anping Customs house was established in 1864. Western merchants built trading posts near the remains of Fort Zeelandia.\n\nFollowing the murder of 54 Japanese sailors by Paiwan aborigines near the southwestern tip of Taiwan in 1871, the punitive Japanese Expedition of 1874 to Taiwan revealed the fragility of the Qing dynasty's hold on Taiwan. As a result, the Qing sent the imperial commissioner Shen Baozhen to Taiwan to strengthen its defense. In Tainan, Shen made several efforts to modernize the defenses including inviting French engineers to design the Eternal Golden Castle in Erkunshen. He also recommended setting up a telegraph cable link between Tainan and Amoy. Some parts of the castle were built using bricks taken from Fort Zeelandia.\n\nAfter over 200 years of development, Tainan, known as \"Taiwan-fu\", had become the largest city in Taiwan and a Chinese city with foreign influence. The following is a description of the city by the Scottish missionary William Campbell upon his first arrival to the island in 1871:\nIn 1885, the Qing government commenced work to develop the island into Taiwan Province. The capital of the island, or \"Taiwan-fu\", was moved to \"Toatun\" (modern-day Taichung), and therefore the old Taiwan-fu was renamed to the name it bears today – \"Tainan(-fu)\", the seat of Tainan Prefecture.\n\nAs a consequence of the Chinese losing the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were ceded to Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The Republic of Formosa was proclaimed in Tainan in May 1895, in an effort to pre-empt the Japanese occupation. A Japanese army arrived at Tainan in October 1895. Liu Yongfu and the other Republican leaders fled, leaving the city in disarray. A Scottish missionary, Thomas Barclay, was chosen by local elites and foreign merchants to negotiate the Japanese entry into the city. As a result, Tainan was taken without resistance. Under Japanese rule, Tainan was initially administered under . With a population of about 50,000 in 1904, Tainan was Taiwan's most populous city.\n\nThe anti-Japanese uprising known as the Tapani Incident began in Ta-pa-ni (modern-day Yujing) on April 9, 1915. The revolt, led by , spread quickly across the whole island and was supported by both Chinese and indigenous Taiwanese. The Japanese crushed the uprising. Many villages were destroyed and thousands of people were killed during the repression which followed. Yu Qingfang was captured on August 22, 1915. More than 800 people were sentenced to death in Tainan. Over 100 of them were executed while the rest were pardoned by the new Taishō Emperor. The place where the rebellion began, Xilai Temple in Tainan (), was demolished. The event marked a turning point in Japanese policy, from forced pacification to modernisation and integration of Taiwan into the Japanese Empire.\n\nThe Japanese renamed the city to in 1901, and then in 1920. Tainan Prefecture included modern-day Yunlin, Chiayi, and the wider region of Tainan. Tainan served as the capital city. The Japanese transformed Tainan by building modern infrastructure, including schools, a courthouse, city hall, new telecommunication facilities, an extensive freight and passenger rail network, a new Anping canal replacing the \"Go-tiau-kang\", an airport, and an irrigation system across the Tainan and Chiayi regions. Modern urban designs were introduced; old narrow streets and city walls were demolished and replaced with wide streets that form the cityscape of the modern-day Tainan city center. They also introduced much needed sanitary reforms.\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC) took over Taiwan on 25 October 1945 after World War II. Tainan City and Tainan County were established and became separate local entities under Taiwan Province in 1946. There was civil unrest in Tainan as part of the February 28 Incident in 1947. Tang De-Jhang, a Japanese descent and Japanese educated lawyer, was a member of government which set up \"The February 28 Incident Commission\" and a popular candidate for city mayor, was accused of being a separatist and arrested by the ROC army on March 11. He was tortured and executed the next day in the park in front of Tainan City Hall (now named ). Tang was posthumously pronounced not guilty by court later in March. Like other regions in Taiwan, many people in Tainan suffered for their real or perceived opposition to the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party) during the autocratic era.\n\nThe city held its first councilor and mayoral elections in 1950. In the 1960s, Tainan was overtaken by Kaohsiung as the economic center of southern Taiwan due to the redevelopment of Kaohsiung port. While Tainan City struggled through the second half of twentieth century, the county, especially the river south region, benefited from national priority development programmes. The completion of the National Highway No. 1 was followed by the building of many industrial parks and other road improvements. As a result, the city sprawled inland into North, East and then the Yongkang and Rende districts.\n\nIn 1992, a redevelopment plan in the West district, to widen Haian Rd and build an underground plaza proved a failure as lack of geological surveying and overall planning meant that the works ran into a layer of groundwater. The development destroyed part of the historic \"Go-tiau-kang\" area. As a consequence, the Zhongzheng Road district, previously the most popular shopping precinct in Tainan since Japanese rule, went into decline due to the poor quality of the environment. By the mid-1990s, there was a growing awareness of the need to protect Tainan's historical and cultural treasures. Since then, the government and civil societies have worked to protect Tainan's heritage. It is an ongoing issue for Tainan to protect its past while reviving its old business center.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the Southern Taiwan Science Park in 1995, the outskirt of the city saw a rapid growth in population through the 2000s. The city became more prosperous after the completion of several major transport infrastructure plans. The city center shifted eastward in the mid-1990s, closer to the densely populated Yongkang, East and North districts. There are several redevelopment plans to transform these districts into the new business centers of the city.\n\nOn March 19, 2004, President Chen Shui-bian was shot whilst campaigning for re-election in Tainan. The city has been a major center for the pro-independent movement since the end of Japanese rule. On October 21, 2008, Chinese ARATS Vice President Zhang Mingqing was injured when he encountered protesters in Tainan Confucius Temple.\n\nOn 25 December 2010, Tainan County and Tainan City merged to become Tainan special municipality.\n\nOn February 6, 2016, the area was hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake, causing 116 fatalities and major damage, including building collapses (see 2016 Kaohsiung earthquake).\n\nTainan claims its name as one of the Taiwanese cultural capitals for its abundant historic monument and citizen lifestyle. The city is dotted by Taoist temples, Buddhist temples and churches. Many of them are among the oldest in Taiwan. The city also has its own unique traditions and cuisines developed by Chinese frontiers over its long history.\n\nThe lives of Tainan citizens are closely related to many Chinese gods and temples. Parents bring their children to the \"Weaving Maid goddess\" (), the children’s goddess, to wish for good will. Traditionally Chinese people step into adulthood when they are 16. In Tainan, there is a large ritual celebration for all 16-year-olds on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, the goddess's birthday. This extended celebration is unique to Tainan: In the past, families with children working in the harbor took the advantage of this ceremony to show the employers that their children should be paid in adult rate after this day.\n\nBefore any form of exam people visit a temple of Wenchangdijun, the literacy god, to pray for good luck. One of the Wenchang temples is on the top floor of the Fort Provintia. Many final year high school students preparing for university exams visit the temple in June, before the exam. Those asking for marriage visit Yuelao, the god for marriages. People also visit temples for many reasons, from simply praying for good luck to celebrating god’s birthday to even consulting with the other world.\n\nA wedding ceremony in Tainan is a series of complex processes that are very exact and detailed. Both groom and bride need to prepare 12 specific gifts representing different meanings during their engagement ceremony with more to come in the wedding. People believe this complexity is a sign of being civilized.\n\nAnping residents use a special symbol called Sword Lion to keep bad spirits away. During Zheng’s regime, Anping was one of Koxinga's main naval stations. When returning home from military drills, soldiers would put lion-face shields on the main gates of their houses and insert their swords crosswise in the lion’s mouth. Locals incorporate this symbol into the design of their houses as a symbol of security.\n\nMany well-known Taiwanese food dishes originated in Tainan. Since Tainan was a center of sugar production, Tainan cuisine tends to be sweeter than other Taiwanese cuisines. For example, eel noodle soup has a distinctive sweet and sour taste. Milkfish dishes are very popular in Tainan, where locals also call it \"Koxinga's fish\" (). People believe the Chinese name of the fish () was given by Koxinga, and this name has been loaned into Japanese as . The fish are bred in farms located in the coastal outskirts of the city. Many Tainan restaurants and snack stands have histories that trace back to the Qing or Japanese eras.\n\nOn Guo Hua Street (國華街), a lot of restaurants and street vendors sell local cuisine, including such dishes as \"savory rich pudding\" (), oyster omelette, gua bao, and popiah. Local people tend to have these dishes either in the morning or at noon.\n\nTainan is famous for its diversity and density of temples and shrines. Some of them are the only of its kind on Taiwan Island. In all, there are officially listed seven Buddhist temples and eight Taoist shrines (七寺八廟). , Tainan has the most numbers of registered temples among other municipalities, cities or counties in Taiwan, reaching 1,613 temples.\n\nThe seven Buddhist temples are:\nThe eight Taoist shrines are:\nThere are many other well-known temples and shrines not on this list, such as Anping District's Tianhou Temple (supposedly the oldest on Taiwan proper), the Altar of Heaven temple (天壇), and the re-built Xilai temple (西來庵) etc. They are all the centers of religion in Tainan.\n\nDue to its abundant numbers of temples and shrines, the traditional temple decoration crafters and their business flourishes in Tainan. There are masters still passing their knowledge to maintain the temples in the traditional way.\n\nNanyin and Shisanyin were the first types of Chinese music introduced to Tainan; Nanyin is performed mostly for entertainment while Shisanyin is performed in the Confucius worship ceremony. There are two Nanyin clubs in Tainan: Zhenshengshe, a 200-year-old club once dissolved in the 1980s for ten years which then returned with the support from younger generation musicians and Nanshengshe, a 95-year-old club performing globally.\n\nMusic performance is being promoted in Tainan. Tainan City has its own Chinese orchestra and symphony orchestra. There are also private performance groups such as Chimei Mandolin Performance Group, Chimei Philharmonic Orchestra and Chang Jung Christianity University Symphony Orchestra.\n\nTen Drum Art Percussion Group () is a percussion performance group established in the year 2000. The group is dedicated in producing percussion performances that highlights the history, the culture and the image of Taiwan. The group first performed internationally in the festivals during the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Following this event, the group has performed in many occasions both internationally and domestically. The group has its own campus located in an old sugar factory in Rende District. The campus provides education on percussion performances at all levels and regular performances to general public.\n\nOn top of its plentiful living culture, Tainan host several museums and parks. The National Museum of Taiwan Literature is in the former city hall; National Museum of Taiwan History is in the Annan district; Chimei Museum is in the Rende district; Taijiang National Park follows the coast; Anping Historic Scenic Park includes the entire old Anping town and the north ward of Anping harbor; and Siraya National Scenic Area includes the Wusanto Reservoir built by Yoichi Hatta. In the city center, many historic monuments from Zheng’s regime, Qing dynasty, and the Japanese colonial era are preserved including the Confucius temple, two major city gates and former city hall.\n\nTainan has a tangible sense of history and is the site of several spectacular religious festivals. As well as its string of forts, the first capital of Taiwan has some 300 ancient sanctuaries, from the island's first Confucian temple to its first Taoist temple.\n\nThe Taiwan Confucian Temple (or the Scholarly Temple) was built in 1665 by Cheng Ching, son of Koxinga, to offer lectures and cultivate intellectuals. It was the first learning institute for children when Taiwan was ruled by the Qing Dynasty. As a result, it is also called the First Academy of Taiwan.\n\nThe temple is a popular tourist attraction and preserves ancient Confucian ceremonies, which are conducted regularly. The grounds include storerooms for the ritual implements and musical instruments that are used in these ceremonies.\n\nThe National Museum of Taiwan History is located in the Annan District. The construction of the Exhibition and Education Building began in 2005, and opened on 29 October 2011.The main objectives of this museum include collection, categorization, preservation, research, exhibition, education and promotion of artifacts related to Taiwan's history and culture for both locals and visitors.\n\nThe National Museum of Taiwan Literature researches, catalogs, preserves, and exhibits local literary artifacts as part of its multilingual, multi-ethnic focus. The museum is housed in the former Tainan City Hall, constructed in 1916 and famous for its historical significance.\n\nThe National Cheng Kung University Museum is located at the National Cheng Kung University. One of the youngest museums in Tainan. Exhibits important objects from the history of education in southern Taiwan. The museum is ICOM member since 2016.\n\nFort Provintia was built in 1653 by the Dutch during their colonization of Taiwan and was eventually surrendered to Koxinga. Since 1945, the site has been known as \"Chihkan Tower\", a phonetic derivation from \"Sakam\" (also spelled \"Chakam\" or \"Sakkam\").\nIn addition to the site's architectural and artistic significance, its library of dictionaries and business transactions documents the Siraya language spoken by the native inhabitants of the region during Dutch rule.\n\nAs Tainan is the one of the larger metropolitan areas in Taiwan, it has many department stores, shopping malls abeend prestigious boutiques. Several of the best-known luxury brands have branches or counters in Tainan.\nFlower Night Market is a good place to enjoy the Taiwanese lifestyle. It is one of the most famous night markets and it is often considered to be the largest night market of Taiwan; however, unlike the others, this night market is open for business three days a week - Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.\n\nIn Yanshui District, the most important and prominent fireworks in Lantern Festival are the so-called \"beehives\", essentially multiple launchers of bottle rockets. These rocket forts are actually thousands of bottle rockets arranged row atop row in an iron-and-wooden framework. The set-up looks like a beehive full of unleashed gunpowder. When the contraption is ignited, rockets shoot out rapidly in all directions. Dazzling explosives whiz and whirl across the sky and often into the crowd itself, both thrilling and intimidating the spectators.\n\nTainan has a humid subtropical climate, closely bordering a tropical wet-dry sub-climate. The city is characterized by year-round high relative humidity and temperatures (although temperatures do dip somewhat in the winter months), with a rainy season (April to September) and a dry season (October to March).\n\nThe earliest plan of the city was designed by Dutch colonist, Cornelis Jansz. Plockhoy, the designer of this new settlement, laid a 25-30m wide main street (on today’s Minquan Rd Sec. 2) across the settlement and radial roads than ran deep into agricultural developments . The Han Chinese settlement “Heliaogang Jie” (today’s Zhongyi Rd) later crossed the main street of Provintia and formed the so-called \"Shizi Dajie\" (十字大街) or The Great Cross Street. With the fall of the Ming dynasty, new migrants flooded into the settlement. Chinese population boomed from 5,000 to 35,000 between 1640 and 1661. As a result, farmers, deer hunters, traders and craftsmen each formed a colony on the cross street.\n\nDue to the Chinese tradition where different trades and regions worship different Taoist gods, the city later developed into neighborhoods, each with own center temple. Now, after 300 years of Chinese migration, the city has become a showcase of both Taoist and Chinese Buddhist temples. Although the city has transformed dramatically since the late 19th century, the temples remain because of their importance to the locals. Some of the early administration centers have also been transformed into temples for political and social reasons. An administrative building of the Tungning Kingdom became temple of the sea goddess, and the location where Tungning Kingdom performed annual ceremonies of prayer to Heaven is now the Altar of Heaven Temple. Castle Provintia, one of two Dutch forts in Tainan, now has a sea god temple and a literacy god temple built on top of it, creating East-West fusion architecture. Many Han Chinese religious and historic monuments can be found near the old cross street centered by the Castle Provintia.\n\nThe cityscape of modern Tainan was founded under the urban redevelopment programs carried out by Japanese colonial government. The city center adopted a Baroque design similar to the Paris renovation in mid 19th century, the plan connected major facilities via a system of wide streets and five square-roundabouts. Among the five squares, at the center is the most important crossing point. The square is surrounded by the city hall, the fire brigade and the weather bureau. It is connected by a number of avenues heading towards the train station, the airport, military bases and the dock at the end of the Anping cannel. With the police station and the court nearby, this area demonstrated the power of the colonial government within the city. The financial district was located in and between Taishō park and Anping cannel along , the modern day Zhongzheng Rd. It was the busiest street of the city from Japanese rule to the mid-1990s. Many Colonial Baroque style historic buildings from Japanese era can be found in this part of the city.\n\nA three-belt system was adopted by the provincial city official: the green boulevard ring, the blue belt Anping cannel and the Zhonghua road system. The green boulevard ring and Zhonghua road system first appeared on the 1937 city redevelopment plan proposed by the Japanese colonial government.\n\nThe green boulevard was a Japanese response to the garden city trend of early 20th century urban planning. This system connects the Shuipingwen Park to the west, Tainan Park to the north, NCKU to the east and the Athletic park complex to the south. Zhonghua Rd system is an arterial road system, the system now connects major new development areas surrounding old city center. The Anping cannel \"blue belt\" was created after the completion of the \"Fifth redevelopment area\". The project of \"Fifth redevelopment area\" filled the floodplain of old Taijiang lagoon and extended the Japanese Anping cannel into Kunshen lagoon to form an artificial island, this area is also known as \"New Anping\". In contrast to the low rise old city center, many high rise buildings are built along these three rings.\n\nBeyond the city center, Tainan city can be divided into two: the River South Region and the River North Region, bounded by the Zengwen River.\n\nRiver South Region belongs to the Tainan metropolitan area. Satellite towns spread across the region in a radial pattern from the city center. Southern Taiwan Science Park Tainan campus is located at the north of the region. According to the Council for Economic Planning and Development, this region is designated to grow further into suburban sprawl.\n\nThis region is one of the major agricultural centers in Taiwan. There are several regional centers; some of them are as old as Tainan city. These centers are: Xinying, Yujing, Jiali and Madou.\n\nXinying was the seat of the former Tainan County Government and currently serves as the administration center for the region. Yujing is a regional center for the hilly districts east of the city; it is famous for its mango and was the scene of the Tapani incident. Jiali is the regional center of the coastal Tainan. It was the base of the Soelangh sub-tribe. Near the bank of the Zengwen River, Madou is the regional center of the lower plain area that bears the name of the river. The town was home to the Mattauw sub-tribe.\n\nTainan City is a special municipality, which is the highest level local government under Local Government Law of Republic of China. Technically it is at the same level as Province, although Province is being streamlined. The city is led by the elected city mayor and supervised by the city council. Its subdivisions \"qu\" or districts do not have the autonomy power, instead they are administration units only. Further to the citywide election, there are urban villages (里 \"li\") and neighborhood (鄰 \"lin\") functioning as primary local autonomy entity.\n\nCurrently there are two administration centers, one in Anping District and another in Xinying District. They are former Provincial Tainan city government and Tainan county government respectively. Administration centers manages citywide affairs and developments such as education and city planning. Apart from administration centers, there are district offices functioning as local access point to the governmental services.\n\nThe city has generally been seen as a powerbase for the Democratic Progressive Party, especially in nationwide elections. Although before the merger, the Kuomintang (KMT) have always had more seats in the provincial Tainan city council and KMT won the presidential elections (2008) by a narrow margin in the city. On the other hand, Democratic Progressive Party always dominated former Tainan county. In the first municipal election, after the merger, DPP dominated the political demographics of the city. William Lai, a former member of the Legislative Yuan from the DPP won the first mayoral election in 2010.\n\nIn 2001, Hsu Tain-Tsair of the Democratic Progressive Party was elected with 43% of the vote. His closest rival was the Kuomintang legislator Chen Rong-sheng, who garnered 37%. In 2005. Mayor Hsu was re-elected, polling 46% to Chen Rong-sheng's 41%. In 2010, William Lai of the DPP was elected mayor. However, due to Lai's appointment as Premier of the Republic of China in September 2017, the mayor position was replaced by Li Meng-yen as acting mayor.\n\nA majority of city residents have voted for the winning candidates in many presidential elections since the position was first chosen by popular vote in 1996.\n\nIn common with every other city and county in the Republic of China, with the exception of Nantou, a majority of Tainan residents voted for eventual winner Lee Teng-hui and vice-president Lien Chan.\n\n\nOnce reliant on traditional manufacturing industries, the region became a major high-tech industrial hub after the establishment of Southern Taiwan Science Park in 1995. Optoelectronics, integrated circuits, green energy and biotechnology are the park's dominant industries. Prominent companies are Chimei-Innolux, United Microelectronics and TSMC. With the establishment of Tainan Technology Park, Shugu (Tree Valley) LCD Park and Yonkang Technology Park, the city became a major center for the optoelectronics industry in Taiwan with a complete supply chain.\n\nTainan still plays an important role in auto parts, food processing, textiles, plastics and other traditional manufacturing. Notable companies include Uni-President, Chi Mei and Tainan Spinning, which have headquarters in the city. Overall, industrial production accounted for 62.6% of the gross city product in 2010.\n\nAgriculture is important to the city, especially the River North Region. While fisheries and fish farming signify the coastal districts, rice and fruit farms shaped the landscape of the inland agriculture region. The city is famous for its milkfish, oyster, rice, mango, sugar cane, pomelo (文旦), pineapple and lotus seed. A state-funded agricultural research center was established in Xinhua District to ensure the market competitiveness of the crop. The headquarters of the World Vegetable Center, a NPO that aims to improve crop quality in poorer countries, is in Shanhua District.\n\nOnce dominant industries, salt and sugar production are declining to almost non-existence. Taiyen (Taiwan salt) co. and Taiwan Sugar Corp., both headquartered in Tainan, transformed to businesses in biotechnology, quality agriculture, retail and tourism.\n\nOrchid growing is one of the most symbolic agriculture industry for its well-known brand name in the floristry world. A nationally founded special plantation district with R&D resources is established in Houbi District.\n\nTourism is an industry with increasing importance. As the first capital of Taiwan, the wealth resource of cultural heritage and its potential is under exploration. In the first half of 2013, there were over 7 million tourist visited attractions in the city. There are high-end hotels in the city, including the Shangri-la Hotel near Tainan train station.\n\nRetail and services is the largest employment sector in Tainan, margined at 52% in 2010. The city center hosts five department stores including two Shin Kong-Mitsukoshi, two FE21s and Focus square. Apart from the city center, there are shopping precincts around the city, with the strongest presence in East, North and Yongkang districts. 'Dream Mall' is a joint development project between Uni-President Corp. and Tainan Spinning Ltd. It was the largest shopping center in the city when it opened Feb 12, 2015 and the precinct will host the new headquarters of Tainan Spinning and a new five-star hotel. The precinct is in the designated East Tainan second CBD near the border of the East and Yongkang districts.\n\nTainan Station is a major stop on the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) Western Line, with direct connections to Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Hsinchu, and Keelung. There are also local trains to reach closer destinations.\n\nTaiwan High Speed Rail Tainan Station is located just outside the city center, in Gueiren district. The service is accessible to the city center via TRA Shalun Line and two THSR Shuttle Bus Lines. Using the High Speed Rail system passengers can reach Taipei in under ninety minutes.\n\nOriginal plan for system is muted due to the construction cost and the question of insufficient ridership. Upgrading current railway and buses are now considered as alternative citywide modern public transport options.\n\nTainan has three major bus operators. They are Singing Bus Co., Shinan Buses and Kaohsiung Buses, operating in river north region, intercity routes and metropolitan routes respectively. In 2012, the city government called to restructure Singing Bus and Shinan Buses route to form a Tainan City Bus System. This new system, which set to start operation in 2013, has six main routes connecting the city and eight main interchanges. From the main routes 66 branch routes then spread out to service local communities. City government hope this new system will boost the public transports ridership and progress into metro-bus system in the future.\n\nA project to transform the railway in the city center into an underground is underway as part of the National wide \"TRA Rapid Transit Systematization in the Metropolitan Areas Project\". This project will help increase service frequency by eliminate potential disruption between road and rail traffic. Further to underground transformation, two new stations are planned to serve East district commuters. Together with the Shalun HSR link, this section of TRA corridor will become the backbone of the rail transit system in Tainan.\n\nNational Highway Nos. 1 and 3 run close by and connect via local highways to the city itself. Tainan City has a total of of highways, including national, local, and rural highways.\n\nTainan Airport (TNN) is located in the South District is close center city only six kilometers. As a regional airport, it currently operate both domestic and international flights to Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City, Kinmen, Magong and Osaka. Previously there were also services to Taipei's Songshan Airport (TSA), but these were dropped in light of falling revenues (generally agreed to be a result of the High Speed Rail commencing operation in 2007).\n\n\nPublic\nPrivate\n\nSome famous people born, educated or prominent in Tainan, or otherwise associated with the city, include:\n\nTainan is home to the Uni-President Lions, who play their home games at the Tainan Municipal Baseball Stadium. It is also the birthplace of Chien-Ming Wang, Hong-Chih Kuo, Tai-Yuan Kuo, En-Yu Lin, and many other prominent Taiwanese baseball players.\n\nThe following municipalities are sister cities to Tainan City:\n\n\nTainan City also celebrates friendly relationships with four other municipalities, although they are not considered official sister cities.\n\n\n\n"}

The earliest known versions of the text are two manuscript fragments dating to the 9th or 10th centuries that are held at the British Library.\n\nThe \"Testament of Ba\" was transmitted in manuscript form over many centuries, and so there are many different recensions of the text, but not one single, canonical printed version. Two early versions of the text have been identified by scholars:\n\n\nThe \"Testament of Ba\" is also widely quoted in later Tibetan historigraphical works, for example the \"Scholar's Feast\" (\"mkhas pa'i dga' ston\"). The author of the \"Scholar's Feast\" calls the \"Testament\" the \"Rba bzhed\" (with an 'r' prefix to the Ba clan name), and refers to 'genuine', 'impure', 'large' and 'medium' versions of the text.\n\nA later, expanded version of the \"Testament of Ba\", titled \"Sba bzhed zhabs brtags pa\" (\"Supplemented Testament of Ba\"), was produced during the mid 14th century. A manuscript copy of this text was published with a summary in French by Rolf Stein in 1961.\n\nUp until 2009 it was thought that the \"Testament of Ba\" dated back to no earlier than the 11th or 12th century, and therefore its composition may not have been contemporaneous with the late 8th century events that it recorded. However, in 2009 Sam van Schaik of the British Library realised that two Tibetan manuscript fragments catalogued amongst the Chinese manuscripts of the Stein collection (and consequently previously overlooked by Tibetan scholars) preserved a section of the \"Testament of Ba\" relating to the arrival of the Indian monk Śāntarakṣita, abbot of Nalanda University, to Lhasa:\n\nThese two fragments came from the 'Library Cave' at Dunhuang, which was sealed in the early 11th century, and so pre-date all of the other known versions of the \"Testament of Ba\". Van Schaik dates the fragments to the 9th or 10th centuries.\n\nThe text of the British Library fragments is very close to that of the \"Dba' bzhed\" manuscript discovered in Lhasa in 1997, but has some differences that suggest that it represents an earlier recension of the \"Testament of Ba\". Most notably, in the British Library fragments the king is concerned that the foreign monk may have brought evil spirits with him, and so Śāntarakṣita is confined in the Jokhang and interrogated for three months through an interpreter called Ananta. However, the Lhasa manuscript softens the language, politely asking Śāntarakṣita to stay at the Jokhang rather than having him forcibly confined there.\n\n\n\n"}

From 2006 till 2010 it was a central governmental institution with a special status, while from 2010 to 2014 a research budget institution.\n\nOn December 9, 2010, the UINR was discontinued by a decree issued by Viktor Yanukovych and on the same day the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine created the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance as a research institution instead, within the budget from the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.\n\n\nIn May 2015 President Poroshenko signed four laws concerning Decommunization in Ukraine.

They serve to keep outer garments from being soiled or damaged by bodily excretions, to lessen the friction of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, long underwear is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of undergarments have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, such as T-shirts and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as undergarments and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or textile, some undergarments can serve as nightwear or swimsuits, and some are intended for sexual attraction or visual appeal.\n\nUndergarments are generally of two types, those that are worn to cover the torso and those that are worn to cover the waist and legs, although there are also garments which cover both. Different styles of undergarments are generally worn by females and males. Undergarments commonly worn by females today include bras and panties (known in the United Kingdom as knickers), while males often wear briefs, boxer briefs, or boxer shorts. Items worn by both sexes include T-shirts, sleeveless shirts (also called singlets or tank tops), bikini underwear, thongs, and G-strings.\n\nUndergarments are known by a number of terms. \"Underclothes\", \"underclothing\" and \"underwear\" are formal terms, while undergarments may be more casually called, in Australia, \"Reg Grundys\" (rhyming slang for \"undies\") and \"Reginalds\", and, in the United Kingdom, \"smalls\" (from the earlier \"smallclothes\") and (historically) \"unmentionables\". In the United States, women's underwear may be known as \"delicates\" due to the recommended washing machine cycle or because they are, simply put, delicate.\n\nWomen's undergarments collectively are called \"lingerie\". They also are called \"intimate clothing\" and \"intimates\".\n\nAn undershirt (\"vest\" in the United Kingdom) is a piece of underwear covering the torso, while underpants (often \"pants\" in the United Kingdom), drawers, and shorts cover the genitals and buttocks. Terms for specific undergarments are shown in the table below.\n\nNot wearing underpants under outer clothing is known in American slang as \"freeballing\" for men and as \"going commando\" for either sex. The act of a woman not wearing a bra is sometimes referred to as \"freeboobing\".\n\nUnderwear is worn for a variety of reasons. They keep outer garments from being soiled by perspiration, urine, semen, menstrual blood, and feces. Women's brassieres provide support for the breasts, and men's briefs serve the same function for the male genitalia. A corset may be worn as a foundation garment to alter a woman's body shape. For additional support and protection when playing sports, men often wear more tightly fitting underwear, including jockstraps and jockstraps with cup pocket and protective cup. Women may wear sports bras which provide greater support, thus increasing comfort and reducing the chance of damage to the ligaments of the chest during high-impact exercises such as jogging.\n\nIn cold climates, underwear may constitute an additional layer of clothing helping to keep the wearer warm. Underwear may also be used to preserve the wearer's modesty – for instance, some women wear camisoles and slips (petticoats) under clothes that are sheer. Conversely, some types of underwear can be worn for sexual titillation, such as edible underwear, crotchless panties and thongs.\n\nSome items of clothing are designed exclusively as underwear, while others such as T-shirts and certain types of shorts are suitable both as underwear and as outer clothing. The suitability of underwear as outer clothing is, apart from the indoor or outdoor climate, largely dependent on societal norms, fashion, and the requirements of the law. If made of suitable material, some underwear can serve as nightwear or swimsuits.\n\nUndergarments can also have religious significance:\n\nThe loincloth is the simplest form of underwear; it was probably the first undergarment worn by human beings. In warmer climates the loincloth was often the only clothing worn (effectively making it an outer garment rather than an undergarment), as was doubtless its origin, but in colder regions the loincloth often formed the basis of a person's clothing and was covered by other garments. In most ancient civilizations, this was the only undergarment available.\n\nA loincloth may take three major forms. The first, and simplest, is simply a long strip of material which is passed between the legs and then around the waist. Archaeologists have found the remains of such loincloths made of leather dating back 7,000 years. The ancient Hawaiian \"malo\" was of this form, as are several styles of the Japanese \"fundoshi\". Another form is usually called a cache-sexe: a triangle of cloth is provided with strings or loops, which are used to fasten the triangle between the legs and over the genitals. Egyptian king Tutankhamun (1341 BC – 1323 BC) was found buried with numerous linen loincloths of this style. An alternate form is more skirt-like: a cloth is wrapped around the hips several times and then fastened with a girdle.\n\nMen are said to have worn loincloths in ancient Greece and Rome, though it is unclear whether Greek women wore undergarments. There is some speculation that only slaves wore loincloths and that citizens did not wear undergarments beneath their chitons. Mosaics of the Roman period indicate that women (primarily in an athletic context, whilst wearing nothing else) sometimes wore \"strophiae\" (breastcloths) or brassieres made of soft leather, along with \"subligacula\" which were either in the form of shorts or loincloths. \"Subligacula\" were also worn by men.\n\nThe fabric used for loincloths may have been wool, linen or a linsey-woolsey blend. Only the upper classes could have afforded imported silk.\n\nThe loincloth continues to be worn by people around the world – it is the traditional form of undergarment in many Asian societies, for example. In various, mainly tropical, cultures, the traditional male dress may still consist of only a single garment below the waist or even none at all, with underwear as optional, including the Indian \"dhoti\" and \"lungi\", or the Scottish kilt.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, western men's underwear became looser fitting. The loincloth was replaced by loose, trouser-like clothing called braies, which the wearer stepped into and then laced or tied around the waist and legs at about mid-calf. Wealthier men often wore chausses as well, which only covered the legs. Braies (or rather braccae) were a type of trouser worn by Celtic and Germanic tribes in antiquity and by Europeans subsequently into the Middle Ages. In the later Middle Ages they were used exclusively as undergarments.\n\nBy the time of the Renaissance, braies had become shorter to accommodate longer styles of chausses. Chausses were also giving way to form-fitting hose, which covered the legs and feet. Fifteenth-century hose were often particolored, with each leg in a different-coloured fabric or even more than one colour on a leg. However, many types of braies, chausses and hose were not intended to be covered up by other clothing, so they were not actually underwear in the strict sense.\n\nBraies were usually fitted with a front flap that was buttoned or tied closed. This codpiece allowed men to urinate without having to remove the braies completely. Codpieces were also worn with hose when very short doublets – vest- (UK: waistcoat-) like garments tied together in the front and worn under other clothing – were in fashion, as early forms of hose were open at the crotch. Henry VIII of England began padding his codpiece, which caused a spiralling trend of larger and larger codpieces that only ended by the end of the 16th century. It has been speculated that the King may have had the sexually transmitted disease syphilis, and his large codpiece may have included a bandage soaked in medication to relieve its symptoms. Henry VIII also wanted a healthy son and may have thought that projecting himself in this way would portray fertility. Codpieces were sometimes used as a pocket for holding small items.\n\nOver the upper part of their bodies, both medieval men and women usually wore a close-fitting shirt-like garment called a chemise in France, or a smock or shift in England. The forerunner of the modern-day shirt, the chemise was tucked into a man's braies, under his outer clothing. Women wore a chemise underneath their gowns or robes, sometimes with petticoats over the chemise. Elaborately quilted petticoats might be displayed by a cut-away dress, in which case they served a skirt rather than an undergarment. During the 16th century, the farthingale was popular. This was a petticoat stiffened with reed or willow rods so that it stood out from a woman's body like a cone extending from the waist.\n\nCorsets also began to be worn about this time. At first they were called pairs of bodies, which refers to a stiffened decorative bodice worn on top of another bodice stiffened with buckram, reeds, canes, whalebone or other materials. These were not the small-waisted, curved corsets familiar from the Victorian era, but straight-lined stays that flattened the bust.\n\nThere is a myth that Crusaders, worried about the fidelity of their wives, forced them to wear chastity belts. There is no reference, image, or surviving belt to support this story. Most historians of this period are of the view that a chastity belt was worn to prevent sexual assault and that the woman kept the key.\n\nMen's braies and hose were eventually replaced by simple cotton, silk, or linen drawers, which were usually knee-length trousers with a button flap in the front.\n\nMedieval people wearing only tunics, without underpants, can be seen on works like by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, in the\n\nIn 2012, findings in Lengberg Castle, in Austria, showed that lace and linen brassiere-like garments, one of which greatly resembled the modern bra, date back to hundreds of years before it was thought to exist.\n\nThe invention of the spinning jenny machines and the cotton gin in the second half of the 18th century made cotton fabrics widely available. This allowed factories to mass-produce underwear, and for the first time, people began buying undergarments in stores rather than making them at home.\n\nWomen's stays of the 18th century were laced behind and drew the shoulders back to form a high, round bosom and erect posture. Coloured stays were popular. With the relaxed country styles of the end of the century, stays became shorter and were unboned or only lightly boned, and were now called corsets. As tight waists became fashionable in the 1820s, the corset was again boned and laced to form the figure. By the 1860s, a tiny (\"wasp\") waist came to be seen as a symbol of beauty, and the corsets were stiffened with whalebone or steel to accomplish this. Tight lacing of a corset sometimes led to a woman needing to retire to the fainting room. By the 1880s, the dress reform movement was campaigning against the pain and damage to internal organs and bones caused by tight lacing. Inez Gaches-Sarraute invented the \"health corset\", with a straight-fronted bust made to help support the wearer's muscles.\n\nThe corset was usually worn over a thin shirt-like shift of linen or cotton or muslin. Skirt styles became shorter and long drawers called pantalettes or pantaloons kept the legs covered. Pantalettes originated in France in the early 19th century, and quickly spread to Britain and America. Pantalettes were a form of leggings or long drawers. They could be one-piece or two separate garments, one for each leg, attached at the waist with buttons or laces. The crotch was left open for hygiene reasons.\nAs skirts became fuller from the 1830s, women wore many petticoats to achieve a fashionable bell shape. By the 1850s, stiffened crinolines and later hoop skirts allowed ever wider skirts to be worn. The bustle, a frame or pad worn over the buttocks to enhance their shape, had been used off and on by women for two centuries, but reached the height of its popularity in the later 1880s, and went out of fashion for good in the 1890s.\nWomen dressed in crinolines often wore drawers under them for modesty and warmth.\n\nAnother common undergarment of the late 19th century for men, women, and children was the union suit. Invented in Utica, New York and patented in 1868, this was a one-piece front-buttoning garment usually made of knitted material with sleeves extending to the wrists and legs down to the ankles. It had a buttoned flap (known colloquially as the \"access hatch\", \"drop seat\", or \"fireman's flap\") in the back to ease visits to the toilet. The union suit was the precursor of long johns, a two-piece garment consisting of a long-sleeved top and long pants possibly named after American boxer John L. Sullivan who wore a similar garment in the ring.\n\nThe jockstrap was invented in 1874, by C.F. Bennett of a Chicago sporting goods company, Sharp & Smith, to provide comfort and support for bicycle jockeys riding the cobblestone streets of Boston, Massachusetts. In 1897 Bennett's newly formed Bike Web Company patented and began mass-producing the Bike Jockey Strap.\n\nBy the early 20th century, the mass-produced undergarment industry was booming, and competition forced producers to come up with all sorts of innovative and gimmicky designs to compete. The Hanes company emerged from this boom and quickly established itself as a top manufacturer of union suits, which were common until the 1930s. Textile technology continued to improve, and the time to make a single union suit dropped from days to minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, designers of women's undergarments relaxed the corset. The invention of new, flexible but supportive materials allowed whalebone and steel bones to be removed. The emancipation or liberty bodice offered an alternative to constricting corsets, and in Australia and the UK the liberty bodice became a standard item for girls as well as women.\n\nMen's underwear was also on the rise. Benjamin Joseph Clark, a migrant to Louisiana from New Jersey, opened a venture capitalist firm named Bossier in Bossier Parish. One product manufactured by his firm was tightly fitting boxers that resembled modern underwear. Though the company was bankrupt by the early 20th century, it had some impact on men's underwear design.\n\nUnderwear advertising first made an appearance in the 1910s. The first underwear print advertisement in the US appeared in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" in 1911 and featured oil paintings by J. C. Leyendecker of the \"Kenosha Klosed Krotch\". Early underwear advertisements emphasised durability and comfort, and fashion was not regarded as a selling point.\n\nBy the end of the 1910s, Chalmers Knitting Company split the union suit into upper and lower sections, effectively inventing the modern undershirt and drawers. Women wore lacier versions of this basic duo known as the camisole and tap pants.\nIn 1912, the US had its first professional underwear designer. Lindsay \"Layneau\" Boudreaux, a French immigrant, established the short-lived panty company Layneau. Though her company closed within one year, it had a significant impact on many levels. Boudreaux showed the world that an American woman could establish and run a company, and she also caused a revolution in the underwear industry.\n\nIn 1913, a New York socialite named Mary Phelps Jacob created the first modern brassiere by tying two handkerchiefs together with ribbon. Jacob's original intention was to cover the whalebone sticking out of her corset, which was visible through her sheer dress. Jacob began making brassieres for her family and friends, and news of the garment soon spread by word of mouth. By 1914, Jacob had a patent for her design and was marketing it throughout the US. Although women had worn brassiere-like garments in years past, Jacob's was the first to be successfully marketed and widely adopted.\n\nBy the end of the decade, trouser-like \"bloomers\", which were popularized by Amelia Jenks Bloomer (1818–1894) but invented by Elizabeth Smith Miller, gained popularity with the so-called Gibson Girls who enjoyed pursuits such as cycling and tennis. This new female athleticism helped push the corset out of style. The other major factor in the corset's demise was the fact that metal was globally in short supply during the First World War. Steel-laced corsets were dropped in favour of the brassiere.\nMeanwhile, World War I soldiers were issued button-front shorts as underwear. The buttons attached to a separate piece of cloth, or \"yoke\", sewn to the front of the garment, and tightness of fit was adjusted by means of ties on the sides. This design proved so popular that it began to supplant the union suit in popularity by the end of the war. Rayon garments also became widely available in the post-war period.\n\nIn the 1920s, manufacturers shifted emphasis from durability to comfort. Union suit advertisements raved about patented new designs that reduced the number of buttons and increased accessibility. Most of these experimental designs had to do with new ways to hold closed the crotch flap common on most union suits and drawers. A new woven cotton fabric called nainsook gained popularity in the 1920s for its durability. Retailers also began selling preshrunk undergarments.\n\nAlso in the 1920s, as hemlines of women's dresses rose, women began to wear stockings to cover the exposed legs. Women's bloomers also became much shorter. The shorter bloomers became looser and less supportive as the boyish flapper look came into fashion. By the end of the decade, they came to be known as \"step-ins\", very much like modern panties but with wider legs. They were worn for the increased flexibility they afforded.\n\nThe garter belt was invented to keep stockings from falling. \n\nIn 1928, Maidenform, a company operated by Ida Rosenthal, a Russian immigrant, developed the brassiere and introduced modern cup sizes for bras.\n\nModern men's underwear was largely an invention of the 1930s. On 19 January 1935, Coopers Inc. sold the world's first briefs in Chicago. Designed by an \"apparel engineer\" named Arthur Kneibler, briefs dispensed with leg sections and had a Y-shaped overlapping fly. The company dubbed the design the \"Jockey\" since it offered a degree of support that had previously only been available from the jockstrap. Jockey briefs proved so popular that over 30,000 pairs were sold within three months of their introduction. Coopers, having renamed the company Jockey, sent its \"Mascul-line\" plane to make special deliveries of \"masculine support\" briefs to retailers across the US. In 1938, when Jockeys were introduced in the UK, they sold at the rate of 3,000 a week.\n\nIn this decade, companies also began selling buttonless drawers fitted with an elastic waistband. These were the first true boxer shorts, which were named for their resemblance to the shorts worn by professional fighters. Scovil Manufacturing introduced the snap fastener at this time, which became a popular addition to various kinds of undergarments.\n\nWomen of the 1930s brought the corset back, now called the \"girdle\". The garment lacked the whalebone and metal supports and usually came with a brassiere (now usually called a \"bra\") and attached garters.\n\nDuring World War II, elastic waistbands and metal snaps gave way once again to button fasteners due to rubber and metal shortages. Undergarments were harder to find as well, since soldiers abroad had priority to obtain them. By the end of the war, Jockey and Hanes remained the industry leaders in the US, but Cluett, Peabody and Company made a name for itself when it introduced a preshrinking process called \"Sanforization\", invented by Sanford Cluett in 1933, which came to be licensed by most major manufacturers.\n\nMeanwhile, some women adopted the corset once again, now called the \"waspie\" for the wasp-shaped waistline it gave the wearer. Many women began wearing the strapless bra as well, which gained popularity for its ability to push the breasts up and enhance cleavage.\n\nBefore the 1950s, underwear consisted of simple, white pieces of clothing which were not to be shown in public. In the 1950s, underwear came to be promoted as a fashion item in its own right, and came to be made in prints and colours. Manufacturers also experimented with rayon and newer fabrics like Dacron, nylon, and Spandex. By the 1960, men's underwear was regularly printed in loud patterns, or with messages or images such as cartoon characters.\n\nWomen's undergarments began to emphasize the breasts instead of the waist. The decade saw the introduction of the bullet bra pointed bust, inspired by Christian Dior's \"New Look\", which featured pointed cups. The original Wonderbra and push-up bra by Frederick's of Hollywood finally hit it big. Women's panties became more colourful and decorative, and by the mid-1960s were available in two abbreviated styles called the hip-hugger and the bikini (named after the Pacific Ocean island of that name), frequently in sheer nylon fabric.\n\nPantyhose, also called \"tights\" in British English, which combined panties and hose into one garment, made their first appearance in 1959, invented by Glen Raven Mills of North Carolina. The company later introduced seamless pantyhose in 1965, spurred by the popularity of the miniskirt. By the end of the decade, the girdle had fallen out of favour as women chose sexier, lighter, and more comfortable alternatives.\n\nWith the emergence of the woman's movement in the United States sales for pantyhose dropped off during the later half of the 1960s having soared initially.\n\nUnderwear as fashion reached its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, and underwear advertisers forgot about comfort and durability, at least in advertising. Sex appeal became the main selling point, in swimwear as well, bringing to fruition a trend that had been building since at least the flapper era.\n\nThe tank top, an undershirt named after the type of swimwear dating from the 1920s known as a tank suit or maillot, became popular warm-weather casual outerwear in the US in the 1980s. Performers such as Madonna and Cyndi Lauper were also often seen wearing their undergarments on top of other clothes.\n\nAlthough worn for decades by exotic dancers, in the 1980s the G-string first gained popularity in South America, particularly in Brazil. Originally a style of swimsuit, the back of the garment is so narrow that it disappears between the buttocks. By the 1990s the design had made its way to most of the Western world, and thong underwear became popular. Today, the thong is one of the fastest-selling styles of underwear among women, and is also worn by men.\n\nWhile health and practicality had previously been emphasized, in the 1970s retailers of men's underpants began focusing on fashion and sex appeal. Designers such as Calvin Klein began featuring near-naked models in their advertisements for white briefs. The increased wealth of the gay community helped to promote a diversity of undergarment choices. In his book \"The Philosophy of Andy Warhol\" (1975), Andy Warhol wrote:\n\nWarhol liked his Jockey briefs so much that he used a pair as a canvas for one of his dollar-sign paintings.\n\nIn the UK in the 1970s, tight jeans gave briefs a continued edge over boxer shorts among young men, but a decade later boxers were given a boost by Nick Kamen's performance in Levi's \"Launderette\" TV commercial for its 501 jeans, during which he stripped down to a pair of white boxer shorts in a public laundromat. Briefs however remained popular in America from the 1950s (amongst young men) until the mid 1990s and in Australia the brief remains popular today and has become iconic.\n\nThe 1990s saw the introduction of boxer briefs, which take the longer shape of boxers but maintain the tightness of briefs. Hip hop stars popularized \"sagging\", in which loosely fitting jeans or shorts were allowed to droop below the waist, exposing the waistband or a greater portion of boxer shorts, briefs, or boxer briefs worn underneath. The chiseled muscularity of Mark Wahlberg (then known as Marky Mark) in a series of 1990s underwear advertisements for Calvin Klein briefs led to his success as a white hip hop star and a Hollywood actor.\n\nSome people choose not to wear any underpants, a practice sometimes referred to as \"going commando\", for comfort, to enable their outer garments (particularly those which are form-fitting) to look more flattering, to avoid creating a panty line, because they find it sexually exciting, or because they do not see any need for them. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts and kilts, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underpants. This also applies for most clothes worn as nightwear and as swimwear. Some analysts have encouraged people with a higher than average libido to change their underwear more frequently than average due hygiene-related issues of by-products such as cowper's fluid and vaginal lubrication.\nUnderwear is sometimes partly exposed for fashion reasons or to titillate. A woman may, for instance, allow the top of her brassiere to be visible from under her collar, or wear a see-through blouse over it. Some men wear T-shirts underneath partly or fully unbuttoned shirts. A common style among young men (2018) is to allow the trousers to sag below the waist, thus revealing the waistband or a greater portion of whatever underwear the man is wearing. A woman wearing low-rise trousers may expose the upper rear portion of her thong underwear is said to display a \"whale tail\".\n\nThe sale of used female underwear for sexual purposes began in Japan, in stores called burusera, and it was even sold in vending machines. In the 21st century, when the Internet made anonymous mail-order sales possible for individuals, some women in the U.S. and U.K., in response to male demand, began selling their dirty panties, and sometimes other underwear. Some men find the odor of a woman's bodily secretions sexually arousing, and will use the dirty panties as a masturbation aid. The sale of dirty panties, sometimes worn for several days, and sometimes customized with requested stains, is a significant niche in the sex work field. A far smaller market sells used male underwear to male homosexuals.\n\nCelebrity underwear is sometimes sold. A framed pair of Elvis Presley's dirty underwear sold for $8,000 in 2012. Undergarments of Marilyn Monroe, Queen Elizabeth, and former Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph has been sold at auction. The celebrities Jarvis Cocker, Alison Goldfrapp, Nick Cave, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ricky Gervais, Jah Wobble, Fergie, and Helen Mirren donated underwear to be sold for charity.\n\nCommon contemporary types and styles of undergarments are listed in the table below.\n\nIn January 2008 it was reported that, according to market research firm Mintel, the men's underwear market in the UK was worth £674 million, and volume sales of men's underpants rose by 24% between 2000 and 2005. British manufacturers and retailers claim that most British men prefer \"trunks\", or short boxer briefs. The director of menswear of major British retailer Marks & Spencer (M&S), which sells 40 million pairs of men's underpants a year, was quoted as saying that while boxer shorts were still the most popular at M&S, demand was easing off in favour of hipster trunks similar in design to the swimming trunks worn by actor Daniel Craig in the James Bond film \"Casino Royale\" (2006).\n\nIn 1985, Fruit of the Loom, Hanes, and Jockey International had the largest shares of the U.S. men's underwear market; these companies had about 35%, 15%, and 10% of the market, respectively.\n\nGregory Woods, author of \"We're Here, We're Queer and We're not Going Catalogue Shopping,\" stated that in companies often do not market men's underwear to straight men on the assumption that they are not interested in buying underwear for themselves; therefore many such advertisements are catered to women, as well as gay men, to convince them to buy underwear for their husbands. In 1985 Jockey International president Howard Cooley stated that women often shop more than men do, and men request women to buy underwear for them. According to multiple studies conducted circa 1985, 60-80% of men's undergarments for sale had been purchased by women.\n\nA number of major designer labels are renowned for their underwear collections, including Calvin Klein, Dolce & Gabbana, and La Perla. Likewise, specialist underwear brands are constantly emerging, such as Andrew Christian, 2(x)ist, Leonisa, and Papi.\n\nSpecialist retailers of underwear include high street stores La Senza (Canada), Agent Provocateur (UK), Victoria's Secret (USA), and GapBody, the lingerie division of the Gap established in 1998 (USA). In 2000, the online retailer, Freshpair, started in New York and in 2008 Abercrombie & Fitch opened a new chain of stores, Gilly Hicks, to compete with other underwear retailers.\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in Modern History in 1923. He undertook research at the University of Oxford after winning a Bryce Research Studentship.\n\nFrom 1926 he taught history at the Victoria University of Manchester, first as an Assistant Lecturer and then as the Bishop Fraser Lecturer. At Manchester he worked under F. M. Powicke, Professor of Mediaeval History, who influenced Pantin's work for the rest of his life. In 1929 the Royal Historical Society awarded its Alexander Prize to Pantin for his essay \"The General and Provincial Chapters of the English Black Monks, 1215–1540\". The \"Black Monks\" were the Order of Saint Benedict, whose history in England remained a subject of Pantin's research and published works for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1928 Powicke moved to Oxford to become Regius Professor of Modern History. In 1933 Pantin followed, becoming a tutorial fellow and Lecturer in History at Oriel College, Oxford. He was also a university lecturer in mediaeval archaeology and history from 1937 onwards.\n\nPantin was active in the Oxford Architectural and Historical Society (OAHS), serving on the Editorial Committee of its journal \"Oxoniensia\" and on the OAHS's Sub-Committee for Old Houses. He was President of the OAHS 1959–64.\n\nDuring his career at Oxford a substantial number of the city's unique mediaeval buildings were destroyed for redevelopment. In 1936–37 the University of Oxford had a row of historic houses in Broad Street demolished to make way for the New Bodleian Library. In 1954–55 F. W. Woolworth had the mediaeval Clarendon Hotel in Cornmarket Street demolished to make way for a new retail store. In 1959 Oxford City Council had Lower Fisher Row beside Castle Mill Stream demolished as slum clearance. In each case Pantin recorded the buildings as fully as possible before and during their demolition, and published his results in \"Oxoniensia\".\n\nIn 1940 Pantin was appointed General Editor of the Oxford Historical Society. He developed an interest in the archives of the University of Oxford, which in 1946 appointed him Keeper of the Archives.\n\nPantin was appointed a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1948 and was a member of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England from 1963 onwards.\n\nPantin retired from his college and university posts in 1969, and Oriel College made him an Honorary Fellow in 1971. He died on 10 November 1973.\n\nThere was a William Abel Pantin Trust to further historical research in Oxford and support the charitable and educational functions of the Provost and Fellows of Oriel College, Oxford. It was founded in January 1971 and dissolved in August 2013.\n\n\n"}
