Story, walking and hospitality are the cultural route’s central themes. The path focusses on the diverse communities living in the region that share a common heritage in Abraham/Ibrahim as an ancestor and that may identify his story as an important component of their cultural DNA. The path also demonstrates the power of walking: giving people perspective and remembering their origins; it’s a way to connect with others. The path is also a symbol of hospitality and kindness toward perfect strangers.\n\nAbraham/Ibrahim is believed to have lived in the Bronze Age. He traveled with family and flocks throughout the Fertile Crescent, the Arabian peninsula, and the Nile Valley. His story has inspired myriad communities including Kurds, Muslim, Jews, Christians, Alevi, Bedouin, Fellahin, Samaritans, and countless across the world. The Abraham Path Initiative aims to build on this narrative of shared connection with its rich tradition of walking and hospitality to strangers.\nThe path was started in the first decade of the 21st century by the Abraham Path Initiative, a registered 501c3 nonprofit organization based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, with a global network of partners. William Ury, negotiator and author of \"Getting to YES\" helped found the project at Harvard University's Program on Negotiation. Ury's TED Talk speaks about the beginnings of the path and the vision behind the Initiative. Ury says that every culture has an origin-story, and that the origin-story of the Middle East is about how a man and his family walked the Middle East about four thousand years ago. The Abraham Path Initiative is endorsed by the United Nations World Tourism Organization, the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and other international partners . The initiative is a non-profit, non-religious and non-political organization, whose mission is to support local partners in developing the Abraham Path as:\nThe main historical Abrahamic sites on the current Path are Urfa (the birthplace of Abraham according to Muslim tradition), Harran (according to the Hebrew Bible, this is a town Abraham lived in, and from which he received the call to start the main part of his journey), Jerusalem (the scene for the binding of Isaac according to the Hebrew Bible), and Hebron (the location of the tomb of Abraham and his wife Sarah, according to Jewish, Christian and Muslim traditions).\n\nRegions of the current path: \n\n\n\n"}

Named for the late Dr. William Mulloy, an American archaeologist, the library’s collection focuses on Rapa Nui and Polynesian Studies, especially the prehistory, history, ethnology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, osteology and geology of Easter Island.\n\nThe mission of the Biblioteca William Mulloy is threefold. Firstly, the Library seeks to support the field work of archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists, ethnologists and other scholars who come to Easter Island for research purposes. Secondly, the Library promotes the conservation and study of the cultural patrimony of the Rapa Nui people. Finally, the Library provides broad access within the island community to the best scholarly resources in Rapa Nui and Polynesian Studies.\n\nThe collection of the Biblioteca William Mulloy includes books, journals, articles, archival materials, field notes, maps, photographs and audiovisual materials related to Rapa Nui. Dr. William Mulloy’s personal library forms the core of the collection. The Father Sebastian Englert Anthropological Museum, the Chilean Directorate of Libraries, Archives and Museums (DiBAM), the Easter Island Foundation and the Mulloy family have contributed to the original collection, more than doubling it in a short period of time. The library, located on the campus of the museum in the Tahai district of the island, has climate-controlled stacks and a seventy-two square-meter lecture hall, which accommodates approximately thirty persons.\n\nShortly before his death in 1978, the renowned archaeologist, William Mulloy, expressed the desire that his personal library, consisting of books, articles, reprints, field notes, maps, photographs and slides, find a permanent home on Rapa Nui in order to be of service to both specialized researchers coming to the island from abroad and to the general public.\n\nAfter his death, his widow, Emily Ross Mulloy, consigned the collection to Mario Correa, Cultural Attaché of the Consulate General of Chile in Washington DC, who with the aid of Marilyn Pugh of LanChile, transferred the library to mainland Chile. At the time, lack of satisfactory facilities on Rapa Nui did not favor the immediate transfer of library or archival materials. Instead, the collection was entrusted to the Easter Island Foundation. The Foundation maintained the library at the Fonck Museum in Viña del Mar, hired a Rapa Nui librarian and placed the collection at the disposal of the public. In addition to its long-term financial support of the library, the Easter Island Foundation assisted with the relocation of Mulloy Library materials to the island when a suitable space was made ready on Museum premises.\n\nAfter its transfer from Viña del Mar, the Biblioteca William Mulloy opened on Rapa Nui in 2002 and was dedicated by Dr. Mulloy’s widow, Emily Ross Mulloy, Clara Budnik (Director of the DiBAM), and prominent members of the Rapa Nui community.\n\n"}

He is now best remembered for his universal chronicle, the \"Twelve Books of Histories\" (\"Historiarum libri XII\"), which is a source of information about the conversion of Gaul and the history of the Franks. Chronicles such as that of Freculf attempted to show world history from Creation to the present, but most history writing in the eighth and ninth centuries was considerably more local and specific.\n\nFreculf’s origins are unknown, but it is known that he became a bishop in either 823 or 825 until his death on 8 October 850 or 852. He was a pupil of Louis the Pious' chancellor Helisachar and was involved in various issues of the time, including the question of image veneration. He was described as a ‘busy, well-connected man’. Some have observed that Freculf was the first medieval writer to see the post-Roman world as something different. He writes that:\n\nFreculf was sent by Louis to Rome to negotiate with Pope Eugene II about the veneration of images in 824. This issue was one of the main points of contention in the Church at the time. The East Roman Emperor at the time, Michael II, was initially tolerant towards those who venerated images (see Iconoclasm). However, later on in his reign he started persecuting all those who worshiped these images. However, the Franks allowed for veneration, although not adoration, of images. He asked Louis the Pious to persuade Pope Eugene II to ban veneration. Louis complied and one of the envoys he sent was Freculf. However this Frankish embassy failed as Eugene II stated that the second Council of Nicaea had already decided that images can be venerated but should not be adored.\n\nOne of Freculf’s most important works was his \"Twelve Books of Histories\" in two volumes. When he wrote the second part ‘he dedicated it to Empress Judith as a gift for her son Charles [the Bald]’. He hoped that this book would ‘enable princes to take precautions against disadvantages to themselves and to their subjects’. In a letter to Empress Judith of Bavaria, Freculf flatters the empress while at the same time claiming that her son Charles was so like Charlemagne that ‘his grandfather seems not to have died, but rather with the fog of sleep wiped away, to illumine the world anew, indeed his immortal wit, elegance and virtue shine in the grandson together with the name.’ Empress Judith encouraged this comparison of Charles to Charlemagne, something that he would be reminded of throughout his reign. However, the influence of Charlemagne was to go way beyond the reign of Charles the Bald. Freculf also mentioned in his book that he hoped Charles would be ‘our king of a new age’. Freculf also sent Charles the Bald a copy of the military treatise \"De re militari\" by Vegetius.\n\nFreculf’s work, along with Ado of Vienne’s chronicle, are the only examples of chronicles encompassing world history until the late twelfth century. It was only after the 13th century that world chronicles would become more numerous. This work provided an excellent example of how important tradition was for the Carolingians. Part One of the book narrates the history from the creation of the world to the birth of Jesus Christ. The second part consisted of the history from incarnation of Jesus up until around 600AD. His work was centered mainly religious aspects, such as the Visigothic conversion to Catholicism, admiration of Pope Gregory I as a ‘defender of the faith’, all the martyrs, and all six ecumenical councils up until that point. This text, which is often neglected due to its lack of new factual information of contemporary events...crafts a history meant to address present concerns through the 'mirror' of the past.\n\nHowever, Freculf did not use the customary ages-of-the-world or chronological models for organizing his material. Instead he traced history through the fall and rise of potentates, realms, and cults through pagan, pre-Roman antiquity, and then through Israel. He only mentioned Rome because it allowed for peace and prosperity, paving the way for the Church to grow.\n\nManuscripts of his chronicle include:\n\n\n\n"}

Berman (February 13, 1918 – November 13, 2007) was an American legal scholar who was an expert in comparative, international and Soviet/Russian law as well as legal history, philosophy of law and the intersection of law and religion. He was a law professor at Harvard Law School and Emory University School of Law for more than sixty years, and held the James Barr Ames Professorship of Law at Harvard before he was appointed as the first Robert W. Woodruff Professor of Law at Emory. He has been described as \"one of the great polymaths of American legal education.\"\n\nBorn in Hartford, Connecticut, Berman received a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College in 1938, and a master's degree and Juris Doctor from Yale University in 1942 and 1947, respectively. He served as a cryptographer in the U.S. Army in the European Theatre of Operations from 1942 to 1945 and received the Bronze Star for his service.\n\nIn 1948 he joined the faculty of Harvard Law School, where he built a reputation as one of the world's best-known scholars of Soviet law, and held the Story Professorship of Law and later the Ames Professorship of Law. He was a frequent visitor to Russia as a guest scholar and lecturer, even during the height of the McCarthy era. In 1958, he represented the estate of Arthur Conan Doyle in Soviet courts, in an unsuccessful attempt to collect copyright royalties from the government of the USSR.\n\nHe left HLS in 1985 for the Emory University School of Law, where he was the first person to hold the Robert W. Woodruff Professorship of Law — the highest honor Emory can bestow upon a faculty member. Berman was one of the pioneers of the study of law and religion. He played an integral role in the development of Emory's Law and Religion Program, now the Center for the Study of Law and Religion (CSLR), where he served as Senior Fellow. He is also considered one of the founders' of the Journal of Law and Religion. \"He was my mentor, but far more important than that, he was one of the few legal scholars in the country willing to write about both law and religion,\" said Professor Frank S. Alexander, CSLR founding director, who persuaded Berman to join the faculty at Emory Law after being one of his students at Harvard in the early 1970s.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989, Berman consulted leading Russian officials on proposed legislation and led seminars for political leaders and academics on the development of legal institutions.\n\nOne of the world's most distinguished scholars of Soviet and post-Soviet law, Berman was a Fellow of The Carter Center, with a special focus in U.S.-Russian relations. He visited Russia more than 40 times since 1955 as a guest scholar and lecturer on the topic of American law, and he was the founder and co-director of the American Law Center in Moscow, a joint venture of Emory Law and the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. He also took his expertise on Communist and post-Communist law to Eastern Europe and China in recent years, where his writings are well known and widely used.\n\nIn recent years, Berman worked to redress global societal inequalities and to establish systems of trust, peace, and justice in developing countries. He co-founded and co-chaired the World Law Institute, an organization that sponsors educational programs in global law. The Institute opened the first Academy of World Law at the Central European University in Budapest in 2000 and a later comparable program in Moscow.\n\nIn 1991, Berman was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws, \"honoris causa\", by the Catholic University of America; in 1995, the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa, by the Virginia Theological Seminary; and in 2000, the degree of Doctor, honoris causa, by the Russian Academy of Sciences Law University. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1997.\nIn 2005, Berman represented American politician and religious broadcaster Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice in its amicus appearance in Van Orden v. Perry, defending the display of a Ten Commandments memorial on the grounds of the Texas state capitol.\n\nA prolific scholar, Berman wrote 25 books and more than 400 scholarly articles, including \"Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition\" and \"The Nature and Functions of Law\", which is in its 6th edition. The law journal Constitutional Commentary described \"Law And Revolution\" as \"the standard point of departure for work in the field\" [of Western legal history]. On his death, \"The New York Times\" characterized Berman as \"a scholar ... whose forceful scholarship altered thinking about Western law's origins.\"\n\n\n\nIn March 2004, a symposium of some 500 scholars and students gathered at Emory University School of Law to celebrate the scholarship of its three Robert W.

Fear of a \"disarming\" nuclear first-strike that would destroy their command and control systems and nuclear forces led both nations to develop \"launch-on-warning\" capability, which requires high-alert nuclear weapons able to launch on a 30-minute (or less) tactical warning, the nominal flight time of ICBMs traveling between the U.S. and Russia.\n\nA definition of \"high-alert\" requires no specific explosive power of the weapon carried by the missile or weapon system, but in general, most high-alert missiles are armed with strategic nuclear weapons with yields equal to or greater than 100 kilotons.

This was as a result of startling discoveries of relics by Mrs. Selfe and subsequent archaeological excavations that were carried out by Dr. Mary Leakey in 1938 that revealed substantial findings in different areas of the site and levels of occupations. The late Mrs. Selfe was the owner of the property. The renovation of archaeology exhibit was made possible through the kind sponsorship of Kenya Museum Society and consultation of British Institute in Eastern Africa in collaboration with the National Museums of Kenya.\nThe hill comprises particular importance due to the fact that it encompasses several phases of occupation; it also has a long history of archaeological investigation, which began in 1937 with Mary Leakey.\nIn 1937 Dr. Mary Leakey excavated Site I, and she discovered evidence of late Iron Age habitation consisting of a series of rough stone enclosures, and a number of burials. This material according to Sutton belongs to the late Iron Age and is probably around 200 yrs old (Sutton, 1987). During the 1937 excavation, Leakey also discovered a much older occupation layer, dating to the Late Stone Age. Several burials were uncovered; this area is today referred to as the \"Neolithic mass grave\" on signage at the Museum.\n\nDr. Mary Leakey in 1938 excavated Site II and erroneously associated the Sirikwa occupation layers with the pre-Iron Age material on Site I and at the Nakuru burial site. <br>\nIn 1943 the unexcavated portions of the site were recognised as important archaeological resources, and the site was gazetted as a national monument on 26 November 1945.\n\nIn 1965 more excavations were carried by Ron Clarke on Site II, and the southern burial Site I. After these excavations, a small museum was established in the farm house which was previously owned by Mrs. A. Selfe.\n\nDr. Onyango Abunje in 1973–74 excavated the area adjacent to Site I, and he discovered mainly late Iron Age materials, which included two Iron Age pits and burial mounded.\n\nIn 1986, Dr. John Sutton re-investigated Site II and during this time, the investigation revealed three Sirikwa houses. Dr. Sutton concluded by proposing that Site II is indeed not related to Site II and is Iron Age dating to middle centuries of the second millennium.\n\nHyrax Hill is a regional museum under the management of National Museums of Kenya headed by Dr Mzalendo as its Director General. Hyrax Hill is currently run by 12 members of staff and headed by the curator as the chief accounting officer. Ms. Lilian Amwanda is the Curator Hyrax Hill Museum.\n\nThe building was formerly a farm house constructed in about 1900–1910 and ceded to the National Museum of Kenya in 1965 by the owner, the late Mrs. Selfe. The building is rectangular in plan with a veranda along the south façade. It is entered through a 4.8 m wide straight stairway of 5 steps onto a veranda, and then into the main gallery through a protruding porch that forms part of the central space of the building. Inside, this building is divided into three chambers/galleries, the central being the largest. At the back, the building is abutted by two chambers which are used as the Curator's and Education offices respectively.\n\nThe museum has one gallery divided into three chambers; West, East and the central being the largest. The West chamber displays ethnographic materials. The Central chamber displays archaeology of the site; at the center of the gallery there is a model showing the entire site. The East chamber displays natural history objects.\n\nHyrax Hill is small but a prominent rocky lava ridge measuring about 500 meters in length and rising to 50 meters above the surrounding plain. The hill owes its name to the numerous hyraxes that used to live in the rock openings.\nA number of archaeological features ranging in date from possibly 5000 years ago to only 200 years ago have been found on this hill. The oldest is the area of Neolithic occupation with burials on Site I. There is also recent Iron Age activity on Site I and earlier Iron Age activity on Site II.\nInterest in the archaeology of this area began in the 1920s with the discovery by a farmer of ancient burials with stone bowls hidden under rocks on the side of small hill to the north east. Louis Leakey investigated these ancient burials and reported that they belong to an early pastoralist community which he called 'Neolithic '. At the same time he noticed other archaeological features on both sides of hyrax hill, and in 1937 encouraged his wife, Mary, to investigate these.\nHyrax Hill has been central to the development of archaeological research in Kenya for over seventy years. Together with other sites in the region, it has helped our understanding of the transition from a hunting and gathering way of life to greater dependence on food production, especially pastoral activities in these high grasslands.\n\nAmong the 400 objects and works of art exhibited, visitors can admire carved masks, wood statues and other objects made by the Musas between 1970 and 2000. There are other objects collected from the grass-fields, such as traditional musical instruments, hunting gadgets, metal works, bamboo objects and pottery. Temporary exhibitions are also sometimes proposed.\n\n\n\n"}

It formed around the fifteenth century. According to legend, its ruling dynasty was founded by Obanta of Ile-Ife.\nThe kingdom was one of the most developed in the region with a complex and highly organized government. The capital was at Ijebu Ode where the Awujale from the Yoruba words \"agbeja ile\" had his palace. Counterbalancing the Awujale was the Osugbo (known as the Ogboni in other parts of Nigeria), a council of all free born men that acted as the kingdom's courts. The Osugbo was divided into six groups based on rank, the highest being the iwarefa, whose head the Oliwa was the second most powerful figure in the nation. Also powerful was the Olisa who could be described as the mayor of Ijebu Ode. Like many African societies, Ijebu was also divided into three age ranks and these groups each had their own leaders. The Kingdom is made up of several towns that stretches to parts of Lagos State and borders Ondo State. These towns includes Sagamu, Ijebu-Igbo, Imota, Ikorodu, Epe, Lagos,Ijebu-Isiwo(Pronounced as Ijebu-Ishiwo),Ogun Waterside, Iwopin, Lekki in Lagos State, Ijebu-Imushin, Ijebu-Ife, Apunren, Erunwon, Isonyin, Ososa, Odogbolu and Ago-Iwoye.\n\nThe state rose in power in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries mainly due to its important position on the trade routes between Lagos and Ibadan. The kingdom imposed sharp limits on trade insisting that all trade through the region be conducted by Ijebu merchants. The monopoly brought great wealth to the kingdom, but also annoyed Europeans.\n\nIn 1892 the British attacked Ijebu in response to its barriers on trade. The British were successful and occupied the capital, burning the meeting hall of the Osugbo. The British army employed Maxim guns, according to the soldier-adventurer Frederick Lugard. In defending himself against charges of excessive death rates in Uganda from his own use of the gun, he stated: \"On the West Coast, in the 'Jebu' war, undertaken by Government, I have been told 'several thousands' were mowed down by the Maxim.\"\n\nFor several years the capital was occupied by British troops as the kingdom was annexed to the colony of Southern Nigeria. Today, it constitutes one of the traditional states of Nigeria.\n\nThe Ijebu kingdom was governed by a king and his group of elders, who usually were men of a higher status and of considerable influence. The council governed the region and had representatives of further devolved councils who no longer have any power. Since the invasion of Lord Lugard these councils have continued to meet and advise the Obanta, their power, however, is largely ceremonial since the establishment of British Rule in their protectorate. The elders were known to represent their various villages and the will of the people and are now not such a significant part in the ceremonial process.The elders were all given individual titles and the lead elder was given the title prince, although he was never to inherit the kingship, except in special circumstances. The traditional belief was similar to that of the Chinese Mandate of Heaven.\nThe kind of Yoruba spoken in Ijebu lands is Ijebu\n\nThe current king is Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, the Awujale\n\n"}

He was a cleric and probably the spiritual chancellor of the Diocese of Winchester. His major work is an Anglo-Norman verse chronicle of the war between Henry II of England and his son Henry the Young King and William I of Scotland in 1173–1174. As literature, it stands, according to its latest editor, \"absolutely first class\".\n\nIt has been conjectured that Fantosme was an Italian (named \"Giordano Fantasma\") who came to England in the train of Henry of Blois. A few lines from his poem suggests that he was Scoto-Norman, but this may have been inserted for the sake of the minstrels who would be reciting the piece. On the other hand, Fantosme may have simply identified with his adopted country, he referred to messengers of William, who were also subjects of the Young King, as \"noz\" (ours). Considering his evident knowledge and skill in the Anglo-Norman language, the most likely hypothesis is that he was Anglo-Norman.\n\nFantosme was in fact a partisan of Henry II, though his work has been noted for its impartiality and admired for its detail and vigour. Nonetheless, it has been criticised frequently in the past, because of its unusual metre, as a deterioration of the continental French style, but more recent analysis by R. C. Johnston has led to the conclusion that in fact Fantosme's chronicle represents a conscious insular style of French verse. This hypothesis rests in part on the assumption that Fantosme integrated some characteristics of Occitan verse (perhaps \"coblas\" by the troubadour Jaufre Rudel) he encountered during a stay in Poitiers in the 1140s, where he probably studied under Gilbert de la Porrée. Fantosme was a contemporary and often claimed to be an eye-witness of the events he describes, but another probable source is Richard of Ilchester, his bishop. His work is in general a reliable historical source.\n\nA Goliardic Latin poem defending the incarnation and atonement of Jesus Christ and which is preserved in many manuscripts is entitled in one near-contemporary source as \"Rithmus Jordanis Fantasmatis\" and it is likely that the author was Fantosme, or at least believed to be Fantosme. Elsewhere the skillful poem is entitled \"Prædicatio Goliæ\" (\"Preaching of Golias\").\n\nA legal document of 10 April 1160 refers to a \"Magistrum Jordanum Fantasma\" in Fareham near Portsmouth. He is recorded in connexion with the diocese of Winchester between about 1150 and 1180. At about the time of the war he versified he was involved in a suit against John Joichel, who had an unlicensed opened a school in Winchester; he won the suit.\n\nThere is a nineteenth-century English translation of his chronicle available online at GoogleBooks:\n\nJordan Fantosme's Chronicle.

The three legendary brothers appear together in the \"Wielkopolska Chronicle\", compiled in the early 14th century. The legend states that the brothers, on a hunting trip, followed different prey and thus travelled (and settled) in different directions; Lech in the north, Czech in the west, and Rus in the East. There are multiple versions of the legend, including several regional variants throughout West Slavic, and to lesser extent, other Slavic countries that mention only one or two brothers. The three also figure into the origin myth of South Slavic peoples in some legends.\n\nIn the Polish version of the legend, three brothers went hunting together but each of them followed a different prey and eventually they all traveled in different directions. Rus went to the east, Čech headed to the west to settle on the Říp Mountain rising up from the Bohemian hilly countryside, while Lech traveled north. There, while hunting, he followed his arrow and suddenly found himself face-to-face with a fierce, white eagle guarding its nest from intruders. Seeing the eagle against the red of the setting sun, Lech took this as a good omen and decided to settle there. He named his settlement Gniezno (Polish \"gniazdo\" - 'nest') in commemoration and adopted the White Eagle as his coat-of-arms. The white eagle remains a symbol of Poland to this day, and the colors of the eagle and the setting sun are depicted in Poland's coat of arms, as well as its flag, with a white stripe on top for the eagle, and a red stripe on the bottom for the sunset.\n\nAccording to \"Wielkopolska Chronicle\" (13th century), Slavs are descendants of Pan, a Pannonian prince. He had three sons - Lech (the oldest), Rus, and Čech (the youngest), who decided to settle west, north, and east.\n\nA variant of this legend, involving only two brothers, is also known in the Czech Republic. The apparently best known version by the 19th century author Alois Jirásek appeared in his retelling of \"Staré pověsti české (Old Bohemian Legends)\". While the older chronicles from 14th century (such as those of Dalimil, Wenceslaus Hajek and Přibík Pulkava z Radenína) the location of Čech and Lech's homeland \"Charvaty\" is not specified, in the work of Jirásek it is more closely determined; \"Za Tatrami, v rovinách při řece Visle rozkládala se od nepaměti charvátská země, část prvotní veliké vlasti slovanské\" (Behind the Tatra Mountains, in the plains of the river Vistula, stretched from immemorial time Charvátská country (probably White Croatia), the initial part of the great Slavic homeland), and \"V té charvátské zemi bytovala četná plemena, příbuzná jazykem, mravy, způsobem života\" (In Charvátská existed numerous tribes, related by language, manners, and way of life). However, numerous battles had made the country very unfavorable for the people, who were accustomed to live in peace, cultivate the land and grow grain. \n\nAccording to other versions, the reason was that Čech had been accused of a murder. They gathered their people and set off towards the sunset. As in the Polish version, Čech is identified as the founder of the Czech nation (\"Češi\" pl.) and Lech as the founder of the Polish nation.\n\nAccording to the Chronicle of Dalimil (1314), when Čech and his people climbed Říp Mountain, he looked upon the landscape and told his brothers that they have reached the promised land: a country where there are enough of beasts, birds, fish and bees so that their tables will be always full, and where they could defend themselves against enemies. He settled in the area with a tribe and, according to the \"Přibík Pulkava\" version (circa 1374), his brother Lech continued his journey to the lowlands over the snowy mountains of the north, where he founded Poland.\n\nWenceslaus Hajek's version from 1541 adds many (probably fanciful) details not found in other sources. According to Hájek, the brothers were dukes who had already owned castles in their homeland before their arrival in the region and dates their arrival to the year 644.\n\nA similar legend (with partly changed names) was also registered in folk tales at two widely separated locations in Croatia: in the Kajkavian dialect of Krapina in Zagorje (northern Croatia) and in the Chakavian dialect of Poljica on the Adriatic Sea (central Dalmatia). The Croatian variant was described and analysed in detail by S. Sakač in 1940.\n\nIn the Bohemian chronicles, Čech appears on his own or only with Lech. Čech is first mentioned in Latin as \"Bohemus\" in the Cosmas' chronicle of 1125. The earliest Polish mention of Lech, Čech, and Rus is found in the \"Chronicle of Greater Poland\" written at the end of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century.\nThe legend suggests a common ancestry of the Poles, Czechs and possibly Rus people, and illustrates the fact that as early as the 13th century at least three different Slavic peoples were aware of being ethnically and linguistically interrelated and, indeed, derived from a common root stock. The legends also agree on the location of the homeland of the Early Slavic peoples in Eastern Europe. This area overlapped the region presumed by mainstream scholarship to be the Proto-Indo-European homeland in the general region of the Pontic-Caspian steppe. In the framework of the Kurgan hypothesis, \"the Indo-Europeans who remained after the migrations became speakers of Balto-Slavic\".\n\nThe most well-known version of the legend is seen to be somewhat Polocentric, as it mentions a national symbol (the white eagle) only for Lech and the Polish nation, while relegating the two other brothers Czech and Rus to secondary characters. Furthermore, this particular version does not address the origin of the South Slavonic peoples.\n\nThe legend also attempts to explain the etymology of the ethnonyms: Lechia (another name for Poland including Silesia), the Czech lands (including Bohemia, Moravia, and also Silesia), and Rus'. Jan Kochanowski, a prominent Renaissance Polish man of letters, in his essay on the origin of the Slavs, makes no mention of the third \"brother\", Rus. Moreover, he dismisses the legend entirely, stating that \"no historian who has taken up the subject of the Slavic nation [...] mentions any of those two Slavic leaders, Lech and Czech\". He goes on to assume that \"Czechy\" and \"Lechy\" are quite probably the original names for the two nations, although he does not dismiss the possibility that there might have been a great leader by the name Lech whose name replaced the original and later forgotten name for the Polish nation.\n\nThree large oaks in the garden adjacent to the 18th-century palace in Rogalin, Greater Poland, are named after the brothers (\"Lech, Czech i Rus\"), and are several hundred years old. They vary between in circumference. They are part of the Rogalin Landscape Park, and together with other they have been declared nature monuments and placed under protection.\n\n"}

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\n\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his \"Canon\", prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1: for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise \"De Divina Proportione\" (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as \"De Prospectiva Pingendi\", and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work \"Melencolia I\". In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.\n\nMathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as linear perspective, the analysis of symmetry, and mathematical objects such as polyhedra and the Möbius strip. Magnus Wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra, originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as recursion and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by Rene Magritte and in engravings by M. C. Escher. Computer art often makes use of fractals including the Mandelbrot set, and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as cellular automata. Controversially, the artist David Hockney has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the camera lucida to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that Vermeer used the camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings.\n\nOther relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, the finding that traditional batiks from different regions of Java have distinct fractal dimensions, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially Filippo Brunelleschi's theory of perspective, which eventually led to Girard Desargues's projective geometry. A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's \"The Ancient of Days\".\n\nPolykleitos the elder (c.450–420 BC) was a Greek sculptor from the school of Argos, and a contemporary of Phidias. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician Xenocrates, Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of Classical antiquity for his work on the \"Doryphorus\" and the statue of Hera in the Heraion of Argos. While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired. In the \"Canon\" of Polykleitos, a treatise he wrote designed to document the \"perfect\" anatomical proportions of the male nude, Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body.\n\nPolykleitos uses the distal phalanx of the little finger as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body. Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the square root of two () to get the distance of the second phalanges and multiplies the length again by to get the length of the third phalanges. Next, he takes the finger length and multiplies that by to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the ulna. This geometric series of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.\n\nThe influence of the \"Canon\" of Polykleitos is immense in Classical Greek, Roman, and Renaissance sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that Pythagorean thought influenced the \"Canon\" of Polykleitos. The \"Canon\" applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and \"symmetria\" (Greek for \"harmonious proportions\") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous geometric progressions.\n\nIn classical times, rather than making distant figures smaller with linear perspective, painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used reverse perspective for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his \"Book of Optics\" in 1021, but never applied it to art. The Renaissance saw a rebirth of Classical Greek and Roman culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand nature and the arts. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure out how to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.\n\nThe rudiments of perspective arrived with Giotto (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi and his friend Leon Battista Alberti demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using similar triangles as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects. Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but Masaccio's painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.\nThe Italian painter Paolo Uccello (1397–1475) was fascinated by perspective, as shown in his paintings of \"The Battle of San Romano\" (c. 1435–1460): broken lances lie conveniently along perspective lines.\n\nThe painter Piero della Francesca (c.1415–1492) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He was an expert mathematician and geometer, writing books on solid geometry and perspective, including \"De Prospectiva Pingendi (On Perspective for Painting)\", \"Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)\", and \"De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids)\". The historian Vasari in his \"Lives of the Painters\" calls Piero the \"greatest geometer of his time, or perhaps of any time.\" Piero's interest in perspective can be seen in his paintings including the Polyptych of Perugia, the \"San Agostino altarpiece\" and \"The Flagellation of Christ\". His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including Luca Pacioli in his \"De Divina Proportione\" and Leonardo da Vinci. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of Archimedes. He was taught commercial arithmetic in \"abacus schools\"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks, perhaps including Leonardo Pisano (Fibonacci)'s 1202 \"Liber Abaci\". Linear perspective was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 \"De pictura\": \"light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of pyramid with the eye as vertex.\" A painting constructed with linear perspective is a cross-section of that pyramid.\n\nIn \"De Prospectiva Pingendi\", Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: he defines the point as \"the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend\". He uses deductive logic to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.\n\nThe artist David Hockney argued in his book \"\" that artists started using a camera lucida from the 1420s, resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including Ingres, Van Eyck, and Caravaggio. Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct. Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially that Vermeer had used a different device, the camera obscura, to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.\n\nIn 1509, Luca Pacioli (c. 1447–1517) published \"De divina proportione\" on mathematical and artistic proportion, including in the human face. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids. These, such as the rhombicuboctahedron, were among the first to be drawn to demonstrate perspective by being overlaid on top of each other. The work discusses perspective in the works of Piero della Francesca, Melozzo da Forlì, and Marco Palmezzano. Da Vinci studied Pacioli's \"Summa\", from which he copied tables of proportions. In \"Mona Lisa\" and \"The Last Supper\", Da Vinci's work incorporated linear perspective with a vanishing point to provide apparent depth. \"The Last Supper\" is constructed in a tight ratio of 12:6:4:3, as is Raphael's \"The School of Athens\", which includes Pythagoras with a tablet of ideal ratios, sacred to the Pythagoreans. In \"Vitruvian Man\", Leonardo expressed the ideas of the Roman architect Vitruvius, innovatively showing the male figure twice, and centring him in both a circle and a square.\n\nAs early as the 15th century, curvilinear perspective found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. Jan van Eyck's 1434 \"Arnolfini Portrait\" contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene, while Parmigianino's \"Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror\", c. 1523–1524, shows the artist's largely undistorted face at the centre, with a strongly curved background and artist's hand around the edge.\n\nThree-dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art, as in technical drawing, by means other than perspective. Oblique projections, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the Ukiyo-e paintings of Torii Kiyonaga (1752–1815).\n\nThe golden ratio (roughly equal to 1.618) was known to Euclid. The golden ratio has persistently been claimed in modern times to have been used in art and architecture by the ancients in Egypt, Greece and elsewhere, without reliable evidence. The claim may derive from confusion with \"golden mean\", which to the Ancient Greeks meant \"avoidance of excess in either direction\", not a ratio. Pyramidologists since the nineteenth century have argued on dubious mathematical grounds for the golden ratio in pyramid design. The Parthenon, a 5th-century BC temple in Athens, has been claimed to use the golden ratio in its façade and floor plan, but these claims too are disproved by measurement. The Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia has similarly been claimed to use the golden ratio in its design, but the ratio does not appear in the original parts of the mosque. The historian of architecture Frederik Macody Lund argued in 1919 that the Cathedral of Chartres (12th century), Notre-Dame of Laon (1157–1205) and Notre Dame de Paris (1160) are designed according to the golden ratio, drawing regulator lines to make his case. Other scholars argue that until Pacioli's work in 1509, the golden ratio was unknown to artists and architects. For example, the height and width of the front of Notre-Dame of Laon have the ratio 8/5 or 1.6, not 1.618. Such Fibonacci ratios quickly become hard to distinguish from the golden ratio. After Pacioli, the golden ratio is more definitely discernible in artworks including Leonardo's \"Mona Lisa\".\n\nAnother ratio, the only other morphic number, was named the plastic number in 1928 by the Dutch architect Hans van der Laan (originally named \"le nombre radiant\" in French). Its value is the solution of the cubic equation\n\nan irrational number which is approximately 1.325. According to the architect Richard Padovan, this has characteristic ratios and , which govern the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan used these ratios when designing the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church in the Netherlands.\n\nPlanar symmetries have for millennia been exploited in artworks such as carpets, lattices, textiles and tilings.\n\nMany traditional rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave kilims, are divided into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver. In kilims from Anatolia, the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of frieze group pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.\nThe mathematician and architectural theorist Nikos Salingaros suggests that the \"powerful presence\" (aesthetic effect) of a \"great carpet\" such as the best Konya two-medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect Christopher Alexander. These techniques include making opposites couple; opposing colour values; differentiating areas geometrically, whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles; providing small-scale complexity (from the knot level upwards) and both small- and large-scale symmetry; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales (with a ratio of about 2.7 from each level to the next). Salingaros argues that \"all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of the above ten rules\", and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules.\n\nElaborate lattices are found in Indian Jali work, carved in marble to adorn tombs and palaces. Chinese lattices, always with some symmetry, exist in 14 of the 17 wallpaper groups; they often have mirror, double mirror, or rotational symmetry. Some have a central medallion, and some have a border in a frieze group. Many Chinese lattices have been analysed mathematically by Daniel S. Dye; he identifies Sichuan as the centre of the craft.\n\nSymmetries are prominent in textile arts including quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving, where they may be purely decorative or may be marks of status. Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can have a wide variety of reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.\n\nIslamic art exploits symmetries in many of its artforms, notably in girih tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 radians), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with strapwork lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists Peter Lu and Paul Steinhardt argued that girih resembled quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Elaborate geometric zellige tilework is a distinctive element in Moroccan architecture. Muqarnas vaults are three-dimensional but were designed in two dimensions with drawings of geometrical cells.\n\nThe Platonic solids and other polyhedra are a recurring theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the small stellated dodecahedron, attributed to Paolo Uccello, in the floor of the San Marco Basilica in Venice; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for Luca Pacioli's 1509 book \"The Divine Proportion\"; as a glass rhombicuboctahedron in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in Albrecht Dürer's engraving Melencolia I; and in Salvador Dalí's painting \"The Last Supper\" in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron.\n\nAlbrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a German Renaissance printmaker who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, \"Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement)\", meant to teach the subjects of linear perspective, geometry in architecture, Platonic solids, and regular polygons. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of Luca Pacioli and Piero della Francesca during his trips to Italy. While the examples of perspective in \"Underweysung der Messung\" are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of polyhedral nets, polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing. Dürer published another influential book on human proportions called \"Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion)\" in 1528.\n\nDürer's well-known engraving \"Melencolia I\" depicts a frustrated thinker sitting by a truncated triangular trapezohedron and a magic square. These two objects, and the engraving as a whole, have been the subject of more modern interpretation than the contents of almost any other print, including a two-volume book by Peter-Klaus Schuster, and an influential discussion in Erwin Panofsky's monograph of Dürer.\nSalvador Dalí's \"Corpus Hypercubus\" depicts an unfolded three-dimensional net for a hypercube, a four-dimensional regular polyhedron.\n\nTraditional Indonesian wax-resist batik designs on cloth combine representational motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a fractal dimension between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of Cirebon has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of Yogyakarta and Surakarta (Solo) in Central Java have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of Lasem on the north coast of Java and of Tasikmalaya in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.\n\nThe drip painting works of the modern artist Jackson Pollock are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 \"Number 14\" has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, \"Blue Poles\", took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.\n\nThe astronomer Galileo Galilei in his \"Il Saggiatore\" wrote that \"[The universe] is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures.\" Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first, in Galileo's view, fully understand mathematics. Mathematicians, conversely, have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality. The mathematician Felipe Cucker suggests that mathematics, and especially geometry, is a source of rules for \"rule-driven artistic creation\", though not the only one. Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship are described below.\n\nThe mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, stating that \"the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality\", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research. King cites the mathematician G. H. Hardy's 1940 essay \"A Mathematician's Apology\". In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of classical times as first rate, namely Euclid's proof there are infinitely many prime numbers, and the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for mathematical elegance: \"\"seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability\", and \"economy\"\" (King's italics), and describes the proof as \"aesthetically pleasing\". The Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: \"Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I \"know\" numbers are beautiful.\"\n\nMathematics can be discerned in many of the arts, such as music, dance, painting, architecture, and sculpture. Each of these is richly associated with mathematics. Among the connections to the visual arts, mathematics can provide tools for artists, such as the rules of linear perspective as described by Brook Taylor and Johann Lambert, or the methods of descriptive geometry, now applied in software modelling of solids, dating back to Albrecht Dürer and Gaspard Monge. Artists from Luca Pacioli in the Middle Ages and Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer in the Renaissance have made use of and developed mathematical ideas in the pursuit of their artistic work. The use of perspective began, despite some embryonic usages in the architecture of Ancient Greece, with Italian painters such as Giotto in the 13th century; rules such as the vanishing point were first formulated by Brunelleschi in about 1413, his theory influencing Leonardo and Dürer. Isaac Newton's work on the optical spectrum influenced Goethe's \"Theory of Colours\" and in turn artists such as Philipp Otto Runge, J. M. W. Turner, the Pre-Raphaelites and Wassily Kandinsky. Artists may also choose to analyse the symmetry of a scene. Tools may be applied by mathematicians who are exploring art, or artists inspired by mathematics, such as M. C. Escher (inspired by H. S. M. Coxeter) and the architect Frank Gehry, who more tenuously argued that computer aided design enabled him to express himself in a wholly new way.\n\nThe artist Richard Wright argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either \"as processes to simulate phenomena\" or as works of \"computer art\". He considers the nature of mathematical thought, observing that fractals were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such. Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to \"come to terms with cultural artifacts like art, the tension between objectivity and subjectivity, their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems.\" He gives as instances an image from the Mandelbrot set, an image generated by a cellular automaton algorithm, and a computer-rendered image, and discusses, with reference to the Turing test, whether algorithmic products can be art. Sasho Kalajdzievski's \"Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics\" takes a similar approach, looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings, fractals and hyperbolic geometry.\n\nSome of the first works of computer art were created by Desmond Paul Henry's \"Drawing Machine 1\", an analogue machine based on a bombsight computer and exhibited in 1962. The machine was capable of creating complex, abstract, asymmetrical, curvilinear, but repetitive line drawings. More recently, Hamid Naderi Yeganeh has created shapes suggestive of real world objects such as fish and birds, using formulae that are successively varied to draw families of curves or angled lines. Artists such as Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen create works of generative or algorithmic art by writing scripts for a software system such as \"Structure Synth\": the artist effectively directs the system to apply a desired combination of mathematical operations to a chosen set of data.\n\nThe mathematician and theoretical physicist Henri Poincaré's \"Science and Hypothesis\" was widely read by the Cubists, including Pablo Picasso and Jean Metzinger. Poincaré viewed Euclidean geometry as just one of many possible geometric configurations, rather than as an absolute objective truth. The possible existence of a fourth dimension inspired artists to question classical : non-Euclidean geometry became a valid alternative. The concept that painting could be expressed mathematically, in colour and form, contributed to Cubism, the art movement that led to abstract art. Metzinger, in 1910, wrote that: \"[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry\". Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:\n\nMaurice Princet joined us often ... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked \"n\"-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.\n\nThe impulse to make teaching or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes. Some of these have inspired artists such as the Dadaists Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp and Max Ernst, and following Man Ray, Hiroshi Sugimoto.\nMan Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, including \"Objet mathematique\" (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented Enneper surfaces with constant negative curvature, derived from the pseudo-sphere. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was \"abstract\", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [Enneper surface] formula \"meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature.\" He used his photographs of the mathematical models as figures in his series he did on Shakespeare's plays, such as his 1934 painting \"Antony and Cleopatra\". The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in \"ForbesLife\", argues that Man Ray photographed \"the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse\", and \"ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire\". Twentieth century sculptors such as Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo took inspiration from mathematical models. Moore wrote of his 1938 \"Stringed Mother and Child\": \"Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the Science Museum ... I was fascinated by the mathematical models I saw there ... It wasn't the scientific study of these models but the ability to look through the strings as with a bird cage and to see one form within another which excited me.\"\n\nThe artists Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian founded the De Stijl movement, which they wanted to \"establish a visual vocabulary elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline\". Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture. After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the Avant-garde Art Concret movement, describing his 1929–1930 \"Arithmetic Composition\", a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as \"a structure that can be controlled, a \"definite\" surface without chance elements or individual caprice\", yet \"not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not ... empty as there is \"everything\" which fits the internal rhythm\". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.\n\nThe mathematics of tessellation, polyhedra, shaping of space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist M. C. Escher (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts. In the \"Alhambra Sketch\", Escher showed that art can be created with polygons or regular shapes such as triangles, squares, and hexagons. Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, glide reflections, and translations to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's \"Ascending and Descending\" is based on the \"impossible staircase\" created by the medical scientist Lionel Penrose and his son the mathematician Roger Penrose.\n\nSome of Escher's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter on hyperbolic geometry. Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The Platonic solids—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in \"Order and Chaos\" and \"Four Regular Solids\". These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.\n\nThe visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks. Stewart Coffin makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods; George W. Hart works on the theory of polyhedra and sculpts objects inspired by them; Magnus Wenninger makes \"especially beautiful\" models of complex stellated polyhedra.\n\nThe distorted perspectives of anamorphosis have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when Hans Holbein the Younger incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting \"The Ambassadors\". Many artists since then, including Escher, have make use of anamorphic tricks.\n\nThe mathematics of topology has inspired several artists in modern times. The sculptor John Robinson (1935–2007) created works such as \"Gordian Knot\" and \"Bands of Friendship\", displaying knot theory in polished bronze. Other works by Robinson explore the topology of toruses. \"Genesis\" is based on Borromean rings – a set of three circles, no two of which link but in which the whole structure cannot be taken apart without breaking. The sculptor Helaman Ferguson creates complex surfaces and other topological objects. His works are visual representations of mathematical objects; \"The Eightfold Way\" is based on the projective special linear group PSL(2,7), a finite group of 168 elements. The sculptor Bathsheba Grossman similarly bases her work on mathematical structures.\n\nA liberal arts inquiry project examines connections between mathematics and art through the Möbius strip, flexagons, origami and panorama photography.\n\nMathematical objects including the Lorenz manifold and the hyperbolic plane have been crafted using fiber arts including crochet. The American weaver Ada Dietz wrote a 1949 monograph \"Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles\", defining weaving patterns based on the expansion of multivariate polynomials. The mathematician J. C. P. Miller used the Rule 90 cellular automaton to design tapestries depicting both trees and abstract patterns of triangles. The \"mathekniticians\" Pat Ashforth and Steve Plummer use knitted versions of mathematical objects such as hexaflexagons in their teaching, though their Menger sponge proved too troublesome to knit and was made of plastic canvas instead. Their \"mathghans\" (Afghans for Schools) project introduced knitting into the British mathematics and technology curriculum.\n\nModelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's \"Stefaneschi Triptych\", 1320, illustrates recursion in the form of \"mise en abyme\"; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering. Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings such as his 1917 \"Great Metaphysical Interior\" explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.\n\nArt can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some paintings by the surrealist René Magritte, which can be read as semiotic jokes about confusion between levels. In \"La condition humaine\" (1933), Magritte depicts an easel (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by \"real\" curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's \"Print Gallery\" (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which recursively contains the picture, and so \"ad infinitum\". Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 \"Mental Arithmetic\" as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized. \"The Guardian\" observed that the \"eerie toytown image\" prophesied Modernism's usurpation of \"cosy traditional forms\", but also plays with the human tendency to seek patterns in nature.\n\nSalvador Dalí's last painting, \"The Swallow's Tail\" (1983), was part of a series inspired by René Thom's catastrophe theory. The Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Palazuelo (1916–2007) focused on the investigation of form. He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as \"Angular I\" and \"Automnes\", Palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations.\n\nThe artist Adrian Gray practises stone balancing, exploiting friction and the centre of gravity to create striking and seemingly impossible compositions.\n\nArtists, however, do not necessarily take geometry literally. As Douglas Hofstadter writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\", by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: \"The difference between an Escher drawing and non-Euclidean geometry is that in the latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one stares at the pictures.\" Hofstadter discusses the seemingly paradoxical lithograph \"Print Gallery\" by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a \"strange loop, or tangled hierarchy\" to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical. The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and Hendrik Lenstra, who propose that it could contain a Droste effect copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.\n\nAlgorithmic analysis of images of artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.\nJackson Pollock's drip painting style has a definite fractal dimension; among the artists who may have influenced Pollock's controlled chaos, Max Ernst painted Lissajous figures directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.\n\nThe computer scientist Neil Dodgson investigated whether Bridget Riley's stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically, concluding that while separation distance could \"provide some characterisation\" and global entropy worked on some paintings, autocorrelation failed as Riley's patterns were irregular. Local entropy worked best, and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert Kudielka.\n\nThe American mathematician George Birkhoff's 1933 \"Aesthetic Measure\" proposes a quantitative metric of the aesthetic quality of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but is limited to the \"elements of order\" of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, \"O\", takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, \"C\", counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as \"O/C\". This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.\n\nArt has sometimes stimulated the development of mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research that led to the work of Brook Taylor and Johann Heinrich Lambert on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing, and ultimately to the mathematics of projective geometry of Girard Desargues and Jean-Victor Poncelet.\n\nThe Japanese paper-folding art of origami has been reworked mathematically by Tomoko Fusé using modules, congruent pieces of paper such as squares, and making them into polyhedra or tilings. Paper-folding was used in 1893 by T. Sundara Rao in his \"Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding\" to demonstrate geometrical proofs. The mathematics of paper folding has been explored in Maekawa's theorem, Kawasaki's theorem, and the Huzita–Hatori axioms.\n\nOptical illusions such as the Fraser spiral strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception, creating what the art historian Ernst Gombrich called a \"baffling trick.\" The black and white ropes that appear to form spirals are in fact concentric circles. The mid-twentieth century Op art or optical art style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in the work of artists such as Bridget Riley, Spyros Horemis, and Victor Vasarely.\n\nA strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. Plutarch attributed the belief to Plato, writing that \"Plato said God geometrizes continually\" (\"Convivialium disputationum\", liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the regular or Platonic solids dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art. A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: \"When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the deep\" (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses. In 1596, the mathematical astronomer Johannes Kepler modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets. William Blake's \"Ancient of Days\" and his painting of the physicist Isaac Newton, naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world, as in a different way does Salvador Dalí's 1954 \"Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)\", which depicts the cross as a hypercube, representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three. In Dali's \"The Sacrament of the Last Supper\" (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "83525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83525", "title": "Matriarchy", "text": "Matriarchy\n\nMatriarchy is a social system in which females (most notably in mammals) hold the primary power positions in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property at the specific exclusion of males — at least to a large degree.\n\nWhile those definitions apply in general English, definitions specific to the disciplines of anthropology and feminism differ in some respects. Most anthropologists hold that there are no known anthropological societies \"that are unambiguously matriarchal\", but some authors believe exceptions may exist or may have.\n\nMatriarchies may also be confused with matrilineal, matrilocal, and matrifocal societies. A few people consider any non-patriarchal system to be matriarchal, thus including genderally equalitarian systems (Peggy Reeves Sanday favors redefining and reintroducing the word matriarchy, especially in reference to contemporary matrilineal societies such as the Minangkabau), but most academics exclude them from matriarchies strictly defined.\n\nIn 19th-century Western scholarship, the hypothesis of matriarchy representing an early, mainly prehistoric, stage of human development gained popularity. Possibilities of so-called primitive societies were cited and the hypothesis survived into the 20th century, including in the context of second-wave feminism. This hypothesis was criticized by some authors such as Cynthia Eller in \"The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory\" and remains as a largely unsolved question to this day. Some older myths describe matriarchies.\n\nSeveral modern feminists have advocated for matriarchy now or in the future and it has appeared in feminist literature. In several theologies, matriarchy has been portrayed as negative.\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\"), matriarchy is a \"form of social organization in which the mother or oldest female is the head of the family, and descent and relationship are reckoned through the female line; government or rule by a woman or women.\" A popular definition, according to James Peoples and Garrick Bailey, is \"female dominance\". Within the academic discipline of cultural anthropology, according to the \"OED\", matriarchy is a \"culture or community in which such a system prevails\" or a \"family, society, organization, etc., dominated by a woman or women.\" In general anthropology, according to William A. Haviland, matriarchy is \"rule by women\". A matriarchy is a society in which females, especially mothers, have the central roles of political leadership, moral authority, and control of property, but does not include a society that occasionally is led by a female for nonmatriarchal reasons or an occupation in which females generally predominate without reference to matriarchy, such as prostitution or women's auxiliaries of organizations run by men. According to Lawrence A. Kuzner in 1997, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown argued in 1924 that the definitions of matriarchy and patriarchy had \"logical and empirical failings ... [and] were too vague to be scientifically useful\".\n\nMost academics exclude egalitarian nonpatriarchal systems from matriarchies more strictly defined. According to Heide Göttner-Abendroth, a reluctance to accept the existence of matriarchies might be based on a specific culturally biased notion of how to define matriarchy: because in a patriarchy men rule over women, a matriarchy has frequently been conceptualized as women ruling over men, while she believed that matriarchies are egalitarian.\nThe word matriarchy, for a society politically led by females, especially mothers, who also control property, is often interpreted to mean the genderal opposite of patriarchy, but it is not an opposite. According to Peoples and Bailey, the view of anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday is that matriarchies are not a mirror form of patriarchies but rather that a matriarchy \"emphasizes maternal meanings where 'maternal symbols are linked to social practices influencing the lives of both sexes and where women play a central role in these practices. Journalist Margot Adler wrote, \"literally, ... [\"matriarchy\"] means government by mothers, or more broadly, government and power in the hands of women.\" Barbara Love and Elizabeth Shanklin wrote, \"by 'matriarchy,' we mean a non-alienated society: a society in which women, those who produce the next generation, define motherhood, determine the conditions of motherhood, and determine the environment in which the next generation is reared.\" According to Cynthia Eller, \"'matriarchy' can be thought of ... as a shorthand description for any society in which women's power is equal or superior to men's and in which the culture centers around values and life events described as 'feminine.'\" Eller wrote that the idea of matriarchy mainly rests on two pillars, romanticism and modern social criticism. The notion of matriarchy was meant to describe something like a utopia placed in the past in order to legitimate contemporary social criticism. With respect to a prehistoric matriarchal Golden Age, according to Barbara Epstein, \"matriarchy ... means a social system organized around matriliny and goddess worship in which women have positions of power.\" According to Adler, in the Marxist tradition, it usually refers to a pre-class society \"where women and men share equally in production and power.\"\n\nAccording to Adler, \"a number of feminists note that few definitions of the word [matriarchy], despite its literal meaning, include any concept of power, and they suggest that centuries of oppression have made it impossible for women to conceive of themselves with such power.\"\n\nMatriarchy has often been presented as negative, in contrast to patriarchy as natural and inevitable for society, thus that matriarchy is hopeless. Love and Shanklin wrote:\nWhen we hear the word \"matriarchy\", we are conditioned to a number of responses: that matriarchy refers to the past and that matriarchies have never existed; that matriarchy is a hopeless fantasy of female domination, of mothers dominating children, of women being cruel to men. Conditioning us negatively to matriarchy is, of course, in the interests of patriarchs. We are made to feel that patriarchy is natural; we are less likely to question it, and less likely to direct our energies to ending it.\n\nThe Matriarchal Studies school led by Göttner-Abendroth calls for an even more inclusive redefinition of the term: Göttner-Abendroth defines \"Modern Matriarchal Studies\" as the \"investigation and presentation of non-patriarchal societies\", effectively defining matriarchy as non-patriarchy. She has also defined matriarchy as characterized by the sharing of power equally between the two genders. According to Diane LeBow, \"matriarchal societies are often described as ... egalitarian ...\", although anthropologist Ruby Rohrlich has written of \"the centrality of women in an egalitarian society.\"\n\nMatriarchy is also the public formation in which the woman occupies the ruling position in a family. For this usage, some scholars now prefer the term matrifocal to matriarchal. Some, including Daniel Moynihan, claimed that there is a matriarchy among Black families in the United States, because a quarter of them were headed by single women; thus, families composing a substantial minority of a substantial minority could be enough for the latter to constitute a matriarchy within a larger non-matriarchal society.\n\nEtymologically, it is from Latin \"māter\" (genitive \"mātris\"), \"mother\" and Greek ἄρχειν \"arkhein\", \"to rule\". The notion of matriarchy was defined by Joseph-François Lafitau (1681–1746), who first named it \"ginécocratie\". According to the \"OED\", the earliest known attestation of the word matriarchy is in 1885. By contrast, gynæcocracy, meaning 'rule of women', has been in use since the 17th century, building on the Greek word found in Aristotle and Plutarch.\n\nTerms with similar etymology are also used in various social sciences and humanities to describe matriarchal or \"matriological\" aspects of social, cultural and political processes. Adjective \"matriological\" is derived from the noun \"matriology\" that comes from Latin word \"māter\" (mother) and Greek word λογος (\"logos\", teaching about). The term matriology was used in theology and history of religion as a designation for the study of particular motherly aspects of various female deities. The term was subsequently borrowed by other social sciences and humanities and its meaning was widened in order to describe and define particular female-dominated and female-centered aspects of cultural and social life. The male alternative for matriology is patriology, with patriarchy being the male alternative to matriarchy.\n\nIn their works, Johann Jakob Bachofen and Lewis Morgan used such terms and expressions as \"mother-right\", \"female rule\", \"gyneocracy\", and \"female authority\". All these terms meant the same: the rule by females (mother or wife). Although Bachofen and Lewis Morgan confined the \"mother right\" inside households, it was the basis of female influence upon the whole society. The authors of the classics did not think that \"gyneocracy\" meant 'female government' in politics. They were aware of the fact that the sexual structure of government had no relation to domestic rule and to roles of both sexes.\n\nA matriarchy is also sometimes called a \"gynarchy\", a \"gynocracy\", a \"gynecocracy\", or a \"gynocentric\" society, although these terms do not definitionally emphasize motherhood. Cultural anthropologist Jules de Leeuwe argued that some societies were \"mainly \"gynecocratic\"\" (others being \"mainly \"androcratic\"\").\n\nGynecocracy, gynaecocracy, gynocracy, gyneocracy, and gynarchy generally mean 'government by women over women and men'. All of these words are synonyms in their most important definitions. While these words all share that principal meaning, they differ a little in their additional meanings, so that \"gynecocracy\" also means 'women's social supremacy', \"gynaecocracy\" also means 'government by one woman', 'female dominance', and, derogatorily, 'petticoat government', and \"gynocracy\" also means 'women as the ruling class'. \"Gyneocracy\" is rarely used in modern times. None of these definitions are limited to mothers.\n\nSome question whether a queen ruling without a king is sufficient to constitute female government, given the amount of participation of other men in most such governments. One view is that it is sufficient. \"By the end of [Queen] Elizabeth's reign, gynecocracy was a \"fait accompli\"\", according to historian Paula Louise Scalingi. Gynecocracy is defined by Scalingi as \"government by women\", similar to dictionary definitions (one dictionary adding 'women's social supremacy' to the governing role). Scalingi reported arguments for and against the validity of gynocracy and said, \"the humanists treated the question of female rule as part of the larger controversy over sexual equality.\" Possibly, queenship, because of the power wielded by men in leadership and assisting a queen, leads to queen bee syndrome, contributing to the difficulty of other women in becoming heads of the government.\n\nSome matriarchies have been described by historian Helen Diner as \"a strong gynocracy\" and \"women monopolizing government\" and she described matriarchal Amazons as \"an extreme, feminist wing\" of humanity and that North African women \"ruled the country politically,\" and, according to Adler, Diner \"envision[ed] a dominance matriarchy\".\n\nGynocentrism is the 'dominant or exclusive focus on women', is opposed to androcentrism, and \"invert[s] ... the privilege of the ... [male/female] binary ...[,] [some feminists] arguing for 'the superiority of values embodied in traditionally female experience'\".\n\nSome people who sought evidence for the existence of a matriarchy often mixed matriarchy with anthropological terms and concepts describing specific arrangements in the field of family relationships and the organization of family life, such as matrilineality and matrilocality. These terms refer to intergenerational relationships (as matriarchy may), but do not distinguish between males and females insofar as they apply to specific arrangements for sons as well as daughters from the perspective of their relatives on their mother's side. Accordingly, these concepts do not represent matriarchy as 'power of women over men'.\n\nAnthropologists have begun to use the term matrifocality. There is some debate concerning the terminological delineation between \"matrifocality\" and \"matriarchy\". Matrifocal societies are those in which women, especially mothers, occupy a central position. Anthropologist R. T. Smith refers to \"matrifocality\" as the kinship structure of a social system whereby the mothers assume structural prominence. The term does not necessarily imply domination by women or mothers. In addition, some authors depart from the premise of a mother-child dyad as the core of a human group where the grandmother was the central ancestor with her children and grandchildren clustered around her in an extended family.\n\nThe term matricentric means 'having a mother as head of the family or household'.\nMatristic: Feminist scholars and archeologists such as Marija Gimbutas, Gerda Lerner, and Riane Eisler label their notion of a \"woman-centered\" society surrounding Mother Goddess worship during prehistory (in Paleolithic and Neolithic Europe) and in ancient civilizations by using the term \"matristic\" rather than \"matriarchal.\" Marija Gimbutas states that she uses \"the term matristic simply to avoid the term matriarchy with the understanding that it incorporates matriliny.\"\n\nMatrilineality, in which descent is traced through the female line, is sometimes conflated with historical matriarchy. Sanday favors redefining and reintroducing the word \"matriarchy\", especially in reference to contemporary matrilineal societies such as the Minangkabau. The 19th-century belief that matriarchal societies existed was due to the transmission of \"economic and social power ... through kinship lines\" so that \"in a matrilineal society all power would be channeled through women. Women may not have retained all power and authority in such societies ..., but they would have been in a position to control and dispense power.\"\n\nA matrilocal society defines a society in which a couple resides close to the bride's family rather than the bridegroom's family.\n\nMost anthropologists hold that there are no known societies that are unambiguously matriarchal. According to J. M. Adovasio, Olga Soffer, and Jake Page, no true matriarchy is known actually to have existed. Anthropologist Joan Bamberger argued that the historical record contains no primary sources on any society in which women dominated. Anthropologist Donald Brown's list of human cultural universals (\"viz.\", features shared by nearly all current human societies) includes men being the \"dominant element\" in public political affairs, which he asserts is the contemporary opinion of mainstream anthropology. There are some disagreements and possible exceptions. A belief that women's rule preceded men's rule was, according to Haviland, \"held by many nineteenth-century intellectuals\". The hypothesis survived into the 20th century and was notably advanced in the context of feminism and especially second-wave feminism, but the hypothesis is mostly discredited today, most experts saying that it was never true.\n\nMatriarchs, according to Peoples and Bailey, do exist; there are \"individual matriarchs of families and kin groups.\"\n\n\"The Cambridge Ancient History\" (1975) stated that \"the predominance of a supreme goddess is probably a reflection from the practice of matriarchy which at all times characterized Elamite civilization to a greater or lesser degree\".\n\nTacitus claimed in his book \"Germania\" that in \"the nations of the Sitones a woman is the ruling sex.\"\n\nLegends of Amazon women originated not from South America, but rather Scythia (present day Russia).\n\nPossible matriarchies in Burma are, according to Jorgen Bisch, the Padaungs and, according to Andrew Marshall, the Kayaw.\n\nThe Mosuo culture, which is in China near Tibet, is frequently described as matriarchal. The Mosuo themselves often use this description and they believe it increases interest in their culture and thus attracts tourism. The term matrilineal is sometimes used, and, while more accurate, still doesn't reflect the full complexity of their social organization. In fact, it is not easy to categorize Mosuo culture within traditional Western definitions. They have aspects of a matriarchal culture: Women are often the head of the house, inheritance is through the female line, and women make business decisions. However, unlike in a true matriarchy, political power tends to be in the hands of males.\n\nIn India, of communities recognized in the national Constitution as Scheduled Tribes, \"some ... [are] matriarchal and matrilineal\" \"and thus have been known to be more egalitarian\". According to interviewer Anuj Kumar, Manipur, India, \"has a matriarchal society\", but this may not be a scholarly assessment.\n\nNairs in kerala follow matriarchy system. There were times in the 17th century AD when the Queen was the head of the family. The kingdom passed from the king to his sister's son. The Queen is always the king's sister. The head of the family is the eldest irrespective of gender. Refer kings of Travancore.\n\nAnthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday said the Minangkabau society may be a matriarchy.\n\nAccording to William S. Turley, \"the role of women in traditional Vietnamese culture was determined [partly] by ... indigenous customs bearing traces of matriarchy\", affecting \"different social classes\" to \"varying degrees\". According to Peter C. Phan, that \"the first three persons leading insurrections against China were women ... that ancient Vietnam was a matriarchal society\" and \"the ancient Vietnamese family system was most likely matriarchal, with women ruling over the clan or tribe\" until the Vietnamese the patriarchal system introduced by the Chinese\", although \"this patriarchal system ... was not able to dislodge the Vietnamese women from their relatively high position in the family and society, especially among the peasants and the lower classes\", with modern \"culture and legal codes ... [promoting more] rights and privileges\" for women than in Chinese culture. According to Chiricosta, the legend of Âu Cơ is said to be evidence of \"the presence of an original 'matriarchy' in North Vietnam and [it] led to the double kinship system, which developed there ... [and which] combined matrilineal and patrilineal patterns of family structure and assigned equal importance to both lines.\" Chiricosta said that other scholars relied on \"this 'matriarchal' aspect of the myth to differentiate Vietnamese society from the pervasive spread of Chinese Confucian patriarchy\" and that \"resistance to China's colonization of Vietnam ... [combined with] the view that Vietnam was originally a matriarchy ... [led to viewing] women's struggles for liberation from (Chinese) patriarchy as a metaphor for the entire nation's struggle for Vietnamese independence.\" According to Keith Weller Taylor, \"the matriarchal flavor of the time is ... attested by the fact that Trung Trac's mother's tomb and spirit temple have survived, although nothing remains of her father\", and the \"society of the Trung sisters\" was \"strongly matrilineal\". According to Donald M. Seekins, an indication of \"the strength of matriarchal values\" was that a woman, Trưng Trắc, with her younger sister Trưng Nhị, raised an army of \"over 80,000 soldiers ... [in which] many of her officers were women\", with which they defeated the Chinese. According to Seekins, \"in [the year] 40, Trung Trac was proclaimed queen, and a capital was built for her\" and modern Vietnam considers the Trung sisters to be heroines. According to Karen G. Turner, in the 3rd century A.D., Lady Triệu to personify the matriarchal culture that mitigated Confucianized patriarchal norms ... [although] she is also painted as something of a freak ... with her ... savage, violent streak.\"\n\nThe Hopi (in what is now the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona), according to Alice Schlegel, had as its \"gender ideology ... one of female superiority, and it operated within a social actuality of sexual equality.\" According to LeBow (based on Schlegel's work), in the Hopi, \"gender roles ... are egalitarian ... [and] [n]either sex is inferior.\" LeBow concluded that Hopi women \"participate fully in ... political decision-making.\" According to Schlegel, \"the Hopi no longer live as they are described here\" and \"the attitude of female superiority is fading\". Schlegel said the Hopi \"were and still are matrilinial\" and \"the household ... was matrilocal\". Schlegel explains why there was female superiority as that the Hopi believed in \"life as the highest good ... [with] the female principle ... activated in women and in Mother Earth ... as its source\" and that the Hopi \"were not in a state of continual war with equally matched neighbors\" and \"had no standing army\" so that \"the Hopi lacked the spur to masculine superiority\" and, within that, as that women were central to institutions of clan and household and predominated \"within the economic and social systems (in contrast to male predominance within the political and ceremonial systems)\", the Clan Mother, for example, being empowered to overturn land distribution by men if she felt it was unfair, since there was no \"countervailing ... strongly centralized, male-centered political structure\".\n\nThe Iroquois Confederacy or League, combining 5–6 Native American Haudenosaunee nations or tribes before the U.S. became a nation, operated by The Great Binding Law of Peace, a constitution by which women participated in the League's political decision-making, including deciding whether to proceed to war, through what may have been a matriarchy or gyneocracy. According to Doug George-Kanentiio, in this society, mothers exercise central moral and political roles. The dates of this constitution's operation are unknown; the League was formed in approximately 1000–1450, but the constitution was oral until written in about 1880. The League still exists.\n\nGeorge-Kanentiio explains:\n\nIn our society, women are the center of all things. Nature, we believe, has given women the ability to create; therefore it is only natural that women be in positions of power to protect this function...We traced our clans through women; a child born into the world assumed the clan membership of its mother. Our young women were expected to be physically strong...The young women received formal instruction in traditional planting...Since the Iroquois were absolutely dependent upon the crops they grew, whoever controlled this vital activity wielded great power within our communities. It was our belief that since women were the givers of life they naturally regulated the feeding of our people...In all countries, real wealth stems from the control of land and its resources. Our Iroquois philosophers knew this as well as we knew natural law. To us it made sense for women to control the land since they were far more sensitive to the rhythms of the Mother Earth. We did not own the land but were custodians of it. Our women decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used...In our political system, we mandated full equality. Our leaders were selected by a caucus of women before the appointments were subject to popular review...Our traditional governments are composed of an equal number of men and women. The men are chiefs and the women clan-mothers...As leaders, the women closely monitor the actions of the men and retain the right to veto any law they deem inappropriate...Our women not only hold the reigns of political and economic power, they also have the right to determine all issues involving the taking of human life. Declarations of war had to be approved by the women, while treaties of peace were subject to their deliberations.\n\nThe controversy surrounding prehistoric or \"primal\" matriarchy began in reaction to the book by Bachofen, \"Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World\", in 1861. Several generations of ethnologists were inspired by his pseudo-evolutionary theory of archaic matriarchy. Following him and Jane Ellen Harrison, several generations of scholars, usually arguing from known myths or oral traditions and examination of Neolithic female cult-figures, suggested that many ancient societies might have been matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware. According to Uwe Wesel, Bachofen's myth interpretations have proved to be untenable. The concept was further investigated by Lewis Morgan. Many researchers studied the phenomenon of matriarchy afterward, but the basis was laid by the classics of sociology. The notion of a \"woman-centered\" society was developed by Bachofen, whose three-volume \"Myth, Religion, and Mother Right\" (1861) impacted the way classicists such as Harrison, Arthur Evans, Walter Burkert, and James Mellaart looked at the evidence of matriarchal religion in pre-Hellenic societies. According to historian Susan Mann, as of 2000, \"few scholars these days find ... [a \"notion of a stage of primal matriarchy\"] persuasive.\"\n\nThe following excerpts from Lewis Morgan's \"Ancient Society\" will explain the use of the terms: \"In a work of vast research, Bachofen has collected and discussed the evidence of female authority, mother-right, and of female rule, gynecocracy.\" \"Common lands and joint tillage would lead to joint-tenant houses and communism in living; so that gyneocracy seems to require for its creation, descent in the female line. Women thus entrenched in large households, supplied from common stores, in which their own gens so largely predominated in numbers, would produce the phenomena of mother right and gyneocracy, which Bachofen has detected and traced with the aid of fragments of history and of tradition.\"\n\nKurt Derungs is a non-academic author advocating an \"anthropology of landscape\" based on allegedly matriarchal traces in toponymy and folklore.\n\nFriedrich Engels, in 1884, claimed that, in the earliest stages of human social development, there was group marriage and that therefore paternity was disputable, whereas maternity was not, so that a family could be traced only through the female line, and claimed that this was connected with the dominance of women over men or a \"Mutterrecht\", which notion Engels took from Bachofen, who claimed, based on his interpretations of myths, that myths reflected a memory of a time when women dominated over men. Engels speculated that the domestication of animals increased wealth claimed by men. Engels said that men wanted control over women for use as laborers and because they wanted to pass on their wealth to their children, requiring monogamy. Engels did not explain how this could happen in a matriarchal society, but said that women's status declined until they became mere objects in the exchange trade between men and patriarchy was established, causing the global defeat of the female sex and the rise of individualism, competition, and dedication to achievement. According to Eller, Engels may have been influenced with respect to women's status by August Bebel, according to whom this matriarchy resulted in communism while patriarchy did not.\n\nAustrian writer Bertha Diener, also known as Helen Diner, wrote \"Mothers and Amazons\" (1930), which was the first work to focus on women's cultural history. Hers is regarded as a classic of feminist matriarchal study. Her view is that in the past all human societies were matriarchal; then, at some point, most shifted to patriarchal and degenerated. The controversy was reinforced further by the publication of \"The White Goddess\" by Robert Graves (1948) and his later analysis of classical Greek mythology and the vestiges of earlier myths that had been rewritten after a profound change in the religion of Greek civilization that occurred within its very early historical times. From the 1950s, Marija Gimbutas developed a theory of an \"Old European culture\" in Neolithic Europe which had matriarchal traits, replaced by the patriarchal system of the Proto-Indo-Europeans with the spread of Indo-European languages beginning in the Bronze Age. According to Epstein, anthropologists in the 20th century said that \"the goddess worship or matrilocality that evidently existed in many paleolithic societies was not necessarily associated with matriarchy in the sense of women's power over men. Many societies can be found that exhibit those qualities along with female subordination.\" From the 1970s, these ideas were taken up by popular writers of second-wave feminism and expanded with the speculations of Margaret Murray on witchcraft, by the Goddess movement, and in feminist Wicca, as well as in works by Eisler, Elizabeth Gould Davis, and Merlin Stone.\n\n\"A Golden Age of matriarchy\" was, according to Epstein, prominently presented by Charlene Spretnak and \"encouraged\" by Stone and Eisler, but, at least for the Neolithic Age, has been denounced as feminist wishful thinking in \"The Inevitability of Patriarchy\", \"Why Men Rule\", \"Goddess Unmasked\", and \"The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory\" and is not emphasized in third-wave feminism. According to Eller, Gimbutas had a large part in constructing a myth of historical matriarchy by examining Eastern European cultures that she asserts, by and large, never really bore any resemblance in character to the alleged universal matriarchy suggested by Gimbutas and Graves. She asserts that in \"actually documented primitive societies\" of recent (historical) times, paternity is never ignored and that the sacred status of goddesses does not automatically increase female social status, and believes that this affirms that utopian matriarchy is simply an inversion of antifeminism.\n\nJ.F. del Giorgio insists on a matrifocal, matrilocal, matrilineal Paleolithic society.\n\nAccording to Rohrlich, \"many scholars are convinced that Crete was a matriarchy, ruled by a queen-priestess\" and the \"Cretan civilization\" was \"matriarchal\" before \"1500 B.C.,\" when it was overrun and colonized.\n\nAlso according to Rohrlich, \"in the early Sumerian city-states 'matriarchy seems to have left something more than a trace.\n\nOne common misconception among historians of the Bronze Age such as Stone and Eisler is the notion that the Semites were matriarchal while the Indo-Europeans practiced a patriarchal system. An example of this view is found in Stone's \"When God Was a Woman\", wherein she makes the case that the worship of Yahweh was an Indo-European invention superimposed on an ancient matriarchal Semitic nation. Evidence from the Amorites and pre-Islamic Arabs, however, indicates that the primitive Semitic family was in fact patriarchal and patrilineal.\n\nHowever, not all scholars agree. Anthropologist and Biblical scholar Raphael Patai writes in The Hebrew Goddess that the Jewish religion, far from being pure monotheism, contained from earliest times strong polytheistic elements, chief of which was the cult of Asherah, the mother goddess. A story in the Biblical Book of Judges places the worship of Asherah in the 12th century B.C.E. Originally a Canaanite goddess, her worship was adopted by Hebrews who intermarried with Canaanites. She was worshipped in public and was represented by carved wooden poles. Numerous small nude female figurines of clay were found all over ancient Palestine and a 7th C. Hebrew text invokes her aid for a woman giving birth.\n\nShekinah is the name of the feminine holy spirit who embodies both divine radiance and compassion. She comforts the sick and dejected, accompanies the Jews whenever they are exiled, and intercedes with God to exercise mercy rather than to inflict retribution on sinners. While not a creation of the Hebrew Bible, Shekinah appears in a slightly later Aramaic translation of the Bible in the first or second century C.E., according to Patai. Initially portrayed as the presence of God, she later becomes distinct from God, taking on more physical attributes.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indo-Europeans were known to have practiced multiple succession systems, and there is much better evidence of matrilineal customs among the Indo-European Celts and Germans than among any ancient Semitic peoples.\n\nWomen were running Sparta while the men were often away fighting. Gorgo, Queen of Sparta, was asked by a woman in Attica something along the lines of, \"why are Spartan women the only women in the world who could rule men?\" Gorgo replied, \"Because we are the only women who are mothers of men.\"\n\nArising in the period ranging from the Iron Age to the Middle Ages, several early northwestern European mythologies from the Irish (\"e.g.\", Macha and Scáthach), the Brittonic (\"e.g.\", Rhiannon), and the Germanic (\"e.g.\", Grendel's mother and Nerthus) contain ambiguous episodes of primal female power which have been interpreted as folk evidence of a real potential for matriarchal attitudes in pre-Christian European Iron Age societies. Often transcribed from a retrospective, patriarchal, Romanised, and Catholic perspective, they hint at an earlier, culturally disturbing, era when female power could have predominated. The first-century–attested historic British figure of Boudicca indicates that Brittonnic society permitted explicit female autocracy or a form of gender equality in a form which contrasted strongly with the patriarchal structure of Mediterranean civilisation.\n\nIn 1995, in Kenya, according to Emily Wax, Umoja, a village only for women from one tribe with about 36 residents, was established under a matriarch. Men of the same tribe established a village nearby from which to observe the women's village, the men's leader objecting to the matriarch's questioning the culture and men suing to close the women's village. The village was still operational in 2005 when Wax reported on it.\n\nSpokespersons for various indigenous peoples at the United Nations and elsewhere have highlighted the central role of women in their societies, referring to them as matriarchies, or as matriarchal in character.\n\nMatriarchy may also refer to non-human animal species in which females hold higher status and hierarchical positions, such as among lions, elephants, and bonobos.\n\nA legendary matriarchy related by several writers was Amazon society. According to Phyllis Chesler, \"in Amazon societies, women were ... mothers and their society's only political and religious leaders\", as well as the only warriors and hunters; \"queens were elected\" and apparently \"any woman could aspire to and achieve full human expression.\" Herodotus reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their females observed their ancient maternal customs, \"frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men\". Moreover, said Herodotus, \"no girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle\". Amazons came to play a role in Roman historiography. Julius Caesar spoke of the conquest of large parts of Asia by Semiramis and the Amazons. Although Strabo was sceptical about their historicity, the Amazons were taken as historical throughout late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers spoke of the Amazons as a real people. Medieval authors continued a tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, Adam of Bremen placing them at the Baltic Sea and Paulus Diaconus in the heart of Germania.\n\nRobert Graves suggested that a myth displaced earlier myths that had to change when a major cultural change brought patriarchy to replace a matriarchy. According to this myth, in Greek mythology, Zeus is said to have swallowed his pregnant lover, the titan goddess Metis, who was carrying their daughter, Athena. The mother and child created havoc inside Zeus. Either Hermes or Hephaestus split Zeus's head, allowing Athena, in full battle armor, to burst forth from his forehead. Athena was thus described as being \"born\" from Zeus. The outcome pleased Zeus as it didn't fulfill the prophecy of Themis which (according to Aeschylus) predicted that Zeus will one day bear a son that would overthrow him. \n\nAccording to Adler, \"there \"is\" plenty of evidence of ancient societies where women held greater power than in many societies today. For example, Jean Markale's studies of Celtic societies show that the power of women was reflected not only in myth and legend but in legal codes pertaining to marriage, divorce, property ownership, and the right to rule.\"\n\nBamberger (1974) examines several matriarchal myths from South American cultures and concludes that portraying the women from this matriarchal period as immoral often serves to restrain contemporary women in these societies. \n\nWhile \"matriarchy\" has mostly fallen out of use for the anthropological description of existing societies, it remains current as a concept in feminism.\nIn first-wave feminist discourse, either Elizabeth Cady Stanton or Margaret Fuller (it is unclear who was first) introduced the concept of matriarchy and the discourse was joined in by Matilda Joslyn Gage. Victoria Woodhull, in 1871, called for men to open the U.S. government to women or a new constitution and government would be formed in a year; and, on a basis of equality, she ran to be elected President in 1872. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in 1911 and 1914, argued for \"a woman-centered, or better mother-centered, world\" and described government by women. She argued that a government led by either sex must be assisted by the other, both genders being \"useful ... and should in our governments be alike used\", because men and women have different qualities.\n\nCultural feminism includes \"matriarchal worship\", according to Prof. James Penner.\n\nIn feminist literature, matriarchy and patriarchy are not conceived as simple mirrors of each other. While \"matriarchy\" sometimes means \"the political rule of women\", that meaning is often rejected, on the ground that matriarchy is not a mirroring of patriarchy. Patriarchy is held to be about power over others while matriarchy is held to be about power from within, Starhawk having written on that distinction and Adler having argued that matriarchal power is not possessive and not controlling, but is harmonious with nature.\n\nFor radical feminists, the importance of matriarchy is that \"veneration for the female principle ... somewhat lightens an oppressive system.\"\n\nFeminist utopias are a form of advocacy. According to Tineke Willemsen, \"a feminist utopia would ... be the description of a place where at least women would like to live.\" Willemsen continues, among \"type[s] of feminist utopias[,] ... [one] stem[s] from feminists who emphasize the differences between women and men. They tend to formulate their ideal world in terms of a society where women's positions are better than men's. There are various forms of matriarchy, or even a utopia that resembles the Greek myth of the Amazons... [V]ery few modern utopias have been developed in which women are absolute autocrats.\"\n\nA minority of feminists, generally radical, have argued that women should govern societies of women and men. In all of these advocacies, the governing women are not limited to mothers:\n\nSome such advocacies are informed by work on past matriarchy:\n\n\nSome fiction caricatured the current gender hierarchy by describing a matriarchal alternative without advocating for it. According to Karin Schönpflug, \"Gerd Brantenberg's \"Egalia's Daughters\" is a caricature of powered gender relations which have been completely reversed, with the female sex on the top and the male sex a degraded, oppressed group\"; \"gender inequality is expressed through power inversion\" and \"all gender roles are reversed and women rule over a class of intimidated, effeminate men\". \"\"Egalia\" is not a typical example of gender inequality in the sense that a vision of a desirable matriarchy is created; \"Egalia\" is more a caricature of male hegemony by twisting gender hierarchy but not really offering a 'better world.\n\nOn egalitarian matriarchy, Heide Göttner-Abendroth's International Academy for Modern Matriarchal Studies and Matriarchal Spirituality (HAGIA) organized conferences in Luxembourg in 2003 and Texas in 2005, with papers published. Göttner-Abendroth argued that \"matriarchies are all egalitarian at least in terms of gender—they have no gender hierarchy ... [, that, f]or many matriarchal societies, the social order is completely egalitarian at both local and regional levels\", that, \"for our own path toward new egalitarian societies, we can gain ... insight from ... [\"tested\"] matriarchal patterns\", and that \"matriarchies are not abstract \"utopias\", constructed according to philosophical concepts that could never be implemented.\"\n\nAccording to Eller, \"a deep distrust of men's ability to adhere to\" future matriarchal requirements may invoke a need \"to retain at least some degree of female hegemony to insure against a return to patriarchal control\", \"feminists ... [having] the understanding that female dominance is better for society—and better for men—than the present world order\", as is equalitarianism. On the other hand, Eller continued, if men can be trusted to accept equality, probably most feminists seeking future matriarchy would accept an equalitarian model.\n\n\"Demographic[ally]\", \"feminist matriarchalists run the gamut\" but primarily are \"in white, well-educated, middle-class circles\"; many of the adherents are \"religiously inclined\" while others are \"quite secular\".\n\nBiology as a ground for holding either males or females superior over the other has been criticized as invalid, such as by Andrea Dworkin and by Robin Morgan. A claim that women have unique characteristics that prevent women's assimilation with men has been apparently rejected by Ti-Grace Atkinson. On the other hand, not all advocates based their arguments on biology or essentialism.\n\nA criticism by Mansfield of choosing who governs according to gender or sex is that the best qualified people should be chosen, regardless of gender or sex. On the other hand, Mansfield considered merit insufficient for office, because a legal right granted by a sovereign (\"e.g.\", a king), was more important than merit.\n\nDiversity within a proposed community can, according to Becki L. Ross, make it especially challenging to complete forming the community. However, some advocacy includes diversity, in the views of Dworkin and Farley.\n\nProf. Christine Stansell, a feminist, wrote that, for feminists to achieve state power, women must democratically cooperate with men. \"Women must take their place with a new generation of brothers in a struggle for the world's fortunes. Herland, whether of virtuous matrons or daring sisters, is not an option... [T]he well-being and liberty of women cannot be separated from democracy's survival.\" (\"Herland\" was feminist utopian fiction by Charlotte Perkins Gilman in 1911, featuring a community entirely of women except for three men who seek it out, strong women in a matriarchal utopia expected to last for generations, although Charlotte Perkins Gilman was herself a feminist advocate of society being gender-integrated and of women's freedom.)\n\nOther criticisms of superiority are that it is reverse sexism or discriminatory against men, it is opposed by most people including most feminists, women do not want such a position, governing takes women away from family responsibilities, women are too likely to be unable to serve politically because of menstruation and pregnancy, public affairs are too sordid for women and would cost women their respect and femininity (apparently including fertility), superiority is not traditional, women lack the political capacity and authority men have, it is impractical because of a shortage of women with the ability to govern at that level of difficulty as well as the desire and ability to wage war, women are less aggressive, or less often so, than are men and politics is aggressive, women legislating would not serve men's interests or would serve only petty interests, it is contradicted by current science on genderal differences, it is unnatural, and, in the views of a playwright and a novelist, \"women cannot govern on their own.\" On the other hand, another view is that \"women have 'empire' over men\" because of nature and \"men ... are actually obeying\" women.\n\nPursuing a future matriarchy would tend to risk sacrificing feminists' position in present social arrangements, and many feminists are not willing to take that chance, according to Eller. \"Political feminists tend to regard discussions of what utopia would look like as a good way of setting themselves up for disappointment\", according to Eller, and argue that immediate political issues must get the highest priority.\n\n\"Matriarchists\", as typified by comic character Wonder Woman were criticized by Kathie Sarachild, Carol Hanisch, and some others.\n\nSome theologies and theocracies limit or forbid women from being in civil government or public leadership or forbid them from voting, effectively criticizing and forbidding matriarchy. Within none of the following religions is the respective view necessarily universally held:\n\n\nFeminist thealogy, according to Eller, conceptualized humanity as beginning with \"female-ruled or equalitarian societies\", until displaced by patriarchies, and that in the millennial future gynocentric,' life-loving values\" will return to prominence. This, according to Eller, produces \"a virtually infinite number of years of female equality or superiority coming both at the beginning and end of historical time\".\n\nAmong criticisms is that a future matriarchy, according to Eller, as a reflection of spirituality, is conceived as ahistorical, and thus may be unrealistic, unreachable, or even meaningless as a goal to secular feminists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1034339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1034339", "title": "Most recent common ancestor", "text": "Most recent common ancestor\n\nIn biology and genealogy, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA, also last common ancestor (LCA), or concestor) of any set of organisms is the most recent individual from which all the organisms are directly descended. The term is also used in reference to the ancestry of groups of genes (haplotypes) rather than organisms.\n\nThe MRCA of a set of individuals can sometimes be determined by referring to an established pedigree. However, in general, it is impossible to identify the exact MRCA of a large set of individuals, but an estimate of the time at which the MRCA lived can often be given. Such \"time to most recent common ancestor\" (\"TMRCA\") estimates can be given based on DNA test results and established mutation rates as practiced in genetic genealogy, or by reference to a non-genetic, mathematical model or computer simulation. \n\nIn organisms using sexual reproduction, the \"matrilinear MRCA\" and \"patrilinear MRCA\" are the MRCAs of a given population considering only matrilineal and patrilineal descent, respectively. The MRCA of a population by definition cannot be older than either its matrilinear or its patrilinear MRCA.\nIn the case of \"Homo sapiens\", the matrilinear and patrilinear MRCA are also known as \"Mitochondrial Eve\" (mt-MRCA) and \"Y-chromosomal Adam\" (Y-MRCA) respectively.\n\nThe age of the human MRCA is unknown. It is necessarily younger than the age of both Y-MRCA and mt-MRCA, estimated at around 200,000 years.\n\nThe Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) is the most recent common ancestor of all current life on Earth, estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago (in the Paleoarchean).\n\nThe project of a complete description of the phylogeny of biological species is dubbed the \"Tree of Life\". This involves time estimates of all known speciation events; for example, the MRCA of all Carnivora (i.e. the MRCA of \"cats and dogs\") is estimated to have lived of the order of 42 million years ago (Miacidae). \n\nThe concept of the last common ancestor from the perspective of human evolution is described for a popular audience in \"The Ancestor's Tale\" by Richard Dawkins (2004). Dawkins lists \"concestors\" of the human lineage in order of increasing age, including hominin (human-chimpanzee), hominine (human-gorilla), hominid (human-orangutan), hominoid (human-gibbon), and so on in 40 stages in total, down to the last universal ancestor (human-bacteria).\n\nIt is also possible to consider the ancestry of individual genes (or groups of genes, haplotypes) instead of an organism as a whole. \nCoalescent theory describes a stochastic model of how the ancestry of such genetic markers maps to the history of a population.\n\nUnlike organisms, a gene is passed down from a generation of organisms to the next generation either as perfect replicas of itself or as slightly mutated \"descendant genes\". While organisms have ancestry graphs and progeny graphs via sexual reproduction, a gene has a single chain of ancestors and a tree of descendants. An organism produced by sexual cross-fertilization (allogamy) has at least two ancestors (its immediate parents), but a gene always has one ancestor per generation.\n\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is nearly immune to sexual mixing, unlike the nuclear DNA whose chromosomes are shuffled and recombined in Mendelian inheritance. Mitochondrial DNA, therefore, can be used to trace matrilineal inheritance and to find the Mitochondrial Eve (also known as the \"African Eve\"), the most recent common ancestor of all humans via the mitochondrial DNA pathway.\n\nLikewise, Y chromosome is present as a single sex chromosome in the male individual and is passed on to male descendants without recombination. It can be used to trace patrilineal inheritance and to find the Y-chromosomal Adam, the most recent common ancestor of all humans via the Y-DNA pathway.\n\nMitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam have been established by researchers using genealogical DNA tests. Mitochondrial Eve is estimated to have lived about 200,000 years ago. A paper published in March 2013 determined that, with 95% confidence and that provided there are no systematic errors in the study's data, Y-chromosomal Adam lived between 237,000 and 581,000 years ago.\n\nThe MRCA of humans alive today would, therefore, need to have lived more recently than either.\n\nIt is more complicated to infer human ancestry via autosomal chromosomes. Although an autosomal chromosome contains genes that are passed down from parents to children via independent assortment from only one of the two parents, genetic recombination (chromosomal crossover) mixes genes from non-sister chromatids from both parents during meiosis, thus changing the genetic composition of the chromosome.\n\nDifferent types of MRCAs are estimated to have lived at different times in the past. These \"time to MRCA\" (\"TMRCA\") estimates are also computed differently depending on the type of MRCA being considered. Patrilineal and matrilineal MRCAs (Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam) are traced by single gene markers, thus their TMRCA are computed based on DNA test results and established mutation rates as practiced in genetic genealogy. Time to genealogical MRCA of all living humans is computed based on non-genetic, mathematical models and computer simulations.\n\nSince Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam are traced by single genes via a single ancestral parent line, the time to these genetic MRCAs will necessarily be greater than that for the genealogical MRCA. This is because single genes will coalesce more slowly than tracing of conventional human genealogy via both parents. The latter considers only individual humans, without taking into account whether any gene from the computed MRCA actually survives in every single person in the current population.\n\nMitochondrial DNA can be used to trace the ancestry of a set of populations. In this case, populations are defined by the accumulation of mutations on the mtDNA, and special trees are created for the mutations and the order in which they occurred in each population. The tree is formed through the testing of a large number of individuals all over the world for the presence or lack of a certain set of mutations. Once this is done it is possible to determine how many mutations separate one population from another. The number of mutations, together with estimated mutation rate of the mtDNA in the regions tested, allows scientists to determine the approximate time to MRCA (\"TMRCA\") which indicates time passed since the populations last shared the same set of mutations or belonged to the same haplogroup.\n\nIn the case of Y-Chromosomal DNA, TMRCA is arrived at in a different way. Y-DNA haplogroups are defined by single-nucleotide polymorphism in various regions of the Y-DNA. The time to MRCA within a haplogroup is defined by the accumulation of mutations in STR sequences of the Y-Chromosome of that haplogroup only. Y-DNA network analysis of Y-STR haplotypes showing a non-star cluster indicates Y-STR variability due to multiple founding individuals. Analysis yielding a star cluster can be regarded as representing a population descended from a single ancestor. In this case the variability of the Y-STR sequence, also called the microsatellite variation, can be regarded as a measure of the time passed since the ancestor founded this particular population. The descendants of Genghis Khan or one of his ancestors represents a famous star cluster that can be dated back to the time of Genghis Khan.\n\nTMRCA calculations are considered critical evidence when attempting to determine migration dates of various populations as they spread around the world. For example, if a mutation is deemed to have occurred 30,000 years ago, then this mutation should be found amongst all populations that diverged after this date. If archeological evidence indicates cultural spread and formation of regionally isolated populations then this must be reflected in the isolation of subsequent genetic mutations in this region. If genetic divergence and regional divergence coincide it can be concluded that the observed divergence is due to migration as evidenced by the archaeological record. However, if the date of genetic divergence occurs at a different time than the archaeological record, then scientists will have to look at alternate archaeological evidence to explain the genetic divergence. The issue is best illustrated in the debate surrounding the demic diffusion versus cultural diffusion during the European Neolithic.\n\nThe age of the MRCA of all living humans is unknown. It is necessarily younger than the age of either the matrilinear or the patrilinear MRCA, both of which have an estimated age of between roughly 100,000 and 200,000 years ago.\n\nA mathematical, but non-genealogical study by mathematicians Joseph T. Chang, Douglas Rhode and Steve Olson calculated that the MRCA lived remarkably recently, possibly as recently as 300 BCE. This model took into account that people do not truly mate randomly, but that, particularly in the past, people almost always mated with people who lived nearby, and usually with people who lived in their own town or village. It would have been especially rare to mate with somebody who lived in another country. However, Chang et al found that a rare person who mates with a person far away will in time connect the worldwide family tree, and that no population is truly completely isolated. \n\nThe MRCA of all humans almost certainly lived in East Asia, which would have given them key access to extremely isolated populations in Australia and the Americas. Possible locations for the MRCA include places such as the Chuckchi and Kamchatka Peninsulas that are close to Alaska, places such as Indonesia and Malaysia that are close to Australia or a place such as Taiwan or Japan that is more intermediate to Australia and the Americas. European colonization of the Americas and Australia was found by Chang to be too recent to have had a substantial impact on the age of the MRCA. In fact, if the Americas and Australia had never been discovered, the MRCA would only be about 2.3% further back in the past than it is. \n\nNote that the age of the MRCA of a population does not correspond to a population bottleneck, let alone a \"first couple\". It rather reflects the presence of a single individual with high reproductive success in the past, whose genetic contribution has become pervasive throughout the population over time. \nIt is also incorrect to assume that the MRCA passed all, or indeed any, genetic information to every living person. Through sexual reproduction, an ancestor passes half of his or her genes to each descendant in the next generation; after more than 32 generations the contribution of a single ancestor would be on the order of 2, a number proportional to less than a single basepair within the human genome.\n\nThe MRCA is the most recent \"common\" ancestor shared by all individuals in the population under consideration. This MRCA may well have contemporaries who are also ancestral to some but not all of the extant population. The \"identical ancestors point\" is a point in the past more remote than the MRCA at which time there are no longer organisms which are ancestral to some but not all of the modern population. \nDue to pedigree collapse, modern individuals may still exhibit clustering, due to vastly different contributions from each of ancestral population .\n\n"}
{"id": "343261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343261", "title": "Mug shot", "text": "Mug shot\n\nA mug shot or mugshot (an informal term for police photograph or booking photograph) is a photographic portrait of a person from the waist up, typically taken after a person is arrested. The original purpose of the mug shot was to allow law enforcement to have a photographic record of an arrested individual to allow for identification purposes by victims, the public and investigators. However, in the United States, entrepreneurs have recently begun to exploit the mug shot for commercial gains via the mug shot publishing industry.\n\nPhotographing of criminals began in the 1840s only a few years after the invention of photography, but it was not until 1888 that French police officer Alphonse Bertillon standardized the process.\n\n\"Mug\" is an English slang term for \"face\", dating from the 18th century. Mug shot can more loosely mean any small picture of a face used for any reason.\n\nA typical mug shot is two-part, with one side-view photo, and one front-view. The background is usually stark and simple, to avoid distraction from the facial image (as distinguished from a casual snapshot in a more naturalistic setting). Mug shots may be compiled into a mug book in order to determine the identity of a criminal. In high-profile cases, mug shots may also be published in the mass media.\n\nThe earliest photos of prisoners taken for use by law enforcement may have been taken in Belgium in 1843 and 1844. In the United Kingdom, police in Liverpool and Birmingham were photographing criminals by 1848. By 1857, the New York City Police Department had a gallery where daguerreotypes of criminals were displayed.\n\nThe Pinkerton National Detective Agency began using these on wanted posters in the United States. By the 1870s the agency had amassed the largest collection of mug shots in the US.\n\nThe paired arrangement may have been inspired by the 1865 prison portraits taken by Alexander Gardner of accused conspirators in the Lincoln assassination trial, though Gardner's photographs were full-body portraits with only the heads turned for the profile shots.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Paris Commune in 1871, the Prefecture of Police of Paris hired a photographer, Eugène Appert, to take portraits of convicted prisoners. In 1888, Alphonse Bertillon invented the modern mug shot featuring full face and profile views, standardizing the lighting and angles. This system was soon adopted throughout Europe, and in the United States and Russia.\n\nThe arrested person is sometimes required to hold a placard with name, date of birth, booking ID, weight, and other relevant information on it. With digital photography, the digital photograph is linked to a database record concerning the arrest.\n\nMug shots have often been incorporated into wanted posters, including those for the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.\n\nIn the US in the early 21st century an online industry developed around the publication and removal of mug shots from internet websites.\n\nThe US legal system has long held that mug shots can have a negative effect on juries. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held \"The double-shot picture, with front and profile shots alongside each other, is so familiar, from 'wanted' posters in the post office, motion pictures and television, that the inference that the person involved has a criminal record, or has at least been in trouble with the police, is natural, perhaps automatic.\"\n\nThe Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence says \"Because of the risk of prejudice to the defendant inherent in the admission of photographs of the 'mug shot' variety, judges and prosecutors are required to 'use reasonable means to avoid calling the jury's attention to the source of such photographs used to identify the defendant.' \" (p. 617) Elsewhere it cites a ruling in \"Commonwealth v. Martin\" that \"admission of a defendant's mug shot is 'laden for characterizing the defendant as a careerist in crime.\n\nOther states have similar rules.\n\nA mug book is a collection of photographs of criminals, typically in mug shots taken at the time of an arrest. A mug book is used by an eyewitness to a crime, with the assistance of law enforcement, in an effort to identify the perpetrator. Research has shown that grouped photos result in less false-positives than individually displaying each photo.\n\nMug book also has a meaning in genealogy and history, referring to local biographical histories published in the US in the late 19th century.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22079251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22079251", "title": "Nanjing Massacre denial", "text": "Nanjing Massacre denial\n\nNanking Massacre denial is the denial that Imperial Japanese forces murdered hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians during the Second Sino-Japanese War, a highly controversial episode in Sino-Japanese relations. Some historians accept the findings of the Tokyo tribunal with respect to the scope and nature of the atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army after the Battle of Nanking, others do not accept. In Japan, however, there has been a debate over the extent and nature of the massacre. Relations between Japan and China have been complicated as a result, as denial of the massacre is seen in China as part of an overall unwillingness on Japan's part to admit and apologize for its aggression, or a perceived insensitivity regarding the killings. Estimates of the death toll vary widely, ranging from 40,000 to 200,000. Some scholars, notably the revisionists in Japan, have contended that the actual death toll is far lower, or even that the event was entirely fabricated and never occurred at all. These revisionist accounts of the killings have become a staple of Japanese nationalist discourse.\n\nSome Japanese journalists and social scientists, such as Tomio Hora and Katsuichi Honda, have played prominent roles in countering such historiography, in the decades since the killings. Nonetheless, denialist accounts, such as those of Shūdō Higashinakano, have often created controversy in the global media, particularly in China and other East Asian nations. Coverage of the massacre in Japanese school textbooks also troubles Sino-Japanese relations, as in some textbooks, the massacre is only briefly mentioned.\n\nTakashi Yoshida asserts that, \"Nanjing has figured in the attempts of all three nations [China, Japan and the United States] to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies.\"\n\nIn Japan, interpretation of the Nanking Massacre is a reflection upon the Japanese national identity and notions of \"pride, honor and shame.\" Takashi Yoshida describes the Japanese debate over the Nanjing Incident as \"crystalliz[ing] a much larger conflict over what should constitute the ideal perception of the nation: Japan, as a nation, acknowledges its past and apologizes for its wartime wrongdoings; or... stands firm against foreign pressures and teaches Japanese youth about the benevolent and courageous martyrs who fought a just war to save Asia from Western aggression.\" In some nationalist circles in Japan, speaking of a large-scale massacre at Nanjing is regarded as Japan bashing' (in the case of foreigners) or 'self-flagellation' (in the case of Japanese).\"\n\nDavid Askew characterizes the Nanjing Incident as having \"emerged as a fundamental keystone in the construction of the modern Chinese national identity.\" According to Askew, \"a refusal to accept the \"orthodox\" position on Nanjing can be construed as an attempt to deny the Chinese nation a legitimate voice in international society\".\n\nThe precise definition of the geographical area, duration of the massacre, as well as the definition of who was a victim to be considered for counting deaths in the massacre forms a major part of both the definition of the massacre and in the arguments of denialists. Among the most extreme denialists, such as Tanaka Masaaki, revisionist claims of several dozen or several hundred are claimed, while figures within the range of 50,000-300,000 is typically articulated among mainstream historians.\n\nThe common revisionist viewpoint, made by denialists such as Higashinakano Shudo is that the geographical area of the incident should be limited to the few square kilometers of the city, and they typically estimate the population to be about 200,000-250,000. However, this geographic definition is almost universally unheard of outside of revisionist circles. Their use of 200,000-250,000 civilians is also only includes those in the Nanking safety zone, which does not include everyone inside of the city.\n\nMost historians include a much larger area around the city, including the Xiaguan district (the suburbs north of Nanjing city, about 31 km in size) and other areas on the outskirts of the city. Zhang Lianhong estimated the population of greater Nanjing was between 535,000 and 635,000 civilians and soldiers just prior to the Japanese occupation back in 2003. In 2008 he revised his estimate to 468,000-568,000. Some historians also include six counties around Nanjing, known as the Nanjing Special Municipality. With the six surrounding counties included, the population of Nanjing is estimated to be more than 1 million.\n\nThe duration of the incident is naturally defined by its geography: the earlier the Japanese entered the area, the longer the duration. The Battle of Nanking ended on December 13, when the divisions of the Japanese Army entered the walled city of Nanking. The Tokyo War Crime Tribunal defined the period of the massacre to the ensuing six weeks. More conservative estimates say the massacre started on December 14, when the troops entered the Safety Zone, and that it lasted for six weeks.\n\nMost scholars have accepted figures between 50,000-300,000 dead as an approximate total. Revisionists in Japan, however have contended at times that the actual death toll is far lower, or even that the event was entirely fabricated and never occurred at all.\n\nDuring the war, Japanese media and newspapers typically portrayed a positive view of the war in China. Reports on the massacre were generally muted, and newspaper reports and photos typically emphasized cooperation between Chinese civilians and Japanese soldiers. Massacre denialists claim that the news published in the Japanese media and newspapers were \"true\" and \"reliable\" stories. However, most mainstream historians counter that it is well known that the \" Naikaku Jōhōkyoku\" (\"Cabinet Information Bureau\"), a consortium of military, politicians and professionals created in 1936 as a \"committee\" and upgraded to a \"division\" in 1937, applied censorship of all the media of the Shōwa regime and that this office held a policing authoring over the realm of publishing. Therefore, the \" Naikaku Jōhōkyoku\"'s activities were proscriptive as well as prescriptive. Besides issuing detailed guidelines to publishers, it made suggestions that were all but commands. From 1938, printed medias \"would come to realize that their survival depended upon taking cues from the Cabinet Information Bureau and its flagship publication, \"Shashin shūhō\", designers of the \"look\" of the soldier, and the \"look\" of the war.\"\n\nArticle 12 of the censorship guideline for newspapers issued on September 1937 stated that any news article or photograph \"unfavorable\" to the Imperial Army was subject to a gag. Article 14 prohibited any \"photographs of atrocities\" but endorsed reports about the \"cruelty of the Chinese\" soldiers and civilians.\n\nOwing to the censorship, none of the hundred Japanese reporters in Nanking when the city was captured wrote anything unfavorable to their countrymen. In 1956, however, Masatake Imai, correspondent for the \"Tokyo Asahi\" who reported only about the \"majestic and soul-stirring ceremony\" of the triumphal entry of the Imperial Army, revealed he witnessed a mass execution of 400 to 500 Chinese men near \"Tokyo Asahi\"s office. \"I wish I could write about it\", he told his colleague Nakamura. \"Someday, we will, but not for the time being. But we sure saw it\", Nakamure answered.\nShigeharu Matsumoto, the Shanghai bureau Chief of \"Domei\" News Agency, wrote that the Japanese reporters he interviewed all told him they saw between 2,000 and 3,000 corpses around the Xiaguan area and a reporter, Yuji Maeda, saw recruits executing Chinese prisoners-of-war with bayonets.\nJiro Suzuki, a correspondent for the \"Tokyo Nichi Nichi\", wrote, \"When I went back to the Zhongshan Gate, I saw for the first time an unearthly, brutal massacre. On the top of the wall, about 25 meters high, the prisoners of war were rounded up in a line. They were being stabbed by bayonets and shoved away off the wall. A number of Japanese soldiers polished their bayonets, shouted to themselves once and thrust their bayonets in the chest or back of POWs.\"\n\nHistorian Tokushi Kasahara notes, \"Some deniers argue that Nanjing was much more peaceful than we generally think. They always show some photographs with Nanjing refugees selling some food in the streets or Chinese people smiling in the camps. They are forgetting about Japanese propaganda. The Imperial Army imposed strict censorship. Any photographs with dead bodies couldn't get through. So photographers had to remove all the bodies before taking pictures of streets and buildings in the city (...) Even if the photos were not staged, the refugees had no choice but to fawn on the Japanese soldiers. Acting otherwise meant their deaths...\"\n\nIris Chang's 1997 book, \"The Rape of Nanking\", renewed global interest in the Nanking Massacre. The book sold more than half a million copies when it was first published in the US, and according to \"The New York Times\", received general critical acclaim. \"The Wall Street Journal\" wrote that it was the \"first comprehensive examination of the destruction of this Chinese imperial city\", and that Chang \"skillfully excavated from oblivion the terrible events that took place\". \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" wrote that it was a \"compelling account of a horrendous episode that, until recently, has been largely forgotten.\" The text, however, was not without controversy. Chang's account drew on new sources to break new ground in the study of the period. Japanese ultra-nationalists maintained that the Nanking Massacre was a fabrication which sought \"to demonize the Japanese race, culture, history, and nation.\"\n\nTakashi Hoshiyama characterizes opinion in Japan about the Nanking Massacre as \"broadly divided into two schools of thought: the massacre affirmation school, which asserts that a large-scale massacre took place, and the massacre denial school, which asserts that, a certain number of isolated aberrations aside, no massacre took place.\"\n\nDavid Askew asserts that the debate over the Nanking Massacre has been hijacked by \"two large groups of layperson activists\".\n\"Chinese\" are turned into a single, homogenised voice and portrayed as sinister and manipulative twisters of the truth, while the similarly homogenized \"Japanese\" are portrayed as uniquely evil, as cruel and blood-thirsty beyond redemption, and as deniers of widely accepted historical truths.\n\nBoth positions are victimisation narratives. One depicts the Chinese as helpless victims of brutal Japanese imperialism in the winter of 1937–38, while the other depicts the gullible Japanese, innocent in the ways of the world, as victims of Chinese machinations and propaganda in the post-war era.\n\nJapanese affirmationists not only accept the validity of these tribunals and their findings, but also assert that Japan must stop denying the past and come to terms with Japan's responsibility for the war of aggression against its Asian neighbors. Affirmationists have drawn the attention of the Japanese public to atrocities committed by the Japanese Army during World War II in general and the Nanking Massacre in particular in support of an anti-war agenda.\n\nThe most extreme denialists, by and large, reject the findings of the tribunals as a kind of \"victor's justice\" in which only the winning side's version of events are accepted. Described within Japan as the Illusion School (\"maboroshi-ha\"), they deny the massacre and argue that only a few POWs and civilians were killed by the Japanese military in Nanjing. More moderate denialists argue that between several thousand and 38,000–42,000 were massacred.\n\nMassacre denialists such as Higashinakano argue that the \"Nanking Massacre\" was a fabrication and war-time propaganda spread by the Chinese Nationalists and Communists. He argues that the activities of the Japanese military in Nanking were in accordance with international law and were humane. Among other claims, he has denied that there was execution of POWs in uniform, and cited anecdotes claiming that Chinese POWs were treated humanely by Japanese soldiers. However, Higashinakano has also claimed at times that the executed POWs were illegitimate combatants, and so their execution was legitimate under international law. Higashinakano believes some several thousand 'illegitimate combatants' may have been executed in such a fashion.\n\nWhat Higashinakano believed is against the articles of Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which was ratified by Japan and China. Japan violated the spirits and the statements of laws of war.\nFor examples, according to historian Akira Fujiwara, on August 6, 1937, deputy minister of Military of Japan notified of Japanese Troops in Shanghai that the army's proposition to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners. This directive also advised staff officers to stop using the term \"prisoner of war\". During the massacre, Japanese troops in fact embarked on a determined search for former soldiers, in which thousands of young men were captured, most of whom were killed. In another case, Japanese troops gathered 1,300 Chinese soldiers and civilians at the Taiping Gate and killed them. The victims were blown up with landmines, then doused with petrol before being set on fire. Those that were left alive afterward were killed with bayonets. F. Tillman Durdin and Archibald Steele, American news correspondents, reported that they had seen bodies of killed Chinese soldiers forming mounds six feet high at the Nanking Yijiang gate in the north. Durdin, who was working for the New York Times, made a tour of Nanking before his departure from the city. He heard waves of machine-gun fire and witnessed the Japanese soldiers gun down some two hundred Chinese within ten minutes. Two days later, in his report to the \"New York Times\", he stated that the alleys and street were filled with civilian bodies, including women and children.\n\nA claim that Harold Timperley, whose report formed the basis of the Tribunal's findings, was reporting only hearsay, and that thus, the figure of 300,000 dead was \"unreal\" drew a response from Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, who suggested that Higashinakano's assertions and conclusion were not \"sensible\":\n\nHigashinakano jumps to this conclusion in all earnestness because he clings to a hypothetical fixation that the Atrocity never happened. This forces him to seize any shred of evidence, whether sound or not, to sustain and systematize that delusion.\n\nHigashinakano has also at times denied the occurrence of mass rape on the part of Japanese troops, at times ascribing it to Chinese soldiers, and at other times simply denying its occurrence. The occurrence of rape during the massacre is testified to by John Rabe, elected leader of the Nanjing Safety Zone, who writes:\n\"Two Japanese soldiers have climbed over the garden wall and are about to break into our house. When I appear they give the excuse that they saw two Chinese soldiers climb over the wall. When I show them my party badge, they return the same way. In one of the houses in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital. (...) Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College Girls alone. You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers.\"\n\nMinnie Vautrin, a professor at Ginling College, wrote in her diary on that day, \"Oh God, control the cruel beastliness of the Japanese soldiers in Nanking tonight..,\" and on the 19th, \"In my wrath, I wished I had the power to smite them for their dastardly work. How ashamed women of Japan would be if they knew these tales of horror.\"\n\nVautrin also wrote in her diary that she had to go to the Japanese embassy repeatedly from December 18 to January 13 to get proclamations to prohibit Japanese soldiers from committing crimes at Ginling because the soldiers tore the documents up before taking women away.\n\nXia Shuqin, a woman testifying that she had been a massacre victim sued Higashinakano for defamation, for a claim made in a book written in 1998 that the murder of her family had been performed by Chinese, rather than Japanese soldiers. On 5 February 2009, the Japanese Supreme Court ordered Higashinakano and the publisher, \"Tendensha\", to pay 4 million yen in damages to Mrs. Xia. According to the court, Higashinakano failed to prove that she and the girl were different persons, and that she was not a witness of the Nanking massacre, as Higashinakano had claimed in his book.\n\nIn his book \"The Fabrication of the 'Nanjing Massacre', Masaaki Tanaka argues that there was no indiscriminate killing at all in Nanjing and that the massacre was a fabrication manufactured by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) and the Chinese government for the purpose of propaganda. He has in addition argued that the Tokyo Tribunal was 'victor's justice' and not a fair trial. He provides a figure of roughly 2000 deaths for the entirety of the massacre. Tanaka has also argued the claim that many civilians were killed by the Chinese military. These claims have come under heavy fire both within and outside Japan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7999544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7999544", "title": "Nordic Classicism", "text": "Nordic Classicism\n\nNordic Classicism was a style of architecture that briefly blossomed in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland) between 1910 and 1930.\n\nUntil a resurgence of interest for the period during the 1980s (marked by several scholarly studies and public exhibitions), Nordic Classicism was regarded as a mere interlude between two far more well-known architectural movements, National Romanticism, or \"Jugendstil\" (often seen as equivalent or parallel to Art Nouveau), and Functionalism (aka Modernism).\n\nThe development of Nordic Classicism was no isolated phenomenon, but took off from classical traditions already existing in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. Nordic Classicism can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from vernacular architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and Neoclassicism, but also the early stirrings of Modernism from the Deutscher Werkbund – especially their exhibition of 1914 - and by the mid-1920s the \"Esprit Nouveau\" emerging from the theories of Le Corbusier.\n\nThe modernist influence went beyond mere aesthetics: urbanisation tied to modern building techniques and the introduction of regulations both in building and town planning, and moreover, to the rise of social forces that resulted in a change in political ideology toward the Left, resulting in the Nordic welfare state, and new programmes for public buildings such as hospitals (e.g. the Beckomberga Hospital in western Stockholm (1927-1935) by Carl Westman) and schools (e.g. the Fridhemsplan school, Stockholm, (1925–27) by Georg A. Nilsson). But while Nordic classicism was employed for a number of important public buildings, it was also applied as a model for low-cost housing (e.g. the Puu-Käpylä Garden Town, Helsinki (1920–25) by Martti Välikangas) and domestic architecture in general (e.g. an affordable sense of style for the nouveau-riche).\n\n1930 is usually considered the end point of Nordic Classicism because that was the year of the Stockholm Exhibition, designed mostly by Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz, when a more purist Modernism was unveiled as a model for a modern society. However, key buildings continued to be built in the classical style after that, notably Östberg's Maritime Museum in Stockholm (1931–34).\n\nCertain architects had reached the culmination of their careers already when the National Romantic style came, but their latter works were in the Nordic Classicism style (e.g. Carl Westman), the career of others culminated with Nordic Classicism (e.g. Ivar Tengbom and Ragnar Östberg), while others later went on to achieve far greater significance as Modernist architects (e.g. Arne Jacobsen, Alvar Aalto, and Sven Markelius). The two figures who achieved greatest significance in both periods, however, were Swedish architects Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz.\n\nDenmark: Kay Fisker, Hack Kampmann, Kaj Gottlob, Ivar Bentsen, Povl Baumann, Poul Holsøe, Edvard Thomsen, Thomas Havning, Holger Jacobsen, Kaare Klint, Arne Jacobsen, Carl Petersen, Aage Rafn, Steen Eiler Rasmussen, Sven Risom, and Frits Schlegel.\n\nFinland: Gunnar Taucher, Uno Ullberg, Martti Välikangas, J.S. Sirén, Alvar Aalto, Pauli E. Blomstedt, Elsi Borg, Erik Bryggman, Hilding Ekelund, Heikki Siikonen, and Oiva Kallio.\n\nNorway: Lars Backer, Lorentz Ree, Sverre Pedersen, Nicolai Beer, Finn Berner, Harald Hals, Herman Munthe-Kaas, Gudolf Blakstad, Finn Bryn, Jens Dunker and Johan Ellefsen.\n\nSweden: Ragnar Östberg, Gunnar Asplund, Carl Westman, Sigurd Lewerentz, Carl Bergsten, Sigfrid Ericson, Torben Grut, Ragnar Hjorth, Cyrillus Johansson, Erik Lallerstedt, Gunnar Leche, Sven Markelius, Gunnar Morssing, George Nilsson, Ture Ryberg, Albin Stark, Eskil Sundahl, Lars Israel Wahlman, Sven Wallander, Hakon Ahlberg and Ivar Tengbom.\n\nThough these architects are listed by country, during this period there was an intense cultural exchange among the Nordic countries (many architects worked in more than one), but also considerable development in the architect's sphere of activity, from consultant to the bourgeoisie to town planner concerned with infrastructure, dwelling and public services. As Swedish historian Henrik O. Anderson (1982: 23), has put it, this was an architecture of democracy, not radical avant-gardism. Furthermore, with the exception of Finland, the other Nordic countries had avoided getting involved in the First World War, allowing for continued cultural development.\n\nInterest in Nordic Classicism, especially in its most classical form, arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the height of postmodernism when critics, historians and architecture teachers were looking for historical precedents for the architecture of such architects as Michael Graves, Leon Krier and Robert Stern. Nordic classicism provided that precedent, especially with such seminal buildings as Gunnar Asplund's Scandia Cinema in Stockholm (1924), Listers District Courthouse (1917–21), Villa Snellman in Djursholm (1917–18) and Stockholm Public Library (1920-28), as well as the landscape and buildings of the Skogskyrkogården Cemetery, Stockholm (1917-1940) by both Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz.\n\nIn regards to architectural style, there were several precedents or reasons which account for the rise of Nordic Classicism. First was the existing classical tradition, borne from the architecture of Absolutism – that is, the classical architectural symbols of power of the Swedish and Danish monarchies – down to the vernacular, for instance in terms of considerations for symmetry, detailing and proportion.\n\nThroughout the 19th century there were a number of factors contributing to a more simplified classicism. The teachings of J.N.L. Durand at the École Polytechnique of Paris at the beginning of the 19th century had attempted to rationalise the language and building techniques of classicism, while allowing for simple additive compositions. Durand's teachings spread, entering German culture in the form of Romantic Classicism with the work of Friedrich Gilly and Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Scholars were at the time uncovering the remnants of Pompeii, and discovering the use of bright colour in Roman architecture – an aspect that had more or less been forgotten in the Renaissance, but also rediscovering Greece and Egypt. These aspects were incorporated into Neoclassicism and continued into Nordic Classicism (e.g. The Thorvaldsen Museum, Copenhagen, 1839–48, by M.G. Bindesbøll, incorporates Egyptian motifs as does Asplund's Stockholm Public Library).\n\nThere are also 'circles of reaction' to consider. Art Nouveau and National Romanticism had little impact in Denmark, while in Sweden, Norway and Finland there were also strong National Romantic reactions. Neoclassicism had arrived in Finland via Saint Petersburg as a universal language but by the end of the 19th century came to represent an alien presence – that of Russia. Thus when stirrings of political independence appeared in Finland and Norway, a rugged, national romantic architecture – a local variation of Art Nouveau – playing on the nationalistic myths, took hold. Nordic classicism was thus a counter-reaction to that style and eclecticism in general; a movement toward universalism, internationalism and simplification.\n\nMany of the architects who practiced in the Nordic Classical style made pilgrimages to northern Italy to study Italian vernacular architecture. With close cultural links at that time between the Nordic countries and Germany, another important source came from German critics of Art Nouveau, in particular Hermann Muthesius – who had been a promoter of the English Arts and Crafts movement and founded the Deutscher Werkbund in 1907 - and Paul Schultze-Naumburg, as well as the latter’s student Heinrich Tessenow, and Peter Behrens.\n\nIn turn, the thinking in Nordic Classicism became one of the basis for the development of Modernism in the Nordic Countries. The idea that there would have been a continuity between vernacular and modernism has been seen as counter to received historical opinion about the rise of Modernism, beginning with Le Corbusier and his 5 Points for Architecture, which are seen as overturning 5 basic principles of Classicism. A demonstration in real time of the move from Nordic Classicism to a pure Functionalism is offered by Alvar Aalto's design for the Viipuri Library (1927–35), which went through a profound transformation from the original architectural competition proposal in 1927 (owing much to Gunnar Asplund) to the severely functionalist building, completed eight years later in a purist modernist style, influenced by Le Corbusier.\n\n"}
{"id": "315938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315938", "title": "Numerus clausus", "text": "Numerus clausus\n\nNumerus clausus (\"closed number\" in Latin) is one of many methods used to limit the number of students who may study at a university. In many cases, the goal of the \"numerus clausus\" is simply to limit the number of students to the maximum feasible in some particularly sought-after areas of studies. In historical terms however, in some countries, \"numerus clausus\" policies were religious or racial quotas, both in intent and function.\nThe \"numerus clausus\" is used in countries and universities where the number of applicants greatly exceeds the number of available places for students. This is the case in many countries of continental Europe. Students in much of Europe choose their field of specialization when they begin university study, unlike students in North America, who specialize later. Fields such as medicine, law, biology, dentistry, pharmacology, psychology and business administration are particularly popular and therefore harder to gain admittance to study.\n\nIn November 2002 the Brazilian government passed Federal Law 10.558/2002, known as the \"Quota Law\". The law allowed for the establishment of racial quotas at public universities. In 2012 the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil unanimously upheld the law.\n\nThe \"numerus clausus\" is used in Germany to address overcrowding at universities. There are local admission restrictions, which are set up for a particular degree program (\"\") at the university's discretion, and nationwide admission restrictions in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and pharmacy. Not all degree programs restrict admissions. The most common admission criterion is the final grade of the university entrance qualification, that is the high school completion certificate formally allowing the applicant to study at a German university. Typically, this is the \"Abitur\". The final grade takes into account the grades of the final exams as well as the course grades. In colloquial usage, \"numerus clausus\" may also refer to the lowest admitted grade in this process. Other criteria, e.g. interviews, are increasingly common as well.\n\nThe Finnish system of implementing the \"numerus clausus\" provides a comparison to the German model. In Germany, the main weight of the student selection lies on the \"Abitur\" grades (i.e. high school diploma). In Finland, which has a similar nationwide final exam, the matriculation examination (Finnish \"ylioppilastutkinto\"), the majority of student selections are based on entrance exams. Most degree programs consist of a single major subject and have their own entrance procedures. Nearly all programs have a quota in which the score is calculated solely on the basis of the entrance exam. The written exams usually consist of open-ended questions requiring the applicant to write an essay or solve problems. Multiple choice tests are uncommon.\n\nIn fields where the competition for study places is less fierce. This is especially the case with the engineering and natural science programs. It is relatively easy to be accepted in these fields—about one-third of the study places in technology are awarded on the basis of the matriculation exam. The rest of the students are admitted on the basis of an entrance exam. After receiving a study place, the student must accept it in writing on the pain of forfeiting the place. In case the students receive more than one study place, they must select one. During the year, one person may accept only a single study place in an institution of higher education. The system is enforced through a national database on student admissions.\n\nIn the Finnish system, the \"numerus clausus\" is the most important factor limiting student numbers. After gaining entrance, traditionally a student cannot be expelled, pays no tuition, and enjoys a state student benefit. The new legislation, introduced in the summer of 2005, limits the study period to seven years, but it is anticipated that it will be relatively easy to receive a permission for a longer study time. No changes to the financial position of the student are currently being considered (as of the summer of 2005).\n\nIn France, admission to the \"grandes écoles\" is obtained by competitive exams with a fixed, limited number of positions each year. Also, at the end of the first year of medical studies in universities, there is a competitive exam with a \"numerus clausus\" for determining which students are allowed to proceed to the second year; in later years of medical studies there is a competitive exam (\"concours de l'internat\") for choosing medical specialties.\n\n\"Numerus clausus\" is also used in Ireland. University College Dublin uses the system in its admission for Medicine and Veterinary Medicine.\n\nThe introduction of the \"numerus clausus\" in Switzerland has limited the access to the medical studies at the universities. At all universities of the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the students need to have a high score on an aptitude test that comprises logical and spatial thinking and text understanding skills.\n\nThe universities in the western, French-speaking part of Switzerland did not decide to introduce a \"numerus clausus\". Instead, these universities provide unrestricted access to the first-year curriculum in medicine; and the best first-year students are allowed to further their medical studies at the same or at another university. In other popular faculties like psychology or journalism, there are also aptitude tests—but they concern only a single university.\n\nStarting in the 1980s, and ongoing , there have been allegations of an Asian quota in college admissions, analogous to the earlier Jewish quota.\n\nBefore World War II, the limitations in the number of students of Jewish origin in many countries were usually resulting from their disproportionate numbers in the national universities. This limitation took the form of quotas restricting the number of Jewish students so that their share in the student population would correspond with their share in the general population. The limitations in enrolment were introduced in over a dozen countries, allowing access to higher education to a greater proportion of non-Jewish students.\n\nCountries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students, at various times, have included: Austria, Canada, Hungary, Imperial Russia, Iraq, Latvia (from 1934 under Kārlis Ulmanis regime), Netherlands, Poland, Romania, United States, Vichy France, and Yugoslavia among others.\n\nCertain Canadian universities had longstanding quotas on the number of Jews admitted to the respective universities. McGill University's strict quota was the longest, being officially adopted in 1920 up until the late 1960s.\n\nA whole series of \"numerus clausus\" resolutions were adopted in 1929 on the grounds of race and place of origin, not religion. On 25 April 1933, the Nazi government introduced a 1.5 percent quota for new admissions of German non-Aryans, essentially of German Jews enrolling to German high-schools and universities.\n\nThe Hungarian \"numerus clausus\" was introduced in 1920. The law formally placed limits on the number of minority students at university, and legalized corporal punishment. Though the text did not use the term \"Jew\", it was nearly the only group overrepresented in higher education. The policy is often seen as the first Anti-Jewish Act of twentieth century Europe.\n\nIts aim was to restrict the number of Jews to 6 percent, which was their proportion in Hungary at that time; the rate of Jewish students was approximately 15% in the 1910s. In 1928 – also because of the pressure of liberal capital and League of Nations – the act was modified and the passage of the ethnicity quota had been eliminated. In the period of 1938–1945 the anti-Jewish acts were revitalised and eventually much worsened, partly due to German Nazi pressure, and in hope of revising the Treaty of Trianon with the help of Germany.\n\n\"Numerus clausus\" in interwar Poland was unofficially introduced in 1937 by some universities. It was a result of highly disproportionate number of Jewish students in key disciplines including 62.9 percent in stomatology, 34 percent in medical sciences, 29.2 percent in philosophy, 24.9 percent in chemistry and 22.1 percent in law (26 percent by 1929). Such numbers were the cause of a backlash at most Polish universities, with notable protest organized by the non-Jewish political parties.\n\nDuring the partitions of Poland by the neighbouring empires, Poles were denied education, and the severely limited number of schools were poorly funded. Following Poland's return to independence, the advocates of the \"numerus clausus\" policy pointed out that the limit would balance the chance to enter university of all nationalities in Poland (Polish, Lithuanian, Belorussian, Ukrainian, German etc.). The other reason given by the supporters of the idea was that it was an attempt to equal the chance of children from countryside families who had very limited access to education to the chance of the children of Jewish families living in the towns and cities. After World War II similar policies were introduced by the pro-Soviet communists, based on preferential treatment of peasant and working-class children. The students from working-class families were intended to form the new socialist intelligentsia.\n\nBetween 1918 and the 1950s a number of private universities and medical schools in the United States introduced \"numerus clausus\" policies limiting admissions of students based on their religion or race to certain percentages within the college population. Many minority groups were negatively impacted by these policies; one of the groups affected was Jewish applicants, whose admission to some New England- and New York City-area liberal arts colleges fell significantly between the late 1910s and the mid-1930s. For instance, the admission to Harvard University during that period fell from 27.6% to 17.1% and in Columbia University from 32.7% to 14.6%. Corresponding quotas were introduced in the medical and dental schools resulting during the 1930s in the decline of Jewish students: e.g. in Cornell University School of Medicine from 40% in 1918–22 to 3.57% in 1940–41, in Boston University Medical School from 48.4% in 1929–30 to 12.5% in 1934–35. At Yale University, Dean Milton Winternitz's instructions to the admissions office regarding ethnic quotas were very specific: \"Never admit more than five Jews, take only two Italian Catholics, and take no blacks at all.\" During this period, a notable exception among U. S. medical schools was the medical school of Middlesex University, which had no quotas and many Jewish faculty members and students; school officials believed that antisemitism played a role in the school's failure to secure AMA accreditation.\n\nThe most common method, employed by 90% of American universities and colleges at the time to identify the \"desirable\" (native-born, white, Protestant) applicants, was the application form questions about their religious preference, race, and nationality. Other more subtle methods included restrictions on scholarships, rejection of transfer students, and preferences for alumni sons and daughters.\n\nLegacy preference for university admissions was devised in 1925 at Yale University, where the proportional number of Jews in the student body was growing at a rate that became alarming to the school's administrators. Prior to that year, Yale had begun to incorporate such amorphous criteria as 'character' and 'solidity', as well as 'physical characteristics', into its admissions process as an excuse for screening out Jewish students; but nothing was as effective as legacy preference, which allowed the admissions board to summarily pass over Jews in favor of 'Yale sons of good character and reasonably good record', as a 1929 memo phrased it. Other schools, including Harvard, soon began to pursue similar policies for similar reasons, and Jewish students in the Ivy League schools were maintained at a steady 10% through the 1950s. Such policies were gradually discarded during the early 1960s, with Yale being one of the last of the major schools to eliminate the last vestige with the class of 1970 (entering in 1966). While legacy admissions as a way of screening out Jewish students may have ceased, the practice of giving preference to legacies has continued to the present day. In the 1998 book \"The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions\", authors William G. Bowen, former Princeton University president, and Derek Bok, former Harvard University president, found \"the overall admission rate for legacies was almost twice that for all other candidates\".\n\nThe religion preference question was eventually dropped from the admission application forms and noticeable evidence of informal \"numerus clausus\" policies in the American private universities and medical schools decreased by the 1950s.\n\n\"Numerus clausus\" is also a rule that regulates the number of practitioners of a public service in many areas. In the U.S., for instance, it can limit the number of liquor stores to be found in a given geographic area.\n\nIn France, it limits the distribution of public notaries geographically and, in effect, limits competition for their services (since their fees are fixed by the state). Notaries handle, for instance, title transactions, which is not allowed to lawyers in France. Similar limitations apply to pharmacists, and to licensed premises for the consumption of strong alcoholic beverages.\n\nIn India the system of caste quotas for job placement is enforced, and vigorously defended by strikes and riots.\n\nOften, the rule is administered by the corporation or professional body to which the public servant must adhere, but it is also employed by state entities that have the responsibility for assuring the uniformity of a public service across a national geography.\n\n\"Numerus clausus\" is also used in law, property law in particular, as the principle that the system of estates allows only a limited number of property rights available in a legal system. The \"numerus clausus\" principle has its roots in Roman law.

{"id": "29914459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29914459", "title": "Oral history in modern Mali", "text": "Oral history in modern Mali\n\nCirca 1230s-1600s, the Mali Empire was created in Western Africa along the Niger River. Often associated with being founded by Sunjata Keita, the history of Mali is extremely based on oral history. The story of the founder of Mali, Sunjata Keita, is largely based on oral history. Oral history may be defined as the preservation and interpretation of historical, cultural or personal experiences by way of a speaker. In Mali, such a speaker can be described as a poet, a storyteller, a praise singer or a musician. A large amount of Mali’s history is transferred via oral historians. Such oral historians in Mali are known as griots, Jalis, and Jelis. The origins of oral history in Mali may be traced back to the story of Sunjata Keita. Modern-day oral history in Mali has transformed from the history based griots to a more contemporary musical and negotiator based griots. The current state of oral history in Mali has travelled to other realms like popular culture and politics.\n\nOne cannot become a Griot; one must be born into a family of griots to hold that position. Sometimes, a key aspect to signify who is a griot can be found in the last name. Jeliyas are similar to griots but are not born into a griot family. Jeliya described as the \"art of the griot\" refers to a type of \"musical and verbal artist\". Jelis have an \"exclusive right to play the kora\". Jelis are similar to griots because they also recount history but the jelis role is to \"Sing and recount Mande social and political life\". In reference to a griot, griots are only supposed to marry other griots. Like jelis, griots in Mali often use instruments and music to recite history which ultimately renders the history a performance and not just a story.\n\nIn the Mali Empire, an evident example of oral history is the Sunjata Keita or Sundiata Keita story. The Sunjata Keita story remains a strong representation of oral history. Because there are a plethora of versions of the Sunjata story, this exemplifies how oral history can change slightly depending on the griot reciting the history. Also, oral history can be traced back to Sunjata because in the story Sunjata’s griots play a major part to his success. Bamba Suso in his version of \"Sunjata\" writes:\n\nSuso’s story of Sunjata shows how griots often remain within the family lineage. When Sunjata’s father died, like other parts of his father’s estate, Sunjata was able to choose griots from his father’s estate as well. The \"Sunjata\" story shows that in the Mali Empire, noble families needed griots in order to spread family history. Sunjata states, “I want no part of it [father’s property] except the griots”. Sunjata’s need for a griot emphasizes how noble families and griots were often seen as undividable. In the Mali Empire, griots were associated with noble families because such families needed oral historians to accompany them in order to tell the history of their life. Emperors and great warriors often had griots and with such griots, oral history in Mali spreads. The oral historians who were “assigned” to or rather “chosen” for a family were set to remain loyal to that family for life. Loyalty was an important quality a griot must have. In Suso’s version of the Sunjata story says: “We [griots] will not abandon him”. In the Mali Empire, the bond between griots and the emperor, warrior-king, or family they served was meant to be a lifelong bond. In \"Sunjata\", Sunjata’s griot, Bala Faaseega Kuyate acted as both the oral historian for Sunjata and his advisor at times. Throughout Suso’s version of \"Sunjata\", Bala Faaseega Kuyate accompanies Sunjata. Suso writes:\nThe relationship between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate describes the relationship between oral historians and emperors or aristocrats in the Mali Empire. Sunjata was very protective of Kuyate, in turn; Kuyate was extremely loyal to Sunjata. It is the job of the griots to be loyal to the family or person they “work” for. Griots did not merely work for the nobility, griots in the Mali Empire also worked for villages. Such griots were used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the village.\n\nNot only were griots used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the villages, but oral historians and griots are also an important cultural facet in Mali in terms of language. Because oral history, is exactly as the name describes, a means of passing history verbally, language is also passed on by oral historians.\n\nIn present-day Mali, oral historians / griots are sometimes seen as “intermediaries” between two parties. Oral historians in modern Mali often act as mediators between those from different political parties. Jan Jansen in \"The Griot’s Craft: An Essay on Oral Tradition and Diplomacy\" discusses the role and skills of oral historians in modern-day Mali:\n\nHe writes about “being sent” as a strategy for modern-day griots. Similarly to griots during the Mali Empire, modern-day griots must also pass messages between different parties. The skill of “being sent” allows for “negotiation” to occur between parties that may not have negotiated without the help of griots. The oral historians understand that their role does not merely rest on capturing and narrating history, but their role goes as far as encompassing negotiator between two different parties with distinct ideals. Oral historians in modern-day Mali provide a source of communication between such parties. Not only do oral historians chronicle history but they also create a means to communicate. Once the “negotiator” / oral historian completes his goal of mediating tensions between the different parties, the parties are able to have a “reconciliation festivity,” the griots position as both a negotiator and historian are exemplified. Throughout Western Africa and Africa as a continent, oral historians act as mediators between conflicting parties. Oral historians are often essential to solve certain problems. Jansen’s work provides a detailed account of other skills that oral historians / griots need in modern-day Mali. Jansen describes a griot’s skills as a means to “master and manipulate the processes of ‘heating’ and ‘cooling down’ social situations”. Some of the skills that Jansen describes are:\n\nBecause oral historians in modern Mali are often used as negotiators, the above stated skills ease the process of solving problems between the different political parties. Oral historians in modern Mali acting as negotiators do not allow the parties to meet until the problem at hand is solved. The reasoning behind not allowing the parties to initially meet acts as a way to ease the anger members of the conflicting parties may feel toward each other. Jansen writes: “[a member of a conflicting party] must never express his opinions to the person he is in conflict with since this person will die of anger”. It is the job of the griot to keep both parties separate to eliminate the chance of this anger occurring. Similarly to the reason why the griot does not allow both parties to meet initially, the griot does not allow both parties to meet as a means to eliminate tensions that can occur if both parties were to meet. The skill of repetitive talking that Jansen lists is used for “serious matters”. Jansen writes:\n\nThe repetitive talking of oral history transforms the message being passed into a “supra-personal phenomenon” and allows the message to “gain a semblance of authority”. Likewise, the repetitive nature of oral history transforms messages and creates similar yet slightly different versions of historical events. Jansen describes “slowing down negotiations” as essential to appease both sides of conflicting parties. Jansen’s presentation of griots in modern Mali as messengers depicts the transformation of oral historians over time. During the Mali Empire, oral historians often were limited to working with a specific family or emperor but in current Mali, oral historians are no longer limited but can act as messengers between various political parties or other groups.\n\nThe relationship between griots and nobles may appear to be a difficult one to understand. As seen through the relationship described between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate, the noble and griot relationship is sometimes represented as a partnership. Dr. Barbara G. Hoffman, an associate professor of Anthropology at Cleveland State University, discusses in her book \"Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande\" the relationship between griots and nobles. She writes that “tension is often expressed through nobles’ criticism of griots’ “empty speech” or griots’ disdain for nobles lack of self-knowledge”. While griots take pride in understanding themselves and life around them, nobles are often more focused on worldly aspects. Despite the relationship that is suggested in \"Sunjata\", the relationship between nobles and griots can be seen as extremely different from that of loyalty and partnership. Hoffman views the relationship between griots and nobles as showing a sharp distinction between castes. Hoffman writes, “This [the caste system] was a central issue for the griots and nobles present at this Kita celebration. They generated social difference and the reinforcement of social boundaries through a repertoire of strategies for recreating old social structures as well as for creating new ones”. In modern Mali, griots are often seen as being a part of a lower caste then nobles despite the help and history they provide to nobles and society. In Hoffman's work addresses the position of oral historians in castes \"Mande-style\". Hoffman writes, \"Living up to one's caste ideals is a source of pride in Mande; violating them a cause for disgrace.\" The position of griots in the Mande caste system was that of extremely lower stature then the nobles griots and oral historians have a tendency to work for. Oral historians molded their way into the caste system and although they are of a lower caste then nobles, they are extremely influential in Mali. In \"Status and Identity in West Africa: Nyamakalaw of Mande\", David C. Conrad also discusses the relationship between nobles and griots, writing: \"Another revealing aspect of the relationship between nobles and griots is the asymmetry of their mutual accountability. For example, nobles almost never blame individual griots for the general character of the group\". Conrad then goes on to describe how griots \"openly criticize nobles in public as well as in private\". Although griots are seen as being inferior to nobles, griots have no issue criticizing the faults of the family they work for. Such a willingness to criticize emphasizes the fact that griots do have in Mali despite their position in the caste system. Also included in Conrad's book is Cherif Keita's essay \"Jaliya in the Modern World: A Tribute to Banzumana Sissoko and Massa Makan Diabate\", in which Cherif Keita presents a \"tribute to contemporary bards\". Keita praises the griots and claims that griots \"have contributed positively to toward the building of a modern nation-state\". Contrary to beliefs that griots were seen as a part of a lower class, Keita presents an \"aristocratic view of contemporary griots\". Keita's perspective on griots provides a different outlook on the position of griots in modern Mali. Although griots are looked at as being a part of a low caste, griots have added to cultural and historical modern Mali society.\n\nIn modern-day Mali, griots are often singers or musicians. For example, Abdoulaye Diabaté, a singer from Mali, was born into a family of griots in 1956. Diabaté has a plethora of experience in contemporary and popular music. Baba Sissoko is also considered a Malian griot because he was born into a family of griots. Another griot from Mali, Toumani Diabaté, also has a plethora of experience in other forms of performing. Toumani Diabaté has experience in flamenco, blues and jazz.\n\n\n\n"}

It was discovered at the archaeological site of Caesarea Maritima in 1961. The artifact is particularly significant because it is an archaeological find of an authentic 1st-century Roman inscription mentioning the name \"Pontius Pilatus\". It is contemporary to Pilate's lifetime, and accords with what is known of his reported career. In effect, the writing constitutes the earliest surviving record and a contemporaneous evidence for the historical existence of this person; otherwise known from the New Testament, and brief mentions in retrospective Roman histories, which have themselves survived in still-later copies.\n\nIt is likely that Pontius Pilate made his base at Caesarea Maritima, a city that had replaced Jerusalem since AD 6 as the administrative capital and military headquarters of the province, and the site where the stone was discovered. Pilate probably travelled to Jerusalem, the central city of the province's Jewish population, only as often as necessary.\n\nThe \"Pilate stone\" is currently located at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Replica castings can be found at the Archaeological Museum in Milan, Italy, and on display in Caesarea Maritima itself.\n\nOn the partially damaged block is a dedication to the deified Augustus and Livia (\"the Divine Augusti\"), the stepfather and mother of emperor Tiberius, originally placed within a \"Tiberieum\", probably a temple dedicated to Tiberius. It has been deemed authentic because it was discovered in the coastal town of Caesarea, which was the capital of Iudaea Province during the time Pontius Pilate was Roman governor.\n\nThe partial inscription reads (conjectural letters in brackets):\n\nThe translation from Latin to English for the inscription reads:\n\nThe limestone block was discovered in June 1961 by Italian archaeologists led by Dr. Antonio Frova while excavating in the area of an ancient theatre built by decree of Herod the Great around 22–10 BC, along with the entire city of Caesarea.\n\nThe artifact is a fragment of the dedicatory inscription of a later building, probably a temple, that was constructed, possibly in honour of the emperor Tiberius, dating to 26–36 AD.\n\nThe stone was then reused in the 4th century as a building block for a set of stairs belonging to a structure erected behind the stage house of the Herodian theatre, and it was discovered there, still attached to the ancient staircase, by the archaeologists. The theatre is located in a town that was called Caesarea Maritima in the present-day city of Caesarea-on-the-Sea (also called Maritima).\n\n"}

{"id": "7093189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7093189", "title": "Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot", "text": "Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot\n\nThe Preliminary Discourse\" to the \"Encyclopedia\" of \"Diderot (\"Discours Préliminaire des Éditeurs\") is the primer to Denis Diderot's \"Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une Société de Gens de lettres\", a collaborative collection of all the known branches of the arts and sciences of the 18th century French Enlightenment. The \"Preliminary Discourse\" was written by Jean Le Rond d'Alembert to describe the structure of the articles included in the \"Encyclopédie\" and their philosophy, as well as to give the reader a strong background in the history behind the works of the learned men who contributed to what became the most profound circulation of the knowledge of the time.\n\n\"The Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot\" is arguably one of the best introductions to the French Enlightenment, giving forth the idea that man possesses the capability, through his own intelligence and analysis, to alter the conditions of human life. The \"Encyclopedia\" constituted a demand of the intellectual community for a refinement of all of the branches of knowledge in reference to past and recent discoveries. Such a compilation of human knowledge would be both secular and naturalistic, discrediting theology as the primary basis. The \"Discourse\", although created by d'Alembert, was actually a result of collaboration with other \"men of letters\" aiming towards the same progressive goals of the Enlightenment.Three of these major contemporary \"philosophes\" that undoubtedly contributed to the guiding philosophies and beliefs of the \"Discourse\" include Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, with whom d'Alembert was known to have been in contact. These men shared a passion for the dissemination of scientific knowledge. And, although this time period would seem unfavorable to such an endeavor, with Europe undergoing massive political upheaval and general instability, the time was ripe for their ideals to take hold. A thriving community of professionals, aristocrats, and clergy became increasingly responsive to the exchange of ideas that came to characterize and serve as the foundation for the cooperative compilation of information in this \"Encyclopedia\".\n\nBefore the \"Discourse\" was ever created, d'Alembert was actually better known for his scientific and mathematical genius. However, over time, and in part due to his vibrant personality, he befriended Madame du Deffand, whose powerful salon ultimately allowed him to enter the public eye as a philosophe. d'Alembert also became a close ally of Diderot, and eventually, d'Alembert was a man who was held in very high regard among Europe's intellectuals. Ultimately, d'Alembert's tendency to turn more to history to explain the foundations of science and ethics reflects a general historical trend to seek enlightenment and better understanding of human nature in history. Ultimately, the Discourse defines two ways of approaching ideas, one of which being operations of the \"isolated mind\" (xli) and the other concerning studies of the origins of truth as a function of the progress of a given society. Although the Discourse derives much of its fundamental principles from men such as René Descartes, John Locke and Condillac in a purely metaphysical sense, the effect of historical experience is vital.\n\nIt is important to note that while the philosophes began the intellectual transformations that became known as the French Enlightenment, scientists all over Europe began to make their own changes in terms of new discoveries, areas they felt required further study, and how they could go about such studies, i.e. their methodology. Many of these new scientists felt that they were rebelling against old forms of science and scientific knowledge, just as the philosophes felt that they were bringing to the world a new way of thinking about humanity and human knowledge. The philosophes were aware of these changes in the field of science, and as such, they fully supported, and arguably adapted, the scientists's new systems of thinking into their philosophical ideas. One can see this in the \"Discourse\" itself; d'Alembert attempted to create a method of systematizing and organizing all legitimate information and knowledge as well as make easier and more efficient the unearthing of more knowledge.\n\nD'Alembert's motives behind such an enterprise can ultimately be referenced to one of the ideas that he puts forth in the Discourse, for \"liberty of action and thought alone is capable of producing great things, and liberty requires only enlightenment to preserve it from excess\" (62). Clerical control in the domain of knowledge and intellect was considered detrimental to the progress of human knowledge. Maintaining that the Discourse was ultimately corrosive to hierarchical authority and privilege paved the way for the evolution of egalitarian principles in Western culture. D'Alembert puts forth that all men are equal in their sensations, which is the source of their mind. The ultimate distinction of man is primarily intellectual, which overthrows any preconceived connection between social privilege and knowledge. Therefore, the Encyclopedia as a whole speaks to the general public.\n\nIn part one of the book, d'Alembert provides a general introduction to the origin of knowledge, which led to the works found in the \"Encyclopédie\". He asserts that the \"existence of our senses\" is \"indisputable,\" and that these senses are thus the principle of all knowledge. He links this idea to a chain of thinking and reflection that eventually leads to the need to communicate, which sets another chain of events in effect. One of his arguments for the origin of communication is that it was necessary for people to protect themselves from the evils of the world and to benefit from each other's knowledge. This communication led to the exchange of ideas that enhanced the ability of individuals to further human knowledge. Additionally, d'Alembert introduces the reader to the types of knowledge people store. The two main types that he describes refer to direct and reflexive knowledge. Direct knowledge is obtained by human senses and reflexive knowledge is derived from direct knowledge. These two types of knowledge lead to the three main types of thinking and their corresponding divisions of human knowledge: memory, which corresponds with History; reflection or reason, which is the basis of Philosophy; and what d'Alembert refers to as \"imagination,\" (50) or imitation of Nature, which produces Fine Arts.\n\nFrom these divisions spring smaller subdivisions such as physics, poetry, music and many others. d'Alembert was also greatly influenced by the Cartesian principle of simplicity. In this first part of the book, he describes how the reduction of the principles of a certain science gives them scope and makes them more \"fertile\" (22). Only by reducing principles can they be understood and related to each other. Ultimately, from a high \"vantage point\" (47) the philosopher can then view the vast labyrinth of sciences and the arts. d'Alembert then goes on to describe the tree of knowledge and the separation and simultaneous connections between memory, reason, and imagination. He later explains that the ideal universe would be one gigantic truth if one only knew how to view it as such; the assumption that knowledge has intrinsic unity can be seen as the foundation of the project of making the encyclopedia.\n\nPart two of the book provides the reader with an account of the progress of human knowledge in the sequence of memory, imagination and reason. This sequence is different from the one described in Part I, where the sequence is memory, reason, and imagination. It is the sequence a mind left in isolation or the original generation follows whereas in Part II he describes the progress of human knowledge in the centuries of enlightenment that started from erudition, continued with belles-lettres, and reached to philosophy.\n\nInstead of writing in terms of general ideas, d'Alembert provides the dates, places and people responsible for the progress of literary works since the Renaissance leading up to his date. One key example is René Descartes, who the author lauds as both an excellent philosopher and mathematician. His application of algebra to geometry, also known as the Cartesian coordinate system, provided an excellent tool for the physical sciences. He focuses on the importance of ancient knowledge and the ability to understand and build on it. Reference is made that concepts of knowledge could not have advanced as quickly had there not been ancient works to imitate and surpass. He also clarifies that there can be disadvantages to the ability to retrieve information from the past. Noted in the text is the lack of improvement in philosophy in comparison to other advancements due to the ignorant belief that ancient philosophy could not be questioned. d'Alembert claims that it would be ignorant to perceive that everything could be known about a particular subject. Additionally, he makes an attempt to show how individuals could free their minds from the yoke of authority. His use of deductive logic provides a more philosophical base for the existence of God. He makes clear that all sciences are restricted as much as can be to facts and that opinion influences science as little as possible. d'Alembert states that philosophy is far more effective at the analysis of our perceptions when the \"soul is in a state of tranquility\", when it is not caught up in passion and emotion (96). He believes that the philosopher is key in furthering the fields of science. The philosopher must be able to stand back and observe science and nature with an impartial eye. Furthermore, the importance of science and the advancements of such intellects as Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Descartes, John Locke and others are explained.\n\nPart three of the book concludes by detailing the important attributes of the writing of the \"Encyclopédie\" and by mentioning important contributors. d'Alembert discusses how the \"Encyclopédie\" is open to changes and additions from others since it is a work of many centuries. In addition, he states that an omission in an encyclopedia is harmful to its substance which differs from an omission in a dictionary. d'Alembert also states the three categories of the Encyclopédie, which are the sciences, the liberal arts and the mechanical arts. He states that it is important that these subcategories remain separate and concludes with the fact that society must judge the Preliminary Discourse to the \"Encyclopedia\" of Diderot.\n\nAt the end of the book, d'Alembert includes a detailed explanation of the system of human knowledge. This includes a chart entitled \"Figurative System of Human Knowledge\", which divides human understanding into its three constituents: memory, reason, and imagination. The chart then subdivides each of the three major categories into many other categories of human understanding. After his chart d'Alembert goes on to provide a detailed explanation of every division and subdivision apparent in his chart. The chart establishes a complex genealogy of knowledge and the way man has subdivided knowledge into the specific areas he feels they are applicable. It is important to remember that no one of these systems of human knowledge plays a more significant role than any of the others. These systems are designed around the idea that each uses the other two to build upon itself and further human knowledge as a whole. In context the chart shows a progression of knowledge through the ages, memory being the past, reason being the present, which examines and tries to either build or create new theories based on memory, and imagination which focuses on making new assumptions or theories about things in our human universe.\n\nThe method of the \"Discourse\" and the \"Encyclopedia\" marked a shift from Descartes’ rationalism toward the empiricism of John Locke and Isaac Newton. In the \"Discourse\", d’Alembert rejects a priori, indemonstrable speculations that lead to error and “intellectual despotism” and assumes a method based on hard facts and evidence (xxxv). A main objective of the “Encyclopedia” was not only to organize a collection of known information, but also to establish a cohesive method of gathering facts and principles yet to be discovered. D’Alembert acknowledges that “it is no less difficult to encompass the infinitely varied branches of human knowledge in a truly unified system,” (5), yet despite this seemingly formidable task, D’Alembert succeeds in fulfilling the purpose of the Encyclopedia, which was to gather all the facets of knowledge into one unified text, and to compile knowledge in a way that it could be standardized and compartmentalized into different categories. With this method, d’Alembert believed the \"philosophes\" could create a system of knowledge that would be unified and systematized, but not so rigid and strict as to impose limits on the search for new facts. A classic example of this systematized approach is the aforementioned \"figurative system of human knowledge\", which quantifies knowledge by dividing it into three categories: memory, reason, and imagination. The purpose of this was to place knowledge within general framework that could be added to or expounded upon if necessary. As Richard Schwab, who translated the text, states in the introduction, d’Alembert believed the “Discourse of method” would give mankind the power to independently shape and direct its own destiny. This method provided an answer to the growing demand of the intellectual community of Europe to create a synthesis of information based upon secular and naturalistic principles rather than upon a theological teleology (xxxi), and to disseminate knowledge throughout the entire population, no longer being restricted to the wealthy, academic elite.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was first founded in 1926. Amateur theatre companies in Scotland have generally presented repertoire in English, Lowland Scots and, more occasionally, Scottish Gaelic. \n\nThe SCDA was founded during the period of the Scottish Renaissance, a time of increasing calls to revive many of the cultural and political institutions in Scotland which were perceived as moribund at this period, including native theatre. Serious professional theatre in Scotland had more or less lapsed by the 1880s and the first twentieth century attempt to revive it faltered with the demise of Alfred Wareing's short-lived Glasgow Repertory Theatre (founded in 1909) which closed down on the outbreak of World War I. Its remaining funds were used in the early 1920s to found the amateur Scottish National Players with the goal to promote native theatre. During the interwar years all such initiatives had their origins in the amateur theatre movement, in particular Glasgow's Curtain Theatre (1932–39) founded by Grace Ballantyne, Scottish People's Theatre and Glasgow Unity. \n\nNo teaching institutions offered formal provision for training in Scottish styles of performance or diction until the establishment of the Glasgow College of Dramatic Art in 1950 (as part of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music). as a consequence, most of Scotland's ground-breaking mid-twentieth century native actors, such as Duncan Macrae, Roddy McMillan or Molly Urquhart, first developed their skills and methods through performance with the more innovative non-professional companies listed above. Similarly, native playwrights who wished to present authentic representations of Scottish life on the stage, such as Joe Corrie, Robert McLellan, John Brandane, Ena Lamont Stewart and others, first came to attention generally through amateur productions of their plays. \n\nLowland Scots playwrights in particular were well served by non-professional theatre at a time when voicing for professional actors in Britain was dictated by received pronunciation. Miscasting in professional productions of McLellan's Scots plays was a regular complaint for the playwright, often in contrast to amateur productions of his Scots in which actors without formal training gave sympathetic and authentic delivery of the language. \n\nAfter James Bridie's establishment of the Citizens Theatre in 1942, Scotland finally began to develop a native professional theatre. \n\nAfter the introduction of television during the 1950s, the number of amateur companies in Scotland, in common with the situation elsewhere, began to decline from its peak in the 1940s, but it still remains a vigorous part of Scottish cultural life. \n\nThe SCDA has maintained a successful annual one-act drama festival since its inception, with one interregnum of five years (1940–45) during the Second World War.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8965501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8965501", "title": "Seder Olam Rabbah", "text": "Seder Olam Rabbah\n\nSeder Olam Rabbah (, \"The Great Order of the World\") is a 2nd-century CE Hebrew language chronology detailing the dates of biblical events from the Creation to Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia. It adds no stories beyond what is in the biblical text, and addresses such questions as the age of Isaac at the binding and the number of years that Joshua led the Israelites. Tradition considers it to have been written about 160 CE by Yose ben Halafta, which is not unreasonable, but it was probably also supplemented and edited at a later period . In the Babylonian Talmud this chronicle is several times referred to simply as the \"Seder Olam\" (Shab. 88a; Yeb. 82b; Nazir 5a; Meg. 11b; Ab. Zarah 8b; Niddah 46b), and it is quoted as such by the more ancient Biblical commentators, including Rashi. But with the 12th century it began to be designated as \"Seder Olam Rabbah,\" to distinguish it from a later, smaller chronicle, \"Seder Olam Zuṭa\"; it was first so designated by Abraham ben Nathan - also known as Ha-Yarhi (\"Ha-Manhig,\" p. 2a, Berlin, 1855).\n\nIn its present form the \"Seder Olam Rabbah\" consists of 30 chapters, each 10 chapters forming a section, or \"gate.\"\n\nThe work is a chronological record, extending from Adam to the revolt of Bar Kokba in the reign of Hadrian, the Persian period being compressed into 52 years . The chronicle is complete only up to the time of Alexander the Great; the period from Alexander to Hadrian occupies a very small portion of the work—the end of the 30th chapter.\n\nIt has been concluded, therefore, that originally the \"Seder Olam\" was more extensive and consisted of two parts, the second of which, dealing with the post-Alexandrian period, has been lost, with the exception of a small fragment that was added by the copyists to the first part.\n\nMany passages quoted in the Talmud are missing in the edition of the \"Seder Olam\" which has survived.\n\nThe author probably designed the work for calendrical purposes, to determine the era of the creation; his system, adopted as early as the 3rd century, is still followed. Adhering closely to the Pharisaic interpretations of Bible texts, he endeavored not only to elucidate many passages, but also to determine certain dates which are not indicated in the Bible, but which may be inferred by calculation.\n\nIn many cases, however, he gave the dates according to tradition, and inserted, besides, the sayings and halakot of preceding rabbis and of his contemporaries. In discussing Biblical chronology he followed three principles:\n\nThe application of these principles would obviously have had the effect of compressing the Biblical chronology. The following examples will illustrate the manner in which these principles are applied.\n\nThe confusion of languages in Genesis is said to have taken place in the days of Peleg (). The author concludes that the first year of Peleg's life cannot be meant, as at the time of the confusion Peleg had a younger brother, Joktan, and the latter had several children; nor could it have occurred during the middle years of his life, for Peleg lived 239 years, and the designation \"middle years\" is not an exact one (); had the redactor intended to indicate only a general period, he would have used the phrase \"in the days of Peleg and Joktan.\" The Bible must therefore mean that the confusion of languages took place in the last year of Peleg's life, and by comparing the dates of the previous generations, the author concluded that it occurred 340 years after the Flood, or 1996 years after the creation of the world.\n\nAfter dealing in the first 10 chapters with the chronology of the period from the creation of the world to the death of Moses, the writer proceeds to determine the dates of the events which occurred after the Israelites, led by Joshua, entered the Holy Land. Here Biblical chronology presents many difficulties, dates not being clearly given, and in many cases the \"Seder Olam\" was used by the later Biblical commentators as a basis of exegesis. Thus, it is known that from the entry of the Israelites into the Holy Land to the time of Jephthah a period of 300 years elapsed (). By computing the life periods of the Judges and assuming that Jephthah sent his message, in which he alluded to the 300 years, in the second year of his rulership, the writer concluded that the reign of Joshua lasted 28 years. It may be added that he placed the making of the image for Micah () and the destruction of nearly the whole tribe of Benjamin in consequence of the wrong done to the Levite and his concubine in Gibeah () in the time of Othniel.\n\nIt is further stated that Solomon began to build the Temple in Jerusalem in the fourth year of his reign, 480 years after the Exodus (), that is, 440 years after the Israelites entered the Holy Land. Thus there was a period of 140 years from the second year of Jephthah to the building of the Temple. The author of the \"Seder 'Olam\" concluded that the forty years during which the Israelites were harassed by the Philistines (Judges 13:1) did not begin after the death of Abdon, as it would seem, but after that of Jephthah, and terminated with the death of Samson. Consequently, there was a period of 83 years from the second year of Jephthah to the death of Eli, who ruled 40 years (I Sam. 4:18), the last year of Samson being the first of Eli's judgeship. At that time the Tabernacle was removed from Shiloh, whither it had been transferred from Gilgal, where it had been for 14 years under Joshua; consequently it remained at Shiloh for a period of 369 years, standing all that time on a stone foundation. It is also to be concluded that Samuel judged Israel for 11 years, which with the two years of Saul (ib. 13:2), the 40 of David's reign (I Kings 2:11), and the four of Solomon's reign, make 57 years, during which the Tabernacle was first at Nob, then at Gibeon.\n\nThe chronology of the Kings was more difficult, as there were differences to reconcile between the book of Kings and book of Chronicles. Here especially the author applied the principle of \"fragments of years\" (\"shanim meḳuṭṭa'ot\"), by which he regarded the remainder of the last year of any king's reign as identical with the first year of his successor's. In the 20th chapter, which closes the second part (\"Baba Meẓia\"), the author deals with the forty-eight prophets that flourished in the land of Israel. Beginning with Joshua, the author reviews the whole prophetic period which terminated with Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, elucidating as he proceeds many obscure points. Thus, the prophet mentioned in Judges vi. 8 was, according to the \"Seder 'Olam,\" Phinehas, and the man of God that came to Eli (I Sam. 2:27) was Elkanah.\n\nThe prophecy of Obadiah occurred in the time of Amaziah, King of Judah (comp., however, Yalḳ., Obad.), and those of Joel, Nahum, and Habakkuk in the reign of Manasseh. After devoting the 21st chapter to the prophets that lived before the conquest of the land, to the seven prophetesses, and to the seven prophets of the Gentiles, the author resumes the chronology of the Kings. He continues it to the end of ch. xxvii., where he reaches the destruction of the Temple, which, according to his computation, occurred after it had existed 410 years, or 3,338 years after the creation of the world. Then follow the 70 years of the Captivity and the 420 years of the Second Temple, which was destroyed, as may be seen, in the year 3828 of the Creation.\n\nThe 420 years of the Second Temple are divided into the following periods: the domination of the Persians at the time when the Temple stood, 34 years; of the Greeks, 180 years; of the Maccabees, 103 years; of the Herods, 103 years. It can be seen that the allowance, contrary to historical facts, of only 34 years for the Persian domination is necessary if the \"Seder 'Olam\" chronology is to agree with the Pharisaic Talmudical interpretation (of Dan. 9:24) that the second exile was to take place after 70 Sabbaths of years (= 490 years) from an \"issuing forth of a word\" to rebuild Jerusalem. If from this period of 490 years the 70 years of the first Captivity is deducted, and the beginning of Alexander's domination over the Land of Israel is placed, in accordance with Talmudical tradition, at 386 years before the destruction of the Second Temple, then there remain only 34 for the Persian rule. Alternatively, what seems to be a historical inaccuracy in \"Seder ‘Olam\" has been explained in a different way. According to RASHI, the 34-year Persian period must be understood in the context of their hegemony over Israel while the Second Temple stood. Meaning, 34 years is the precise timeframe between the building of the Second Temple under Darius (II) in 352 BCE (according to Jewish calculations) and Alexander the Great's rise to power in 318 BCE – collected altogether as 34 years of Persian hegemony over Israel while the Temple stood. This timeframe, therefore, does not signify the end of the dynasties in Persia, but rather of their rule and hegemony over Israel before Alexander the Great rose to power. Likewise, the period of Herodian rule over Israel, namely, 103 years, refers merely to its hegemony over Israel while the Temple was still standing. The beginning of this period is reckoned during Herod the Great's reign in 35 BCE and ends in 68 CE with the destruction of the Second Temple (based on Jewish computations) – although in essence, Herod's dynasty continued long thereafter.\n\nFrom the destruction of the Second Temple, which, according to the \"Seder 'Olam,\" occurred at the end of the last week of a Sabbatical year, to the suppression of Bar Kokba's revolt (or the destruction of Bethar) is given as a period of 52 years. But the text here is very confused and has given rise to various emendations and interpretations, as the historical date for the destruction of the Second Temple is 70 C.E. and that for the conclusion of the Bar Kokba revolt is 135 C.E. (comp. Salzer in Berliner's \"Magazin,\" 4:141 et seq.).\n\nAssuming that this \"Seder Olam\" is the same as the \"Seder Olam\" mentioned in the Talmud, Jewish authorities generally ascribe its authorship to the well-known Talmudist Jose b. Halafta, on the strength of R. Johanan's statement, \"The tanna of the 'Seder 'Olam' was R. Jose\" (Yeb. 82b; Niddah 46b). Johanan's comment is supported by the fact that Jose was known as one who occupied himself with Jewish chronology; further, many sayings of R. Jose's quoted in the Talmud are paralleled in the \"Seder Olam.'\nObjecting, however, that the \"Seder Olam\" often conflicts with opinions of Jose's expressed in the Talmud, that Jose is referred to in it in the third person (\"R. Jose said\"), and finally that mention is made in it of Talmudists that lived later than Jose, Ratner (\"Mabo leha-Seder 'Olam Rabbah,\" Wilna, 1894) concludes that Jose was not its author; he thinks that Jose was only the principal authority of the \"Seder 'Olam,\" and that Johanan's statement, mentioned above, is similar to another statement made by him—\"Any anonymous opinion in the Mishnah belongs to R. Meïr\" (Sanh. 86a), although the redactor of the Mishnah was Judah I. Ratner further supposes that R. Johanan himself compiled the work, following generally the opinion of R. Jose. He endeavors to prove this view by showing that many utterances of R. Johanan are taken from the \"Seder Olam.\"\n\nRatner's objections, however, are answered by other scholars, who think that in the \"Seder 'Olam\" Jose preserved the generally accepted opinions, even when they were contrary to his own, as is clearly indicated in Niddah (l.c.). Besides, this work, like all the works of the ancient Talmudists, underwent many alternations at the hands of the copyists. Very often, too, finding that the utterance of a later rabbi agreed with the \"Seder 'Olam,\" the copyists inserted the name of that rabbi. A careful examination shows that certain additions are later than the latest midrashim, and it may be that Abraham ibn Yarḥi (l.c.), Isaac Lattes (\"Sha'are Ẓiyyon,\" p. 25), and Menahem Meïri (introduction to Abot, p. 14), who seem to place the redaction of the \"Seder 'Olam\" at the time when the Massektot (tractates) Derek Ereẓ Rabbah, the Derek Ereẓ Zuṭa, the Soferim, and other later treatises were composed, may have referred to the work in its present form.\n\nBesides directly quoting the \"Seder 'Olam,\" the Talmud often alludes to it under \"tanya\" (= \"we learned\") \"tana\" (= \"he learned\"), \"tanu rabbanan\" (= \"our teachers learned\"), \"amar mar\" (= \"the teacher said\"): often the sentences following these phrases are found in the \"Seder 'Olam.\" In addition, many of its passages have been taken into the Mishnah without any allusion to their source. The \"Seder 'Olam\" is not mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud, although several passages in the latter are based on it. Finally, many of the sayings of the \"Seder 'Olam\" have been taken into the Mekilta, the Sifra, and the Sifre.\n\n\nThe current Hebrew calendar year numbering system, which counts years from the creation, has been in use for more than 1000 years. The year numbering system was adopted sometime before 3925 Anno Mundi (165 CE), and based on the calculation of Rabbi Yose ben Halafta during about 160 CE in the book Seder Olam Rabbah.\n\nThe year numbers are based on the computations of dates and periods found in the Hebrew Bible. In Jewish tradition, \"Year 1\" is considered to have begun on the 25 of Elul, 6 days before the beginning of \"Year 2\" on the first of Tishrei, when Adam was created. The new moon of its first month (Tishrei) is designated \"molad tohu\" (meaning new moon of chaos or nothing). By Halafta's calculation Adam was created during the year 3761 BCE. However, \"Seder Olam Rabbah\" treats the creation of Adam as the beginning of \"Year Zero\". This results in a two-year discrepancy between the years given in \"Seder Olam Rabbah\" and the Jewish year used now. For example, \"Seder Olam Rabbah\" gives the year of the Exodus from Egypt as 2448 AM; but, according to the current system, the year would be 2450 AM.\n\nDespite the computations by Yose ben Halafta, confusion persisted for a long time as to how the calculations should be applied. During 1000, for example, the Muslim chronologist al-Biruni noted that three different epochs were used by various Jewish communities being one, two, or three years later than the modern epoch. The epoch seems to have been settled by 1178, when Maimonides, in his work \"Mishneh Torah\", described all of the modern rules of the Hebrew calendar, including the modern epochal year. His work has been accepted by Jews as definitive, though it does not correspond to the scientific calculations. For example, the Jewish year for the destruction of the First Temple has traditionally been given as 3338 AM or 421/2 BCE. This differs from the modern scientific year, which is usually expressed using the Proleptic Julian calendar as 587 BCE. The scientific date takes into account evidence from the ancient Babylonian calendar and its astronomical observations. So, too, according to Jewish computation, the destruction of the Second Temple occurred in the lunar month of Av in \"anno\" 68 CE, rather than in 70 CE. In this and related cases, a difference between the traditional Jewish year and a scientific date in a Gregorian year or in a proleptic Julian calendar date results from a disagreement about when the event happened—and not simply a difference between the Jewish and Gregorian calendars (See the \"Missing Years\" in the Jewish Calendar and below, \"Excursus: Jewish Chronology in the Scroll of Antiochus\").\n\nIn Jewish thought the counting is usually considered to be to the creation of the world, as has been emphasized in many ancient texts dealing with creation chronology that the six days of creation till man are literal days—including the days before the creation of the sun and earth. However, some understand these days metaphorically.\n\nThe modern epoch year is set at 3761 BCE, taking into account that there is no year zero in the Julian year count.\n\nHowever Rav Saadiah Gaon (10th Century CE) and Rav Hai Gaon (11th Century CE) note that the years dated to creation cited in the Talmud and in Seder Olam are 1 year off from the modern Hebrew calendar. While the modern Hebrew calendar's Year 1 is from the 25th of Elul in the Year of Chaos (Tohu), the Talmud and Seder Olam's Year 1 is from the 1 Tishrei - the creation of Adam. Thus Year 1 in the Talmud and Seder Olam is actually Year 2 in today's Hebrew Calendar.\n\nTherefore, when calculating to the year of creation from Seder Olam, Taking into account the 1 year mentioned above; as well as the fact that there is no year \"0\", as the year before 1 CE is 1 BCE, not 0, we arrive at the number 3760 BCE as the Year 1 of the modern Hebrew calendar.\n\nAccording to the Aramaic Scroll of Antiochus, from the Second Temple's rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes who invaded Judaea, there had transpired 213 years in total. Quoting verbatim from that ancient Aramaic record:\nבִּשׁנַת עַסרִין וּתלָת שְׁנִין לְמִמלְכֵיהּ, בִּשׁנַת מָאתַן וּתלָת עֲסַר שְׁנִין לְבִניַין בֵּית אֱלָהָא דֵיך, שַׁוִּי אַנפּוֹהִי לְמִיסַּק לִירוּשְׁלֵם\n\nLiteral translation: \"In the twenty third year of his kingdom, in the two-hundred and thirteenth year of the rebuilding of this, God's house, he (Antiochus Eupator) put his face to go up to Jerusalem.\"\n\nThis timeframe is taken in conjunction with another date in the Seleucid Era counting mentioned by Josephus, in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (book 12, chapter 9, section 2). Based on Josephus' record, Antiochus Eupator began his reign after his father's death (Antiochus Epiphanes) in \"anno\" 149 of the Seleucid Era (= 162 BCE). Twenty-three years into Antiochus Eupator's reign would have then been \"anno\" 172 of the Seleucid Era, or what was then 139 BCE. Since, according to the Scroll of Antiochus, the Second Temple had already been standing 213 years, this means that the Second Temple was completed in \"anno\" 352 BCE, being what was then the 6th year of the reign of Darius the king (i.e. Darius, the son of Hystaspes), the year in which the king finished its building according to Ezra 6:15. Although this date of the Temple's rebuilding largely disagrees with modern scholarship who base their chronologies upon the Babylonian Chronicles and its rebuilding in 516 BCE, it is, nonetheless, held by religious Jewish circles as being accurate and reliable, since it is founded upon a tradition passed down generation after generation. The Babylonian Chronicles, however, are known to be lacking in certain regnal years ascribed to some kings, besides disagreeing in other places with the ancient Egyptian records outlining the regnal years of eight successive Persian kings, preserved in the Third Book of Manetho. In Jewish tradition, the Second Temple stood 420 years, meaning, it was destroyed by Titus in the 2nd year of the reign of Vespasian, in 68 CE.

In Latin \"Siculicidium\" \"murder of Székelys\" was a mass murder committed against Székelys by the Habsburg army in 1764, under Maria Theresa.\n\nIn 1763, the Court of Vienna entrusted general Adolf Nikolaus von Buccow to set up three Székely and two Romanian regiments to patrol the borders. However, the Székelys were unwilling to give up their hundred-year tradition of soldiering and their privileges. Thus, they resisted the forced military draft and organized a revolt against it. Maria Theresa appointed a new general, Joseph von Siskovics, who commanded his soldiers to attack Csík-Madéfalva (present-day Siculeni), where the Székely leaders were supposed to meet in a council. It was under the darkness of the snowy night of January 7, 1764 that the Habsburg soldiers entered the village and massacred about 400 unsuspecting people, including women and children.\n\nThe following days, the Székely leaders were captured and impeached, while thousands of terrified Székelys started to migrate to Moldavia, where they took refuge in the villages of the Csángómagyars who had been living there for centuries. In 1774, the Habsburg soldiers took control of an area of Moldavia that would eventually be named Bukovina and – after the intervention of Count András Hadik – they pardoned the Székelys there and settled them down. There, the Székelys founded settlements of their own. The five villages of the Székelys of Bukovina were: Istensegíts (\"God help us!\", now Ţibeni, 1776), Fogadjisten (\"Accept God's will!\", now ), Józseffalva (now Vornicenii Mari, 1785), Hadikfalva (now Dornești) and Andrásfalva (Măneuţi, 1786).\n\nThe events remained vivid in the Székely collective memory: in 1905, an obelisk was erected at Madéfalva, on its top carrying a Turul-bird with the wings spread. At the bottom of the stone-pyramid there is a plate with the word \"SICVLICIDIVM\" on it (oddly enough, adding up the values of the letters as Roman numerals, the result is exactly the year of the massacre).\n\nSince the Székelys of Bukovina came into existence as a consequence of the events of January 7, 1764, they celebrate this day as the community's birthday.\n\n"}
{"id": "80757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80757", "title": "Teleology", "text": "Teleology\n\nTeleology or finality is a reason or explanation for something in function of its end, purpose, or goal. It is derived from two Greek words: telos (end, goal, purpose) and logos (reason, explanation). A purpose that is imposed by a human use, such as that of a fork, is called \"extrinsic\". Natural teleology, common in classical philosophy but controversial today, contends that natural entities also have \"intrinsic\" purposes, irrespective of human use or opinion. For instance, Aristotle claimed that an acorn's intrinsic \"telos\" is to become a fully grown oak tree.\n\nThough ancient atomists rejected the notion of natural teleology, teleological accounts of non-personal or non-human nature were explored and often endorsed in ancient and medieval philosophies, but fell into disfavor during the modern era (1600–1900). In the late 18th century, Immanuel Kant used the concept of telos as a regulative principle in his \"Critique of Judgment\". Teleology was also fundamental to the speculative philosophy of Georg Hegel.\n\nContemporary philosophers and scientists are still discussing whether teleological axioms are useful or accurate in proposing modern philosophies and scientific theories. For instance, in 2012, Thomas Nagel proposed a non-Darwinian account of evolution that incorporates impersonal and natural teleological laws to explain the existence of life, consciousness, rationality, and objective value. Regardless, the accuracy can also be considered independently from the usefulness: it is a common experience in pedagogy that a minimum of apparent teleology can be useful in thinking about and explaining Darwinian evolution even if there is no true teleology driving evolution. Thus it is easier to say that evolution \"gave\" wolves sharp canine teeth because those teeth \"serve the purpose of\" predation regardless of whether there is an underlying nonteleologic reality in which evolution is not an actor with intentions. In other words, because human cognition and learning often rely on the narrative structure of stories (with actors, goals, and proximal rather than distal causation), some minimal level of teleology might be recognized as useful or at least tolerable for practical purposes even by people who reject its cosmologic accuracy. \n\nThe word \"teleology\" builds on the Greek τέλος, \"telos\" (root: τελε-, \"end, purpose\") and -λογία, \"logia\", \"a branch of learning\". The German philosopher Christian von Wolff coined the term (in the Latin form \"teleologia\") in 1728 in his work \"Philosophia rationalis, sive logica\".\n\nIn western philosophy, the term and concept of teleology originated in the writings of Plato and Aristotle. Aristotle's Four Causes give special place to each thing's telos or \"final cause.\" In this, he followed Plato in seeing purpose in both human and sub-human nature.\n\nIn the \"Phaedo\", Plato through Socrates argues that true explanations for any given physical phenomenon must be teleological. He bemoans those who fail to distinguish between a thing's necessary and sufficient causes, which he identifies respectively as material and final causes (\"Phaedo\" 98–99):\n\nPlato here argues that while the materials that compose a body are necessary conditions for its moving or acting in a certain way, they nevertheless cannot be the \"sufficient\" condition for its moving or acting as it does. For example (given in \"Phaedo\" 98), if Socrates is sitting in an Athenian prison, the elasticity of his tendons is what allows him to be sitting, and so a physical description of his tendons can be listed as \"necessary conditions\" or \"auxiliary causes\" of his act of sitting (\"Phaedo\" 99b; \"Timaeus\" 46c9–d4, 69e6). However, these are only necessary conditions of Socrates' sitting. To give a physical description of Socrates' body is to say \"that\" Socrates is sitting, but it does not give us any idea why \"it came to be\" that he was sitting in the first place. To say why he was sitting and not \"not\" sitting, we have to explain what it is about his sitting that is \"good\", for all things brought about (i.e., all products of actions) are brought about because the actor saw some good in them. Thus, to give an explanation of something is to determine what about it is good. Its goodness is its \"actual cause\"—its purpose, \"telos\" or \"reason for which\" (\"Timaeus\" 27d8–29a).\n\nAristotle argued that Democritus was wrong to attempt to reduce all things to mere necessity, because doing so neglects the aim, order, and \"final cause\", which brings about these necessary conditions:\n\nIn the \"Physics\" Aristotle rejected Plato's assumption that the universe was created by an intelligent designer using eternal forms as his model. For Aristotle, natural ends are produced by \"natures\" (principles of change internal to living things), and natures, Aristotle argued, do not deliberate: \nThese Platonic and Aristotelian arguments ran counter to those presented earlier by Democritus and later by Lucretius, both of whom were supporters of what is now often called accidentalism:\n\nSince the \"Novum Organum\" of Francis Bacon, teleological explanations in physical science tend to be deliberately avoided in favor of focus on material and efficient explanations. Final and formal causation came to be viewed as false or too subjective. Nonetheless, some disciplines, in particular within evolutionary biology, continue to use language that appears teleological when they describe natural tendencies towards certain end conditions; although some argue that these arguments ought to be, and practicably can be, rephrased in non-teleological forms, others hold that teleological language cannot always be \"easily\" expunged from descriptions in the life sciences, at least within the bounds of practical pedagogy. This is discussed further below.\n\nA teleology of human aims played a crucial role in the work of Ludwig von Mises especially in the development of his science of praxeology. More specifically he believed that human action, i.e. purposeful behavior, is teleological based on the presupposition that an individual's action is governed or caused by the existence of their chosen ends. Or in other words an individual selects what they believe to be the most appropriate means to achieve a sought after goal or end. Mises however also stressed that teleology with respect to human action was by no means independent of causality as he states \"no action can be devised and ventured upon without definite ideas about the relation of cause and effect, teleology presupposes causality\"\n\nHistorically, teleology may be identified with the philosophical tradition of Aristotelianism. The rationale of teleology was explored by Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Judgement and, again, made central to speculative philosophy by Hegel and in the various neo-Hegelian schools proposing a history of our species some consider to be at variance with Darwin, as well as with the dialectical materialism of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and with what is now called analytic philosophy the point of departure is not so much formal logic and scientific fact but 'identity'. (In Hegel's terminology: 'objective spirit'.)\n\nIndividual human consciousness, in the process of reaching for autonomy and freedom, has no choice but to deal with an obvious reality: the collective identities (such as the multiplicity of world views, ethnic, cultural and national identities) that divide the human race and set (and always have set) different groups in violent conflict with each other. Hegel conceived of the 'totality' of mutually antagonistic world-views and life-forms in history as being 'goal-driven', that is, oriented towards an end-point in history. The 'objective contradiction' of 'subject' and 'object' would eventually 'sublate' into a form of life that leaves violent conflict behind. This goal-oriented, 'teleological' notion of the 'historical process as a whole' is present in a variety of 20th-century authors, although its prominence declined drastically after the Second World War.\n\nIn contrast, teleological based \"grand narratives\" are eschewed by the postmodern attitude and teleology may be viewed as reductive, exclusionary and harmful to those whose stories are diminished or overlooked.\n\nAgainst this postmodern position, Alasdair MacIntyre has argued that a narrative understanding of oneself, of one's capacity as an independent reasoner, one's dependence on others and on the social practices and traditions in which one participates, all tend towards an ultimate good of liberation. Social practices may themselves be understood as teleologically oriented to internal goods, for example practices of philosophical and scientific inquiry are teleologically ordered to the elaboration of a true understanding of their objects. MacIntyre's book \"After Virtue\" famously dismissed the naturalistic teleology of Aristotle's 'metaphysical biology', but he has cautiously moved from that book's account of a sociological teleology toward an exploration of what remains valid in a more traditional teleological naturalism.\n\nTeleology informs the study of ethics.\n\nBusiness people commonly think in terms of purposeful action as in, for example, management by objectives. Teleological analysis of business ethics leads to consideration of the full range of stakeholders in any business decision, including the management, the staff, the customers, the shareholders, the country, humanity and the environment.\n\nTeleology provides a moral basis for the professional ethics of medicine, as physicians are generally concerned with outcomes and must therefore know the \"telos\" of a given treatment paradigm.\n\nThe broad spectrum of consequentialist ethics, of which utilitarianism is a well-known example, focuses on the end result or consequences, with such principles as utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill's \"the greatest good for the greatest number\", or the Principle of Utility. Hence, this principle is teleological, but in a broader sense than is elsewhere understood in philosophy. In the classical notion, teleology is grounded in the inherent natures of things themselves, whereas in consequentialism, teleology is imposed on nature from outside by the human will. Consequentialist theories justify inherently what most people would call evil acts by their desirable outcomes, if the good of the outcome outweighs the bad of the act. So, for example, a consequentialist theory would say it was acceptable to kill one person in order to save two or more other people. These theories may be summarized by the maxim \"the ends can justify the means.\"\n\nConsequentialism stands in contrast to the more classical notions of deontological ethics, such as Immanuel Kant's Categorical Imperative, and Aristotle's virtue ethics (although formulations of virtue ethics are also often consequentialist in derivation). In deontological ethics, the goodness or badness of individual acts is primary and a desirable larger goal is insufficient to justify bad acts committed on the way to that goal, even if the bad acts are relatively minor and the goal is major (like telling a small lie to prevent a war and save millions of lives). In requiring all constituent acts to be good, deontological ethics is much more rigid than consequentialism, which varies by circumstances.\n\nPractical ethics are usually a mix of the two. For example, Mill also relies on deontic maxims to guide practical behavior, but they must be justifiable by the principle of utility.\n\nIn modern science, explanations that rely on teleology are often, but not always, avoided, either because they are unnecessary or because whether they are true or false is thought to be beyond the ability of human perception and understanding to judge. But using teleology as an explanatory style, in particular within evolutionary biology, is still controversial.\n\nApparent teleology is a recurring issue in evolutionary biology, much to the consternation of some writers.\n\nStatements which imply that nature has goals, for example where a species is said to do something \"in order to\" achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid. Usually, it is possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology even if that is not the intention. These issues have recently been discussed by John Reiss. He argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of such teleology by rejecting the analogy of natural selection as a watchmaker; other arguments against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as Richard Dawkins.\n\nSome authors, like James Lennox, have argued that Darwin was a teleologist, while others like Michael Ghiselin described this claim as a myth promoted by misinterpretations of his discussions and emphasized the distinction between using teleological metaphors and being teleological.\n\nBiologist philosopher Francisco Ayala has argued that all statements about processes can be trivially translated into teleological statements, and vice versa, but that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of. Karen Neander has argued that the modern concept of biological 'function' is dependent upon selection. So, for example, it is not possible to say that anything that simply winks into existence without going through a process of selection has functions. We decide whether an appendage has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection and function cannot be defined in the manner advocated by Reiss and Dawkins. Ernst Mayr states that \"adaptedness... is an \"a posteriori\" result rather than an \"a priori\" goal-seeking.\" Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of shorthand. For example, S. H. P. Madrell writes that \"the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements\" for the sake of saving space, but that this \"should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection.\" J. B. S. Haldane said, \"Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public.\"\n\nSelected-effects accounts, like the one Neander suggests, face objections due to their reliance on etiological accounts, which some fields lack the resources to accommodate. Many such sciences, which study the same traits and behaviors regarded by evolutionary biology, still correctly attribute teleological functions without appeal to selection history. Gualtiero Piccinini and Corey J. Maley are a proponent of one such account which focuses instead on goal-contribution. With the objective goals of organisms being survival and inclusive fitness, Piccinini and Maley define teleological functions to be “a stable contribution by a trait (or component, activity, property) of organisms belonging to a biological population to an objective goal of those organisms.” \n\nJulian Bigelow, Arturo Rosenblueth, and Norbert Wiener have conceived of feedback mechanisms as lending a teleology to machinery. Wiener, a mathematician, coined the term 'cybernetics' to denote the study of \"teleological mechanisms.\" Cybernetics is the study of the communication and control of regulatory feedback both in living beings and machines, and in combinations of the two. In the cybernetic classification presented in \"Behavior, Purpose and Teleology\", teleology is feedback controlled purpose.\n\nThe classification system underlying cybernetics was criticized by Frank Honywill George, who cited the need for an external observability to the purposeful behavior in order to establish and validate the goal-seeking behavior. In this view, the purpose of observing and observed systems is respectively distinguished by the system's subjective autonomy and objective control.\n\n"}

The WHS 4\" pointing trowel is well known as a standard excavation implement in British archaeology. \n\nThe founder of the company, William Hunt, was an edge tool maker at Rowley Regis, near Dudley, Worcestershire, in the late 18th century. In 1782 he purchased the Brades Estate at Oldbury, near Birmingham, and established a new works there known as Brades Forge, or simply as The Brades. By 1805 they were also manufacturing steel on the site, which was now known as the Brades Steel Works. Around 1793, Hunt took W. Cliffe into partnership, and for a short period the firm was known as Hunt and Cliffe: this name appears in the company's first ledger, dated 9 May 1794. This partnership dissolved around 1803, and Hunt continued trading on his own account until 1809, when he took his sons into partnership and the firm became known as William Hunt & Sons. \n\nIn 1828 the company acquired William Edwards and Sons (incorporating the Eagle Edge Tool Company), and later the business of Bache Bros, spade makers of Churchill Forge, near Stourbridge. In the late 19th century George Heaton became a major shareholder in the company.\n\nIn 1951 the company amalgamated with Nash Tyzack to form Brades Nash Tyzack Industries, and later took over the business of Skelton. In 1962, together with Harrison, they became part of Spear & Jackson, who in 1967 also acquired Edward Elwell Ltd, all the companies coming together as parts of S&J by 1972. In 1985 S&J became part of the Neill Tools Group based in Sheffield, who still own the brand today. \n\nThe company's major UK trade marks were BRADES and WHS, but they had many others, some of which, such as Eagle, Giraffe and Pagoda, were only used on tools made for export.\n\nThe WHS pointing trowel is prized amongst archaeologists in the United Kingdom who find its strength useful in digging heavy deposits. In his 1946 book \"Field Archaeology\", Richard J. C. Atkinson (best known for excavating Stonehenge), \"unequivocally\" recommended the use of a trowel for archaeology; during the postwar era, WHS and a competing brand from Bowden were predominant. By 1960, archaeologist Paul Stamper was told that a WHS trowel was a \"prerequisite\", and by 1999, he deemed it the \"industry standard\". \"Current Archaeology\" summed up the choices:\nIn 2005, the company introduced a new version of its 4\" WHS pointing trowel. The thinner and more brittle design was designed for the construction industry, and encountered resistance from archaeologists who found it inferior to its predecessor model. Oxford Archaeology indicated it might switch to the American-made Marshalltown trowel; and British Archaeological Jobs Resource received complaints of breakages on site. In response, in the summer of 2006, the firm launched a new trowel, marked \"Archaeologists' Trowel\" on the blade, the design of which took account of archaeologists' concerns and the results of field trials. It incorporated a thicker, stronger blade, higher lift for extra knuckle clearance, and a flattened tang to prevent handle rotation.\n\n"}
{"id": "34454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34454", "title": "Zosimus", "text": "Zosimus\n\nZosimus ( ; also known by the Latin name Zosimus Historicus, i.e. \"Zosimus the Historian\"; fl. 490s–510s) was a Greek historian who lived in Constantinople during the reign of the Eastern Roman Emperor Anastasius I (491–518). According to Photius, he was a \"comes\", and held the office of \"advocate\" of the imperial treasury. Zosimus was also known for condemning Constantine’s rejection of the pagan gods.\n\nZosimus' \"Historia Nova\" (Ἱστορία Νέα, \"New History\") is written in Greek in six books. For the period from 238 to 270, he apparently uses Dexippus; for the period from 270 to 404, Eunapius; and after 407, Olympiodorus. His dependence upon his sources is made clear by the change in tone and style between the Eunapian and Olympiodoran sections, and by the gap left in between them. In the Eunapian section, for example, he is pessimistic and critical of Stilicho; in the Olympiodoran section, he offers precise figures and transliterations from the Latin, and favors Stilicho.\n\nThe first book sketches briefly the history of the early Roman emperors from Augustus to Diocletian (305); the second, third and fourth deal more fully with the period from the accession of Constantius Chlorus and Galerius to the death of Theodosius I; the fifth and sixth, the most useful for historians, cover the period between 395 and 410, when Priscus Attalus was deposed; for this period, he is the most important surviving non-ecclesiastical source. The work, which breaks off abruptly in the summer of 410 at the beginning of the sixth book, is believed to have been written in 498–518.\n\nThe style is characterized by Photius as concise, clear and pure; other historians have judged his accounts confused or muddled, and valuable only because he preserves information from lost histories. The historian's object was to account for the decline of the Roman Empire from the polytheistic point of view. Zosimus is the only non-Christian source for much of what he reports.\n\nIn contrast to Polybius, who had narrated the rise of the Roman Empire, Zosimus documented the events and causes which led to its decline. Though the decline of the Roman Empire was Zosimus' primary subject, he also discussed events connected with Persian, and Greek history, perhaps in imitation of Polybius. It is clear that Photius and Evagrius did not have any more of Zosimus' work than what survives today. Yet it is likely that either a part of the work has been lost or, more likely, that Zosimus did not live to finish it; for it does not cover all the areas that Zosimus himself tells us he intended to discuss. There does not seem much probability in the conjecture that the monks and other ecclesiastics succeeded in suppressing that portion of the work in which the evil influences of their body were to be more especially touched upon. If the work was thus left incomplete, that circumstance would account for some carelessness of style which is here and there apparent. There may appear some difficulty at first sight, however, in the statement of Photius, that the work, in the form in which he saw it, appeared to him to be a second edition. But it would seem that Photius was under some misapprehension. It is called in the manuscripts \"Historia Nova\" (in what sense is not quite clear). This may perhaps have misled Photius. He himself remarks that he had not seen the first edition.\n\nZosimus was a polytheist, and is by no means sparing of the faults and crimes of the Christian emperors. In consequence of this his credibility has been fiercely assailed by several Christian writers, and has been sometimes defended merely because his history tended to the discredit of many leading persons in the Christian party. The question does not, as has sometimes been supposed, turn upon the credibility of the historians whom Zosimus followed, for he did not adhere in all cases to their judgment with respect to events and characters. For instance, although Zosimus followed Eunapius for the period 270–404, he entirely differed from Eunapius in his account of Stilicho and Serena. Of modern writers, Baronius, Lelio Bisciola, C. v. Barth, J. D. Ritter, Richard Bentley, and G. E. M. de Ste. Croix, have taken the derogatory side. Bentley in particular speaks of Zosimus with great contempt. On the other hand, his historical authority has been maintained by Leunclavius, G. B. von Schirach, J. Matth. Schrockh, and Reitemeier.\n\nThe history of Zosimus was first printed in the Latin translation of Leunclavius, accompanied by a defence of the historian (Basel, 1576, fol.). The first two books, in Greek, with the translation of Leunclavius, were printed by H. Stephanus, in his edition of Herodian (Paris, 1581). The first complete edition of the Greek text of Zosimus was that by F. Sylburg (\"Scriptores Hist. Rom. Min.\", vol. iii., Frankfurt, 1590). Later editions are those published at Oxford (1679), at Zeitz and Jena, edited by Cellarius, with annotations of his own and others (1679, 1713, 1729). The next edition is that by Reitemeier, who, though he consulted no fresh manuscripts, made good use of the critical remarks of Heyne and other scholars (Leipzig, 1784). Bekker produced a reliable edition in 1837 at Bonn. There is a German translation by Seybold and Heyler, and also an English and a French translation. (Schöll, Gesch. d. Griech. Lit. vol. iii, p. 232 ; Fabric. Bibl. Graec. vol. viii. p. 62.)\n\nThe single good manuscript, in the Vatican Library (MS Vat. Gr. 156), was unavailable to scholars until the mid-19th century. Ludwig Mendelssohn (Leipzig 1887) edited the first dependable text. The modern standard edition is F. Paschoud \"Zosime: Histoire Nouvelle\" (Paris 1971) which has a French translation, introduction and commentary. A later edition in English, \"Zosimus: New History\" a translation with commentary by Ronald T. Ridley, was published in 1982 by the Australian Association of Byzantine Studies.\n\n"}

She is also an expert in fragrance.\n\nÉlisabeth de Feydeau de Saint-Christophe, born Mabille de Poncheville, is the granddaughter of André Mabille de Poncheville, a French poet and writer, and the great-granddaughter of Georges Vidor, a shipowner. Of this family legacy, she developed from an early age a taste for writing, history, and French culture.\n\nAt sixteen, she discovered the emotional power of fragrance when she first smelt \"L'heure bleue\" by Guerlain, which she instant fell in love with. Ever since, she has felt intensely for the world of fragrances, which for her echoed the world of music, and the piano pieces she had studied when she was a child.\n\nAfter a Doctorate in history, she became a member of the Commission responsible for Cultural Affairs at the fashion firms Chanel and Bourjois. She established and managed the departments there, acquiring her first basic knowledge of the raw materials for fragrance.\n\nAfter this experience, she decided, in 1997, to found her own firm, \"Arty Fragrance\", where she started working as a consultant for olfactory and cultural development. She moved on to work for prestigious names in the world of fragrance-making: among others, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Chanel, Christian Dior Perfume, L'Oréal Paris, and also Guerlain.\n\nShe continued her fundamental research work fragrance and wrote books about it: \"Jean-Louis Fargeon, perfumer of Marie-Antoinette\" (2005), \"L'Herbier de Marie-Antoinette\" (2012), \"Les Parfums, histoire, dictionnaire, anthologie\" (2011), \"Les 101 mots du parfums\" (2013)...\n\nToday a well-known expert on perfume, she has been acknowledged as such by famous, high-profile perfume companies. Since 1998, she has been teaching at the \"School of Fragrances\", in Versailles.\n\nShe has put up several exhibitions, such as \"Parfums de Promenade\", in the \"Galerie des Galeries\" (Galeries Lafayette, 2001) and at \"La Cour des Senteurs de Versailles\" (2013). She has also animated workshops and conferences all around the world, particularly in Francophone countries.\n\nIn 2011, she introduced the brand \"Arty Fragrance by Elisabeth de Feydeau\", where she created and commercialized a more confidential line of perfumes, all inspired by the luxury and sophistication of the French 17th and 18th centuries, such as they could be felt, more than anywhere else, at the Château de Versailles: she has often wandered around in the Park of Versailles, while doing research work for her books. In 2006, she was chosen by the rose-breeder Meilland to be godmother to the new rose called \"Petit Trianon\", along with another perfume-maker, Francis Kurkdjian, with whom she had just recreated the fragrance of French queen Marie-Antoinette: \"Le Sillage de la Reine\".\n\nSince 2008, she has been holding a blog where she regularly publishes articles about perfumes, perfume-makers - and, in a more general way, about the world of perfumes.\n\n\n"}
