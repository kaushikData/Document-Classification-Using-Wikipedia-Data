{"id": "42034541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42034541", "title": "Caryl Churchill", "text": "Caryl Churchill\n\nCaryl Churchill (born 3 September 1938, London) is a British playwright known for dramatising the abuses of power, for her use of non-naturalistic techniques, and for her exploration of sexual politics and feminist themes.\n\nHer early work developed Bertolt Brecht's modernist dramatic and theatrical techniques of Epic theatre to explore issues of gender and sexuality. From \"A Mouthful of Birds\" (1986) onwards, she began to experiment with forms of dance-theatre, incorporating techniques developed from the performance tradition initiated by Antonin Artaud with his 'Theatre of Cruelty'. This move away from a clear \"Fabel\" dramaturgy towards increasingly fragmented and surrealistic narratives characterises her work as postmodernist.\n\nChurchill was born in London, England, the daughter of Jan Brown, a fashion model, and Robert Churchill, a political cartoonist. After World War II, her family emigrated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Churchill was ten years old. In Montreal, she attended Trafalgar School for Girls.\n\nShe returned to England to attend university, and in 1960 she graduated from Lady Margaret Hall, a women's college at Oxford University, with a B.A. degree in English Literature. She also began her writing career there. Her four earliest plays, \"Downstairs\" (produced 1958),\"You've No Need to be Frightened\", \"Having a Wonderful Time\" (1960), and \"Easy Death\" (produced 1962) were performed at Oxford by student theatre ensembles.\n\nIn 1961 she married David Harter, a barrister. They have three sons and live in Islington, North London.\n\nIt was while raising a family in the 1960s and '70s that Churchill began to write short radio dramas for BBC radio. These included \"The Ants\" (1962), \"Not, Not, Not, Not Enough Oxygen\" (1971), and \"Schreber's Nervous Illness\" (1972). She also wrote television plays for the BBC, including \"The After Dinner Joke\" (1978) and \"Crimes\" (1982). These, as well as some of her radio plays, have been adapted for the stage.\n\nIn 1972, she wrote \"Owners\", a two-act, 14-scene play about obsession with power. It was her first stage play and \"her first major theatrical endeavour\"; it was produced in London the same year. Churchill's socialist views are expressed in the play, a critique of the values that most capitalists take for granted: being aggressive, getting ahead, doing well.\n\nShe served as resident dramatist at the Royal Court Theatre from 1974 to 1975, and later began collaboration with theatre companies such as Joint Stock Theatre Company and Monstrous Regiment (a feminist theatre collective). Both used an extended workshop period in their development of new plays. Churchill continues to use an improvisational workshop period in developing a number of her plays. During this period, she also wrote \"Objections to Sex and Violence\" (1974).\n\nHer first play to receive wide notice was \"Cloud Nine\" (1979), \"a farce about sexual politics\", set partly in a British overseas colony during the Victorian era. It explores the effects of the colonialist/imperialist mindset on intimate personal relationships, and uses cross-gender casting for comic and instructive effect. The play became successful in Britain and in the United States, winning an Obie Award in 1982 for best play of the year in New York.\n\nChurchill gradually abandoned more conventions of realism, and her loyalty to feminist themes and ideas became a guiding principle in her work. She won an Obie Award for best play with \"Top Girls\" (1982), \"which deals with women's losing their humanity in order to attain power in a male-dominated environment.\" It features an all-female cast, and focuses on Marlene, who has relinquished a home and family to achieve success in the world of business. Half the action takes place at a celebratory dinner where Marlene mixes with historical, iconic and fictional women who have achieved great stature in a \"man's world\", but always at great cost. The other half of the play, set a year in the past, focuses on Marlene's family, where the true cost of her \"successful\" life becomes poignantly and frighteningly apparent.\n\n\"Softcops\" (first produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1984), is a \"surreal play set in 19th-century France about government attempts to depoliticize illegal acts.\"\n\n\"Serious Money\" (1987), \"a comedy about excesses in the financial world\", is a verse play, chiefly written in rhyming couplets. It takes a satirical look at the vagaries of the stock market and its Thatcherite denizens. The play was highly acclaimed, perhaps in part because it played immediately after the stock market crash of 1987. \"Icecream\" (Royal Court Theatre 1989) explores Anglo-American stereotypes.\n\nIn \"The Skriker\" (1994), Churchill's play, a visionary exploration of global ecology made through gender games, storytelling, distorted language and evocations of modern urban life, follows an ancient and shape-shifting death portent (\"The Skriker\") in her search for love, revenge and human understanding.\n\n\"The prolific Churchill continued to push boundaries into the late 1990s. In 1997 she collaborated with the composer Orlando Gough to create 'Hotel,' a choreographed opera or sung ballet set in a hotel room. Also that year her surrealistic short play 'This Is a Chair' was produced.\"\n\nHer 2002 play, \"A Number\", addresses the subject of human cloning and questions of identity. Her adapted screenplay of \"A Number\" was shown on BBC TV in September 2008. Her recent play, \"Drunk Enough To Say I Love You\" (2006), takes a critical look at what she sees as Britain's submission to the United States in foreign policy.\n\nIn 2010, Churchill was commissioned to write the libretto for a new short opera by Orlando Gough, as part of the Royal Opera House's ROH2 OperaShots initiative. The resulting work, \"A ring a lamp a thing\", played for five performances in the Linbury Studio Theatre at the Royal Opera House.\n\nHer \"Love and Information\", opened at the Royal Court Theatre in September 2012, directed by James Macdonald. It gained great critical and popular acclaim. The play, featuring 100 characters and performed by a cast of 15, is structured as a series of more than 50 fragmented scenes, some no longer than 25 seconds, all of which are apparently unrelated but which accumulate into a startling mosaic, a portrayal of modern consciousness and the need for human intimacy, love and connection. The play will have its regional premiere at Sheffield Theatres in June 2018, directed by Caroline Steinbeis.\n\nChurchill has published a translation of Seneca's \"Thyestes\" and her version of August Strindberg's \"A Dream Play\". The latter was premiered at the National Theatre in 2005.\n\nThe Royal Court Theatre held a 70th Birthday retrospective of her work by presenting readings of many of her most famous plays directed by notable playwrights, including Martin Crimp and Mark Ravenhill.\nOf course it's possible to trace recurring themes in Churchill's work – alienation between parent and child, the possibility and failure of revolution. But it is the variety of her work that is most striking. As Von Mayenburg says: \"With each play, she discovers new genres and forms. She then discards them and moves on, opening up possibilities for other playwrights to explore. I think many people writing today don't even realise they've been influenced by her. She's changed the language of theatre. And very few playwrights do that.\"\n\nChurchill is a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. \n\nIn January 2009, she wrote a ten-minute play that explores a history of Israel, ending with the 2008 Israeli attack on Gaza. It was performed for free at the Royal Court Theatre, with a collection taken to donate to Medical Aid for Palestinians.\n\n\"The Sunday Times\" condemned its \"ludicrous and utterly predictable lack of even-handedness\"; but for \"The Times\", \"there are no heroes or villains, for all that Churchill decries what is happening in Gaza\". Writers such as Jeffrey Goldberg of \"The Atlantic\" and Melanie Phillips in her \"Spectator\" blog criticised the play as anti-Semitic, as did John Nathan. He noted that\nChurchill has said that \"Seven Jewish Children\" is \"not just a theatre event but a political event.\" He suggested that a play representing views of one community and critical of that community needed to be written by a member of that community. The Royal Court denied the accusation.\n\nChurchill published the play, \"Seven Jewish Children – a play about Gaza\", online, for free download and use. Churchill said: \"Anyone can perform it without acquiring the rights, as long as they do a collection for people in Gaza at the end of it\".\n\nChurchill has received the following awards:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His courtesy name was Shangyou (). During his childhood, his family moved to Jimei, in modern-day Xiamen, likely to facilitate young Chen's enrollment at the Jimei Normal School. In 1925, Chen enrolled at Shanghai Labor University, and in 1927 he joined the Communist Party of China. After returning to Fujian, he was hired as the personal secretary of General Zhang Zhen, helping to prepare for the 1926–1927 Northern Expedition from the CCP side of the First United Front. When the Front collapsed, Chen fled and was eventually arrested in Nanjing. He was released after a month on General Zhang's recommendation. Shortly thereafter, Chen was selected to study at Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow for four years.\n\nIn 1931, Chen Boda returned to China, and married Sichuan native Zhu Yuren, who had also studied in Moscow. Chen began teaching ancient Chinese history in Beijing while writing articles under the pen names Chen Zhimei and Chen Boda. Most of these articles focused on the dispute between advocates of \"national defense literature\" such as Lu Xun, and more nationalist authors. Chen also did underground work for the Party in Tianjin. From 1937 on, he lectured at the Central Party School in Yan'an, where he became a leader in the Yan'an Rectification Movement. He soon became personal research assistant and secretary to Mao Zedong. Chen published the first collection of Mao's writings in 1937, and an official history of the Party in 1945.\n\nIn 1951, he wrote an article with the title \"Mao Zedong's theory of the Chinese Revolution is the combination of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese Revolution\" and a book entitled \"Mao Zedong on the Chinese Revolution\". These works made him one of the most important interpreters of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the 1950s he became Mao's personal secretary and close associate, and compiled many of the quotations published in Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung. In 1958, he became the editor of the party journal \"Red Flag\".\n\nFrom 1966 until 1969, Chen Boda was to play an important role in the Cultural Revolution. In May 1966, he was placed at the head of the newly formed Cultural Revolution Group (CRG), a body established to oversee and direct the course of the Cultural Revolution. In time, this group would rise to become the most important political body in China, surpassing even the influence of the Politburo. Furthermore, Chen Boda was also placed as head of the Communist government's propaganda apparatus alongside Jiang Qing when the previous leader, Lu Dingyi, was deposed in 1966. He also became a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution Group began to show signs of ultra-leftism according to the Central Committee leadership, and Boda's reputation began to wane after the 9th Party Congress in 1969. This marked the end of Chen Boda's involvement in the Cultural Revolution. As the leadership became more moderate in its outlook and the initial aims of the Cultural Revolution were sidelined, Chen's radicalism caused concern, and he was denounced at the 10th Party Congress in 1973 as a 'revisionist secret agent' for his associations with Lin Biao.\n\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, he was tried by the post-Mao government for collaboration with the Gang of Four. He was sentenced to eighteen years in prison, but was released shortly afterwards due to his ill health. He died on 20 September 1989.\n"}

{"id": "47611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47611", "title": "Doomsday Clock", "text": "Doomsday Clock\n\nThe Doomsday Clock is a symbol which represents the likelihood of a man-made global catastrophe. Maintained since 1947 by the members of the \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" Science and Security Board, the clock represents an analogy for the threat of global nuclear war. Since 2007, it has also reflected climate change and new developments in the life sciences and technology that could inflict irrevocable harm to humanity.\n\nThe clock represents the hypothetical global catastrophe as \"midnight\" and \"The Bulletin\"s opinion on how close the world is to a global catastrophe as a number of \"minutes\" to midnight. Its original setting in 1947 was seven minutes to midnight. It has been set backward and forward 23 times since then, the smallest-ever number of minutes to midnight being two (in 1953 and 2018) and the largest seventeen (in 1991). , the clock is set at two minutes to midnight, due to \"the looming threats of nuclear war and climate change.”\n\nThe Doomsday Clock's origin can be traced to the international group of researchers called the Chicago Atomic Scientists, who had participated in the Manhattan Project. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they began publishing a mimeographed newsletter and then the magazine, \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\", which, since its inception, has depicted the clock on every cover. The clock was first represented in 1947, when \"The Bulletin\" co-founder Hyman Goldsmith asked artist Martyl Langsdorf (wife of Manhattan Project research associate and Szilárd petition signatory Alexander Langsdorf, Jr.) to design a cover for the magazine's June 1947 issue. As Eugene Rabinowitch, another co-founder of \"The Bulletin\", explained later, Langsdorf chose a clock to reflect the urgency of the problem: like a countdown, the clock suggests that destruction will naturally occur unless someone takes action to stop it.\n\nIn January 2007, designer Michael Bierut, who was on \"The Bulletin\"s Governing Board, redesigned the clock to give it a more modern feel. In 2009, \"The Bulletin\" ceased its print edition and became one of the first print publications in the U.S. to become entirely digital; the clock is now found as part of the logo on \"The Bulletin\"'s website. Information about the Doomsday Clock Symposium, a timeline of the clock's settings, and multimedia shows about the clock's history and culture can also be found on \"The Bulletin\"s website.\n\nThe 5th Doomsday Clock Symposium was held on November 14, 2013, in Washington, D.C.; it was a day-long event that was open to the public and featured panelists discussing various issues on the topic \"Communicating Catastrophe\". There was also an evening event at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in conjunction with the Hirshhorn's current exhibit, \"Damage Control: Art and Destruction Since 1950\". The panel discussions, held at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, were streamed live from \"The Bulletin\"s website and can still be viewed there. Reflecting international events dangerous to humankind, the clock has been adjusted 22 times since its inception in 1947, when it was set to \"seven minutes to midnight\".\n\n\"Midnight\" has a deeper meaning to it besides the constant threat of war. There are various things taken into consideration when the scientists from The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists decide what Midnight and Global catastrophe really mean in a particular year. They might include \"Politics, Energy, Weapons, Diplomacy, and Climate science.\" Potential sources of threat included nuclear threats, climate change, bioterrorism, and artificial intelligence. Members of the board judge Midnight by discussing how close they think humanity is to the end of civilization. In 1947, during the Cold War, the clock was started at seven minutes to midnight. The clock's setting is decided without a specified starting time. The clock is not set and reset in real time as events occur; rather than respond to each and every crisis as it happens, the Science and Security Board meets twice annually to discuss global events in a deliberative manner. The closest nuclear war threat, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, reached crisis, climax, and resolution before the clock could be set to reflect that possible doomsday.\n\nThe two tied-for-lowest points for the Doomsday Clock have been in 1953, when the clock was set to two minutes until midnight after the U.S. and the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs, and in 2018, following the failure of world leaders to address tensions relating to nuclear weapons and climate change issues. In other years, the clock’s time has fluctuated from 17 minutes in 1991 to 2 minutes 30 seconds in 2017. Discussing the change to 2½ minutes in 2017, the first use of a fraction in the clock's history, Krauss, one of the scientists from the Bulletin, warned that our political leaders must make decisions based on facts, and those facts \"must be taken into account if the future of humanity is to be preserved.\" In an announcement from the Bulletin about the status of the clock, they went as far to call for action from “wise” public officials and “wise” citizens to make an attempt to steer human life away from catastrophe while we still can. In January 2018, the clock was lowered further to 2 minutes to midnight, meaning that the clock's status today is tied for closest to midnight since the clock’s start in 1947.\n\nThe Doomsday Clock has become a universally recognized metaphor. According to the \"Bulletin\", the clock attracts more daily visitors to the Bulletin's site than any other feature.\n\nAnders Sandberg of the Future of Humanity Institute has stated that the \"grab bag of threats\" currently mixed together by the clock can induce paralysis. People may be more likely to succeed at smaller, incremental challenges; for example, taking steps to prevent the accidental detonation of nuclear weapons was a small but significant step in avoiding nuclear war. Alex Barasch in \"Slate\" argues that \"Putting humanity on a permanent, blanket high-alert isn't helpful when it comes to policy or science\", and criticizes the \"Bulletin\" for neither explaining nor attempting to quantify their methodology.\n\nConservative media often clash against the \"Bulletin\". Keith Payne writes in the \"National Review\" that the clock overestimates the effects of \"developments in the areas of nuclear testing and formal arms control\". Tristin Hopper in the \"National Post\" acknowledges that \"there are plenty of things to worry about regarding climate change\", but states that climate change isn't in the same league as total nuclear destruction. In addition, some critics accuse the \"Bulletin\" of pushing a political agenda.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "726304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=726304", "title": "Fusang", "text": "Fusang\n\nFusang () refers to several different entities in ancient Chinese literature, often either a mythological tree or a mysterious land to the East.\n\nIn the \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\" and several contemporary texts, the term refers to a mythological tree of life, alternately identified as a mulberry or hibiscus, allegedly growing far to the east of China, and perhaps to various more concrete territories east of the mainland.\n\nA country named Fusang was described by the native Buddhist missionary Hui Shen () in 499 AD, as a place 20,000 Chinese \"li\" east of Da-han, and also east of China (according to Joseph Needham, Da-han corresponds to the Buriat region of Siberia). Hui Shen went by ship to Fusang, and upon his return reported his findings to the Chinese Emperor. His descriptions are recorded in the 7th-century text \"Book of Liang\" by Yao Silian, and describe a Bronze Age civilization inhabiting the Fusang country. The Fusang described by Shen has been variously posited to be the Americas, Sakhalin island, the Kamchatka Peninsula or the Kuril Islands. The American hypothesis was the most hotly debated one in the late 19th and early 20th century after the 18th-century writings of Joseph de Guignes were revived and disseminated by Charles Godfrey Leland in 1875. Sinologists including Emil Bretschneider, Berthold Laufer, and Henri Cordier refuted this hypothesis however, and according to Needham the American hypothesis was all but refuted by the time of the First World War.\n\nLater Chinese accounts used the name Fusang for other, even less well identified places.\n\nAn earlier account claims that in 219 BC, emperor Shi Huang sent an expedition of some 3,000 convicts to a place lying far off to the east, across the ocean, called Fusang, to be a sacrifice to a volcano god who held the elixir of life. There were, apparently, two expeditions under Xu Fu, the court sorcerer, to seek the elixir of life. The first expedition returned c. 210 BC when Xufu claimed a giant sea creature was blocking their path. Archers were then sent to deal with this monster when the expedition set out a second time, but it was never heard from again. However, \"... asides in the \"Record of the Historian\" imply that its leader Xu Fu had returned to China long ago and was lurking somewhere near Langya, frittering away the expedition's impressive budget.\"\n\nJapan was one interpretation of the term \"Fusang\". However, Hui Shen's report differentiates Fusang from the ancient Japanese kingdom of Wo, which has been tentatively located in Kinki, Kyūshū, or the Ryukyu Islands.\n\nIn Chinese mythology, Fusang refers to a divine tree and island in the East, from where the sun rises. A similar tree, known as Ruomu (若木) exists in the west, and each morning the sun was said to rise from Fusang and fall on Ruomu. Chinese legend has ten birds (typically ravens) living in the tree, and as nine rested, the tenth would carry the sun on its journey. This legend has similarities with the Chinese tale of the fictional hero Houyi, sometimes referred to as the Archer, who is credited with saving the world by shooting down nine of the suns when one day all ten took to the air simultaneously. Some scholars have identified the bronze trees found at the archaeological site Sanxingdui with these Fusang trees.\n\nThe term Fusang would later designate 'Japan' in Chinese poetry. Since Japanese \"Nihon\" (日本, lit. 'Root [\"i.e.\" source, birthplace, origin] of the Sun') or Chinese \"Riben\" was a name of Japan, some Tang dynasty poets believed Fusang \"lay between the mainland and Japan.\" For instance, Wang Wei wrote a 753 farewell poem when Abe no Nakamaro (Chinese Zhao Heng 晁衡) returned to Japan, \"The trees of your home are beyond Fu-sang.\"\n\nFusang is pronounced \"Fusō\" (ふそう　扶桑, from classical \"Fusau\" ふさう) in the Japanese language, and is one of the names to designate ancient Japan. Several warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy were named \"Fusō\" (the ironclad \"Fusō\", or the World War II battleship \"Fusō\"). Several companies, such as Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, also bear the name.\n\nGustaaf Schlegel thought Fusang was most probably \"the long island of Karafuto or Sakhalin\". Joseph Needham added that \"if Kamchatka and the Kuriles may also be considered there is no better means of identifying it at the present day.\"\n\nNote that there was an ancient province of Japan called \"Fusa-no kuni\" ('Country of Fusa') in eastern Honshū, encompassing all of modern Chiba Prefecture as well as the southwestern part of modern Ibaraki Prefecture.\n\nAccording to some historians such as Charles Godfrey Leland and Joseph de Guignes (\"Le Fou-Sang des Chinois est-il l'Amérique?\" Mémoires de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, tome 28, Paris, 1761), the distances given by Hui Shen (20,000 Chinese \"li\") would locate Fusang on the west coast of the American continent, when taking the ancient Han-period definition of the Chinese \"li\". Some 18th-century European maps locate Fusang north of California, in the area of British Columbia. An American location does not match the claim for horses (which did not exist in North or South America at that time) or the domestication and milking of deer.\n\nAccording to the report of Hui Shen to the Chinese during his visit to China, described in the \"Liang Shu\":\n\nOn the organization of the country:\n\nOn the social practices:\n\nThe Liang Shu also describes the conversion of Fusang to the Buddhist faith by five Buddhist monks from Gandhara:\n\n\n\n"}

He is the first known Briton of African heritage to vote in a British election. He gained fame in his time as \"the extraordinary Negro\", and to eighteenth-century British abolitionists he became a symbol of the humanity of Africans and immorality of the slave trade. \"The Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho, an African\", edited and published two years after his death, is one of the earliest accounts of African slavery written in English by a former slave of Spanish and English families.\n\nIgnatius Sancho was born on a slave ship in 1729; his precise birthplace is thus unknown. After his mother died in the Spanish colony of New Granada and his father killed himself rather than live as a slave, Sancho was taken to England. From 1731 to 1749, he worked for three maiden sisters in Greenwich. John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu (of the first creation) (1690–1749), impressed by Sancho's intellect, frankness, and his amiability, not only encouraged him to read, but also lent him books from his personal library at Blackheath. Sancho's informal education made his lack of freedom in Greenwich unbearable, and he ran away to the Montagus in 1749. For two years until her death in 1751, Sancho worked as the butler for Mary Montagu (née Churchill), Duchess of Montagu, at Montagu House, where he flourished by immersing himself in music, poetry, reading, and writing. At her death in 1751 he received an annuity of £30 and a year's salary, which he quickly squandered.\n\nDuring the 1760s Sancho married a West Indian woman, Ann Osborne. He became a devoted husband and father. They had seven children: Frances Joanna (1761–1815), Ann Alice (1763–1805), Elizabeth Bruce (1766–1837), Jonathan William (1768–1770), Lydia (1771–1776), Katherine Margaret (1773–1779), and William Leach Osborne (1775–1810). Around the time of the birth of their third child, Sancho became a valet to the George Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu (of the second creation), son-in-law of his earlier patron. He remained there until 1773.\n\nIn 1768 Thomas Gainsborough painted a portrait of Sancho at the same time as the Duchess of Montagu sat for her portrait by the artist. By the late 1760s Sancho had already become accomplished and was considered by many to be a man of refinement.\n\nIn 1766, at the height of the debate about slavery, Sancho wrote to Laurence Sterne encouraging the famous writer to use his pen to lobby for the abolition of the slave trade.\n\nIn July 1766 Sancho's letter was received by Reverend Laurence Sterne shortly after he had just finished writing a conversation between his fictional characters, Corporal Trim and his brother Tom in \"Tristram Shandy\", wherein Tom described the oppression of an African servant in a sausage shop in Lisbon that he had visited. Laurence Sterne's widely publicised 27 July 1766 response to Sancho's letter became an integral part of 18th-century abolitionist literature.\n\nFollowing the publication of the Sancho-Sterne letters, Sancho became widely known as a man of letters.\n\nSancho, an African participant and voter in Westminster, noted that despite being in Britain since the age of two he felt he was \"only a lodger, and hardly that.\" In other writings he describes: \"Went by water - had a coach home - were gazed at - followed, etc. etc. - but not much abused.\" On another occasion, he writes: \"They stopped us in the town and most generously insulted us.\"\n\nIn 1774 with help from Montagu, Sancho, suffering from ill health with gout, opened a greengrocery shop, offering merchandise such as tobacco, sugar and tea, at 19 Charles Street in London's Mayfair, Westminster. These were goods then mostly produced by slaves.\n\nAs shopkeeper Sancho enjoyed more time to socialise, correspond with his many friends, share his enjoyment of literature, and he attracted many people to his shop. He wrote and published a \"Theory of Music\" and two plays. As a financially independent male householder living in Westminster, he qualified to vote in the parliamentary elections of 1774 and 1780; he was the first person of African origin known to have voted in Britain. At this time he also wrote letters and in newspapers, under his own name and under the pseudonym \"Africanus\". He supported the monarchy and British forces in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nAmong his acquaintances were celebrated figures such as Thomas Gainsborough, the Shakespearean actor David Garrick, violin virtuoso Felice Giardini, the preacher Dr. Dodd, the renowned sculptor Joseph Nollekens, and the novelist Laurence Sterne. Nollekin gave Sancho a plaster cast of his c. 1766 marble bust of Laurence Sterne (National Portrait Gallery, London). Sancho received many prominent visitors at his shop, including statesman and abolitionist Charles James Fox PC (1749–1806), who successfully steered a resolution through Parliament pledging it to abolish the slave trade. He oversaw a Foreign Slave Trade Bill in spring 1806 that prohibited British subjects from contributing to the trading of slaves with the colonies of Britain's wartime enemies, thus eliminating two-thirds of the slave trade passing through British ports.\n\nIgnatius Sancho died from the effects of gout on 14 December 1780. He was the first person of African descent known to be given an obituary in the British press.\n\nWhile his correspondence often included domestic issues, also commented on the political and literary life in 18th-century Britain, One of his more famous series of letters includes his eye-witness accounts of the Gordon Riots in June 1780. The angry mob passed outside his shop on Charles Street. The protest that began when Protestants protested against parliamentary extension of Catholic enfranchisement grew into a violent mob of 100, 000 looting and burning parts of London.\n\nIn 1782 Frances Crewe, a correspondent with Sancho, arranged for 160 of his letters to be published in the form of two-volumes entitled, \"The Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho, an African\". The book sold very well, with more than 2000 subscribing to it. His widow received more than £500 in royalties. Joseph Jekyll provided the memoirs to the first edition, which was reprinted with each additional edition including the fifth edition published by Sancho's son in 1803.\n\nHis son, William Leach Osborne, inherited the shop and transformed it into a printing and book-selling business. He printed a fifth edition of \"Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho with Memoirs of His Life by Joseph Jekyll\" and the frontispiece engraving by Bartolozzi, in 1803 at this shop on Charles Street.\n\nSancho was unusually blunt in his response to a letter from Jack Wingrave, John Wingrave's son. Jack wrote about his negative reaction to people of colour based on his own experience in India during the 1770s. Sancho's friend, John was a London bookbinder and bookseller.\n\nI am sorry to observe that the practice of your country (which as a resident I love – and for its freedom – and for the many blessings I enjoy in it – shall ever have my warmest wishes, prayers and blessings); I say it is with reluctance, that I must observe your country's conduct has been uniformly wicked in the East – West-Indies – and even on the coast of Guinea. The grand object of English navigators – indeed of all Christian navigators – is money – money – money – for which I do not pretend to blame them – Commerce was meant by the goodness of the Deity to diffuse the various goods of the earth into every part – to unite mankind in the blessed chains of brotherly love – society – and mutual dependence: the enlightened Christian should diffuse the riches of the Gospel of peace – with the commodities of his respective land – Commerce attended with strict honesty – and with Religion for its companion – would be a blessing to every shore it touched at. In Africa, the poor wretched natives blessed with the most fertile and luxuriant soil – are rendered so much the more miserable for what Providence meant as a blessing: the Christians' abominable traffic for slaves and the horrid cruelty and treachery of the petty Kings encouraged by their Christian customers who carry them strong liquors to enflame their national madness – and powder – and bad fire-arms – to furnish them with the hellish means of killing and kidnapping.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43591208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43591208", "title": "Instrumental convergence", "text": "Instrumental convergence\n\nInstrumental convergence is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently intelligent agents to pursue certain instrumental goals such as self-preservation and resource acquisition.\n\nInstrumental convergence suggests that an intelligent agent with apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example, a computer with the sole goal of solving the Riemann hypothesis could attempt to turn the entire Earth into computronium in an effort to increase its computing power so that it can succeed in its calculations.\n\nProposed basic AI drives include utility function or goal-content integrity, self-protection, freedom from interference, self-improvement, and non-satiable acquisition of additional resources.\n\nFinal goals, or final values, are intrinsically valuable to an intelligent agent, whether an artificial intelligence or a human being, as an end in itself. In contrast, instrumental goals, or instrumental values, are only valuable to an agent as a means toward accomplishing its final goals. The contents and tradeoffs of a completely rational agent's \"final goal\" system can be formalized into a utility function.\n\nOne hypothetical example of instrumental convergence is provided by the Riemann Hypothesis catastrophe. Marvin Minsky, the co-founder of MIT's AI laboratory, has suggested that an artificial intelligence designed to solve the Riemann hypothesis might decide to take over all of Earth's resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal. If the computer had instead been programmed to produce as many paper clips as possible, it would still decide to take all of Earth's resources to meet its final goal. Even though these two final goals are different, both of them produce a \"convergent\" instrumental goal of taking over Earth's resources.\n\nThe paperclip maximizer is a thought experiment described by Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom in 2003. It illustrates the existential risk that an artificial general intelligence may pose to human beings when programmed to pursue even seemingly-harmless goals, and the necessity of incorporating machine ethics into artificial intelligence design. The scenario describes an advanced artificial intelligence tasked with manufacturing paperclips. If such a machine were not programmed to value human life, then given enough power its optimized goal would be to turn all matter in the universe, including human beings, into either paperclips or machines which manufacture paperclips.\n\nBostrom has emphasised that he does not believe the paperclip maximiser scenario \"per se\" will actually occur; rather, his intention is to illustrate the dangers of creating superintelligent machines without knowing how to safely program them to eliminate existential risk to human beings. The paperclip maximizer example illustrates the broad problem of managing powerful systems that lack human values.\n\nSteve Omohundro has itemized several convergent instrumental goals, including self-preservation or self-protection, utility function or goal-content integrity, self-improvement, and resource acquisition. He refers to these as the \"basic AI drives\". A \"drive\" here denotes a \"tendency which will be present unless specifically counteracted\"; this is different from the psychological term \"drive\", denoting an excitatory state produced by a homeostatic disturbance. A tendency for a person to fill out income tax forms every year is a \"drive\" in Omohundro's sense, but not in the psychological sense. Daniel Dewey of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute argues that even an initially introverted self-rewarding AGI may continue to acquire free energy, space, time, and freedom from interference to ensure that it will not be stopped from self-rewarding.\n\nIn humans, maintenance of final goals can be explained with a thought experiment. Suppose a man named \"Gandhi\" has a pill that, if he took it, would cause him to want to kill people. This Gandhi is currently a pacifist: one of his explicit final goals is to never kill anyone. Gandhi is likely to refuse to take the pill, because Gandhi knows that if in the future he wants to kill people, he is likely to actually kill people, and thus the goal of \"not killing people\" would not be satisfied.\n\nHowever, in other cases, people seem happy to let their final values drift. Humans are complicated, and their goals can be inconsistent or unknown, even to themselves.\n\nIn 2009, Jürgen Schmidhuber concluded, in a setting where agents search for proofs about possible self-modifications, \"that any rewrites of the utility function can happen only if the Gödel machine first can prove that the rewrite is useful according to the present utility function.\" An analysis by Bill Hibbard of a different scenario is similarly consistent with maintenance of goal content integrity. Hibbard also argues that in a utility maximizing framework the only goal is maximizing expected utility, so that instrumental goals should be called unintended instrumental actions.\n\nMany instrumental goals, such as [...] resource acquisition, are valuable to an agent because they increase its \"freedom of action\".\n\nFor almost any open-ended, non-trivial reward function (or set of goals), possessing more resources (such as equipment, raw materials, or energy) can enable the AI to find a more \"optimal\" solution. Resources can benefit some AIs directly, through being able to create more of whatever stuff its reward function values: \"The AI neither hates you, nor loves you, but you are made out of atoms that it can use for something else.\" In addition, almost all AIs can benefit from having more resources to spend on other instrumental goals, such as self-preservation.\n\n\"If the agent's final goals are fairly unbounded and the agent is in a position to become the first superintelligence and thereby obtain a decisive strategic advantage, [...] according to its preferences. At least in this special case, a rational intelligent agent would place a very *high instrumental value on cognitive enhancement*\" \n\nMany instrumental goals, such as [...] technological advancement, are valuable to an agent because they increase its \"freedom of action\".\n\nMany instrumental goals, such as [...] self-preservation, are valuable to an agent because they increase its \"freedom of action\".\n\nThe instrumental convergence thesis, as outlined by philosopher Nick Bostrom, states:\n\nSeveral instrumental values can be identified which are convergent in the sense that their attainment would increase the chances of the agent's goal being realized for a wide range of final goals and a wide range of situations, implying that these instrumental values are likely to be pursued by a broad spectrum of situated intelligent agents.\n\nThe instrumental convergence thesis applies only to instrumental goals; intelligent agents may have a wide variety of possible final goals.\n\nAgents can acquire resources by trade or by conquest. A rational agent will, by definition, choose whatever option will maximize its implicit utility function; therefore a rational agent will trade for a subset of another agent's resources only if outright seizing the resources is too risky or costly (compared with the gains from taking all the resources), or if some other element in its utility function bars it from the seizure. In the case of a powerful, self-interested, rational superintelligence interacting with a lesser intelligence, peaceful trade (rather than unilateral seizure) seems unnecessary and suboptimal, and therefore unlikely.\n\nSome observers, such as Skype's Jaan Tallinn and physicist Max Tegmark, believe that \"basic AI drives\", and other unintended consequences of superintelligent AI programmed by well-meaning programmers, could pose a significant threat to human survival, especially if an \"intelligence explosion\" abruptly occurs due to recursive self-improvement. Since nobody knows how to predict beforehand when superintelligence will arrive, such observers call for research into friendly artificial intelligence as a possible way to mitigate existential risk from artificial general intelligence.\n\n\n"}

He was a Doctor of Historical Sciences and a Professor at Yerevan State University, where he headed the Faculty of Oriental Studies.\n\nKirakosyan was born in Yerevan, the capital of Soviet Armenia, in 1929. From 1955 till 1962, he contributed to the periodical of the Communist Party of Armenia, \"Leninyan Ughiov\". From 1962 till 1966 he was head of the propaganda division of the party's Central Committee, and from 1966 till 1969 he served as chairman of the state committee of the Armenian SSR on television and radiobroadcasting. From 1969 till 1975 he was head of the science and education division of the party, and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Armenian SSR from 1975 until his death in 1985.\n\nAmongst his scientific works are numerous research papers and several lengthy treatises that constitute a major contribution to the understanding of key aspects of Armenian history.\n\nIn 1954 Kirakosyan successfully defended his thesis at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the USSR Academy of Sciences, which was dedicated to the subject of British intervention in Iran in 1919-1921. In 1957 his work \"A heroic page in the national liberation struggle of the Indian people\" appeared in print, in which he focused on one of the most important events of India's national liberation struggle - the Sepoy Mutiny, which the Armenian community of India also took part in.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, Kirakosyan conducted in-depth research into the most complex and tragic events in the history of Western Armenia, uncovering little-known and poorly studied aspects of the Armenian Question. This would be a passion of his for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1965 Kirakosyan's major work \"The First World War and the Western Armenians\" was published. The book was published a total of three times (in 1965 and 1967 in Armenian, and in 1971 in Russian). In 1972 his work \"Armenia in the documents of international diplomacy and Soviet foreign policy\" appeared in print. His final major work was the two-volume monograph \"The Young Turks before the law court of history\" (1982 and 1983). For these major works the author was awarded a State Prize of the Armenian SSR.\n\nIn his treatise \"The Young Turks before the law court of history\", Kirakosyan set out to uncover the political essence of the Young Turks and the hollowness of their slogan \"liberty, equality and justice\", and to reveal the historical truths about the tragedy that befell the Armenians in Turkey, whose murder and deportation in 1915 provoked the censure of the world. Through a comparative analysis of an enormous quantity of multilingual and diverse sources and a thorough study of newly unearthed sources, Kirakosyan showed how contemporary Turkish historians were acting as attorneys covering up the monstrous crimes of Sultan Abdul-Hamid II and the Young Turks. He also put forth his belief that the genocidal campaign against the Armenians was aimed not only at their physical destruction but was directed against Russia as well, the country which was the main obstacle on the way to realizing the goals of pan-Turkism. The apex of the Young Turks' many atrocities was the extirpation during World War I of more than a million Armenians, a crime against humanity that would come to be known as the Armenian Genocide.\n\nIn reference to Turkish historians subverting history for political ends, Kirakosyan noted that \"with a calm conscience they sacrifice truth and the principles of scientific objectivity and serve falsification and lies\".\n\nProfessor Kirakosyan was one of the most widely read and respected of Armenian historians.

{"id": "232462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232462", "title": "Knowledge economy", "text": "Knowledge economy\n\nThe knowledge economy is the use of knowledge (savoir, savoir-faire, savoir-être) to generate tangible and intangible values. Technology, and in particular, knowledge technology, helps to incorporate part of human knowledge into machines. This knowledge can be used by decision support systems in various fields to generate economic value. Knowledge economy is also possible without technology.\n\nThe term was popularized by Peter Drucker as the title of Chapter 12 in his book \"The Age of Discontinuity\" (1969), that Drucker attributed to economist Fritz Machlup, originating in the idea of \"scientific management\" developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor.\n\nOther than the agricultural-intensive economies and labor-intensive economies, the global economy is in transition to a \"knowledge economy\", as an extension of an \"information society\" in the Information Age led by innovation. The transition requires that the rules and practices that determined success in the industrial economy need rewriting in an interconnected, globalized economy where knowledge resources such as trade secrets and expertise are as critical as other economic resources.\n\nA key concept of the knowledge economy is that knowledge and education (often referred to as \"human capital\") can be treated as one of the following two:\n\n\nIt can be defined as:\n\nThe initial foundation for the knowledge economy was introduced in 1966 in the book \"The Effective Executive\" by Peter Drucker. In this book, Drucker described the difference between the manual worker (page 2) and the knowledge worker. The manual worker, according to him, works with their hands and produces goods or services. In contrast, a knowledge worker (page 3) works with their head, not hands, and produces ideas, knowledge, and information.\n\nThe key problem in the formalization and modeling of knowledge economy is a vague definition of \"knowledge\", which is a rather relative concept. For example, it is not proper to consider \"information society\" as interchangeable with \"knowledge society\". \"Information\" is usually not equivalent to \"knowledge\". Their use depends on individual and group \"preferences\" (see the cognitive IPK model) which are \"economy-dependent\".\n\nThe knowledge economy is also seen as the latest stage of development in global economic restructuring. Thus far, the developed world has transitioned from an agricultural economy (pre-Industrial Age, largely the agrarian sector) to industrial economy (with the Industrial Age, largely the manufacturing sector) to post-industrial/mass production economy (mid-1900s, largely the service sector) to knowledge economy (late 1900s – 2000s, largely the technology/human capital sector). This latest stage has been marked by the upheavals in technological innovations and the globally competitive need for innovation with new products and processes that develop from the research community (i.e., R&D factors, universities, labs, educational institutes).\n\nIn the knowledge economy, the specialized labor force is characterized as computer literate and well-trained in handling data, developing algorithms and simulated models, and innovating on processes and systems. Harvard Business School Professor, Michael Porter, asserts that today’s economy is far more dynamic and that comparative advantage is less relevant than competitive advantage which rests on “making more productive use of inputs, which requires continual innovation\". Consequently, the technical STEM careers including computer scientists, engineers, chemists, biologists, mathematicians, and scientific inventors will see continuous demand in years to come. Additionally, well-situated clusters, which Michael Porter argues is vital in global economies, connect locally with linked industries, manufacturers, and other entities that are related by skills, technologies, and other common inputs. Hence, knowledge is the catalyst and connective tissue in modern economies.\n\nWith Earth’s depleting natural resources, the need for green infrastructure, a logistics industry forced into just-in-time deliveries, growing global demand, regulatory policy governed by performance results, and a host of other items high priority is put on knowledge; and research becomes paramount. Knowledge provides the technical expertise, problem-solving, performance measurement and evaluation, and data management needed for the trans-boundary, interdisciplinary global scale of today’s competition.\n\nWorldwide examples of the knowledge economy taking place among many others include: Silicon Valley in California; aerospace and automotive engineering in Munich, Germany; biotechnology in Hyderabad, India; electronics and digital media in Seoul, South Korea; petrochemical and energy industry in Brazil. Many other cities and regions try to follow a knowledge-driven development paradigm and increase their knowledge base by investing in higher education and research institutions in order to attract high skilled labor and better position themselves in the global competition. Yet, despite digital tools democratizing access to knowledge, research shows that knowledge economy activities remain as concentrated as ever in traditional economic cores.\n\nIt has been suggested that the next evolutionary step after knowledge economy is the network economy, where the relatively localized knowledge is now being shared among and across various networks for the benefit of the network members as a whole, to gain economic of scale in a wider, more open scale. It has been hypothesized that the gradual evolution of network economy would create a well interconnected economic order, which would then begin to concentrate on the passion of individuals, gradually leading to a Passion based economy.\n\nCommentators suggest there are various interlocking driving forces, which are changing the rules of business and national competitiveness:\n\n\nAs a result, goods and services can be developed, bought, sold, and in many cases even delivered over electronic networks.\n\nAs regards the applications of any new technology, this depends on how it meets economic demand. It can remain dormant or make a commercial breakthrough (see diffusion of innovation).\n\nIt can be argued that the knowledge economy differs from the traditional economy in several key respects:\n\n\nThese characteristics require new ideas and approaches from policy makers, managers and knowledge workers.\n\nThe knowledge economy has manifold forms in which it may appear but there are predictions that the new economy will extend radically, creating a pattern in which even ideas will be recognised and identified as a commodity.\n\nThe technology requirements for an Innovative System as described by the World Bank Institute must be able to disseminate a unified process by which a working method may converge scientific and technology solutions, and organizational solutions. According to the World Bank Institute‘s definition, such innovation would further enable the World Bank Institute‘s vision outlined in their Millennium Development Goals.\n\nThe United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development report (UNCSTD, 1997) concluded that for developing countries to successfully integrate ICTs and sustainable development in order to participate in the knowledge economy they need to intervene collectively and strategically. Such collective intervention suggested would be in the development of effective national ICT policies that support the new regulatory framework, promote the selected knowledge production, and use of ICTs and harness their organizational changes to be in line with the Millennium Development Goals. The report further suggests that developing countries to develop the required ICT strategies and policies for institutions and regulations taking into account the need to be responsive to the issues of convergence.\n\n"}

He was a mysterious person of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy who played a very significant role in the Balkans. Because of his mentors Gyula Andrássy and especially Béni Kállay he became an inevitable counselor in all Balkan affairs even to the emperor Franz Joseph himself, to ministers and to the government of the empire. He was also a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n\nThallóczy became interested in heraldry in a period when scientific circles became interested to select the \"right\" coat of arms for Bosnia and Herzegovina. His main interests were Bosnian history, especially genealogy, heraldry and biographies of prominent individuals from its medieval period. Supported by Thallóczy's selective use of tendentiously interpreted sources aimed to satisfy the political aspirations of the empire by representing a historically connected fate of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Austria-Hungary the government imposed his proposal for the official coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1889. He introduced ethnically neutral yellow and red combination of colors to confront \"misuse of Serbian and Croatian colors\". He was referred to as the 'creator of Bosnia'.\n\nThallóczy was transferred to Vienna at the request of Béni Kállay. He was in charge of cultural and educational issues in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He published numerous Cyrillic and Latin charters, and also works about the duke Hrvoje Vukčić, history of Jajce and numerous other, Bosnia-related, subjects, with the main findings published in the book \"Studien zur Geschichte Bosniens und Serbiens im Mittelalter\", published in Munich and Leipzig in the year 1914.\n\nBefore the First World War Austria-Hungary was significantly interested in Albania because of the political and military plans it had on Balkans and sent its scholars to investigate it. Partly because of this interest Thallóczy was employed within Austria-Hungary administration with title of court counselor to create one work on popular history of Albanians and one textbook. Together with Milan Šufflay and Konstantin Jireček he wrote two volumes of his monumental work \n\"Acta et diplomata res Albaniae mediae aetatis illustrantia\" () published in 1913 and 1918. Serbian historian Milorad Ekmečić credits him with having designed the 14th-century flag and coat of arms of Albania (the black double-headed eagle on a red banner).\n\nWhile some circles in Italy had plans to establish closer connection of Montenegro and Northern Albanian Catholics under their leadership, Thallóczy was one of the promoters of the plans of Austria-Hungary for strengthening the otherness between them and confronting Albanians and Slavs. The aim was to counter advances of Serbia and Montenegro on Adriatic coast. In December 1897 Thallóczy stated that it is necessary to take actions to prevent population of Albania being attracted to Montenegro. According to Fan Noli Thallóczy proclaimed that opinions about Skanderbeg's Serbian descent are legends.\n\nDuring World War I he was civil counselor of the military administration in occupied Kingdom of Serbia. Thallóczy died in a train accident while returning from the funeral of the emperor Franz Joseph I.\n\n\n\nHe referred to claims that Skanderbeg was of Serbian descent as legend.\n\n"}

Elly was at the time married to Rudolf Deutelbaum, Erich's uncle, who had taken Erich as his trainee. In 1938, Rudolf and Elly divorced, and Erich sued to be recognized as Otto's legitimate father. Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, in 1939, Erich Schön was arrested by the Gestapo and in 1942 transported from a concentration camp in Germany to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Rudolf Deutelbaum, along with his second wife Ilona and daughter Eva Deutelbaumová (Otto's half-sister), were deported in September 1942 to Theresienstadt Ghetto. In October 1942 they were deported to Treblinka extermination camp where they were murdered. Otto Kulka and his mother were deported in September 1942 to the Theresienstadt Ghetto, and from there, in September 1943, to the Theresienstadt family camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. His mother died in the Stutthof concentration camp in January 1945. After the war, he and his father returned to Czechoslovakia. To commemorate Erich's wife and Otto's mother they changed their family name to Kulka on the 23rd of April, 1946.\n\nKulka immigrated to Israel in March 1949 and joined the Kibbutz Kfar Hamaccabi. He added a Hebrew name – Dov – to his original name. Since 1958 he has lived in Jerusalem. He is married to Chaia Kulka and is the father of a daughter, Eliora Kulka-Soroka.\nKulka began his academic studies in 1958, at the Hebrew University, and in 1966 joined the faculty of its Department of the History of the Jewish People.\nHe retired as professor emeritus in 1999 and since then has kept up his research activity and continued to publish scholarly and other works.\n\nThe aesthetician Tomáš Kulka is his brother.\n\nKulka studied philosophy and history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at Goethe University Frankfurt. The subject of his doctoral thesis (1975) was \"The 'Jewish Question' in the Third Reich. Its Significance in National Socialist Ideology and Politics and its Role in Determining the Status and Activities of the Jews\". \nIn 1985, he was appointed an associate professor, and in 1991 a full professor in the Hebrew University's Department of the History of the Jewish People. In 1984-1985 he was a Visiting Professor at Harvard University. Since 1988 he has held the Sol Rosenbloom Chair in Jewish History. He retired from teaching in 1999 after being diagnosed with cancer. He conducts his current research within the framework of the Hebrew University's Institute of Jewish Studies; his research projects on German Jewry under the Nazi regime are supported by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development (GIF).\n\nKulka was for many years a member of the board of directors of Yad Vashem and continues to sit on the board of the Leo Baeck Institute for the Study of German and Central European Jewry. He is a member of the editorial board of the bilingual (Hebrew and English) journal \"Yad Vashem Studies.\"\n\nFor his book \"Deutsches Judentum unter dem Nationalsozialismus\" (\"German Jewry under the National-Socialist Regime\" 1997):\nFor his book \"Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death\" (\"Landschaften der Metropole des Todes\"):\n\nFrom the outset of his academic activity, Kulka developed a conceptual and methodological approach to the study of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust which departed from the prevailing one-dimensional focus on the persecution and annihilation of the Jews. He maintained that the study of the history of the Jews under Nazism should follow the same scholarly principles that are applied to every historical period. Within this framework, he discerned three major topics of research: (1) Nazi ideology and policy on the Jews; (2) the attitude of the German population toward the regime's policy on the Jews and toward the Jews themselves; and (3) the Jewish society and its leadership. This comprehensive picture was then examined in the light of historical continuity and change. Only from this perspective, Kulka argued, could the question of the Nazi period's singularity and the \"Final Solution\" be properly addressed.\n\nIn line with this conception, Kulka made an effort to avoid using the terms \"Shoah\" or \"Holocaust\", neither of which, in his opinion, accurately encapsulates this period within the continuity of Jewish history and does not convey its singularity. Instead, he refers to \"the history of the Jews under the National-Socialist regime,\" and, more frequently, to the \"Final Solution.\" The first phrase derives from his methodological approach, holding that this period should be studied like any other and in the context of its historical continuity, in the three dimensions mentioned above. As for the term \"Final Solution,\" Kulka considers it the most precise and most telling articulation of the teleological meaning of Nazi ideology and of the purpose underlying the realization of its goal: the termination of the historical existence of the Jewish people and the extermination of each individual Jew, as well as the eradication of the \"Jewish spirit\" (\"jüdischer Geist\") manifested in the European cultural heritage. It is here, that Kulka identifies the singularity of this period in Jewish and human history. As a scholar, Kulka has strictly separated the study of the historical past from his personal biography during the Second World War. As he noted in 2010, after completing the last of his major research projects to date, he regarded his biographical past irrelevant to historical research, and intertwining the two spheres as illegitimate. It was only in 2012, that he decided to publish a book bearing a different character. In this work, Kulka explores his memory images from the years he spent in the ghetto of Theresienstadt and in Auschwitz Birkenau, and reflects on them as a historian and thinker. First published in English in 2013 as \"Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death\", Reflections on Memory and Imagination, the book has been widely translated.\n\nIn his research on modern antisemitism, Kulka drew, among other sources, on studies by his university teachers, the historians Jacob Talmon and Shmuel Ettinger, applying their insights to his empirical findings about National-Socialist ideology and policy. To gain a broader perspective, he examined the centrality of the ambivalent Jewish component in the major trends of Western culture in the modern age, as well as the radicalization of the elements of antagonism toward Judaism and the Jews within them. He explores these developments against the background of the secularization process of central ideological movements since the seventeenth century, the most radical of which in the twentieth century was Nazism.\nIn 1989, Kulka articulated his approach succinctly:\n\nMany scholarly works written on National Socialism over the past three decades have reached the conclusion that antisemitism played a vital role in the ideology and policy of the Third Reich. Of all the ideological and political ingredients that went into the making of Hitler's outlook, antisemitism, in its broadest sense, appears to be not only the one consistent and immutable element, it also bridges such seemingly contradictory leanings as anti-Marxism and anti-capitalism, the struggle against democracy and modernism, and a basic anti-Christian disposition. [...] Yet Hitler consistently portrays this ideological war in the international arena as an extension of the struggle that the National Socialist movement had waged, from its inception, against its ideological and political enemies within Germany itself: Jewish Marxism, Jewish parliamentary democracy, Jewish capitalism, and even the \"Political Churches\" and the Jewish foundations of Christianity. In the movement's racial-determinist conception, the Jews stand in an obviously dominant relationship to all these forces and factors as the biological source of doctrines and ideologies whose most radical expression is Bolshevism but whose origin was Judaism's introduction of Christianity into the Western world. National Socialist antisemitism traced the sense of crisis that dogged the modern world to its domination by 'Jewish-Christian-Bolshevik' principles that were based on a universalist 'destructive' belief in the unity of the world and the equality of men in all spheres of life. These principles were antithetical to the Nazi Social-Darwinist version of the 'natural order', i.e., the inherent inequality of the races and the eternal struggle between them for their very survival. Hence only the restoration of this order – which was conditional upon the absolute annihilation, physical and spiritual, of Judaism – could ensure the future health, indeed the very existence of the human race.\n\nIn an interview for the Hebrew-language newspaper \"Haaretz\" in 2013 he said, \n\nMy conclusion in regard to Nazi antisemitism is that it would have been impossible without the history of traditional Jew-hatred, but that the Final Solution would have been unfeasible in a traditional Christian society. This is because the existence of Judaism was a necessity in Christianity's perception of redemption: the idea that the Jews will recover from their blindness in the last days and see the light. However, only secularization and secular political messianism made possible the totalistic 'redemptive anti-Semitism' which was inherent in Nazi ideology and its attempt to change the course of human history.\n\nIndeed, in his very first scholarly paper, \"Richard Wagner and the Origins of Modern Antisemitism\" (1961), Kulka identified and analyzed the phenomenon of \"redemptive antisemitism.\" This was an ideology of political messianism, which in its various metamorphoses led ultimately to National-Socialist antisemitism and the \"Final Solution.\" The term \"redemptive antisemitism\" has become, particularly since the 1990s, a reference point in research about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.\n\nKulka published a monumental documentary study on this subject, which originally appeared in German, the language of the sources, in 2004, and in 2010 in an expanded edition in English. Decades earlier, in the mid-1960s, Kulka was one of the pioneers of scholarly research into this subject, later collaborating with his German colleague Eberhard Jäckel and the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw. Kulka had laid the methodological and theoretical foundations for these studies already in his seminal article of 1975, 'Public Opinion, in \"National-Socialist Germany and the 'Jewish Question\".\" He showed that beneath the monolithic totalitarian encasement a certain diversity of social structures and political opinions remained from the pre-Nazi period. This was also reflected in the population's consent to the regime's policy toward the Jews, in various forms of criticism of that policy, and on the other hand, in anti-Jewish violence and \"pressure from below\" to accelerate and radicalize the policy of the \"solution of the Jewish question in Germany.\"\nHowever, the dominant trend, as emerged clearly, was the constantly expanding and ever more extreme \"removal\" of the Jews from all spheres of life of the \"German people's community\" (Volksgemeinschaft) and finally from all of Germany.\n\nDrawing on these sources, Kulka devoted a special study to the complex problem of the attitude taken by the churches and the religious population in Germany toward the Jews, including those who converted to Protestantism and Catholicism.\nIn another study based on the above-mentioned highly reliable source material Kulka devoted a special article to the examination of another aspect - the popular opinion in Nazi Germany and the government's attitude toward the Jews. In this study he revealed the influence of the popular opinion as \"a factor in the policy of the 'solution of the Jewish question'.\"\n\nKulka also considered it important to probe the abundant detailed information contained in these reports about the life of the Jews and their organized activity as they coped with both the regime's policy and the attitude of the German population toward them. He viewed the picture that emerged of the diverse, systematic, and continuous information that was presented to the various levels of the regime as a significant supplementary to what could be gleaned from the contemporary Jewish sources. Both types of sources show a thrust toward continuity – though organized Jewish activity is seen to undergo transformations. It became more intense as a dialectical response to the growing and consistently more acute efforts to remove the Jews from the various spheres of life of the German state and society.\n\nThe most critical question of the research concerned the German population and the \"Final Solution.\" Prior to the publication of Kulka and Jäckel's documentation project, scholars – among them Kulka himself, Marlis Steinert, and Ian Kershaw – interpreted the reports' apparent silence regarding the Jews during the war years as reflecting the German population's indifference to the Jews' fate. According to Steinert and Kershaw, the German population took little interest in the Jews and their fate \"because they had other things on their mind during the period of the war.\" At that time, Kulka viewed this apparent indifference, in the light of the reports about mass murder of Jews being perpetrated in \"the east,\" as \"abyssal indifference.\"\n\nKulka and Jäckel published nearly 4,000 reports on German public opinion and the Jews, close to 1000 of them from the war years. According to Kulka, in their light the assumption about the silence of the sources no longer meets the criterion of empirical research. The documentation also supported Kulka's earlier findings, described in his article of 1975, concerning the widespread reports that circulated among the German population about the mass annihilation of the deported Jews. In the newly found documentation from early 1942, the general consensus reported from most areas of the Third Reich was that the population wished to see all the Jews deported from Germany (in the German original: \"Am meisten würde jedoch eine baldige Abschiebung aller Juden aus Deutschland begrüßt werden\"). This attitude persisted despite the population's knowledge about the fate of the deported Jews, as evident from many accurate reports. Here, then, the term \"abyssal indifference\" takes on concrete meaning. As Kulka and Jäckel note at the closing of the Introduction to the English edition of their book: \"The conclusion that can be derived from the reports on popular opinion, and from the subsequent published studies based on our edition, is a harsh one indeed.\"\n\nThis is a subject to which Kulka devoted a series of research articles as well as a book, \"German Jewry Under the National-Socialist Regime\". His research was based on his project to reconstruct the lost archives of the central Jewish organization in the years 1932-1939, the National Representation of the Jews of Germany (Reichsvertretung der deutschen Juden), and his archival discovery of its successor organization in the years 1939-1945, the \"Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland.\" Revising the prevailing historiography, Kulka showed that the National Representation of the Jews of Germany was not established in 1933, after the Nazis' rise to power, but that its foundations were laid a year earlier, in 1932.\n\nIn the light of the rapidly deteriorating political situation, the Jewish leadership in the various district states (Länder) realized that it was essential to create a united central organization to represent German Jewry vis-à-vis the regime. Similarly, Kulka showed that the successor to the National Representation, namely the National Association of Jews in Germany, was not established in 1939 after the Kristallnacht pogrom, solely at the order of the Nazi regime. In fact, it emerged under this name, and within a new central framework as the national organization of all the Jews in Germany, in the course of a lengthy internal process in 1938.\n\nKulka's comprehensive article, \"Germany,\" in the \"Encyclopedia of the Holocaust\", offers an overview of the developments among German Jewry in this period within their historical context, integrating the three areas of his research on this subject. Summing up his analysis of the status and activities of the Jewish society under the Nazi regime, he wrote:\n\nAmong the Jews, the reaction to what was happening was different on the individual and the organizational level. Although the Jews' social and political status had suffered a tremendous blow, their existing organizational network was scarcely touched – indeed, new organizations came into being. In this respect the situation of Jews was in stark contrast to the prevailing trend of totalitarian Gleichschaltung, the purpose of which was to destroy the existing social and political fabric of German society and construct a homogeneous society (Volksgemeinschaft) in its place. It was the exclusionary racist principle on which the policy towards the Jews was based – their separation and isolation from the general society – that made possible the continuing existence of the Jew's own institutions. Moreover, \"alien\" and \"decadent\" ideas and principles such as political pluralism and democracy, which were now beyond the pale among the general population, were still the rule in Jewish public life. This was, however, the freedom of the outcasts, of a community that now seemed doomed to disappearance.\n\nAccording to Kulka, German Jewry faced three alternatives upon the establishment of the Nazi regime and the promulgation of the first anti-Jewish decrees in 1933.\n\nThe first alternative was the disintegration and atomization of Jewish society and the paralysis of all its institutions and organizations under the impact of the anti-Jewish waves of terror and legislation. In the lives of individuals, this was manifested in a hasty mass flight from Germany, the desperate return of some, and in extreme cases, through suicide. The second alternative, advocated by a small minority of so-called Nationaldeutsche Juden, was diametrically opposed to the first. It was the temptation to draw the ostensibly inevitable conclusions from the crisis and failure of the democratic system of Weimar, and by the same token from the failure of the internal democratic principles of the Jewish society, and introduce in their place – for all of German Jewry – a regime of authoritarian leadership based on the Führerprinzip. However, most Jewish organizations opted for a third alternative: the continued existence of the democratic-pluralistic institutions of the Jewish society from the post-Emancipation period and the establishment of a new all-inclusive central organization based on the principle of the voluntary affiliation of each body and free activity within the organization.\n\nKulka sums up his approach to the study of this period in the history of German Jewry as follows: \n\nIn my attempt to present the basic tendencies in the development of Jewish life from 1933 on, there are two different dimensions of time: the historical dimension of time and the time dimension of the Third Reich – defined teleologically, the period of the Final Solution. The first dimension explores this time against the background of continuity: what existed before 1933 and continued even if under an altered guise after that watershed. The second dimension relates to what was significantly new and novel, introduced and developed under the new regime. Both dimensions must be examined side by side. Of course, the first was predominant until 1938/1939, the second from then on to 1943 or even 1945.\n\nA key element of Kulka's research on Nazi Germany and the Holocaust period is devoted to its historiography. The subject is addressed in several of his seminal articles. His article on the German historiography of National-Socialism and the \"Jewish Question\" from 1924 to 1984 was the first and most systematic on this complex topic until the publication of Nicolas Berg's comprehensive book on the subject in 2003.\nAnother study discusses the basic tendencies in Zionist historiography of the Jews under the Nazi regime. His basic scholarly reviews on the historiography of the Holocaust period include extensive discussions devoted to two monumental two-volume works: Saul Friedländer's \"Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Persecution, 1933-1939\"; and \"The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945\"; and Ian Kershaw's biography of Hitler: \"Hitler 1889-1936. Hubris\"; and \"Hitler 1936-1945. Nemesis\".\n\nOther studies by Kulka extend the exploration of the history of the Jews under the Nazi regime beyond Germany. These include: a joint project of the Hebrew University and the University of Vienna about Austria's Jewish citizens who found refuge from Nazi persecution in Mandate Palestine, and their life in Israel; an article on Czech Jewry from the establishment of the First Czechoslovak Republic, in 1918, until after the Munich Conference and the end of the Second Republic, in March 1939; and a comparative study on the history of the Jews in Germany and Czechoslovakia between the two world wars and in the Holocaust period.\n\nIn all his studies of the Nazi period, Kulka refrained from dealing with the final stage of the physical annihilation of the Jews in the death camps and with the mass executions in the German-occupied areas of Eastern Europe. His only departure from this practice was an article based on his discovery of unknown documents on the \"family camp\" of Jews from the Theresienstadt Ghetto in Auschwitz-Birkenau and its place in the Nazis' policy of camouflage and deception about the deportation of the Jews to the \"east\" for extermination. The article was published in 1984 in Hebrew as \"Ghetto in an Annihilation Camp. The 'Family Camp' of the Theresienstadt Jews in Auschwitz, 1943-1944,\" and simultaneously in an English-language version with a significant difference in the title: \"Ghetto in an Annihilation Camp. Jewish Social History in the Holocaust Period and its Ultimate Limits.\" It deals, \"inter alia\", with the continuity of the patterns of life and the basic values of the Jewish society even in the very heart of the Auschwitz annihilation camp and in the face of a clear awareness of the certainty of death. The purpose of this special camp's existence and the reason for its liquidation – part of the policy of Adolf Eichmann's Jewish section in the Reich Security Main Office – did not become clear until long after the war. The riddle was solved when Kulka discovered a secret exchange of correspondence between Eichmann and his staff and the German Red Cross in Berlin, and between the latter and the headquarters of the International Red Cross in Geneva. This almost unknown episode was thus accorded its rightful place in Holocaust historiography. The article was reprinted as an appendix to shed light on the historical background of Kulka's \"extra-scientific\" book, \"Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death\".\n\nIn 1982, Kulka initiated a large-scale international conference within the framework of his activity in the Historical Society of Israel and his research on the relations between Judaism and Christianity in the modern era. Its theme was \"Judaism and Christianity under the impact of National-Socialism from 1919 to 1945, in Germany and in all the European countries occupied by the Third Reich, its allies and vassal states.\" The volume of the conference's proceedings, edited by Kulka and published in 1987 by the Historical Society of Israel, has become a reference point for research and discussion about this highly charged, complex issue.\n\nAmong Kulka's studies of other historical periods, a special place is occupied by his seminal Hebrew-language study on sixteenth century Jewish Prague in its Central European setting. Titled \"The Historical Background of the National and Educational Teachings of MaHaRaL from Prague\", it appeared in the jubilee volume of the periodical \"Zion\". The subtitle in the English-language abstract encapsulates the article's thrust: \"A Suggested New Approach to the Study of MaHaRaL.\" Kulka's point of departure is Maharal's quasi-modern ideas, which had proved puzzling to many scholars. He too addresses the singularity of these ideas, reflected in the following quotation from Maharal's \"Netzach Yisrael\" concerning the substance of nations, their religious faith, and their place in creation:\n\n\"It is unworthy for a nation to be subjugated and yoked to another [nation], for the Holy One, blessed be He, created each and every nation unto itself. [...] For man chooses divinity which he will resemble in part. [...] Every nation chooses its divinity according to its own thoughts...\"\nAs for the Jewish people, its exile from its land and its redemption according to the same order of creation, Kulka continues to quote from Maharal with his unique style:\n\nThere is no doubt that the exile is a change and a departure from the order in which the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered each nation in its proper place and ordered Israel in their proper place, which is the Land of Israel. Exile from the place is a change and a complete departure, and all things, when they depart from their natural place [...] are unsustainable in the place that is not natural to them, until they return to their natural place. For if they were to remain in the place that is unnatural to them, what was unnatural to them would become natural, and this is something that is not possible, for the unnatural to become natural.\n\nIn his study, Kulka shed new light on the historical research into Maharal's ideas on nationhood and education, against a diverse background of sources and in the light of the contemporary political, social, and religious situation in Central Europe. According to Kulka it is inadequate to analyze Maharal's views only in the light of the writings of his Jewish contemporaries and predecessors. Insight about the distinctiveness of Maharal's ideas concerning nationhood and education, and the connection between them, could be gained by observing the historical setting in which he was active and examining possible influences to which he was susceptible in those specific circumstances. In his study of Maharal's national theory, Kulka thus probes the different channels through which Maharal was exposed to the distinctive fusion of religion and nationalism of post-Hussitic Bohemia in the Reformation era, not omitting national conflicts and the relations between the nations. Through the prism of this historical context, Kulka is able to address convincingly the singularity and originality of Maharal's creative Jewish thought and its relevance for his time.\n\nKulka applies a similar methodological approach in his inquiry into Maharal's innovative educational theory. One striking result of his research is the solution to the deeply puzzling similarities between Maharal's educational doctrine and that of the \"teacher of nations\", Jan Amos Comenius, as set forth by Aharon Kleinberger. According to Kleinberger, the fact that Comenius was just 17 when the Maharal died excludes the possibility that he influenced Maharal; and, ipso facto, the reverse influence is equally untenable. However, Kulka proves that Comenius, the last bishop of the humanistic Christian denomination of the Bohemian Brethren (in Latin: Unitas Fratrum), was the successor and codifier of the educational theories and methods of his teachers in this sect, who were Maharal's contemporaries and interlocutors.\n\nThis study concentrates initially on the twenty years of Maharal's tenure as \"head of the [Jewish] communities of the State of Moravia,\" (אב בית דין וראש מדינת מעהרין) in close proximity to the educational center of the Bohemian Brethren. This center, with its superb Hebraists, translated and published the magnificent Czech-language edition of the Bible – Bible kralická. Some of Maharal's discussions and disputes with \"Christian sages,\" which appear in his writings, took place in this milieu. Moreover, Kulka's approach, which sets Maharal within the relevant historical context, is not inconsistent with an appreciation of his creative originality. Although anchored in the reality of their time, Maharal's ideas draw on far deeper sources and bear implications that far transcend this period.\n\nThese issues, including Kulka's study, were discussed extensively in an international conference about Maharal, held in Jerusalem in 2009 to mark the four hundredth anniversary of his death. The conference's sponsors – the Israel Academy of Sciences and the Humanities and the Historical Society of Israel – are to publish the proceedings.\n\nKulka's book, \"Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death. Reflections on Memory and Imagination\", was published almost simultaneously in various European languages and worldwide during 2013-14. It is fundamentally different from his scholarly works, as he attests in the introduction:\n\nI assume that readers of my historical publications will have identified me unequivocally with an attitude of strict and impersonally remote research, always conducted within well-defined historical categories, as a kind of self-contained method unto itself. But few are aware of the existence within me of a dimension of silence, of a choice I made to sever the biographical from the historical past. [...] The hidden meaning of the metaphoric language of the central, recurrent motifs in the book, such as 'immutable law of the death', the 'Great Death', the 'Metropolis of Death', reaches beyond the experience of the world of Auschwitz. They are metaphors for what at the time seemed to expand into a world order that would change the course of human history and remained so in my reflective memory. I am also aware that these texts, though anchored in concrete historical events, transcend the sphere of history.\n\nThe book was extensively discussed in the press and the electronic media in Israel and throughout the world, particularly in England, France, and Germany. Most reviewers commented on its different style of language and observation amid the rich literature of the Holocaust period, and remarked on its special place alongside the autobiographical works of Saul Friedländer, Primo Levi, and Imre Kertész. Writing in the British \"Guardian\" newspaper, Thomas W. Laqueur noted, \"Primo Levi's testimony, it is often said, is that of a chemist: clear, cool, precise, distant. So with Kulka's work: this is the product of a master historian – ironic, probing, present in the past, able to connect the particular with the cosmic.\" And, in \"Le Monde\", Nicolas Weill wrote, \"A book that defies categorization in any conventional genre. [...] The lucidity and temperance that accompany this stunning return to the past arouse amazement and astonishment.\"\nThe book received two prestigious literary awards in Germany and Britain: The Geschwister-Scholl Prize and the Jewish Quarterly Literary Wingate Prize.\n\nCzech historian Anna Hájková of University of Warwick criticized Kulka's book \"Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death: Reflections on Memory and Imagination\" for omitting his father and sister who died in Treblinka death camp. This, in spite of the following clear declaration of the author: \"These recordings were neither historical testimony nor autobiographical memoir, but the reflections [...] of memory and imagination that have remained from the world of the wondering child of ten to eleven that I had once been\".\n"}

Originally a member of the Socialist Youth League (SUF), together with some of the later founders of the Workers' Communist Party, Linné Eriksen was excluded in 1969. He later became involved in the Socialist Left Party. In May 2011 he left the Socialist Left Party due to its support for the Norwegian participation in the Libyan war, and its environmental and development policies.\n\nLinné Eriksen finally graduated from the University of Trondheim with a cand.philol. degree in 1974.

He has, however, not discontinued his African studies. The 2000 \"Norway and National Liberation in Southern Africa\" was followed by a 2002 book on Nelson Mandela, which received a prize from the Norwegian Ministry of Culture.
